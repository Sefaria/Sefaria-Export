Malbim on Genesis



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>You certainly will not die.</b> If Chavah had not ascribed a rational explanation to the prohibition (“lest you die”) but merely said that Hashem had commanded it, the serpent could not have lured her into sin by challenging her explanation.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>They heard the voice.</b> Before the sin they were able to communicate with Hashem directly, as Moshe did, without the assistance of the imagination. Therefore their prophecies were accompanied by no sensory perceptions, either audible or visual. That is why they experienced no fright, unlike later prophets. Now, however, their physical natures had become dominant and their prophecies were cloaked in more tangible garb.

Verse 9

<b>Where are you.</b> That is, where are you spiritually? See how you have fallen!

Verse 10

<b>What have you done.</b> Hashem informed him: 1) that he had free will and that his deeds were therefore attributable to him, and 2) that while crimes against Divine law are punished by special acts of Providence, crimes against natural law, such as murder, are punished by nature itself.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6



Verse 1


<b>Daughters were born to them.</b> Where polygamy is the rule many more girls are born than boys.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>His days shall be.</b> Hashem saw that their long life spans were not to their benefit because after years of struggle the body inevitably defeated the soul, dragging it down to its own level.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Adonoy saw.</b> Hashem saw that even reducing their life spans to 120 years did not cause them to repent. This was because their sins were the result of ideology as well as appetite.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>But Noach found favor.</b> If Noach had remained among his contemporaries he too would have been corrupted. Thus Hashem destroyed the entire generation only to save him. If, on the other hand, there had been no righteous person the world would have been spared, for Hashem only performs cruel acts if they will produce a positive result.

Verse 17

<b>Behold <i>I</i> am bringing.</b> It was necessary for Hashem to state this to refute the claim that the flood was a natural phenomenon brought on by conditions of the young earth.

Verse 1


<b>You and your household.</b> Noach was permitted to take all the contents of his house.

Verse 6



Verse 7


<b>The raven.</b> Since the raven, alone among the birds, produced offspring in the ark, Noach felt secure in sending it out knowing that the species would not perish. The raven was also the only bird that would have abandoned its nest to go on the mission.

Verse 31

<b>To go to the land of Canaan.</b> However, once they arrived in Charan, which was outside of Nimrod’s domain, they settled there. Providence prevented Terach from continuing on so that Avraham could separate himself from his father’s idol-worshipping household and so that only Avraham would receive Hashem’s blessing and the promise of the land.

<b>The Egyptians beheld.</b> Avraham stipulated an exorbitant sum for Sarah, which not even the officials could pay, therefore they praised her to Pharaoh.

Verse 5



Verse 6


<b>The land was unable to support them.</b> This was for two reasons: 1) There was insufficient room for their great wealth. 2) Lot had begun to deviate from Avraham’s ways, which is why they were unable to dwell together.

Chapter 14



Chapter 15



Chapter 16



Chapter 17



Verse 1


<b>Ninety-nine years old.</b> Since Yitzchak was to be holy from the womb and the progenitor of a holy nation, he was conceived after his father reached extreme old age when his physical nature was ebbing and his spiritual nature at its peak.

Verse 2

<b>I will give My covenant.</b> Hashem’s earlier covenant with him (15:18) was unilateral, but this one was “<i>between</i> Me and you,” imposing obligations upon both parties. Thus Avraham was also obliged to do his part to perfect creation, starting with his own body.

<b>This one came as an immigrant.</b> An immigrant is more deserving of punishment for violating local law than a native, especially in a place where immigrants are rarely accepted. <b>And now he wants to be a judge.</b> Lot had in fact been appointed a judge, which made his infringement even more serious.

Verse 11

<b>There is no fear of Elokim.</b> He informed him that even culture and refinement are no guarantee that a person’s passions will not overcome his intellect, leading him to commit the basest crimes. The only attribute that can be trusted to prevent him from sinning is fear — in particular fear of Heaven. <b>In this place.</b> There can be no fear of Heaven without belief in Providence.

<b>That she had born to Avraham.</b> Yishmael scoffed that only he was born to Avraham and that Yitzchok was fathered by Avimelech. Sarah understood that Hagar put the idea into his head out of jealousy.

<b>Remain here.</b> Avraham was reluctant that they should see him perform the very act that he had railed against and declared irrational when performed by idolaters.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>Now I know.</b> Hashem knew that even when Avraham spared his son’s life he did so only because he was commanded to do so. This was the proof that he was truly God-fearing.

Chapter 23



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>I am a foreigner (or “sojourner”) and a resident.</b> A sojourner does not usually purchase a family burial plot because he does not intend on remaining. Conversely, a resident does not need to buy one because he possesses his own land. Avraham, however, has been a sojourner until now but would like to become a resident. That is why he is seeking to purchase a plot.

Verse 5

<b>In the choicest of our grave sites.</b> Because you are so respected you may have the best grave in the public cemetery, or else you may request the private plot of anyone in town. But it is against our custom to allow a sojourner to acquire a plot of his own.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>Let him give me.</b> That is, as a present. <b>At the end of his field.</b> Although it is not customary to sell one’s inheritance, the cave is not in the main part of the field but at an extremity. <b>Let him give it to me for its full value.</b> Publicly let it be a gift, but privately he will receive full value.

Verse 11

<b>Beside a well of water.</b> Eliezer resolved to look for the daughter of a poor man, who would gladly allow her to move to another land to marry someone rich. Therefore he waited by a well outside of town, assuming that no rich man would send his daughter to such a place.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>He had not yet finished speaking.</b> Hashem arranged that the moment he finished speaking, Rivkah would appear. In fact, this was the first time she ever visited the well because her father had many servants to send. <b>And behold.</b> The word “behold” emphasizes that it was a surprising event.

Verse 13

<b>The man prospered.</b> Scripture attributes this prosperity to Yitzchok’s own merit rather than to the bounty of the land. <b>He continued to prosper.</b> He never suffered a setback, which demonstrated that his prosperity was not by chance. <b>Until he became very great.</b> If his prosperity had been the result of favorable circumstances it would have reached a limit and then been followed by a downturn.

<b>How is it that you found it so quickly.</b> Yitzchok had intentionally given Eisov an arduous assignment to increase his merit. <b>Hashem … brought it about for me.</b> I myself did not expect to find the prey so close by. <b>Your God.</b> This was a sign the animal was sent for this purpose in your merit.

<b>Yaakov rose.</b> Yaakov employed four strategies to conceal his flight. <b>His children and his wives.</b> He sent his family away before taking his belongings. <b>Upon the camels.</b> He seated them upon camels openly, as if going on an outing.

Verse 18

 <b>All his possessions.</b> He did not exchange his livestock for more easily transported currency. <b>To come to Yitzchok.</b> He acknowledged openly to Lavan’s household that he was leaving, so they assumed that he had Lavan’s permission and did not bother reporting it.

Verse 8

<b>Yaakov was very frightened.</b> When Yaakov realized that he was afraid despite Hashem’s assurance, he reckoned that he was not worthy of miraculous salvation and began preparing naturalistic stratagems instead.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>God of my father.</b> Yaakov mentions two reasons why he should not have been afraid: 1) because of the merits of his fathers, and 2) because of Hashem’s promise. And since neither involved his own merit, even sin should not have been a cause for concern.

<b>The sons … answered … with guile.</b> Although their anger was provoked primarily by Shechem’s acts of kidnapping and rape, they mentioned only his lack of circumcision. This deceived him into thinking that rectifying this would satisfy them.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>We will take our daughter and go.</b> Since Shechem was unaware that relations with the uncircumcised was a disgrace to them, there was nothing to avenge. With this answer they accomplished three things: 1) They concealed their desire for revenge. 2) They convinced him that circumcision was the only way to acquire Deenah. 3) They gave the impression that if everyone were circumcised they would stay.

<b>A long colorful cloak.</b> The other brothers were dressed like shepherds, but because Yoseif was his father’s attendant he was required to dress in a dignified manner.

Verse 8

<b>Will you be a king … will you rule.</b> They noted a contradiction in his dream — his sheaf arising on its own indicated that he would rule by force, but the surrounding of his sheaf by theirs indicated that they would crown him king voluntarily.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>From the depths of Chevron.</b> See Rashi. If Yaakov was concerned about the well being of ten grown men and their servants, how could he send the young Yoseif on his own to check up on them? Clearly this was the hand of Hashem.

<b>Please my master.</b> Knowing that they stood no chance of acquittal, he decided to plead for mercy rather than ask for justice. <b>A word.</b> He would speak briefly like a supplicant rather than at length like a defendant. <b>In my master’s ears.</b> A plea for mercy could be addressed only to the king. <b>Do not be angry.</b> I am asking for mercy, not a perversion of justice. <b>For you are equal to Pharaoh.</b> Like Pharaoh, you have the power to grant pardon.

<b>I shall be gathered.</b> When the souls of the righteous are released from their physical bodies they enter the company of other righteous souls to be connected with the source of eternal life. <b>Bring me … to my fathers.</b> Since his soul was to be united with the righteous, it was fitting that his body be buried with them as well, in anticipation of the time of the revival.
