<b>Zion</b> – This begins a new section now that the prophet has finished the prophecy which he spoke about Yehudah and Jerusalem from the beginning of the book until now. If you look carefully you will see that the rebuke which he delivered from the beginning of the book until the twenty first verse, which is the prophecy that particularly concerns Yehudah, was about acts between the people and Gd – sacrifices, repentance and prayer. Then most of the rebuke which he gives from the verse “How has she become a harlot…” (Isaiah 1:21) is dealing with matters between people like forgery, fraud and the perversion of justice. This is because sins against Gd were more common among the people of Yehudah who lived outside of Jerusalem, but in the capitol city of Jerusalem sins between people were more common because of the amount of business and trade done there. Now the seer closed his words by saying that each one will find his reparation through the sin he himself committed, and by fixing his crookedness he will return to his place. 
<b>Zion</b> – The capitol city which sinned through perverting justice. <b>Shall be redeemed through justice</b> – the moment you repent and do justice, you will be saved and redeemed. 
<b>And her penitent through righteousness</b> – This is referring to the tribe of Yehudah who returned to Zion from the exile, whose sin was in perverting righteousness between man and Gd. <b>They will be redeemed through righteousness</b> – by showing the righteousness of their actions before their Maker and Creator.

Verse 3






Out of Zion – There the Sanhedrin sat, with the High Priest and the king of the House of David. 
Shall the Torah come forth – To the whole world, as it is written “If a matter eludes you in judgment… then you shall rise and go up to the place the Lord, your God, chooses.” (Devarim 17:8) This occurs only in Zion. 
And the word of the Lord – This refers to words of prophecy. 
From Jerusalem – Because there the prophets gathered and drew the spirit of Gd from throughout the city, because the prophets did not sit in the Court of Hewn stones (with the Sanhedrin). All these are the words which the nations said to one another.

Verse 4

And he will judge – That is to say - just as they request, so it will be in truth because the judge at that time will be the messiah and he will judge, instruct and rebuke: between nations – because the need for the means of war is due to two things 1) between two peoples who do not have a shared religion the sword is necessary to judge and decide between them, 2) guarding the government and order within a particular country, that people not rebel and throw off the yoke of rule. In response to this it says that in that time these reasons will be nullified, because he will judge and rebuke in the matters that cause conflict between nations, and rebuke will be sufficient to stop many peoples from transgressing the law. Then, since they no longer need to wage war, perforce the will ‘beat their swords into plowshares’ and no more learn the ways of war:

Strength. To God, there are things such as strength and might. (Amitz refers to the consistency of strength without a sign of stopping. The speaker attributes strength like a hailstorm, and might like a storm of torrential rain) Strength like a hailstorm, this is [what is meant by] breaks cedars, and destructive tempest is a storm-wind that presses and cuts everything in its place, and if combined with the hail that flows in the strong wind, then it can uproot everything. Storm of torrential rain overflowing, for the hail destroys but does not flood anything in its place, but if water comes and flows afterward, then everything overflows and everything that the hail destroyed is lifted to a far place, and the hail is likened to the killing and destruction that the Assyrians did in their land, and the storm is likened to God who exiled the remenant to the Gozen river and the cities of Media. Cast, the hailstorm and overflowing rain, casts first the crown of pride to the land by hand [forcefully], and after that.

Verse 1

Comfort, comfort. You, prophets, comfort my people. And since the redemption will come either before its time because of merit, or if they receive complete punishment for their sins, or even if they aren't meritorious, He will redeem them at the set time, therefor it said "comfort" twice. 

Verse 2

<b>Because its set time is complete.</b> This means to say: either they will be redeemed at the time that the set time is complete. And this will be if they don't merit to be redeemed earlier than this. Or they will be redeemed before the time - <b>Because, for its sin is satisfied.</b> If their sins are satisfied with repentance and merit. Or because - <b>For it took from the Hand of God double.</b> That He will double their torments and punishments until the punishments and torment equal - <b>All of its sins.</b> For example, someone who it was decreed on him to sit in jail for ten years and get lashed ten times every day, and the jail master hits him one hundred times every day, he goes free. And so too it was in Egypt, that the hardship of the service finished the four hundred years in two hundred and ten.

Verse 3

.A voice rings out. He describes that he hears a voice that rings out, because the prophet sees this as if it already happened, and describes in contrast how at the time where the ringing is quiet for a moment, he heard a voice saying "Proclaim!" (Verse 6), like hurry up and do not wait a minute, as will be explained there. 
In the desert. The many wonders that were done for our forefathers when they left Egypt in the deserted wilderness, will now wander before the prophet in his Divine Inspiration, visualizing in his Inspiration that the path that G-d led them then, which was a way of miracles and intervention, were prepared for and also guarded the sons of their sons to pass through a second time at the time of the final redemption, like it says "I will show him wondrous deeds as in the days when you sallied forth from the land of Egypt. (Micah 7:15)", but in addition God will continue to reveal his strong hand also in a new course that was never done in the world, and He will work miracles and work wonders that were not created from older times. And there is a difference between "desert" and "wilderness", that just like in a settled land places of gardens and orchards were found, so too in a desert there are places of dryland and dugouts found which grow thorns and thistles, and this is called "wilderness". And there is a difference between "Clear a road" and "Level in the wilderness", that "Clear a road" is a road that that was already around, and the obstacle stones have been removed, but "Level in the wilderness" means that they should pave and raise a new path that was not already around, and there is a difference between "Lord" and "our God", like I explained in many places that the name "Lord" is called from the side that He is the Creator of the world and constantly renews it, and the name "God" particularly the name "our" (נו) teaches the attachment He has with the Israelites and the Divine Intervention that He sets apart for them to work wonders and work splendors. So it says here in the "desert" where the Israelites traveled when they left Egypt, and there is where the path of God already was from the pervious miracles, clear the road from obstacle stones, because now this road will be renewed and the miracles will be revealed a second time, however in the wilderness which is wilder than the desert, and the Israelites did not travel there, there they need a new highway that never existed, and this highway will be to our God, special to us in his wondrous love for us, and he will add miracles and signs and wonders that were never before revealed. 


Verse 4

"Every valley". He is describing how the path that is remembered which the children of exile will return on will be a straight path; the valleys and ridges will not delay them. Although it will be said that it will not be like the normal actions of the world that at the time that they want to straighten the way and a mountain and a hill and a valley is found in front of it, that then the mountain soil will travel into the valley, until the mountain is lowered and the valley is raised, in a way that according to nature a mountain and a hill will first be forced to be lowered, and because of this the valley will be filled. But if it will be that it is not by the way of nature, it will start out "Let every be raised," from itself, and afterwards, "Every hill and mountain be made low"....
"Let the rugged ground". Here is the way they would want to straighten the rugged ground, that the path is curved because there are many small rigid hills that they need to go around, so surely they will have to start by putting the ridges into a plain, and then the rugged ground will become level from itself. But if it will be not by the way of nature, let first the "Rugged ground" become level before the ridges go away, and afterwards, "And the ridges will become a plain".

Verse 9

The description here is of Zion herself as the herald, and so too Jerusalem. It says - you Zion the herald go up on a high mountain and you Jerusalem raise your voice with strength, don't be afraid lest the thing which you announce not come to pass, because it certainly will come. Not only this but also say to the cities of Yehudah 'here is your Gd' as if you are pointing to something which has already come and exists. (I already explained in many places that in Zion was the seat of the king, the Sanhedrin and the place of the Holy Temple, while in Jerusalem dwelt the masses. Zion announces that He has returned His Presence to Zion and the kingship and the priesthood. Therefore the prophet advised him to ascend a high mountain. Jerusalem announces the ingathering of the exiles, therefore the prophet advised her to raise her voice in strength in order that those driven away hear and be gathered from the four corners of the heavens.

Verse 16

... "That I may plant the heavens, And lay the foundations of the earth" That is to say that even if one should imagine that the redemption of Zion would be as difficult as the creation of heavens and earth, 'I have put My words in your mouth,' that this too I will do, to plant new heavens and a new earth and to say to Zion 'you are My people.' And this asserts that it is impossible for the laws of heaven and earth and the ways of nature to prevent Me from doing this, because if so I will nullify their laws and establish new heavens, in order that I fulfill My words that I placed in you mouth 'And say unto Zion: ‘Thou art My people.’ Therefore I say this to you.

Verse 17

"Awake, awake" You. In response to what you said to Me, 'Awaken, awaken, dress yourself with strength, O arm of the Lord' (Is.51:9) I say
"Awaken, awaken, arise, Jerusalem" because the thing depends on you

Chapter 52



Verse 1

"Awaken,awaken" (this is also said in response to what is written above, "Awaken, awaken, dress yourself with strength, O arm of the Lord" And He responds - you awake, upon you the thing depends, you dress yourself with strength Zion, as was explained above)
"put on your strength, O Zion" In the stronghold of Zion, the City of David, there resided the Holy Temple,the priesthood, the Sanhedrin and the kingship which are the inner strength - in reference to this the verse says 'put on your strength, O Zion.' But in Jerusalem, which is the wholeness of the city, resided the outer garments - the clothes of glory which are wealth and a populous people and are physical success. In reference to this it says
"put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem the Holy City, for no longer shall there come into you the uncircumcised" into Jerusalem
"and the unclean" into Zion

Verse 11

"Poor one." After the prophet already prophesied that the barren one would have many children, which is an allegory for the ingathering of the exiles, he describes that at that time Zion will still not be rebuilt on her hill. This poor one, who is Zion, will still storm in the rage of her spirit because she still is not comforted. (This was similarly expressed above in chapter 49, "Behold, these shall come from afar... -- And Zion will say, the Lord has abandoned me..." which is similarly expressing that at the time of the ingathering, Zion would yet sit in ruins, as I explained there.) He is saying: 'the barren woman' is already filled with joy, because 'many are the children of the desolate'; but the 'poor one' is still 'storming, still 'not comforted,' i.e., the land is filled with people returned from the exile, yet Zion is still not built. God replies to her: "Behold, I set your floor-stones with puch" -- the stones on which the foundation rests will be Nofech-stones, and the foundation itself will be of Sapir-stones.

Verse 12

Kadkhod is the gemstone called Shoham, according to the Sages. 
Nofech was the tribal gemstone of Yehuda, and is the symbol of kingship; Sapir was the tribal gemstone of Yissachar, and is the symbol of wisdom and of Torah. These two will be the foundation of the building: the crown of Torah and the crown of kingship.
Shoham was the stone of Yosef, and is the symbol of success and wealth. This will be the window for sunshine, symbolizing "the delight of the sun's harvest" (Deuteronomy.33.14), an outpouring of wealth and success.
Ekdach was the stone of Levi, a symbol of the Divine Service. This was the gate: "This is the gateway to Hashem; the righteous shall enter through it." (Psalms.118.20)
"And your entire boundary will be precious stones"; the stones of the remaining tribes will be set into the rest of the building. 
Also included is the idea that all the tribes will be united then, and will never again split into two kingdoms. 
Discord and conflict in a country result from any of four causes, two internal and two external. A. poverty. This he precluded by describing the great wealth and success that would be theirs. B. religious disagreements and sectarian groups based on differences of dogma, as there were during the Second Temple, when the Sadducees and the Boethusians arose. Addressing this, the prophet said:

He will also come to those of Yaakov who turn from sin, to the children of exile who will then repent through the distress which presses down upon them. And if you say ‘how will the people survive until that time, isn’t there still a long wait?’ The next verse replies:

"come bending unto you" The idolaters who oppressed you with hard oppression will come to the point of bending over in order to appease you. And your abusers who did not oppress you but rather only insulted and disparaged you, because you were not worthy of consideration in their eyes (and they will not need to appease you), will bow down at your feet now from the greatness of your importance. And they will call you now
"the city of the Lord" This will be Jerusalem, and the name
"Zion" they will call
"the Zion of the Holy One of Israel" because there Gd will be revealed with the greatest intensity through the pouring out of His holy spirit according to the holiness of Israel and their actions (because this is what divides between Gd and the holiness of Israel in every place):

Chapter 61



Chapter 62



Verse 1

"for Zion's sake" He came back to speak of two matters which he recalled in the previous section. 1. The righteousness which Gd desires to reveal, the righteousness of Israel and the truth of their Torah and their faith. 2. The salvation which Gd desires to bring to them. Zion represents the righteousness of Israel because Zion was the location of the Sanhedrin and the Holy Temple, and Jerusalem represents the salvation of Israel because there the masses dwelt and to there the scattered ones were gathered, as it is written "...put on your strength, O Zion; put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem..." (Is. 52:1) Zion will clothe herself with inner might, the spiritual successes, and Jerusalem external garments - the physical successes. In order to clarify the righteousness of Israel and the truth of their Torah one must argue with words and claims, and on this it says - 
"for Zion's sake I will not hold my peace" I will not cease from arguing and proving her truth. To bring the salvation of Israel out of their exile requires practical action, and on this it says - 
"for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest" I will not sit at ease without doing a thing, rather I will be diligent to save them...
