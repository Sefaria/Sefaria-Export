I chose no city – In Divre HaYamim II 6:5-6 it is written “Since the day that I brought My people forth from the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a House that My name might be therein, neither did I choose a man to be prince over My people Israel. And I chose Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I chose David to be over My people Israel.” The explanation is that the unification of Israel was dependent on two things 1] the unification of the people to become one body. This happened through Jerusalem, as it says “The built-up Jerusalem is like a city that was joined together within itself. There ascended the tribes, the tribes of God, testimony to Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.” (Tehillim 122:3-4) Through all of the tribes going up there on the festival holidays, and everyone facing one place, all the limbs were unified to become one encompassing body. Jerusalem became like a heart to this encompassing body, pumping the spirit of life through it like the heart sends out blood to all the limbs and receives it back as well. 2] Through the kingship of the House of David, which established one eternal leadership that encompassed everyone, as it is written “For there were set thrones for judgment, thrones for the house of David.” (Tehillim 122:5) The kingship of the House of David was to this encompassing body like the brain is to an individual body, which gives sensation, comprehension and guidance to all the limbs. And after this came the Holy Temple, through which the Divine Presence dwelled among Israel in a permanent fashion, which is like the supernal Godly soul known as chaya and yechida which is the connection between God and humanity. The command that the people appoint a king came before the one to build the Chosen House because it is not possible for the Divine soul to dwell in man if it is not preceded by the spirit of life, the intellectual soul, which depends on the body and its unification. The verse is saying that until now the body of Israel was scattered and separated without any unifying force, not the through the life-force which comes from the unification of the people in one city, ‘I chose no city’; and not through the intellectual soul which is general leadership and one kingship, about which it is written “…neither did I choose a man to be prince over My people Israel.” (Divre HaYamim II 6:6) Now they have become one body, whether through the life-force of which it says “And I chose Jerusalem that” whether through the intellectual soul of which it says “and I chose David.” In Divre HaYamim this is spoken out at length, while here in Melachim the verses are more terse, saying ‘I chose no city.’ It was left to be understood perforce that He had not chosen anyone to be a prince, because the choice of the city naturally precedes the choice of the man, just as the life-force precedes the intellectual soul. Here it says ‘but I chose David to be over My people Israel’ because the kingship, which is like the intellectual soul, has been planted within them then all the more so the unity which comes through the city that is like the life force.

The question: This phrase ‘But will God indeed dwell on the earth’ has no explanation because there is no continuity between this and the next verse ‘And You shall turn toward Your servant's prayer.’
But will God indeed dwell on the earth – This is adding another argument to what I said in explanation of Tehillim 89 that the Holy Temple and kingship of the house of David are each causes of one another. Gd chose to rest His Presence on the house which was chosen through the merit of David, and after He chose Zion and established His Presence there He once again exerted His providence to maintain the house of David in the merit of the Temple, as it says “Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place…For the sake of David Your servant…” (Tehillim 132:8-10) This teaches that David’s merit caused the Divine Presence to dwell in the Temple. Then it says further on “…also their sons will sit on your throne forever. For the Lord has chosen Zion…” (Tehillim 132:12-13) which teaches that Gd saw fit to sustain the kingship of the house of David because He had chosen Zion. This is what our verse means – please affirm Your word which You spoke to David because ‘God will indeed dwell on the earth’. From this moment it is real and believable that Gd will have an established dwelling place on earth, and this is dependent on the kingship of the house of David. ...
Behold the heaven – Indeed it must be clear that one should not think that Gd’s established dwelling on earth is as the masses imagine it, that He settles and encamps in a particular place or dwelling. This is a meaningless thought because ‘Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You,’ as He is the place of the world and the world is not His place. All the more so He does not dwell in a house built by the hands of man. Rather His dwelling on the earth is a euphemism for the fact that His providence is fixed there, to hear prayers and attend personally to all of the needs of His people. This is the meaning of the next verses 
“And You shall turn toward Your servant's prayer…That Your eyes may be open…” (Melachim I 8:28-29)

But I shall not tear the entire kingdom away – This will not be because David is your father, because this would only help Shlomo himself. Rather I will do this for the sake of ‘David My servant,’ 
because he was My servant and his throne was like the sun before me.
and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen. As it is written “…also their sons will sit on your throne forever. For the Lord has chosen Zion; He desired it for His habitation.” (Tehillim 132:12-13) Through the choosing of Zion it will be seen that David’s throne will remain there because he built Zion, as I explained in my commentary on Tehillim.

<b>Until when</b> Meaning to say how long will you worship Baal and when things are going bad call out to Hashem in the manner of what is written, "in the time of your evil they will say rise and save us", because you swerve between two ideas and do not know who you worship and this is impossible since there is no middle ground. If Hashem is God there is no substance to Baal [who Hashem commanded us] to cut down and consider disgusting. And if there's no substance to Baal you have no part in Hashem. <b>And they did not answer</b> because the people were satisfied as they were.
