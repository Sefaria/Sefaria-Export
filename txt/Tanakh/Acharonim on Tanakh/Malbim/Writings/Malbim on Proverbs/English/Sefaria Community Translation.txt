Malbim on Proverbs



Chapter 1



Verse 1

Proverbs: In every thing there is substance, form, actor and purpose. Correspondingly, the verse says that the substance of the book is proverbs, which means a grouping of parables; for in order to teach unknown, obscure and profound things, [the author] will create a proverb based on known things. In this way, the hidden, unknown analogue may be glimpsed through the clothing of the parable.<br>The actor is Solomon, son of David, who is given three descriptions. For the truths become known:<br>1. Through wisdom or prophecy, and to convey this it calls him Solomon, who was wise and upon whom the spirit of God rested;<br>2. Through tradition, and to convey this it calls him "son of David," who had a tradition from his forefathers;<br>3. Through discernment and experience, which is perfected by being in the company of many sages, and to convey this it calls him "king of Israel." Since he was king over "this wise and understanding nation," all the sages gathered with him and he had the ability to examine all topics, as it says, "All this I have tried with wisdom."

SHE SENT: for the third time, Wisdom does not summon the guests herself, but by means of HER MAIDS, for wisdom does not come to a man from himself, but it is necessary to receive it from wise men and prophets and teachers. They are the maids that she sends in every generation, and by them SHE CALLS ON THE CITY HEIGHTS to invite guests to the feast.

<b>A wise-hearted one will take commandments:</b> A wise one is one who acts according to the principles of wisdom, as mentioned above. However it is has already been elucidated that the impulse of the heart counters the wisdom. And [so] every man (including a wise one) has a constant war with the impulse of his heart and the desires that move him to the opposite of the way of wisdom. But a man who is already accustomed to the way of wisdom, to the point that it is second nature for him, and the heart - which is the controlling power within him - no longer arouses [him] to evil at all, is called wise-hearted...

Verse 18

<b>He who guards a fig tree will enjoy its fruit, and he who watches his master will be honored:</b> One who wants to eat the fruit of the fig tree needs to guard it (as guarding is greater than watching). For the fruits of the fig tree ripen one by one. So he needs to pick them every morning before the sun shines. For otherwise the fruit that have ripened become wormy, as it is written in the Midrash and in the Yerushalmi. Hence one <b>who watches his master</b> needs to be found with him every morning and pick the fruits, meaning the fruits of his wisdom. This is as it is written about Joshua (Exodus 33:11), "he did not move from being within the tent." And through that he <b>will be honored</b>; he will merit the honor of [his master] placing his hands upon him (to ordain him), as said by the Sages, may their memory be blessed.
