Malbim on Proverbs



Chapter 1



Verse 1

Proverbs: In every thing there is substance, form, actor and purpose. Correspondingly, the verse says that the substance of the book is proverbs, which means a grouping of parables; for in order to teach unknown, obscure and profound things, [the author] will create a proverb based on known things. In this way, the hidden, unknown analogue may be glimpsed through the clothing of the parable.<br>The actor is Solomon, son of David, who is given three descriptions. For the truths become known:<br>1. Through wisdom or prophecy, and to convey this it calls him Solomon, who was wise and upon whom the spirit of God rested;<br>2. Through tradition, and to convey this it calls him "son of David," who had a tradition from his forefathers;<br>3. Through discernment and experience, which is perfected by being in the company of many sages, and to convey this it calls him "king of Israel." Since he was king over "this wise and understanding nation," all the sages gathered with him and he had the ability to examine all topics, as it says, "All this I have tried with wisdom."

SHE SENT: for the third time, Wisdom does not summon the guests herself, but by means of HER MAIDS, for wisdom does not come to a man from himself, but it is necessary to receive it from wise men and prophets and teachers. They are the maids that she sends in every generation, and by them SHE CALLS ON THE CITY HEIGHTS to invite guests to the feast.

<b>A wise-hearted one will take commandments:</b> A wise one is one who acts according to the principles of wisdom, as mentioned above. However it is has already been elucidated that the impulse of the heart counters the wisdom. And [so] every man (including a wise one) has a constant war with the impulse of his heart and the desires that move him to the opposite of the way of wisdom. But a man who is already accustomed to the way of wisdom, to the point that it is second nature for him, and the heart - which is the controlling power within him - no longer arouses [him] to evil at all, is called wise-hearted...

It can also be explained: The <b>wealth</b> of <b>the sages</b> is their <b>crown</b>. That is to say, [their crown is] that which they, through their wisdom, separate from the desires of the world and are happy with their portion, since that is true wealth — one who does not desire [anything], such that he does not lack anything. For the wealthy person who is desirous and his eye will never be satiated (alluding to Ecclesiastes 4:8), he is truly the poor one.

A happy heart will have a good face, the joy of the heart and his sadness will be in several ways, and here the happy heart speaks in the affairs of the world, as a happy heart of all my labors, The joy of the heart is evident on the face, but will not benefit the spirit, that the spirit includes for all the inner powers of the soul a spirit of wisdom and understanding a spirit of knowledge and reverence of God, and sometimes the heart is happy and the spirit mourns, (Good) An afflicted spirit, by being saddened by his mental status, his spirit will be exalted and exalted above, and this is better than a benevolent face,

(17-18) <i>A friend loves at all times, etc. A man who gives the hand is void of understanding</i>: Behold the delineation of <b>a friend is that he loves</b> his friend constantly <i>at all times</i>. And at a time of <i>adversity</i>, his love will grow greater until he is like a <i>brother</i>, to sacrifice his life for his friend as if he were his brother. Nevertheless, even though the friend is obligated to do anything for his friend, he is not obligated to enter <b>into surety and give the hand</b> for him. And if he does this because of his love for him, he is <i>one who is void of understanding</i> and does not foresee the outcome.

Verse 23

“Buy the truth.” Even if you must pay a high price for the truth, such as giving up your desires, childhood pleasures, and what your soul craves—give all this as the price for the truth. “And do not sell.” This means that you should not acquire it like a merchant who buys in order to sell for another price. In other words, you should not learn with the intention of gaining wealth or honor, as this is akin to “buying and selling,” where one receives a different price in return for their acquisition. Therefore, it says, “Buy the truth,” meaning that the essence of truth is to do it for its own sake. The verse clarifies: What should you acquire? What is truth? Wisdom, ethics, and understanding. It has already been explained that wisdom includes the moral laws and customs one must follow according to the Torah. All of these are received (i.e., based on tradition) and are not derived from human intellect. They often contradict one’s natural tendencies, as one’s desires conflict with the laws of wisdom. The soul cannot accept the laws of wisdom except through discipline (mussar), which is rooted in the fear of God—fearing the Lord who observes one and punishes wrongdoing, as He commanded the laws of wisdom. When one restrains their soul with the bonds of fear to not transgress His word, they will also acquire understanding (binah). Understanding refers to the ability to discern between truth and falsehood in matters dependent on intellectual reasoning. However, if one accepts the laws of wisdom along with discipline so that they are firmly established in their heart as truth—through believing in God, who established these laws and knows their reasoning—then one will be able to derive one matter from another and extract conclusions. This is achieved through acquiring truth, which is believing in the laws of wisdom as being true.

Verse 18

<b>He who guards a fig tree will enjoy its fruit, and he who watches his master will be honored:</b> One who wants to eat the fruit of the fig tree needs to guard it (as guarding is greater than watching). For the fruits of the fig tree ripen one by one. So he needs to pick them every morning before the sun shines. For otherwise the fruit that have ripened become wormy, as it is written in the Midrash and in the Yerushalmi. Hence one <b>who watches his master</b> needs to be found with him every morning and pick the fruits, meaning the fruits of his wisdom. This is as it is written about Joshua (Exodus 33:11), "he did not move from being within the tent." And through that he <b>will be honored</b>; he will merit the honor of [his master] placing his hands upon him (to ordain him), as said by the Sages, may their memory be blessed.
