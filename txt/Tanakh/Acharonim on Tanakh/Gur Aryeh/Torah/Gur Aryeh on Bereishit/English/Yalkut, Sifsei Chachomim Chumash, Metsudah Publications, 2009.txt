<b>The great whales.</b> See Rashi in the name of the Aggadah. A species is considered to be in its ideal state only when male and female dwell together. Some creatures, however, are so huge that this world would be unable to bear them. Thus if the Leviasan were to mate the world would be destroyed.

<b>The serpent deceived (</b><b><i>hishi</i></b><b>) me.</b> See Rashi. <i>Hishi</i> cannot be understood here in its usual meaning of “incited” because that would not have been an excuse for sinning.

Verse 15

<b>I will put hostility.</b> See Rashi. The serpent assumed that Chavah would offer the fruit to her husband first, and when she saw that he died she would refrain from eating.

<b>Then men began to call upon the name.</b> This cannot mean that at that time they began calling upon Hashem, because earlier generations had done so as well. For this reason the Sages interpret this statement negatively.

<b>Until the water … dried up.</b> See Rashi in the name of the <i>Midrash</i>. Since the raven is a callous creature it would not have been sent to bring glad tidings to the world. Rather, its real mission was to sustain Eliyahu in the desert so that he could bring famine to the world.

Verse 1



<b>In the groves of Mamrei.</b> See Rashi. He took counsel so that no one could claim that if he had been advised to refrain he would have done so. Alternatively, as allies (see 14:13) they were required to consult with the other before acting.

<b>It would be sacrilege.</b> Although there were no truly righteous individuals in these cities there were some that appeared so. And since Hashem had already brought destruction to the world twice before, people would attribute their deaths to vindictiveness on His part rather than to their own insincerity. <b>To kill the righteous.</b> Their hypocrisy is hinted at in the spelling of the word <i>tzaddikim</i> — “righteous ones” — which is written defective (i.e. missing a <i>yud</i>) throughout this passage.

<b>Magdiel.</b> See Rashi. This name derives from <i>magdil</i> — “magnify,” just as “Rome” derives from <i>romemus</i> — “exaltation.” The next name, Iram, also alludes to Rome and together they correspond to the <i>ir vemigdal</i> (“city and tower”) of the Generation of the Dispersion (see 11:4), which intimates that like that generation, they were destined to be humbled by Hashem.

<b>Ten male donkeys.</b> See Rashi. The donkeys were a hint that in selling him the ten brothers were like mere beasts of burden, fulfilling someone else’s purposes uncomprehendingly. That is, Hashem had used them to bring about this salvation.
