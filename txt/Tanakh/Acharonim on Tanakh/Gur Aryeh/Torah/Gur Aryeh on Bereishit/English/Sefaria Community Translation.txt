Gur Aryeh on Bereishit



Chapter 1



Verse 1

......
"For if they will say..." Now, you may argue that the verse is still problematic; for how does the issue of the giving of the land connected to Torah's mitzvot? This is clear, since most of the Torah's mitzvot  are performed in conjunction with (the Jewish people's sovereignty or dwelling in) the land. Donations, tithes and construction of a temple must be done in the land. When Jewish people do not have the land they cannot fulfill these mitzvot at all.  ...

<b>An expression of sexual immorality and idolatry:</b> Perforce both of them! 'As which of them would you remove?' Hence the verse comes [to allude to] both of them. And that which is written at the end, "and God saw the earth and behold, it was corrupted, since all flesh had corrupted its way," is because the flood came to them through sexual immorality, as Rashi explained (Rashi on Genesis 6:13), "Every place that you find licentiousness, etc." And it appears that the reason only sexual immorality and idolatry are called corruption is because the evil impulse, which incites a person towards evil, is only for these things. As there is an evil impulse for idolatry and there is an evil impulse for sexual immorality, as is found in Tractate Yoma (69b), and in the chapter [entitled] Chelek (Sanhedrin). And they said in several places [that] there are two impulses, the impulse for idolatry and the impulse for sexual immorality. And because specifically these two are called corruption - since it incites to something which is evil, it is corrupt, for something that is evil is corrupt - that is why it is stated (Deuteronomy 4:16), "Lest you become corrupt," about idolatry; and "since all flesh had corrupted," about sexual immorality. This means to say that it followed the evil impulse and became evil. And that is [the meaning of] corruption. Moreover, it is because the Corrupter is the evil impulse; it arises and instigates, then descends and accuses. And therefore these two that have the evil impulse in them, which is the Satan that instigates, are called corruption.

<b>Which do not walk among humans.</b> The meaning of "damaging beasts" (<i>chayyot hamazikin</i>) is such things as the lion, the bear and the leopard. The Re'em says that <i>hamazikin</i>, "damagers," means demons. But this is an error, because here it is written, "with every beast of the earth." Demons are not called <i>chayyot,</i> but rather are in the category of <i>kol chai,</i> "all living things," as it is written (above, Bereishit 6:19 and Rashi ad loc.): "from all the living things." And they are not called <i>chayyot</i>, "beasts."

Verse 21

Spoken of as Samaria - It seems to me that the text hints at the core of the punishments that come through wine, and they are two: the first is the abasement that comes to a person through drunkenness, that they humiliate themselves, and that's why we read "and he uncovered himself in the middle of his tent". The second is the loss of wisdom and intelligence that a person has. And know that intelligence is the connection with the Holy One of Blessing, and through drunkenness this connection will be lost, and when a person has no connection to Hashem - exile and divisiveness come to a person, since whenever a person has his intelligence on, one is called a faithful seed, one is "a tree on a field" (Deut. 20:19), and one's saplings are in heaven, since the head which is the root of the tree/human turns upwards, and this is why a person is called "tree of the field" planted in heaven, and it is through the rational part one is planted in one's place, and all the winds come and blow, but do not move the person from one's place (see Avot 3:17) and when a person goes after getting drunk and one's rational faculties get lost - then one is in exile, and this is what the Torah truly hints with its word "itgal", the writing is "vaitgal" because it comes from the expression of galut, exile.<br>And the words of Rashi are surprising, because our sages in Bereshit Rabbah (Bereshit Rabbah 36:4) did not say that the text hints at the exile of the ten tribes using the word "vaitgal", which is an expression of galut, but using the word "his tent", which I did not find in Bereshit Rabbah. And the rabbis of blessed memory are right, because the Text hints to exile (galut) with the word "vayitgal", since there is no difference between exile (galut) and revealed (galuy), since when one is exiled from one's place comes out from one's hiding place and is seen in another place, and the hint is the exile - that comes from the word revelation that humiliates, and a different revelation - the exile from one;s place, and this thing that maintains the exile of the ten tribes that were exile due to drunkenness, since they separated from the rational part that is the faithful seed, as we explained above. And this is what Bereshit Rabbah says (36:4) - Rabbi Shmuek bar Nachmani says it is not written 'and he revealed' (vaigal) rather 'and he uncovered himself', this thing brought about exile for him and his children. The ten tribes were not only exiled due to wine, etc.' And from the fact that he said 'brought about exile for him'  and what was the exile that it was brought about if not as we said, that he experienced exile from the place of his [high] stanting and level, and so [also] he brought exile to his children. And this is not like Rashi has explained that the Text hints specifically to the ten tribes, since behold he said 'to him and his children' - meaning, all his children, just what was found in the ten tribes, and see.
