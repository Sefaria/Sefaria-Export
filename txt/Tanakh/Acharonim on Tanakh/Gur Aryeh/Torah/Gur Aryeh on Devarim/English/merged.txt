Do not think that it is a combination of your righteousness and the wickedness of the nations. It is due to the wickedness of the nations and the merit of the Forefathers that you are inheriting.

<b>In all of your cities.</b> The court for each tribe was appointed first, and was more important. However in this verse the court of each city is mentioned first because that is where most judgment occurs. The court of the tribe has greater authority in that they can force litigants to appear before them, as Ramban explains, and if the city court is in doubt they come to ask the court of the tribe.

<b>Between blood and blood.</b> It appears that these three matters are mentioned, for they complete a person’s existence. Every man requires personal perfection, and he requires a wife and a livelihood. Therefore the verse states, “between blood and blood” which alludes to relations between a husband and wife; “between decision and decision” which alludes to how one should act with others; and “between leprosy and leprosy” which alludes to how one should act with himself. It is appropriate for the High Court to be involved with these three matters, for the existence of the world depends upon them.

<b>Whichever man.</b> In the first chapter of <i>Sota</i> the Gemara states: 40 days before a child is formed a voice comes out from Heaven and states, “so-and-so will marry this child, such and such a house will belong to this child, such and such a field will belong to this child.” The Gemara lists three things which are the essentials for a person. For this reason the <i>kohein</i> warns specifically about these three things. As long as a person has not completed these three he may not go to battle. The Satan tries to attack at times of danger. Specifically in these three areas which were decreed the Satan challenges, in order to prevent a person reaching his potential. Alternatively, due to not yet having completed these three things a person will become depressed and put himself in danger. However, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yossi HaGalili, this is not considered a time of danger, and there is no need for a person to be afraid. However, he returns from battle in order to protect those who are returning due to sins that they have committed.

Verse 2

The explanation is that he needs to give identifying signs for it. And according to this, "your brother," would be the object, as it is "your brother" that is investigated, that he not be a swindler; and "he/it" refers back to "your brother." And it is like (Exodus 2:6), "When she opened it, she saw him, the child" - wherein the noun comes with its pronoun. Although one is enough, [the noun] comes to add clarification. However it is difficult, as [here] the noun is mentioned before the pronoun - such that if had been written, "until he is investigated, your brother," it would have been fine. But since it is written, "your brother, him," it is difficult - [what is the need for] "him?" So it appears to me that this is the understanding [of Rashi]: But would it ever enter your mind that one could give it back before he inquires about it? But rather investigate him that he is not a swindler - meaning this is why it is written, "until your brother seeks it" - that he is seeking the lost object, and not that he is a swindler seeking to rob his fellow. As that is not seeking the lost object at all. And since it is difficult - how will he know if he is coming to rob his fellow or to seek his lost object, he said, "investigate him to see if he is a swindler or he is not a swindler." And that which Rashi explained, "investigate him," is not the language of the verse - "your brother seek it" - as the verse is certainly like its simple understanding. But rather he came to explain in what way he will know that he is seeking the lost object and is not a robber, about which he said, "investigate him to see if he is a swindler." So does it appear.

<b>You shall not have.</b> Know that Hashem measures exactly what each person needs for their livelihood. Someone cannot take even a hairsbreadth of what belongs to another. When someone lies and cheats with their weights and measures, the enemy comes and enters his border. The Sages state: The prohibition of uneven weights is worse than that of forbidden relations” (Bava Basra 88b) because there is no way of returning money stolen from the public. Furthermore he is lying about something which has a precise measure, and this is worse, therefore the ruler who is the worst punishment comes against him and attacks him.
