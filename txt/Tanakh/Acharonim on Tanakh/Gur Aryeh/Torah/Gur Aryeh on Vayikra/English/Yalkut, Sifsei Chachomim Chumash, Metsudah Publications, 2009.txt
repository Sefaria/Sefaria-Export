Verse 31

<b>And they will not die.</b> There is a difference between ‘being cut off’ and ‘death at the hands of Heaven.’ Death by Heavenly hands means the transgressor alone will die, but ‘being cut off’ means he and his progeny will die. Nevertheless, we find here that the excision of the one who defiles the Mikdash is called death.<br> The explanation for this is that it is also dealing with women, and both a woman and her progeny are not cut off, for the sons will not die because of their mother.<br> Therefore, the main warning here is regarding the death of the transgressor himself.
