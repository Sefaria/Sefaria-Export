... The reason is because of "he who speaks untruth shall not stand before my eyes" (Psalms 101:7). As so long as a priest has not availed himself to him, it is not [legally] a blemish; so could he say, "A blemish has appeared on my house?"

Verse 31

<b>And they will not die.</b> There is a difference between ‘being cut off’ and ‘death at the hands of Heaven.’ Death by Heavenly hands means the transgressor alone will die, but ‘being cut off’ means he and his progeny will die. Nevertheless, we find here that the excision of the one who defiles the Mikdash is called death.<br> The explanation for this is that it is also dealing with women, and both a woman and her progeny are not cut off, for the sons will not die because of their mother.<br> Therefore, the main warning here is regarding the death of the transgressor himself.

Verse 1

... It is difficult... Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah should not have said, "There is a parable about two physicians." Rather, he should have said, "It is a greater warning when someone warns a sick person that he should not die like x, than if he just says not to [do x] and die."...
