<b>These are the heads.</b> The Torah writes this to inform us of the length of the enslavement, for Levi was forty-three when he came to Egypt, and for the remaining ninety-four years of his life there was no enslavement (Levi lived 137 years, v. 16, see <i>Rashi</i> ad loc.). Subtract the 94 years of no enslavement from the 210 years total they sojourned in Egypt, and you conclude that the enslavement lasted 116 years.

<b>For this time.</b> During the first three plagues (דצ''ך—blood, frogs, and lice) Pharaoh did not believe that the plagues came from Hashem and His Providence, because they struck the entire land of Egypt. In the next group (עד''ש—wild animals, pestilence, and rash) Hashem told him He would set apart the land of Goshen, and he perceived the Divine Providence. In the final set (באח''ב—hailstones, locusts, darkness, and the killing of the firstborn) Hashem showed him that He was Unique, for they were exceptionally miraculous plagues. Therefore, Hashem referred to this set all together as, “all my plagues,” especially in reference to the killing of the firstborn.

Verse 1

<b>Then Moshe … sang (literally, “will” or “would sing”).</b> When the righteous are filled with rejoicing, song wells up within them spontaneously. Thus the future tense is used to indicate that as soon as they felt the joy of the miracle it occurred to them to sing, so that they did not sing out of a mere sense of obligation.

This comes to warn about the cherubim, etc. For if not so, why do I need [the phrase] "gods of silver"?  And if you say, why does it interpret "Do not make with Me" as 'Do not make the form of My servants', and we do not interpret "Do not make with Me gods of silver" literally, about the cherubim, that if one altered them to make them of silver, behold, they would be like gods of silver.  and there is to say, if so, why is it written further "Do not make for yourselves", it should have written "Do not make with Me gods of silver and gods of gold", and from the fact that it is further written "Do not make", we learn from here that the beginning of the verse refers to another matter, not to the cherubim. And that which it needed to say 'about the cherubim that you make to stand with Me', even though the word "with Me" written in the verse refers to the servants that serve on high, this is because "gods of silver" is written without a vav, and it should have written 'and gods of silver', rather, by necessity, the word "with Me" in the verse is also connected below, and it wants to say, 'Do not make with Me the form of My servants', also "with Me", which are the cherubim, do not make them of silver. This is how it is in the commentary of the Ra'am. And that which it says further "Do not make for yourselves", it comes to warn not to make cherubim in synagogues, he derives it from the extra "for yourselves" according to this, and not from "Do not make", for if not for "Do not make", I would say the beginning of the verse "Do not make with Me" refers to the servants as mentioned above, rather, he expounds the extra "for yourselves" that they should not make cherubim in synagogues.

<b>He sent the youths [first-born].</b> The first born had not yet been deprived of the privilege of performing the service. And even if Aharon and his offspring were chosen to be the priests before the sin of the Golden Calf (which is not clear), the first born could have served in the capacity of the Levites.
