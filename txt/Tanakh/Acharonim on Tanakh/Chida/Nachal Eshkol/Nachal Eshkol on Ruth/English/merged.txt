Nachal Eshkol on Ruth



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>In the days when the judges judged:</b> The first letters of <i>Vayehi bi’yemei shefot hashoftim</i> spell <i>shuvah,</i> return/repent. All of the prophets prophesied that they people should return to God but they did not turn; therefore, there was a famine in the land. It might also be related to the statement of the sages: At a time when the voice is the voice of Jacob, the hands of Esau have no power.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Gen 27:22, So Jacob drew close to his father Isaac, who felt his arms and wondered out loud, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, yet the hands are the hands of Esau.” Possibly this means that in that generation, the voice of Jacob was muted so the hands of Esau took precedence.</i> It is also taught, “If there is no <i>Torah</i> there is no bread.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Pirkei Avot 3:17</i> There is an allusion to this - the numerical value of <i>Kol Kol</i> is the same as the word <i>raav</i>. famine, 272. When there is neglect of Torah, Esau, the demonic realm rules and there is prosecution from above. Thus, the verse states, “In the days when the judges judge.” <i>Torah</i> decreased and it caused a famine in the land.

Verse 2

<b>Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah</b>: (Rut. 1:2) The verse repeats “Ephraithites of Bethlehem in Judah “ to teach us that the sons of Elimelech were not forced to leave the land of Israel since they were adults and it was within their power to protest or agree. The expression Ephrathites means “important;”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Rut. 1:2</i> therefore, they were caught up in the sin of their father and Scripture states that they left Bethlehem in Judah.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>One named Orpah:</b> (Rut. 1:4) The numerical value of Orpah is <i>nachash</i>, serpent. By including the letters, it equals 358. For from the impurity of jealousy and from the root of the serpent the poison of Goliath went forth. The final letters of <i>shem ha’echat Orpah,</i> spell<i> mitah,</i> death, because the wicked are called dead even while they are alive.
<b>And the name of the second was Ruth:</b> (Rut. 1:4) The disciples of the Ari write “Ruth and Na’amah were “two virtuous fledglings”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Baba Kama 38b, “The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: That which has entered your mind has not entered Mine, because I have two virtuous fledglings [feridot tovot) ], i.e., girls, to extract from them: Ruth the Moabite, who will be the foremother of the dynasty of David, and Naamah the Ammonite, Solomon’s wife, from whom the continuation of that dynasty will emerge. For the sake of these women, the Moabites and Ammonites must not be destroyed.” (Sefaria) Also see Rashi on Numbers 31:2</i> upon which the kingship of Israel was built. Ruth is the mystery of <i>Malchut</i>, and Na’ama is the mystery of <i>Binah.</i> Since <i>Binah,</i> the upper land<i>,</i> is hidden, husks do not have contact with it. It provided Rechabam with enough merit to give birth to a Messiah. But his generation was not worthy, the enlightenment of <i>Malchut</i> was minimal so she revealed slowly so that they were troubled. It was necessary for there to be a great man with vast power (Is, 40:26) who would defeat Israel’s accusers. This person was none other than David, king of Israel, and the sweet singer of Israel, (ll Sam. 23:1) who satiated the blessed Holy One with songs and praises.” From this we may explain what Rechabam said (of his father, Solomon), ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.” (I Ki. 12:10) Anyone who heard this must have been shocked; how could Rechabam portray Solomon with so few virtues? But it makes sense if Rechabam knew the strength of his mother, the mystery of <i>Binah,</i> and that with little merit he could be the progenitor of the Messiah. That is why he said, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.” This comment appears in a slightly different form in what our teacher, the Arizal, wrote in <i>Shaar HaPesukim, Parshat Vayera: “Na’ama</i> is from <i>Binah</i>; she is called <i>Noam Adonai, “</i>The beauty of Adonai,” (Ps. 27:4) Because she comes from the <i>Sephirah</i> of <i>Binah</i> there is very little connection to husks in her, nor were there all the souls. But Ruth is <i>Malchut,</i> the world that is revealed which clings to the many husks in the world that is revealed. All the souls of the house of David until the Messiah were included in her. These two daughters are Ruth And Naama.” This is what he writes in brief.<br>It may be that Rehoboam said, “My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.” (I Ki. 12:10) is because his mother was connected to the <i>Binah</i> so that there is no connection to the husks and she was not in need of clarification since he was just born from her. But Ruth had to give birth to Obed who gave birth to Jesse. King David was despised and hated by his father until Samuel the prophet came, as I have explained in other places…<br>According to what has been said in the statement, “He (Solomon) had a throne placed for the queen mother and she sat on his right,” (I Ki. 2:19) refers to Ruth who was the mother of royalty since all the souls of the kings were included in the house of David.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on I Kings 2:19. Also BT Baba Batra 91b</i> It is quite correct that she was the mother of the monarchy. The first letters of the words <i>V’shem hasheinit Rut,</i> “And the name of the second one was Ruth,” spell <i>Riva</i>, because she satiated the blessed Holy One with songs and praise. That is why Ruth’s name was not changed when she converted since the name hinted at David. Why was she called Ruth because she was the ancestor of King David who satiated the blessed Holy One with songs and praise to God.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>She had heard that <i>Adonai</i> had taken note of His people.</b> The sages said that she had heard this from the merchants who visit the towns. Rabbi Hirsch Darshan of Krakow explains that one cannot contradict merchants (about prices) since they sell women’s jewelry and because they visit all the towns they know the prices of jewelry. They told Naomi that they had traveled throughout the land of Israel so the famine must have stopped…

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>Each of you, to her mother’s house.</b> The first letters of these words <i>Eesha libayt eema</i> spell <i>ele,</i> which is an abbreviation of <i>Ayn avot l’goy, “</i>There are no fathers for gentiles,”<i></i> as the sages say in <i>Midrash</i> on this verse, and as in the story of <i>Nimos HaGardi</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Midrash Ruth 2:13 - Sefaria Translation - “Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law: Go, return each woman to her mother's house [beit immah]” – to the house of her nation [beit ummatah]. The mother of Avnimos the weaver died, and Rabbi Meir ascended to pay his respects and found them sitting in mourning. Later, his father died, and Rabbi Meir ascended to pay his respects and found them engaged in their labor. He said to him: ‘It appears to me that your mother was dearer to you than your father.’ He said to him: ‘But is it not written so: “Each…to her mother’s house”? He said to him: ‘Well said, as there is no paternity among gentiles.’</i>
<b>May Adonai deal kindly with you, (as you did with the dead and with me.)</b> It seems that according to the sages, for gentiles thoughts are not joined to actions. Naomi makes this point when she said, “May God deal kindly with you as you did…” In other words, it specifically speaks of actions and not thoughts. However, the blessed Holy One does not withhold the reward of any being. What then was the purpose of this prayer? It is possible that Naomi’s prayer was beyond their reward - it meant, “May God deal kindly with you beyond the requirements of the law.” You have done more than was required by the law; so may God treat you kindly according to the <i>Torah</i> of kindness.

Verse 16

<b>For wherever you go, I will go; wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God.</b> The sages say in <i>Masechet Yevamot,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Yevamot 47b The passage continues, “Naomi said to her: Four types of capital punishment were handed over to a court with which to punish those who transgress the mitzvot. Ruth responded: “Where you die, I shall die” (Ruth 1:17). Naomi said to her: Two burial grounds were handed over to the court, one for those executed for more severe crimes and another for those executed for less severe crimes. Ruth responded: “And there I shall be buried” (Ruth 1:17).</i> “Naomi said to her: It is prohibited on Shabbat for us to go beyond the Shabbat limit. Ruth said: “Where you go, I shall go,” and no further. Naomi then said: It is forbidden for us to be alone together with a man with whom it is forbidden to engage in relations. Ruth said: “Where you lodge, I shall lodge.” Naomi said: We are commanded to observe 613 commandments. Ruth responded: “Your people are my people.” Naomi said: Idolatrous worship is forbidden to us. Ruth responded: “Your God is my God.”<br>There is a reason for this order. First Naomi mentioned the Sabbath because Israel was commanded regarding the Sabbath before Mount Sinai because the Sabbath teaches us about the Divine, that the blessed Holy One created the world and is the Master of everything - this is the essential teaching. Also the Sabbath teaches us about the special status of Israel; they are the children of the Holy One and are allowed to imitate God’s ways. This is not so for the gentiles who are considered slaves and cannot hold the King’s sceptre. This was an important matter for Ruth; when she converted she would gain the status of a child of God, like the people of Israel.<br>Naomi then mentioned forbidden relations because one cannot use the scepter of the King, as Radbaz<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><b>David ben Solomon ibn (Abi) Zimra</b>: (1479–1573) also called <b>Radbaz</b> (רַדְבָּ"ז) after the initials of his name, was an early Acharon of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries who was a leading posek, rosh yeshiva, chief rabbi, and author of more than 3,000 responsa (halakhic decisions) as well as several scholarly works.</i> wrote in his responsa. Now that they were commanded about the Sabbath and they had the status of “children,” they were still warned about forbidden relations and even regarding a man and woman being alone privately so that they should not say that a child may use the king’s scepter for forbidden relations that are permitted for Israelites. That is to say, that they are on the level of a mortal child but on the level of a slave they must obey God’s decree.<br>From this it goes on to talk about obeying the 613 commandments - they must obey them as servants. The conclusion is a type of beginning - it begins with praise and concludes with idolatry. For our God is the essence and there is no other - so we must observe His commandments. One who transgresses is punished with four types of death penalties as the passage goes on to say. And some would say that the statement, “We are forbidden to worship idols,” is meant to include that even the thought of idolatry is considered like actions. So when Ruth said “Your people are my people,” she accepts the commandments and when she says “Your God is my God,” it is because <i>Adonai Elohei Yisrael</i> has the numerical value of 613.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>When she [Naomi] saw how determined she was to go with her:</b> The final letters of the words<b>, “</b>She was determined to go with her” (<i>hee lechet eeta</i>) spells <i>eeta</i> (אתה) alludes to the fact that Ruth merited to have her body and soul attached with Naomi. Ruth was an aspect of Rachel while Naomi an aspect of Leah, the basis of which is mentioned in<i> Simchat HaRegel.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Another work by the Chida; it is a commentary on the Haggadah and the book of Ruth.</i></i> I will add another gem, with the help of God. <i>Lechet eeta</i> refers to the aspect of Leah, as is written there; that is why the word <i>eeta</i> is hidden (in the final letters). The first letters of these words allude to Leah. Also the word <i>hee,</i> she, alludes to Leah as our teacher of blessed memory wrote… The husks that were with Ruth eventually clinged to Orpa so that Goliath came forth from it. “A man (Goliath) came forward… and he was six cubits and a span tall.” (I Sam. 17:4) The numerical value of <i>zeret</i> (a span) is the same as Ruth when we add the word (607). These husks went to Orpah so that anyone who received it became powerful. It is the aspect of Leah, hovering over Ruth. Therefore it ceased to be with her.

Verse 19

<b>The whole city buzzed with excitement over them. The women said, “Can this be Naomi?”</b>  The gematria of <i>Vatayhom kol ha’ir</i>, “The whole city buzzed,” is the same as <i>Yom katzir omer hayah,</i> “It was the day of the harvesting of barley,” according to Rabbi Moses Galante.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Moshe ben Yonatan Galante (1621 – 1689 Jerusalem), grandson of Moshe Galante, was a 17th-century rabbi at Jerusalem. He served as the first Rishon Le'Zion and was called Magen (מגן) with reference to the initials of his name. He wrote Zebaḥ ha-Shelamim, a harmonization of contradictory Biblical passages and of Biblical with Talmudical statements (edited by his grandson Moses Ḥagis, Amsterdam, 1707–08), and Ḳorban Ḥagigah, halakhic and kabalistic novellæ (Venice, 1714). (Wikipedia)</i> As it says, “Call me Mara,” (Ruth 1:20) The Leket Shmuel<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A midrashic compilation on various subjects with a supplement entitled Derush Shemu’el on the Torah by R. Samuel Feivush ben Joseph Yuzpa Katz. He was a grandson of R. Joshua Falk (Perishah u-Derishah) and served as sofer in Lublin. Samuel was forced to flee that city in 1656 due to pogroms, settling in Vienna, where he was appointed the city scribe.</i> explained that because Naomi did not protest to her husbands and sons (for leaving Beit Lechem), it caused their deaths, Moshe Alsheikh<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Alsheikh, Moses (d. after 1593), rabbi and Bible commentator, born in Adrianople. He studied in Salonika under Joseph *Taitaẓak and Joseph *Caro, and then emigrated to Ereẓ Israel, settling in Safed, where he gained prominence as an halakhic authority, a teacher in two talmudic academies, and a preacher. (Encyclopedia.com)</i> writes that if this is so, then she was guilty of the sin of bloodshed and was judged to be reincarnated as <i>Mara</i> as the holy <i>Zohar</i> states. That is why she says, “Call me Mara.” It might be that this is alluded to when it says, “for Shaddai has made my lot very bitter.” “Made bitter,” <i>Ha’mayr</i> has the same letters as <i>Marah. </i> In other words God would forgive her in the way he embittered her and caused her to be punished bitterly in a place of bitterness. She said, “I went forth full…” It is possible that this alludes to what Rabbi Israel Saruk<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Israel Sarug Ashkenazi</b> (also "Saruk") (16th cent.; fl. 1590–1610) was a pupil of Isaac Luria, and devoted himself at the death of his master to the propagation of the latter's Kabbalistic system, for which he gained many adherents in various parts of Italy. Among these the most prominent were Menahem Azariah da Fano, whom he persuaded to spend large sums of money in the acquisition of Luria's manuscripts, and Aaron Berechiah of Modena, author of the Ma'abar Yabboḳ (Ma'abar Yabboḳ, Ḳorban Ta'anit, i.). (Wikipedia)</i> said. Naomi is connected to the mystery of Leah. The statement, I left full (<i>milai’ah</i>); read it, with a <i>hirik</i> under the <i>mem</i> so it says<i> Me’Leah</i>, (read the verse, “I went forth like Leah”) This is strange, for it says, “But <i>Adonai</i> has sent me back empty,” even though Leah was successful in giving birth to children.

Verse 4

<b>Boaz arrived from Bethlehem. He greeted the reapers, “Adonai be with you!”</b> Boaz was the head of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> and he reached the cross roads. The Tosafot write that because he was meditating <i>Torah</i> and its words were always in his mouth, he began by saying “<i>Adonai</i> be with you.” This was to inform them that he was learning, and, God forbid, that he should mention God without including a word with it. The reapers who were busy with their work prefaced a word (before God’s name); it is written, “They said, “<i>Yivarekhha</i> (Bless you) <i>Adonai.</i>” The author of <i>Torat Hayim</i> on <i>Masechet</i> <i>Hullin</i> writes that one who says<i> Borchu et</i> <i>Adonai</i> mentions two words before God’s name. Why, then, is <i>Baruch Adonai haM'vorach</i> different since there is only one word before God’s name. The answer is the previous person already said<i> Borchu et Adonai.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">So there in fact were at least two words before the response containing God’s name.</i></i> Therefore, it seems that is hinted at when they say, <i>Yivarechecha Adonai</i>, they did so because Boaz already said <i>Eemachem</i> which is connected to <i>Yivarechecha Adonai</i> so that there are two words before <i>Adonai</i>. <i>Yivarechecha Adonai</i> also alludes to the Priestly blessing from which we learn that one should not treat the blessings of a layperson lightly, as the author of <i>Zera Barech<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly the book Zera Berech on the Torah, homilies, by Rabbi Berachia Berech son of Rabbi Yitzchak Izaak [Shapiro] of Krakow.</i></i> writes. Or it might be that we learn that one can make a blessing without conditions.

Verse 5

<b>“Whose girl is that…”</b> The meaning of the question, “Whose girl is that,” is, “Is she fitting to enter the community of Israel?<b>” “The servant in charge of the reapers replied…”</b> This verse repeats, “The servant in charge of the reapers,” though in the first phrase it says,<b></b> “...said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers…”<b></b> It should have said,<b> “He said to him, ‘A Moabite girl…’”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Without the repetition of the whole phrase, “The servant in charge of the reapers.”</i></b> However, it seems that Boaz asked the question in the way one might ask a trusted member of his household, in charge of others. That is why it says, “He said to <b>his</b> servant,” who was in charge of the reapers. And since the servant was sharp and understood Boaz’s intention to marry Ruth, he answered ‘As a servant in charge of the reapers…’ That is, he made himself out to be ordinary, like the other servants standing among the reapers. He then showed his wisdom by speaking the truth, “without anything perverse on his lips,” (Mal. 2:6) or any prejudice attached to himself.

Verse 6

<b>“He replied, “She is a Moabite girl…”</b> “And Your court just came up with a new interpretation of the law, saying that<i> Halachah</i> is that an Israelite woman cannot marry a Moabite man but an Israelite man may marry a Moabite woman.” (Deut. 23:4) Further, this one has the added virtue that she returned with Naomi, the righteous one. Her good deeds are well known and she (Ruth) follows Naomi's good deeds. <b>“She (Ruth) said, ‘Please let me glean…since this morning until now.’” ‘</b>She modestly stood here and did not go back and forth to the little hut.’ When she went out she did not return because she is so modest. She was gleaning wheat because of her wretched poverty so she didn’t come and go.<br>It is also possible to interpret what is written “A Moabite girl who returned from the fields of Moab,” allegorically, as Rabbi Menachem Azaria Mi’Fano<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Menahem Azariah da Fano</b> (also called Immanuel da Fano, and Rema MiPano (1548 – 1620) was an Italian rabbi, Talmudist, and Kabbalist. he was a recognized authority on rabbinic law and the foremost exponent in the West of the kabbalistic system of Moses *Cordovero. Under the influence of Israel *Sarug, who during his stay in Italy spread the knowledge of the mystical system of Isaac *Luria, Menahem Azariah became an admirer of the latter, though without departing from the system of Moses Cordovero. (wikipedia and JE)</i> did: When the<i> Sitra Achra<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Demonic Realm. This term refers to the realm of evil, parallel to the realm of holiness and the Sephirot.</i></i> oppresses the soul at the time of its exit (death), it totally destroys the palace and brings down the building (it destroys body and soul) similar to the war of the kings to save the holy soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Uncertain about what this may mean. Possibly a reference to Abraham saving Lot during the war of the kings in Genesis 14.</i><br>The author of <i>Zera Barekh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Berechiah Berak ben Isaac Eisik Shapira</b> (died 1664) was a Galician preacher who was educated by Nathan Shapira, rabbi of Krakow, and was appointed preacher of that city, where he spent most of his life. He ultimately left for Jerusalem, but died en route at Constantinople .His sermons on the Torah,, the Megillot, and the Passover Haggadah were collected and published in two volumes under the title, Zerah Berak. (Wikiedia)</i> (sec. 3), writes that in honor of Abraham, who saved his brother’s son (Lot), from whom Amon and Moab went forth, they were not entirely destroyed but gave birth to two fledglings (Ruth and Naama). This is what is stated: “She is a Moabite - she is a holy soul who was oppressed by the <i>Sitra Achra</i> - but now she has returned - to holiness through her sacred connection to Naomi. Why was she able to return and the entire palace not destroyed? In answer to this, he says, “From the fields of Moab,” - in honor of Abraham. That which is written,<b> “I have been told of all that you did for your mother-in-law,”</b> (Ruth 2:11) to mean, how you clarified the holiness from Moab.<br>Or else, it can be interpreted based on what the <i>Keli Yakar</i> said: A bride's kind eyes show that she is generous and is the opposite of women who have cruel eyes. Such a soul does not need an inspection. This is what Boaz said, ‘I have been told that you are a generous person,” and through this I know that your entire being is made up of good virtues - based on what you did for your mother-in-law. This shows your wholeness, as is said, Every, “body,” does not need inspection.

He wrote addenda to the Shulchan Aruch for Ashkenazic Jews, better known as the Mappa.</i> has already said in <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> (S, 292:7), if one makes a profit using a deposit, he does not have to give back the profit to the person to whom the pledge belongs.

(Wikipedia)</i> quotes the <i>Shach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Shabbatai</b> <b>ben Meir HaKohen</b> (1621–1662) was a noted 17th century talmudist and halakhist.

(Wikipedia)</i> that he is not obligated to pay the profit to the one he owes the money.<br>How much more so here when we are not speaking of a surety or a debt, for there is no reward for the commandments in this world for all the commandments are of equal importance. The reward is not given until one leaves this world. Then, God in His mercy, repays each person even if his deeds are not complete. In this case there is no debt or surety. How can one claim the principle since it is all considered charity and acts of loving kindness so there is no judgment in the case of a debt or a surety. But God’s kindness is made great and he rewards one’s actions, so that one receives full recompense of the fruits that are born from the planting of commandments.<br>It is about this that Rabbi Chasa has two questions. First, if one plants commandments and fruit come forth and God, in His goodness, gives the one who performs the mitzvot recompense, why did Boaz have to offer a prayer asking for this? And furthermore the verse should have said, “And <i>Adonai</i>, God of Israel, under whose wings you have sought shelter will give you reward for your actions and it shall be full recompense.” To this Rabbi Chasa answers, this is the case from the time of conversion onward, but not the act of conversion itself since Ruth was not an Jew yet. Therefore ,Boaz prayed that the <i>mitzvah</i> of conversion would also be planted for good and that Ruth would be rewarded for the fruit of her conversion and she would profit in the recompense for her act with <i>Adonai</i>, God of Israel, as God did with the people of Israel. And if you ask why do I need a prayer for this (Boaz offers a prayer on behalf of Ruth), “under whose wings you have sought refuge!” That is, Boaz states, “I am speaking about the act of conversion in my prayer.” Rabbi Chasa points this out, by placing his good name before the statement, “Coming under whose wings..”

<b>He handed her roasted grain</b>… “Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: The verse comes to teach that if a person performs a <i>mitzvah</i> he should perform it wholeheartedly. Had Reuben known that the blessed Holy One was writing: “Reuben heard and rescued him (Joseph) from their hands,” (Gen. 37:21) he would have taken his brother to their father on his shoulder. Had Aaron known that the blessed Holy One was dictating in his regard: “Behold, he is coming out to meet you” (Exodus 4:14), Aaron would have emerged to meet Moses with drums and dancing. Had Boaz known that the Holy One blessed be He was dictating in his regard: “He handed her roasted grain, and she ate, was sated, and there was some left over,” he would have fed her fattened calves.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth Rabbah 5:6</i><br>It is possible to explain this statement, by beginning with Rabbi Yaakov Hagiz’s,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Jacob Hagiz</b> (1620–1674) was a Jewish Talmudist born of a Sephardi Jewish family at Fes, Morocco. Ḥagiz's teacher was David Karigal who afterward became his father-in-law. In about 1646, Ḥagiz went to Italy for the purpose of publishing his books, and remained there until after 1656, supporting himself by teaching. Samuel di Pam, rabbi at Livorno, calls himself a pupil of Ḥagiz. About 1657, Ḥagiz left Livorno for Jerusalem, where the Vega brothers of Livorno had founded a beit midrash for him and where he became a member of the rabbinical college. (Wikipedia)</i> explanation in <i>Korban Mincha</i>: (S. 115) “Israel heard. The sons of Jacob were twelve in number.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The full verse states, “While Israel stayed in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine; and Israel found out. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve in number.” (JPS translation)</i> (Gen. 35:22) the sages state in a <i>Midrash</i> on <i>Parshat V’Zot HaBerachah</i> that Jacob had been given the <i>Torah</i> and in this way Reuben was saved because he was exempt for having had relations with his father’s concubine. This is what the verse states, “Israel heard,” that he had the status of an Israelite and therefore, “The sons of Jacob were twelve in number.” If the sons had the status of Noahides, then Reuben would have been put to death for this act and there would not have been twelve sons of Jacob. That is what is stated, “The heritage (<i>morashah</i>) of the congregation of Jacob,” (Deut. 33:4) There was already a heritage or a tradition of betrothal for Jacob and his children that marriage is only finalized through <i>chuppah.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, the concubine was not judged as one of Jacob’s wives according to Jewish law.</i></i> “Then he became King in Jeshurun,” (Deut. 33:5) this refers to Moses who gather all the heads of the people (and officially taught them the laws), “Numerous people is the glory of a king,” (Prov. 14:28) This is the reason for the statement, “May Reuben live and not die,” (Deut. 35:6) Because Rebuen was judged as a Israelite, he did not die as a Noahide. This is the essence of his explanation in short.<br>In my youth I wrote a treatise calle<i>d Rosh David</i> (P. 36) containing the opinion of Rabbi Chagiz, expressed in the introduction of <i>Parashat Derachim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A work containing twenty-six homiletic treatises on various subjects, by Rabbi Yehuda Rosanes. He (1657-1727) was a Rabbi of Constantinople. On account of his knowledge of Arabic and Turkish he was appointed by the government as chief rabbi of the Ottoman empire. He took a very active part in condemning and denouncing the Shabbethaians, and was one of the signers of an appeal to the German communities to oppose the movement. This work and others were edited & published by his devoted pupil Rabbi Yaakov Culi, author of Meam Loez. (https://seforimcenter.com)</i><i></i> I explained all of these verses there but I never found the <i>Midrash</i> on<i> V’Zot HaBerachah</i> that Rabbi Hagiz mentions. However, what was written on, “The heritage of the congregation of Jacob,” was explained there. And according to this one can explain, “O offspring of Israel, His servant;”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">offspring of Israel, His servant, O descendants of Jacob, His chosen ones.</i> (I Chron. 16:13) Israel - our forefather Jacob - received Torah and passed it onto his children so that Reuben was not guilty of sin and there would still be the 12 sons of Jacob. Some have written in homilies that Joseph the righteous assumed that they had the status of Noahides as the author of <i>Parashat Derachim</i> and others wrote. If this were so then Reuben would have been deserving of he death penalty (God Forbid!).<br>While it was Reuben’s righteous intention to save Joseph, he didn’t try hard enough, because he was afraid that he would find out that the law was according to Joseph and that they had the status of a Noahides. If he saved Joseph he might have brought evil upon himself. If he had known, however, that God would write that he would save Joseph from the brothers, in other words, similar to what the <i>Torah</i> states, “He tried to save him from them,” (Gen 37:21) and also, “Intending to save him from them in order to return him to his father.” (Gen. 37:22) (he might have acted differently.) His only intention was to bring Joseph back. This is what the Holy One wrote about him and it proves that he had the status of an Israelite for whom good intentions are joined to actions.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Kiddushin 40a: “The Holy One, Blessed be He, links a good thought to an action, as it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with the other, and the Lord listened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that fear the Lord, and that think upon His name” (Mal. 3:16). The Gemara explains: What is the meaning of the phrase “and that think upon His name”? Rav Asi said: Even if a person intended to perform a mitzvah but due to circumstances beyond his control he did not perform it, the verse ascribes him credit as if he performed the mitzvah, as he is among those that think upon His name.” This however only applies to Jews and not non-Jews.</i> If, however, Reuven was considered a Noahide, then good intentions would not be joined to his actions. Since the blessed Holy One wrote that he had the status of Israelites, he had no fear that they would say that he had the status of a Noahide as Joseph claimed, and that he was guilty (of having relations with his father’s concubine). Then he would have carried Joseph on his shoulders back to Jacob even though Joseph thought the law was different. Still, Reuben saved him because he knew that one who saves an Israelite is as if he saved the whole world. And that is why one who performs a commandment should do so with a whole heart and not worry about suspicions or other matters. And we have heard about Reuben with whom damage would have resulted had he acted on his thoughts when they (the brothers) sold Joseph resulting in a step between him and death, and all the other events that would have come to pass. One might conclude that Reuben should have acted on his good intentions and not worried about those who disagreed.<br>But what if one’s action will not lead to such damages; should one worry about “the scorn of the complacent?” (Ps. 123:4) The <i>Midrash</i> brings proof to show that a person should still perform <i>mitzvot</i> with a wholeheart even if there is no danger of damage as in the case of Aaron. It is possible that Aaron thought that Israelites were considered Noahides when he saw what his father, Amram, did. Amram was one of the righteous people of his generation. He was one of four who died due to Adam’s sin with the serpent (and not because of his own sin).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">BT Shabbat 55b</i> He married his own aunt, Yocheved. According to <i>Targum Yonatan</i> when he divorced her she married Elitzafan ben Parnach but in the end, he remarried her and they gave birth to Moses. All of these acts would later be forbidden by <i>Torah</i> law.<i></i> As a result, Aaron concluded that the Israelites had the status of Noahides until they received the <i>Torah.</i> Amram could take his aunt as a wife, divorce her and then take her back as a wife because the <i>Torah</i> had not yet been given. However, in order not to cause the scorn of the masses, Aaron didn’t want to go out to meet his brother with “drums and dance” which would have given the people an excuse to talk about his family or Moses. That is why he went out to greet Moses privately. Even though there was no danger or suffering involved in this matter, he thought that it was better to worry about scorn of the people. Thus we learn that even in this situation, it is better to perform the commandment with a full heart... If Aaron had known that God would write, “he (Aaron) will be happy in his heart to see you.” (Ex. 4:14) he would have known that they had the status of Israelites and his analysis was incorrect. Amram had acted according to the word of God, as the <i>Zohar</i> comments on the verse, “A man from the house of Levi…” (Ex. 2:1), then Aaron would have gone forth with timbrels and dancing (when meeting his brother), to fulfill the commandment properly.<br>Further we also learn this lesson from Boaz. It occurred to Boaz and he saw through the Holy Spirit that he would marry Ruth. Further Ruth said, “Why are you so kind as to single me out, when I am a foreigner?” (Ruth 2:10) The sages comment, “To single me out,” in the way of all the earth. Boaz only gave her a little grain because he was fearful that people would say that he didn’t do so for the sake of a commandment but rather out of desire for her and in order to marry her. If Boaz had known that God would write about him, “He handed her roasted grain, and she ate her fill and had some left over,” so that it appeared as of he gave her a extra in order to satisfy her hunger, when in fact he gave her just a little bit but it was blessed, as the sage explain. But the blessed Holy One wrote that he gave her enough for her satisfaction. But if he really valued the <i>mitzvah</i> he would have given her fatted chickens! Further it states the details; it states that he said to her”“Come over here and partake of the meal, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.” and afterwards it states that he gave her roasted grains, all as part of a single commandment to feed her. Had Boaz known how important this <i>mitzvah</i> was, he would have fed her fatted chickens.

Verse 15

<b>Boaz gave orders to his servants (</b><i>ni’arim</i><b>) , saying (</b><i>leimor</i><b>), “You are not only to let her glean among the sheaves, without interference…</b> At first glance the word <i>leimor,</i> “Saying,” needs an explanation. The statement, “his servants” refers to one “who is in charge of the reapers,” (Ruth 2:5) whose job it was to make sure the workers acted properly according to the law. Among the servants there was one who was superior to rest. He is the one to whom Boaz spoke when it says, “to his servants who was in charge of the gleaners.” There were other workers with the gleaners and the poor.<br>Another interpretation: Later, it states, “in the field,” … his worker who was placed in charge of the gleaners. Now, when Boaz came from <i>Beit Lechem</i> he had a servant or two with him, as an important individual often has. To these servants and to the workers who were mentioned, he directed his comments when he said, “Boaz commanded his servants.”.(Ruth 2:15) . That is why it says, <i>leimor;</i> he said that the servants should say to the other gleaners, “You are not only to let her glean among the sheaves, without interference…” and he said to them, “Do not scold her.” It might be that because there were many poor people there as well as the gleaners themselves, when these people saw the servants showing great kindness to Ruth they suspected that they were doing it because of her great beauty, to get close to her. Because the servants feared God, they might scold her to show that they weren’t showing her favoritism but because they were so commanded. Rather she was in their eyes, a stumbling block. Therefore he said, “Do not scold her” lest damage result and she would not glean there.<br>Another interpretation: Because she is a princess and she is converting. Therefore it is not fitting to speak harshly to her for we are commanded to not to oppress the convert; how much more so when she is the daughter of the king!

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>So she told her mother-in-law whom she had worked with, saying, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.”</b> We need to understand this verse. On the face of it, the expression, “Saying, “The name of the man…” would appear to be repetitive, since it was already written, “She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked.” From this phrase it is clear that we know who the man was, and certainly that Ruth had already told Noami. Further, the expression <i>v’tageid</i>, “She told,” implies a matter of insight/wisdom and after- wards it states, “Saying, the name of the man...” However, the sages say that this man was actually Ibtzan<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See Judges 12:8, Note that Ibtzan was also from Beit Lechem though it is not clear that it was the same city. “After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.”</i> but here he is called Boaz because he had strength in his reverence for God (<i>oz biyirah</i>).<br>When Naomi asked where did you glean, Ruth should have replied, “In the field of Boaz.” But it was Ruth’s intention to tell her that Boaz acted with amazing kindness, besides letting her glean in his field. Therefore she answered Naomi, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.” Scripture prefaces her statement by saying that she answered with words of wisdom, “She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked. The word <i>vi’taged</i> expresses words of wisdom/insight, as the <i>Zohar</i> states. This verse comes to arouse, and to illuminate her words. After this she told Naomi the name of the person, “The name of the man with whom I worked ...’” Naomi hinted to Ruth that he made a special effort because he was interested in her but she should refuse him and save him from sin. To this Ruth said, “The name of the man with whom I worked was Boaz.” In other words, my intention was on his kindness and on nothing else for his name is Boaz - One in whom there is reverence for God.<br>The sages saud in the <i>Midrash</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabba 34:8

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, “Daughter, I must seek a home for you.</b> The commentators explain that while a mother seeks to find another husband for her daughter who has been widowed, it is grievous to a mother-in-law to see her daughter-in- law married to another man in place of her son. When, “Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to Ruth, “My daughter,” she was saying, ‘I am treating you as if you were my own daughter whose husband died and who now seeks to marry to another. So shall I do for you though I am only your mother-in-law.<br>Some say that, ‘My daughter,’ alludes to what the Kabbalists said: Naomi is the mystery of Leah and Ruth cleaved to her in order to receive the lights of Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In the Sephirotic system, Leah is associated with the Sephirah of Binah and Rachel with the Sephirah of Malchut. Because Malchut “has no light of its own” and receives its light from above and from Binah in particular, Ruth, who is associated with Rachel/Malchut cleaves to Leah/Binah.</i> This is hinted at in the words, <i>biti halo</i>, “My daughter, must I not…” The letters of the word <i>halo</i>, “Must I not…” are the same letters that make up the name of Leah. Since you take from me the aspect of Leah, so you are my daughter.

Verse 3

<b>So wash, anoint yourself, dress up… Do not disclose yourself to the man:</b> The <i>Midrash<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth Rabbah 5:12</i></i> explains, “wash” away the taint of idolatry “and anoint yourself,” with <i>mitzvot</i> & acts of righteousness<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Tzedakah is often translated as charity.</i>, “And dress up,” in <i>Shabbat</i> clothing<i>.</i> The <i>Rishonim<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The early decisors of Jewish law, who lived before the Shulchan Aruch.</i></i> explain that this verse is difficult since it doesn’t say “Take off your garments,” before, “Wash and anoint yourself,” And it is unnecessary to say “Wash and anoint yourself.” Also it didn’t need to say dress up; since this was obvious; she was not about to remain naked. The <i>Midrash</i> explains that “dress up” refers to Sabbath clothing. This might be explained according to the <i>Yalkut Reuveni, Parshat Vayeshev</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">By Rabbi Yaakov Reuven Hakohen Sofer Written in the 1700's, this vast compendium of Midrashim is derived from the nigleh level(the oral tradition contained mainly in the Talmud) and nistar level(the esoteric tradition of Kabbalistic writings).

The first extant edition was published in the city of Korzec in Poland in 1784. Aegidius of Viterbo, a 15th-century cardinal, was influenced by Sefer HaTemunah, as can be seen in his writings Shekhinah and On the Hebrew Letters</i></i> Ruth had a Jewish soul and she carried the sin of the first human being. She was meant to be partnered with Boaz. This soul was now ready to become holy by marrying Boaz, head of the Sanhedrin. So Naomi told her, “Wash away” the taint of idolatry. That is, “Your soul is already Jewish and you deserve to convert. Only your body is still tainted through its association with idolatry. Therefore, you must purify it so your body and soul will arise from the washing filled with the light of the <i>mitzvot</i> and acts of charity that you performed. When the sin has been repaired, you can put on the cloak of commandments, the garments of the sages. This is alluded by the garments of<i> Shabbat</i>, the spiritual garments that are fitting for a world that is all Sabbath.<br>After all this praise, “When you go down to the threshing floor;” (Ruth 3:4) (it literally says) “My merit will go down with you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi Ruth 3:3-4</i> What does it mean when it says<b>,</b> “Do not disclose yourself to the man?” This can be explained by what the sages said about a verse in <i>Shocher Tov,</i> “I rise at midnight to praise You;” (Ps. 119:62) David said, “I will give thanks for what You did for my grandmother, Ruth, at midnight when Boaz did not curse her.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth Rabbah 6:1 - “The trembling that Ruth induced in Boaz, as it is stated: “The man trembled and flinched” (Ruth 3:8), and by right, he should have cursed her. “But, one who trusts in the Lord will be exalted” – You inspired him to bless her, as it is stated: “Blessed are you of the Lord, my daughter.”</i> It is written, “When you go down…” The sages commented, Her merit <sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As Rashi understands this verse.

The statement, “Do not disclose (<i>Al Tivad’</i>i) yourself to the man,” comes from the expression, “and he punished (<i>vayoda</i>) the people of Succoth with them.” (Judg. 8:16) In other words, do not be chastened because Boaz will not curse or punish you. It is because of the merit of this great woman, Naomi, that you have come.<br>Another interpretation: Ruth was protected so she was not cursed or accused by Boaz for startling him or acting strangely.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth Rabbah 6:1</i> That is, the merit of King David benefited Ruth, because in the future he would rise nightly to offer praise and prayer… this is hinted at in what the sages said: Why did Ruth merit to be the progenitor of King David? Because he would satiate God with songs and praises. Ruth’s name did not change when she converted and after miracles and wonders were performed for her because King David would be born through her line. Her name hinted that she avoided Boaz’s punishment and that she was not burned by his anger. Boaz did not curse or condemn her through the merit of King David, of blessed memory, who was born of her lineage. Through his merit, King David protected her. In place of a curse from Boaz gave her a blessing…in place of lying at his feet she resided in his soul and became his wife. That is why she was called Ruth, alluding to the fact that King David would satiate (<i>riva</i>) the blessed Holy One in the middle of night and atone for what she did at midnight.<br>Continuing with this, we can now understand the statement in l Chronicles 4:21-22, “And the families of the linen factory at Beth-ashbea; and Jokim, and the men of Cozeba and Joash, and Saraph, who married in Moab and Jashubi Lehem.” I will explain these verses in a new way (see <i>Simchat HaRegel</i>). It would seem that what was written there was doubted by the author of <i>Mutzal M’eish</i>. He asks, if one had intimate relations with a married woman with intention to sin while her husband was overseas, and then it became known that her husband had already died, is it now permissible for the couple to marry? In my youth, I argued that it was permitted. A similar doubt arose with regard to Mahlon and Kilyon. They intended to have forbidden relations and they presumed that a Moabite woman was forbidden but actually this relationship was permitted. It would appear that they did not transgress a prohibition. However, the author of the <i>Siftei Kohen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Shabbatai</b> <b>ben Meir HaKohen</b> (1621–1662) was a noted 17th century talmudist and halakhist.

Such a relation was prohibited to Mahlon, Kilyon, and “And the families of the linen factory (<i>beit avodat habutz</i>) at Beth-ashbea…” That is, it refers to King David who worked on the curtain of the ark, as the <i>Yalkut</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Actually, the citation appears in Ruth Rabbah 2:2 and not in the Yalkut: Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani interpreted the verses as referring to David: “The sons of Shela, son of Judah: Er, father of [avi] Lekha” (I Chronicles 4:21) – the President of the Court [Av Beit Din] of Lekha. “And Lada, father of [avi] Maresha” (I Chronicles 4:21) – the President of the Court [Av Beit Din] of Maresha. “And the families of the house of those who wrought fine linen,” – this is David, who was engaged [in preparing] the Tabernacle curtain…</i> wrote on this verse.

He lied by saying that if a Moabite is permitted, then why should Mahlon and Kilyon be found guilty - they were permitted to marry Moabite and Ammonites just as the author of <i>Mutzal Mei’eish</i> said. “Joash, and Saraph, who married into Moab.” (l Chr. 4:22) They married Moabite women who were forbidden just like Moabite men. “Who were married into Moab,” they had relations for until Boaz the Moabite women were forbidden until “<i>Yashubi Lehem</i>,” (l Chr. 4:22), that is until Ruth cleaved to <i>Beit Lechem</i> and married Boaz in <i>Beit Lechem Yehuda</i>. He was the holy spark that returned to us, as the sages said. But until that time the women of Moab were forbidden. Look carefully!

Verse 5

<b>“I will do everything you tell me.”</b> This alludes to what the holy Rabbi Shimshon of Ostropoli<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Samson ben Pesah Ostropoli</b> (died July 15, 1648), was a Polish rabbi from Ostropol who was martyred at Polonnoye, Volhynia, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising.

Ostropoli was a noted kabbalist. He was the author of a commentary on the kabalistic work Ḳarnayim.

It was with Ruth who carried the aspect of Rachel and received divine abundance from Naomi, the aspect of Leah, giving her the strength to lessen this husk - Leah-Rachel.

Verse 9

<b>“I am your handmaid, Ruth. Spread your robe over your handmaid, for you are a redeeming kinsman.”</b> This might explain what the sages said<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth Rabbah 5:2</i> about the verse, “Why are you so kind as to single me out, [<i>lehakireni</i>] when I am a foreigner? (Ruth 2:10),” it teaches that it was revealed to Boaz through the Holy Spirit that He was destined to marry and have relations with her [<i>lehakirah</i>] in the way of the world. Also, adjacent to this we wrote in the name of <i>Sefer Temunot</i> that Ruth had a Jewish soul and that she was destined to be Boaz’s soulmate. That is why her name was not changed like other converts. This was because Naomi and other holy people knew that her soul was a Jewish soul. When she said, “I am Ruth, your handmaid,” it was already known that her soul was called by this name. The name was part of her essence and not connected to her physical being. It referred to all the aspects and part of her soul, its place in the world and its qualities as has been said in other places in the name of the holy <i>Zohar</i> and by the Ari, of blessed memory. This is what the <i>Rishonim<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See footnote 41</i></i> wrote regarding the verse, “Let Aaron be gathered to his kin,” - that is, his soul.”<br>When she says, “I am Ruth,” she is saying, “My name has not changed because my essence is Ruth and I have a Jewish soul.. My name alludes to the roots and part of my soul all of which are attached above. Further, I am, “Your handmaid,” I am your partner. “Spread your robe over your handmaid,” spread the robe of marriage over your handmaid. And if you say, “You killed Mahlon and Chilyon; for according to some after being married to Mahlon, Ruth was married to Chilyon. Perhaps you think I am a murderer!” This is not so for I was meant to be your soulmate, and that is why they died! I was created for you! The statement continues, “For you are a redeeming kinsman,” If you don’t redeem me, no one will for I am your soulmate. The numerical value of the first letters of, “Spread your robe…” is 26, the same as the name of God, for a man and a woman who are worthy marry, the divine presence dwells with them. Furthermore, the first letters of “Your robe over your handmaid,” (כנפך על אמתך) has the numerical value of <i>YHWH Adonai,</i> when they are united, is 91; when the couple is united by <i>chuppah, kiddushin</i> and the seven marriage blessing.

Verse 10

<b>Your latest deed of kindness is greater than the first:</b> The point of the expression, “You latest deed of kindness is greater,” is that you performed with your very soul, as it says, “A kind soul benefits himself,” (Prov. 11:17) This latest act of kindness is even greater than your first acts for you shown that there is conversion for the sake of heaven without any conditions. You have shown that you did not follow the other men and that all your deeds are for the sake of God.

Verse 11

<b>“For all the elders in the gates know what a fine woman you are.”</b> “The elders in the gates,” is an allusion to the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, who recognized Ruth’s virtues despite the fact that they thought that Moabite women were forbidden in marriage. Now they see that because of you God has opened their eyes and we now know that the Torah applies to Ammonite men and not women as well as Moabite men and not women. They did not change this law more than two days before you came because they recognized the truth. Their eyes were opened and they knew what a fine woman you are and because of your great importance the law was revealed in your honor!<br>Mahlon and Chilyon were prevented from you because of their sins which have not been revealed even to you. But with their death what was closed was opened; until now Moabite women were forbidden to marry Israelite men, according to the <i>Shach</i>, as stated above. It is also possible according to <i>Mahari</i> on the <i>Haftorah</i> for <i>Parshat Chukkat</i> when he said to her that she was a recipient of luck (good and bad)<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Baalat Mazal can be taken either as a lucky person or an unlucky person. She was simply a recipient of luck just like the rest of us.</i>. And the statement that she was, “A fine woman,” see what he wrote there according to his approach.<br>Regarding the prohibition of marriage to a woman who has lost two husband, due to her being “a murderer.” She simply has no luck in marriage, as is said in the <i>Talmud.</i> The Rosh writes in a responsa that if a man has two wives pass away one should not call him “a murderer” and that he can not marry. So too, with a woman. This is caused by luck, and if she doesn’t marry she will not have food, while a man can always earn a living so he has “<i>Mazal</i>.” Since she said, “Spread your robe over me for you are a redeemer,” I wrote in my poor youth that Ruth was not considered a murderer since it is caused by bad luck and not by Ruth. She is the recipient of luck (good and bad). Mahlon and Chilyon died because of their own sins.

Verse 12

<b>But while it is true I am a redeeming kinsman…</b> <br>Instead of saying <b><i>Amnam ki (im)<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">While the word im appears in the text it is not read as part of the text. Instead it is read amnam ki…. The expression Ki im expresses doubt about who the redeemer is supposed to be or even if there was a redeemer and there most certainly was a redeemer.</i></b> goel anochi, “<b></i></b>While I am the redeeming kinsman…” it should have been written <b><i>Ki im</b> goel anochi, <b></i></b>“Even though I may be the redeeming kinsman.”<i> Amnam ki</i> is meant to hint that Boaz certainly was the redeeming kinsman and there is no real doubt. The question about whether there was a redeeming kinsman is not in doubt at all. Therefore the word im is written but it is not read. When Boaz spoke with her his words implied, you may think there is a doubt but the majority of people know that there is a redeemer who will do so. Boaz, however, knew that he would certainly marry her.

Verse 13

<b>“As Adonai lives! Lie down until morning.”</b> The first letters of the expression, <i>shichvi ad haboker, “</i>Lie down until the morning<i>,”</i> spells <i>sha’ah</i> (hour)<i>.</i> That is, at this exact hour. The word <i>sha’a</i>h has the same numerical value as <i>shleimah,</i> perfect/whole,<i></i> because a perfect child shall come forth from you. This is similar to the way Boaz prayed when he said, “May you have complete (<i>shleimah</i>) recompense,” (Ruth 2:12) because a <i>shlomo</i>, a complete child, shall go forth from you, as is said in <i>Midrash Rabbati</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See Pesikta D’Rav Kahanah 16:1</i>

Verse 14

<b>She rose before (<i>biterem</i>) one person could distinguish another…</b> The sages comment in the Midrash<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth Rabbah 7:1</i>: “Before [<i>beterem</i>] one could distinguish” — <i>beterom</i> [with a <i>vav</i>] is written, teaching that she stayed there six hours, corresponding to the numerical value of <i>vav</i>. Besides the statement of the sages, there are those who say that the extra <i>vav</i> is a hint that it was because of King David who in the future would rise up every night at the sixth hour before the day began. In this way he helped his neighbor recognize that God joins the blessed Holy One and the <i>Shechina</i> in a primordial coupling, as is explained in the <i>Holy Zohar</i> in the rising up at Midnight. Because of it Ruth was saved and was not punished and she was given life as is hinted by the letter <i>vav</i> which is a sign of life. The Holy <i>Zohar<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar 2:2a<br>- שְׁאַל לְךָ אוֹת, אוֹת מַמָּשׁ. דְּכֻלְּהוּ הֲווֹ נַטְלִין בְּרָזָא דְּאַתְוָון. וְכֵן בְּרָחָב מַה כְּתִיב, (יהושע ב׳:י״ב-י״ג) וּנְתַתֶּם לִי אוֹת אֱמֶת, דָּא אָת ו', דְּדָא אִקְרֵי אוֹת אֱמֶת. וְאִי תֵּימָא שְׁאָר אַתְוָון לָאו אִינּוּן אֱמֶת. אִין, אֶלָּא אוֹת דָּא אוֹת אֱמֶת אִקְרֵי.</i></i> states when explaining the verse, “Provide me with a reliable sign.” (Josh. 2:12) According to the sages this is an allusion to the six hours that she tarried there, so that, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.” (Ruth 2:14) In the <i>Midrash,</i> the sages explained that all that night Boaz prostrated himself and prayed that it should not be known that a woman had come to the threshing floor, lest it be a desecration of God’s name, God forbid. It was through the merit of the six hours that Boaz controlled his inclination that it was God’s will that it not be known that there was a woman in the threshing floor.

Verse 15

<b>He measured out six measures of barley (<i>se’orim</i>), and he put it on her back.</b> In this way the blessed Holy One repaid Ruth measure for measure. It was for the merit of King David, of blessed memory, who would rise at midnight and cause a heavenly coupling that God caused a goodly coupling of Ruth and Boaz.It was also a reward for her acceptance of the 613 commandments and the seven rabbinic commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah empowers and charges the Rabbis with the responsibility to create “fences'' to protect the Torah, and we are likewise charged with the obligation to follow their instructions. Accordingly, we find countless examples of Rabbinic decrees mentioned in the Talmud. Based on the above verse the Rabbis were given license to create Rabbinic mitzvot as well. These mitzvot are: Hallel, Purim, Chanuka, washing the hands (before eating bread), lighting Shabbat candles, and saying blessings (such as when eating food, and more) — seven in total. See https://ohr.edu/this_week/the_anatomy_of_a_mitzvah/7768</i> Together they have the same number as the word <i>se’orim</i> - equals 620. “He measured out,” God had compassion on Ruth according to the qualities of King David and rewarded her measure for measure. Six were for the sixth hour when King David arose and also <i>se’orim</i> was for the 620 commandments that she accepted. “He laid it upon her,” (Ruth 3:15) so she could carry the commandments. And in this way, “She went back to the town,” she merited to partner with the law of Boaz’s people, coming to the city. This fits with what she did, “He measured out six measures of barley and he placed it upon her…” This fits with the allusion I made in <i>Simchat HaRegel</i> (P. 33a) - see what is stated there. Also if we break down the word <i>Se’orim</i> שערים the first letters - <i>shin ayin</i> are equal to 370 lights of our forefather Abraham. The<i> reish</i> alludes to <i>Reishit Chochma</i>, the beginning of wisdom to which the <i>Zohar</i> alludes as well as other places. <i>Yud mem</i> is an allusion to the fifty gates of understanding (<i>binah)</i>.

Verse 16

<b>She told her all that the man had done for her.</b> When Naomi asked, “How is it with you, daughter?” the sages said she was asking, “Are you still single or are you a married woman?” To this, she wisely answered and told (<i>v’taged</i>) her… The verb<i> haggadah (taged)</i> is only answering wisely. What was the wsideom? She told her and said how much he did for me. That is, first, he was described as “(the man) whom she had worked,” when Ruth was poor and she had worked for the householder. But now, this was not how he was described because she was nearly married to Boaz and she was no longer in the category of a needy person. Ruth then said, “She told her all that the man had done for her,” speaking of all his acts of kindness. Now she could truthfully speak of what he did for her because he promised to marry her. According to its plain meaning it might hint that he followed her home from his field to the house of Naomi as the sages<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">See Ruth Rabbah 7:3</i> comment on the verse, “He (She) got back to the town.” (Ruth 3:15)

<b>…Lest I impair my own estate.</b> The sages say in the <i>Midrash</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth Rabbah 7:7 The first redeemer is called ploni almoni, simply an anonymous person. Based on the second word, almoni, Rabbi Shmuel understands it as Ilaim, mute or unknowing.</i> “Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He was mute [<i>ilem</i>] from matters of Torah. He said,<i> ‘</i>The first ones, Maḥlon and Kilyon, died because they took her, because they married Orpah and Ruth, and should I take her? Heaven forbid that I take her, I do not want to taint my children, I do not want to mix dross with my children.’ But he did not know that the <i>halachah</i> had already been changed: “An Ammonite,” but not an Ammonite woman, “a Moabite,” but not a Moabite woman.” But one could ask, why didn’t Boaz and the others who sat in the gate fulfill the commandment, “Speak up for the dumb,” (Pro. 31:7) by telling him, “Don’t you know that the <i>halachah</i> has already been introduced that she is permitted?” It might be that after this they said to him that a ruling and <i>halachah</i> has been disseminated that the law applies to a Moabite man and not Moabite women. But since he knew so little <i>Torah,</i> he was still in doubt. How could this law be hidden from all the leaders of Israel…therefore he suspected that maybe that erred. That is why he said, “Lest I impair my own estate,” in the language of doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">A better translation might be as (“I might impair…”)</i>

Verse 7

<b>Now this was formerly done in Israel.</b> It is stated in the book <i>Likutei Torah</i> (manuscript), ““<b>Now this;</b>” the word <i>zot,</i> this, refers to <i>Torah.</i> “<b>Was formerly done in Israel</b>,” specifically in Israel and not by the other nations. “<b>In cases of redemption</b>;” that is, in the book of the prophets. “<b>Or exchange</b>;” the Babylonian <i>Talmud</i> which mixed up the language. “<b>And this was the practice in Israel</b>;” this is the Jerusalem <i>Talmud.</i> “<b>To confirm all things</b>;” as if there were three knots. “<b>One man would take off his sandal</b>;” refers to Esau who is called a man of the field. <b>“And he gave it to the other</b>;” The word <i>Na’alah</i> is connected with <i>La’anah,</i> “Wormwood and poison weed.” (Deut. 29:17) They were removed and placed on the head of the goat which was sent to the wilderness.
