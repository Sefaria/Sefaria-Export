Verse 1


The word "וישב" (And he settled) is composed of the same letters as the names Joseph, Dinah, Esau, and Laban. Our Rabbi Ephraim, may his memory be blessed, in his commentary, interpreted it cryptically. It is worth examining why these specific letters were chosen. It is possible that these letters, which allude to troubles, hint at the salvation because they spell out "ישוב" (settlement), indicating that ultimately there was settlement for him, and God placed peace for him from all his troubles. Since, in the end, he had settlement, significant like those, all his days were in a state of settlement, as our Sages mentioned. It also hints that "וישב" is a notarikon for "יסורין בתחילה ולבסוף שלוה" (suffering in the beginning and peace in the end).

Verse 2



Verse 3

Jacob loved Joseph more than all his sons because he was the son of his old age. It is possible that Jacob (peace be upon him) sought to rectify through Joseph what Adam did, as our Sages (may their memory be blessed) interpreted, and after all the trouble, Leah misled him, and he thought she was Rachel. When it was morning, and behold, it was Leah, just as it says in the verse: "And it came to pass in the morning, behold, it was Leah." This caused great distress to Jacob because after completing the rectification, a prohibition of illicit relations came upon him. Perhaps he lost all that he had rectified.Therefore, with Rachel, who had a problem, as mentioned by Rabbi Mordechai Gimpel Yaffe Zatzal, "God made that she gave birth to Joseph," who is a soul of Adam's World to come, to inform Jacob (peace be upon him) that he did not commit a prohibition. Everything he did was a complete rectification. This fruit born in Joseph represents the soul of Adam's World to come to complete the rectification. Joseph embodies the aspect of Foundation (Yesod).This is the reason Jacob (peace be upon him) loved Joseph, as it is a great testimony regarding Joseph, as God already desired his actions. This is indicated by "And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons," with the numerical value of "son of his old age" being equivalent to "Adam with everything." He made for him a coat of many colors, which is the light of the clothing of Adam. As Rabbi Karban Shabbat explains, the numerical value of "son of his old age" is the letters Aleph, Mem, Nun, Yud, which hint at the unique designation, Kav and Vav. It also hints that the numerical value is 90, as Joseph was born when Jacob was 91, according to the hint mentioned as our Sages explained. It is written, "And Jacob settled," and afterwards, it says, "And Israel loved Joseph." It is possible that Joseph was in the place of David, who is the chariot. When he touched the hollow of his thigh, he was called Israel, as a hint that David was the chariot. When he comes in his place, Joseph, and for this reason, "And Israel loved Joseph." Alternatively, Joseph was in the place of David, and the hint is that David was the chariot, and when he comes in his place, Joseph, and that is why it says, "And Israel loved Joseph." Alternatively, as our Sages said, Joseph is called El, and if so, it is permitted to have two sisters. According to this, "And Israel loved Joseph." Otherwise, as Rabbi Shaul says, "And Israel loved Joseph," means that he called him El, and if so, it is permissible to have two sisters. According to this, "And Israel loved Joseph," as Rachel, who is hinted at by Israel, is permitted, and therefore, he loved Joseph more than all his sons.

"They saw him from a distance." The explanation is that they foresaw Joseph in the distant future, distanced from the service of God due to the calves of Jeroboam. Before he approaches, they will revolt against him. The great Rabbi, Rabbi Yedidya El-Farchi, may his memory be a blessing, explained that it has been many years since I, the poor one, have directed my attention more to the knowledge of the Almighty, in an expanded sense, with the help of God.

Verse 33

A wicked beast devoured him; Joseph was truly devoured. It is possible that the Holy Spirit alluded to it in his mouth, and the intention is that, just as the Holy Spirit is directed, so was the wicked beast Potiphar's wife, who was possessed by the evil inclination. She was intensely involved in every possible way to ensnare Joseph because the redemption of Israel and the rectification of Adam's sin depended on him. If, God forbid, Joseph would sin, the world would be destroyed. The adversary sought to tempt him doubly, and the rest of the nations hoped to see Joseph fail, God forbid. However, God did not forsake him, and he was saved. It was a rectification for Adam's sin and the salvation of Israel from exile. But this wicked beast, an evil thought, God associates with the action, and it is considered as if a wicked beast devoured him. But the truth is, Joseph was truly devoured, tormented and afflicted, even though he later ended up in prison, as our sages have said. But after all the torment, Joseph remained righteous, firm in his faith, and was saved by the mercy of God.

Verse 6

The bread, which is food, and Joseph was handsome of form and handsome of appearance." This assisted him in placing all that he possessed in the hands of Potiphar, for the needs of beauty are closer to being successful in them, like one who is as a wing flapping. Additionally, he is a sign of beauty of character because the eye and the face are like a solid indicator for the internal matter. "The bread, which is food," refers to the new Torah that he was engaged in, and in this, he was handsome of appearance according to the new revealed light. The great Rabbi Yedidya of Zarfat explained in his commentary, "For." This does not contradict what the sages said, that wisdom is necessary in an unattractive vessel, as this applies specifically to the aspect of learning. It was said, "If one merits Torah, he will certainly merit beauty of character." However, in the general sense, beauty indicates perfection of character. According to the interpretation of the Rabbi , who explained, "The bread, which is food," regarding Joseph's engagement in Torah, it is thus stated, "And Joseph was handsome of form, etc.," and this is a reasonable and correct interpretation.

Verse 5


"We remember the fish." From here we learn that one should light candles on Shabbat. I heard that this is a teaching of the Sages. The insightful Rabbi Eliezer Daavila z”l explained that it seems puzzling why they said, "We remember the fish," when they could taste anything they wanted. It must be that visual appearance is essential, as it is said, "The eye is not satisfied with seeing," implying that there is satisfaction in seeing. From this, one can understand that it is necessary to light a candle on Shabbat, as it is written, "And you shall call the Shabbat a delight," and the eye will be satisfied by seeing the Shabbat foods. Thus, I heard from the aforementioned rabbi z”l.
Some have challenged the rabbi’s words, questioning how the statement "We remember the fish" proves that visual appearance is essential. Perhaps "We remember the fish" refers to impure fish, as the manna did not change to taste like impure things, and therefore, there is no proof to light Shabbat candles from this.
But I, the simple one, can uphold the rabbi’s words. It seems that even if one wished to taste something impure, the manna would change. Since the food is permitted, even if it tastes like something forbidden, it is allowed. This is similar to what is stated in Chullin 72b: Yalta said to Rav Nachman, "Everything that the Merciful One forbade us, He permitted us something similar. He forbade us blood but permitted us liver; He forbade us niddah but permitted us pure blood, etc. We wish to eat meat with milk." He said to her, "Roast for her an udder." Hence, everything that is permitted, even if it tastes like the forbidden, is allowed. Similarly, the manna could change and taste like the forbidden thing that a person imagines, since the manna is entirely permissible.
Thus, the rabbi's words are upheld as explained. There is a hint in the verse, "And you shall call the Shabbat a delight (עונג)," which has the same numerical value as "eye (עין)" with the addition, hinting that one should light candles on Shabbat for the sake of visual enjoyment, as discussed.
