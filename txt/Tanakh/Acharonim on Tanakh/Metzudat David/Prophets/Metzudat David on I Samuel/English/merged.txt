Metzudat David on I Samuel



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>Ramatayim of the Tzufites:</b> That is the name of the place, due to there being two tall (<i>ramot</i>) mountains, viewing (<i>tzofot</i>) one across from the other.
<b>Efrati (Ephraimite):</b> It is speaking about Tzuf. As he too was from Mount Ephraim, but not from the Children of Ephraim. From he was a Levite, specifically from the sons of Korach. 

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>This man used to go up:</b> His custom was always to go up to Shiloh every year, to bow down and sacrifice to God.
<b>Priests:</b> Meaning to say, assistants of the [high] priesthood. As their father, Eli, served as the high priest.

Verse 4

<b>And it was on that day:</b> Meaning to say, when the day came that he would bring his sacrifices, Elkanah would sacrifice peace-offerings and he would give portions to Peninah, etc. from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.

Verse 5

<b>One portion:</b> Meaning to say, unique in its fineness. And to explain further, it said, "<i>apayim</i> (face)" - one fitting to be received with a joyful face.
<b>But the Lord had closed her womb:</b> So she did not give birth and she was distressed. And that is why he showed her extra love, to mitigate her pain.

Verse 6

<b>And her rival would anger her:</b> Peninah, her rival wife, would anger her with words.
<b>Very much anger:</b> Meaning to say, she would repeat it and anger [her] often.
<b>So that she should complain:</b> In order that Channah would be furious and fume.
<b>Because the Lord had shut up her womb:</b> Meaning to say, and there was room for Peninah to anger her with this. And it is like our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said, "She said to her mockingly, 'Did you buy your older son a cloak today, or your younger son, a shirt?'" And she was bitter-spirited as well on account of her barrenness, and the matter would easily anger her.

Verse 7

<b>And as he would do this:</b> Elkanah would do this each year, to give Channah a choice portion.
<b>So she would anger her:</b> Like, so she would anger her (the spelling of the word could also be read as, "So would she get angry.") And it is meaning to say, he would do his [part] to show love to her, and Peninah would likewise do her [part, to anger her].  
<b>And she wept:</b> Every time they would come to Shiloh, she would cry from the great grief. And because of that, she was prevented from having the desire to eat. 

Verse 8

<b>And why is your heart grieved:</b> Why should your heart be broken from grieving for the lack of children? 
<b>Am I not:</b> Yonatan [ben Uzziel] translated [it as], "Is not my wish" - meaning to say, "Is not my wish towards you and my love for you better to you than if you had given birth to ten sons?"

Verse 9

<b>Channah rose</b> to go to the House of the Lord.
<b>After eating:</b> Even if it is stated above (I Samuel 1:7), "and she wept and would not eat," she nevertheless ate a little to keep herself alive. 

Verse 10

<b>And she was bitter in spirit:</b> When she came to pray, her spirit was very bitter.

Verse 11

<b>Upon the affliction:</b> Upon that which I am afflicted with pain and grief.
<b>And You will remember me and not forget:</b> It repeated the thing with different words for further clarification and in the way of those praying.
<b>The offspring of men:</b> Meaning to say, male children.
<b>Then I will give him to the Lord:</b> Meaning to say, I will take it upon myself as a vow that I will give him to the Lord.
<b>All the days of his life:</b> Meaning to say, he will always dedicate himself to the service of the Lord.
<b>And a razor, etc.:</b> He will be a nazerite forever without shaving, and like the law of a nazerite.

Verse 12

<b>Watched her mouth:</b> Meaning to say, he would watch what came out of her lips, to hear her words.

Verse 13

<b>And Channah:</b> But, "Channah was praying in her heart" - meaning to say, in a whisper, as if she was speaking to her heart, so it was not audible to Eli. 
<b>And he thought she was drunk:</b> For this is the way of a drunkard to move his lips, but there is 'no speech and no words.'

Verse 14

<b>Will you be drunk:</b> Will you show yourself to be drunk a long time; and until when? 
<b>Remove your wine:</b> If you drank much wine, do something to remove the drunkenness of the wine, through sleep and that which is similar.

Verse 15

<b>No, my lord:</b> Meaning to say - you, my lord, the matter is not like this. Rather, "I am a woman of troubled spirit," meaning to say, distressed and worried. But I have come here knowingly to pray; and not without intention like a drunkard. For "I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink."
<b>But I have been pouring out, etc.:</b> Meaning to say, and do not wonder about that which my lips move but my voice is not heard. For is it not that it is before the Lord that I have been pouring out my soul? So why should I raise my voice to make it heard to another?

Verse 16

<b>Do not take:</b> Do not think of me as an unbridled woman, to come drunk to the House of the Lord. Meaning to say, if the truth is like your words, why should I prolong my words so much in prayer?
<b>For it is out of the greatness of my grievance and my anger:</b> For it is due to the greatness of the telling of the troubles and the anger with which Peninah angered me that I spoke in front of the Lord until now, as they are great.

Verse 17

<b>He grant what you have asked:</b> Fulfill your request. And he said [this] in the way of a prayer.

Verse 18

<b>May she find:</b> Meaning to say, behold I have found favor in your eyes. For I consider that which you requested mercy upon me, to be finding favor. So she showed thankfulness with her words.
<b>And she ate:</b> From now on, she ate all she needed and she no longer had the fury that she had for a long time. For she trusted in Eli's prayer.

Verse 19

<b>And the Lord remembered her:</b> Her recollection came up before Him for the good.

Verse 20

<b>As the cycles and days Channah conceived passed:</b> Meaning to say, at the time of the completion of the cycle of days of the pregnancy from the time that Channah conceived.
<b>And she gave birth to a son,</b> at the end of the cycle.
<b>For I requested him from the Lord:</b> And it is a play on words.

Verse 21

<b>Went up:</b> When the time of his going up arrived, he went up to sacrifice.
<b>The annual sacrifice:</b> What he was accustomed to sacrificing every year.
<b>And his vow:</b> He brought that which he vowed the whole year and was in his house, to sacrifice them at the time of his going up.

Verse 22

<b>Did not go up:</b> That year.
<b>Until the boy will be weaned:</b> Meaning to say, I will not move from here "until the boy will be weaned." But after he is weaned, "I will bring him" also to the House of the Lord, "that he may appear before the Lord," to bow down before Him; and to thank Him for the boy that was born.
<b>And he shall abide there:</b> The boy will abide there forever - meaning to say, all the days of Eli, so that he may serve him.

Verse 23

<b>What is proper in your eyes:</b> Meaning to say, do according to your wish, and remain until you wean him. 
<b>But may the Lord fulfill His/his word:</b> Meaning to say, that which you said here that you will remain until you wean [him], behold this thing is given over to your hands, to do with yourself as you want. But that which you said about the boy, that he should abide in the House of the Lord forever, behold that thing is not in your hands to vow it. However, "May the Lord fulfill" the word that you said about the boy, and He place it into his heart to abide in His house forever. (And the word, "his word," is referring to the boy, meaning to say, the word that was said about the boy and regarding him.)
<b>So the woman remained</b> in her home and did not go up.

Verse 24

<b>With three bulls:</b> With three bulls to sacrifice to the Lord, and the flour for the grain offering and the wine for the libations.
<b>And she brought him:</b> The lad.
<b>And the lad was a lad:</b> Meaning to say, the lad was a small and delicate lad. Yet, in spite of all this, it did not prevent her from bringing him when she weaned him.

Verse 25

<b>And they slaughtered, etc.:</b> Meaning to say, when they slaughtered the first bull, they brought the lad to Eli to show him that his prayer was accepted.

Verse 26

<b>Please, my lord:</b> She requested from Eli, and made him swear by his own soul, to keep his eye on the lad.
<b>Who stood:</b> Who stood here when you too were here sitting, as it is written above (I Samuel 1:9), "and Eli the priest sat, etc." 

Verse 27

<b>It was this boy I prayed for:</b> Meaning to say, the prayer that I had prayed then was to ask for a son. And behold, this is the one to whom I gave birth.

Verse 28

<b>And also:</b> Meaning to say, also at the time of the prayer, I then vowed to lend him to the Lord, to always dedicate himself to His service.
<b>That he was (lived):</b> It is like, as he will be - meaning to say, all the time that he will be in this world, he is lent to the Lord.
<b>And he bowed down to the Lord there:</b> He bowed down to thank the Lord, who set up his portion to be among the servants of the Lord.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>And Channah prayed:</b> The actual prayer is at the end of her words; but, at the beginning, she structured the praises of the Omnipresent. And that is why it states, "and she said" [other words that introduced the prayer].
<b>My heart exults in the Lord:</b> My heart rejoices in the salvation of the Lord.
<b>My horn is exalted:</b> To gore my enemies; and she said this about Peninah and her sons. And it is a type of metaphor to say that from now on, they would not be able to pain her like before.
<b>My mouth is enlarged:</b> Since, until now, I was like a silent lamb which does not open its mouth. But now, my mouth is enlarged upon my enemies, to answer with words.
 <b>Because I rejoice in Your salvation:</b> My joy is about that which the salvation comes from You. And there is enough in this to answer with words.

Verse 2

<b>For there is none beside You:</b> Meaning to say, there is no creator besides You; and who among the creatures has holiness comparable to the holiness of the Creator?

Verse 3

<b>Do not abound, etc.:</b> She said it about Peninah and her sons, do not abound in speaking uppity things - meaning to say, pride and rudeness. And she repeated the word (elevated), to indicate great pride and its constancy.
<b>Arrogance come out:</b> The [one], "do not," that she said, serves in the place of two. ("Do not" only actually appears at the beginning of this verse, and not before this phrase). It is as if she said, "Do not let arrogance come out of your mouths."
<b>For the Lord is a God of knowledge:</b> The Lord is a God who knows everything, and the acts of the creatures are enumerated before Him.

Verse 4

<b>The bows:</b> Meaning to say, and since he knows everything - because of that, He repays a person according to his deed. So suddenly the bows and the strength of the mighty are broken, "and the faltering are girded with strength."

Verse 5

<b>The sated:</b> People who were sated became hungry, to the point that they must hire themselves out to work for the sake of bread.
<b>And the hungry:</b> And those who hired themselves out on account of their hunger stopped hiring themselves out, as they found enough for their needs.
<b>Until the barren has born seven:</b> Meaning to say, His providence is so great, until the one who was barren has born seven sons and the one who was the mother of many is cut off by the loss of all her sons.

Verse 6

<b>The Lord kills, and gives life:</b> Meaning to say, this does not come by happenstance, but rather the hand of the Lord did this. He kills the sons of the mother of many, and He gives life to the sons of the barren one, so [that] she does not become bereaved from birth, from the womb and from pregnancy.
<b>He brings down to the grave:</b> And with this, he brings the mother of many to the grave - meaning to say, with the lowliness of this condition and the depth of the distress; whereas He raises the barren one from the deep lowliness of her condition. 

Verse 7

<b>The Lord makes poor</b> the sated, until they are hired out for bread.
<b>And makes rich</b> the hungry, until they cease [to hire themselves out].  
<b>And brings low:</b> He brings low the pride of the [formerly] sated ones through this. And He even raises the hungry over them. So it is not enough that they cease hiring themselves out, but they also hire the sated ones, and they rise further above them.

Verse 8

<b>He raises up the poor out of the dust:</b> The one that was poor and disgraced and bowed to the dust - the Lord will raise him up from the dust.
<b>From the dunghill:</b> It repeated the thing with different words.
<b>To set:</b> He lifts him up from the dunghills, and raises him further to set him with nobles, to be similar to them.
<b>To make them inherit:</b> Meaning to say, they will be honored in the eyes of the creatures as if they were accustomed to honor that they inherited from their fathers. 
<b>For the Lord’s:</b> And that is because the foundations of the world are the Lord's; and He made the world upon those foundations. That is why it is in His hands to do as He wishes in His world.

Verse 9

<b>He guards the steps of His faithful:</b> Meaning to say, indeed everything is with justice - for the steps of the righteous are guarded from being caught; but the evildoers are cut off when the darkness of [their] punishments comes, when their measure is full.
<b>For not by strength:</b> A person's surmounting is not dependent upon his strength, but it is rather in the hands of the Lord and according to the propriety of a person's deed.

Verse 10

<b>O Lord, may His/his adversaries be shattered:</b> As a closure to the order of the praises of the Omnipresent, she returned to praying for Shmuel, her son. So she said, "You O Lord, please let the adversaries of my son and the men fighting him be shattered and broken." For she saw with the holy spirit that the Philistines would fight against him, so she prayed that they would be shattered.
<b>Out of heaven shall/may He thunder upon them:</b> For the sake of my son, God - may He be blessed - should thunder over the Philistines. And her prayer was fulfilled - like it was written (I Samuel 7:10), "and the Lord thundered with a great sound, etc. against the Philistines."
<b>The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth:</b> Meaning to say,  You O Lord, please let my son judge the ends of the land, to be a judge in Israel and to go around in the places of their cities, to judge them. And this was likewise fulfilled, as it is written (I Samuel 7:16), "And he went, etc. and made the rounds, etc. and judged Israel."
<b>And He shall give power to His/his king:</b> May the Lord give power and strength to the king whom my son will crown, who is Shaul.  
<b>And exalt the horn of His/his anointed:</b> She said this about David. For Shmuel, her son, only anointed him as the king, but he did not crown him in his lifetime. As when Shmuel died, he was still not king until later. And Channah prayed about him, that the horn of his governance should be exalted.

Verse 11

 <b>In the presence of:</b> Meaning to say, in front of him. For he was teaching him how to serve the Lord.
