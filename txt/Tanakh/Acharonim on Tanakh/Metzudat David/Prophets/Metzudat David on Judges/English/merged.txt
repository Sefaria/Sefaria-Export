Verse 19

AND IT WAS WHEN THE JUDGE DIED: It wants to teach that the repentance did not last, because it was from the rebuke of the judge. And immediately the judge died, and there was no one to rebuke them, they returned and corrupted their path, the way of their forefathers that they were evilly doing before that judge.
THEY DID NOT OMMIT: They did not lessen from the misdeeds and paths of their forefathers that was difficult and evil 

Verse 20



Verse 21

FOR MY PART: Just as they acted, so too I will repay them
THAT JOSHUA LEFT FOR THEM: It wants to teach, he (Joshua) left them intentionally in their place and then he died. He did not want to expel all of them in his life time, as the pasig says in Shemot 23: 30, slowly, slowly I will expel them.

Verse 22

IN ORDER TO TEST: It wants to teach that because of this, Hashem chose this punishment, and not others in order to test Israel if they will serve their GD or if not. And this is why its written "if they will guard." 

Verse 23

AND HE (HASHEM) LEFT: Because of this, Hashem chose this as the punishment and He left these nation, that are listed below
...WITHOUT EXPELLING THEM QUICKLY: It wants to teach that in His wisdom he decreed not to expel them quickly, rather very slowly, and to "not immediately hand them over to Joshua." And Because of the punishment "in order to test them" He let them be all over, and He did not continue to expel a person from now on

Chapter 3



Verse 1

These are the incoming generations that did not know that they should make known all of the miracles that were done for Yehoshua at the time that they fought Canaan. And because of this, they become weak in their faith in Hashem. And for that, these nations were place to test them

Verse 2

ONLY SO THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW: It wants to teach that only because of this they will become aware of the wonders of the miracles that were done for them since then
...TO TEACH THEM WAR: It wants to say that with the remaining nations, did (Israel) not fight them (the nations)? Therefore it was a need to teach them the strategies of war. Because the generation before them, in the days of Yehoshua, they (that generation) did not know the strategies of war because Hashem fought for them. But after that, they needed to know it because of their actions Hashem will leave them to chance. Therefore they should be informed to know the miracles that were done since and trust in Hashem from now on

Verse 3

FIVE: Look back on the text before this where it says "and these are the nations... five...
...THE COMMANDERS OF THE PHILISTINES: It wants to teach, the places of their kingdoms. Even though Bnei Yehudah conquered them (the kingdoms) from the Philistines: Azah, Ashkelon, Ekron, as its written above, behold after a while, the Philistines returned took it (back) from their hands. Therefore Judah was not able to completely to expel them.
DWELLING IN MOUNT LEBANON: It wants to teach all of the Canaanites... that dwelt in Mount Lebanon to Mount Baal Hermon... to the place that they came to, Lebo Chamat.

Verse 4

these nations...
...WILL THEY LISTEN: without going after their gods

Verse 5



Verse 6

AND THEY TOOK: It wants to teach that they didn't withstand the test, and they took their daughters... at the end of the matter it was because of this that they ended up serving their gods

Verse 7

AND THEY DID: Up until this point in, the Book was speaking in general about the days of the judges. From now on, it returns to tell the details of the days about each of the judges. And it says that before the first judge was established, they acted evilly 

Verse 8



Verse 9

OTNIEL: It focuses on "savior" to teach that Otniel was established to save.

Verse 10

SPIRIT OF GD: The awakening of wisdom to judge, and the courage to wage war
...AND HE STRENGTHENED HIS HAND: He strengthened his hand for victory every time

Verse 11

AND IT WAS QUIET: By this, the land was quiet and rested from war until the end of the forty years from the time of the beginning of the slavery as its written in Seder Olam

Verse 12

AND HASHEM STRENGTHENED: They (Moabites) were weak, but Hashem strengthened them over Israel because of their evil actions.

Verse 13

More than just his nation

Verse 14



Verse 15

from the tribe of Benjamin
...A LEFTY (CRIPPLED). It is explained that the reason why the king of Moab was not guarded from Ehud's sword was because he was a lefty. Normally it (the sword) hangs on the left thigh so that its comfortable to grab with one's right hand, but this is not the case and therefore there was nothing noticeable on his left thigh underneath his outer garment and therefore they didn't feel anything because they did not think that he was a lefty
...AND THEY SEND... A TRIBUTE: So that they don't suspect anything and they trust him when they see him his submission in bringing a tribute

Verse 16

TWO MOUTHS: To kill him with ease and speed
...A CUBIT IN LENGTH. Less than the normal measurement of a sword so that he can gird it underneath his outer garment. It would have been noticeable bump if it was the length of a normal sword
ON HIS RIGHT THIGH: So that its easier for him to grab it with his left

Verse 17

A  stout man: this was also the reason for his death. Because he was fat and a big guy, it was hard for him to stand up and while he was busy with standing up, he was not able to guard himself from Ehud

Verse 18

FINISHED BRINGING: After he gave over the tribute
...AND HE SENT: Because with one it is easier to escape. This is not to for a group

Verse 19

He returned himself as if he forgot something.
Next to Gilgal.
A secret thing: It wants to teach that "I did not tell you this when I was here with the people who brought the tribute.
And he said silence: As its said "if its a secret matter in front of your people, be quiet and don't speak in the ears of my people who are standing here.
...And they left themselves when they heard the word of the king. 

Verse 20

He came close to him
on the upper cool level: when it was hot, he would sit in the upper level made of a lot of windows to cool himself down
By himself because those who were standing by him left
A word of Hashem: and as it appears that the proper thing is to stand when you hear it. And his intention was to slow him down when he was standing up so that he doesn't expect it

Verse 21

And Ehud Sent: (his sword) when he was still struggling to stand

Verse 22

Also the handle: so that he would die immediately without screaming. it was stuck deep.
And the fat closed it: he grabbed the blade of the sword so that it wouldn't come out. Ehud did not draw the sword from his stomach because he felt that less blood will drip on him and it will excite the people that will see it on his way out
the waste left him: this was a reason why (the guards) thought that he was reliving himself because the smell of the waste was disgusting

Verse 23

The upper cold room

Verse 24

He left form the portico 
It wants to say that nothing bad is happening, he's only reliving himself

Verse 25

For a long time: They waited a time that was appropriate that he would be done reliving himself even if he took a while.
The Key: It was in their hands to open the door from the outside

Verse 26

They waited and delayed until it became embarrassing 
Pesilim was in the land of Moab, and he ran to Seir that was from the land of Israel.

Verse 27

When he came to the land of Israel
and he blew (the shofar) to make a sign to gather

Verse 28

They chased after: its to say that they went quickly
Because Hashem gave: what was enough in his hand to kill the kind
The bank of the Jordan on the bank of Moab: the land of Moab was on the eastern bank of the Jordan, and they (the Jews) captured the place on the other side of the Jordan so as to not give the Moabites, that were in the land of Israel, permission to pass back into their own land

Verse 29

Because in the land of Israel they were the best of them
From the ones that were in the land of Israel 

Verse 30

the end of the eighty years is from the beginning of the subjugation 

Verse 31

In the year that Ehud died, Shmagar became a judge and he died in that year
Its to teach that this his salvation was not a great one as Ehud's was. but in any place, he did also made a salvation. 

Chapter 4



Verse 1

it wants to teach that from the day that Ehud died, and even during the days of Shmagar, they did evil. And its for this reason that his salvation was not a big one

Verse 2

Before Joshua captured Chatzor, as its written in Joshua 11:1, he smote it with a sword, but not its king. After he was captured (he saved himself?) and the king of Charoshet goyim, it was a place where all froms of iron work was done. 

Verse 3

it was because of the nine hundred chariots that they did not have the feeling of approaching them in battle stirring in their hears. they therefore cried out to Hashem in prayer
He oppressed Israel with a lot of strength.

Verse 4

<b>The wife of Lappidot:</b> That is to say, a woman of valor, zealous in her deeds as a torch afire. And this is poetic, and in the way that people speak. 
<b>She judged:</b> This elevated status came to her on account of her being a prophet, and zealous in her deeds; thus, she was judging Israel.

Verse 5

<b>Under the date palm:</b> So that she not be secluded with the men who would come to her for judgement, she fixed her place under the date palm. As there is no place for seclusion there (Megillah 14:1).
<b>Devorah, between Ramah and Bet El:</b> That is to say, Devorah was always between Ramah [and Beit El].
<b>And they would go up to her:</b> To that place.

Verse 6

<b>Did the Lord not command:</b> In truth, God did command [it]. As it was told to her in a prophecy, but it was not mentioned [in the text].
<b>Go and draw:</b> Draw the hearts of the Children of Israel, to entice them to come with you to Mount Tabor to wage war against Sisera. As they were very frightened of his large army.

Verse 7

<b>And I will draw:</b> That is to say, I will put it into his heart to come to the Kishon River.

Verse 8

<b>If you will go with me</b> to the war.

Verse 9

<b>However:</b> As glory is given to the general of the army in one of two ways. Either he shows courage in his heart and he goes to war without fear; or he or one of his people is victorious and kills the leader of the opposing force. And that is why she was saying, "Will not Sisera be killed by a woman" - and that was Yael, wife of Chever the Kenite, as it will be stated concerning this matter (Judges 4:21). If so, everyone will know that 'this was from the hand of the Lord.' Because its not by strength that a woman is victorious. And if so - if you are also afraid to go to war without me; if so, in the way that you are going, there will no longer be a path of glory that is appropriate for you, given that you are the general of the army. As there will be nothing [else] to glorify you.

Verse 10

<b>And he went up:</b> He brought up ten thousand to Mount Tabor, etc. - in that they went up after him, as in (Judges 8:4), "for the nation that is behind [me]" (literally, "at my feet," like here).

Verse 11

<b>Separated from Kayin:</b> He separated himself from the rest of the Sons of Kayin who dwelt in the Judean Desert, as it stated at the beginning of the book (Judges 1:16).
<b>Of the descendants of Chovav:</b> This refers to Kayin.
<b>And he pitched his tent:</b> And because it will be coming to say that Sisera escaped to the tent of Yael, the wife of Chever the Kenite - therefore it prefaced [it by] saying that Chever separated from Kayin and pitched his tent here.

Verse 12

<b>That he had gone up:</b> From this he understood that he wanted to wage war; and that is why he went up, to fortify himself on the mountain.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>Up:</b> That is to say, don't delay yourself, standing here to fortify yourself on the mountain
<b>For this is the day:</b> That is to say, the decree is set that today you will defeat Sisera, so you may no longer delay on the mountain.
<b>Has not the Lord:</b> Do not fear to go down to the valley, "as has not the Lord, etc."

Verse 15

<b>With the edge of the sword:</b> To be killed by the sharpness of the sword.
<b>On foot:</b> So that one of the Children of Israel not recognize him and catch him.

Verse 16

<b>Until (<i>ad</i>) one:</b> Even one.

Verse 17

 <b>To the tent:</b> To the side of the tent.
<b>For there was peace:</b> And because of this, he thought to escape there.

Verse 18

<b>Turn in:</b> She saw that he was like one in doubt whether to go to her tent or to flee further on. So she said to him, "Turn from the place that you are going, come to me and do not be afraid."

Verse 19

<b>A pouch of milk:</b> She gave him milk to drink, because it brings on slumber.
<b>And she covered him:</b> Because when she was giving him milk to drink, he became uncovered. So she covered him again.

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>A tent peg:</b> The peg that is made to be planted into the ground [together] with the lower edges of the tent.
<b>Stealthily:</b> So that he not wake him up from his sleep.
<b>And she fastened it to the ground:</b> She hit the peg with the hammer, until it passed [through] his temple and became stuck in the ground.
<b>For he was fast asleep:</b> That is to say, since he was fast asleep because of the milk, and he was exhausted because he had been fleeing on his feet - so  because of this, he died immediately. 

Verse 22

<b>He chased after Sisera:</b> According to his thinking, to seek him where he was.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b> And continued, etc.:</b> That is to say, more each time.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<b>Saying:</b> That is to say that the Children of Israel will say it.

Verse 2

<b>When there was the takings of vengeance (this is the translation of, <i>feroa peraot</i>, according to Radak):</b> That is to say, in that which the Holy One, blessed be He, took His vengeance through Israel - to make it appear as if it was through their strength that it was done, so that it would be glorious for them.
<b>When the people willingly offered themselves:</b> That is to say, because God put it into the hearts of the people to willingly offer themselves to war, even though they saw their weakness and the strength of Sisera.
<b>Bless the Lord:</b> Because of these two [reasons], bless the Lord.

Verse 3

<b>Hear O kings,</b> what I am speaking, so that you will fear to wage war with Israel any more.
<b>I unto the Lord:</b> That is to say, because I am for the Lord, and for His portion, to believe in Him - because of this...
<b>I will sing</b> about the salvation which comes to me from Him.

Verse 4

<b>When You came forth from Seir:</b> When you came forth in front of Israel, when they passed Mount Seir - because they then started to fight with Sichon and Og.
<b>When you marched out from the field of Edom:</b> It mentioned the matter twice with different words, as is the nature of verse.
<b>The earth quaked:</b> He made all the kings of the land tremble and quake .
<b>The heavens also dripped:</b> Terror and shaking seized the supernal ministering angels of the nations, like a man who trembles and the sweat drips from him.
<b>Water dripped</b> to make the nations tremble and become confusef with the sound of much rain.

Verse 5

<b>The mountains flowed</b> from the greatness of the shaking, and they dripped sweat.
<b>This Sinai:</b> Like this is Mount Sinai, about which it is stated (Exodus 19:18), "and the entire mountain trembled." Likewise, everyone shook from fear of the Lord who fights for Israel.

Verse 6

<b>In the days of Shamgar:</b> However during the days of the Judge, Shamgar, and during the days of Yael - since she also judged in the days of Shamgar - the salvation was not complete. So the nations did not tremble from fear of the Lord. And because of this, travelers on the ways ceased - due to fear of the nations.
<b>And wayfarers:</b> That is to say that the people that were compelled to go on the roads went on roundabout paths, so that no one would detect them.

Verse 7

<b>Inhabitation of the villages ceased,</b> because they were afraid to settle in the unwalled cities. And this only ceased with Israel, but not with the other nations. As they were not afraid of Israel, such that they not dwell in unwalled cities. For they had the upper hand.
<b>Until I Devorah, arose:</b> That is to say, it was like this until I arose, I Devorah. As from now, it will be like before. For the salvation that comes through me is complete and the nations will tremble from the Lord. So Israel will not cease from going on the roads or settling in the unwalled cities.
<b>A mother:</b> Like a mother who chastises her son to straighten out his way, so too am I to Israel.

Verse 8

<b>They chose new gods:</b> For when Israel chooses new gods, then war comes to their cities on account of the punishment; but not when they better their ways. As was it not that in the days of Yehoshua, it was stated (Joshua 4:13), "About forty thousand, etc. went across, etc. to the steppes of Yericho?" And was there any shield and spear seen with these forty thousand? For was it not by a miracle that they captured Yericho, and not through war and with a shield and a spear?

Verse 9

<b>My heart is with Israel’s lawmakers:</b> That is to say, it is not only lip service, but rather from the depths of the heart that I will speak to the lawmakers of Israel who voluntarily offer themselves to wage war, that they should bless the Lord for that which He put into their hearts to offer themselves voluntarily.

Verse 10

<b>You riders:</b> Whether the ministers that ride on white donkeys due to [their] great exaltation, or whether the sages that sit in judgement, or whether the merchants who travel on the way - all of you should orate and speak the praises of the Lord! The ministers, because their greatness remained; the sages. because they are now able to expand their hearts with wisdom without concerns for fear of the nations; and the merchants, because they are now able to go on paved ways and not the roundabout paths.

Verse 11

<b>Louder than the sound of the archers:</b> That is to say, in place of the sound, that was heard, of archers that would shoot at those who would go to draw water - in place of that sound, they will now hear the sound of those recounting the righteous acts of the Lord. And these are the righteous acts that He did for the [unwalled] villages in Israel which had been desolate. As when there was the salvation, the people of the Lord then returned to their villages.

Verse 12

<b>Awake, awake:</b> That is to say, strengthen yourself to speak in song. And she repeated her words because that is the way of song, and out of great enthusiasm.
<b>Take your captives:</b> That is to say, with the strengthening of the song, the salvation will intensify.

Verse 13

<b>Then:</b> With the strengthening of the song and the salvation's intensification; then [in order that] those that remain of Israel will rule over the mighty of the nations, which is referring to the mighty nations,...
<b>The Lord subdued for me:</b> The Lord has given me dominion over the warriors of the nations. And it repeated this matter with what it said.

Verse 14

<b>From Ephraim:</b> From the tribe of Ephraim and their source; and that is Yehoshua, their prince
<b>In Amalek:</b> From back then, he fought against Amalek and weakened them - as it is written (Exodus 17:13), "And Yehoshua weakened Amalek."
<b>After you:</b> It is as if she is speaking to Ephraim and saying, "After the war of Yehoshua, who came from you; Shaul, who comes from Binyamin, will come and fight Amalek with a great troop that will come out with him - from you, Israel." And it is as it is written (I Samuel 15:4), "and he counted them, etc. 200,000."
<b>From Machir came down leaders:</b> The ministers of the sons of Machir the son of Menashe came down to this war against Sisera; and all of them came down from Zevulun - even the scribes, even as they were unexperienced in warfare. 

Verse 15

<b>And Yissachar’s leaders:</b> That is to say, even as the leaders of Yissachar sat with Devorah all the time to teach laws and statutes to Israel - as it is written (I Chronicles 12:33), "And of the children of Yissachar who had understanding of the times, etc." Yet if so, they had never experienced going to war. Nevertheless, Yissachar did so, just like Barak, and came down to war like him.
<b>Dispatched to the valley, at his heels:</b> As earlier, it is stated (Judges 4:14) that Devorah said to Barak to go down from the mountain to the valley to confront the war; and Barak listened to her and they went down. Accordingly, she said that also with this, Yissachar did like Barak. For in the valley into which he was dispatched to go down by the word of the Lord through Devorah, they followed at Barak's heels - that is to say, with his going and after him - and were not afraid to go down into the valley. (And the word, dispatched, refers back to Yissachar. Since the word of the Lord that was through Devorah was for the whole nation; but due to [his] honor, she directed the speech to Barak, since he was the general of the army.)
<b>With the divisions of Reuven:</b> That is to say, if all of these tribes did not fear from coming down to war - not in the past, present, nor future - accordingly, with the divisions of Reuven, meaning that which Reuven detached and separated [itself], great decisions of the heart [are called for]. That is to say, behold it is suitable to contemplate many thoughts of the heart to understand this thing - what was with them, such that they did detached [themselves] from the war.

Verse 16

<b>Why did you stay among the sheepfolds:</b> That is to say, if you answer that you are frightened to come down to war, to face weaponry - if so, why at first did you settle the holding on the other side of the Jordan, between the border of the Land of Israel and the border of the nations? Is that not a dangerous place? So why did you choose to settle on this border?
<b>To listen:</b> That is to say, that which you requested that land with your saying (Numbers 32:4), "it is a land of livestock, and your servants have livestock" - was your request [in order] to sit at home to listen to the whistling of the flocks and cattle? And did it not enter your mind that you will perforce come down to war, from your settling on the border?
<b>For the divisions:</b> Hence it is suitable to search greatly [with] searchings of the heart, to understand the truth of the matter [about] why Reuven separated from the war. 

Verse 17

<b>Gilead, etc.</b> That is to say,  that if we would think that it is because of this that Reuven did not come to the war - because his inheritance is on the other side of the Jordan, far away from the location of the war - does not Gilead also dwell on the other side of the Jordan? Nevertheless, they still came to the war, as it is written above (Judges 5:14), "from Machir, etc." - and that is Gilead.
<b>And Dan, etc.:</b> That is to say, also about Dan should we be very angry. For why should he gather all that he has, to place it in his ships, and flee? Is his inheritance not very close to the location of the war? And if so, why did Asher flee and not come to the war, etc.? That is to say, if Asher also did not come here - it did not do so blameworthily, but rather only because his inheritance is on the sea and his cities are open and spread out without a wall. So as a result, he stayed near his open cities, so that the nations close to the border not go into them.

Verse 18

<b>Zevulun, etc.:</b> That is to say, Zevulun however did what is good. For it is a nation that mocked and belittled his [own] life, to go to war. And his life was not [so] precious in his eyes, to be concerned lest he die in war.
<b>And Naphtali, etc.</b> That is to say, and likewise Naphtali also did not worry about dying upon the open heights of the war's location. (Granted, God commanded taking the Children of Zevulun and the Children of Naphtali to war, as it is written above (Judges 4:6); and He did not command bringing [men] from the other tribes to the war. Nevertheless, Devorah was angry with Reuven and with Dan about their not coming on their own, the way the other tribes had come.)

Verse 19

<b>The kings came:</b> That is to say, [some of] the tribes of Israel did not come to the assistance of their brothers; whereas the kings of other lands came to the assistance of Sisera and fought for him.
<b>Then:</b> At the time that Sisera fought, the kings of Canaan fought with a large mass. As [although] they fought at Taanakh, the edge of the camp reached the waters of Megiddo.
<b>Spoil:</b> They came to his assistance for free and they did not take spoil of silver as their reward. And she said this, like someone angry, "Did the nations not come for free to the assistance of Sisera? So why did Reuven and Dan not come to the assistance of their brothers?"

Verse 20

<b>They fought from heaven:</b> That is to say, even without them, however, Sisera fell. And it was as if they fought with him from the heavens, and as if the stars swerved from their paths and from the way of their trajectories and descended and fought with Sisera. But our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Pesachim 118b) that the stars heated up the armor (such that it was too hot to touch). So they went  into the Kishon Rivor to cool [it] down, but the waters of the river washed them away.

Verse 21

<b>The Kishon River swept them away:</b> As the war was at the edge of the river; and the waters of the river miraculously grew and washed them away.
<b>That ancient river, etc.:</b> That is to say, behold the water of the river which had been in the Kishon River earlier and from always - was it not slight, to the point that I would step in it boldly without injury. But now, how is it that it miraculously grew to the point that it washed away the nations?

Verse 22

<b>Then they pounded:</b> That is to say, when they saw the river rushing, they fled for their lives on the horses. But then the hoofs of the horses were broken from the galloping and the jumping that his mighty men, the riders of the horses, did with them. Or the word, "<i>abiriv</i> (his strong ones)," refers back to the horses (and not the riders). So that is to say, [they broke] from the galloping of his strong horses.

Verse 23

<b>Curse Meroz:</b> You - curse the place, Meroz.
<b>Said:</b> The angel said to curse it. And [Devorah] said it prophetically. 
<b>Curse, etc.:</b> That is to say, curse it, saying, "Cursed are the inhabitants of Meroz" - since they did not come to the assistance of the Lord's people, even though they were close to the war's location.
<b>To the assistance of the Lord with the warriors:</b> She repeated the matter, to explain what assistance it was. So she said, to the assistance of the people of the Lord, who are fighting with the warriors - and [the warriors] are Sisera's men.

Verse 24

<b>Blessed, etc.:</b> Since she said to curse the inhabitants of Meroz, she [also] said, "But Yael is to be blessed by the mouths of the women, because she assisted Israel."
<b>Than/from women in tents:</b> That is to say, by the mouths of righteous and modest women who dwell in tents. It is from these women that she she should be blessed, so that the blessing will be fulfilled - even if the angel of the Lord did not say it, like the curse of Meroz.

Verse 25

<b>He requested water:</b> That is to say - understand the wisdom of Yael: For Sisera requested water, but she gave him milk - as it is written above (Judges 4:19), "and she opened a pouch of milk and gave him to drink." And that was in order to bring him to sleep.
<b>In a bowl of the noblemen:</b> And so that his heart be confident about her and not sense the thing, she brought curds before him in an eminent bowl - one from which it is fitting to feed noblemen and dignitaries - in order that he think that he was precious in her eyes, and that she considered him to be a lord.

Verse 26

<b>Her hand, etc.:</b> Meanwhile she herself reached out her left hand to take the tent pin and reached out her right to take a hammer that is called, a toilers' striker - on account of people toiling in their work and striking with it to do their work.  
<b>And she struck Sisera:</b> She struck and broke Sisera and removed his head. She attacked him with striking and wounding, and pierced his temple from side to side with the pin.

Verse 27

<b>Between her feet he sank:</b> He sank in front of her, upon his feet. And he fell immediately to the ground and remained prostrate; and he did not rise again. And that is to say, he was killed very quickly. And she repeated the words for emphasis, and in the way of verse.
<b>Where he sank:</b> In the place where he sank, that is where the destroyed and disgraced Sisera fell. For he could not strengthen himself again after the sinking. And this is from the poetics of verse, as he did not truly sink nor fall (as he was already laying down).

Verse 28

<b>Through the window:</b> She went back to recount in her song about the mother of Sisera peering through the window, to see if her son's chariot was coming. And when she saw that he was not [coming], she wailed bitterly, while constantly peering through the lattice and saying, "Why did his chariot tarry in coming, why so late, etc." And she repeated the matter, as is the way of one wailing on account of a pained heart. 

Verse 29

<b>The wisest of her ladies:</b> The wisest [of those] who were among her ladies - each one answered to console her. And she was also like one of them, answering her speech to herself.

Verse 30

<b>Did they not find:</b> That is to say, that these are the words of their consolation: Did they not find great wealth in Israel? So they must be dividing the spoils there among themselves. And that is why they are delaying in coming. 
<b>A wombed one:</b> Each one even took for himself a maiden or two as spoil.
<b>Spoil of dyed cloths:</b> The spoil of dyed clothes which were the most eminent would be given to Sisera, on account of his being the general of the army. And she then goes back to explain that this was the spoil of dyed embroidered clothes which can be seen on both sides. But the dyed doubly embroidered clothes which cannot be seen on both sides, which was very, very eminent, would be divided among all [the recipients of] the spoil, to place around his neck as an ornament. For this is what they are made for from the start and are not suitable for [any] other use. And that is why they would be divided among all of them. And they are hence delaying to come because of all of this.

Verse 31

<b>So may they perish:</b> Devorah said, "Behold these were vain consolations. And if only 'all of Your enemies would  perish so,' You O Lord, like Sisera perished.
<b>But His friends:</b> But may God's friends be as the sun in the morning, which continuously shines more, until it is in its might - which is noon. So too should God's friends continuously grow strong until they be at the heights of elevation.
<b>And it was tranquil:</b> This is not from the words of the song, but are rather words of the book's writer. 
<b>Forty years:</b> Until the end of forty years from the time of the beginning of the subjugation.

<b>And he did to her [as he had vowed]</b>. She separated from human company to live alone, busy with the worship of God. And our teachers of blessed memory have said (Ta'anit 4a) that he vowed to sacrifice as a burnt offering all that came out of his house, and so he performed his vow. 
<b>And she had not known a man</b> It wishes to say, as he had vowed, so she had done, and she had separated from men.
