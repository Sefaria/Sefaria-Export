Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



<b>like a slice, etc.</b> The top of your face from here and from there was oval and reddish, mixed with white - like the appearance of a slice cut out of a pomegranate. And they were hidden inside, behind a veil. So that, by this, they would draw greater love and desire than if they were revealed without a veil. And the analogue is the Sanhedrin, the judges of the community, who are like the face of the congregation; and they were filled with every wisdom and knowledge, like a pomegranate is full of seeds. And they would hide their wisdom in their hearts and not showcase it before [other] people.
