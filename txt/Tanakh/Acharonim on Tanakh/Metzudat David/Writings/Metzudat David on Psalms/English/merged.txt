Magnifies. And, through this, "I will praise you amidst the nations" (Psalm 18:50), for I shall recount, saying, "Know that Adonai magdil ["magnifies"] salvations--that is to say--performs great [acts of] salvation for God's king and not as compensation but amidst lovingkindness."
And to his seed. And so shall be done for his seed for eternity.

1. You are like sharp arrows in the warrior's hands, because he kills with them from a distance. So too you, who are speaking lashon hara and you will kill the one who is standing at a distance.
2. You are like coals made from rotem (juniper) wood, because although they seem to be extinguished on the outside, they are still burning on the inside. So too you, who [externally] speak smoothly to a person, but privately you are speaking lashon hara about him.

As the dew of Hermon – Like the dew which descends from Mount Hermon onto the mountains of Zion which are lower than it, so comes the influx by way of the king to the rest of the people. 
for there in Zion the Lord commanded the blessing, life forever. That is to say that the inflow comes to Zion and rests first on the king who rules there, and from there it is poured out on the rest of the people. Therefore it is good that they be united.
