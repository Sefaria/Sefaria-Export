Palgei Mayim on Lamentations

Introduction







Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>How she sits alone.</b> The text describes a situation where distress is mentioned first, followed by the mention of the preceding goodness. Similarly, when it describes being like a widow, the order is reversed, and it mentions being a servant in foreign lands before mentioning the distress. The reason for this is that when expressing their distress, they use the language of "How" (איכה), which is not commonly used by anyone. There are two types of divisions: one is a division in the essence of the matter, such as someone who divides their wealth, which is considered abundant wealth compared to others, or someone who divides their poverty, which is considered impoverished to the point of lacking bread and clothing to cover their body. And the second type of division is in relation to what came before, such as a great and awesome king who is reduced from his kingdom and is left with only a fraction of the people. The distress is not in the division itself but rather in relation to what came before. In contrast, if it were stated the other way around, saying "How the city that was once so populous is now sitting alone," I would say that the division of distress was not in its essence but rather in relation to what came before. Therefore, it says, "How she sits alone," indicating that the loneliness, in its essence, was in a state of division that was never experienced before, as "from year to year, from bird to beast, they wander and go." Only afterwards does it mention its preceding goodness, which was elevated above all. This implies that even in its second division, there was also a division. Similarly, when it is described as a widow, widows exist throughout history, and there has never been a woman like this. Then it mentions its preceding goodness and its significance. In contrast, when it is described as a servant among the nations, the imposition of tribute is not a division in its essence. Many nations impose tribute, and it is not a division itself but rather in relation to what came before. Therefore, its preceding greatness is mentioned first, as it served over all the nations, and as a punishment for this, the division that came in the form of tribute is considered. And regarding the statement "Rabbotai," with the letter Yod at the end, it is as if the Almighty is saying, "It is significant to Me that I have not withheld My glory except from Israel." It refers to three things: Jerusalem, which remains desolate without its inhabitants; Israel, who are left like a widow, lacking the abundance of the Holy Spirit; and the land of Israel, whose rulership has been transformed into the imposition of tribute.

Verse 2

<b>You shall weep bitterly at night.</b> The prophet explains that the reason for the punishment mentioned in the previous verse was due to the sin of the weeping on that night, which refers to the weeping of the spies. So that people would not wonder why the later generation would be held accountable for the sin of the spies that occurred many generations ago, he said, "And its tear is upon its cheek." This means that even the later generation still despised the desirable land, turned away from holiness, and chose the impurity of idolatry. It is as if he said that the tears of the spies, who despised the desirable land, are still on the cheeks of this generation as well. And therefore...
<b>She has no consolation.</b> She had no comfort.
<b>From all her lovers. </b>Of all the prophets during the time of destruction, none prophesied only for good. As it is written (Jeremiah 38:32), "We will not seek peace for this city, only disaster."
<b>All her foes. </b>We were the angels; even they turned into enemies for her, as our sages said in the Midrash that even Michael, who constantly advocates for the merit of Israel, can sometimes become an adversary.
