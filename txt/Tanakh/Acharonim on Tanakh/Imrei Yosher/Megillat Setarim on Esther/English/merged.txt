<b>[To fulfill (<i>lekayem</i>)] these days of Purim in their times, as instituted (<i>kiyem</i>) by Modekhai and Esther]</b> He warned that the Jews fulfill them in their times, even though they did not see the miracle, in the same way as Mordekhai and Esther fulfilled them when they saw the miracle that came through them - as it was certainly with great joy and light-heartedness. 'And to take it upon themselves and upon their offspring,' in the same way as they swore about and fulfilled doing so themselves.
<b>the words of the fasts and their outcries:</b> This does not refer to what is above. For behold they did not fulfill the fasts over [the miracles]. Rather it refers to what is below, meaning about the words of the fasts and outcries...
<b>And the word of Esther</b> caused the fulfillment of these matters of Purim. And the intention of "the word of Esther" is that which she said to accept the fasts, or that which she said to the king.
