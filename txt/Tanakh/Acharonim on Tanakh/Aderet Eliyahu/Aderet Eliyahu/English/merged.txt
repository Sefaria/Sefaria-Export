Verse 6


The firmament is a half-sphere filled with the lower waters. "And there was a division between the waters, between the upper waters," which is the upper half-sphere. Regarding the waters, it is a half-sphere, from the lower waters, and the separation itself is what our Sages of blessed memory referred to as "like the interlocking parts of a puzzle." This is what it is.  The sky is called "fargod" because it includes the sky called "vilon" and it rolls like a curtain. This is what I heard from behind the fargod. Those who dwell in the air under the stars are subject to their authority, and our sages of blessed memory said that the sky, which was created on the second day, was made of fire above and water below. The philosophers do not know which are the upper waters that are above it. The ones who follow them mistakenly attribute the order of the four elements to "ARaG'M" (earth, air, water, and fire), but the sense testifies that it is "ARaMaG" (air, water, earth, and fire), as I explained in my book. The sky is like a half-sphere hollowed out inside upper waters, as it says in the Beraisa of Samuel, and it reaches down to the lower waters, which is the ocean, as the waters flow to one place, which is the ocean. The celestial spheres move in the sky until they reach the ocean, and then they move in the ocean. It was said in Perek Shirah that at night the sun moves in the ocean, and this sky moves only in the upper waters. The waters on which it moves reach down to the lower waters, where they connect together, and this is what it says, "And there was a separation between the waters and the waters." Our sages of blessed memory said that the sky is like two crowns pressed against each other like two halves of a sphere, with only a little air separating them. This is what they meant when they said that the upper heavens depend on the word of God.

Verse 3

[...] "from all His work that God created to do/make." The explanation of this is that "to do/make" refers to the future. That is that the Holy-One-blessed-be-He renews every day anew the work of creation. And the renewal of the work of creation on the Sabbath day is prepared on the day before and on the Sabbath He refrains from that too; and that is the meaning of what is said "from all."

"And the sister of Tuval-Cain was Naamah." She was known in the days of Moshe our teacher and the Israelites, and thus it says (Genesis 36:22) "And the sister of Lotan was Timna," because she was famous. Know that all of these were wiped out and turned into demons, and were well-known, and it is not my desire to discuss this at length, therefore I am writing here.

<b>God compassionate and gracious:</b> For forgiveness and mercy is in His hands. And all of this was in the later forty days. And these are all the prayers that he [prayed] during all of these forty days - to bring back His Divine Presence amongst us as at first when He told him [about] the creation of the Tabernacle in order that, 'I will dwell amongst you." But they lost [this]. However now [Moshe] did not desist until he brought the Divine Presence to dwell [with them]. So he stated the section, "And he said [...], 'Behold, You'" (Exodus 33:12), before, "Hew for yourself" (Deuteronomy 10:1), for there is no chronological order [in the Torah]. So that [section from Exodus] should be made adjacent to the verse, "I will not go up among you" (Exodus 33:3). This means that [first] He returned and was appeased as before; and then it states that He descended in a cloud, "And He passed before his face."

Verse 1

In the wilderness of Sinai. Because these two sections were said to him in the wilderness of Sinai within a span of thirty days, therefore it is written here "In the wilderness of Sinai." See Ramban, of blessed memory.

Verse: "By way of a hint: I will speak with him (Moshe) face to face, openly and not in riddles." Commentary: "For the Nukva is located in the middle line, and the name 'Hashem' is given to her in the aspects of Aleph(one) in the crown, Aleph in the foundation, Aleph in Tiferet, Aleph in Da'at, and Aleph in the aspect of a distinct face. It is known that the Patriarchs were in the aspect of "shuruk katan", and their root was in the aspect of cholam, shuruk and chirik (vowelization points). The meaning is that 'Keter Ehad' (the supernal crown) cleaved to the Shekhinah, and this is the aspect of the men who belonged to 'Keter Ehad.' Abraham took the lower aspect in the crown, which is called 'Sihara,' as known, and it is called 'Sihara Tzedek.'                         Isaia 41:2:  "Who has roused a victor from the East, summoned him to G-d’s service?" as it is written: Exodus 24:10 "and they saw the G-d of Israel; under whose feet was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire". Therefore, the Sihara is called 'Lavana' (moon) - the attribute of chessed/kindness. Therefore "mountain" is the secret of the apple, as known. Isaac took the aspect of Yesod, and he is called 'Yitzhak Ketz Chai' (Isaac, the end of life), as it is written in  Tikunei Zohar Chadash 98: 'Yitzhak Ketz Chai Olamin (Isaac, the end of life of the worlds).' It is tied with the left. There he is called 'field' and is connected to Nun-Heh-Yod (Netzach Hod Yesod) as is known and this is the meaning of "field that is abandoned and plowed" like it says: Genesis 47:23: "here is seed for you to sow the land" and Genesis 47:19: "and that the land may not become a waste.” Jacob took the aspect of Tav Tav (Tiferet) meaning 'Bayit' (house) like: Yeshayahu  47:13 As a man's glory to sit in a house. As our Sages said, ' From (all) my days, I have not called my wife, my wife,' etc. For in the aspect of field is nothing, except when it is given over to be plowed, unlike a house, where a person is always present. And this is the aspect of Yesod and Tiferet, which is called 'Ish' (man), and Tiferet is called 'Adam.' This is the secret of 'and no man passed there, and no man dwelled there.' Here he passed (field), and here he dwelled (house), and they are the general principle of all, like the three aforementioned points. They are the general principle and the general body: head, abdomen, and body. They are the general principle of NR"N (Nefesh-Ruach-Neshamah), and likewise all the principles of the Merkavah (Divine Chariot) and the general principle of the Ten Sefirot, as known. And this is in the external aspect, and it is known that Da'at includes Chessed and Gevurah, graces/sefirot, that draw from the small face. And this is Kel De'ot (G-d of knowledge), the secret of the knowledge of Z"A (Zeir Anpin). And Moshe is the "principle" of da'at, awesome and holy and that is the "bridal aspect" of Moshe Rabbeinu and this is the meaning that Jakob served with his body and Moshe served with his spirituality for da'at is the inner fragrance and therefore he (Moshe) separated from his wife for he served with his mind/spirit, and this is the secret of the union of kisses, which is the voice and speech, and the hidden knowledge in the mouth, as stated in Perek Mishpatim (Chapter on Laws). And this is what it means, 'Face to face, I will speak with him,' and in the fifth aspect, which is the face. This is the second of the lights that diminished, as it said, "aleph" immediately followed "tav" on the fourth day when the lights were diminished.' And she descended into "beriya", and this is ' HeshemElokeinu.' And this is with Z"A (Zeir Anpin), and makes it a complete Name, and it is the aspect of Judah. And David is the fourth leg to the forefathers, as they brought him to their level, which is HG"T (Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet), and this is the fourth leg. And this is what is meant by 'Judah descended,' as known. And this is 'Avnei Ma'asu Habonim' (the stone the builders rejected), and it is the supernal Malchut (kingdom) of the ten s'firot, as known. And this full name will ascend in the future, and this is what 'shall be the cornerstone' means."

<b>Blinds the eyes of the wise [<i>chachamim</i>]:</b> Yet in <i>Shemos </i>(23:8) the parallel verse states, “Blind the eyes of the <i>pikchim</i>. The word “wise” means wise in Torah. <i>Pikchim</i> means in worldly affairs, so that they will be able to cross-examine the witnesses. A judge must be proficient in both types of knowledge.
