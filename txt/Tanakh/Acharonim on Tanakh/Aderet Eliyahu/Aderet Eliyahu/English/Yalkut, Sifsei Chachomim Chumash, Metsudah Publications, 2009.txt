<b>Blinds the eyes of the wise [<i>chachamim</i>]:</b> Yet in <i>Shemos </i>(23:8) the parallel verse states, “Blind the eyes of the <i>pikchim</i>. The word “wise” means wise in Torah. <i>Pikchim</i> means in worldly affairs, so that they will be able to cross-examine the witnesses. A judge must be proficient in both types of knowledge.
