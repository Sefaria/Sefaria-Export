Verse 28

<b>Elokim blessed them.</b> He blessed them that the human species would never disappear. Nevertheless, He also commanded them to reproduce, lest they neglect to do their share to ensure their survival. This command was also necessary lest someone claim that his siblings were doing enough to continue the species or that he had already done his share.

Verse 29

<b>I have given you.</b> The principle benefit of making human beings the masters of the earth was that they were able to take from it their sustenance. Over living creatures, however, they were initially granted mastery alone, but not the right to take them for food.

Verse 16

<b>Saying (literally, “to say”).</b> Hashem told Adam to relay the command to his future wife. <b>You may certainly eat (<i>achol tocheil</i>).</b> This can also be rendered, “you may eat and <i>she</i> may eat,” referring again to Chavah. Similarly, the phrase “you will certainly die” (<i>mos tamus</i>) can be rendered, “you will die and <i>she</i> will die.” Alternatively, these phrases can be understood, “you and all your descendants may eat,” and if you transgress, “you and all your descendants will die!”.

Verse 6

<b>Noach opened.</b> Noach knew that it was now safe to open the window because he had been promised that the flood would not last longer than twelve months. Moreover, he had been instructed to take with him only a limited amount of provisions.

Verse 7

Verse 9

<b>He put out his hand.</b> He was concerned the dove would be so exhausted from continuous flying that it would fall into the sea.

Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>Every moving creature.</b> They were permitted to Noach for three reasons: 1) They were only saved in his merit. 2) He labored on their behalf in the ark. And 3) Hashem only foreswore destroying them in the future on account of Noach’s sacrifices.

<b>I will keep My covenant.</b> He will never again destroy the entire world by flood but He may destroy a part of it. <b>Will flood waters destroy the earth.</b> Even if part of the world is inundated, the ground itself will not be damaged.

Verse 4


<b>Avram went as (or “when”) Ad-noy had told him.</b> He did not delay for a moment but immediately set out to fulfill God’s command. <b>And Lot went with him.</b> Lot went along only to be near Avraham, not to fulfill God’s will. Part of Avraham’s intention in setting out so swiftly was to prevent others from accompanying him but he was unsuccessful in dissuading Lot.

<b>As he came near.</b> Concerned that Sarah would ask why he had brought her to a place of danger, Avraham apologized in advance that he did not realize the peril until now.

Chapter 14



Chapter 15



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3


<b>Behold, You have not given me.</b> Literally, “For <i>me</i> You have not given children” — i.e. “fitting for me.” Avraham thought that God’s earlier promise of offspring like “the dust of the earth” (13:16) meant that they would be lowly people. God replied that they would in fact be comparable to the stars (v. 5), after which Avraham understood that the metaphor of dust was also a positive one. 
<b>Eliezer of Damascus.</b> As long as Avraham thought that his descendants were to be lowly he preferred leaving everything to his disciple.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>I have given.</b> This is in the past tense to indicate that since Avram had already made an initial acquisition of the land his children would receive it through inheritance. 
It is clear that the complete fulfillment of this gift lies in the future because at the time of the original conquest they received the domains of only seven of the ten Canaanite nations.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>Let a bit of water be brought.</b> Although he knew they were angels he did not wish to deviate from the usual custom.  <b>A bit.</b> Avraham played down the effort he made for his guests in order not to embarrass them.

Chapter 19



Verse 1

<b>In the evening.</b> If they had come in the daytime the townspeople might have prevented Lot from receiving them. Although Lot was saved primarily in Avraham’s merit (v. 29), they wanted him to acquire some merit of his own through welcoming them.

Chapter 20



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>Behold you shall die.</b> If Hashem had not warned him he would not have been killed because a Noachide who has relations with a married woman whom he mistakenly believes to be single is absolved.

Verse 18

<b>For Ad-noy had restrained … .because of Sarah.</b> Avraham’s prayer enabled Sarah to conceive as well, in keeping with the principle that when a person prays for his fellow he is answered first.

Chapter 21



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>She conceived.</b> Literally, “became pregnant” — the pregnancy was also miraculous because she lacked a womb. <b>To Avraham’s son.</b> This was Avraham’s real son, not Yishmael, in keeping with 21:12. In 16:15, by contrast, it is written, “Hagar bore Av<i>ram</i> a son,” not Avra<i>ham</i>. Thus it is forbidden to call Avraham — “Avram,” because by doing so one implies that Yismael is also his son.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>On account of his son.</b> He was concerned that he would fall into evil and idolatrous ways.  
He was also upset that Sarah spoke as if Yishmael was only Hagar’s son, but in the next verse Hashem justifies Sarah’s words.

<b>I do not know.</b> He admitted knowledge of the crime but not its perpetrators. <b>You also never told me.</b> Anticipating that Avraham would ask why he did not investigate the matter, he argued that Avraham was also negligent for not complaining.

Chapter 22



Chapter 23



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>From the presence of his dead.</b> Literally, “from the <i>face</i> of his dead.” Until the grave has been sealed the deceased is aware of all that takes place before him. For this reason the body is always placed face up.

Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>Whose daughter are you.</b> He was only asking her father’s name, because he was already certain she was from Avraham’s family. <b>Is there place.</b> If he had not known that she was from Avraham’s family he would not have asked this question before hearing the answer to his first one.

Verse 20


<b>The daughter of Besueil.</b> Rivkah’s parentage is mentioned to explain why Hashem answered Yitzchak’s prayers rather than hers (next verse), lest one suspect that it was because she was unworthy. 
 
<b>Sister of Lavan.</b> This is mentioned to reveal why she was barren — i.e. so that no one would imagine that Lavan’s blessing (24:60) was of any benefit.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23


<b>The greater … the smaller.</b> These designations would be exchanged several times in the course of history. <b>The greater one will serve.</b> Not only would one of them ascend through the downfall of the other, but the fallen one would then be subservient to the ascendant one.

<b>It was (<i>Vayehi</i>) when Yitzchok had finished.</b> According to the Sages the word <i>vayehi</i> always portends tragedy (<i>vay hi</i> — “it is a woe”). If Yitzchok had not finished blessing Yaakov when he did, but gave him the blessings that he subsequently gave to Eisov as well, Eisov’s descendants would have had no dominion in the world.

<b>Behold Rochel his daughter.</b> Although he was well in other respects, his modest means were evident from the fact that his young daughter tended the flocks and that they were so few that she could do so alone.

<b>[Yaakov] told Lavan all that had happened.</b> After Rochel warned him of her father’s trickery he tried to forestall it by relating his own cunning in acquiring the birthright and blessings and strength in moving the stone, and on the other hand, the affection he had shown him by watering his flocks.

Chapter 41



Verse 1

<b>It was at the end (<i>Vayehi mikeitz</i>).</b> According to the Sages <i>vayehi</i> always betokens some sorrowful circumstance (<i>vay hi</i> — “it is a woe”) — in this case the sorrow of the extra two years that Yoseif remained in prison as well as the sorrow of the impending famine.

<b>Behold it was a dream.</b> It was so realistic that he did not recognize that it was a dream until he arose.

<b>None could interpret them for Pharaoh.</b> The wise men gave numerous interpretations, but they were not appropriate <i>for Pharaoh</i> — he knew that a king’s dreams should reveal matters relating to his entire realm.

<b>As for the dream being repeated (<i>hishanos</i>).</b> <i>Hishanos</i> can also mean to “be altered” — thus the dream was repeated but in a different form. 
<b>God is hurrying to do it.</b> The repetition in a single night rather than on separate occasions indicated its imminency.

Chapter 45



Verse 1


<b>I am Yoseif your brother.</b> When they did not respond the first time he said this, he was uncertain whether it was out of fear or disbelief. In case it was fear, he reassured them that he was still their brother. And in case it was out of doubt he added, “whom you sold,” a fact that only the real Yoseif could have known.

<b>Yehudah (literally, “<i>You</i>, Yehudah”).</b> Unlike the blessings of the others brothers, which applied only to their distant descendants, this one applied to Yehudah himself. <b>Your hand will be on the neck.</b> Nevertheless, the other tribes would only prostrate themselves before his descendant David after his victory over Golyas; see I <i>Shemuel</i> 17.

<b>A fruitful son.</b> The repetition of this phrase indicates that he was worthy of fruitfulness both by birth and in the merit of his restraint.
<b>Daughters tread on the wall.</b> Alternatively, “Daughters [encircled] like a bracelet in order to gaze” — Potiphar’s wife gathered all the noble women of Egypt and then ordered Yoseif to serve them. Because he restrained himself from looking at them he merited protection from the evil eye (reading “at the well” as “above the [evil] eye”).

<b>With his own unique blessing.</b> Through Divine inspiration Yaakov blessed each one in accordance with the unique potential of his soul and in accordance with his deeds.
<b>He blessed <i>them</i>.</b> Although it is written “with <i>his</i> … blessing” — in the singular — the plural is used here to indicate that each one’s blessing was of benefit to the others as well.

Verse 29

<b>He commanded them.</b> Although he had already made Yoseif take an oath regarding his burial arrangements he did not want them to suppose that the obligation was upon him alone.

Chapter 50



Verse 1

<b>And kissed him.</b> Ordinarily the impurity of the corpse would be injurious to the one who kissed it. Yaakov, however, did not die in the usual sense; he merely entered a kind of sleep.

<b>Am I in place of Elokim.</b> It is for the True Judge to decide whether you are deserving of punishment, but I seek no vengeance.

Verse 20

<b>He comforted them.</b> He did not forgive them explicitly because under Noachide law forgiveness does not commute punishment and even under Torah law forgiveness does not exempt a kidnapper from death. He did, however, present an argument for their acquittal — the fact that Hashem transformed their deed for the good.
