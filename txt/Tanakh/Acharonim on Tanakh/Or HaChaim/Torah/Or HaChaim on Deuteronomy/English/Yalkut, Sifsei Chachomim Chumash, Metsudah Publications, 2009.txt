<b>Your returned and wept.</b> It seems that the meaning of this verse is that after the Emorites attacked you were humbled before Hashem and returned to him in repentance and tears for the sin, as appropriate for penitents. Nevertheless their stench was too great and Hashem did not accept their repentance and did not listen to their tears.

<b>See with your own eyes.</b> Hashem meant to say to him, that what he asked, to see the land by entering it, when he said, “Allow me to cross over and see the good land,” will be done miraculously, and he will see with his eyes without having to travel, everything that he wanted to see. This is something which would be impossible for any other eye to see, and this is why the verse specifies, “With your own eyes.”

<b>Yet Hashem grew angry at me.</b> Moshe repeated this statement… to say that there was another decree against him, not only that he would die in the desert, but also that his bones would not be brought for burial in the Land of Israel. Unlike the bones of Yosef and the other tribal founders, whose bones were carried by the Jewish people through the desert for burial in Israel. This is what Moshe meant when he said that Hashem told him, “I would not cross the Jordan,” in my lifetime, and I “would not enter the good land,” even after my death … Moshe said that this was, “On account of your statements” as our Sages say: It is analogous to a person who lost some coins, and scattered amongst them was a golden dinar … Similarly, When Moshe will arise, at the time of the resurrection, he will bring all of the generation who died in the desert with him. He brought them out of Egypt and he will bring them out of the desert and bring the to the World to Come, the future world with the righteous … Were it not for this reason, that Moshe has to lead these people to the World to Come, Hashem would not have sworn that even his bones would be unable to enter the Land of Israel.

<b>And now Yisroel.</b> There are two levels which Hashem desires the Jewish people to attain, one above the other. The first is fear, and above that is love. Moseh said to them that all that Hashem is asking of them is to fear Him. The reason for this is that fear will direct you to follow in His ways. One who is afraid will not leave out even one thousandth of the thing that he must do. However this is not the ultimate goal, because one must also love Hashem. Fear is the doorway to enter the gate of love. Therefore, when the verse states, “What is Hashem, your God, asking of you, other than to fear Hashem, your God” it specifically begins with “And now”. In other words, Hashem asks Yisroel to fear Him now, at this time, when you accept the yoke of His Kingship. But this is not the goal that He desires for you. Rather the ultimate goal is to love Hashem. This explains the statement of our Sages: That for Moshe, fear was something minor, (Megillah 25a) because he was already at the level of loving Hashem.

<b>The blessing, that you heed.</b> This can be explained by the statement of our Sages, that every positive act has both a principle and interest… This verse does not mention action or refraining from action, for to anyone who hears the words of the Living God, the Torah improves his soul and straightens him. For Torah is the elixir of life, as our Sages have said: The light within it will return them to the good (Introduction to Eicha Rabba). Therefore the verse says that everything depends on listening.

Verse 28

<b>And the curse, if you do not heed.</b> This means that anyone who refrains from listening to the Torah is cursed by himself. Thus, “The curse, if you do not heed” is itself the curse.

<b>And grant you mercy.</b> This means that since Hashem commanded to kill the entire city of a city of idolatrous Jews, including even their animals, this may lead to cruelty in a person’s nature, as the Yishmaelim have told us, that they have a group who kill at the instruction of the king. They have a great desire when they are killing a person, and they destroy any feeling of mercy from them and become cruel. This aspect could become rooted within those who execute the people of the idolatrous city. Therefore Hashem promised them that He will give them mercy, even though nature would normally make them cruel. The Source of mercy will grant them renewed mercy, to remove the cruelty that their actions created.

<b>If there should be someone destitute.</b> The reason that Hashem chooses to afflict someone in this world with poverty is so that through him others can merit to provide for him, and this is the allusion in the verse, “in your midst”, meaning that the poverty comes to him due to you.

<b>This very day.</b> Was it today that he commanded them? Hashem commanded them forty years earlier at Mount Sinai. Rashi explains that this means that every day the mitzvos should appear new in your eyes. It seems that the intention of the verse is along these lines, because all of the Torah was commanded by Hashem at Mount Sinai. This includes mitzvos that applied at that time, and mitzvos that only applied later, like those mentioned here, the mitzvos of first fruits and tithes which do not apply outside the land of Israel. Hashem commanded them even though they were not relevant at that time in order to learn the mitzvos and receive the reward for accepting them. Moshe said to the people that this day he commands them to observe all of the statutes, which include first fruits and tithes, for until tis day they were only commanded to learn their laws. From this very day they are commanded to preform them for they have arrived at the border of the land of Israel. The word “today” has an extended meaning of “very soon”.

<b>Cursed is whoever reviles his father.</b> Why were these sins singled out of all the mitzvos to have the curse apply to them? Similarly, in the sins of sexual immorality, why were these particular sins mentioned for the curse, when all the sins of sexual immorality are equally severe. Perhaps here it only lists the hidden and concealed sins, which is why the section begins wit the words, “And places it in a secret place” If someone sins in public, all of Yisroel are liable because they are responsible for one another. Similarly, the phrase, “Whoever reviles his father or mother” refers to a case which is not punishable by the court. Similarly one who casts aside the boundary of another when nobody sees… and one who takes a bribe. The reason that one who lies with an animal is listed between the curses of one who lies with his father’s wife and one who lies with his sister is to teach that incest is as repugnant to human nature as lying with an animal.

Verse 15

<b>Should you not obey Hashem, your God.</b> The verse made this contingent upon three aspects; Torah study, observance of prohibitions, and fulfillment of positive mitzvos. They must all three be observed. This means that even if one has learned Torah, if he does not observe the mitzvos, or if he avoids the prohibitions but does not fulfil the positive mitzvos, or if he keeps both positive mitzvos and avoids prohibitions but does not learn Torah, these curses will befall him — may Hashem save us. When he explains what is relevant to each of these, the punishment of each by itself, and beings with the punishment of not learning Torah, and says, “Cursed are you in the city” until “until you are destroyed and until you are swiftly removed because of the wickedness of your deeds in that you forsook Me” this means that until now everything has been speaking about the sin of abandoning the Torah. For one who abandons the Torah is like one who abandons Hashem. Similarly you will find that Hashem was the most strict about abandoning Torah, and said, “Why was the land lost? And Hashem said, For they abandoned my Torah” (Yirmiyahu 9:11-12). This is the meaning here when it states, “Until you are swiftly removed because of the wickedness of your deeds in that you forsook Me.”.

<b>Blows, great and dependable.</b> The verse states that they are dependable, which means that even though there were natural remedies for such blows, these blows were dependable in their task, and from them there was no cure until Hashem removed them.

Destructiveness does not affect Him. When they are destructive they cause evil to themselves. What evil do they cause? <b>It is not his children.</b> Meaning that they are no longer called the children of the Living God. As our Sages say: When the Jews follow the way of Hashem they are called His children. When they do not follow His way, they are called servants… <b>Their defect.</b> Since one could say that eventually the defect of the children will reach to, and affect, the father (Heaven forbid). For this reason it states, “Their defect,” the defect comes from them and not from their Father, for He created mankind upright.
