<b>All who go forth into the army</b>. Scripture uses this expression in every detail of the counting to inform that everyone who was numbered was worthy of going out with the army. All of them were mighty men of strength. This is why it says “all” — meaning, each one of them was capable of going forth into the army. This is a miracle not found among the gentile nations, for most certainly someone who is not fitting for the army will be found among all their numbers.

<b>I am Hashem</b>.

This is the meaning of what is said, “and the Levites shall be Mine, I am Hashem,” just as My Name is Eternal, so too, the Levites shall be Mine eternally.

<b>They counted — Moshe, Aharon and the leaders of the congregation.</b> These three were in charge of the counting for the following reasons: Moshe was the messenger of Hashem; the Levites were under the responsibility of Aharon, as it says, “they are presented to him” (3:9); and the leaders of the congregation gave over the Levites to serve in their place, as it says, “they shall take care to preserve his guardianship and the guardianship of the entire congregation” (3:7). All three were not mentioned in the count of Levites from one month and over, because that counting was according to the word of Hashem, for that count included babies as well, as the Sages said, “A Heavenly Voice would proclaim: In this tent there are such and such.” Therefore, only Moshe, Hashem’s prophet, was mentioned there.

<b>May Hashem bless you and protect you.</b> The blessing comes first and afterwards the protection, to teach that Hashem will protect you to the value and extent of the blessing. Another explanation is that the blessing will be so great that Hashem will have to protect you. Furthermore, it means that it will only be a blessing and no evil will befall you from the blessing, as it says, “Lest you eat and be satisfied… [and you forget Hashem, your God] (Devarim 8:12-14).

<b>The leaders brought forward.</b> This was stated a second time to teach that they busied themselves in bringing the gift to the Mishkon although they were leaders. They were not afraid of a slight to their honor.

Verse 11



Verse 12


<b>Of the tribe of Yehudah.</b> He was not called a leader as it was stated by all the other tribes to teach that Nachshon was worthy to bring the offering first even if he was not a leader, due to his own virtue. This was not so regarding the other leaders, however, because their virtue was only due to their being the leader of the tribe. Furthermore, the Torah wished to stress his character, for Nachshon considered himself only as one of his tribe and not as a leader.

<b>On the second day.</b> The tribe of Yissachar was given precedence because they were Torah scholars, so their tribe was elevated and came before Reuven the first-born. Not only that, but Zevulun, who supported them in their Torah study, as it says: “Rejoice Zevulun at your departure, and Yissachar in your tents,” was elevated due to Yissachar and also preceded Reuven.

<b>Eliav the son of Cheilon.</b> This was his name because he supported Yissachar in Torah study, and so he is called father (אב). We also find that Moshe gave precedence to Zevulun before Yissachar, as it says: “Rejoice Zevulun at your departure, and Yissachar in your tents.” The name Eliav denotes: To me (אלי) he has the relationship of a father (אב), although he is secular (חילון), i.e., although he is not a Torah scholar and is occupied with secular, worldly business dealings, nonetheless, he has the status of a father to the king.

Moreover, he was judged (דן) that his kingdom would be cut off (לגדוע=גדעוני), as it says, “Hashem has torn the kingdom of Israel from you” (Shmuel I 15:28). It also hints at Mordechai who destroyed (אבד) the seed of Amalek, ben Gidoni, the son of the one who caused that Shaul’s kingdom be cut off from him.

<b>Given by the leaders of Israel.</b> This extra verse praises them that they voluntarily inaugurated the Altar. This is implied by the language מאת, meaning, the deed was from them (מאתם), and they needed no outside encouragement. The Sages said that it teaches that they were all equivalent in one mitzvah and one merit. When the Sages said, “one merit” they were referring to the offerings mentioned here, but in fact they were on different levels, one higher than the other, and Nachshon was the greatest.

<b>It will be… it will be</b>. Why does the verse repeat the phrase, “it will be”? This can be explained according to the view of Rabbi Eliezer who said that Yisro wanted to leave and return later. Moshe told him it was not right to leave and return, because he wanted Yisro to be present when Hashem would grant the inheritance to His people, so they could give him a good portion. If Yisro would not be there at the time of dividing the Land, this would not be possible. Yisro agreed, but later when he saw that Hashem decreed that Bnei Yisroel would have to be in the Wilderness for forty years, he went back to his home with the intention of converting his village. He returned, and was present when Hashem granted the inheritance to Bnei Yisroel. According to Rabbi Yehoshua, on the other hand, Moshe intended to tell Yisro that he should not see himself as lower than the Bnei Yisroel since he was a proselyte, as he said, “But rather to my land and to my birthplace will I go.” This shows that he wished to go home where he had acquaintances. Moshe told him otherwise: “It shall be that the very good which Hashem will bestow on us” — i.e., you will be together with us and the Jewish people will not consider you on a lower level. Moreover, you will have the best and choicest portion, as it says, “We will bestow on you”.

<b>These are the names.</b> This is explained by our Sages: Rabbi Yitzchak said: This matter we have as a tradition from our forefathers, the spies were named after their deeds: Sesur the son of Michael — He contradicted (סתר) Hashem’s words… One might ask: Why did Moshe see fit to pray for Yehoshua? The Torah first wrote the names of the spies to answer this question. Moshe grasped the evil deeds of the spies from their names, and for this reason he knew he had to pray for Yehoshua … 
Moshe gave Yehoshua strength when he added the letter <i>yud</i> to his name. <i>Yud</i> equals ten, so he could prevail over the ten spies. Furthermore, Yehoshua would take the merit and good portion of all ten of them, as the Sages said: If he merits, he takes his portion and the portion of his fellow man.

<b>They recounted to him.</b> The Torah was exact in writing “to him” because they spoke exclusively to Moshe, but their statements were intended for the entire congregation and not for Moshe alone, and that is why the verse continues: And they said — and did not write “to him.” 
We came into the land. We came there without harm and we had no mishaps. Into which you sent us. We were protected from harm because we fulfilled your command in sending us. Another reason: Moshe accompanied them as he sent them and so they were protected from harm when they came into the land.

<b>I have forgiven them as you spoke.</b> Hashem did not forgive the sin entirely. Rather, “as you spoke” — I will not kill them, in accordance with Moshe’s pleas, so that the nations will not say it was because of Hashem’s inability to bring them to the land that He killed them. However, Hashem said He would judge them with slowness to anger.

Rather, they shall fall in the desert.

<b>And Hashem spoke to Moshe.</b> In the entire Torah when it says, “And Hashem spoke to Moshe” it uses the language וידבר, so why in this parshah does it say ויאמר? The answer is based on a statement of the Sages: When Moshe saw the deed of the wood-gatherer he said to Hashem: On a weekday the Bnei Yisroel wear tefillin and they remember the commandments, how will they remember on Shabbos? Hashem answered: I will give them the commandment of <i>tzitzis</i> with which they will remember. That is why it says ויאמר, which means a statement that satisfies someone’s request.

<b>Two hundred and fifty … and you and Aharon.</b> This is superfluous. It could be that Moshe, in his wisdom, declared that Korach should be combined with Aharon and not with the two hundred and fifty men. Moshe did this so there would be no margin for error for anyone following Korach to claim that evil befell him because he was with so many others who were offering incense. However, if he had been alone, he would have been equal to Aharon. Therefore, Moshe said <b>and you and Aharon</b> — by yourselves — <b>will each take his own firepan.</b> Even though everyone brought the incense together, nevertheless, there were two groups — one group was Korach and Aharon, and the second group was the two hundred and fifty men.

<b>Moshe rose up.</b> This can be explained on the basis of the verse (Mishlei 16:18): “Before destruction comes pride” and (ibid. 18:12), “but before honor there is humility.” The Sages said (Shemos Rabbah 45:5): I humiliate and I raise up. Thus, we can explain the verse: Moshe rose up — he was elevated because he went to Dasan and Aviram, the evil men who cursed him and refused to come to him. Still, he lowered himself and went to them. About them it says, “Before destruction comes pride,” whereas about Moshe it says, “But before honor there is humility”.

<b>Aharon took, just as Moshe spoke.</b> This comes to emphasize that Aharon took the incense immediately after Moshe spoke, and did not delay even a moment. Furthermore, this phrase is needed because what Aharon did — offering incense outside of its time and outside of its place — was the opposite of the law. Therefore it says, “Aharon took” — the reason he did so is because it was “just as Moshe spoke.” That is, it was according to the word of a prophet, and a prophet is believed in the case of transgressing one of the commandments on a temporary basis, as Eliyahu on Mount Carmel (Melachim I 18:21-39).

<b>It shall be that the man whom I choose.</b> Wasn’t everything that Hashem did with Korach enough? The answer is that they thought that what happened to Korach was because he spoke against Moshe and disputed with him, and Hashem took revenge for His prophet’s honor. However, it was still possible He would choose one of the other tribes to serve Him, and therefore Hashem commanded them to perform the test of the staffs.

Verse 20

<b>You will have no inheritance in their land.</b> In the Sifrei it says: This prohibits Aharon from having a portion in the land and a portion in spoils, and that is why the verse uses a double language, “You will have no inheritance in their land, and you will not have a share among them.” This is needed because one might think that Hashem only intended to exempt Bnei Yisroel from giving Aharon a portion, but if they wanted to give to him it would be praiseworthy. Therefore it says, “You will have no inheritance” — it is prohibited. One might have thought that only an inheritance is prohibited, but a portion of spoils would not be prohibited, therefore the Torah says, “and you will not have a share among them.” It says specifically, “among them,” similar to the verse (Mishlei 1:14): “Cast your lot among us,” which means, to take a portion as one of them is prohibited, but if they want to send him presents he may accept from them.

<b>Since it is the reward for your service.</b> Why is the Torah repeating the words it stated earlier (v. 21): “in return for their service which they perform”? The answer is because it said: You may consume it anywhere, for it is completely secular. Therefore the Torah explains why: This tithe has no holiness, such as <i>terumah</i>. It is intended to be reward for your service, and therefore it is secular property with no holiness. 
The Sages said (Sifrei 122) that the verse teaches that if the Levite served he may take but if he did not serve he may not take. From here they derived that if a Levite accepted upon himself all the services except for one he has no portion in the Levite service. And “both these and these are the words of the Living God”.

<b>Moshe prayed.</b> He prayed for forgiveness of the sin. However, forgiveness for sin after the punishment has begun is not the same as forgiveness beforehand. After it has begun, even if the sin is forgiven, still, they needed a merit to remove the destroyer, as the Sages taught: A person should always seek mercy before he becomes sick, because if he becomes sick, he needs a merit to be healed. For this reason, the Generation of Knowledge applied their wisdom and said, “Pray to Adonoy that He <i>remove</i>” — corresponding to the need for merit to be saved from the snakes, Moshe should also pray that in his merit Hashem will remove them.

<b>A nation came out.</b> This can be explained according to our Sages who said, Pharaoh had three advisors when he said about Yisroel, 'Come let us deal wisely with him.' One of them was Bil'am who advised to do evil to them. Bil'am used black magic to prevent any slave from escaping Egypt. He was certain that the Nation of Israel would never escape. Therefore, Balak sent a message to Bil'am, Behold, a nation came out of Egypt. In other words, reality has changed and all black magic has been nullified. Perhaps Bil'am had promised Balak that Israel would never escape. Therefore, Balak said to him, Behold, they came out. Furthermore, the emissaries said, Behold they have covered the face of the earth. Their intention here was also to contradict what Bil'am had advised in his evil plan to afflict Israel, to reduce them in number and to kill their males. Behold, the opposite is true. Not only have they not been reduced but, to the contrary, they have multiplied exceedingly. Therefore, Balak said, Behold they have covered the face of the earth.

<b>The donkey saw</b> …it seems that Hashem's whole intention in this matter was to subdue the arrogance of this despicable person because from the very beginning he conducted himself with arrogance before Hashem… He did not say to the dignitaries that he is under Hashem's control. Instead, he presented himself as a person who is free to do as he chooses. Therefore, Hashem sought to humiliate him in a way that surpasses all other human degradation; Hashem made a mockery of him in an extreme and unusual manner.

Verse 36

<b>To the city of Moav.</b> It seems that this verse is coming to relate how unimportant Bil'am was in Balak's eyes. Although Balak heard that Bil'am was approaching, he did not go outside the city to greet him, as is expected when greeting a distinguished person. Rather, Balak deliberately greeted him within the city as the verse says he went out to meet him, to the city of Moav, which is on the boundary of Arnon — at the very edge of the boundary. 
Furthermore, the verse emphasizes at the very edge of the boundary. The intention of this phrase, perhaps, is to say that even Balak's small effort to greet Bil'am was not in order to honor him, but rather it was for another reason, as the Sages said: For what reason did Balak go out to meet Bil'am at the boundary? Balak was hinting to him, 'These boundaries have been set in place since the days of Noach so that no nation should invade the boundary of another.' Balak showed Bil'am how he had broken through the boundaries of Sichon and Og. If not for this reason, Balak would not have left from his place.

Verse 37



Verse 38



Verse 39

<b>Bil’am went.</b> This verse implies that Balak did not treat Bil'am with honor. Rather, Balak walked ahead and Bil'am followed behind him. For this reason the verse does not say [the plural verb form] וילכו (they went). Perhaps when Balak heard Bil'am say that he is unable to do anything, he turned around and left him. Bil'am, however, followed after him. Therefore, the verse says [in the singular verb form] that Bil'am went (וילך) with Balak.

Verse 40

<b>Balak slaughtered.</b> This verse also intends to make known to us the extent of Bil'am's disgrace. For Balak did not consider eating with him even the first meal. Rather, he sent food to him and to the dignitaries etc. Perhaps Balak was particular to mention the dignitaries that were with him. For he sent only enough food for Bil'am and the dignitaries that he knew were with him, which was the portion for his attendants. This demonstrates how reluctant Balak was to give honor to Bil'am. Alternatively, Balak thought that Bil'am would take everything he sent for himself and not give any to the dignitaries; he knew that Bil'am had an evil eye. Therefore, when he sent food he specified that it is not only for Bil'am, but also for the dignitaries.

Verse 41

<b>In the morning.</b> The Sages comment that ויהי implies suffering…
It could be explained that [Balak intended to cause him pain] since Bil'am was lame and, according to human physiology, such a person's leg would not be in condition for walking in the morning. Additionally, and he led him up to Bamos Ba’al is perhaps what the word ויהי is referring to. It implies, Woe to Bil'am! Since he was unable to start walking immediately, Balak grabbed him and supported him to lead him up. That is the significance of Balak took Bil’am and he led him up to Bamos Ba’al.

<b>And saw.</b> He saw in them two lofty attributes: One, the tribes were encamped separately from each other. Two,<b> and the spirit of Hashem rested upon him</b> — that the spirit of Hashem rested upon each tribe separately, and their king was at their head. The reason [the spirit of Hashem rested upon them] is because each tribe had its own status — either due to the merits that one had over the other or due to their population. The connection between these two matters is also hinted at by the Sages, for they said: Through Yisroel being arranged in such a manner, each tribe separate, the spirit of Hashem rested upon them and they became a chariot for it. This is the intention of, <b>and the spirit of Hashem rested upon him</b> [The word and connects this phrase directly to the previous one].

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>How goodly.</b> Among the Jewish People there are two groups — those who study Torah at set times, and those who are constantly occupied with Torah study. Regarding the former, the working class, the verse says, <b>how goodly are your tents, Yaakov</b> — for a tent is not set permanently. Regarding the latter, the group who studies Torah constantly, the verse says, <b>your dwelling places, Yisroel.</b> 
Furthermore, this verse corresponds to two historical periods. One, while the Jewish People were in the wilderness with Hashem's presence with them inside the tent, as the verse says (Shemos 26:7), Make … for a אהל (tent) over the <i>mishkan.</i> Corresponding to that, it says, how goodly are your tents. Two, after the Jewish People settled in their land, as the verse says (Malachim I 8:12), Adonoy said that He would dwell in the dark cloud. Corresponding to that, it says, your dwelling places, Yisroel. It says tents, in the plural, because the tent has various levels — the [outer] אהל מועד, the משכן [beyond that], and [the Holy of Holies] inside the curtain.

<b>Amalek was the first among nations.</b> The meaning of this verse is as follows: <b>The first among nations </b>that Yisroel was commanded to destroy; they were not commanded at first except regarding Amalek. This was soon after the exodus from Egypt, and the fight between them continued — Shaul did what he had done against them, and the Jewish People did what they had done against them in the days of Mordechai. The verse says, <b>and his end will be total destruction.</b> The meaning of this is as follows: Their ultimate end will not come until there will be total destruction. In other words: When the Moshiach comes and destroys all the nations, then the ultimate end of Amalek will come and they will be obliterated.

<b>The name of the slain Israelite man.</b> This poses a difficulty: If Hashem wished to reveal the names of the slain persons He should have mentioned them at the time of the deed. However, Hashem does not wish to degrade even a wicked person by publicizing the one who did despicable deeds. The case of the gatherer of wood proves this. 
In our case as well, Hashem did not reveal their names at the time of the deed. However, after He mentioned the praise of Pinchas, who was zealous for Hashem and made atonement for Bnei Yisroel, it was mentioned also that he took action not on simple persons but on an important man, a tribal leader, and on a woman who was a head of spiritual impurities and the daughter of a king, who died an abominable, degraded death before everyone. In such situations Hashem’s Name is sanctified. This is why her lineage — that she was the daughter of a king — was mentioned. Although there was also degradation to the Jewish man through this, still, the righteous man should not be slighted what is due to him, as it says (Mishlei 10:7): “The mention of a righteous man is for a blessing,” and furthermore, there would be fulfillment of, “the name of the wicked shall rot”.

<b>On the plains of Moav.</b> The reason it mentioned that this count was on the plains of Moav was as stated by the Sages (Midrash Rabbah 21:7): An analogy to a shepherd who turned over his flock to a new shepherd, etc. When they were on the plains of Moav, by the Yardein near Yereicho, the leadership of the loyal shepherd [Moshe] ended and he returned them with an accounting. For this reason as well, Scripture precedes this section with the phrase, “It was after the plague,” to point out that even after the plague they reached the number of the first counting. This is why Scripture mentioned the place in the context of when Moshe spoke, and not in the context of Hashem’s command, as it usually does, for Moshe was the one who needed to show that the flock had not lost its number during his leadership.

<b>You too.</b> This is explained based on the words of the Sages (Yalkut 787): Aharon said to Moshe, “If I had known I would have wanted it beforehand.” Hashem was promising Moshe here that you too will desire to be gathered when you see the sweetness of the moment of that death. Furthermore, Hashem wished to give notice to Moshe of the mitzvah incumbent on a righteous man at the time of death. He should accept upon himself the righteousness of Divine justice and desire that the decree of the King be fulfilled. That is the meaning of, you too — even you as well will agree to be gathered, as it says, “In Your hand I will deposit my soul” (Tehillim 31:6). 
The reason Hashem follows this order is because He wants to take the righteous man’s soul only with his acceptance, due to His great love for His beloved ones. Also, in this way the righteous man attains complete fulfillment, as it says (Devorim 6:5), “With all your soul”.

Verse 1

<b>Very large herds.</b> The Torah informs us that they had very large herds to justify their request for the lands of Sichon and Og. The reason they had more than all the other tribes was because they were powerful men and their soldiers plundered more than all the other tribes.

<b>They approached.</b> Although they were standing in front of Moshe, the reason it says they approached is because they distanced themselves when Moshe reacted angrily, and said: <b>You have now risen in the place of your fathers as a group of sinners.</b>
 Alternatively, it was because Moshe said the problem was based on things they could rectify. Therefore, they took heart and approached him even closer than they were at the time they first requested.

<b>If you will do this, if you will arm yourselves.</b> Moshe’s purpose in making these statements was because he saw that Gad and Reuvein only intended to go with Yisroel so they would receive land across the Yardein. However, such intention was wrong for success in the war, because soldiers have to go in order to take revenge from the enemies of Hashem. An obligatory war is a commandment of Hashem. Rambam writes (Hilchos Melachim 7:15): “The soldier’s intention must be only to sanctify Hashem’s name, and he is assured he will come to no harm...” 
These tribes, however, could be unsuccessful and come to harm if their intention was only for the land. Therefore, Moshe told them: If you will do this, if you will arm yourselves. Corresponding to what they said (v. 17): “We will then arm ourselves rapidly,” Moshe said: If you will do this. Corresponding to their intention to go only in fulfillment of their condition, he said: If you will arm yourselves before Adonoy and go. Moshe was very exact when he said before Adonoy, as the halachah cited by the Rambam, that their intention must be for the sake of a sanctification of Hashem’s name.

<b>For the tribe of Yehudah, Kaleiv son of Yefuneh.</b> I saw written in the name of Rabbeinu Nissim Gaon that it was not needed to mention the word “leader” concerning Yehudah, as it is known that Kaleiv was the leader. Shimon was not fitting to have a leader after the episode of Zimri. For Binyamin: Elidad is in fact Eldad. He had already merited prophesy and it would be a demotion for him to be called a leader. 
It is also possible to say that the leadership of Kaleiv over Yehudah was not attributed out of respect for the kingship that was to come from him, and the same for Binyamin because the kings of Yisroel were to start from him, meaning Shaul Ish Yemini. For Shimon the reason given by the Gaon is correct.

<b>And have them given to the Levites.</b> This means that even though Hashem commanded that the Levites would not have a portion and inheritance in the land, as a kindness they were given a free gift from what was owed to them, just as we give a livelihood to those who cannot manage alone. This is why Scripture was careful to say, cities in which to settle, meaning they needed a place to dwell, and for this reason it was repeated afterwards (v. 3): <b>These cities shall be theirs for dwelling</b>, to show you that the words “in which to settle” mentioned earlier is the reason they were given to them. Our Sages said it is teaching that the cities should be for dwelling, and should not have fields around them.
