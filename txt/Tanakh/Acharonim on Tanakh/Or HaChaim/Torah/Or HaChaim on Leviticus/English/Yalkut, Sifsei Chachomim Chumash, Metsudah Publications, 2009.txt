<b>A fire-offering of pleasing fragrance.</b> Chazal said: It says regarding an animal, a fire-offering of pleasing fragrance, and it says regarding a bird, a fire-offering of pleasing fragrance, to inform us that it is the same whether one brings a little or a lot, as long as his intention is for the sake of Heaven. Chazal are answering the question: Let the Torah state a fire-offering of pleasing fragrance only regarding a bird, which costs a small amount, and we would derive an animal, which is expensive, through a <i>kal va</i><i>chomer</i>! This is why they were exact in their expression when they said: To <i>inform</i> us that it is the same whether one brings a little or a lot, i.e., Scripture comes to inform us that there is no difference between one who brings a little or a lot, and you should not think that this is only because God in His Mercy accepts the poor mans sacrifice.

<b>If his means are not sufficient.</b> Although he has the means for more than two pigeons or turtledoves, as long that he does not have the means for a sheep, even if he lacks only an <i>issar</i> (small coin), he brings the offering of a poor man. Chazal derived (Toras Kohanim) from the word ידו that he need not borrow, because a mitzvah performed immediately is cherished.

<b>Moshe said … This is the edict.</b> He informed them that this was commanded by Hashem so that they would not object as did Korach and his congregation, who claimed Moshe made it up by himself. This shows that Korach rebelled with prior intent, for Moshe informed them at the time that Aharon was appointed by Hashem. <b>And bathed them in water.</b> Chazal said that Aharon and his sons merited the sanctification of the hands and feet through the laver and the immersions of Yom Kippur by means of this bathing on the eighth day. Therefore, when it says (v. 5), “This is the edict that Adonoy commanded to do,” it refers to performing the sanctification of the hands and feet and the immersions of Yom Kippur in future generations.

Chapter 9



Verse 1




<b>And it was.</b> The Torah uses the expression of pain, ויהי (and it was), because Nadav and Avihu, who had no equal among the Jewish people, died on that day. 
Another reason could be because of Moshe’s pain, when he saw his greatness and the greatness of his descendents in the hands of Aharon and his sons. Moshe was punished for entreating Hashem that he should not go as His messenger to Pharaoh; at that time He took away the role of priesthood from Moshe and gave it to Aharon forever. Although Moshe was very righteous and humble, he had emotions like any other human being, especially with regard to such a lofty mitzvah. However, it could be this pain is hinted to in the verse (Bamidbar 7:1) “And it was (ויהי) that on the day that Moses finished erecting the Mishkan,” and it is the death of Nadav and Avihu that is hinted to in our verse. 
<b>Moshe called to Aharon.</b> Normally, when a person has to give up an anticipated position of greatness to someone else, even if it is his brother, he will be unable to do so with the following three levels of perfection: 1) To do it with alacrity, 2) to pass over all the associated levels of greatness as well, and 3) to do it in public. Here, the Torah informs us that Moshe had the personal greatness to do all three. It says, “on the eighth day,” to indicate that Moshe, with his pure heart, rose with alacrity to do it early in the morning. Secondly, he combined all the associate levels of greatness when he called “to Aharon <i>and to his sons</i>,” for someone who is upset about giving up the position would minimize the pain by giving up only one level at first, and then later the associate level. Moshe, however, although he did not have to call both Aharon and his sons, was willing to bear the greater pain to see his greatness passed over to both Aharon and his sons. Thirdly, they stood before the elders in a public display. All this shows Moshe’s perfect desire to fulfill the will of Hashem.

<b>Aharon approached the altar.</b> The matter of offerings can be explained based on the principle that Hashem avowed to establish the world and its inhabitants with judgment — “anyone who says that Hashem overlooks [judgment], his innards will be forsaken.” Therefore, since the judgment of a person who sins is to be put to death, as the prophet says, how can he bring an offering and be forgiven? It seems the correct and just approach to this is to realize that when a person sins he is not considered in the aspect of a human being, as Chazal said: “A person only sins because a spirit of insanity enters him” and he becomes animal-like. When he repents, however, his spirit is human, and he rises in level from an animal to a human being. Should this human being be killed in place of an animal? Therefore he brings something resembling the entity that sinned, which is an animal, and he connects to its pain in his thoughts: This was what should have been done to me. Accordingly, it is the part of man that feels emotion that saves him with these thoughts. This is described in the verse (Tehillim 36:7), “You save both man and animal, O God.” The animal portion of man joins with the human part, which is the intellect, and is saved by it, i.e., together with the human aspect, so that it will not be punished when it is not liable for punishment. Therefore, when a sinner brings an offering it is in the letter of the law even in considerations of pure justice, as it says (Ibid.): “Your judgments are [like] the vast deep. You save both man and animal, O God”.

<b>These are unclean to you.</b> Why does Scripture not include the serpent, which is the source of the impurity of all the creeping creatures and their kind? Perhaps the reason is that the serpent’s impurity is in its life-force and not its body, and after its death the body remains completely empty, like dust of the earth. The impurity does not cling to its body since it is nothing at all. This is similar to what Chazal said: A non-Jew does not cause impurity in a tent but a Yisrael causes impurity in a tent. This is for the same reason. The creeping creatures’ impurity is in their body more than their life-force, and that is why they cause impurity in their death and not in their life; this teaches that the serpent’s impurity is greater than that of the creeping creatures.

<b>Whoever eats of its carcass.</b> The verse should not be interpreted, simply that the carcass causes impurity in the gullet [when it is swallowed without touching], for we find the Torah said regarding the carcass of a permitted fowl: “One shall not eat to become unclean through it.” We derive from this that one becomes unclean in the gullet by means of the permitted fowl’s carcass, but not that of an animal.

<b>On the eighth day.</b> Chazal said that the infantis circumcised on the eighth day because Hashem’s mercy is upon the infant that he should have strength. Just as His mercy is upon a human being, so too His mercy is upon animals, as it says (Vayikro 22:27): “From the eighth day and thereafter it may be favorably accepted.”  
This has to be understood: How did Chazal know that from eight days and onwards the infant would have strength, no more and no less? It would seem that the strength they are referring to is what is mentioned in the Zohar: The child is circumcised at eight days so that he will be ensured that a Shabbos has passed over him. Therefore, the soul of life energy, which brings abundance into the world on Shabbos day, will reach the baby. Thus, he will be a viable child, and this is what Chazal meant by a “strength of life energy”.

<b>He is clean, and the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him clean.</b> Chazal said in Toras Kohanim: “It says, ‘he is clean,’ I might think he may exempt himself and go, therefore it says, ‘the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him clean.’ I might think that if a <i>kohein</i> declares an unclean person to be clean that he will be clean, therefore it says: ‘he is clean, and the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him clean.’ It was for this matter that Hillel went up from Bavel to Eretz Yisrael” (Sifra, Parshah 5 Perek 9:15). This piece implies that Hillel could not conclusively prove the halachah from the verse until he went up to Eretz Yisrael and received the tradition that the halachah was indeed as he interpreted the verse. However, it needs to be understood: How did the scholars who disagreed with Hillel interpret the verse?
It seems we can say that “he is clean, and the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him clean” is [entirely] needed to teach the halachah that he must not exempt himself and go, instead, the <i>kohein</i> must declare him clean. If it did not say “he is clean” I would think that only when the person does not know what his condition is then the <i>kohein</i> must come and inform him, because the <i>kohein</i> is the expert in these laws and the Torah asks that it should be from his mouth. However, if the person knows that it is a merely a scurf (v. 39) he may exempt himself and go. Therefore the Torah says, “he is clean, [and the <i>kohein</i>] shall declare him clean.” Thus, there is no compulsion to interpret the verse like Hillel, until he went up to Eretz Yisrael and found that the halachah was so … And this is a correct principle in explaining the Torah.  
It appears to me that we can resolve some [apparently contradictory] statements of Chazal: They stated that there is no matter that was not transmitted to Moshe on Mount Sinai, even that which a veteran student would innovate in the future. On the other hand, they interpreted a verse to the effect that matters that were revealed to Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues were not revealed to Moshe. Similarly, there are other statements of this sort.  
It seems that the resolution of these statements is that in truth every matter of Torah was said to Moshe and no wise man can know more than Moshe knew. Even if we combine all the generations of the people of Israel from the day of the Giving of the Torah until the “entire earth is filled with knowledge” there is no innovation that was not known by Moshe. But in this there is a difference: Hashem gave to Moshe the Written Torah and the Oral Torah, and in His wisdom Hashem recorded the entire Oral Torah in the Written Torah. However, He did not inform Moshe where each part of the Oral Torah is hinted at in the Written Torah. This is the labor of the Jews who toil in the Torah; they must resolve the laws that were said to Moshe at Sinai, and find a place in the Written Torah for all the secrets and the derivations of the laws. This is why we find that the Tannaim composed works such as the Toras Kohanim and Sifrei, etc. Their interpretations in Scripture were only according to the halachos, and those after them ‘clothed’ them in Hashem’s perfect Written Torah. Until today this is the Torah scholars’ Divine service — to be exact in the verses and settle them according to the statements of the Oral Torah. This is the labor in the Torah called the Land of Life, and it was entirely transmitted to Moshe to know … This example is a proof of this — for Hillel derived from Scripture the law that was transmitted orally to Moshe. Hashem did not reveal its source in Scripture to Moshe, until Hillel came and derived.

Chapter 14



Verse 1



Verse 2



<b>This shall be the law of the <i>metzoro</i>.</b> Based on extra words in the verse, the Sages interpreted that <i>metzoro</i> should be understood as a slanderer, <i>motzi sheim ra</i>, and they interpreted the verse as follows, “this will be the law of the slanderer …” What needs to be understood is why this matter was hinted at here where the procedure for purification is discussed. It appears that the answer is that since Scripture is about to discuss bringing of the birds, it introduces here that the reason for his punishment is that his sin was speaking maliciously. Therefore, his rectification is that he shall bring birds that chatter the way he did.  
Furthermore, it can be explained in this way: <i>Tzora’as</i> is naturally caused by bodily infection and fungus, and by the increase in bile that leaves an impression upon his skin. These factors are brought about by sadness, pain, and mental depression. The natural remedy would be to remove the depression and to do things that open up one’s heart and cause happiness. Now, when a skin-eruption occurs to someone, he can say that it is a natural disease that could happen to anyone. When they tell him that it is due to speaking maliciously he will refuse to believe it and he will not accept the righteousness of his punishment. Therefore, Hashem in His wisdom decreed that the <i>metzoro</i> must be confined and dwell alone outside of the camp, and that his garments are torn, etc. These things are in natural opposition to curing the cause of <i>tzora’as</i>. On the contrary, they would lead to a new skin-eruption. Thus, a person sees that although he does things that are incompatible with a cure, nevertheless, the plague goes away. This was only because he had thoughts of repentance and confessed his sin, and realized that due to the sin of his tongue he received this plague that revealed his character flaw, and he repented his sin and purified his speech. With this he will know and it will be conclusively proven that the plague came to him only because he spoke <i>lashon hara</i>. And this is the meaning of what the Sages said, “this will be the law of the slanderer …”.

Verse 21

<b>If he is poor.</b> Why does it continue with the superfluous statement, “and his means are not sufficient”? … 
This hints that only in the case where his means are <i>still</i> not sufficient [does he bring the offering of the poor man], but if he were to become rich in the interim he brings a rich man’s offering … 

Also, it seems that he will only be obligated [to bring a rich man’s offering] if he has enough [after bringing the offering] that he will not be lacking what he needs for his own livelihood. This is because even if he became poor the law is that he brings a poor man’s offering and retains enough for his sustenance from the rest of his possessions …
Chazal made additional derivations in Toras Kohanim from three extra verses in the section about the <i>metzoro</i>’s financial means: 1) “Such as his means suffice” (14:22), 2) “From that which his means suffice” (14:30), and 3) “That for which his means are sufficient” (14:31). Chazal derived from these as follows: 1) “Such as his means suffice” — for someone who was rich beforehand but at the time of bringing the offering he became poor, to teach us that he also brings the offering of a poor man. 2) “From that which his means suffice” comes for someone who was rich and began to bring his guilt-offering when he was still rich but became poor, to teach that he should also bring a poor man’s offering. 3) “That for which his means are sufficient” comes for someone who began to bring the first offering, the guilt-offering, when he was poor and then he became rich, to teach that he should bring the rest of the offerings as a rich man. However, if he brought the sinoffering as a poor man he should not bring the burnt-offering as a rich man even if he became rich in the interim. The Sages derived this from, “one for a sin-offering and one for a burntoffering” (Vayikro 5:7) — which teaches that they should be of the same kind.

<b>In the walls of the house.</b> This section hints to the way Hashem deals with the wicked that have chosen the evil inclination’s rationalizations, which are called the eruptions (<i>negaim</i> = biases) of human beings. It states in the Zohar that Hashem placed the soul into man’s body and if it succeeds that is fine, but if not he uproots it from there and replants it in another place. This is hinted at in the eruption of a house. The house represents man’s body, which houses the soul, and the <i>kohein</i> hints at the Creator. We find in the Zohar that the Sages derived from the verse, “the <i>kohein</i> will come” — when Hashem sees that there is an eruption in the walls of the house, which means the aspect of evil has become settled in the innermost parts of the body’s essence and the house has become an abomination…

Chapter 15



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Speak to Bnei Yisroel.</b> This can be explained according to Chazal’s words: Bnei Yisroel cause impurity through a flow of discharge but the nations of the world do not cause impurity through a discharge. That is why it says “speak” — which connotes a harsh form of speech — for impurity will be present among them more than among the non-Jews. A Jew who has a discharge flow imparts impurity to a chair by sitting on it or a bed by lying down, but a non-Jew with a discharge flow does not impart the impurity of sitting or lying down. <b>And say to them.</b> This connotes a higher level, as in (Devarim 26:17), “You have selected (האמרת) Hashem,” or (ibid. 18), “Hashem has selected you (האמירך).” The Torah intends to explain that although impurity is more attached to the Jews, this is because they are on a higher level, for they are pure but the nations of the world are not pure. This is like the concept (Shabbos 13b): “An insane person does not know what suffering he endures, and dead flesh does not feel the knife”.

<b>Who will ensnare.</b> It appears to me that when it says, “who will ensnare” it means to prohibit intentionally trapping an unclean species, even though the Torah permits one to have benefit from it … like the Rambam’s view that the Torah only permits them if someone was hunting for a permitted species and these unclean species were caught with them. This is the intent of the verse here, “that he will ensnare.” It is a condition — one is only permitted to hunt “that is permitted to be eaten” and not what is prohibited to be eaten. That is why it continues to say, “<i>and</i> cover it”; from the extra <i>vav</i> of וכסהו we derive that there is another commandment that precedes this commandment, and that previous commandment is not to hunt an animal that may not be eaten.

Verse 14






<b>Cover it with earth.</b> Why did Hashem command to cover the blood of a wild animal and fowl and not the blood of a domesticated animal? We can understand that there is more glory and splendor to sprinkle the blood of the domesticated animal on the altar than that of wild animals or fowl. However, why is a domesticated animal worse off than a wild animal when it comes to slaughtering an un-consecrated animal, in which the blood falls to the ground and is revealed? Furthermore, what is the reason that Hashem chose sacrifices from domesticated animals and not from wild animals or fowl, except for pigeons and doves? 
We have explained that the blood of the wild animal is the life force (<i>nefesh</i>) itself, which is not the case with a domesticated animal, which has a <i>nefesh</i> besides the blood. One of the components of the domesticated animal’s <i>nefesh</i> is the blood, but the blood itself is not the <i>nefesh</i>. Hashem did not command to cover blood in this circumstance, but rather only blood that is the <i>nefesh</i> itself [because it is proper to show it respect, just as Hashem commanded burial for human beings to show them respect; see the previous paragraph in the <i>Or HaChayim</i>]. This is not the case with domesticated animals, for the blood itself is not the <i>nefesh</i>, as it is the case with wild animals and fowl. Although the domesticated animal’s blood contains <i>nefesh</i>, nevertheless, the blood itself is not the <i>nefesh</i>. Covering the blood is only for what is sensed and not for the <i>hiyuli </i>(the aspect of existence that precedes form), even though it is there.

<b>Gashes for the dead.</b> It says “for the dead” to indicate that [it is prohibited] even though the gash was made as a bodily wound for the loss of a beloved one. It states in an exacting way, “do not make in your skin” to inform us that one [who made a gash for the dead] would not make this blemish in his soul, but rather only in the skin which is the soul’s sheath. The reason for this is because a person is overwhelmed by the death of his loved one and the deed is not as spiritually harmful as one who does it maliciously and with a settled mind. This is why the verse says afterwards, “Do not put tattoo marks on yourselves,” and did not mention, “in your skin.” This teaches that the tattoo causes harm not only in the skin but also in a person’s innermost parts, since he is not doing it as a result of grief and emotional pain. About times of emotional stress the Sages said, “A person is not held accountable when in pain”.

<b>And I shall give it to you.</b> This verse raises a difficulty: Since it said that they will inherit it, why does it need to say “I shall give it to you”?

Verse 3

<b>If you follow My statutes.</b> It says in Toras Kohanim: “That you should labor in [studying] Torah.” The reason that Scripture calls labor in Torah a חוק (statute) is because there is a mitzvah to always study Torah, even matters we have studied many times and know well. This is because Hashem desires that we study Torah, and He made it a statute [that we must study]. The Sages said that in His Wisdom Hashem decreed that a person will forget what he learns so he will always have the desire to study Torah.



































The verse can also be explained as speaking about the commandments’ general principles. A person might think that the commandments’ main purpose and their benefit is only for someone who knows their reasons, but performing a mitzvah without knowing the reason is a worthless deed, like a body without a soul. In fact, this concept was written in the name of the Arizal: “A deed without intention is like an empty vessel, for the main thing is the thought.” The word of Hashem here addresses this idea: “If you follow My statutes.” This means that the performance of commandments with the intention that they are statutes enacted by Hashem, Blessed be He, will help as if he fulfilled the commandments as Hashem intended they be done.

Verse 4



Verse 5








<b>And you will live securely.</b> This blessing is an answer to the problem that all the aforementioned blessings could be fulfilled but they would still be of no benefit. This would be true in the case where they are troubled by wars; in one year they would be able to plow and harvest but in the year they could not. Therefore the Torah says, “And you will live securely in your land” — there will be no disturbance. Each year you will have the aforementioned blessing. <b>In your land.</b> The entire world will recognize and know that it is your land and that no strangers have any right to it; you will not have even the slightest concern about this and you will dwell securely.

Verse 6

<b>I will grant peace in the land.</b> Why was this said after it already said, “And you will live securely”? Perhaps it means that the people of Israel themselves will not have discord, for Hashem will imbue them with peace and friendship. Alternatively, it is possible that it refers to the world in general. The proof of this is that when it speaks about Eretz Yisrael in particular it uses a specific designation, as it says in the previous verse, “in <i>your</i> land.” Here, however, it says, “in <i>the</i> land,” because it is promising them that the entire world will have peace. Hashem desires world peace, as we find regarding the seventy oxen of the Sukkos festival which correspond to the seventy nations of the world; there are statements of the Sages to this effect. In natural terms as well, at the time of world wars even those who dwell securely will be frightened by the “voice of battle.” This is why it concludes: “You will lie down without fear”.

<b>You will eat the old long kept.</b> The produce will not decay, become rotten, or be lost through the consumption of <i>politikin</i> [wealthy people who act like kings and are overindulgent in what they eat — Rambam, Terumot 2:5]. On the contrary, you will choose to eat the oldest produce. This is why it repeats the language and says, “old long kept”  
and it says, “And the old you will have to clear out because of the new.” This means you will not have to clear it out because it is old and spoiled, but only to make room for the new. The Torah emphasizes the great extent of the goodness, because although Hashem will cause them to be fruitful and multiply, nevertheless, they will still have an abundance of goodness.

<b>And My soul will loathe.</b> Why does this need to be said? It is obvious that He will loath them, for when they are completely righteous they are blessed, “And My spirit will not loathe you.” It is understood that this blessing does not apply at the time they are wicked. Certainly, it only states the punishments that exist besides the lack of blessings. 
The answer is it intends to say “My soul will loathe” even the righteous people of the time, as in the verse (Hoshea 4:5): “And the prophet that is with you shall also stumble.” It also means that prophets will no longer prophesize in Israel, for Hashem’s Divine Presence, which has the aspect of a “soul” among them, will no longer appear. There is no curse worse than this, and that is why it is placed after a number of curses, which teaches that it is worse than all the preceding. It has been fulfilled in this day and age, and over this our eyes have been consumed and our soul grieves very much. Woe to us!

Verse 31



Verse 32

<b>I will make the land desolate.</b> It says “I,” which means that this measure will be done by Hashem Himself, and the reason is because it is a kindly measure, as the Sages stated: “For their enemies will not find any satisfaction in their land”.

Verse 36

<b>Those of you who survive.</b> Meaning, those that remain after all this in their wickedness and have not repented, as it said above (v. 21), “If you walk contrary to Me, etc.” Similarly, it says, “Those of you who remain,” which means, they remain in their original temperament — I will continue “to send timidity into their hearts … and they will fall with no one chasing them …” From the origin of the matter you see that although ruin after ruin shall come to them, the nation will not be destroyed, as it says in the end (v. 44): “I will not despise them … to annihilate them”.
