Haamek Davar on Genesis

Kidmat Ha'Emek



The Torah has the nature and qualities of poetry, which is speech in flowery language. Everyone familiar with learning knows that flowery language differs from prose narrative in two  features of its nature and qualities. A.) In poetry, the idea is not laid out clearly the way it is in a prose narrative, and it requires marginal notes explaining to what narrative each stanza refers. This is not “derush”; this is just the nature of poetry… B.) Poetry is uniquely capable of alluding to things outside the conceptual scope of the poem, such as when the first letters of each stanza follow the order of the alphabet or the name of the author. This capability belongs to poetry, but not to prose narrative, as it famously requires distorting the language in order to achieve… and this feature can be found in the entirety of the Torah.

Introduction to Genesis

This Book commonly known as The Book of <i>Bereishis</i>, is referred to by the Prophets as <i>Sefer HaYashar</i>, the Book of the Upright, as stated in Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 25a pertaining to the two [following] verses:<br>1. “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is this not written in the <i>Sefer HaYashar</i>?”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 10:13.This verse refers to the miracle, where Yehoshua ordered the sun and the moon to stand still so that the Israelites could destroy their enemies in battle before nightfall. See <i>Avodah Zarah</i> ad loc.: “Where [in Genesis is the miracle of the staying of the sun and moon] alluded to? [In the verse where Yaakov blesses Ephraim, Yehoshua’s ancestor:] <i>The awe of his offspring will fill the nations</i> (Gen. 48:19)</i><br>2. “And he said to teach the Sons of Yehuda the bow. Behold it is written in the <i>Sefer HaYashar</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">II Sam. 1:18. In his eulogy for King Saul and his fallen sons, David states that it is written in the <i>Sefer HaYashar</i> that the children of Yehuda are the ones most suited for archery. Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> ad loc continues: Where [in Genesis is Yehuda mastery of archery] alluded to? [In the verse where Yaakov blesses Judah:] <i>Judah – you, your brothers shall acknowledge, your hand will be at the nape of your enemies</i> (Gen. 49:8). Which form of warfare requires the hand to be raised opposite the nape? You must say that it is the method used with the archer’s bow.”</i><br>R’ Yochanan [ad loc.] explains that [<i>Sefer HaYashar</i>] is the book, [<i>Bereishis,</i> depicting the lives] of Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, who were called “upright” [by Bilaam ]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This was recited by Bilaam the Wicked, who was hired by Balak, King of Moab to curse the Nation of Israel. The meaning of this phrase will be explained below.</i>, as stated, “Let me die the death of the upright.” <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 23:10. ….</i>
This requires examination. Why did Bilaam characterize our forefathers specifically with the name <i>yashar</i> (upright), as opposed to <i>tzadikim</i>, <i>chasidim</i>, or any other designation [depicting righteousness]? Further, why is this specific Book characterized by the title of <i>Yashar</i> and why would Bilaam pray for himself that his end should be as those who possess this characteristic?
[The meaning of] <i>yashar </i>is as described in the Song of <i>Ha’azenu</i>:<br>The Rock - perfect is His work, for all His paths are justice; a faithful God without injustice - righteous and <i>yashar</i> is He.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 32:4; see <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> ad loc.</i><br>By praising [God as] <i>yashar,</i> [the Torah] acknowledges the Holy One blessed be He’s judgment to be weighed against a generation [such as those who would] live during the destruction of the Second Temple, who are described as a <i>perverse and twisted generation</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 32:5.</i> We explained [ad loc], though they were righteous and pious, toiling in Torah study, they were not upright in their societal behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Netziv ad loc writes: “He [i.e., that generation] walks perversely, wandering from the rational path. [Similar to a twisted rope consisting of strands of various grade], so are their actions <i>twisted</i>, interweaving evil acts with the good, such it is difficult to differentiate the good from evil, when evil acts are committed for the sake of Heaven.”</i> And so due to the baseless hatred for one another residing within their hearts, they suspected anyone who was not religious in accordance with their viewpoint to be a Sadducee<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Sadducees rejected the Oral Law and viewed the written Torah as the sole source of divine authority.</i> or heretic. [This deficiency in the Torah scholars’ character] led to rampant murder<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Netziv in <i>Meromei Sadeh</i>, <i>Yoma</i> 9b notes how based on the writings of Josephus, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8b and <i>Gittin</i> 57a we see how murder and violence was rampant during the Second Temple.</i> along with a transgression of all the other evils in the world, causing the Temple’s destruction. [This is how the Torah presents] the acknowledgment of God’s justice [here]: the Holy One blessed be He is <i>yashar,</i> being intolerant of those types of [distorted] righteous individuals. [He is only accepting] of those who act in a way that is socially <i>yashar</i> – unlike those who act in a perverse manner, even when their actions are performed for the sake of Heaven. As such [a deficiency] can lead to the destruction of [God’s] creation and the ruin of civilization.
This was the greatness of our forefathers. In addition to being righteous, pious, and lovers of God to the utmost degree, they were also <i>yesharim</i>. That means they were civil with the [other] nations of the world, despite [the latter] being detestable idol worshipers. Our forefathers nevertheless extended them love and concern for their welfare, as this fortifies [God’s] creation.<br>[To illustrate,] we see how our forefather Avraham exerted himself greatly in prayer for the welfare of Sodom. He desired their survival, even though he totally detested them and their king due to their evil ways (as is clear from how he spoke to the King of Sodom).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When Avraham returned from his victory over Chedorlaomer and his allied kings, the King of Sodom greeted Avraham with the request for them to split the spoils. Avraham then replied (Gen. 14:23): <i>Neither from a thread to a shoe strap, nor will I take from whatever is yours, that you should not say, “I have made Avram wealthy</i>.” Avraham refused to profit from any of the spoils as he did not want to be associated with the king of Sodom in any manner (See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> ad loc.).</i> In the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on <i>Parashas Vayerah</i>, (<i>Parasha</i> 49) we find the following about this:<br>The Holy One Blessed Be He said to our forefather Avraham, “You love righteousness and loathe wickedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 45:8,</i> You love to vindicate My creations and you loathe to convict them.”<br>He literally was like the <i>father of a multitude of nations</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 17:4, 5: <i>You shall be a father of a multitude of nations. Your name shall no longer be Avram, but Avraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations</i>.</i> For even when one’s son is not walking in righteousness, [the father still] seeks out his wellbeing and benefit. Similarly did graciousness and the most remarkable civility abound within Avraham’s words to Lot, as will become clear in the p<i>arashah</i> of <i>Lech L’cha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13As Avraham and Lot accumulated much wealth and many herdsmen they could no longer avoid contact with one another. Since Lot and his employees were of a significantly lower moral nature they instigated strife with Avraham and his herdsmen. Even so it was Avraham who extended the “olive branch” and offered Lot the first choice of where to settle: “<i>Is not all the land before you? Please part from me; if [you go] left, I will go right, and if [you go] right, I will go left</i>” (Gen. 13:9). See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> to Gen. 13:1-9.</i><br>We also see how conciliatory our forefather Yitzchak was with his enemies, and was reconciled to a much greater extent than befitted the minimal words of appeasement submitted by Avimelech and his friends – as explained over there.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 26: 13-31. When Yitzchak became exceedingly prosperous, Avimelech and the Philistines became hostile towards Yitzchak and evicted him from their land. At a later period when Yitzchak dwelled in Gerar, Avimelech together with his general, Pikhol, and his companions, returned to Yitzchak expressing their intent to make a treaty that Yitzchok refrain from harming them. Yitzchak expanded the scope of the treaty to encompass love and peace as stated, <i>Isaac escorted them, and they went away from him in peace </i>(ad loc. v. 31). For an explanation of what harm Avimelech feared could result from Yitzchak, see <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> ad loc.</i><br>Further, even though our forefather Yaakov was justifiably furious with Lavan – as he was aware that Lavan wanted to eradicate [him and his followers; and it would have happened] were it not for God [stopping him]<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">When Lavan stated (Gen. 31:29): <i>I have the power to inflict harm upon you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, “Beware of speaking with Yaakov either good or bad.</i>“ Yaakov understood how Lavan was concealing his real intent, which was to murder him and his followers, and to bring back his family in order to erase their religious beliefs.</i> – he, nevertheless, spoke with [Lavan] in a gentle manner,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Yaakov refrained from openly accusing Lavan of wanting to kill him and his followers.</i> This is the case to such an extent that [the Sages] said of him in <i>Bereishis Rabbah</i> (<i>Parasha</i> 74), “ <i>[Better] the anger of the forefathers than the modesty of the descendant”</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">To quote the Midrash in full: [Better] the anger of the forefathers than the modesty of the descendants. The anger of the Fathers: (Gen. 32:36) <i>And Yaakov was annoyed, and he quarreled with Lavan, and he said to Lavan, "What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have pursued me?”</i> You might think that they would come to blows and violence, but instead there were words of reconciliation. Yaakov appeasing his father-in-law: (Ibid: v. 36) <i>For you have felt about all my things. What have you found of all the utensils of your house</i>? R. Simai said: “When a son-in-law lives with his father-in-law, [urged Yaakov], can he possibly avoid benefitting himself to the extent of a single vessel or a knife? Here, however <i>you have felt about all my things</i> and have you not even found even a needle or a hook?” Than the modesty of the sons: We know this from David: (I Sam. 20:1) <i>And David fled from Naboth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan</i>: “<i>What have I done? What is my sin? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life</i>?” Thus in his very words of appeasement he refers to bloodshed. Here, however, [Yaakov merely says], <i>that you have pursued me</i>.</i> ─ [Yaakov] was readily appeased by him.<br>We have likewise gleaned much [more] from the forefathers’ societal behavior. This behavior is that which sustains the world, which is in turn a theme particular to this Book, the Book of Creation. For this reason this book is also entitled <i>Sefer</i> H<i>a-Yashar</i>, highlighting this aspect of our forefathers’ actions.
Bilaam, while being overcome with the Divine Spirit, could not be astonished by his own evil acts; as he was the prophet of the nations of the world with thoughts immersed in the roots of impurity. It was [self-evident that] he was not as righteous and pious as Avraham, Yitzchak or Yaakov. Rather, he was taken aback by his own societal behavior: Even if it would be natural for him to abhor Israel with an extreme hatred – as they are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov with their thoughts immersed in the roots of holiness – yet, it was unacceptable to attempt to uproot an entire nation, contrary to being <i>yashar</i> and maintaining the existence of the world. For this reason he cried, <i>Let me die the death of the yesharim</i>, meaning those who uphold creation.<br>This explanation [of <i>yashar</i>] can be used to clarify what is stated in Tractate Sanhedrin 105a:<br><i>Let me die the death of the upright</i>: If I die the death of the upright, my end will be like his; but if not, then <i>behold I go unto my people</i>.<br>Rashi explains [<i>death of the righteous</i>] refers to natural death, [being interpreted as: “Let me die the death of the upright — meaning, If I die the death of the righteous (i.e., a natural death), my end will be like his [i.e. to receive life in the world to come]; but if not (i.e., if I die a violent death), then <i>behold I go unto my people [to descend with them together to Gehinom</i>.]<br>It is unclear how the words, <i>death of the yesharim</i>, allude to a natural death [and receiving eternal life in the world to come] and [certainly] the ending words, <i>but if not, then behold I go unto my people</i>, do not seem to allude [to <i>Gehinom</i>] at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18The Netziv in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> (Num. 23:10) argues that Bilaam would not entertain the thought of receiving a life in the world to come equal to that of the Israelites who were immersed in the study of Torah and the practice of <i>mitzvos</i>. Further the Netziv seems to object that descending to <i>Gehinom</i> does not align well with “my people,” i.e. an expression denoting a national impact.</i> Rather, using what I wrote above [it is to be explained as follows]: <i>Let me die the death of the yesharim</i>, meaning, if I do not desire the extermination of man [as Avraham, Ytzchak and Yaakov],<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Netziv aligns tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> with tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> that <i>yesharim</i> is referring to Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov. This is unlike Rashi who explains <i>yesharim</i> to be referring to righteous individuals.</i> “then my end should be the same [as the Jewish nation, where I will live on in perpetuity].”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bilaam at the moment of being overcome with the Divine Spirit stated that if he wishes for the survival of the Jewish nation, then “measure for measure” his end should be as theirs, to live on in history (or through his progeny) among those who contributed to the good of the world..</i> But if not, i.e., I wish for the extermination of Israel [and hence not be <i>yashar</i>] – [which he actually attempted to achieve] as stated: <i>Come I shall advise you [how to cause their downfall] etc</i>.,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 24:14. See Rashi ad loc. explaining Sanhedrin 106a that this verse relates how Bilaam advised Balak how to destroy the Jews by seducing them to sin with immorality.</i>] – <i>then alas I will go unto my people</i>; [I will be] exterminated, as [will indeed befall] all “<i>of my people</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">However, if he wishes for their extermination, Bilaam laments, so will his end be as his people, i.e. an eventual extermination from the world and the disappearance from history.</i>
We have explained well why this book is entitled, <i>Sefer HaYashar,</i> being the Book of Creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Creation is sustained by the phenomenal societal behavior exhibited by the upright.</i>





Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>In the beginning <i>Elohim</i> [God] created:</b> <i>Elohim</i> means judge. Indeed, just like the statutes of the Torah are called judgement [or laws]. Similarly, the properties of nature that the Holy One, blessed be He, ingrained in His world are called judgement [or laws]. As is explained in [Tractate] Shabbat 155,  "'The righteous One knows the judgement of the poor ones' (Proverbs 29:7); the Holy One, blessed be He, knows that that the dog's food [supply] is sparse, etc.;" and the matter is not in the category of punishment, but rather this is [its] nature, and that is called judgement. And behold [regarding] the name, God/Judge, even though its simple understanding is the One who runs His world in judgement, nonetheless, here, its understanding is the One who creates His world with judgement. And this is its understanding in the Sifri, at the beginning of Parshat Ve'etchanan concerning the prayer of Moshe, "Lord, God/Judge, in judgement have you created the world." And there, we explained with His help, may He be blessed, why the Sages, of blessed memory, explained the intention of Moshe in this way. And also see, what I have written further, Genesis 9:16, and in the Book of Exodus 6:2. 
<b>The heavens and the earth:</b> The clear simple explanation is that which was written by Ramban on verse 8, that [the Torah] is not speaking in this verse about the firmament that would on the second day be called, heavens; and about the dry land that would be called land on the third day. It [follows] from this that the firmament is not intrinsically and inevitably heavens, and so [too] dry land is not inevitably earth; rather [it is only that] the Holy One, blessed be He, called the firmament, heavens, and the dry land, earth; which is not the case in this verse - [instead, here] it is implied that, in essence and to begin with, their qualities are evident; which is that their names are heavens and earth, [even] without being given [these names.] Just like the name, dry land, is not [dependent on its] being given a name, but rather it is self-evident that dry dirt and soil is called dry land, based on its characteristics [and so will be explained about man, later.] And the explanation is that in the beginning of the creation, [it was] His will, may He be blessed, that all the workings of the world should be [by way of] emanator and recipient. An example is the sun and the seven planets that emanate to us. Nonetheless, they receive from what is higher than them. And about what is higher than them, we say in the prayer text, "who takes out the sun from its place and the moon from its  dwelling place." And it is known that the movement of the sun and the moon is not in this fashion, but the intent  is [regarding] the causes of motion of the sun and the moon. And they are called according to their action, as per the explanation of Rambam, of blessed memory, on the Tractate Avodah Zarah - the form of the sun is the 'constellation' of the sun. And behold, all of the emanators [together] are referred to by the name, heavens [<i>shamayim</i>,] because of the letters [that form the combinations], <i>shem, yim</i>: the meaning of <i>shem</i> [name] is the latent potential to emanate; and <i>yim</i> is an even number [to indicate] the plural [form] as with <i>yadayim</i> [hands] and <i>raglayim</i> [feet]; and <i>eretz</i> [earth] indicates the recipient, the nature of which is to run [<i>ratz</i>] to receive the emanation. [And see what I have written in the book of Deuteronomy in Parshat Ha'azinu Hashamayim and in Parshat Berakha on the verse (Deuteronomy 33:28), "even His heavens drop down dew."] And the verse did not explain anything about the highest emanators, since they cannot be fathomed, except by those of great intelligence. And whoever's mind is sharp will find a hint about it all, as it is with everything. And the earth begins from the higher waters, in the midst of which, afterwards God made the firmament. And the potential of the water above the firmament, and its form, was made different than the lower waters, as will be explained.  

Verse 2

<b>Chaos:</b> This name rests on something that is not distinguished and differentiated from anything else. [Just] like a wilderness - where there is no recognition of different places - is called in the song of [Parshat] Ha'azinu, “and in the void.” And in [Tractate] Avodah Zarah 8, there is [found that the first] “two thousand years were chaos.” And the explanation [of this is that it was [a time of the] action of youth, without Torah – all of the actions of man were the same, without difference. And this is the intention of Targum Onkelos, [when he translates the word as] “empty;” that in an empty place, one part is no different than an other.
<b>And void:</b> This name [<i>bohu</i>, which when broken down is made up of 'in it' and 'it'] rests [on this concept] because much was included 'in it;' meaning from the dry land below the waters, to the end of the waters, the nature of all creation was included in it, [as well as] the potential of the creatures [that would be created] afterward.
<b>And darkness was upon the depths: </b>This is the element of fire that was within the ground, as even today there are many elements of fire [in the ground;] and if [the ground] releases them, the earth quakes.
<b>And the spirit/wind of God was hovering upon the face of the waters:</b> It was not blowing strongly in order to dry [the waters,] like other strong winds that are known by the name, spirit/wind of God, but rather it was hovering calmly. 

Verse 3

<b>Let there be light:</b> It is known that this light is not the light that shines for [future] generations, and like other things in this section. And for this reason, it is not written concerning this, “and it was so.” Since also from the beginning, this light was only formed, so that it should be hidden for the righteous ones afterwards. So that there should not be a new creation afterwards, which was not [created] during the seven days [of creation,] God [now] said, Let there be light.” And the word, so, is to be understood as an expression of a foundation and base; like in (Proverbs 11:19), “ so (established) is righteousness for life." And for this reason, it is not written here, “and it was so.”

Verse 4

<b> And God saw, etc.:</b> It is not that He did not know before it came to be that it would be good, as he [then] saw after it came to be. But rather also in this did He come to establish the nature [of things], that seeing is better than intellectual belief and understanding of a matter; so much so, that they stated about Moshe in Shemot Rabbah, that Moshe, our teacher, was not energized when the Holy One, blessed be He, said that the Jews had made a calf like [he was] afterwards when he saw [it] with his eyes. Even though it wasn't considered a doubt for him before he saw it; but this is the nature [of things], that seeing with the eyes is more effective than intellectual processes. And here, the Omnipresent, may He be blessed, implanted it into nature in the story of creation, when He saw afterwards that this is how it was. 
<b>The light:</b> And it is not written like in every [other] section, "and God saw that it was good." Since there are two understandings of the phrase, "that it was good:" A) That the thing was good for the goal for which it was needed. Even though its main purpose is not for a good goal, nonetheless according to what is needed, the thing is good; B) It is really good. And behold, in all of the creation, there are several things that are not good, like types of pests, but the Holy One, blessed be He,  saw that for the sake of the creation, it was necessary that it be this way. But light is definitively good. So much, that [it is said about] any good thing that it is light, as it is found (in Ta'anit 7  and Bereshit Rabbah 26), every [time the word,] light is mentioned with Eliyahu, the verse is speaking about rain. And that is because [rain] brings good to the world. (And Ramban in the beginning of Parshat Miketz gives a forced explanation of the matter.) And so, all success is referred to as a 'bright day' and the lack of success, darkness of night.' To the point where the poet made [it] a metaphor and said (Psalms 121:6), At day, the sun does not dim and the moon at night. And later (Genesis 28:15), we explained that the intention is about the time of success and its lack. And this is the expression of Scripture [that tells us] that the Omnipresent saw that light was intrinsically good.
<b>And God separated between the light and the darkness:</b> The meaning of separation has two understandings: A) A partition that separates between two things that are the same or different; B) A spiritual separation between two things - that appear to the human eye to be the same - like the separation between a day that is holy and [one that is] profane, since according to how it appears, what is the difference between one day and the next? Or the separation between [something] pure and impure, and many others. And here it should not be explained in the second way. Since light and darkness are anyway different to our sight, and are the opposite of each other. But rather [it should be explained] in the first [way], that he made a screen to separate. Which means [that this screen is found] in the time that is not light and not darkness. And so the Omnipresent, may He be blessed, implanted that the darkness should not come immediately after the light; but rather that the light should diminish continuously until it becomes dark. And behold, we find in Scripture that sometimes it is written "that separates this from that," and sometimes it is written that "separates between this and that." Meaning that where there is not, in the matter of the separation, an attenuated version of this and that, it is written, "from." And where there is an attenuated version of this and that, in the matter of the separation, it is written, "between this and that." (And see Exodus 8:19 and Exodus 26:33 and in several places, and so is it in every place, by the will of the Highest, may He be blessed.) And here it is according to our words; that the hour that separates them is sometimes closer to the light and sometimes closer to the darkness. And so is the nature of creation in all things that are deemed light and darkness, that there is a [gradual] distinction between them. And in this way man is able to tolerate the difference, according to the way of nature. 

Verse 5

<b>And to the darkness, He called night:</b> The Sages, of blessed memory, explained in the beginning of Tractate Pesachim, that the Holy One, blessed be He, called to darkness and appointed it over the night. [By this,] our Rabbis taught us that we should not say that darkness is only the absence of light, like when - in the middle of the day - we close the windows, it becomes dark. For, if so, it would not be a creation. But in truth, darkness is a creation, on its own as well, as it is written (Isaiah 45:7), "and created the darkness." And it is great distortion to say that darkness is only the absence of light. But rather, God makes both of them, just as He concerns Himself over holiness and impurity. (And see what I have written later, Genesis 27:9.) And to the question, "what does this creation help, behold, even without [its] creation, there would be darkness in the absence of light?," the Sages, of blessed memory, have taught us (in the chapter "<i>Chelek</i>" and in Bereshit Rabbah, Parshat Noach and in the Talmud Yerushalmi in the first chapter) that the light of a fire does not shine during the day in a dark place, [with the same brightness] as it does at night when darkness reigns. And from this, lofty people were able to know while they were sitting in the dark, when it was day and when it was night - in which darkness rules. And as it is with the light and darkness of day and night, so too is it thus with all things that are compared to light and darkness; since there are many bounties that man does not feel so much when he is successful, until he becomes poor and he sees the bounty [that he once had]. And [He], may He be blessed, implanted this into His world.
<b>And it was evening and it was morning:</b> The explanation is that at the time that it was evening here, it was morning in another place on the face of the earth (Ba'al HaMeor, Tractate Rosh Hashanah, Chapter 1). 

Verse 6

<b>And it separated:</b> Meaning a screen that separates.
<b>The water from the water:</b> [This] will yet be explained in the next verse.

Verse 7

<b>And God made the firmament and He separated, etc.:</b> This verse says, 'explain me according to the simple meaning.' Since behold, this verse ends "and it was so," and [so] what is the verse missing? And also, why is it written, "and He separated, etc." - behold the firmament separates automatically? And also the difference [is noteworthy,] that [here] it is written, "between the waters, etc and the waters etc. and not, "the waters, etc. from the water," as in the previous verse. And also here it should have written, "between the waters that are above the firmament and the waters that are below the firmament."  But to begin with, we must understand - is the screen between the waters according to its simple understanding not essentially needed for that day [alone]? Since behold, on the morrow, God said, "let the waters gather, etc." and the lower waters were submerged very much; and if so there was no need for a screen that would separate between them and this is a wonder. But even more difficult is that which is found in Chagigah 15, that Ben Zoma peeked and saw that there is only two or three finger breadths between the higher waters and the lower waters, as it states, "And the spirit of God was hovering over the waters." And [this is] surprising, since, behold they are far from each other like the sky is [far] from the earth. But all of this is explained according to the Midrash Kohelet, that [states] that the firmament is not the lower skies, that are upon the earth, but rather it is a second firmament, within which the luminaries were placed later and [which] is called the firmament of the skies and not just skies, and the Sages, of blessed memory, brought an explicit verse [to prove this] (Nehemiah 9:6), "The skies [and] the skies of the skies and all of their hosts." And according to this, the explanation of, "let there be a firmament in the waters and it will separate the waters from the waters" is understood.  Meaning [that it is] between the waters that are above the lower ones and the waters that are above the higher skies which [comprise] the [actual] firmament. (And similar to this is found in the Guide for the Perplexed 2:30.) (And this is as is found in Shemot Rabbah 33: Above - "let there be a firmament in the waters;" Below - "and the curtain will separate for you between the holy and the holy of holies" (Exodus 26:33). Behold, the separation between the two waters is compared to the separation between the holy and the holy of holies, and this is as I have written.] From this, [we see that] the understanding of the separation of this verse is not a screen that separates, but rather an unusual entity between these waters. And the matter is clear that both of them are not in the form of waters that are visible to us in the lower world. Rather, the waters are purified and provide good and kindness in a different from, that is referred to here with the name, 'water;' and that is [God's] running [of the world]  which emanates great goodness and kindness. And about this [concept of 'water'], it is written (Psalms 42:8), "The depths call to the depths [for the voice of Your water channels]." And it is written (Psalms 65:10), "the stream of God is full of water;" and many [other] verses and midrashim [relate to this], and [this] is called by us, 'the upper waters.' And in truth, everything that is under the second firmament is exactly the running of the world through nature, and the luminaries and the 'constellations' control it and [they] are called 'lower.' And the verse [here] informs us that God separated between running the world through kindness and emanation - which is above the firmament, meaning above the running of the 'constellations;' and the waters that are below the firmament - which is  the running [of the world] exactly by the 'constellations.' And for this reason, it is written "from on top of the firmament," the meaning of which is [to convey] not on top of on top; as is found in in the Chapter <i>Mitsvat Chalitza</i> about the wording of the verse (Deuteronomy 25:9), "from on top of his foot." And so [too] is the understanding of "from on top of the firmament," close to the firmament and not far [from it]. And it comes to make us understand that the intention is not that the upper waters are kindness that appears through complete and absolute miracles. For, if so, there would be no need for a separation from the kindness that is in nature, since it is automatically separated. And so [too], there would be no need to say that the waters that are under the firmament, means the physical waters and the ones that we see; for, if so, they are certainly not comparable to the upper waters. But rather, it is necessary to separate between the running [of the world] through providence and 'through hiding it from nature;' and between the running [of the world] through the 'constellations,' exactly according to nature. And this is what Ben Zoma peeked at and said that there is not more than two or three finger breadths between them; and it is hinted to in the earlier verse "and the spirit of God," meaning His providence, may He be blessed, "was hovering upon the face of the waters," which is the network of kindness in nature. And the meaning of "and God made the firmament" is that He refined and set it up on its essential foundations, (as I have written in Parshat Ha'azinu on the verse [Deuteronomy 32:6], "He is your maker," and in several places), which means that the bottom face of the firmament would extend more towards the lower waters - which is exactly natural - and the upper face would extend more to the higher waters, like any thing that separates between two items. And [the reason that] it is written [here] "between" and "between" is as I have written earlier on verse 4. And this firmament is from the wonders of the Perfect Knowledges, may He be blessed, such that His providence, may He be blessed, is mixed together with nature, for each person according to his deeds. And about this, it is written (Psalms, 19:2), "and the work of His hands is spoken by the firmament;" that the Holy One, blessed be He, always does wonder [and] supervises his creatures and, nonetheless, gives nature dominion together [with His providence]. 

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>From under the skies:</b> Meaning the regular skies, which is perceivable to us, and not below the firmament of the skies, as later on the fourth day.
<b>To one place:</b> Not really one place, but rather several connected places, from which the waters surrounding them, gathered.

Verse 10

<b>He called seas:</b> A gathering [of water] is called a sea, and many gatherings are called seas. This is the simple explanation of the thing. And the exegetical understanding [<i>drasha</i>] is known.

Verse 11

<b>Grass:</b> It is a species, the entire purpose of which is the herb and not the seed. And if so, its main purpose is that the leaf be more distinguishable, and this is the understanding of 'grass' as I have explained in the song of Ha'azinu.
<b>Herbs, that give off seed:</b> The purpose of which is the seed, whether small or large. And behold, it doesn't state now, “according to its specie,” as it states by the fruit of the tree; [meaning] and with it, since it [nonetheless] states in the adjacent verse, “and the earth brought forth grass, herbs that give off seed, according to its specie.” And also [noteworthy] is that the main point of the adjacent verse seems unnecessary. Firstly, we must explain the meaning of, “according to its specie,” or [what it means] when “according to its specie,” is written concerning what grows on the ground or the creations with living souls. And  [the Torah need to say this] because there is almost no species, within which are not included several sub-species. As with wheat, we find in Eichah Rabbah, …................?. And so [too,] there are many in each species. And at the time of the creation, only one wheat plant came, which was the best of that strain, but within it was the potential for several types. And about this, [the Sages] said in (Tractate Rosh Hashanah 11), “all creatures were created with their varieties.” And the main [meaning] here is, as written in Tosefot, that “varieties” [<i>tsivionan</i>] is related to the phrase [<i>tsvi ha'arets,</i>], which means with the greatest possible beauty. But it is not like the Tosefot wrote - that 'they are completely finished' is the meaning of the phrase [that is also] there: “they were [all] created in their stature;” but rather, 'in the most praiseworthy manner,' is its correct meaning. And also included in the meaning of “in  their varieties,” is that every fruit has different times as to when its beauty is most apparent. And with the fruit of the ground, the main beauty is at the time where it has not finished its growth and [at which time] the leaf appears green; which is not the case, when it is completely finished, behold [at that time] the herb withers and is not in its [greatest] beauty. But with a tree, it is not like this – even when the tree is completely finished [for that year], the leaf stays in its beauty; and is included in the understanding of 'varieties' at the time when they appear most beautiful. From here, it follows that it is not relevant to say, “according to its species” then, since, behold in the first coming forth, there was nothing but leaves. And [so] all of the types were the same in [any particular] strain. For this reason, “according to its species”  is not written in the proclamation. Which is not the case with the trees, about which it is written, “according to its species;” since at the time that it first came out, many types were included in it, and all of them were one specie; and for this reason [with trees,] there is no [prohibition] of mixing species (<i>kelayim</i>), as is known [from] the Chapter, “<i>Elu Terefot</i>,”  
<b>Fruit tree:</b> The nature of the tree is different then the seeds, which only grow from planting [them] and not from [placing them] in its trunk; which is not the case with a tree – we can graft a branch and it grows [into] a tree. And this is [the meaning] of 'fruit tree;' within its tree is included the potential for the fruit.
<b>That makes a fruit, the seed of which is in it.</b> Which means the pit, which is the seed that is located in the fruit. And also within in [and not just the tree] is the potential of the tree.
<b>And it was so:</b> That they were formed, like at the time when they are in all their varieties/beauty. And [only] afterward <b>And the earth brought forth, etc.:</b> The [herbs] were [now] completed, such that it would [now] be relevant to say also about them, "according to their species." And since also with the species that are not eaten, there is a seed, [the eventual emergence of their seed differentiated each sub-specie with them as well] (as is found in Bava Metzia 105a concerning weeds, once a seed falls, it falls.) For this reason [in this verse], it is also written with the herbs, "according to its species;" and a second sprouting forth [besides the implied sprouting forth of the previous verse].


Verse 12

<b>And trees that make fruit:</b> Since there are trees that, even though they exist from year to year, nonetheless the [leaves of the] tree do not exist in the winter; and the root in the ground is only [acting upon] the trunk. And the beauty/variety of these species is like with the fruit of the ground, [in that] the leaves wither with the completion of the fruit. For this reason, [the verse] repeats the sprouting forth [with the trees also]. And it is worth knowing that [the phrase,] "according to its specie," includes many more sub-species than [the phrase,] "according to its species," as I have written in the Book of Leviticus 11:12, see there. 

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>To separate:</b> According to their movement, a separation was made between the day and the night. And there is also the dawn and the dusk, which are what separates the two ends [of the day.] And this is [what is meant by] 'between, and between.' (And see the adjacent verse, Genesis 1:17.)
<b>And they will be for signs:</b> We explained, in the Book of Exodus 7:9 and in several places, that its meaning is that it [allows one to] time a natural [process]. And this is impossible without luminaries.
<b>And for appointed times:</b> The change of seasons; cold and heat and so forth, all of which occurs through the luminaries.
<b>And for days and years:</b> To know the change from one day to another, and so [too] with years; all of which is only through the movement of the luminaries.

Verse 15

<b>And they were etc., to shine upon the earth:</b> Since it is possible that their radiance would be visible by having them suspended in the firmament and the radiance would be above, as with the light of a candle. For this reason, [the Torah] explains that [the luminaries were] "to shine upon the earth;" that the light would shine specifically upon the earth.
<b>And it was so:</b> The two luminaries were made by the word of God and were placed in front of Him. And still while they were not yet placed, then <b>And God made, etc.:</b> He arranged them so that they would rule in the midst of the world.


Verse 16

<b>The large luminary to rule the day:</b> He made it to be appointed over that which is in their nature to grow by day, and also [over] the many precious stones and metals that are made during the day.
<b>And the small luminary to rule the night:</b> Over that which grows, and the metals and the stones, the nature of which is to be made at night.
<b>And the stars</b> They too rule, each one, over a specific thing, as is known. 

Verse 17

<b>And He placed, etc.:</b> At the time of the act, the order was reversed from the time of the pronouncement - at first, they came into the firmament of the skies to shine upon the earth, and afterward to govern, and afterward to separate. And the reason [for this] is simple; that at the first instant that the Holy One, blessed be He, placed them in the firmament, they shined upon the earth, but they still did not act upon their rulership until they moved. And in their moving, they impacted upon the earth, and they still had not separated [anything] until the evening.

Verse 18

<b>And to separate between the light and the darkness:</b> By this, the verse adds that besides their coming to separate between the day and the night, they also came to separate between the light and the darkness. Since, in truth, even if the luminaries were equal in their light, nonetheless, they would still be different in their appearance; and day would be divided and distinguishable from night. But rather, they also came to separate between the light and the darkness; since the light of the sun is so strong, that even on a cloudy day [when] the light of the sun is [altogether] covered with clouds, nonetheless the day is light - 'and on a cloudy day, it is all sunny.' Which is not the case with the light of the moon - if the clouds cover the light, behold it becomes dark. And all of this is with regards to the light of the luminaries, but on the first three days, within which the first light was in use, the same separation that came between the night and the day separated between the light and the darkness; that in the absence of light came the night and darkness together.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Upon the earth on the face of the firmament of the skies:</b> There are two types of birds: those that fly upon the earth, [meaning] only close to it; and those that fly high upon the face of the firmament of the skies. And for this reason, [the verb] fly is written in the <i>piel</i> [grammatical form]. And this is not coming to make that which is flying small, as with [the other letters] that become double [in this form] and as is written in <i>HaPirchon</i> under the entry, fly. But here it is impossible to say this, since, behold, it is written "upon the face of the firmament." But rather the meaning of the doubling [of the letter <i>fay</i>] is [to signify] two types of flying. And in Bereishit Rabbah, Chapter 1, there is [someone] who interprets from this that the angels were also created on the fifth [day], since it is written, "firmament of the skies" - and that [refers to] the 'skies of the skies,' as we have written above, Genesis 1:7. And therefore, they interpreted that it is speaking about angels as well. And behold, it is as it is written, upon the face of the skies, upon the face of the firmament of the skies; and this is [frequently] the way of Scripture.

Verse 21

<b>And He created etc., to their species:</b> The verse informs us that even though that at the time of the Holy One, blessed be He's, pronouncement, several species came forth in the water and with the birds; nonetheless, the Holy One, blessed be He, continued to create several species from those that already came out also afterwards. For example, the chicken that came out from the pronouncement, [resulted] in many species with the same characteristics as the chicken and they are all [considered] one species. And so [too] is it with all those mentioned in this verse.  

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>Living [soul] creatures, according to its specie:</b> At the time of the pronouncement, the command was that a living soul should should come out, that has several types that grow like it. Like a lion, that has several types that differ in their from and within [all of] them is the one soul of the lion.
<b>Beast [<i>behema</i>]:</b> The difference between an animal and a beast  is not like Ramban, of blessed memory, wrote; that an animal eats meat; as we find in the second chapter of (Bava Kamma 19b), "and if you want, I will say that it is a deer [that we are speaking about, which is indeed an animal - as opposed to a beast - and nonetheless does not eat meat.]" And about the dog, there is an argument of the Tannaim in Tractate Kelayim, as to whether it is a type of beast or animal; and there is none that eats meat more than it. But rather, the difference is that the animal is naturally wild; if not that he is domesticated, by raising and accustoming him to change his nature. And a beast is the opposite - that he is tame by nature; if not that he is raised in a forest and, [getting] accustomed to this, changes his nature to become wild. (And see what I have written later, Genesis 2:19 and Genesis 3:13 and in Genesis 6:20, and in Leviticus 17:13.)

Verse 25

<b>And God made, etc.:</b> Making is often the finishing touches of a matter and [relates] to the inner form of that thing as I have explained above and in several places. And the explanation of the verse is, that beyond that at the time of God's proclamation, the lion came out - and within him were included several types of lions, according to their external form; God also made their inner forms according to their species, such that the nature of one type of lion is not exactly the same as the nature of another. And nonetheless, they are all species of lions, by way of one detail common to all of them, and based on this detail they are all called lions. And so [too] with the ox, and so forth. All of this is with regards to the creatures of the dry land, and it is not the case with the creatures of the sea - [with them,] it was not like this. And all types of chickens are perfectly similar in character and they are only different in their outer appearance and appear like two types of chickens. And the Creator, may He be blessed, knows the reasons of the [details of the] creation; why the creatures of the dry land were created differently than the creatures of the sea.
<b>The creeping things of the ground:</b> Since there is a difference between earth and ground; as earth is a [more general] category that includes both the dry places of inhabitation and the places of rivers and lakes; which is not the case of ground, which is only dry land - 'examine and find' [this to be true]. And in that there are also several creeping things of the waters, which were [already] grouped under the creation of the swarming things of the water, in the seas; for this reason the verse was precise [to indicate] that in this proclamation only the creeping things of the ground were created.  

Verse 26

<b>"Let Us make man:"</b> God did not say, "let Us make a being like an animal in Our likeness," and afterwards call [him] 'man;' and as it is actually written later in Genesis 5:2. But the phrase, "let Us make man," means that there is no need to <i>give</i> [man] this name; rather his character shows that he is man. But, if so, it is difficult: why is it written afterwards that the Holy One, blessed be He, called their name, man; which implies that there was a need to give a name, and as I wrote regarding the name, sky and earth (<i>shamayim ve'aretz</i>). But rather the matter is like this - that man is different from all the species; since all the species were created in such a way that the species was unitary in its purpose and character; which is not the case for man, who rose in [God's] thought to be of two [types of] character. The one would be cleaving to his God, ready and serving in the world like an angel [does] in the heavens. And the second is [such] that he would be political and [take care of] his [own] needs; even though he would nonetheless do the will of God, it would not be on the level of the first. And behold, according to the first characteristic, he is automatically man (<i>adam</i>) based on the phrase 'I will be similar to the most High' (<i>edmee le'elyon</i>) - meaning that within him are included all the powers of the creation and he rules over everything. And behold, he is like the firstborn son of a king, who rules like the king. And because of this, everyone understands that he is the son of the king, in that they see him ruling over every detail. Which is not the case with a son of the king, who is not the firstborn; and the king [merely] makes him rule over some detail and his fellow over another detail, and so [too] with all those that govern the kingdom. It comes out that all of them together are similar to the king; but each one by himself is only similar to the king when he is given the name [of ruler] over that detail that he governs. And thus is man: the individual of spiritual stature is different then the simple individual. And in the Talmud, Shabbat 112b, they hinted to these two types of men. And it stated in the first version [of a particular statement], "this is not a man;" and in a second version, "this is an example of a man," the explanation [of this being] a man of spiritual stature. But the general human species is called man by the nature of the matter, in that they as a group rule over the entire creation. And this is according to [God's] plan. (And so [too] with the name, Israel, which indicates being higher than the nature of creation and the running [of the world]; it will be explained later in Parshat Vayislach that the whole nation is called Israel, but concerning individuals, some are called by the name Israel and some have not reached this.) And, if so, in the statement, "let Us make man," its explanation is [that it refers to] the general species of man and it is certainly called man even without being given the name; since in this general species is the creation dependent, and in this detail, they are similar to the Creator, may His name be blessed. And Adam (<i>Adam Harishon</i>) specifically, before he sinned, was worthy of being called man without being given the name; but after he sinned, he was <i>given</i> the name, man; and it will be explained further.
<b>"In Our image:"</b> The [meaning of the letter] <i>bet</i> is [to be understood] as in, 'within' or as in, 'with;' since man has a [guiding] 'constellation;' and Rashi has  explained [in] Shabbat61b that it is an angel, and this is the image of God that surrounds him and protects him from danger. (And see later, Genesis 4:14 and in the Book of Numbers 14:9.)
<b>"According to Our likeness:"</b> The image is according to our likeness; and automatically, man - who is clothed in it - is in the likeness of God; and in this is the power [of man].
<b>"And let them have dominion,etc.:"</b> That other creatures do not injure him quickly.
<b>"And in all the earth:"</b> [Refers to] the animals in all parts of the world, and not to the fish of the seas and the birds of the skies, since it is impossible for man to dominate them, except in a place where he can reach; and this is not 'in every place.' Which is not the case with animals, [they are dominated] in all the earth (and see verse 28.)

Verse 27

<b>In the image of God:</b> All of nature was included in him. And from the time that it arose in the thought and word [of God] that there should be nature, then the Omnipresent, may He be blessed, was called by the name, God. And since all of nature is included in man, behold, he is in the image of God. But this is not [the case] except in the man of stature, as [Adam] was before the sin. Afterwards <b>Male and female, He created them:</b> The verse here is not coming to explain about this species that it was more male and female than any of the [other] creatures, but rather to teach us that they are two [separate] creatures like is explained later. And because the male of this species is not at all similar in his character to the female of this species, and as was stated by Kohelet (Ecclesiastes 7:28), "One man out of a thousand I have found, and one woman, etc.," meaning that a man of stature, similar to his Creator, with the image of God, is found one in a thousand. Which is not the case, with women, who only fit the second description of man who is <i>called</i> man.

Verse 28

<b>And He blessed and He said:</b> It is also a blessing and it is also commands of warning; that they should engage in being fruitful and multiplying, in order that the blessing be established. Which is not the case with fish: as they are not subject to command, it is only written, "and he blessed."
<b>"And over all the beasts:"</b> Which is not the case with the fish and the birds; there are many that man [is not able to] reach, as I have written, which [in turn] is not the case [with] beasts; all of them are in the category of [human] dominion.

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b>And behold, it was very good:</b> Besides that every detail was good on its own - according to the will of the Holy One, blessed be He - also grouped together with all of the creatures combined, they were very good; in that every [creature] compensated for the lack of the other. And in this expression <b>Very good:</b> was included [the fact] that there are pests in the world, [since] even though they are not good on their own, nonetheless, they are essential for the good of all the creatures. (And see the explanations of Gr'a, ztz'l, and see what I have written on the Book of Numbers 14:7 on the verse, "the land is very, very good.")

Chapter 2



Verse 1

Onkelos  translates  "perfected"-  Creation was the ultimate in beauty and elegance.  This verse introduces verse 3- "And God blessed the seventh day". The reason God blessed the seventh day is that He was so pleased with the results of His Creation. Just as a man who sees a magnificent structure which gives him great pleasure will mark the day and celebrate it each year, so God loved the world which He created so much that he blessed the seventh day. The Gemara (Rosh Hashana 11a) interprets the end of the verse- "and all their hosts" to mean "in all its splendor" (See H.D. 1:11 tzevaam (hosts) = tzivyonan). At the end of Creation all the species were of the highest quality possible. 

Verse 2

     This is an additional reason. Just as someone who completes construction of his house will rejoice and celebrate even if his house is not so beautiful, so God blessed the day on which He completed His Creation.
This is a third reason. Someone who undertakes working at some task for a period of time will be pleased when he completes that period even if the job is not complete. God undertook to create the world in six days and when that designated time was over He made that day special and blessed it. 

Verse 3

Just as holy objects may not be used for one's personal gain, so also Shabat is holy and may not be used for one's livelihood or any other personal profit. The reason for this is that God rested on that day. The first two reasons mentioned above are not relevant, only the third.  (See H.D. on "Remember the Sabbath day" (Shemot 20:8-11) and "Observe the Sabbath" (Shemot 31:16-17) where I explain that the reason in each case is precisely suited to the subject.)   
The plain meaning is that certain things in Creation were not yet complete. It was God's intention to create those things and then do the changes later. However, a deeper explanation of the word "to do" is that "doing" sometimes implies bringing an object to its ultimate purpose. This stage is the true "creation" of something because without its purpose it cannot be said to exist. (See also Bereshit 39:22 and 41:34.) Now the purpose of Creation is God's glory as Isaiah (43:7) says: "Everyone that is called by My name, and whom I created for My glory, I formed him, yea I made him." I have explained in Bamidbar (14:21) on the verse "However, as surely as I live, and as the glory of the Lord fills the earth" that God truly lives when Creation achieves its purpose and the world is filled with His glory. This goal is reached, however, only when God makes changes in Creation, either temporarily or permanently, which reveal Him as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. God causes those changes which are needed in each hour of need.  All this is included in the words "His work that God created to do." God's personal Providence continues to create changes which bring the world to its ultimate perfection-  being filled with His glory. See also the Introduction to H.D. (d) where I explain that man is commanded to bring glory to God by releasing the forces of nature contained in all things. 

Verse 4

We have just explained that the purpose of Creation is for all people to recognize God as the Creator and Supervisor of the world and so fill the world with His glory. God sits in heaven, as it were, and judges every person according to his actions. All this is due to man because everything depends on his actions. Now we have already explained (H.D. Bereshit 1:26) that there are two distinct types of man. One is elevated man who acts on the earth like the angels act in heaven and the second is practical, worldly man. Both types are needed to make Creation complete. If all men were of the elevated type like Adam before the sin there could be no reward and punishment and God's glory and kindness would never be revealed. So man of the second type is the principle source of God's glory. Even so, the existence of elevated man among the multitude of practical men is also a source of God's glory. Since the two types of man are like different species, they both needed to be created during the sixth day. If Adam had not sinned on the sixth day there would have been no possibility of creating practical man later and the world would not have achieved its purpose. And if only practical man had been created, there would be no possibility of the new species "elevated man" ever coming into existence. If Adam had not been enticed to sin, God would have created a second man of the practical type. As it happened both species were created in the same person- first elevated man and after the sin, Adam himself was transformed into practical man. In this way an ideal world was achieved. All this is implied by the words "These are the results of the heavens and earth at the time of their creation."
Earth and Heaven were 'made' by virtue of their purpose being achieved by Man's transformation from 'elevated' to 'practical' on which everything depended. Earth appears here before heaven because the change which occurred on earth led to the change in heaven where God's Providence is determined by man's actions. The story continues by telling how it came to be that elevated man, who, like the angels in heaven, was not supposed to work the land, was banished from Eden and became practical man who works the land. This change achieved the purpose of creation- revelation of God's glory by His conduct of the world according to man's actions and His attributes. "The heavens are My throne and the earth is My footstool." (Yishayahu 66:1)

Verse 5

The apparent meaning of this verse relates to the field as the source of sustenance for the world. As it says in Kohelet (5:8) "Even the King is subservient to the field," meaning even the king worries about the produce of the field. According to this explanation, we don't understand the message of the verse. But there is a deeper meaning to the word siach (bushes) based on the gemara Avoda Zara(7b), "Siach means prayer as the Torah says (Bereshit 24:63) 'And Isaac went forth to pray (lasuach) in the field'". Tosafot adds that it means fixed prayer also known as avoda shebalev (service of the heart). From the very start of creation God established that earning one's livelihood in the normal way of the world is involved with entreating God for His Providence by prayer or by sacrifices where possible. Both of these are called avoda (service), more than other mitzvot (commandments) of the Torah. Based on the verse (Mishlei 12:11) "He who tills (oved) his soil will be sated with bread" we may explain that all of man's activities can be performed to earn a livelihood or for some other purpose, but tilling the soil is done only to earn one's livelihood. And such is the difference between the avoda of performing other mitzvot and the avoda of prayer or sacrifices. The reward for observing other mitzvot is given in olam haba (the world to come) and also in olam haze (this world) one may receive rewards of wealth or honor, measure-for-measure. The reward for prayer and sacrifices, however, is primarily livelihood, as seen in gemara Ketubot (10b) which interprets the word mizbeach  (altar) as being related to nourishment (see also H.D. Bamidbar xx:xx) and also in gemara Shabat (10a) which states that fixed prayer sustains life. (See also Harchev Davar Bereshit 48:22.) The blessings recited over each type food also promote the abundance of that type as seen in gemara Berachot (35b) which considers someone who eats without reciting the blessing to be stealing from God and from the people of Israel and to be as evil as Yeravam ben Navat .(Based on Mishlei 28:24 " He who robs his father or his mother and says, "This is not a sin," is the companion of a destroyer.") The explanation is that by not reciting the blessing one denies God the pleasure of providing an abundance of that food, in effect stealing from Him and from the people of Israel. And such a person is a companion of Yeravam who prevented the people from bringing sacrifices, thus denying them livelihood. (See Melachim I chapter 12.) 
Based on this introduction we may explain this verse to mean that prayer had not yet been introduced on earth because there was as yet no man to pray.               
Rav Assi in the gemara (Hulin 60) cited by Rashi, resolves the contradiction between this verse and Bereshit 1:12 "And the earth gave forth vegetation" by saying that the vegetation was created on the third day but waited below the surface of the earth until man was created and prayed for rain. He learns from this that God yearns for the prayers of the righteous. The gemara continues with the story of Rabbi Hanina Bar-Papa who planted his garden with all kinds of seeds but nothing grew. Then he prayed for mercy and the rains came and the seeds grew, proving the statement of Rav Assi. According to this gemara, vegetation and fruits appeared on the earth only on the sixth day, after man sinned, was banished from Gan Eden, began to work the land and prayed for rain. Rav Assi's statement, attributing special qualities to the prayers of the righteous for sustenance, seems to be disputed by Medrash Rabbah (Vayikra 31) which says the prayers of all men are accepted by God equally in matters of livelihood and only in other cases of misfortune, God forbid, are the prayers of the righteous more effective. The medrash cites the examples of Sarah, Rivka, and Rachel whom God made barren so that their righteous husbands would pray for them. The answer is that Rav Assi's statement relates to a special case of livelihood, one in which sustenance is provided by a miraculous change in nature. The story of Rabbi Hanina Bar-Papa must be understood to refer to a situation in which all the other gardens grew normally and only Rabbi Hanina's did not, against the laws of nature, until he prayed.  Rav Assi applied this lesson to our verse as well, since God Himself created the vegetation so it certainly should have grown. God changed nature so the vegetation would not grow because He yearned to hear the prayers of the righteous.    All this is the opinion of Rav Assi, but that is not the plain meaning of the verse. The Ramban writes that all the vegetation appeared on the earth on the third day, but did not begin to produce new plants until man was created and began to pray. One may add also that the vegetation was created on the third day in its full height and beauty, and only after man prayed did it begin to grow gradually larger.  
That is why there was none of the usual plant growth. 
Because there was no man to engage in avoda (work/service) meaning prayer. 

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>And the serpent was more cunning, etc.:</b> Rashi explained in the name of Midrash Rabbah that it was jealous of them, in that it saw them copulating together and desired her. But this is a wonder! As behold, every creature only desires its species, as it is found in Tractate Bava Metzia 91b: "Its species - it is drawn after its species." And behold the serpent was not lacking its female. And if it was on account of their having intercourse before the eyes of all, the serpent also did not know shame. Rather the matter is that it sensed that the clinging of the women to her husband was not like its female to it, which only occurred at the time of arousal for copulation. And that is only by happenstance and preparation for the thing. Which was not the case with the woman, who constantly clung to him: Given that she was the bone of his bones, the clinging was even more than a brother and sister. For they too are one flesh. However they are nevertheless not truly so like the first woman to Adam, who was like a limb to the head. And it was jealous of this. <b>And behold the matter is understood</b> that the serpent never spoke. For if it had originally spoken but was cursed to be dumb and silent, why is this curse not mentioned? Moreover, speech depends on intelligence, and as per Rashi's explanation of, "and so man became a living soul" Genesis 2:7) - with speech and intelligence. And likewise did Onkelos translate, "With a speaking spirit." Behold man was unique in this virtue. However it was the constellation of the serpent that clothed himself with jealousy and spoke at that time from the throat of the serpent. As every species from all that was created - even the botanic - has a constellation; and that is the angel that is appointed upon that species to protect it and grow it, so that it not cease from the world. And this is like the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, "You have no [blade of] grass below without its constellation above striking it and saying to it, 'Grow!'"  And the constellation of the serpent was like [the serpent]; as it was jealous of man's clinging to his Creator, may He be blessed. And it is just as we explained in the previous section, that Adam clung so greatly to God, like a portion that always yearns for its source; which is not the case with an angel. It is just separated and it is not clinging and yearning for His light, may He be blessed, except for at the time designated for song and that which is similar. And the angel was jealous about Adam; and the physical serpent about his wife. And [about] that which all of this is not explained in Scripture, the Ramban has already written, in Parashat Bechukotai - and we brought it earlier (Haamek Davar on Bereishit 1:1) - that regarding things that are not grasped by everyone, the Torah only spoke about it by hinting.
<b>Even though God said,</b> "You shall surely eat from every tree of the Garden" (Genesis 2:16), nevertheless...
<b>You will not eat from all the trees of the Garden:</b> And the intent is that, in truth, Adam and Chavah had still not eaten anything. And that is because Adam - even though he was at that time in a place that it was necessary to use his senses for eating and for sex, according to the need of the creation which was created to be settled - nevertheless, they were like Moshe, our teacher, after he descended from the mountain. As he also had use of his senses for eating like all of Israel. And even regarding sex, had the Holy One, blessed be He, not warned him, "and you, stand with Me," he would not have separated himself from [his wife]. But he was nevertheless very close, to be clinging to the Divine Presence anytime he wanted. And at the time that he was clinging to the Divine Presence, he did not desire to eat at all. And likewise was it with Adam, so he no longer desired to eat. And so too was the woman clinging to Adam, the life of her spirit. So they were satiated from love. Hence the serpent came with a temptation: That, behold, the world and its fullness was not created for nothing; and it is not the will of God that they not need the pleasures of the world. And if so, it is not fitting that they be engrossed in the love of God and in clinging. As it reduces and disturbs all the physical pleasures and it is against God's will. As behold, He said, "You shall surely eat from every tree of the Garden." And the temptation of the evil impulse is like this in every generation, as is well known. At first, it removes the clinging to the Torah through [the fulfillment] of some commandment or something else which is truly correct for other people. And after it drags him from the study hall, it continues to proceed and tempt.

Verse 2

<b>From the fruit of the trees of the Garden we may/shall eat:</b> In truth, the clinging of the woman to Adam was only at the time that she stood with him, as is the nature of a portion that yearns for the group at the time it sees it. And at that time that the serpent spoke with her, Adam had gone away from her. So she felt a desire to eat, and said that she would eat. And regarding the clinging of Adam to his Maker, she did not feel it. Therefore she said, "'Certainly 'we shall eat.'" And she said, "From the fruit of the tree of the Garden"; and not like the language of God, "from every tree of the Garden" (Genesis 2:16) - which implies even the benefit from the wood, as I wrote above (Haamek Davar on Genesis 2:16). And that is since Adam told her that she only eat the fruit; given that she did not know to be careful with the destruction of the tree, since she did not have human knowledge.

Verse 3

<b>But of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the Garden:</b> And she did not specify it - "But from the tree of knowledge of good and evil" - since Adam had not explained to her that it was the tree of knowledge of good and evil. As he was concerned, lest she pine to eat it. For only Adam, who clung to God with love, did not desire to do good for itself, since God's will was that he not know good and evil. But Adam had to concern himself about revealing the cause and the reason to the woman, who did not know about the love of God. Hence he simply said to her, "of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the Garden." And do not ask, "If so, the tree of life is also included in this." As, in truth, with this, we can understand that which Onkelos translated above (Onkelos Genesis on Genesis 2:9), "and the tree of life was in the middle of the Garden; and the tree from which the fruit, if eaten, gives knowledge (to differentiate) between good and evil"; and he did not explain about eating the fruit of the tree of life. However it is shown from this that the tree of life does not [have] fruit at all, but rather leaves for medicine. [This is] like the way of [the true] purpose, which is not pleasurable to the palate, but is rather pleasure and enjoyment of God. That is not the case with the tree of knowledge of good and evil - the purpose brings physical enjoyment. Because of that, when Adam said, "But from the fruit of the tree," she understood through it, that she was only prohibited from the tree that had fruit in it. But it appears to me that Adam was not concerned about this - that she not also eat from the tree of life. However it was worthwhile to distance her from that place. And because of that, he also said, "and do not touch it." And we have already explained that this is hinted to in the word of God, that He forbade [the tree] also for benefit. But [Adam] explicitly warned about this, and said, "lest you die." As he could not say, "since you will die" certainly, as they would not die for the touching alone, but rather lest they would come from this to eating. And all the more so [is this the case] according to our words - that he warned her about the two trees, lest she eat from the tree of knowledge and die. But she did not know the intent, as to why he used an expression of doubt (lest). So she just said that Adam told her, "lest you die." And from this, the serpent found room to deny [it]. And note that Adam said to her, "But of the fruit," because only from them is there a concern about death .

Verse 4

<b>You certainly will not die:</b> How is it possible that there is a doubt for the Creator? Hence He is only being like someone intimidating and threatening because he does not want [it]. And such is the temptation of the evil impulse at all times - that the punishments will not be so great.

Verse 5

<b>And the eyes of both of them were opened:</b> To see what is fit to be the way of the world, and what is not fit. Since even though the love of God wizens greatly, it nevertheless diverts the eye from the way of the world. And that is as it is found in Eruvin 54b, "They said of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat that he would sit and engage in Torah study in the lower marketplace while his cloak was lying in the upper marketplace." And because of that, the man did not understand that it was not proper to stand naked in front of God. And all the more so did the woman not have [understanding of this] at all, but rather only [acted out of] love for her husband.
<b>And you will become as gods, knowing good and evil:</b> Like the angels who intend [to act] in the name of God, but are separate. And their service of the Creator, may He be blessed, is because they know that their mission is [the source of] their existence in the world, but after they do their mission, they are nullified. And you shall also be knowing [what is] good for yourselves and evil (bad) for yourselves.

Verse 6

<b>That the tree was good for food:</b> Given that she was only warned by Adam about the fruit, she permitted herself to take from the tree (bark) and tasted its good taste. And from that, she understood how great was the taste of the fruit. 
<b>And that it was desirable to the eyes:</b> They explained in [Bereishit] Rabbah, Chapter 19:5, "From here, [we understand] that it was good for the eyes." It added to the understanding of these words - that they do not have a straightforward meaning, since desire is rooted in the heart and not in the eyes. Rather the explanation is, for the sake of the eyes. So it is desirable for the sake of the eyes, since it is good for the eyes, like its literal meaning - that the eyes would see more brightly than they did [before]. And this is also included in the statement of the serpent, "your eyes will be opened" - that the eyes would be opened to see from further.
<b>And that the tree was enticing to contemplate:</b> As she acquired intellect from it. And it is as it is found in [Bereishit] Rabbah (19:5), "From here, [we understand] that it added wisdom." And the matter is like its literal meaning, that human knowledge was added to her by eating from the tree. And it is as I wrote adjacently, that the amazing wisdom that Adam had until now was not natural human intellect. Rather it was because he clung to his God that he grasped everything though the holy spirit; but he did not have human wisdom. It follows that the woman - who did not at all know from clinging to, and love of, God - did not have human knowledge. Because of that, they did not know embarrassment from walking around naked. But she saw that human intellect was added to her from the tree of knowledge. 
<b>And she took of its fruit and she ate:</b> And she could not strengthen herself over the enticement to attain these three things, and also ate from the fruit.   
<b>And she also gave it to her husband with her:</b> Since at the time of her eating, her husband was not with her, as I wrote above. For had he been with her, he would not have allowed her to get into this at all - on account of his clinging to God. But he was not there then, and she did what she did. And with his coming, she gave it to her husband with her as well.

Verse 7

<b>And the eyes of both of them were opened:</b> He also acquired strong physical sight. Also...
<b>And they realized that they were naked:</b> Natural human intellect was added to them, without clinging. For, in truth, from that moment, he lost his clinging to God and become like a person [today]. However he was a great sage, according to the nature of this tree that adds human intellect. So he understood that it is not honorable to walk around naked. And they also knew how to sew fig leaves with human intellect. But it was all from human intellect and knowledge. And hence both of them were on one level: He descended from his level of wisdom of the holy spirit and [descended to the level of] natural wisdom with human knowledge; whereas she ascended to human knowledge. In fact, she became smart [before] the man. And that is like the nature of a woman throughout the generations - that she arrives at her complete intelligence more quickly than a man. Because of that, she becomes an adult at twelve, and a man at thirteen. However the man became wiser than the woman with human knowledge, since he [drank] the wine which is the essence of the fruit; whereas she ate the grapes. 

Verse 8

<b>And they heard the voice:</b> The rule is that in a place where, relative to the recipient, it is not fit for there to be a revelation of the Divine Presence, but the time nevertheless necessitates a revelation of the Divine presence, there is a sounding of a [loud] voice. It is like the metaphor of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, "A coin in an [otherwise empty] barrel calls, 'Kish, kish' (makes much noise)." And for that reason, they said in Sotah 9b concerning Shimshon, that the Divine Presence was beating in front of him like a [bell] clapper. And that is because he was not properly prepared - regarding the separation from desire for a woman - for the attainment of the holy spirit; but he attained the holy spirit nevertheless. So behold, up until now, Adam was clinging to the Divine Presence; and the woman did not see or know what the revelation of the Divine Presence was at all, but was rather like a monkey. However, from the time they ate from the tree of knowledge, both of them understood the greatness of that thing.
<b>Moving in the Garden at the breeze/to the direction of the day:</b> It is like the explanation of Rashi, to the side of the sun. The explanation is that the sun is called, day - like the language of the Gemara, Pesachim 12, "the sixth hour, the day, stands at the meridian." And Rashi explained, [day, as] the sun. And that is Scripture's explantion in I Chronicles 26:17, "north of the day, four" - meaning north of the rising of the sun. And see what I wrote in the Book of Numbers 28:3, according to the Sages, may their memory blessed - that it is to the side of the sun. And the movement of the Divine Presence was exactly towards the direction of the day, to teach him knowledge. Not like the man was until then, as Adam's practices in the world were above the governance of the sun, like those of Moshe and Israel in the wilderness. But now he was under the sun, and like the language of Scripture in Ecclesiastes 1:3, "What profit has a man of all his toil wherein he toils under the sun." However the providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, is nevertheless over nature itself, that it should be according to the acts of people - as I wrote earlier concerning the making of the firmament on the second day. And that is why it is written, "moving" (<i>mithalech</i>), and not, "going" (<i>holech</i>). It is in fact because the acts of people direct the providence of God over the day, which is the governance over nature. And this is referred to with the <i>mitpael</i> [verb structure], as it is written in Parashat Bechukotai (Leviticus 26:12), "And I will move (<i>hithalachti</i>) among you" - and it is explained there. And in the Book of Samuel (I Samuel 12:2) the explanation of, "behold, the king moves (<i>mithalech</i>) before you," is also that the knowledge of the people is what draws the king to walk in front of them to the place that they are [moving].
<b>And the man and his wife hid themselves (lit., himself):</b> It should have been, "hid themselves!" Moreover, the words, "in front of the Lord, God," are superfluous. So it comes to teach us that each one hid on their own, in order to protect their nakedness with branches and leaves of the trees, so that their nakedness not be seen at the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, would stand with them. But if they would sit together, it is impossible that the leaves would cover so much that her flesh would not be seen, since it is nakedness also for Adam. Hence they distanced themselves from one another and only needed that they not be truly naked, revealing their [essential] nakedness. And that is the meaning of, "in front of the Lord, God": Since they understood that they would would meet Him. However they did not flee and run away because of fear of the punishment, but rather because of the fear of God and the awe of His glory, to stand in front of Him while revealing nakedness. 

Verse 9

<b>And He called:</b> Every, "and He called," is an expression of love - as it is taught at the beginning of Torat Cohanim. (And see what I wrote on the book of Exodus 8:21.) And it is found explicitly in Vayikra Rabbah, Chapter 1:9, "'And He called to Moshe' (Leviticus 1:1) - and is it not also written about Adam, 'And the Lord God, called to Adam?'" It is clear from this that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not punish [Adam] as someone volitional and transgressing contemptuously. For behold, God knew that it was on account of the woman. So it is from this reason that He did not punish him with death on that day as He had warned him, but rather judged him as [someone] inadvertent. And that which He said to him (Genesis 3:19), "until your return to the ground" - He did not say it as a punishment. As behold, [even] without a punishment, man returns to the dirt by nature - except by way of the supernatural power of the tree of life; or [with] one who is above nature, like Chanoch or Eliyahu. But the nature of man is to return to his dirt (and as I wrote above 2:9); and the punishment was only, "on the day that you eat from it, etc." (Genesis 2:17) - which only implies if he ate [it] volitionally. This is the straightforward understanding of the matter, even though it is known that there are other opinions about this. But the opinion of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, about the understanding of, "and He called," is as I have written.  

Verse 10

<b>And I was afraid because I was naked:</b> He explained that he did not run away because of fear that he would be punished, but rather because he was naked and it is not respectful to the Divine Presence. And that is awe of the sublime.

Verse 11

<b>From the tree whereof I commanded you:</b> And He did not say, "From the tree of knowledge." As in truth there is nothing in the tree of knowledge to cause him to sin, and that it have impure properties in it, like in all the types of non-kosher food, <i>orlah</i> (fruit from a three less than three years old) and that which is similar. Rather it is that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded man to be on that level of clinging to Him, which is impossible when he attains human knowledge - unless it is with great exertion, like [with] the few people of great stature. And, if so, the impropriety is that he transgressed a command.

Verse 12

<b>And I ate:</b> This is like a confession; as if he is saying, "I sinned, as I ate." And it is like Shaul said (I Samuel 15:24), "I have sinned, as I have transgressed, etc. for I feared the people." Behold he intermingled the apology and the confession together. So too did Adam apologize - that he did not, God forbid, eat [it] contemptuously, but nevertheless, "Behold I sinned and I ate." And likewise is the explanation about the statement of the woman, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate" (Genesis 3:13).

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>To the serpent:</b> God did not speak to the serpent but rather to his constellation; and that is like [talking to] the serpent itself.
<b>From all the beasts and from all the animals of the field:</b> As a beast, which is domesticated; and an animal, which is wild - are different in their sustenance: What is good for this type is lacking for that type, and what is good for that type is lacking for this type. The food of domesticated beasts is the responsibility of its owners, so the owners prepare everything that is tasty and useful for it. Whereas the main pleasures of the animals are prey and meat, which it only scarcely and occasionally attains  And when it does not have [such food], it perforce nourishes itself with that which is disagreeable to it. In exchange for this, the animal moves with its head raised, according to its worth. For it does not have a yoke upon it, which is not the case with a beast - its head is bent and subservient to man. So the Holy One, blessed be He, cursed the serpent - that it should have both of the disadvantages together; and even the disadvantage itself be worse than with the two of them. So the explanation of, <b>on your belly you shall crawl</b>, is that it is the disadvantage in the beast, but much worse than with the beast. <b>And dust you shall eat all the days of your life.</b> The serpent also has a food it desires. As it is found in Avodah Zarah 29a - that it is prepared to give its life for wine, water and milk. But it does not attain this pleasure, so its food is perforce only dirt. So it is worse than the animal, because when [an animal] does not attain prey, it eats grasses and leaves - as I wrote above 1:30 - whereas the serpent's default food is dirt. This is the straightforward meaning of the thing. But in the Gemara, Yoma 75a, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, additionally explained what is included from, <b>all the days of your life</b> - since it is superfluous. So they explained that even when it does attain its delicacies, it tastes the taste of dirt, which spoils the taste of the food that is most tasty to it. And another [opinion there is] that it is not satisfied until it eats dirt. And with this, it is worse than an animal - for if it has prey, it is not forced to eat something that is not tasty to it.

Verse 15

<b> And I will put enmity between you and the woman:</b> It should be, "There shall be!" But it is since the serpent is actually found among women, as it is found in Bereishit Rabbah, Chapter 98:14 - and also in her sleep, it loves to suckle her milk and does not hurt her - however when she awakens, she runs away from it; and it also runs away, as if he became her enemy. And this is the metaphor, "I will put": After it loved her and was used to being with her, it became her enemy. 
<b>He shall strike you on the head:</b> First he will try to strike you.
<b>And you shall strike him on the heel:</b> In the end, you will also attempt to strike him. But without that, a serpent does not hurt without a "charm" from above.

Verse 16

<b>Your <i>itzabon</i>:</b> Its explanation is not that it is an expression of pain, but rather an expression of toil - as in, "From all toil (<i>etzev</i>) there is some gain" (Proverbs 14:23). As even though they explained it in the Gemara, Berakhot (30b), Chapter 4, as an expression of lowly spirit - nevertheless the Sages, may their memory be blessed, explained in Bereishit Rabbah, Chapter 89:2, that it is an expression of toil. So the explanation of, your <i>itzabon</i>, is your toil - that you should toil and labor. This is as it is written with Adam (Genesis 3:17), "with <i>itzabon</i> shall you eat of it." However with the woman, the labor is not for sustenance, since it is surely the husband that sustains her. Rather it is in her nature to serve her husband, or to labor in order to attain jewelry and that which is similar.  
<b>You will give birth to children with <i>etzev</i>:</b> Both birth and the toil of raising [children] most of the time are included in this. And so did the Sforno explain.
<b>Your longing will be for your husband:</b> According to the straightforward understanding, the woman always yearns to find favor in the eyes of her husband. And this is the exact explanation of the term, "to your husband." And so did the Sages, may their memory be blessed, explain in Bereishit Rabbah 20:7: "There are four longings. The longing of a woman is only for her husband. The longing of the evil impulse is only for Kayin and his friends." And the explanation about this is that it yearns that they follow it. "The longing of rain is only for the land." The explanation is that the land benefit and be saturated from the rain. "And the longing of the Holy One, blessed be He, is only for Israel" - that they should follow Him. In this way, man is distinct from woman: The man does not concern himself that he should find favor in the eyes of his wife, but all of the woman's [energy] is that the man should be pleased with her. And if so, she is auxiliary to him.
<b>And he will rule over you:</b> Even though she subjugates herself for free, he nevertheless rules.

Verse 17

<b>Because you listened to your wife, etc.:</b> He did not begin [by] saying, "Because you ate from the tree, etc." Rather, because He did not punish him like He said - "for on the day you eat from it, you will surely die" (Genesis 2:17) - hence God explained to him that if he had eaten contemptuously, it certainly would have been fit to punish him immediately. And this is like the way of Scripture with Nadav and Avihu, "when they came close before the Lord and died" (Leviticus 16:1). Such that it was their coming close before the Lord that caused them to die immediately for their sin, since they brought a strange fire; and it is explained there. If so, also with Adam who was then standing there close in front of the Lord - if he had sinned volitionally, it would have been fit that he would die immediately. Hence God said to him, "Because you listened to your wife, etc." - and that is only inadvertent - your punishment is only that which is required according to your status now. 
 <b>The ground will be cursed for your sake (<i>beavurkha</i>):</b> The literal meaning of every, "for the sake of (<i>beavur</i>)," is for his good, so that it be like this. And it is like in, "for the sake of your blessing me" (Genesis 27:19). And here too, its literal meaning is, for your good. For after the love of God left you, the best thing before you is that the ground be cursed, and you come to, "with toil you shall eat from it" - with labor and with much work. 
<b>All the days of your life:</b> That you should not think that there only be a need for the working of the land the first time. About this, He said, "all the days of your life." And all of this is for man's good, that he should not go away from the paths of God. And it is like they said (Avot 2:2), "Toil in both of them causes iniquity to be forgotten." And it is like I wrote in Parashat Shelach on the verse, "the Land is very very good" (Numbers 14:7), see there.

Verse 18

<b>And thorns:</b> There will be times when the toil will not benefit you. However you will not die of hunger, but rather, "you will eat, etc."

Verse 19

<b>By the sweat of your face, etc.:</b> Until here, He was speaking about the labor until the wheat berries form. But now, He is adding that also from the time of harvesting until [it becomes] bread, it comes with sweat. For baking is included as a type of work, and it causes much sweat. 
<b>For you are dust:</b> We have already explained that this is not a punishment. And, just the opposite, God is explaining to him that He is not punishing him with death, since he did not eat volitionally. Rather, death is natural, since you are surely dust, etc.

Verse 20

<b>And the man, etc.:</b> Now, after he had sensed about her that her nature had changed. As she had [previously] been clinging only to him, but now she had her own sense of good and evil. Hence, he called her Chavah.
<b>Because she was the mother of all the living (<i>chai</i>):</b> If we will explain [it as], "the mother of all people, the expression, "living," is not exact; and is only man called living? Moreover, why did he call her this name after she ate from the tree of knowledge. Rather the explanation of, "all the living," is like that which the Rosh wrote (on Berakhot, Chapter 6, Paragraph 8) in explanation of the blessing, "Who blessed souls, etc. to give life with them to the soul of all the living" - that its meaning is that it is not the essence and necessity of man's life, but rather that which comes as a delight. And similar to this did we explain the meaning of, living, a few times earlier (on Genesis 2:10) - that its meaning is joy and the fulfillment of desire. And behold until the woman had human knowledge, she only wanted what was necessary to live, like a beast. Now that she attained human intellect, "she was" - the explanation of which is, she became - "the mother of all the living," [meaning] she brought forth all the delights of people. And because of that, she is called, "Chavah," and not, Chayah - since it is closer to the words of the reason: That is because most of the time, that delight changes into an obstacle and something that causes damage to people. And they said similarly to this in Bereshit Rabbah (20:11) - that it is [related] to the expression <i>chiviya</i>, meaning a snake that bites the heel.  

Verse 21

<b>Garments of skins and clothed them:</b> The explanation of the verse is that the garments were not made in such a way that they would dress themselves. Rather the Holy One, blessed be He, dressed them. Meaning, they were made on their flesh, so that they would not come to revealing nakedness at the time that they were dressing themselves and would not be able to cover themselves among the leaves of the trees, as was the case at that time - as I wrote above (Haamek Davar on Genesis 3:8).

Verse 1

The happenings of one's life are called "generations" in several places. But in this place it is different, for it is written, " this Book". The meaning is that the verse is recounting how it was with him at the moment he was born and on that same day, and the changes that befell him from the moment he was born until the end of the day are like an entire book, for such changes as these [normally] take many years. All of this comes to teach us wisdom - how it is that a person can become corrupted in just a single day. And such we find stated in the Torat Kohanim Parshat Kedoshim, wherein Ben Azzai states that this verse is the major principle of the Torah.

<b>Nine hundred.</b> Sometimes the hundreds are written first and sometimes the units.

There are exceptions to this rule, however; see Rashi 23:1.

THIS ONE WILL CONSOLE US - One might be tempted to say that this word is from the root “console,” and Rashi has rebutted this on the basis that the name “Noach” is not consistent with this root and has explained that it is derived from the root “rest.” According to Rashi, the word here is inexact. However, one need not to resort to this explanation, it is possible to understand the word in both senses.  “Comfort” only applies to ongoing permanent tragedies, and not ones that arise from human activity and evil that arose during the days of Noah.  Similarly, “rest” does not apply to the land, which was permanently cursed by God (since the land remained in this state even after the flood.)  The name “Noah” includes both roots – “comfort” and “rest.” This is why the word is spelled nun-chet without a third letter, so that it can be considered a cognate of both roots.  “This one will console us” can be understood in both senses, similar to Rashi’s explanation.

Verse 3


My breath shall not abide in man forever. "The spirit of man" is that individual spirit which God implanted into each person, that is, human intellect. A degree above this is one who merits the spirit to understand Torah. Be aware that someone whose desires overcome his intellect, which is the "spirit of man," this normal desire becomes second nature until it destroys his intellect and the "spirit of man" and his intellect then changes to base desire. This will be explained more later on.  This is what is meant by God saying "my spirit will not dwell," similar to what our sages say (Berakhot 61b) "A righteous person is judged by his good inclination and an evil person is judged by his evil inclination." "Judged" means that it guides him and he perceives the world and decides what to do based on it.  And in God's language "will not dwell" means, my spirit will not guide man, that is, the spirit which I implanted in each person which is the human intellect.

<b>That He had made man.</b> Note that it does not say that He repented that He <i>created</i> man, but only that He <i>made</i> him — i.e. that He allowed him to become so numerous.

Within his tent -  the expression should have been "in his tent"; "within" means in the middle of, just as "within the garden" (Gen. 2:9) and in a few other places. And it is not typical to put one's place of sleeping in the middle of the tent, rather, to one side. And this appears to have been a cause for the deed of his younger son, who "played" with him as he was asleep due to his drunkenness. This is beside the known drash [ed. note: castration].

Yet that there is a practical difference between one who does this mitzvah because this is the Holy One's will, and not due to human [natural] feelings; and between one whose common sense forces him to. So, Shem, who did this mitzvah because it was a mitzvah, was blessed to have among his children people who serve Hashem and His Torah, even up to having the laws of nature apply to them through HaVaYaH Himself, and this is why the text says "Blessed is Hashem the God of Shem" - behold the Holy One of Blessing Himself leads the ways of nature and He is Blessed and Magnified through nature [or through Shem / through the one who does God's will, text unclear.]

Chapter 11



Verse 1

...One language - that is what caused the first sin. This is that they agreed to stop in one single place. And this is against the will of God that said to "fill the land and replenish it" - that is, to walk to all its places, since the land was created to be settled.
...And the same words - The text did not explain what those words were, rather, it leaves as a hint,  as explained in midrashim. But the words themselves are not explained by the text, it just tells us that they were the same words, to teach us that it wasn't because of the content of the words themselves that the Holy One of Blessing was distressed. They were what they were, and in its simplicity there is not sin, and on the contrary all appears well. But here what happened is that all thought the same thing, and this came to be the problem of the settlement.

Verse 2



Verse 3

Burn them thoroughly - There is no place in the Text where something is told that has no impact in the story [therefore, ask:] Why do I care if they were using stones; bricks; were constructing using wood; or made their brick by burning? Even before the Flood it is written "and afterward he build a city" (Genesis 4:17)! And it appears that here there is a hint regarding our sages' tradition that Avraham Avinu was thrown in the fiery furnace - and from the verse "that took you out from Ur Kasdim" (Genesis 15:7) there is no real proof, since from the simple meaning it is simply the name of a place, as it is written "in the land of his birth, Ur Kasdim" (Gen. 11:28) "and went out with them from Ur Kasdim" (Gen. 11:31) etc. But from here we have a hint to the issue of what obviously was happening before the tradition saying that they threw Avraham Avinu into the fiery furnace: they did not make the furnace for this need [of bricks], rather this was the fiery furnace (in Daniel, see Dan. 3:6) done for the need of [burning] people. And the Text is informing that this furnace was for the need of the city and the tower, and from this we understand how big and deep was this furnace, and from this furnace Avraham Avinu was saved.

Verse 4

And its top in the sky - It is obvious that you should not think that this would be one city to the whole world, rather they thought that the other nearby cities  would be subjects to that city that had the tower, that they would be able to see from it to the distance, over all their settlement, so that no one would be able to separate themselves and go to another land. That's why they needed its top reaching the sky.
And we will make a name for ourselves - people were set up to watch and be in charge of the thing, and they were army chiefs in charge of punishing those who would cross, since if this is not the case there would be no need for the tower. And all that was due to fear/suspicion.
Lest we be scattered over all the face of the earth - However, we must understand why they feared that someone might leave to another land. And it is understood that this was related to the uniformity that was among them. And since the opinions of people are not identical, they feared that people might abandon this philosophy and adopt another. Therefore they sought to ensure that no one would leave their society. And one who veered from this uniformity among them was judged with burning, just as they did to our forefather Abraham. And the "same words" can also be seen as the fact that they would kill whoever did not think like them. And more is explained on verse 6.

Verse 5



Verse 6

They are one people. The explanation of "people" is that they all follow one custom [minhag], as it is written later on Gen. 28:3 in the explanation of 'and you shall be a congregation of peoples'.
If this they began to do. This is but the beginning of the transgression: they want to remain in one place.
And now nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do. If they finish the tower they will come to a second thought, to prevent by force other thoughts than this one. And this is a thing [that brings] killing, and violent destruction of the settlement, and it does not help that at this moment they are together with one opinion.

And it was not as he had feared [upon hearing of their comparison to dust], lest they be small of worth. 
If you will be able to count them: Because although there are in all the nations of the world men of stature, who bring light to their nations like stars, but they were few in number then in comparison to the amount of the masses. This is not so with the offspring of Avraham; there are great people much more than the amount of the masses, as we have written in the book of Devarim on the verse, "Not because of your being more than all the other nations."

And you shall be the father of many...
Nations: For until this point, Abraham had called out the name of God and converted some people, but this was only those people who converted entirely and entered under the category of servants of God in God's Torah that Abraham had taught them. And this is as it is taught in the Gemara Tractate Sanhedrin (99b) and in Avodat Kochavim (page 9) that the meaning of "the souls that they made in Charan" is that he taught them Torah and this is impossible for the whole world. And from the beginning, the only purpose was to "establish the borders of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel."(Devarim 32:8). But it was the desire and the goal that all of the nations should know God. "And the idols would entirely disappear"(Isaiah 2:18) And it was for this thing that God warned Abraham that his desire should be to the depths of his understanding to be a father of many nations, to make them know God. And In this he was called a  father of many nations, like a father who establishes his son with correct ideas and by this the previous statement of God is clarified.

Verse 1

<b>And the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken:</b> The doubling of the statement is a wonder. And Rashi's explanation (Rashi on Genesis 21:1) about this does not handle it. As, in fact, the birth was already stated in God's utterance (<i>maamar</i>) as well. And just the opposite, in God's speech (<i>dibbur</i>), Sarah as not mentioned at all. And it would have been possible to understand that it was about Yishmael that God spoke. Rather [the correct explantion] is the thing we have explained (on Genesis 18:12-15) - that the Holy One, blessed be He, was upset with Sarah for her laughing and being in doubt about that which she did not see any difference in the face of Avraham, like she found in herself - that she had been rejuvenated. And because of this, she was punished with the story of Avimelekh - as will still be explained - that a doubt was born in people's minds about the essence of the birth, whether [the child] was not from Avimelekh: Even as there was no longer a wonder with herself, because everyone saw her youth; this was not the case with Avraham, who still looked like a hundred year old man. And this is the meaning of, "and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken." And speech (<i>dibbur</i>) is an expression of harshness, as is known - [here] meaning that He did to her, that about which He was angry with her. And it ends (Genesis 21:2), "And [Sarah]  conceived and bore Avraham a son in his old age." But it is not written, "in her old age," as behold, she had become a youth. However the nature of Avraham's body did not change, but she nevertheless bore him a son. 

Verse 2

<b>At the set-time of which [God] had spoken, etc.:</b> This too is part of the [harsh] speech (<i>dibbur</i>) that came as a punishment. As it would have been good to her that she not give birth for another year, so it would remove the doubt [about the child's paternity]. But because of the punishment, she give birth at that set-time that He had spoken.

Verse 3

 <b>Who was born to him:</b> The lengthier expression than what is written (Genesis 16:15) regarding Yishmael - "the name of his son whom Hagar bore" - is coming to teach through this that at the time of the naming, Avraham publicized that [Yitzchak] was his son, to remove [any doubt] from people's minds.

Verse 4

<b>As He had commanded:</b> [He commanded] the laws of circumcision orally; as it is found in Berakhot 5 (a), "'and the commandment' (Exodus 24:12) - that is the Mishnah (meaning the oral teaching)." There were several commandments like this to Avraham, our father, such as [doing the circumcision] specifically during the day, and not at the beginning of the night of the eighth day.  

Verse 5

<b>And Avraham was a hundred years old:</b> But it is no longer written, "and Sarah was ninety years old'; for behold, she had already reverted to being a youngster.

Verse 6

<b>God has made laughter for me:</b> [God's] trait of [strict] justice has made laughter for me - meaning, <b>all who hear of it will laugh for me</b>, the explanation of which is, about me; like someone who doubts if I truly gave birth from Avraham. 

Verse 7

<b>And she said:</b> She explained that she understood that it was like this, even though no one was so brazen as to laugh in front of her. Nevertheless, she understood; as, behold, <b>who would have declared to Avraham</b> - in the way of those who give blessings - that he should father more children? And she did not hear anyone that came to the celebration saying to Avraham, "will Sarah nurse children" - meaning that she should give birth again. Rather [they came] because they could not believe it. And she explained the reason that they did not believe it: 
<b>Since I have borne him a son in his old age</b> - and not in my old age, but in his old age - because of this, they are in doubt and laughing to themselves about this. 

Verse 8

<b>And Avraham made a great banquet:</b> [He did this] in order to show everyone that the newborn was precious to him, given that he was his son. However...

Verse 9

<b>But Sarah saw, etc. laughing:</b> [Yishmael] was  still planting a doubt [about Yitzchak's paternity]. He was saying that there is no proof from this, as Avraham was doing it for the benefit of his wife, who was very beloved to him. Hence the things struck her heart.

Verse 10

<b>Drive out this maidservant and her son:</b> And through this, everyone will know that Yitzchak is your son. As behold, a man as great as Avraham would not drive out his only son out of love for his wife. And do not say that it is not proper to distance Yishmael - as the transferal of the legacy and the inheritance will be included in this; all the more so, the rights of the first born. Hence she said...
<b>for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit:</b> He should not inherit even without this. As a result, it is appropriate that you should publicize this in your lifetime. 
<b>With my son, with Yitzchak:</b> The exactitude of this expression will still be explained below.

Verse 11

<b>On account of his son:</b> As Sarah had said (Genesis 21:10), "and her son" - implying that she wanted Avraham to act towards Yishmael like towards the son of a maidservant, since her offspring is like (has the same status as) her and does not go after the father. But he knew it was not so. As behold, he had freed her and taken her as a wife. And it is like it is written above (Genesis 16:15), "and [Avram] called the name of his son."

Verse 12

<b>Concerning the youth and concerning your maidservant:</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, did not say, "concerning the maidservant and concerning her son" - as he is certainly his son. But the verdict was nevertheless with Sarah.
<b>Listen to (<i>be</i>, literally, in) her voice:</b> And He did not say, "listen to (<i>le</i>) her voice" - the implication of which [would be] that he should do like she said, like the language of Scripture above (Genesis 16:2), "And [Avram] listened to the voice of Sarai, his wife." But the implication of, "in her voice," is that he be precise and contemplate her words. And see what I have written on the Book of Deuteronomy 30:2, proving this intention.  
<b>For it is through Yitzchak that your seed will be called:</b> Relative to Yitzchak, he is certainly not considered a son, as only he will be called your seed. 

Verse 13

<b>But also the son of the maidservant, etc. for he is your seed:</b> On his own, he is certainly your seed. And, if so, Sarah was right concerning the inheritance that was relevant to Yitzchak. But regarding Yishmael on his own - in that which does not relate to Yitzchak your son - he is certainly your seed. And see what I have written above on Genesis 16:6. And that is the exactitude of Sarah's expression, "with my son, with Yitzchak" (Genesis 21:10). But had Sarah's intention been to say that Yishmael not be considered a son to Avraham, but rather a son of the maidservant - if so, Yishmael would not inherit even if Yitzchak had not been born at all. Rather she certainly conceded that Yishmael was considered a son. But he was not considered a son, 'with her son, with Yitzchak,' because that was the stipulation - that regarding Sarah, Hagar would be like a maidservant, and as I wrote there.   

Verse 14

<b>And a skin of water:</b> Our father Avraham estimated that there would be enough for the journey to arrive at another inhabited place; but <b> she went and strayed</b>. And as a result, the water came to an end. And thus did the Rashbam explain.

Verse 15

<b>Under one of the bushes:</b> To protect against the burning sun and it adding to [his] thirst. 

Verse 16

<b>And she went to sit across from him:</b> A second time, to indicate that she distanced herself more than a bowshot, since she wanted to cry out loud. But she did not want the child to hear her crying; as this is hard for a sick person - whether he will recover or whether he will die. Hence she distanced herself further <b>and she raised her voice and cried</b>.

Verse 17

<b>There where he is:</b> Also before he drank and he was in danger from thirst, God heard. So He brought him out of his sickness.

Verse 18

<b>And grasp him with your hand:</b> She would not need to carry him much at all, but he would rather walk with his feet; but you should still grasp him with your hand. And included in [this phrase] is that he would be strengthened from her until she would be strengthened from him. And He further stated about this, <b>for a great nation, etc.</b>. 

Verse 19

<b>And He opened:</b> For even though He healed the child from the sickness of thirst, would he not nevertheless need to drink regularly?

Verse 20

<b>And he became an archer, a bowman (<i>kashat</i>):</b> The vocalization of <i>kashat</i> teaches us that it is not the name of a tool that he shoots (<i>keshet</i>, being a bow). Rather it is a verbal noun. It is a craftsman, like a <i>gamal</i> [and] a <i>chamar</i>, the meaning of which is a driver of camels (<i>gamalim</i>) [and] a driver of donkeys (<i>chamorim)</i>. As Yishmael was a craftsmen with this like someone accustomed and trained, even though he did not have anyone who taught him. Rather it was with the help of the Heavens.

Verse 25

<b>Avimelech’s servants.</b> His ministers and officials. <b>Had taken by force.</b> Avraham was concerned not about the injustice done to him but about the lack of fear of Heaven on the part of Avimelech’s men and presumably Avimelech himself.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

<b>And after these events:</b> It is clear that this section has a relationship to the section before it. As otherwise, the expression, "after these events," is not fitting. Though the manner of the relationship is explained in Rashi's commentary according to the aggadah in Sanhedrin (89) - if it is so, they are distant in time from one another, according to the tradition that Yitzchak was thirty-seven at the time of the binding. And there are some that explain that it is a punishment for the covenant he made with Avimelekh. But this is also not proximate in time - for behold that the matter of the covenant was at that [same] time, of Yitzchak and the expulsion of Yishmael. In truth, there is an argument in the Midrash if, "after (<i>achar</i>)" is proximate, and "following (<i>achrei</i>)" is remote, or the opposite. However it appears that the explanation of, "after these events" [here], is after all the utterances and statements that there were between the Holy One, blessed be He, and Avraham. And He had raised him - little by little - higher and higher: From the beginning of His blessing him with the Land of Israel and with seed like the dust of the earth; and afterwards with the increase of children like the stars of the sky - meaning people of great worth - and afterwards, He blessed him at the time of the circumcision that the would be a father to many nations. That is that he would have the ability to have even the nations of the world - who would be called by the name, nations, and would not completely convert - recognize the God of the world. However there was still a particular that was missing, as will be explained. And the matter of the binding was after all of these things. For with this, the greatness of Avraham, our father, and his seed was completed, such that nothing more was needed. So from then on, the Holy One, blessed be He, did not speak with him; and there was no more content and addition to the goal that had been desired. And because of that. it is written, "<b>and God tested (<i>nissa</i>) Avraham</b>." As even though the text does not depart from its straightforward understanding, which is the matter of a test - according to its straightforward understanding alone, it is superfluous. As we surely see that it is a test. And this is even though we should not ask why God, who knows everything from the beginning, needs a test - as it is a question of [divine] knowledge and [human] choice, which is loftier than human knowledge. So we should [just] know that the ways of God are above our ways, as are His thoughts [above] our thoughts. However there is another meaning to this, as it is found in Rabbah (Bereishit Rabbah 55:1) on this: <i>Nissa</i> is from the usage, "You have given a banner (<i>nes</i>) to those who fear You, that it may be displayed (<i>lehitnosess</i>)" (Psalms 60:6) - meaning He raised him upon a banner. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, explained that with this test, He extended the power of Avraham, our father, and raised him to the purpose of the Israelite nation, as will be explained. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, in Rabbah there, have already drawn a metaphor about the content of the test with three analogies: 1) To a good jug that a buyer knocks, as opposed to a bad one. 2) To good flax that he hits much; so that the more he hits it, the more it improves, as opposed to bad flax. 3) He adds much to the load of a good donkey, and examines it [to determine whether] it can carry more. And the matter of the three analogies is to teach us that a test comes for three aspects. On one occasion, it comes like the analogy of the good jug, about which the knocking is not in order to improve it, but rather to know how strong the jug is. And on [another] occasion, it comes like the analogy of the flax, about which the knocking does not come in order to know [its] strength, but rather to improve [it]. And on [a third] occasion, it comes like the analogy of a donkey, about which it does not come in order to know [it] or in order to improve [it]; rather when its owner has a large load, he is testing his donkey [whether] it can carry more, which will be good for him. And the owner will add to its nourishment afterwards according to the additional load that his donkey carries. Likewise on one occasion, a test comes to know the power of a person's righteousness, and that is considered an examination. On [another] occasion, a test comes in order to add to his righteousness. As even though this action rests in a person's potential, so long as the action has not come to him and he has not actualized the potential, this potential has nevertheless not become rooted within him. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, brings him to this test; and he [then] strengthens himself to actualize his potential and roots this potential inside himself. And on [a third] occasion, a test will come for the iniquity of the generation. So He will place them - a load of afflictions - upon the righteous one, and he will receive his full reward afterwards. From here, the midrash on this section teaches us that we should not think that this test came about only like the first analogy of the jug, as an examination. For if so, Avraham, our father, did not become elevated with this. It is not so. Rather the Holy One, blessed be He, raised the power of our father Avraham's holy being with this action. And that is the meaning of, "[God] <i>nisa</i> Avraham, from the usage, "You have given a banner (<i>nes</i>) to those who fear You, that it may be displayed (<i>lehitnosess</i>)." And with that which this potential was rooted into Avraham's being, this action remained rooted in the Israelite nation for [all] generations - as will be further explained on verse 17 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 22:17). And see Exodus 16:4 and Deuteronomy 8:2 and 9:7. Furthermore, it should be explained that which, "test," is not also written about Yitzchak - as behold, he was already thirty-seven years old! However it shall be explained below that the purpose of this act upon Yitzchak was on account of the settlement of Israel upon their land, [such that] their bread was fixed by way of the daily sacrifices. So it was particularly fit that it would be so through Yitzchak, since this principle came out to the world with his birth, as I wrote earlier [on] 21:3 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 21:3). So it was not for the purpose of a test; and it was then like the other tests through which Avraham was tested, and about which it was [also] not written that it was a test. However, that which the Holy One, blessed be He, hid the intent from Avraham, our father - that was only in order to be a test. 
<b>Avraham; and he said, "Here I am":</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, did not say at once, "Avraham, please take [etc.]." Rather He waited for him, until Avraham's mind became settled and he understood that the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to speak to him [about] a great thing; and he answered, "Here I am." And this was so that he would not be [too] confused to hear, and [then] answer something improper, God forbid. Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, waited until his mind became settled.

Verse 2

<b>And you, go (<i>lekh lekha</i>):</b> We have already explained at the beginning of Parashat Lekh [Lekha] (Haamek Davar on Genesis 12:1) that the expression, "<i>lekh lekha</i>" here, is that no person should know about this except for you. [This was] so that hindrances to this wonderous thing not increase. And so did Avraham, our father, do. For he did not inform anyone [about it] - even to his lads with whom he walked, [he said nothing] until he said to them, "we will prostrate ourselves and we will return" (Genesis 22:5).  
 <b>Sacrifice him as a burnt-offering:</b> See what I wrote later on verse 9 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 22:9) in explanation of the word, "there," as it appears to be superfluous.
<b>Which I will tell you:</b> He [never] told [him] explicitly. Rather that which he saw and understood to be the mountain, by way of the sighting of a cloud and the glory of God, that was an utterance of God. And so will it be explained later, 24:51 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 24:51), and in many places. 

Verse 3

<b>And [Avraham] awoke early in the morning:</b> That is right after the breaking of the dawn. And see what I wrote on the book of Exodus 34:4 (Haamek Davar on Exodus 34:4). 
<b>His two lads with him (<i>ito</i>):</b> Here, it is written, "<i>ito</i>," whereas with Bilaam, it is written, "<i>imo</i>" (another way of saying, with him); and likewise in the book of I Samuel 28:8. The difference between <i>ito</i> and <i>imo</i> is explained (Haamek Davar on Numbers 5:4): That <i>imo</i> implies more equality and friendliness together than the expression, <i>ito</i>. And that is why this difference comes up - as Avraham did not become friendly with his lads then, like Bilaam and  [did].
<b>And he split the wood of the burnt-offering:</b> After he took them outside of the city, he then split the wood of the burnt-offering. And he did this so that Sarah would not notice. As it is certain that he told her that he was going and taking Yitzchak for [some] elevated purpose, but he did not reveal the matter. And it is already known that he told her that he was taking him to the study hall of Shem and Ever. And so he did at the end - as will be explained on verse 19 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 22:19). Consequently, he needed to hide the work of splitting the wood.
<b>The wood of the burnt-offering:</b> That which is fit for a burnt-offering. It is as we learned in Middot, Chapter 2 (Middot 2:5), "Any wood that has a worm in it is disqualified from being on the altar." And there are several other laws about this - and it is known that Avraham, our father, studied Torah. And see also what is proximate.
<b>And he rose and went:</b> Up until here, he went from his home slowly, without alacrity. As behold, he still had to choose the wood and to prepare. After this, it is written, "and he rose" - with alacrity.  
<b>To the place:</b> If the intent is the Land of Moriah in general, it needs [to write], "to the Land." Rather the intent is the mountain. However this is ostensibly difficult, as he surely did not yet know [which] mountain. Rather the intent of the verse is that, from the Heavens, he chanced to go in the direction that one goes to approach that place. For behold, one who goes from one land to another land has several paths. But the one going [usually] knows which path is close to the specific place in that land to which he is going. However this was not the case with Avraham. He did not know the specific place [to which he was going]. And if so, he did not know upon which path to go; but he chose a path nevertheless. And his steps were guided from the Heavens to the place that [God] told him.

Verse 4

<b>And Avraham raised his eyes:</b> Why [there was a need for] this raising of the eyes is unclear. If it was in order to see the place, is it not that it was not a sensory sight but rather a spiritual sight? So when the will of the Omnipresent, may He be blessed, would arrive at showing him, he would see even without raising the eyes. Rather the explanation is that he lifted his eyes to the Omnipresent (<i>Makom</i>, the word used in this verse to mean, the place he wished to see). For the journey irritated him greatly, and he would have absolutely preferred to finish this deed, and not to endure the test [so] long. And it was also because he needed to conceal the matter from the lads, such that it would not also become difficult in their eyes - 'where is the lamb?' Hence he asked from God that he should see. And so is it in Rabbah (Bereishit Rabbah 56:1), that he was saved from this on the third day, like many righteous people that were saved from their distress on the third day.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>And he said, "Father":</b> And he did not immediately ask, "Where is the lamb." As he sensed something wonderous, but he did not find the heart to ask until after reflecting upon the answer of his father - whether it would be with a pleasant countenance and love. Therefore when he answered him, "Here I am, my son" - which was a loving answer - he then asked to know.

Verse 8

<b>God will see to the lamb for Him (<i>lo</i>):</b> This, "for Him," is superfluous. However no sacrifice can be given in the name of God (<i>Elohim</i>), but rather only in the name of the Lord, as it is found at the end of Menachot. And [the reason] that it is written with the name of God in this section is because the daily burnt-offerings were fixed through this deed, as I wrote on the proximate verse (Haamek Davar on Genesis 22:9). And this is the nature of sustenance in the Land of Israel from when nature was created, as I wrote above 15:7 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 15:7). For this reason the statement was with the name, God (which relates to nature) - as I have written several times. But the essence of the deed is for the name, Lord. And this is the understanding of, "God will see to the lamb for Him" - for the Lord.

Verse 9

<b>And he arranged the wood, and he bound, etc.:</b> All of this story is coming to teach us that Avraham, our father, understood from the words of God that he should proceed with this according to the law of a set sacrifice on the Temple altar. For behold Avraham, our father, learned all of the entire Torah, as it is taught at the end of Kiddushin (62a). So he knew the difference between a communal sacrifice in the Temple and a sacrifice on a private altar. And all of the laws of a daily offering, and the commandment of arrangement of the wood, are only with the daily offering - the essence of which is upon the altar in the Temple. So Avraham, our father, understood [this] from God saying to him, "on one of the mountains, etc." (Genesis 22:2). [As] if it were for a private sacrifice, what is this place to me [more than] another place? Rather it is the mountain designated for the building of the Choice House. For that reason, he fulfilled the laws of the daily offerings with this [sacrifice of Yitzchak]. And see verse 18 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 22:18). And even though we do not place [them] up on the altar alive - that is because the skin of an animal is not sacrificed, which is not the case with human skin, as it is true flesh. For that reason it is better to place him up alive.
<b>From above (<i>mimeaal</i>) the wood:</b> It needs [to write], "on the wood (<i>meaal</i>)," like in the book of Leviticus 1. However the understanding of on the wood would have been literally on [it], and not above that which is above, as I wrote earlier 1:7 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 1:7). But the meaning of, from above, is certainly above that which is above. For that reason, it is written, "from above (<i>mimeaal</i>)" - to teach us that he brought him up as a burnt-offering from above. Meaning that the soul of Yitzchak flew up and Michael (the angel) sacrificed it on the supernal altar, as Tosafot wrote at the end of Menachot (110a). And through this, the word of God was fulfilled literally, and nothing was lacking except for the slaughter of Yitzchak's body. And the ram came for this in his place, so his soul was returned to its place. It comes out that the matter is explicitly hinted to in Scripture for those who carefully observe the specifics of the language. And that which God said (Genesis 22:2), "sacrifice him there as a burnt-offering," is also exact: As what was Scripture missing [had it just stated], "sacrifice him as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains, etc.?" Rather it was hinting to him that this raising up would be there, at the place that was known to the Holy One, blessed be He. And that would be "on one of the mountains, etc." - since the altar above is precisely corresponding to the altar that is on the mountain. 

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>Avraham, Avraham:</b> Since Avraham was immersed in the enthusiasm of the deed [and, so,] almost devoid of his physical senses, it was hence necessary to stop him with an alarming voice before he would turn back to listen.

Verse 12

<b>Nor do anything to him:</b> It is like the explanation of Rashi, that he should not even make an impression of blood like the matter of the blood of circumcision: For even if [a child] is not relevant to this commandment - such as if he is born circumcised - it is nevertheless a commandment to  draw a drop of covenantal blood. But here He warned him also against this.
<b>That you fear God:</b> This statement is wonderous! And was it not already known, even to everyone, that Avraham feared God in the most expansive way possible? And just the opposite - there was no great proof from this deed alone that Avraham always feared God, since it was in His hands to kill [him] even without Avraham's sacrifice! As behold, if a king of flesh and blood decrees upon a man to slaughter his son, it is impossible to resist it. For he knows that it is in the hands of the king to kill both of them, the father and the son. Rather the matter of the test is in two things: The first is that if a king commanded a simple person that has no acquaintance or business with the king to slaughter his son, it is obvious that he has nothing to do besides to go and fulfill the word of the king. But if [the king] says to his friend who is frequently with him to do this wonderous thing, it is obvious that he would not restrain himself from asking the king why and how; and maybe he would change his mind. So too was it possible with Avraham. As he was the friend of the Holy One, blessed be He, and he found the courage to request much concerning Sodom. But behold, when a decree like this about his son, who was like his own soul, came before him, he did not say a thing and went and did [it] without any question or hesitation. And this is as if he were not a particular friend, but rather with the fear of God like any person. So he did not say anything about that which related to himself. And this is a wonderous novelty, and see what I wrote on the book of Deuteronomy 4:10 (Haamek Davar on Deuteronomy 4:10).
<b>And you have not withheld, etc. from Me:</b> And this is the second novelty: 
And it is the reason for, "nor do anything to him." For if the Holy One, blessed be He, had commanded him to slaughter and kill his son, he would have been obligated to do it whether he wanted to or not. But with God's command to bring him up as a burnt-offering - given that a burnt-offering is only willing, as it is written, "according to your will" - if so, if it had been from compulsion, Yitzchak would not have been sanctified as a burnt-offering. So he would have been permitted afterwards to inflict a blemish upon him. But since Avraham did it with love, with complete will to the point that Yitzchak was sanctified as a burnt-offering; if so, he did not withhold him from Him. And because of that, He warned him not to inflict a blemish upon him.

Verse 13

<b>And behold, a ram after it had been caught:</b> The word, after, has no meaning [here]. And Rashi explained, [it means] after the words [of the angel]. And likewise did Onkelos translate [it]. But if so, "after," should have been written before, "and behold, a ram." Rather it is referring to, "had been caught," such that it was not caught in the thicket at first, but rather Avraham saw in front of his eyes that it got caught in the thicket. And the reason according to the straightforward meaning is that he would have had to have been concerned lest one of the passers-by stuck him there until he would return. But this would not be the case when he sees a ram walking wildly - it would be obvious that it is ownerless. But if so, it would be difficult to take it. Hence it was caught in the thicket in front of his eyes and he went and got it. 

Verse 14

<b>The Lord will see:</b> From this place He shall see, to oversee His world. For behold, here is the place of His Kingship, may He be blessed - as it is found in Rosh Hashanah (27a) [Chapter] 3, that we blast trumpets and a horn in the Temple, because it is stated (Psalms 98:6), "With trumpets and the blast of the horn, raise a shout before the Lord, the King." 
<b>As it is said this day:</b> After the giving of the Torah, when they were commanded to build the Temple there, such that there would be appearance of the face in the courtyard.
<b>On the mountain of the Lord, He will be seen (<i>yiraeh</i>):</b> <i>Yireh</i> (will see) [can also be a reading of] <i>yiraeh</i>, as is known - the beginning of Tractate Chagigah (2a).

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>And did not withhold your only son:</b> Here it did not specify, "from Me," like in the first statement (Genesis 22:12). Rather it is like its literal meaning - that he gave over the soul of his son for the glory and the will of the Holy One, blessed be He.

Verse 17

<b>And I will surely multiply:</b> The intent is not quantitative multiplication. For behold he was already blessed with [being] like the dust of the earth (Genesis 12:16). Rather this multiplication is largeness of the soul, like above 17:2. So here the seed of Avraham was blessed with the commandment of the sanctification of [God's] name - as it is found in Sanhedrin [in the] chapter [entitled] Ben Sorer ouMoreh, that Israel is commanded about the sanctification of [God's] name, but the nations of the world are not. And it is understood that this only glorifies Israel. For behold, a civilized person will not request from his fellow to cut off his hand for the sake of his [own] life. But that is not the case from his son, whom he loves like his [own] soul, and whom he knows about himself that he would do the same for the sake of his son's life. It is [hence] no wonder that it is likewise fitting that the son should do so for the sake of his father. It comes out that this desire shows [their] soulful love, since they are both like one body, and [that] he would give everything he has for his life. And so did the Holy One, blessed be He, command His children - who are His portion, may He be blessed and the bearers of His Kingship - to give over their lives on account of His name and His glory, which is, as it were, His life. It is as it is written (Numbers 14:21), "However, just as I live and the Glory of the Lord fills the entire land," and as I have written in explantion of that verse there (Haamek Davar on Numbers 14:21) and in several places. [But] this is not the case with the nations of the world, as they are removed from Him, may He be blessed. And Avraham merited this deed so that his children would attain largeness of the soul to willingly give themselves over on account of the sanctification of [God's] name, may He be blessed. And God said that this multiplication would be in two aspects: The first is <b>as the stars of the sky</b> - these are the greats in knowledge, who shine in their generations like the stars of the sky. And they also give merit to the masses, in that which they give themselves over and are killed for  the sanctification of [God's] name. And the second is <b>and like the sand on the seashore</b> - these are the masses of the people. When they come to the sanctification of [God's] name, they give themselves over with a good heart. And this is such that the idolaters are compared to the seas, as it is written in the book of Isaiah (17:12), "they roar like the raging seas." And it is written in the Song of Songs (8:7), "Great waters will not quench the love," which is referring to the idolaters. And the waves of the sea futilely appear as if they are flooding the sand around it. And in fact, [the sea] sometimes floods over many grains of sand surrounding it without number. Yet they are nevertheless broken on account of the sand. Likewise are the nations of the world not able to flood the largeness of their souls and their inner strength. And see Bava Batra 8 (7b) - as they explained the statement of David, "I count them; they exceed the sand" (Psalms 139:18), like this: "Just like the sand [...] protects from the sea [etc.]."
<b>And your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies:</b> In many places, the gate is the meeting place of sages and the greats of the province. So he was blessed that, in the end, it will occur that Israel will sit at the gates of the nations that pursued them in hatred.

Verse 18

<b>And through your seed will be blessed, etc.:</b> This is a blessing in of itself - that they should find grace and kindness in the eyes of the nations of the world to the point that they be blessed by them. 
<b>Because you have listened to My voice:</b> This blessing is not because he did not withhold his son, but rather because he understood the voice of God. And he learned from His words that His will was to have a fixed sacrifice, like the law of communal altars - as I wrote above, [verse] 9 (Haamek Davar on Genesis 22:9). Hence his children merited that a thread of grace would be extended over them [when giving these sacrifices], like the principle of the one who occupies himself with Torah. As it is found in Avodah Zarah 3b, "Anyone who occupies himself with Torah at night, a thread of kindness, etc." And we have already explained several times that the meaning of listening to the voice, is understanding and precise inference about [the speaker's] words. And see Deuteronomy 30:2, as we learned from there that it is necessary to explain it that way. And also see verse 20 there.

Verse 19

<b>And Avraham returned:</b> But it is not written, Yitzchak (returned with him). Onkelos already translated that he brought him to the study hall of Shem to study Torah. And it is reasonable to say that when God finished [saying], "because you listened to My voice," he contemplated that this was the will of God - to occupy oneself with words of Torah. And even though Avraham studied with him, it is better that there be two places regarding contemplation about words of Torah, as it is found in Avodah Zarah 19a.

Verse 1



Verse 2

The verse begins by explaining three aspect of Eliezer's capability, as a result of which he was ideal for this mission. This is because the thing that was being sought after and worked for could be completed and come to light through one of three possibilities: sometimes by soft language and persuasion, sometimes by intelligence and expansive speech, and sometimes by perceptiveness and a firm response. And all is according to the matter and the person who comes to speak with him. And indeed it is known that the natures of all people are not alike. There are people who are fit to complete a matter in one particular way, and those who are the opposite. And here, Abraham did not know how it would be sought out to accomplish the matter. Therefore he chose this servant, who had all capabilities, because he was his servant and humble before his master with gentle responses.

2. "And your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies (those who hate them)." This is a bracha that they (the descendants) will be wise men, seated at the gate (ie, a place of public prominence). Even in the gates of their enemies (those who hate them [Hebrew root Sin-Nun-Aleph]) there will be people who seek out their wisdom and advice. Earlier on in the story of the Akeida (the Binding of Isaac) there was a similar blessing "ויירש זרעך את שער אויביו" "and your descendants will inherit the gates of their enemies (those who would seek to do them harm [Hebrew root Aleph-Vav-Yud-Bet])." See Bereishit 22:17, and see Haamek Davar ad loc. In that case, the Holy One Blessed Be He who knows the thoughts [of the "enemies"] described them with the root Aleph-Vav-Yud-Bet [rather than Sin-Nun-Aleph] which describes a feeling in their hearts. But a hater enemy [Sin-Nun-Aleph] implies action as well, as in Devarim 30:7 "upon your enemies [root Sin-Nun-Aleph] who chase after you." And people do not appreciate the wonder this is that even those who actively hate us will need the wisdom of Israel.

And it is appropriate to know that, although Yaakov performed intensive actions, nevertheless without Hashgacha Pratis (Specific Divine Providence) it would have been impossible for the technique to be so effective. Rather, the main (effect was caused by) Hashgacha (Providence) combined with an action- as in a hidden miracle. (This is just) like a curse at an inopportune time (Heaven forfend). The Midrash states in Eicha Rabba that (when) one hits with a stick between the 17th of Tammuz and the 9th of Av, a destroying angel hits with an iron stick and kills (the victim). So too with blessing, a small action on the part of a person causes a great impact (from) above. The actions of our fathers are a sign for the children in their exile amongst many nations, that their success is based on diligence and knowledge and preparation, and the assistance of Heaven completes them.

<b>And of all the truth:</b> Onkelos translates it as, "and from all the good," which is not like his translation in every [other] place, which is "truth." And see Ramban, who explains that lasting kindnesses are called truth. And such is [also] the language of Scripture: "And the Lord is a true God, a living God and the eternal King" (Jeremiah 10:10). And in Vayikra Rabbah 26:1 (Parshat Emor), it explains that the end of the verse explains what is  a true God: "Because He is 'a [living] God and the eternal King.'" [That is] to say, because He is everlasting. And [this is] like the remark in the Talmud (Shabbat 104a), "Truth is lasting." And so too is the good that is everlasting called truth. And so [Ya'akov said] that "You have done two goodnesses for me" - meaning "the kindnesses," which are the wealth; and "all the truth," which is that He chose him, such that a chosen nation will come from him and his offspring, to be everlasting. And it is for this very reason that Onkelos translated it as, "and of all the good."

Verse 12

Mother together with children - if we are going to explain that he was worried that he [Esav] would attack mothers along with children, as it is said at the end of his prayer "and You said, etc and I set your seed etc" it is difficult to do so, given that God said to Avram, after Lot separated from him "and you seed will be like the dust of the earth, that is a person can count etc", since what would the "like the sand of the sea", an expression also present in the blessing, add? And more, what proof is there that he [Esav] wouldn't kill some of the children but the blessing could still happen on the rest of them? Rather, he was not worried about the children, since the children are "like him", exactly. He only worried about the wives, because they would protect them so that he [Esav] would not harm them, like the way of the mothers, and he was worried that he would kill the mothers in front of the children, and since "his wife is like his body" he said "strike me down." And this is also true given that he was warned not to take new wives, even after their deaths [of Rachel and Leah] since Lavan said "more children after theirs" since he was worried that their inheritance would be diminished due to children of another wife, and this is why he made a pact not to take other wives over his daughters, even after their deaths. And the proof to this is that the mitzvah of [not taking for wives] "a woman and her sister" applies only "during her lifetime" (Leviticus 18:1), and so obviously Lavan meant even after their deaths.

Verse 16

<b>On that day Eisov returned.</b> He was perturbed by Yaakov’s attitude towards him and did not part from him with a kiss as Lavan had done. For this reason Yaakov refrained from visiting him in Seir as he had said he would do.

Chapter 34



Verse 1

<b>Deenah went out.</b> Since Yaakov lived outside of town the verse should have said that she “came in.” However, Scripture wanted to hint that she “went out” of the guidelines of proper behavior by going to watch the locals dance and make merry.

Verse 2



<b>And mistreated her.</b> Elsewhere this word implies deprivation from relations (see Rashi 31:50). She believed that after this no Israelite would want to marry her, but in the end her brother Shimon married her.

My brothers. And from where would he know who he [Joseph] was and who his brothers were? And furthermore, what is this question "tell me please where they are pasturing"? From where would he know? Rather, [it must be] one of the two these possibilities: Either he was a well-known man to them in his importance, or, he recognized him as an angel or prophet that knew everything to do with his brothers. And in truth, the Torah should have said "and he [Joseph] found a man", for it was Joseph that was wandering alone searching and found the man, not the man who was walking on his way. Rather, the text comes to teach that the man was a messenger from Heaven, to encounter Joseph and bring him to such, and the man went and found him in that place.

That were going through the desert with that caravan of Ishmaelites and the camels, because it is impossible to go through the desert without a large caravan, and they (the Midianites) were going on foot. And what it mentions was not "seen from a distance" except the tall camels. And the Midianites that went on foot turned from the road for the sound of Yosef, or because their hearts pushed them to look into that pit.
The Midianites. And the brothers who saw it rejoiced in this, because their desire was done without their getting involved. And if Yehuda had not spoken so, they would not have set on pulling him out and selling him, but they would have left him in the pit until he died. But when it had been decided by them to do so, it was a delight to them that it was done by the Midianites. And this is what it says in Bereishis Rabbah 84 that Yosef was stolen twice. His brothers stole him from their father, and the Midianites from the brothers. And in any case, Yosef said when he made himself known to his brothers "because you sold me here". Because they caused the matter, and they knew the action of the Midianites and it wasn't stopped by them. This is as if they did it. And so Rashbam interprets....
The Ishmaelites.

I have told my sorcerers, but nobody can explain it to me - All this seems unnecessary [ed. that he has told his sorcerers]. [It also seems unnecessary] that he as already said nobody could explain it. Furthermore, we must investigate why the Sages (חכמים) aren't mentioned, because it says (Genesis 41:8) that he also sent for the Sages. Rather, this is simply referring to the question that Pharaoh asks Joseph. Joseph was wondering why Pharaoh hadn't consulted with his sorcerers, and Pharaoh responds that he had but they couldn't answer him. And from there, there's no cause to wonder about [why] the Sages (חכמים) [were not mentioned] because their wisdom wasn't sufficient enough to understand the deep details of such a dream. But the sorcerers who made magic needed such details in order to interpret the dream, and if so, it is obvious that [he didn't need to mention the Sages]. [summary - the Sages and the sorcerers needed each other to properly interpret the dream, and thus the fact that one of them couldn't do anything logically implies the other couldn't as well].

After this they could not speak to him face to face. But he showed them by kissing them and crying as one brother does over another.  They understood that he interpreted his dreams as having already been fulfilled and that he no longer believed he was their master, God Forbid.  And now they spoke to him.

Verse 14


He guided his hands for Menashe was the firstborn. It is extra for we known from the parsha that Menashe was the firstborn. But this has depth and intension for truthfully, Yaakov shouldn't have guided (crossed) his hands, rather switched the positions of the boys. But since Menashe was the firstborn, he intended that Menashe should stand by Yaakov's right leg and Efrayim by his left leg. Only his hands did he guide that they should be crossed. The reason is that even though Yaakov put Efrayim before Menashe and therefore in the wilderness he was the head of his flag group (which Menashe was also a part of) still, in the counting of Parshas Pinchas, it was the opposite. Not only that, but even in the counting of Parshas Bamidbar it is written by all the (other) flags "and those that camp upon him" as opposed to with Menashe it is written, "and upon him the tribe of Menashe." All this comes to teach us that Efrayim only came before Menashe in matters of spirituality, that which is higher than the natural happenings of the world. In matters of the world, however, Menashe came before Efrayim. Therefore in the first counting at Mt. Chorev, where the Divine precence was upon their heads and the conduct was beyond nature, Efrayim came first. But in the counting in the Plains of Moav, when they were entering the Land, which was basically in a natural way (as is explained later in Bamidbar and Devarim) therefore Menashe came first. (And check out what I write in Bamidbar regarding the change of "and upon him the tribe of Menashe." The occurred because with regards to natural occurrences, the advantage of the firstborn is very impactful as I wrote earlier (27:19). Now, the hand services the head and the mind and the foot services the goings of the body according to its nature. That's why the Sages said in their way: The son is the foot of the father. Meaning: the natural mannerisms of the father that goes on its own without thought and wisdom. Therefore, Jacob desired that Menashe stand by his right leg and guided his hands so that Efrayim would be on his right hand. See more in Verse 20. That is why the verse specified "because Menashe was the firstborn."

"Yet his bow stayed taut" ... As much as a bow is powerfully bent, it is able to shoot further, so too the bow of Joseph was straining to shoot an evil reward to his brothers. However, 
"and his arms were made firm" - he showed the beauty of his hands to do good to them by giving them plenty and wealth...  The next verse explains that Joseph gained these characteristics because they came...
"From the hands of the mighty Yaakov" ~ according to the simple meaning, his father Yaakov had huge strength in terms of his ability to create peace, as has been explained previously... Yosef receives this from his father... However, others have claimed that the expression אביר יעקב actually is a name for the Holy One of Blessing as we find in other places.... and making an oath by Avr Yaakov can be explained by the verse in Devarim 32:9 "Yaakov His allotment" (allotment = chevel = rope) we explained there that the Jewish people are compared to a rope which is twisted together from many strands, and at the top it is thick and at the bottom, it is separated into different strands.  So too the Holy One of Blessing is the ultimate soul of all souls which comprise the Jewish people, as we find in Sanhedrin 64a: "if a Jewish person is suffering, what does the Shechinah say? My head hurts, etc.". If a thread is pulled at the bottom of the rope, the top of the thick rope feels it as well. This is the great strength of Joseph.  It is because of this that it is forbidden to take revenge against one another, as it is written in Vayikra 19:18, and this is the reason of Yosef.
