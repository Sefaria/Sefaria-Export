Verse 5


<b>Nine hundred.</b> Sometimes the hundreds are written first and sometimes the units. In general when the units are written last it indicates that the person’s last few years were just as fruitful as the rest of his life and when they are written first it indicates that his final years were unproductive. There are exceptions to this rule, however; see Rashi 23:1.

Verse 6

<b>That He had made man.</b> Note that it does not say that He repented that He <i>created</i> man, but only that He <i>made</i> him — i.e. that He allowed him to become so numerous. Hashem knew from the start that a creature made of earth could only be brought to perfection after much tending and pruning.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>I will establish My covenant.</b> This refers to the blessing that Hashem gave Adam and Chavah. Its consequence here was that Noach and his family would remain alive.

Chapter 7



Verse 1



<b>And your household.</b> Noach was permitted to take with him his servants and animals, not to contribute to the repopulating of the earth but to help him in his labors. Note that until this point the name <i>Elokim</i> has been used, indicating strict judgment, whereas in this verse the four-letter Name indicating the attribute of mercy appears.

<b>From these the whole world developed.</b> Hashem intended humankind to be comprised of three categories: 1) simple workers, 2) refined intellectuals and 3) people of God who would serve as His “throne” on earth.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22


<b>And told it (<i>vayageid</i>) to his brothers.</b> <i>Vayageid</i> signifies regaling the listener with a story rather than reporting it dryly. Thus Cham’s Canaan-like behavior consisted in the <i>way</i> he relayed the information and not only in the fact that he did so.

<b>You must preserve My covenant.</b> The earlier covenant embodied in the sacrifices (15:7-18) would not have distinguished the Jewish nation in exile as circumcision would.

<b>Keep your hand strong on him.</b> From this point on she no longer needed to carry him but only to support him with her arm.

Verse 23

<b>With my son (<i>nin</i>).</b> <i>Nin</i> signifies a royal heir. Avimelech’s primary concern was the safety of his kingdom.


<b>Do to me.</b> When you inherit the land do not drive us out, but treat us with amity, just as we treated you.

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>Avimelech’s servants.</b> His ministers and officials. <b>Had taken by force.</b> Avraham was concerned not about the injustice done to him but about the lack of fear of Heaven on the part of Avimelech’s men and presumably Avimelech himself. How could he propose swearing in Hashem’s Name if he had no fear of Him?

<b>His sons Yitzchok and Yishmael.</b> Avraham informed Yishmael of Hashem’s decree that although he was his son in all other ways, with respect to Yitzchok it was as if he was a stranger. From the fact that he accepted this bitter message the Sages derived that he was a true penitent.

Verse 34

<b>The daughter of Be’eri the Chittite.</b> From the fact that Yitzchok did not warn him against marrying a Canaanite it is clear that he knew that Yaakov alone was to be his heir (see Rashi 28:15). Nevertheless, he loved Eisov because he thought him resourceful and decent.

<b>Have you not saved a blessing for me.</b> Eisov understood that he could not receive the same blessing that his brother had received, but he was hoping for a similar one.

Chapter 28



Verse 1

<b>Yitzchok called.</b> Yaakov was embarrassed to come to Yitzchok on his own after having deceived him. By calling him Yitzchok conferred his retroactive approval of Yaakov’s deed.
<b>Set out and go.</b> This was a veiled warning that he should flee for his safety.

Verse 2



Chapter 29



Chapter 30



Verse 1


<b>If not I am dead.</b> According to the Sages (<i>Baba Basra</i> 116a) a person who leaves offspring is not said to “die” but only to “lie down,” because he will still be remembered.

Verse 23

<b>Elokim has removed my shame.</b> The inability to fulfill one’s purpose is always a source of shame. This is especially true for a barren woman because it means that the reproductive act was one of pure appetite.

Verse 15

<b>For he has sold us.</b> A father usually gives his daughter a dowry, but our father sold us like slaves and took the purchase price — fourteen years of labor — for himself.

Chapter 32



Verse 1

<b>Lavan … returned to his place.</b> He returned to the lowly status that he endured before Yaakov arrived. This foreshadowed the ascendance and subsequent decline of all the nations that hosted and then expelled the Jewish people.

Chapter 33



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>They wept.</b> At that moment love for Eisov awakened in Yaakov as well. Similarly, whenever Eisov’s descendants genuinely acknowledge Yisrael’s greatness, Yisrael reciprocates with feelings of brotherhood.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>I have plenty, my brother.</b> For one thing, I have plenty and do not need more; and for another, I am your brother — not your master — so you need not give me tribute.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Let me leave with you.</b> For your protection and honor.
<b>What for.</b> Why should you go to the trouble and why do I need it?
<b>Let me find favor.</b> It will be more of a favor to me if you do not send them. Eisov understood from this that Yaakov did not really desire his company and left off speaking to him, although at that point he did not have the heart to harm him.

Verse 16

<b>On that day Eisov returned.</b> He was perturbed by Yaakov’s attitude towards him and did not part from him with a kiss as Lavan had done. For this reason Yaakov refrained from visiting him in Seir as he had said he would do.

Chapter 34



Verse 1

<b>Deenah went out.</b> Since Yaakov lived outside of town the verse should have said that she “came in.” However, Scripture wanted to hint that she “went out” of the guidelines of proper behavior by going to watch the locals dance and make merry.

Verse 2



<b>And mistreated her.</b> Elsewhere this word implies deprivation from relations (see Rashi 31:50). She believed that after this no Israelite would want to marry her, but in the end her brother Shimon married her.

Verse 5

<b>Yaakov rose.</b> He forced himself to get up and go. The move was difficult for him because he knew that it marked the beginning of the exile.

<b>That Pharaoh had sent.</b> After Yaakov related to his sons what Hashem had told him, they noted that Pharaoh had also decreed that he be brought to Egypt and a king’s thoughts are determined by Hashem; see <i>Mishlei</i> 21:1.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>His granddaughters.</b> See Rashi. This would mean, however, that Yaakov’s sons fathered only two daughters. It seems more likely only those whose biographies affected the nation are mentioned by name.

Verse 2

<b>To embalm.</b> Yoseif was concerned lest his father’s body begin to decompose during the unusually long mourning period that preceded his interment; see v. 3. According to the Sages Hashem criticized him for this, saying, “Do you think that I am unable to preserve my righteous ones?” It was on account of this that Yoseif died before all his brothers.
