Haamek Davar on Leviticus

Introduction to Leviticus

This book, called [by our Sages] <i>Toras Kohanim</i> (Priestly Law),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“The greatest part of this book deals with the offerings, the laws of the offering itself and of those who perform its rite and of the place where it is to be brought; some commandments are also mentioned incidentally to those dealing with the offerings” (Nachmanides’ Introduction to Leviticus, pg. 4 as translated by Rabbi Dr. Charles B. Chavel).</i> has many more interpretations than the other sections of the Torah, as stated in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 103b:
Our Rabbis taught: Manasseh interpreted <i>Toras Kohanim</i>, (Leviticus), in fifty-five different ways, corresponding to the years of his reign, Ahab [in] eighty-five, and Jeroboam [in] one hundred and three [ways].
Though all the [Torah’s] Books are subject to <i>halachic</i> inferences derived from [analyzing] textual nuances, i.e. additions or textual differences noted between two different <i>parashios</i> dealing with similar subjects <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">An example is discussed below in footnote 25 pertaining to Lev. 5:21-23, that <i>meshichah</i> effects ownership.</i>—as “there is no trivial matter in the entire Torah,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">“[Moshe stated regarding the Torah,] ‘For it is not an empty thing from you’ (Deut. 34:27). [This teaches us that the Torah is never an empty thing], but if it [seems] empty, it is from [i.e., because of] you. Why? Because you do not toil over it” (Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate <i>Peah</i> 1:1).</i>—this particular Book has more interpretations.
And that is because the Sages did not actually originate much of the exegesis or laws found in the <i>Sifra</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifra</i> is the primary collection of <i>Tannaitic</i> exegesis – mainly <i>halachic</i> in nature – on Leviticus. It is also known as <i>Toras Kohanim.</i> However, this title is generally avoided in our writings to avoid confusion with Leviticus, which shares the same name.</i> [by use] of dialectics or [analysis of] textual difficulties; most of this Book’s laws were already known by oral tradition. Being that this Book contains more received laws than all the other Books and since there can be no received law without being alluded to in Scripture,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Netziv is referring to laws that were decided by the previous courts. Scriptural sources are not provided for laws received by Moses from Sinai; see <i>Darkhah Shel Torah</i>, Part 1, Chapter 2.</i> the Sages applied exegesis and explained Scripture in one manner, establishing it as the source for many accepted laws, and applied an another understanding to link the hints contained within Scripture as sources for other traditions; so did they apply this approach to a great extent. However, if those laws had not been received, the [Sages] would not have derived them from the verses.
This [understanding helps explain] how the laws related to <i>Negaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The laws of <i>Negaim</i> are concerned with the ritual uncleanness resulting from <i>Tzara’as</i>, a leprosy-like disease referred to in chapter 13 and 14 of Leviticus.</i> differ from those related to <i>Ohalos</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ohalos</i> deals with the ritual impurity of corpses, and the peculiar quality they have to make all objects in the same tent-like structure impure as well (based on Num. 29: 14-16).</i> as it is taught towards the end of the first chapter of Tractate <i>Chagigah</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">11a.</i> <i>Negaim</i> consists of many verses and fewer <i>halachos</i> [detailed laws], whereas <i>Ohalos</i> consists of fewer verses and many <i>halachos</i>.
Though one God bequeathed both Torah sections of law etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It is unknown to us why God in His infinite wisdom decided to have more oral laws or written laws for particular Torah topics.</i> the [significant] difference between them is not due to the Written Torah but the Oral Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The ratio of the Oral Laws to the Written Laws.</i> <i>Ohalos</i> consisting of many more received laws than <i>Negaim</i>, led the Rabbis to produce more <i>remazim</i>, [Scriptural allusions to the laws] in the area of <i>Ohalos</i> than <i>Negaim</i>.
You can also see that the <i>Tanna</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A Tanna (pl. tannaim) is a Rabbinic sage whose views are recorded in a <i>Mishna</i> or <i>Baraisa</i>. The period of the Tannaim, lasted about 210 years (10-220 C.E.).</i> who authored the <i>Sifre Zuta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifre Zuta</i> is a <i>halachic</i> Midrash on the Book of Numbers attributed to the Tanna, R. Yishmael ben Elisha of the 1st and 2nd centuries. The <i>Sifrei Zuta</i> has not been preserved; the Netziv is most likely referring to the numerous quotations from the <i>Sifre Zuta</i> found in the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> and various Rishonim. An edition of the <i>Sifre Zuta</i>, can be found at www.hebrewbooks.org that was published in Lodz, Poland 1928. This edition – being reconstructed in-part using the recently discovered <i>Midrash HaGadol</i> and the above mentioned sources by Rabbi Chaim Shaul Horovitz (published in Leipzig, Germany 1917) – contains copious notes provided by Rabbi Yaakov Ze’ev Yaskovitz. Part IV to Rabbi Yaskovitz’s introduction to the first volume of this edition contains a listing of the numerous citations of the <i>Sifre Zuta</i> found in the writings of the <i>Rishonim</i>.</i> presents many more Scriptural inferences for the <i>halachos</i> than our <i>Sifre</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The oldest commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy, consisting of a collection of <i>Baraisos</i> compiled by Rav and often quoted in the Talmud.</i> There is no disagreement between them about the actual laws rather, one <i>Tanna</i> exerted himself more to determine the allusion for the previously known laws than the other. Accordingly, this is what is taught in <i>Toras Kohanim</i> in <i>Vayikra</i>, <i>parashah</i> 4, <i>halacha</i> 5,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is also cited in Tractate <i>Zevachim</i> 13a.</i> [R. Tarfon complimented R. Akiva,] “You have expounded and are in agreement with the tradition <i></i>(<i>Shemuah</i>),”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">R. Tarfon had remembered that there where <i>halachic</i> differences between receiving the sacrificial blood and throwing it, but he could not recall what they were. R Akiva, based on his independent derivations from Scripture, explained to R. Tarfon, three differences between them. R. Tarfon then recalled that R. Akiva’s derivation aligned exactly with the traditions that he received and exclaimed, “Akiva, you have expounded [on your own] and are in agreement with the tradition.”</i> i.e., the law is mainly based on <i>Shemuah</i>, meaning an oral tradition passed from one man to another.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">R. Tarfon was hesitant to accept R. Akiva’s derivations, were it not that he recalled that it accorded with what were previously known laws.</i>
Following this entire [discussion, it is important to note that] it is well understood that not all exegesis [within the <i>Sifra</i>] relates to the straightforward meaning of the verses. As we are responsible, <i>la’asos</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">From Deut. 32:46; see following notes for the Netziv’s translation of <i>la’asos</i>.</i> “to produce the words of the Torah” meaning, to understand and elucidate by applying exegesis and analyzing the Scriptural nuances to establish its intended understanding,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. God’s intended understanding and purpose.</i> as we wrote in our commentary to Deut. 32:46<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">[Verse 46:] “He, [Moses], said to them, ‘Apply your hearts to all the words which I bear witness for you this day, so that you may command your children to observe, <i>la’asos</i> (to enhance) all the words of this Torah…. [Verse 47:] For it is not an empty thing for you, for it is your life, and through this thing, you will lengthen your days upon the land to which you are crossing over the Jordan, to possess it.’” A common translation of the phrase, “<i>la’asos es kol divrei haTorah hazos</i>” is “to perform all the words of this Torah.” The Netziv finds such a translation problematic as why would the Torah stress that performing any of God’s <i>mitzvos</i> “is not an empty thing for you?” Would anyone argue that God provides meaningless directives? In addition pertaining to this verse the Jerusalem Talmud in tractate <i>Peah</i> 1:1 states that this verse is referring to the toil of Torah (see Footnote 3).If the verse is stressing the importance of practicing all of the <i>mitzvos</i>, how does the Talmud connect this to the lack of toiling in the Torah in the verse’s next phrase? Therefore, the Netziv translates <i>la’asos es divrei haTorah</i> to be a directive for us to make, i.e., “to enhance [or originate] words [<i>halachos</i>] of the Torah.”</i>; and [this obligation] being more specified in Deut. 6:24: “And the Lord commanded us <i>la’asos</i> (produce) all of these <i>chukim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Netziv, <i>chukim</i> in this context refers to applying analysis or analytical rules, such as the thirteen hermeneutical principles of R. Yishmael. This subject is also expanded by the Netziv in <i>Darkhah Shel Torah</i>, Part 3, Chapter Eight.</i> (laws).” One can find many other verses that express [the imperative in applying this methodology], however this approach is unrelated to the plain meaning of the Torah.
However, the <i>Tannaim</i> certainly derived much exegesis in the <i>Sifra</i> from meticulous analysis of the verses, even when lacking oral traditions. Thus there can be a <i>halachic</i> disagreement among the Tannaim: one master deriving a law one way, while the other [deriving a different law] in an alternate way from [the same verse]. This form of exegesis, is considered to be <i>pshat haMikra</i>, i.e. understanding the plain meaning of the verses, arrived by their careful understanding of the Torah’s language.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 63a, “A verse never departs from its plain meaning.” The Netziv’s understanding of “plain meaning” refers to interpretations that align with the context. “Plain meaning” can be misleading as its understanding may entail much study and analysis. The entire Torah (including the plain meeting) is compared to a poem (Deut. 31:19, as interpreted in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b), where the text is allusive, layered and symbolic (See Netziv’s Preface to <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> chapter 3).</i>
Not only through the Sifra can we comprehend the inferences [applied] to this entire Book, but many inferences are cited in the Talmud. For example, Rava states at the end of chapter four of Tractate <i>Gittin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gittin</i> 48a-b.</i> that we infer from the verse [discussing the sale of land when <i>Yovel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yovel</i>, commonly translated as Jubilee, is the year following the conclusion of a set of seven <i>shemittah</i> cycles. On Yom Kippur of that year, the shofar is sounded, signaling the return of the fields sold in Israel during the previous 49 years to their original owner. Since the field will revert back to the original owner in <i>Yovel</i>, perhaps the buyer is considered as the owner of only the produce and not the land. According to R. Yochanan, the ownership of the right to the produce is tantamount to ownership to the ground to which it is connected, whereas according to Reish Lakish the buyer is not the owner of the land, as the right to the produce is not tantamount to ownership to the ground to which it is connected.</i> is observed] that the ownership of the right to the produce is not tantamount to ownership of the [ground] to which it is connected.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">It is written regarding a sale of land while the law of <i>Yovel</i> is in force, “According to the number of <i>crop-years</i> shall he sell it to you” (Lev. 25:15). The straightforward reading of the verse implies that only the crops are sold (for the number of years between the sale and <i>Yovel</i>), not the essence of the land. Rava uses this verse to support the ruling of Reish Lakish that the buyer is not the owner of the land but is the owner only of the produce.</i> And in Tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> 48a [Rava] infers from the verses [in Lev. 5:21-23] that <i>meshicha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meshichah</i> is a method used for possessing movables by drawing towards oneself the object to be acquired. In the fourth chapter of Tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i>, there is a disagreement as to how movable property is acquired according to Torah law. According to R. Yochanan, the payment of money is the Biblical means of acquiring movables; whereas according to Reish Lakish, it is <i>meshichah</i> – not the payment of money.</i> effects ownership.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rava infers that according to Torah law, <i>meshichah</i> effects ownership by comparing the verses in Lev. 5:21-23 which list the cases where sacrificial offerings are offered to atone for dishonesty i.e., one who falsely denies his monetary obligation under oath. In verses 21 and 22, the Torah lists five examples involving dishonest denial, one of which is <i>teshumas yad</i>, a loan. According to Rav Chisda, <i>teshumas yad</i> is referring to a loan where the borrower designated a utensil as collateral for the lender, but that collateral was left in the borrower’s possession. Verses 23 and 24 then state one is to make restitution, by returning to the rightful owner the principal and paying an additional fifth of its value, and to complete his atonement by bringing an <i>asham gezalos</i>, a sin offering for dishonesty. Rava ask why when verse 23 repeats the list of items that are to be returned, it omits <i>teshumas yad</i>. He answers that we thus see that according to Biblical law, <i>meshichah</i> effects ownership and since the lender never performed <i>meshichah</i> on the utensil (as it remained with the borrower), the collateral does not belong to the lender.</i>
Likewise, in many <i>parashios</i> we come to discover the significance of the textual nuances through [the study] of the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i>. For instance, the passage of the Yom Kippur [service] found in <i>Acharei Mos</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 16: 1-34.</i> [when describing the sequence of the service] is written in a different order [from what is to be performed by the High Priest].<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on verse 23, citing <i>Yoma</i> 32a, that Lev. 16:23 which describes the entry of High Priest into the Sanctuary is not the proper place for this verse, but that it should rather be read after verse 25; for this entry followed the performance of his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering, as well as the burning of the sacrificial parts of the bull and the he-goat, described in verses 24 and 25 respectively.</i> [However], certainly, according to the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah</i>, 21:7: “’At all times’ (Lev. 16:2)… [teaches us] that any time he [Aharon] wishes to enter [the Holy of Holies] he may enter, provided only that he enter [by first performing the described service] in the prescribed manner.”</i> Aharon was permitted to enter the Holy of Holies daily [provided he performed the service] in the order stated in the passage.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Netziv’s Preface to <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> where he writes that in many places the Torah is written in a manner such that it may be read in two different ways.</i> Thus with respect to Aharon’s [daily entry], the chronology [of the service] is correct [as written]; this is explained by the Gra<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">An acronym for the Gaon [genius] Rabbi Eliyahu [of Vilna].</i> [in <i>Eliyahu Rabbah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Netziv’s Preface <i>to Ha’amek Davar</i>, that when the Torah is written in a manner that it can be read in two different ways, it is considered, <i>p’shuto shel mikra</i>. The order of service as listed in the Torah is exactly as it was followed by Aharon prior to his daily entrance to the Holy of Holies; whereas, reading this <i>parasha</i> in an alternate manner describes the Yom Kippur service.</i> Further, in the passage <i></i>dealing with <i>shechutei chutz</i> (the prohibition of slaughtering offerings outside the Temple Courtyard),<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">These laws are discussed in Lev. 17:1-9.</i> it is clear from the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> that this prohibition<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This is in reference to when the children of Israel were traveling in the wilderness; when one was slaughtering meat (i.e. slitting the animal’s throat) for one’s meal, they were required to be offered as <i>shelamim</i> (peace offerings) within the Tabernacle’s courtyard. The Netziv, based on what the Rambam writes in the laws of <i>Shechitah</i> 4:17, explains that both R. Akiva and R. Yishmael (in Tractate <i>Chulin</i> 17a) agree that Leviticus chapter 17 is referring to both consecrated offerings and meat being slaughtered for an ordinary meal. That is to say that while the children of Israel were traveling in the wilderness, whether one was offering a sacrifice or one was slaughtering meat (i.e. slitting the animal’s throat) for one’s meal, they were to be offered as <i>shelamim</i> (peace offerings) within the Tabernacle’s courtyard. According to R. Akiva, this restriction pertaining to meat for an ordinary meal only applied if one wanted to ritually slaughter the animal; however one was allowed to eat the meat outside of the courtyard if he stabbed the animal instead. According to R. Akiva, the Israelites were allowed to eat meat from stabbed animals, until they entered the Land of Israel. The Torah forbade eating ritually slaughtered meat outside of the courtyard to distance their association with idol worship; idolaters would slit the throat of the animal – not stab it – to obtain an abundance of blood for their offerings. Whereas according to R. Yishmael, it was forbidden in the wilderness to eat any meat for one’s personal meal, unless it was offered as a <i>shelamim</i> sacrifice in the Courtyard. According to R. Yishmael, meat from a stabbed animal was never allowed even when the Israelites were in the wilderness. See Nachmanides ad loc. for an alternate explanation of the disagreement between R. Akiva and R. Yishmael.</i> is applied differently in the wilderness than for future generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim Rabbah</i> 4:6 states, “Many things [first] stated by the Holy One blessed be He [to be kept] were later reversed and permitted… For the Holy One blessed be He required that [when] slaughtering meat for eating [in the wilderness, it should only be done so] if it was brought [as a sacrifice] at the gate of the Tent of Meeting. How is this known? As the Torah states, ‘And [if a person] does not bring it to the Tent of Meeting to present it to the Lord, that person shall be cut off from his people,’ (Lev. 17:9). And what is written there? ‘And [if he] does not bring it to the Tent of Meeting to be offered as a sacrifice to the Lord before His sanctuary, it shall be considered as blood shed for that man, he has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from his people.’ (Lev. 17:4). Whereas, here [in Deut.], He reversed this law and allowed them [to slaughter meat for one’s personal meal in any location one desires]. As the Torah states, ‘However, in all of your soul’s desire you may slaughter and eat meat, according to the blessing of the Lord your God, will have given you in all your cities, the contaminated one and the pure one may eat it, like the deer and like the hart’ (Deut. 12:15). And it is known [that it is discussing slaughtering meat for one’s personal meal] as the Torah states, ‘If the place where the Lord your God will choose to place His name will be far from you, you may slaughter from your cattle and your flocks that the Lord has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat it in your cities according to your heart’s entire desire’ (Deut. 12:20).”</i> And by using this interpretation, the [seeming textual oddities of the] passage can be properly understood<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">By understanding how this <i>parasha</i> includes slaughtering animals for meat for an ordinary meal in the wilderness, we can understand the inexact wording, i.e. the placement of the word, <i>osam</i> (them) in the ending phrase of Lev. 17:5: “…and slaughter peace offerings to the Lord, (<i>osam</i>) them” - the phrase should be written as, “…and slaughter (<i>osam</i>) them as peace offerings to the Lord.” (Translator’s note: The English translations of this verse address this textual difficulty by not translating the verse as it is written but as the latter). However, if <i>osam</i> is translated as “with them,” the phrase is then translated as “and slaughter peace offerings to the Lord with them.” The verse is thus stating that together with peace Offerings, “they,” – meat slaughtered for the purpose of being devoured for pleasure – may be offered. The purpose of requiring in the wilderness that the slaughtering for a personal meal be performed in the Court of the Tabernacle, was to discourage the Children of Israel from offering sacrifices to the demons, as stated ad loc. in verse 7, “And they shall no longer slaughter their sacrifices to the satyrs after which they stray.” However, once they entered the Land of Israel, Peace Offerings could only be offered for the sole purpose of the Almighty and no longer be intermingled with one’s personal benefit. Thus inexact wording is employed here by Scripture to enable the verse be read in both the context of holy sacrifices and the slaughtering of animals for a personal meal.</i>; whereas the Tanna of the [<i>baraisa</i> cited in the] <i>Sifra</i> is only concerned in connecting the traditions to the Scriptural allusions applicable to the subsequent generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifra</i>’s focus being related to the laws applicable to the future generations, it only discusses the derivations that apply to holy sacrifices. As Rashi comments to verse 17:3, “Scripture is speaking of [slaughtering] holy sacrifices [and not of slaughtering ordinary animals], for Scripture continues (verse 4), ‘to offer up as a sacrifice’ – (<i>Sifra</i> 17:91).”</i> Additionally, there are many other verses for which the Scriptural allusions have not been explained by the <i>Sifra</i>, as [its authors] lacked a tradition and thus did not address the nuances.
Humbly and with the assistance of the Divine Dispenser of wisdom, we [too] have derived [the source of various <i>halachos</i>] by examining the Scriptural nuances. Heaven forbid, would we be deriving original interpretations<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The Netziv is referring to originating new laws based on these derivations</i>; rather by examining the Scriptural nuances, we have been able to [connect the verses to] many traditions and laws that have been cited in the Gemorah. For example, by applying examination to the verses in the Torah reading of <i>B’Chukosai</i>, we have shown [the source of the <i>halacha</i> stated] by Rava that <i>hekdesh mafkia midei shibud</i>, “consecration cancels the lien of a creditor,”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"> If a borrower designates his property (real or moveable) for collection in case he is unable to pay his obligation (called <i>apotiki</i>), and then consequently consecrates his property to the Temple or as a sacrifice, the lender’s lien is dissolved. See Tractates <i>Yevamos</i> 46a, 66b, <i>Kesuvos</i> 59b, <i>Gittin</i> 40b and <i>Bava Kamma</i> 89b.</i> and thus this <i>halacha</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Netziv, in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> to Lev. 27:15, describes the scriptural source for Rava in the following manner: “Lev., Chapter 27 describes how when one redeems items consecrated to the Temple, he is to pay the valuation money (i.e. the principle) plus a fifth. When stating the redemption of houses in verse 15 and fields in verse 19, the one performing the redemption is described as the one ‘who consecrated it’: whereas pertaining to the redemption of animals described in verse 13, there is no mention of ‘who consecrated it, but it merely states ’if he redeems it.’ Rava in <i>Bava Metzia</i> 54b infers from ‘who consecrated it’ stated about the redemption of houses, that the one who consecrated the house in the first place adds a fifth; however if one redeems an item that he had used to redeem something else he does not add a fifth.” The Netziv asks why it is also necessary to state in verse 19 that the field is redeemed by “who consecrated it,” as it is obvious that the one who redeems it is the one who consecrated it, i.e. the original owner? Further why is the phrase “who consecrated it” not stated also in the verse discussing the redemption of animals? The Netziv answers that it is from these words that Rava infers that “consecration cancels the lien of a creditor.” It is only the one who sanctified it who is the subject of the verse – not anyone else who may have a lien on the field such as a lender. The fact that redemption is effective demonstrates that any existing liens on the property were cancelled by the owner’s sanctification. It was not necessary to state about the redemption of animals, “who sanctified it” – as it is self-understood that the verse would not need to exclude the case of a lender; as animals are not usually used as <i>apotiki</i> , since they can be hidden or smuggled away (see Rashi in Tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> 67b).</i> becomes greatly illuminated.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This understanding of the scriptural source, i.e. the redemption of consecrated fields, “supports the Rambam’s opinion in <i>Hilchos Arachin</i> 7:14, that the law that consecration cancels the lien of a creditor,” applies to any form of consecration, unlike the opinion of Rashi and Tosafos that the lien of the creditor is only cancelled with consecration of an animal for a sacrifice.</i> There are many more [inferences found] in this Book [of Leviticus]. We have already shown in our compilation <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i> in siman 67<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 4a states that according to R. Yehoshua ben Levi, one is obligated to read the <i>Megillah</i> in the evening and to repeat it in the day, as it is written in Ps. 22:3: “My God, I cry in the daytime, but You have not answered, and at night and am not silent.” R. Chelbo stated the ruling of R. Yehoshua b. Levi based on the verse, “So that Your glory be sung to You [i.e. by day] and not be silent [i.e. by night]. O Lord, my God, I will give praise to You forever” (Ps. 30: 13). When citing this <i>halacha</i>, the <i>She’iltos</i> only quotes the latter verse and not the former. The Netziv explains that the <i>She’iltos</i> is of the opinion that according to R. Yehoshua, the <i>Megillah</i> may be read in the evening beginning with <i>plag hamincha</i>, 1¼ <i>halachic</i> hours before sunset. The Netziv states a rule that when a verse states “<i>lailah</i>,” night, in reference to the performance of a <i>mitzvah</i>, the <i>mitzvah</i> may only be performed at night beginning with <i>tzeis hakochavim</i>, the appearance of three stars. The <i>She’iltos</i>, by not referencing the verse from Ps. 22:3 which states “night,” is stressing that the time for reading the <i>Megillah</i> begins with <i>plag hamincha</i>, even before the appearance of three stars. See Netziv ad loc., where he explains how the <i>She’iltos</i> interprets Ps. 22:3 in the following manner: “’My God, I cry in the daytime… even though at night I am not silent.’ Even if I delay the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> to the night, i.e. <i>tzeis hakochavim</i>, which is considered nighttime for every <i>mitzvah</i>, I still need to read the <i>Megillah</i> again by day.”</i> and 103<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">When listing the seven relatives for which a Kohen may defile himself, Lev. 21:1-3 states, ”Let none [of you] defile himself for a dead person among his people, except for his <i>she’ar</i> who is close to him… he shall defile himself.” The <i>Sifra</i> (1:4) translates “his <i>she’ar</i>” as “his wife” based on Lev. 18:12, “The nakedness of your father’s sister you shall not uncover, she is your father’s <i>she’ar</i>.” The Netziv explains that the <i>Sifra</i> accords with R. Elazar, cited in Tractate <i>Kesuvos</i> 47b, that <i>she’ar</i> means conjugal relations and that <i>she’ar</i> is associated with “wife” – as she is the one who is designated for such a relationship. The <i>Sifra</i> translates Lev. 18:12 as, “The nakedness of your father’s sister you shall not uncover, she is like your father’s conjugal relations” – meaning due to the close relationship between your father and his sister, if one has relations with his aunt, it is considered as if he is having conjugal relations with his father. However, the <i>She’ltos</i> writes that <i>she’ar</i> means wife based on Ex. 21:10: “He shall not diminish her <i>she’ar</i>, her clothing.” The Netziv explains that the <i>She’iltos</i> follows the opinion of R. Eliezer ben Yaakov in <i>Kesubos</i> ad loc., that <i>she’ar</i> means “flesh,” and expounds Ex. 21:10 as, “He shall not diminish according to her flesh (bodily state), her clothing, (or clothing) needed for the particular season of the year.” Since <i>she’ar</i> means flesh, we thus know that “his <i>she’ar</i> who is close to him,” stated in Lev. 18:21 is referring to the Kohen’s wife, who is his flesh, similar to how Gen 2:24 describes Adam and Eve as “becoming one flesh.” Thus according to the <i>She’iltos</i>, Ex. 21:10 is not including a Biblical requirement for the husband to provide his wife with conjugal relations.</i> that our master the <i>Sheiltos</i> attributes many <i>halachos</i> in the Gemorah to Scriptural inferences not stated in the Talmud; and with the noting of these Scriptural inferences, the <i>halacha</i> becomes further clarified.
It has been stated in <i>Bereishis Rabbah</i> 3: “And God saw that the Light was good,” refers to the Book of Leviticus which is filled with numerous laws.
The apparent understanding of this Midrash is just as it is beneficial to the eyes [i.e. for the one perceiving the light] to see the sun (i.e. the source of the light), and thus one appreciates the light even more; such is it beneficial to perceive in the Book of Leviticus, the source of the numerous laws found in the Talmud. [For by knowing the source of the laws] one understands the light of the laws even more.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah’s statement, “And God saw that the light was good” (Gen.1:4), means that God had created man with an intellect whose capability for comprehension is greatly enhanced when he actually sees or experiences that which he is studying. Similarly, when the sources of the Torah laws are “seen” – in other words, understood – his understanding of these concepts is greatly enhanced. See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Gen. 1:4.</i>
There yet remain many other inferences of the verses that remain to be revealed and explained, but we lack the opportunity to complete this task. May the Omnipresent, may He be blessed in His Mercy, reveal to us the essence of its light, and assist us in strengthening the [future] soldiers of Torah, [in completing this task], Amen!

<b>He certainly incurred guilt.</b> Why does the Torah require a more expensive offering for a case of doubt than a case of certainty? Similarly, why is a guilt-offering more expensive than a sin-offering, and yet a guilt-offering is brought for a sin which is lighter than that of a sin-offering? This is because any sin subject to a light punishment in Heaven has its punishment meted out in this world instead, where punishment is much easier to bear than the World to Come. Thus, the offering for a lighter sin which is a candidate for punishment in this world will be more expensive since it comes to atone for a spiritual punishment. For example, someone who was in doubt about eating forbidden fat must bring an offering which protects from suffering, and thus, it is more expensive.

<b>You shall not go out for seven days -</b> That is during the time of offering the sacrifices of the inauguration.

Rebbi Zeira said, "'It was on the day that Moses stopped erecting the tabernacle' (Numbers 7:1) - on the day the erections stopped." 
<b>because for seven days your hands will be filled - </b> Scripture explained a reason for this commandment. As behold, it is not similar to that which Moshe warned (forbade) on the eighth day (Leviticus 10:7), "From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not go out, etc." For then the service was incumbent upon the priests, which was not the case during these seven days, when the service was incumbent upon Moshe. For that reason, it gave the reason that they would fill their hands on the seven days, the understanding of which is to study and train the hands with care. For this reason, it warned them to stay and watch Moshe's actions these seven days.

Verse 3

<b>You shall speak, saying.</b> Moshe himself did not speak because the people of Israel become close to their Father in Heaven through the Avodah that is performed truthfully by Aharon and his sons. Therefore, Moshe made Aharon accustomed to be the one who would command them.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>And the entire congregation approached.</b> Every place that the Torah mentions ‘approaching’ it implies becoming closer than usual. Toras Kohanim interprets this way as well: “They all approached in rejoicing.” It might be also possible to say that the verse is teaching us what is mentioned in Berachos (6b) that when one is going to a Beis Knesses there is a mitzvah to run.

Chapter 10



Verse 1

<b>Aharon’s sons Nodov and Avihu.</b> It does not say, “Nodov and Avihu, Aharon’s sons,” and from this Chazal derived in Toras Kohanim that they did not show appropriate respect for Aharon, and they behaved as if they were not his sons.


<b>a strange fire, which He had not commanded them:</b> The language is not precise. As behold, it was forbidden to bring a strange fire. So how is it fit to say, "which He had not commanded" - as it implies that they were also not prohibited about it. And see what the Baal HaTurim wrote; and the homiletical approach mentioned in the Herchav Devar, that they came in with the fire of enthusiasm of the love of God. Whereas the Torah said that even though the love of God is precious in the eyes of God, it is not so when it is in this fashion that was not commanded, and as I wrote above in the name of the Torat Kohanim on the verse, "And Moshe said, 'This is the thing, etc.'" (Leviticus 9:6).   


Verse 2

<b>And they died in the presence of Adonoy.</b> The Attribute of Justice immediately struck them down because they were before Hashem in the palace of the King, the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>Aharon’s uncle [<i>dod</i>].</b> According to the plain meaning the expression <i>dod</i> connotes friendship, and the verse explains why Moshe called the sons of Uziel instead of the sons of Yitzhar, for example. This was because Moshe knew that some of Aharon’s relatives were jealous of Aharon’s glory, and he was afraid they would seem to be happy at his misfortune. Therefore Moshe called the sons of Uziel because he knew Uziel loved Aharon and was close to him, and Uziel would be pained over Aharon’s pain. Uziel’s sons, as well, were very humble; we see Mishael’s great humility from the fact that his younger brother became the Nasi of Kehos and he did not protest at all, and Elzafan is written without a <i>yud</i>, which shows that he was humble in his own selfappraisal, as is known to those who interpret names.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>Your brothers, the entire House of Yisroel shall weep.</b> This weeping was during the time of the funeral and burial, and there was nothing exceptional about this weeping, for even women will weep for the loss of one of the great ones of Yisroel. The expression ‘shall weep,’ however, still needs to be understood. How is it possible to command them to weep? Weeping depends solely on one’s emotional state. It seems, therefore, that Moshe is telling them <i>how</i> to weep. Since the verse says, “יבכו את השרפה” [weep over the conflagration] and not “על השרפה” it means to say with the conflagration. This teaches that someone who was in pain and needed to pray and cry out to Hashem for some other matter, he should weep at the time the lofty departed one was in front of him, because that is an auspicious time to uplift his cry and plea, due to the honor he accomplishes in this way for the departed one.

<b>And say to them.</b> It is difficult to speak about the matters of a discharge flow and an involuntary seminal emission, which are from the organs of reproduction that are affected by one’s thoughts. Therefore, we might have thought that it would be better to avoid speaking about them or studying their laws, and that Moshe alone would have to teach the Oral Law he received in these matters to the people of Israel so it would not be forgotten. However, after he already taught them, there would no longer be a commandment to delve deeply into them. This would be unlike the commandment of Torah study for all other commandments, which is a commandment even when there is no practical benefit from the study or a benefit for remembering the laws. For this reason it says in this section, “And say to them” (אמרתם, plural form), which is a directive to Aharon as well to teach the people of Israel, and the same applies for any teacher and his students. This is because in truth no bad thing ever comes from Torah study.

Chapter 16



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Speak to your brother Aharon.</b> This was already interpreted in Toras Kohanim that the same thing applies to his sons; regular <i>kohanim</i> are included in this warning. If so, why does it say “to Aharon” and not “to Aharon and his sons”? It must be that this section was said solely to Aharon, as it says in the Midrash Rabbah on this section: Aharon was permitted to enter into the Holy of Holies every day. However, it had to be with this preparation. This is derived from here because Yom Kippur was not mentioned in all this matter until afterwards. His sons, on the other hand, were only permitted to enter on Yom Kippur.

<b>And atone for it:</b> And it is taught in Torat Kohanim, "Atonement, which is for itself." The understanding is that it is not like the atonement that is on the curtain, such that he first atoned on the holy itself, as I have written, and afterward atoned for the Jewish people. But this atonement of the altar is only to atone upon it itself and not upon the iniquity of the Jewish people. And that is why the verse concludes, <b> and he shall take from the blood of the bull and from the blood of the goat, etc.</b> — in a mixture, and not like that with the curtain. And that is, that since it does not come for the atonement of the Jewish people but only for the altar by itself, it is fine to mix the blood of the bull that comes for the priests together with the blood of the goat that comes for the Jewish people. And also resolved with this is that which the verse had, <i>and atone for it</i>, before the act, which is not like the way of Scripture in every [other] place.

Verse 21




<b>To the desert.</b> The connotation is that he should go freely in the desert … In any case, the verse does not depart from its plain meaning, and the sending works in one of two ways. If the generation merits, the goat goes down to a desolate land, as found in Targum Yonason. If the generation is not worthy, the opposite happens, and the goat strengthens itself and flees to the desert, as it says in the Yerushalmi: “All the days that Shimon HaTzaddik was alive the goat would break up into its limbs before it reached even half the mountain, but after Shimon HaTzaddik died it would flee to the desert and the nomads would eat it”.

<b>Before Hashem you will be purified.</b> The verse cautions a person to hurry and repent and purify himself before Hashem purifies him [automatically] at the end of the day of Yom Kippur. Thus it means: “Before Hashem you shall purify yourselves.” This is comparable to a child that soils himself and his father comes to wash him up and cleanse him. A clever man came and told him, “Aren’t you ashamed to cause this burden to your father? Hurry up and wash yourself as much as possible before your father comes.” So, too, repentance atones for [the negation of] a positive commandment without the essence of the day of Yom Kippur. This is what is meant by the phrase that a man will purify himself. By Hashem’s decree, however, the essence of the day atones for a negative commandment [with repentance] or a positive commandment even without repentance. The verse is saying to cleanse yourselves before Hashem comes and cleanses you.

<b>You shall not withhold the wages.</b> If a person permissibly gained possession of someone else’s property, such as by a loan or the like, but he does not intend to return it is called עושק (oppression) and not גזל (stealing). Stealing is only is the case of, “And he grabbed (ויגזול) the spear from the hand of the Egyptian” (Shmuel II 23:21), which is that he forcibly grabbed it in the first place.
<b>You shall not rob.</b> Scripture only needs to speak about a case where he intends to return it the next day, nevertheless, it is called robbery for a day. <b>It shall not remain overnight, the wages of a day-laborer.</b> Although it is only the payment of a loan, and he intends to pay later, nevertheless, the wages of a day-laborer are different, as the Torah explains in another place (Devarim 24:15), “You shall give him his wage on his day … for he is poor, and he risks his life for it”.

<b>Holy, praises to Adonoy.</b> Although the laws of the fourth year’s fruits are like <i>maaser sheni </i>(the second tithes that are taken to be eaten in Jerusalem), as is known, nevertheless, the Torah explains that the purpose of this mitzvah is not like <i>maaser sheni</i>. Concerning <i>maaser sheni</i> it says, “in order that you will learn to fear Hashem, etc.” The Sages explained (Sifrei, Parshas Re’eh) that <i>maaser sheni</i> was only given for the sake of Torah study and the fear of Hashem. This is not so regarding the mitzvah of the fruits of the fourth year. Its purpose is so that they will say praises to Hashem, which means that they should bless Hashem before His Presence in Jerusalem, the source of blessing. This will be a benefit for them to increase their future produce, and we learn from this that blessings add Divine influence to the field’s crops. The Sages learned from this verse that one should never have any pleasure from the world without making a blessing beforehand, and this is so there will be Divine influence in the crops.

The Festivals are especially [favorable] for the livelihood in Eretz Yisrael since they are all New Years, and the Festival offering and the rest of the Festival commandments are beneficial for blessing.

Here, Scripture adds that even if, Heaven forbid, the generation is lax about illicit relations, and this is a cause for exile from the Land of Israel, nevertheless, if they are diligent in Torah study then the merit of the Torah will assist that the Land of Israel will not vomit them out. Rather, they will be punished at that time in the Land of Israel. This is stated in Nedarim (81a) in reference to the verse (Yirmiyahu 9:11), “Why is the Land of Israel ruined? …” — this matter was asked to the wise men and to the prophets, and the response came in the words of Hashem (ibid. 12), “Because they have forsaken My Torah.” Although it is known that during the Destruction of the First Temple there was idolatry, illicit relations, and bloodshed, in any case, if it were not for forsaking the Torah the Land of Israel would not have been completely destroyed.

<b>[A day] of holy assembly.</b> The purpose of the appointed times, the reason Hashem wanted Israel to gather in Jerusalem and be seen in the Courtyard, is so they could learn wisdom and discipline from the <i>kohanim</i>. Jerusalem is the source for the entire word of Hashem, and there they learned how to behave when they returned to their homes after the festival. In the festival’s first days all of Israel was busy with the sight-offerings, festival-offerings, and peace-offerings of vows and free-will from the entire year; they were brought during the intermediate days of the festival. Only on the festival’s last day were there no longer any sight-offerings of festival-offerings, except for someone who transgressed and did not bring them in the first days. This was not appropriate, and therefore it was not common to find these offerings. Thus, the entire people of Israel was free at that time to accept discipline and rebuke, and that is why the eighth day was called Atzeret, a day of convocation.

And behold, "I am the Lord Your God" (Lev 23:43): Your Leader and Protector forever and there is nothing blocking from the One who is Blessed to bestow goodness and blessing even from those who don't hold an inheritance.

According to the plain meaning: He should pay minimally, according to the animal’s value; for besides the differences in the animal’s skill or work, there is also an evaluation based on its lineage — someone who had the horse upon whom the king rode … he is obligated to pay only its minimum worth.

<b>And each man shall return to his ancestral land</b> — even if he has no ancestral land he goes back to his main family and all the family heads are gathered together.

<b>If you shall say.</b> In truth all this is nothing but miraculous — in a year without any planting, the grain and fruit of the trees will grow enough to satiate the entire population of people and animals. It is known that path of miracles is only appropriate to the extent that one prepares for it, and this is what it says previously in Scripture: “You shall fulfill My statutes, etc.” This means they should increase their continuous study of Torah and its sharp give and take in those years. They should believe and completely give themselves over to this lofty manner of conducting themselves … Thus, one might think the main mitzvah of the Sabbatical and Jubilee year was only given to those who conduct themselves with this extra high level. However, this is not true, for the Torah can be kept completely even by people who are not on this level. This is why Scripture explains, “If you will say …” — if you will not be on this level, then “I will command” — this is personal Hashgachah in the way of nature.

<b>You shall grant redemption to the land.</b> Even if it is already sold to non-Jews it is a mitzvah to redeem it so that it will not be worked in the Sabbatical year … Even regarding our day and age it says in Gittin (8b) that for the sake of settling Eretz Yisrael it is a mitzvah to redeem a field from a non-Jew, and so much the more so when the people of Israel are dwelling in Eretz Yisrael. It says, “In all of your ancestral lands” — there is only a mitzvah when all of Eretz Yisrael is in the possession of the people of Israel. This is not so if all of Eretz Yisrael is in the hands of non-Jews, and it is impossible to redeem it all; there is no mitzvah to redeem a certain location. This is the plain meaning of Scripture, and you may derive from it the <i>drashot</i> as well.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>[Or] if the man has no redeemer.</b> This is extra, and it comes to teach about the way of ethical discipline. The one who has no redeemer will achieve the means to redeem his land, for the one who has a redeemer upon whom he relies removes his trust from Hashem. This is not the case if someone has no one else to rely on; such a person finds shelter only with Hashem. It says here, “man,” which teaches that even one who trusts in Hashem must nonetheless be a “man,” one who recognizes his Creator and makes every effort in prayer and supplication from Hashem, Blessed be He.

Verse 47



Verse 48

<b>After he is sold.</b> This teaches that at first he should try not to be sold, but if he is sold, then nonetheless, “redemption shall be his.” In Toras Kohanim the Baraita taught the opposite: “If he came and said: ‘I am about to be sold,’ we might have thought we have to help him, therefore the Torah says, ‘after he is sold.’” That is, if he comes to his relatives and says, “If you do not help me I will sell myself to a foreigner,” and he will be a disgrace to the family … Nevertheless, what I wrote is true, and it is implied by the verse’s plain meaning that if they know he is poor and is prepared to sell himself, in truth they should make an effort that he will not come to this.

<b>Thereby breaking My covenant.</b> This includes two connotations: One is the covenant that the people of Israel made with Hashem to be His nation, to keep the Torah and mitzvos. They would break this covenant solely due to their desires. It also includes breaking another covenant which Hashem made with the people of Israel to watch over them. Because they wanted to throw off the yoke of Torah and mitzvos, they increased in rebelliousness and did things to anger Hashem, disgusting things of which they were in truth not worthy. They only did them so He would remove His Divine Presence from the Holy Land and from the people of Israel. They thought that if Hashem would remove His Divine Presence from them they could be like all the other nations and all the other lands, under the guidance of the celestial kingdom, which is the sun. The Torah numbers seven transgressions: 1) Agreement not to do for the sake of Hashem. 2) Not to do at all. 3) Despising one who does according to the ways of tradition. 4) Despising the study of Torah in general. 5) Trying to prevent anyone from doing according to the Torah. 6) Trying to cast off the entire yoke of Heaven’s kingship. 7) Doing deeds to anger Hashem so that Hashem will break His covenant with us.

<b>You will be lost among the nations.</b> The exiled Jews will be lost among the gentile nations, for none of the nations’ leaders will watch over them in pity or try to bring them close, as is the usual nature of royalty that befriends the refuges in their country. Instead, you will be despised because they will see you pursuing one another.

<b>Whether it is good or bad.</b> He should appraise it specifically according to its worth, and not add to its value for the benefit of the Temple treasury.  
<b>As the <i>kohein </i>determines its value for you so shall it be.</b> Nevertheless, if the <i>kohein</i> erred and did not appraise it according to its real worth — as he determined the value, so shall it be.

Verse 27

<b>If it is of an unclean animal he shall redeem it.</b> This is speaking about one who consecrates a first-born ritually unclean animal, which is not a first-born donkey, because their custom was to consecrate the firstling to Heaven so they would have success with the future offspring. As a matter of course we learn that the same law applies for someone who consecrates a ritually unclean animal that is not a first-born. It needs to be understood why the verse uses the language ופדה (he shall redeem) and not וגאל like the rest of the <i>parshah</i>, and in this very verse it says, “If it is not redeemed (יגאל).” It seems that the answer is because the implication of ופדה is for its worth, and וגאל connotes any amount.
