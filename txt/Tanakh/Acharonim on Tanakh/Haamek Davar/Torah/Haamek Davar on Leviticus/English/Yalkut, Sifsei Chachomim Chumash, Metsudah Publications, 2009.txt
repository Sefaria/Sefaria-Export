<b>He certainly incurred guilt.</b> Why does the Torah require a more expensive offering for a case of doubt than a case of certainty? Similarly, why is a guilt-offering more expensive than a sin-offering, and yet a guilt-offering is brought for a sin which is lighter than that of a sin-offering? This is because any sin subject to a light punishment in Heaven has its punishment meted out in this world instead, where punishment is much easier to bear than the World to Come. Thus, the offering for a lighter sin which is a candidate for punishment in this world will be more expensive since it comes to atone for a spiritual punishment. For example, someone who was in doubt about eating forbidden fat must bring an offering which protects from suffering, and thus, it is more expensive.

Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>You shall speak, saying.</b> Moshe himself did not speak because the people of Israel become close to their Father in Heaven through the Avodah that is performed truthfully by Aharon and his sons. Therefore, Moshe made Aharon accustomed to be the one who would command them.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>And the entire congregation approached.</b> Every place that the Torah mentions ‘approaching’ it implies becoming closer than usual. Toras Kohanim interprets this way as well: “They all approached in rejoicing.” It might be also possible to say that the verse is teaching us what is mentioned in Berachos (6b) that when one is going to a Beis Knesses there is a mitzvah to run.

Chapter 10



Verse 1

<b>Aharon’s sons Nodov and Avihu.</b> It does not say, “Nodov and Avihu, Aharon’s sons,” and from this Chazal derived in Toras Kohanim that they did not show appropriate respect for Aharon, and they behaved as if they were not his sons.

Verse 2

<b>And they died in the presence of Adonoy.</b> The Attribute of Justice immediately struck them down because they were before Hashem in the palace of the King, the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>Aharon’s uncle [<i>dod</i>].</b> According to the plain meaning the expression <i>dod</i> connotes friendship, and the verse explains why Moshe called the sons of Uziel instead of the sons of Yitzhar, for example. This was because Moshe knew that some of Aharon’s relatives were jealous of Aharon’s glory, and he was afraid they would seem to be happy at his misfortune. Therefore Moshe called the sons of Uziel because he knew Uziel loved Aharon and was close to him, and Uziel would be pained over Aharon’s pain. Uziel’s sons, as well, were very humble; we see Mishael’s great humility from the fact that his younger brother became the Nasi of Kehos and he did not protest at all, and Elzafan is written without a <i>yud</i>, which shows that he was humble in his own selfappraisal, as is known to those who interpret names.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>Your brothers, the entire House of Yisroel shall weep.</b> This weeping was during the time of the funeral and burial, and there was nothing exceptional about this weeping, for even women will weep for the loss of one of the great ones of Yisroel. The expression ‘shall weep,’ however, still needs to be understood. How is it possible to command them to weep? Weeping depends solely on one’s emotional state. It seems, therefore, that Moshe is telling them <i>how</i> to weep. Since the verse says, “יבכו את השרפה” [weep over the conflagration] and not “על השרפה” it means to say with the conflagration. This teaches that someone who was in pain and needed to pray and cry out to Hashem for some other matter, he should weep at the time the lofty departed one was in front of him, because that is an auspicious time to uplift his cry and plea, due to the honor he accomplishes in this way for the departed one.

<b>The hare.</b> This is written in the feminine form because that it what it was called by Adam, the first man. The names used by Adam in the Holy Tongue are based on the activity he recognized in the inner aspect of that creature, and in a species where that activity was stronger in the female it was named after the female.

<b>To distinguish.</b> It is a positive commandment to investigate and check anything that is a doubt if it is unclean or clean according to the signs … And even according to the Rambam’s view that a doubt in a matter of Torah law is permitted according to Torah law, nevertheless, as long as it is possible to clarify it is a positive commandment by Torah law to check and clarify …

<b>A skin-eruption of <i>tzora’as</i>.</b> Although it has previously been clarified that the word <i>nega</i> (skin-eruption) is only used when it is already [known to be] unclean, nevertheless, this usage of the word here comes to teach us that even if the man knows by himself that in the end it will be unclean he must still be brought to the <i>kohein</i>.

Chapter 15



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>And say to them.</b> It is difficult to speak about the matters of a discharge flow and an involuntary seminal emission, which are from the organs of reproduction that are affected by one’s thoughts. Therefore, we might have thought that it would be better to avoid speaking about them or studying their laws, and that Moshe alone would have to teach the Oral Law he received in these matters to the people of Israel so it would not be forgotten. However, after he already taught them, there would no longer be a commandment to delve deeply into them. This would be unlike the commandment of Torah study for all other commandments, which is a commandment even when there is no practical benefit from the study or a benefit for remembering the laws. For this reason it says in this section, “And say to them” (אמרתם, plural form), which is a directive to Aharon as well to teach the people of Israel, and the same applies for any teacher and his students. This is because in truth no bad thing ever comes from Torah study.

Chapter 16



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Speak to your brother Aharon.</b> This was already interpreted in Toras Kohanim that the same thing applies to his sons; regular <i>kohanim</i> are included in this warning. If so, why does it say “to Aharon” and not “to Aharon and his sons”? It must be that this section was said solely to Aharon, as it says in the Midrash Rabbah on this section: Aharon was permitted to enter into the Holy of Holies every day. However, it had to be with this preparation. This is derived from here because Yom Kippur was not mentioned in all this matter until afterwards. His sons, on the other hand, were only permitted to enter on Yom Kippur.

<b>To the desert.</b> The connotation is that he should go freely in the desert … In any case, the verse does not depart from its plain meaning, and the sending works in one of two ways. If the generation merits, the goat goes down to a desolate land, as found in Targum Yonason. If the generation is not worthy, the opposite happens, and the goat strengthens itself and flees to the desert, as it says in the Yerushalmi: “All the days that Shimon HaTzaddik was alive the goat would break up into its limbs before it reached even half the mountain, but after Shimon HaTzaddik died it would flee to the desert and the nomads would eat it”.

<b>Before Hashem you will be purified.</b> The verse cautions a person to hurry and repent and purify himself before Hashem purifies him [automatically] at the end of the day of Yom Kippur. Thus it means: “Before Hashem you shall purify yourselves.” This is comparable to a child that soils himself and his father comes to wash him up and cleanse him. A clever man came and told him, “Aren’t you ashamed to cause this burden to your father? Hurry up and wash yourself as much as possible before your father comes.” So, too, repentance atones for [the negation of] a positive commandment without the essence of the day of Yom Kippur. This is what is meant by the phrase that a man will purify himself. By Hashem’s decree, however, the essence of the day atones for a negative commandment [with repentance] or a positive commandment even without repentance. The verse is saying to cleanse yourselves before Hashem comes and cleanses you.

<b>You shall not withhold the wages.</b> If a person permissibly gained possession of someone else’s property, such as by a loan or the like, but he does not intend to return it is called עושק (oppression) and not גזל (stealing). Stealing is only is the case of, “And he grabbed (ויגזול) the spear from the hand of the Egyptian” (Shmuel II 23:21), which is that he forcibly grabbed it in the first place.
<b>You shall not rob.</b> Scripture only needs to speak about a case where he intends to return it the next day, nevertheless, it is called robbery for a day. <b>It shall not remain overnight, the wages of a day-laborer.</b> Although it is only the payment of a loan, and he intends to pay later, nevertheless, the wages of a day-laborer are different, as the Torah explains in another place (Devarim 24:15), “You shall give him his wage on his day … for he is poor, and he risks his life for it”.

<b>Holy, praises to Adonoy.</b> Although the laws of the fourth year’s fruits are like <i>maaser sheni </i>(the second tithes that are taken to be eaten in Jerusalem), as is known, nevertheless, the Torah explains that the purpose of this mitzvah is not like <i>maaser sheni</i>. Concerning <i>maaser sheni</i> it says, “in order that you will learn to fear Hashem, etc.” The Sages explained (Sifrei, Parshas Re’eh) that <i>maaser sheni</i> was only given for the sake of Torah study and the fear of Hashem. This is not so regarding the mitzvah of the fruits of the fourth year. Its purpose is so that they will say praises to Hashem, which means that they should bless Hashem before His Presence in Jerusalem, the source of blessing. This will be a benefit for them to increase their future produce, and we learn from this that blessings add Divine influence to the field’s crops. The Sages learned from this verse that one should never have any pleasure from the world without making a blessing beforehand, and this is so there will be Divine influence in the crops.

<b>You shall keep My Shabbosos.</b> According to the plain meaning these warnings are advice for our livelihood, by keeping Shabbos and Festivals. This is because it says regarding Shabbos, “You may do your work six days but on the seventh day you must cease,” and the Rabbis taught in Mechilta: If you cease on the seventh day you will do your work all the six days without any hindrance, and you will also meet all your needs in them. The Festivals are especially [favorable] for the livelihood in Eretz Yisrael since they are all New Years, and the Festival offering and the rest of the Festival commandments are beneficial for blessing.

<b>You shall keep all of My statutes.</b> We have explained that keeping the statues and the laws, which are the Talmudic questions and answers, protects a person that he will not come to the point of illicit relations. Here, Scripture adds that even if, Heaven forbid, the generation is lax about illicit relations, and this is a cause for exile from the Land of Israel, nevertheless, if they are diligent in Torah study then the merit of the Torah will assist that the Land of Israel will not vomit them out. Rather, they will be punished at that time in the Land of Israel. This is stated in Nedarim (81a) in reference to the verse (Yirmiyahu 9:11), “Why is the Land of Israel ruined? …” — this matter was asked to the wise men and to the prophets, and the response came in the words of Hashem (ibid. 12), “Because they have forsaken My Torah.” Although it is known that during the Destruction of the First Temple there was idolatry, illicit relations, and bloodshed, in any case, if it were not for forsaking the Torah the Land of Israel would not have been completely destroyed.

<b>A Pesach (offering) for Adonoy.</b> This time period is also called an “appointed time” because <i>melachah</i> is prohibited while bringing the Pesach offering, and it is a “holy assembly” for reciting Hallel during the offering of the Pesach. Therefore, it says here “in the afternoon” because it is only called an “appointed time” in the afternoon.

<b>I will cause that person to perish.</b> This is more severe than the punishment for eating, and the reason is as the Seforno wrote: One who works on Yom Kippur does so out of spite, or he does not believe in the day’s holiness, whereas someone who eats does so out of desire.

Verse 36

<b>[A day] of holy assembly.</b> The purpose of the appointed times, the reason Hashem wanted Israel to gather in Jerusalem and be seen in the Courtyard, is so they could learn wisdom and discipline from the <i>kohanim</i>. Jerusalem is the source for the entire word of Hashem, and there they learned how to behave when they returned to their homes after the festival. In the festival’s first days all of Israel was busy with the sight-offerings, festival-offerings, and peace-offerings of vows and free-will from the entire year; they were brought during the intermediate days of the festival. Only on the festival’s last day were there no longer any sight-offerings of festival-offerings, except for someone who transgressed and did not bring them in the first days. This was not appropriate, and therefore it was not common to find these offerings. Thus, the entire people of Israel was free at that time to accept discipline and rebuke, and that is why the eighth day was called Atzeret, a day of convocation.

<b>Whoever kills an animal shall pay for it.</b> It should have said ישלם [instead of ישלמנה]. This is the source for the halachic derivation (Baba Kama 10b): He shall complete it [ישלימנה — he pays for the difference after the owner deducts the value of the carcass]. According to the plain meaning: He should pay minimally, according to the animal’s value; for besides the differences in the animal’s skill or work, there is also an evaluation based on its lineage — someone who had the horse upon whom the king rode … he is obligated to pay only its minimum worth.

<b>And proclaim freedom in the land.</b> This includes the soldiers of war who leave their homes to guard in the service of the king and the matters of state; in the Jubilee year they return to their homes and ancestral land.
 <b>It shall be for you a jubilee.</b> According to the plain meaning the word יובל connotes moving (הובלה) from one place to another. In fact, the deer is also called יובל because it is always going from place to place. The Torah continues and explains the reason for the jubilee year: 
<b>And each man shall return to his ancestral land</b> — even if he has no ancestral land he goes back to his main family and all the family heads are gathered together.

<b>If you shall say.</b> In truth all this is nothing but miraculous — in a year without any planting, the grain and fruit of the trees will grow enough to satiate the entire population of people and animals. It is known that path of miracles is only appropriate to the extent that one prepares for it, and this is what it says previously in Scripture: “You shall fulfill My statutes, etc.” This means they should increase their continuous study of Torah and its sharp give and take in those years. They should believe and completely give themselves over to this lofty manner of conducting themselves … Thus, one might think the main mitzvah of the Sabbatical and Jubilee year was only given to those who conduct themselves with this extra high level. However, this is not true, for the Torah can be kept completely even by people who are not on this level. This is why Scripture explains, “If you will say …” — if you will not be on this level, then “I will command” — this is personal Hashgachah in the way of nature.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>You shall grant redemption to the land.</b> Even if it is already sold to non-Jews it is a mitzvah to redeem it so that it will not be worked in the Sabbatical year … Even regarding our day and age it says in Gittin (8b) that for the sake of settling Eretz Yisrael it is a mitzvah to redeem a field from a non-Jew, and so much the more so when the people of Israel are dwelling in Eretz Yisrael. It says, “In all of your ancestral lands” — there is only a mitzvah when all of Eretz Yisrael is in the possession of the people of Israel. This is not so if all of Eretz Yisrael is in the hands of non-Jews, and it is impossible to redeem it all; there is no mitzvah to redeem a certain location. This is the plain meaning of Scripture, and you may derive from it the <i>drashot</i> as well.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>[Or] if the man has no redeemer.</b> This is extra, and it comes to teach about the way of ethical discipline. The one who has no redeemer will achieve the means to redeem his land, for the one who has a redeemer upon whom he relies removes his trust from Hashem. This is not the case if someone has no one else to rely on; such a person finds shelter only with Hashem. It says here, “man,” which teaches that even one who trusts in Hashem must nonetheless be a “man,” one who recognizes his Creator and makes every effort in prayer and supplication from Hashem, Blessed be He.

<b>Who brought you out.</b> This is the reason for the warning to the borrower not to give interest, for what can be done when he needs to borrow money and cannot find any without giving interest? Therefore it gives the reason, “I brought you out from the land of Egypt” — and they were provided for in abundance like the king’s hand, if so, I shall watch over you and bring you your livelihood.

Verse 43

<b>You must not rule over him to crush him.</b> Giving him work he is not capable of performing has no use for the master and is only to crush him so that he will not consider himself a free man, and this is prohibited with a Hebrew servant.

Verse 44

<b>From them you may purchase.</b> It is a mitzvah to purchase them to take them out of idolatry.

Verse 45



Verse 46

<b>You must not rule over him to crush him.</b> On the contrary, you should be generous with him and tell him, “Maybe Hashem will help you and provide you with a redeemer, or you will gain the funds in some other way, through Divine Providence”.

Verse 47



Verse 48

<b>After he is sold.</b> This teaches that at first he should try not to be sold, but if he is sold, then nonetheless, “redemption shall be his.” In Toras Kohanim the Baraita taught the opposite: “If he came and said: ‘I am about to be sold,’ we might have thought we have to help him, therefore the Torah says, ‘after he is sold.’” That is, if he comes to his relatives and says, “If you do not help me I will sell myself to a foreigner,” and he will be a disgrace to the family … Nevertheless, what I wrote is true, and it is implied by the verse’s plain meaning that if they know he is poor and is prepared to sell himself, in truth they should make an effort that he will not come to this.

<b>Thereby breaking My covenant.</b> This includes two connotations: One is the covenant that the people of Israel made with Hashem to be His nation, to keep the Torah and mitzvos. They would break this covenant solely due to their desires. It also includes breaking another covenant which Hashem made with the people of Israel to watch over them. Because they wanted to throw off the yoke of Torah and mitzvos, they increased in rebelliousness and did things to anger Hashem, disgusting things of which they were in truth not worthy. They only did them so He would remove His Divine Presence from the Holy Land and from the people of Israel. They thought that if Hashem would remove His Divine Presence from them they could be like all the other nations and all the other lands, under the guidance of the celestial kingdom, which is the sun. The Torah numbers seven transgressions: 1) Agreement not to do for the sake of Hashem. 2) Not to do at all. 3) Despising one who does according to the ways of tradition. 4) Despising the study of Torah in general. 5) Trying to prevent anyone from doing according to the Torah. 6) Trying to cast off the entire yoke of Heaven’s kingship. 7) Doing deeds to anger Hashem so that Hashem will break His covenant with us.

Instead, you will be despised because they will see you pursuing one another.

<b>If it is of an unclean animal he shall redeem it.</b> This is speaking about one who consecrates a first-born ritually unclean animal, which is not a first-born donkey, because their custom was to consecrate the firstling to Heaven so they would have success with the future offspring. As a matter of course we learn that the same law applies for someone who consecrates a ritually unclean animal that is not a first-born. It needs to be understood why the verse uses the language ופדה (he shall redeem) and not וגאל like the rest of the <i>parshah</i>, and in this very verse it says, “If it is not redeemed (יגאל).” It seems that the answer is because the implication of ופדה is for its worth, and וגאל connotes any amount.
