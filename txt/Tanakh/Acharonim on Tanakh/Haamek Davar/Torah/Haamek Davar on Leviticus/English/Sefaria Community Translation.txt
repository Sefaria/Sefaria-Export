Verse 33

<b>You shall not go out for seven days -</b> That is during the time of offering the sacrifices of the inauguration. As behold, afterwards they dismantled the tabernacle, as it is explained in the Yerushalmi, Yoma, Chapter 1 (Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 1:1:14): From where [do we know about] the dismantlings? Rebbi Zeira said, "'It was on the day that Moses stopped erecting the tabernacle' (Numbers 7:1) - on the day the erections stopped." 
<b>because for seven days your hands will be filled - </b> Scripture explained a reason for this commandment. As behold, it is not similar to that which Moshe warned (forbade) on the eighth day (Leviticus 10:7), "From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not go out, etc." For then the service was incumbent upon the priests, which was not the case during these seven days, when the service was incumbent upon Moshe. For that reason, it gave the reason that they would fill their hands on the seven days, the understanding of which is to study and train the hands with care. For this reason, it warned them to stay and watch Moshe's actions these seven days.

Verse 1




<b>a strange fire, which He had not commanded them:</b> The language is not precise. As behold, it was forbidden to bring a strange fire. So how is it fit to say, "which He had not commanded" - as it implies that they were also not prohibited about it. And see what the Baal HaTurim wrote; and the homiletical approach mentioned in the Herchav Devar, that they came in with the fire of enthusiasm of the love of God. Whereas the Torah said that even though the love of God is precious in the eyes of God, it is not so when it is in this fashion that was not commanded, and as I wrote above in the name of the Torat Kohanim on the verse, "And Moshe said, 'This is the thing, etc.'" (Leviticus 9:6).

<b>And atone for it:</b> And it is taught in Torat Kohanim, "Atonement, which is for itself." The understanding is that it is not like the atonement that is on the curtain, such that he first atoned on the holy itself, as I have written, and afterward atoned for the Jewish people. But this atonement of the altar is only to atone upon it itself and not upon the iniquity of the Jewish people. And that is why the verse concludes, <b> and he shall take from the blood of the bull and from the blood of the goat, etc.</b> — in a mixture, and not like that with the curtain. And that is, that since it does not come for the atonement of the Jewish people but only for the altar by itself, it is fine to mix the blood of the bull that comes for the priests together with the blood of the goat that comes for the Jewish people. And also resolved with this is that which the verse had, <i>and atone for it</i>, before the act, which is not like the way of Scripture in every [other] place.

"So that they should know, etc." (Lev 23:43) In order that they will not despair from the good life since they do not have a holding of the inheritance or natural happiness. In any case, "they would know" from the mitzvah of Sukkah that it was given [to them] to remember their dwelling in Sukkot when [God] brought them out [of Egypt] (cf Lev 23:43)... And behold, "I am the Lord Your God" (Lev 23:43): Your Leader and Protector forever and there is nothing blocking from the One who is Blessed to bestow goodness and blessing even from those who don't hold an inheritance. And it is also important to understand the language of "the citizen."
