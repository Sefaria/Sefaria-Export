<b>You shall not go out for seven days -</b> That is during the time of offering the sacrifices of the inauguration. As behold, afterwards they dismantled the tabernacle, as it is explained in the Yerushalmi, Yoma, Chapter 1 (Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 1:1:14): From where [do we know about] the dismantlings? Rebbi Zeira said, "'It was on the day that Moses stopped erecting the tabernacle' (Numbers 7:1) - on the day the erections stopped." 
<b>because for seven days your hands will be filled - </b> Scripture explained a reason for this commandment. As behold, it is not similar to that which Moshe warned (forbade) on the eighth day (Leviticus 10:7), "From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not go out, etc." For then the service was incumbent upon the priests, which was not the case during these seven days, when the service was incumbent upon Moshe. For that reason, it gave the reason that they would fill their hands on the seven days, the understanding of which is to study and train the hands with care. For this reason, it warned them to stay and watch Moshe's actions these seven days.

"So that they should know, etc." (Lev 23:43) In order that they will not despair from the good life since they do not have a holding of the inheritance or natural happiness. In any case, "they would know" from the mitzvah of Sukkah that it was given [to them] to remember their dwelling in Sukkot when [God] brought them out [of Egypt] (cf Lev 23:43)... And behold, "I am the Lord Your God" (Lev 23:43): Your Leader and Protector forever and there is nothing blocking from the One who is Blessed to bestow goodness and blessing even from those who don't hold an inheritance. And it is also important to understand the language of "the citizen."
