<b>And Pharaoh charged (vayitsav):</b> It is written, vayitsav, here, which is an expression of exhortation. And it is explained at the beginning of Parshat Tsav (Leviticus 6:2) that exhortation is whatever is required to be diligent about a matter so that it will be done in its totality. And [it was] since this decree was not similar to the prohibition to the midwives - as there it was easy to fulfill the decree, since it is impossible to give birth without a midwife; which was not the case with this prohibition. For it was possible to hide it from him, as they told him that the Israelite women were vigorous and [able] to give birth without a midwife. And those appointed over it could have also dealt with it weakly and said that they did not know about this boy. For this reason Pharaoh [decreed it] with an exhortation, that they diligent about the matter, so as to fulfill the decree in its totality.

<b>and every daughter:</b> Whether they were already born or whether they be born from now, let them live - [meaning,] make efforts to keep them alive. And his intention with this was that since the daughters would be so more numerous than the males, they would per force marry Egyptians. And he saw to deal well with his land through this; as the Israelite women were vigorous, and he reasoned that this is what caused the proliferation of the people of Israel. So if they would marry Egyptians, they too would proliferate and increase.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

And a man from the house of Levi went - as it was stated that the man was from Levi and he took a woman from Levi, and it is clear that she was older than him by many years, and it is not common that a man marries a woman older than him. And this happened just because they were both from the house of Levi, and they behaved with piety, they saw secrets that were hidden from the eyes of that generation, and that is why he took her. That is why it is written "he went", it was a surprising thing, and it was done outside the normal human behavior.

<b>His elite officers:</b> who rode with power on armored horses, which had the ability to swim and exit the sea. As the place of their descent was not so wide and deep that a good horse could not swim [out of it]. However they drowned in the Reed Sea, a place of reeds and swamps. It was with individualized providence that the horses went into the place of the reeds and could not exit.

Verse 5

<b>The depths covered them:</b> There are some of them that could not exit for that reason, that the depths rose above the head of the horse and covered it, such that it could not raise its head and swim.
<b>they sank into the shadowy depths like stone:</b> The light horse and his rider sunk like stone with individualized providence, such that it could not exit. This was without any apparent cause as to why this happened. Rather, the Lord is His name, He can do anything.

<i>Thin uncovered matter, thin like frost:</i> It is fitting to know that one should wonder about the picking up of the manna - as there descended an <i>omer</i> quantity for an adult and [also] an <i>omer</i> for a child of three - how is it possible that their eating would be the same? And if we say that this too is miraculous, that the child should eat like the adult - if so, how does the bareita in Eruvin 83b prove that the measurement of a meal is an <i>omer</i> - and is it not that here it was not like the way of eating other things? And also there is an objection [from] the expression later, "a man according to his eating" - which implies that according to his ability did it descend, [according to] how [much] he needed, if it were little or much; and [yet] behold, the same [amount] descended for everyone. But rather the answer for all of this is that the manna 'was like a <i>gad</i> seed' - which is a flax seed - the crust of which is above, and within it, it is full of granules. And like this did the manna descend, but some of them were empty and only the very thin upper crust was eaten. And this is what was said, "thin uncovered matter (<i>mechuspas</i>)" - that the thin crust was like a box and like the expression, "<i>chafisa</i> (small container)," like the explanation of Rashi. And some of them are "thin like frost," which is empty inside and it is possible to make with much frost one handful. And it was through providence that there descended for each one according to his eating; and [so] for the child they were completely empty. Yet according to the size of the picking, there was an <i>omer</i> for everyone. And [so] it [comes out] fine that the gemara proves [the amount of a meal] from that the measurement was an <i>omer</i>, and [even] for the most, there was only this measurement; we understand from this that this was the measurement required for an average man [for a meal].

One to another. This is to teach regarding strong love, like the groom when he sees the bride, and enjoys just looking at her.
Toward the ark-cover. To teach us that the vision of the Holy One and Israel, together, is toward the Torah in the ark, and this is what explains [the saying that] the Holy One, and Israel, and the Torah are one, as it is known.

 I have also granted skill to all who are skillful: In Brachot 55 they (the sages) said that the Holy One Blessed be God only gave wisdom to those who had wisdom. (The Gemara asks) What is the basis for this? And thus the explanation is given that it is from Sefer Daniel (2:21) " “He gives wisdom unto the wise..." And the intention in this is that the root of wisdom is explained by two teachings/manners:1) logic and discernment 2) Learning and researching what others have already learned. And this is the explanation of the verse in Proverbs (4:7) The beginning of wisdom is—acquire wisdom; With all your acquisitions, acquire discernment. First comes the logical reasoning of the human as he behaves with learning - that he must first gain wisdom of others and afterwards he will be able to acquire wisdom learning one thing from another on his own intuition. ...

"And God had mercy" - from performing the total annihilation. But from that point there was a decree to destroy that generation, and the children would enter the Land of Israel, like there was the decree of the spies. And regarding this decree Moshe prayed for forty more days, as explained later with the help of Heaven.

<b>And the Festival of the Harvest at the turn of the year:</b> In truth, it should have [written], "the Festival of Booths," about the seventh year. For behold, there is no harvest [then]! But it is [nevertheless] written, "the Festival of the Harvest," because of the turn [of the year] that is written here - as it is found in Sanhedrin 14, that the [new] season comes specifically during the intermediate days of the festival, when it is possible to nevertheless harvest what will be lost. And all of this is after the occurrence of the [golden] calf. For before the story of the calf, these two festivals only came because it is the nature of a state to celebrate the time of reaping and the time of harvest. So Scripture only came to warn them, that they should be festival[s] for the Lord. But if people did not want a holiday, it is not clear if the law would be to make a holiday at all for the sake of the commandment. And, if so, these holidays would not occur on the seventh year. But after the calf, He warned them to do the Festivals even on the seventh year, in order that they would come to the [Temple] courtyard to internalize service [to God] and faith.
