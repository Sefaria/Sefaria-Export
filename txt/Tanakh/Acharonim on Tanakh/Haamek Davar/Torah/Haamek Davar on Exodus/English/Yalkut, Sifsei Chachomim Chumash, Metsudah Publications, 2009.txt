Verse 22

<b>Yisrael is My son, My firstborn.</b> All the nations of the world are part of the purpose of creation. Even if they practice idolatry, nevertheless, there are pious gentiles in every generation who recognize the honor of Hashem. However, Yisrael is compared to the first born son of a king that inherits the crown; moreover, even during the lifetime of the king he assists in ruling the kingdom. In the same way, Yisrael assists Divine Providence and the running of the world.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6



Verse 1



Verse 2



<b>I am Adonoy.</b> This teaches that the entire world is perpetuated by Hashem, utilizing Divine Providence. In contradistinction to a house, for example, that once it has been built the builder ceases work and it stands on its own, the world continues to exist only because Hashem keeps it in existence. With this, Hashem answered Moshe’s question in which he implied that Pharaoh’s decree was merely a result of natural events without Hashem’s Providence; Hashem replied that nature is also a result of Divine Providence.

Verse 3



Verse 4


<b>The land of their sojourning.</b> I promised them the Land because it is the land of their sojourning and they have become accustomed to Divine Providence in it, and not solely because it is a land of milk and honey. Hashem looks after the Land in detail, making it the place of abundant Providence. I promised this to their sons, for it is My Will to watch over them.

Verse 26

<b>This is [the lineage of] Aharon and Moshe.</b> According to the simple meaning, [Aharon appears in the verse before Moshe because] the B’nei Yisrael had more respect for Aharon than Moshe, for they never knew the greatness of Moshe, who was raised in the royal palace and fled to Midian, but they knew of Aharon’s holiness.

Verse 27

<b>These are Moshe and Aharon.</b> In Pharaoh’s view Moshe was the greater one, for he already knew of his reputation and his wisdom, but Aharon was unknown to him.

<b>And there were lice.</b> The Torah repeats these words (from v.13) to inform that they settled on the bodies of people and animals and bit them in the manner of lice, which do not swarm but are attached to the body. This is implied by the Midrash Tanchuma: “They entered the Egyptians’ bodies like arrows”.

<b>And your little ones.</b> Pharaoh asked, “Who is going to provide for your needs in the desert? Will you not die of hunger?” This is the significance of his warning, “for evil confronts you.” That is, you are seeking your own misfortune by taking your little ones into the barren desert.

<b>What is this service.</b> The Pesach sacrifice is singled out for the scoffer’s derision because it serves no practical purpose, unlike other sacrifices which at least serve as appeasement or atonement. And if it is to serve as an expression of gratitude for the redemption it should not have been made to coincide specifically with the striking of the first born, for in no other instance are we commanded to commemorate miracles. The only exceptions are the festivals of Chanukah and Purim and even in those cases the intention of the Sages was to call to mind the deeper concepts connected with the miracles, not the miracles themselves.

<b>To Sukkos. There were about six hundred thousand.</b> They departed Ramseis in such confusion and haste that there was no time to conduct a count. Therefore only when they came to Sukkos was their number known.
<b>Besides the children.</b> The word <i>taf</i> actually includes women and the elderly as well as children. It is derived from the word <i>tafel</i>, meaning “ancillary”.

<b>A vigil (or “Stored up”) … for all the B’nei Yisrael.</b> Because this was the time of Yisrael’s first redemption it was “stored up” for them for all generations as an auspicious time for deliverance from every type of affliction.

<b>The Egyptians pursued.</b> This refers to the Egyptian masses.
<b>After them.</b> That is, they followed after Pharaoh and his troops. When the Egyptian populace realized that B’nei Yisrael did not intend on returning, they too set out to recover their property. 
<b>And overtook them.</b> The Egyptian masses overtook Pharaoh’s chariots and cavalry.

<b>At (or “above”) Pi haChiros.</b> The B’nei Yisrael camped <i>before</i> Pi haChiros (v. 2) while the Egyptians camped <i>above</i> Pi haChiros.

From this they would infer that no one else would ever attain to his level, consequently the Torah received by him would never be replaced.

<b>Before the Presence of the Master.</b> Hashem is only referred to by this title in two places, here and in a similar context further on (34:23). It is a hint to those who are reluctant to leave their homes to make the pilgrimage that their continued prosperity is dependent upon receiving the blessing of the Master of the land during the festival.

<b>And Moshe came into the midst of the cloud.</b> According to one view in <i>Yoma</i> This means that Moshe did not ascend on foot but merely entered into the cloud and was transported by it to the summit of the mountain.

Chapter 25



Chapter 26



Chapter 27



Chapter 28



Verse 1


<b>And his sons with him.</b> The expression “with him” implies that they only merited the priesthood through being Aharon’s sons. This was the error of Nadav and Avihu when they offered the strange fire before God (Vayikra 10:1)—they thought they were worthy of performing the service on account of their own personal greatness.

Verse 2

<b>For honor and splendor.</b> This is only said about the garments of the <i>high priest</i>. Aharon was required to act with special piety and to set himself apart from the people, which was liable to bring upon him an accusation of haughtiness. Therefore it was necessary that he be distinguished in his dress so that all would know that God had chosen him to be the “Throne” of the <i>Shechinah</i>. Likewise is with all high priests. Whereas with the garments of the ordinary priests, only the turbans were for honor and glory, as I have written further on verse 40. However the high priest was fit to be differentiated in all of his ways.

Verse 3


<b>Wise in heart.</b> Wisdom is usually associated with the head. “Wise in heart” refers specifically to the possession of awe of God, which is the beginning of true wisdom (Tehillim 111:10). The seat of awe is indeed in the heart.

Verse 12

<b>As a remembrance.</b> In Tehillim (115:12) it is written, “Ad-noy has remembered us; He will bless.” This teaches us that when God “remembers” the B’nei Yisrael it is in order to bless them.

Verse 42

<b>Linen pants.</b> These pants were of lesser sanctity than the other garments. The other garments imparted holiness to the wearer; the pants merely concealed their private parts. The <i>kohanim</i> were dressed for the first time in their other garments by Moshe; the pants they donned themselves. The other garments were donned in the courtyard; the pants were put on outside the Holy Temple.

Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>See, I have called.</b> “See” in this context is a call to caution. The fact that the <i>mishkon</i> could only be fashioned by one whom God had imbued with Divine spirit, wisdom, understanding and knowledge, was an indication of its loftiness. Therefore it was fitting for them to behave towards it with special care.

<b>Whoever is for Ad-noy [come] to me.</b> Moshe could not have been referring to everyone who did not worship the calf, for that would have included the majority of the people. Rather, he was calling upon those whose intentions were pure and who would give all they owned for God’s honor.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30


<b>You have committed a great sin (<i>cheit</i>).</b> A <i>cheit</i> is an inadvertent sin. Moshe rebuked them no further concerning their idolatry and rebellion because three thousand of them had already been executed and many more died after drinking the water mixed with the dust of the calf. Instead he chastised them only for the unintended offense of desecrating the name of Heaven.
<b>Now I will go up to Ad-noy.</b> Moshe knew that the <i>Shechinah</i> was still present on the mountaintop because it was still burning with fire. Therefore he realized that that would be the best place to pray since the Tent of Meeting had not yet been established (see v. 33:7).

Chapter 33

Verse 4

<b>They mourned.</b> Even though a child does not wish to listen to his mother’s admonishments, the moment she attempts to leave him he begins to cry. He is willing to endure even chastisement if she will only continue to watch out for him. Similarly, although the B’nei Yisrael were punished many times in the desert, they were dismayed when God threatened to take His <i>Shechinah</i> away.  
<b>And no man wore his ornaments.</b> All who were worthy of receiving the spirit of prophecy realized that this was not the time to seek it.

<b>I will cause all My goodness to pass.</b> This refers to the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. God revealed to Moshe that the moment of their proclamation would be an auspicious time to make requests of Him. <b>And will proclaim the Name, Ad-noy.</b> The Thirteen Attributes were to be preceded by the Divine name (see v. 6). <b>I will be gracious … I will be compassionate.</b> At that time God would bestow His graciousness upon those whom He deemed worthy, regardless of whether they had requested it and He would have compassion on those who sought His compassion.

<b>All that opens the womb.</b> These laws were discussed earlier in ch. 13. They are repeated here lest one suppose that the first-born ceased to be holy once the Levites were chosen in their stead, for the purpose of their election was to produce a corps of individuals dedicated to Torah study and Divine service, a role subsequently fulfilled by the Levites.

<b>All those who are wise in heart.</b> This included not only scholars but all who feared Heaven. If they would come to participate in the making of the Tabernacle, Hashem would assist them even if they had never learned a skilled craft prior to this.
