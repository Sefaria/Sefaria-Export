<b>I took from you.</b> Since the stated purposed was to spy out how to conquer the land, it would have been better to hire non-Jewish spies who were experts in war and conquest… However Moshe Rabbeinu knew that by the laws of nature it would be difficult to conquer, without strength of faith and trust in Hashem, along with a desire to inherit the good land. This would have been impossible for foreigners to understand, so the spies had to be “from you.”… He also thought that the spies would become strengthened and hearty from their expedition, like Calev when he entered Chevron, and through this they would know that they would succeed in conquering the land.

<b>He will wage war for you.</b> Hashem’s intent was not that the Canaanites should be smitten by plague before they arrived to wage war, but that He would help the Jews while they were fighting against them.  
<b>As in everything that He did with you.</b> With the Egyptians — Hashem did not destroy them beforehand but waged war against them at the Red Sea. This was His Will and His Honor, and similarly in the war against the Canaanites.

<b>This wicked generation.</b> There were many people in that generation who said that Hashem was unable to do this, or that they did not want Hashem’s providence. And the righteous are punished along with the wicked, and when Hashem is angry He punishes even for light sins.

<b>Hashem, Elokim.</b> These two names control the world. The four letter name gives existence to everything, including all the forces of nature. The name Hashem controls those forces, like a master who does what he wishes with his property. Moshe asked that he should be permitted to enter the land of Israel through whichever attribute is appropriate. If he does not merit to enter with the attribute of splendor, which is personified by Moshe in the desert, let it be through the laws of nature, as he began in the fortieth year… This is the power of prayer, to mention the specific name appropriate to that which is being asked for.
<b>Your greatness.</b> This is the greatness of nature.
<b>And Your powerful hand.</b> This controls nature. This is by way of analogy. Just as one who holds a turbine which is turned by water power, or fire, has the ability to stop the turbine. This is the meaning of “hand.” This is the miraculous power which holds the spheres of nature which turn with strength.  
<b>That can perform Your deeds.</b> This refers to the laws of nature, which are written many times in the account of creation using the language of “performing.” 
<b>And Your acts of power.</b> This is Hashem’s ability to grasp with great power the spheres of nature and to change them, as we have said.

<b>Hashem addressed you</b>. Later (Devarim 10:4) with regard to the first set of Ten Commandments, which says, “Remember the day of Shabbos” the verse states, “That Hashem addressed to you,” whereas with regard to the second tablets which say “Preserve the day of Shabbos,” (Devarim 5:12) it states, “that Hashem addressed you.” This is because all of Yisroel heard “Remember” but only Moshe heard “Preserve” and the rest of Yisroel did not. They heard other sounds apart from the words that they heard. The amazing fact that Moshe is describing here, “Hashem addressed you” meaning that you heard the sounds of speech but not words. 
<b>Solely sound.</b> Another amazing fact was that you saw nothing but the image of the sound, meaning that the people saw pictures in the shapes of letters through the tongues of fire.

<b>From the sky.</b> Hashem gave two proofs to know this. Firstly, “From the sky” this shows the level of prophecy and they heard it themselves… First “He made Hisi voice audible to you to afflict you” that it is almost impossible to attain the level of prophecy without afflicting the body… And afterwards, “You heard His words” and after the power of prophecy there is no more room for doubt, and you do not need philosophical investigation.

Verse 1

<b>The entire <i>mitzvah</i> … you are to guard so as to fulfill. </b>To teach that even when the Jewish people had not reached the ability to perform all the <i>mitzvos</i>, as when they first entered the land of Israel and there will still some <i>mitzvos</i> in which they were not obligated until after they had inherited, divided and settled the land, nevertheless, Hashem commanded them to learn all the <i>mitzvos</i>, so that when they have the ability to perform them they will be able to do so properly. From here we also learn that during the exile we must learn how to act once we are redeemed from that exile.

<b>To ultimately benefit you.</b> This does not mean “that it will be good for you ultimately” for if so, it should have said, “To give benefit to you.” Rather it means “to make you good.” This test was similar to the test of the flax which I wrote about earlier, and is in order to accustom you to trust in Hashem, even until your final moment. And it is clear from this that Hashem watches over everything that happens every single moment.

Verse 4

Moshe warned them excessively to remove two mistaken ideas from their minds. 1. Do not trust yourselves that you will not stumble and sin with idolatry. This is the warning of the Sages, “Do not trust in yourselves” (Avos 2:4). This belief itself and lead a person to be careless with things close to idolatry which can cause him to stumble and lead him to sin… 2. They should not rely on Hashem that He will not destroy the land and lay it waste under any circumstances, even if they worship idols. Do not think that Hashem desires that the Jewish people should live in the land of Israel… and He trusts me that I will not sin. 
<b>Because of the wickedness of these nations.</b> Do not think that Hashem so greatly desires that the Land be settled, that despite all of the wickedness of the nations until now, He did not expel them from the land and leave the land of Israel desolate… Do not think that even if you sin with idolatry, Hashem will not find another nation better than you. For this reason Moshe warned them that both of these ideas are mistaken.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>In Choreiv you angered Hashem.</b> Moshe went on at length to refute two false ideas. The first is that you are certain that you will not worship idols. Even at Choreiv, that special occasion, you angered Hashem. Secondly you believe that even if you do worship idols you will not be exiled. But “Hashem was infuriated with you to destroy you,” even though since the beginning of creation He loved you… Moshe went on at length to show that there is nothing which prevents the judgment of Hashem’s attribute of strict justice.

I did not tilt my hand and let them fall by themselves, but rather I grasped them and threw them. This was miraculous, for they were placed on his two hands, such that it was impossible for Moshe to grasp them and throw them. He received Divine help for this, which shows that even Hashem had no mercy for these holy tablets.

<b>To its wickeness.</b> At the Golden Calf there were two sins. 1. Those wicked people who intended to worship idols. 2. The entire generation who took the gold rings and helped to build the Calf which caused the trouble. Even though most of the people did not intend to worship idols, as we have explained, nevertheless they profaned Hashem’s name, for which one is punished even for unintentional sin. This explains the repetition here “To its wickedness and to its sin.” 

Verse 28

<b>Because of Hashem’s inability.</b> Moshe changed the words here, from what he said at Mount Sinai. There he said, “Why should Egypt be able to say, “He brought them out with evil intent to kill them in the mountains’” (Shemos 32:12). Moshe said that when Hashem was planning on entirely destroying the Jewish people, and the concern was the others would say that Hashem brought them out of Egypt to destroy them, not to make them His people. However, here, once Hashem had reconsidered, and there was no longer concern that He would destroy the entire nation, Moshe said that the nations would think that Hashem was unable to bring them into the land of Israel, and only wanted to bring them to the desert so that their children could dwell there.

Verse 18

<b>And grant you mercy.</b> The actions of the idolatrous city lead to three evils amongst Yisroel: 1. Anyone who kills another becomes cruel by nature. The court appoints a special agent to execute an individual who is liable to the death penalty. But a complete city will certainly create people who are murderers and cruel. 2. Everyone in that city will have had relatives in other cities, and it will increase hatred amongst the Jews. 3. It shrinks the Jewish population and leaves areas uninhabited. Therefore the Torah promises that all who perform the mitzvah of executing this city, without gaining any benefit from the spoils, will remove Hashem’s anger, and will bring Hashem’s attribute of mercy.

Chapter 14



Verse 1

<b>You are children:</b> It is clear that this is an introduction and that the reason for the prohibition is after it. But it is difficult - if it is the reason, why did the Torah write another reason, "since you are a holy nation"... In the warning against lacerating yourselves there are two distinct meanings, as explained in Yevamot (13b): Do not lacerate your flesh in mourning for the deceased, and do not make separate groups. This is not an allusion, but the meaning of the text … including within this warning is that you should not have two Beit Din courts in a single city. For this reason the verse first gave the explanation that you are sons of Hashem, and since you are sons of Hashem it is not appropriate that you appear as different groups in the customs of your Torah, because the nature of children is to follow the same path.

Verse 2

<b>For you are a sacred people to Hashem, your God.</b> The verse gives two reasons for the prohibition of lacerating with a utensil or making a bald spot with your hand as a sign of mourning. 1. Because you are sacred people to Hashem, meaning separate and elevated. Therefore you must know that every pain or difficult event that happens to you is the will of Hashem, or to atone for sin, which is also part of the Glory of Hashem and His will. One who is set aside for service of Hashem should set aside his personal pain for the will of Hashem. However, crying and mourning according to the appropriate measures that the Torah gave is the will of Hashem, to give honor to the deceased, to the extent that the honor of the deceased overrides all the <i>mitzvos</i> in the Torah. But acting in a way which leaves a lasting mark after the time that the Torah gave for mourning is not honor for the deceased, but simply an expression of grief. It is not appropriate for those who are sacred to Hashem to act in this way. 2. <b>Hashem chose you. </b>You should gather all those who come to worship Hashem from the other nations. If so, it would not be giving glory to Hashem before the other nations of the world if His chosen people were lacerated or bald.

Verse 23

<b>Your grain, your wine.</b> First we must explain the end of the verse, “In order that you learn to fear Hashem…” It is taught in <i>Sifrei</i>: The mitzvah of <i>maaser sheini </i>was only given in order that you will learn to fear Hashem. The explanation is that <i>maaser sheini</i> may only be eaten in Yerushalayim, and it is impossible for the owners to eat all of the tithes in the short time that they are there for the festivals. Therefore the owner must remain on his own in Yerushalayim after the festival, when he has nothing to do but to learn to fear Hashem, or he must leave the food to students in Yerushalayim, which is the purpose of <i>maaser sheini</i>, to increase Torah study. So this verse is speaking not about during the days of the festival, but all the other days of the year.

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>And for anything that you wish.</b> Every kind of pleasurable food that is possible to purchase with money, and you do not need to save your money to give to students after the festival.

Verse 7

<b>Among your brothers.</b> The distinguished among your brothers, meaning a worthy poor person, who does not go collecting door to door, but someone who is important, but has lost his money.  


<b>Do not close your hand.</b> This refers to one of your brothers. The nature of Yisroel is to be merciful, and to take pity on someone who is suffering. However it is also human nature to take pity on one’s own money, and to close up one’s merciful heart.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10


<b>As a consequence of this thing.</b> That you give generously, and as a result the poor person will bless you, which has a great effect, as explained in <i>Midrash Rus</i>, that more than the rich person gives to the poor, the poor does for the rich, meaning that he blesses him. 
<b>In all your work. </b>Whether in the field, or in creative activity.  
<b>And in all your commerce. </b>In all your business dealings.

Verse 2

<b>Separate three cities for yourself.</b> Do not think that it would be better to place the cities of refuge in another kingdom, where the residents would be safer from the relatives of the deceased, who will not be able to cross the border without permission from the ruler of that land. This is not the case, but rather the cities must specifically be within your land.

<b>Wayward and rebellious son.</b> The continuation of the verse explains what this means, “He does not obey his father or his mother.” In Mishlei the verse states, “Hear, my son, the instruction of your father, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother” (Mishlei 1:8). This means that the father teaches his son the Torah of Hashem, which is called “instruction” whereas the mother teaches correct behavior and customs, which is the “teaching of the mother.” The son who does not listen to the Torah of his father is called “wayward” and if he does not listen to the teachings of his mother he is called “rebellious.” In other words, this son does not follow in the path of Torah nor of correct behavior.

Verse 17

<b>Remember.</b> When a person sins, he comes to sin in one of three ways. Either due to a lack of faith in Hashem and His Torah, or because his desires get the better of him, or because his anger, or other evil interpersonal attributes overpower him. The chief sin showing lack of faith in Hashem is idolatry. The chief sin of desire is sexual immorality, and the chief sin of evil attributes is murder. Every sin is due to one of these three. For example, one who breaks Shabbos to earn a livelihood shows lack of faith, which is related to idolatry. If he breaks Shabbos in order to fulfil his desires, it is related to sexual immorality. The worst of the three is idolatry, since it demonstrates a lack of faith and also makes repentance very difficult. Someone who steals a valuable item from another may have done so due to his desire for that item, which is related to sexual immorality. However, one who has false weights and measures does not do so due to desire, but because of a lack of faith in Hashem, Who provides everyone with what they need with individual providence to every creature. This is related to idolatry. Therefore the Sages have said: The sin of false weights, even though it is only a subcategory of idolatry, and very far from the chief sin of denial of Hashem, nevertheless, it is more serious than sexual immorality, which is the chief sin of desire. It is much more difficult to repent from a lack of faith, and it is directly related to Hashem’s honor. Since this is the case, we now return to the topic of Amalek… Amalek came as a result of the doubt of the people as to whether Hashem was in their midst or not, through nature. They were concerned that when Moshe died there would be no more miracles. This lack of faith brought Amalek, and is therefore due to “the sin of weights”.

Verse 6

<b>Treated us badly.</b> The text should say that they acted badly towards us. Rather the Egyptians made us into the wicked ones, who lacked gratitude. They suspected that we would side with their enemies, which had never entered the minds of the Jewish people.  
<b>And oppressed us.</b> They forced us to perform labor that brought them no benefit, but purely for the purpose of afflicting us.

Verse 7

<b>Hashem accepted our prayer.</b> They merited to have their prayers accepted even though they had no words, but simply cried out from the depths of their hearts.  
<b>And perceived our oppression.</b> Even those things about which we were embarrassed to cry out, such as preventing marital intimacy.  
<b>And our labor.</b> This refers to the children who were thrown into the river eighty years earlier, which they had already forgotten to cry out about.  
<b>And the pressure.</b> This is the confinement, for Pharaoh confined the people to live in small homes. All of this caused the people to be depressed and to lack hope, to remove the ambition and pride of the Jewish people. Pharaoh did all of this to humiliate the people. One who has spent his whole life suffering like this does not realize the evil that has been done to him, and he thinks that it is natural that he is depressed and weak. But Hashem sees and proves the truth.

<b>To obey Him.</b> This refers to the in depth study and toil in Torah.
<b>To cling to Him: </b>One who is unable to learn Torah should at least try to attain the love of Hashem through clinging to Him. This is explained in the Gemara (Kesuvos 111) as referring to one who marries his daughter to a Torah scholar, and helps a Torah scholar financially. The Torah considers this as if he is clinging to the Divine Presence. Through joining with, and helping a Torah scholar, he attains a small part of the love of Hashem.

This is what the verse means, “Your time is approaching to die,” and therefore it is the right time for you to place your spirit onto Yehoshua.

<b>The heritage of the congregation of Yaakov.</b> Like a heritage, which one receives without personal effort. Similarly, the merit of the Torah in which the Torah scholars toil, is a heritage to the congregation of Yaakov, who are the masses of the Jewish people. For the true in depth study is impossible unless one is without any financial worries, and in this way those who support it receive their reward.
