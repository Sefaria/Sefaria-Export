... And [Moshe] said that this thing caused God to get angry with him at the end of forty years (with the rock). For his main sin was that he did not show Israel how to fulfill their needs in a natural way... And all of this began with the story of the spies in that they [then first] sought the natural way [of doing things].

"For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the works of your hands." For they had been close in proximity to Edom and the other settled lands, and they would do business with these folks and God caused this trade to be successful. "Knew your travels." As the Seforno translated, this is similar to the language of "and God knew...". Which is to say, God had a hand in your travels specifically. Any time the Torah says "knew", this is positive, as it says in the Sifri in parshat Behaalotcha, God only remembers for a blessing, as it says "God remembered us for good." And "knowing" is similar.

<b>You are to guard (<i>Venishmartem</i>) your lives exceedingly:</b> Included in this expression is a warning about guarding the body. For if it was only guarding the soul, it would have been fitting to write, "Guard (<i>Veshemartem</i>) your lives exceedingly," as [it was written] above (Deuteronomy 4:9), "Guard yourself." Rather, "You are to guard," is [about] the body, as it is found in Berakhot 32b, "Your lives" - to guard the soul, also guard the body.

Verse 4

<b>Hear, Israel.</b> The Ramban of blessed memory examined why the language was changed in this verse, as it is written in Deuteronomy more than in any other portion speaking of the present. It seems that this is in accordance with the interpretation of the Sages in Pesachim 53b, where our ancestor Jacob said this passage, and he said it in this formulation. Then, Moses our master established it with the power of the Torah. Similarly, there are many verses in the Prophets that were known even before that particular Prophet, and the Prophet, with God's permission, established them in his book. Therefore, there were two sections of the Shema and Vehaya Im Shamo'a that were known in Israel even before they arrived in the plains of Moab, as they were already obligated by the Tefillin.
<b>The Lord our God.</b> God implies the one who guides nature and the course of the world. Now, every nation has its leader who guides that nation. However, we also conduct ourselves according to the natural course under the supervision of the Creator who encompasses everything.
<b>The Lord is one.</b> We also have divine providence, which is unique to Israel. As it is stated in the blessings of the Talmud, 'Who performs miracles? The Holy One, blessed be He.' Therefore, He is one in His guidance in this manner.

Verse 5

<b>And you shall love, etc.</b> Love implies two aspects: (1) Sacrificing one's desires and existence for the beloved. (2) Being deeply attached in thought and intense longing for enjoyment with the beloved. These two intentions are hinted at in this verse. (1) As explained by Maimonides, even in a life-threatening situation, one should not transgress any of these three commandments, as it is stated, 'And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,' even if He takes your soul. This entails dedicating everything one possesses for the sake of His honor and faith. (2) As also explained by Maimonides, one is commanded to love the revered and awesome God, as stated, 'And you shall love the Lord.' And how does one go about loving Him? This is further explained in the Jerusalem Talmud, where Rabbi Akiva interprets the verse, 'Your compassion has been with me in my heart; Your compassion has been with me in my soul.' This is similar to a woman who is attached to her child from the womb, indicating the intense attachment in love. The main implications of these two aspects are derived from the previous passage, as one who behaves according to the natural course of the world and has not yet reached the level of piety to find a way of attachment to God. In this case, it is explained that one should at least stand firmly in his faith and not change it in any way, even in times of hardship. This is clarified further. On the other hand, for those who are on a higher spiritual level, they are cautioned in the second aspect to immerse their thoughts in love and attachment at the appropriate time to mention God's name in the Shema and prayer. Therefore, it is written 'You shall love the Lord' and not as it is written 'You shall love your fellow.' The latter implies only leaving one's desire for the other, but 'You shall love the Lord' implies mentioning His name and cleaving to Him. The same applies to the later verse, 'And you shall love the Lord,' which refers to the aspect of fulfilling the commandments with love, as explained there. This is also clarified in this way. Thus, this passage will be further explained in the course that leads to this."

Verse 6

And these words shall be, etc. According to the first approach (in the comment to the above verse) its meaning is that the idea of self-sacrifice in times of hardship should be rooted in our hearts, because one could say that it will not ever come to that, but even so the commandment is to imagine in his heart that if it came to him he would be prepared for it.

Verse 7



Verse 8

And you shall tie them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be for totaphoth between your eyes. It was explained in the Book of Exodus at the end of Parshas Bo (Netziv to Exodus 13:16), that this language's meaning is that the tying of Tefillin is like weapons of war against that which interferes with the guarding of Jewish virtue, in the two aspects of war in which the sword can be effective, as was explained there at length.
And you should write them on the doorposts of your houses. "On" implies that they should be set with a nail on the outside of the doorpost.
And on your gates. This implies to carve into the gate and to inset the passage into the carving on the doorpost of the gate . And it is understood that the opposite is also valid, but the way of things is that in the house, which is a clean and protected place, it is better that the passage should be visible on the outside, and on the gates of the city, where the place is not clean and protected so much, it is better that they [the words] be enclosed.

Verse 12

This portion is puzzling. Everything possible to ask within the power of man is expressed in this request. What else further could be asked? In fact, the Midrash (Midrash Tehillim 27:5) relates that when David said “One thing I ask from Hashem, this I beseech, let me sit in house of Hashem all the days of my life…” G-d said to David, “You said ‘One thing I ask from Hashem…’, but you asked for many things?” [David] answered, “You too said ‘What does Hashem ask of you…’ and then asked for many things.” Even though it is only a light-hearted exchange, still it is certain that both Hashem and David would not have asked for more than what they said initially. Adding to the difficulty, [on this verse] the Talmud (Megillah 25a:10) comments, ‘Is fear [of Heaven] a minor thing?’ and it answers, ‘Yes, to Moshe it is a minor thing.’ What makes this passage surprising is that fear [of Heaven] is not the only item to consider, so why did the Talmud ask on it more than love or service with all one's soul? Another aspect that’s hard to understand: since it started with asking to love Him, why did it immediately contradict the request by saying it is “for your own good”? Rashi (Rashi on Deuteronomy 10:13) explains that phrase to mean ‘in order that it shall be good for you’, which is the opposite of love. But all this notwithstanding, we need to understand to whom is this verse speaking. If it is speaking to all of Israel equally, how is it possible [to expect] this spiritual level of fear [of Hashem] and love [of Hashem] from the least of Israel, who are not capable of reaching them at all? Love can only be reached by means of Torah or service in the Temple, which are the bread that joins Israel to their Father in Heaven, as it writes in the book of Numbers 28:2 in the verse “my sacrifice, my bread…”, and in many other places. How could Hashem come with complaints against His creations to ask of them something which is impossible to achieve in a natural way? And if you will suggest that it speaks only to those fit to achieve these things, see the verse did not specify who it was speaking to. Rather it must be that you can contemplate and deduce from this verse itself that Hashem is not asking from Israel [as a whole], but from each person according to their ability. For behold it writes “to walk in all of His ways”, but it doesn't write “ *and* to walk in all of His ways”, like it writes [next] “and to love Him and to serve…” So too in verse 13, “to guard the commandments of Hashem”, but not “ *and* to guard…” It is clear that it is like the start of a separate expression, and from this we can understand the matter. It is appropriate to know that there are four spiritual levels in Israel, as we explained in the portion of Balak “How goodly are your tents…” They are (1) heads and leaders of Israel, (2) scholars, also called the elders of Israel, (3) laymen occupied with earning a living, and (4) women, servants and children. Each one of these groups differs from the other in terms of what Hashem asks of them. That is why it writes in the portion “You are standing today, all of you, your heads, your tribes, your elders and your officers. Every man of Israel, your infants, your women... to cross over into the covenant of Hashem…” On the face of it, why did the text need to include these [groups]? It writes “You are standing today, all of you... to cross over into the covenant of Hashem.” Everyone is included! Rather, it is because each one has a separate covenant, and what Hashem asks of this group He does not ask of that group, almost as if [these expectations] are forbidden to a second group, as we will explain. Proceeding in the order used in the verse: “Your heads, your tribes.” These are the heads and directors of that generation, who can be described as ‘working for the needs of the community’. They are not permitted to stop this work, not even to toil in love [of Hashem] or closeness [to Him], because that would not be in keeping with the diligence required of them in their unadulterated service of the community. It states in Tractate Shabbat: ‘Hosting guests is even greater than receiving the Divine Presence, as it says “Please do not pass from upon your servant.”’ The explanation is not that someone who merits to receive the Divine Presence cannot be compared to someone who is a host to guests, but simply that this particular mitzvah is greater than the other one and pushes it aside, like our father Avraham did even at the very moment he stood before Hashem, as it writes “And Hashem appeared to him,” but when he saw guests he begged leave from Hashem to depart from Him but without leaving completely, rather He should wait for him until he had treated the guests in a manner fitting for them. From this we can understand [the priority of] taking care of communal needs, for they embody a commandment even greater than hosting guests. Behold, someone involved in taking care of communal needs is exempt from the commandment to read Shema, as related in a Tosefta in Brachot: ‘This is the reason that Rabi Yishmael thought Rabi Akiva and Rabi Elazar ben Azariya did not read the Shema: because they were taking care of communal needs.’ How much more so is this commandment so great as to push aside the commandments of love [of Hashem] and closeness [to Him], which themselves are pushed aside before practical, active obligations, as is written in the portion of tzitzit. If so, then what does Hashem ask of the leaders of Israel? Not love [of Hashem] and closeness [to Him], nor guarding the performance of good deeds, but fear [of Him], meaning he should be steeped constantly in fear of Hashem. This is because someone in a leadership position who is taking care of the needs of the public, could be drawn to seek his own benefit or honour through his deeds. He might grant advantage to those who flatter him or alternatively, to someone who encroaches on his honour he might hide his eyes from seeing his suffering or even find opportunity to cause him evil. That is why it writes about him “What does Hashem ask of you, only to fear [Him].” At all times he needs to know “above even a high official is a higher authority...” There is a further reason for him to fear Hashem more than anyone else – because transgressions between man and his fellow are not easily atoned for. It states “man is considered forewarned [for damages] whether by accident or on purpose,” which is not the case regarding sins between a man and Heaven. King David says: “I hate those who hate You... examine me Hashem and know my heart... see if I have vexatious ways, and guide me on a path of eternity.” The explanation is: if I err in my evaluation of someone as one of those who hate You and as a result pursue him and hate him, but in fact I am not in line with the truth, then it would be better for me to die, that You should “guide me on a path of eternity.” For the mistake cannot be fixed and repentance will not help. This specific expectation applies to the heads and leaders of Israel and no others.

The elders are instructed only “to go in His ways and to love Him and to serve Hashem with all your heart and with all your soul.” The common folk of the nation of Israel are required only “to guard the commandments of Hashem...” To the children, women and convert applies only “...for your good.” And still all these injunctions are stated together because this portion is said inclusive of all the assembly of Hashem, who contain within them all manner of people and everything required of each individual. David acted in a similar manner when he asked “one thing” of Hashem, meaning that each person should receive what is fitting for him. A Talmid Chacham should sit in in the House of Hashem, to see His pleasantness and to visit His Temple. Someone who is not fit for such a level will continue with his work, and should be sheltered in his covering when an evil day comes. One who goes out to war with His enemies should be raised up high on rock [in victory]. Nonetheless these requests are made on behalf of all Israel, and it is understood that at one time a man might stand in a position and Hashem will require of him a specific duty, and in turn he will ask for his specific needs, and at another time he will hold another position and he will be like that other man.

<b>And you shall say, etc.:</b>  The explanation of "saying" [here] is not like its simple meaning, but rather like [its] usage in the phrase (Deuteronomy 12:20), “and you shall say,' I want to eat meat'” and in similar [instances]. However according to this usage, it is implied that this is not an absolute commandment to appoint a king, but rather optional, as in the case of “and you shall say, 'I want to eat meat,' etc.” And behold it is known in the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed, that it is a commandment to appoint a king. But, if so, why is it written, "and you shall say, etc.?" And it appears that it is because the government of a state depends upon whether it is run according to the opinion of a monarchy or according to the opinion of the people and its representatives: and there are states that cannot support the opinion of the monarchy and there are states that without a king are like a ship without a captain. And [so] such a thing cannot be done according to the coercion of a positive commandment, since a matter that is relevant to the government of the public touches upon mortal danger (<i>sakanat nefashot</i>) which pushes off a positive commandment. For this reason, it is impossible to absolutely command the appointment of king so long as it is without the consent of the people to support the yoke of the king as a result of their seeing states around them functioning more properly [with a king]. And then [only when they do so] is it a positive commandment for the Sanhedrin to appoint a king. And behold, it is certainly impossible to explain that there is no positive commandment here at all, but rather it is like, “and you shall say, 'I want to eat meat,' etc. and you shall slaughter from your cattle, etc.” which is only a negative commandment that comes out of a positive [statement], not to eat without ritual slaughter (<i>shechita</i>); [and that] here too, we would say that this is its explanation - "Surely place upon yourself a king that He will choose, etc., you may not, etc.," [meaning] specifically "that He will choose." But it is impossible to explain like this, as if so, what is it saying, "and you will possess and you will settle" and not before? Behold, even before the possession, it is permitted to [establish] a king, as behold, Yehoshua was like a king, as is written by Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 1:3 and 3:8, see there, and Sanhedrin 19. But rather perforce, it is a commandment; yet regardless the Sanhedrin is is not commanded [to act upon it] until the people say that they want the administration of a king. And it is for this reason that for all of three hundred years, while the Tabernacle was in Shilo, there was no king; because it was lacking the people’s agreement. 
<b>"Like all the nations that are around me":</b> This is not discussing laws (<i>mishpatim</i>), since it is forbidden for us to go away from the laws of the Torah. And about this was the Holy One, blessed be He, upset with the Jews in the days of Shmuel, when they said, "'and our king will judge us like all of the nations, etc.'" And [it is] also not [concerning] the matter of war with the nations of the world, since also [about] this did the Holy One, blessed be He, get upset: And he said to Shmuel that (I Samuel 8:7), "'not with you did they get sick but rather with My being king over them have they gotten sick'" - the explanation [is that] they did not intend [it] concerning the matter of laws that concern Shmuel, but rather regarding the matter of war; as throughout the days of the Judges they were without a permanent supervisor for the needs of the group regarding the matter of war with the nations of the world, [but it was only addressed] when the word of God came through the Judge; and they wanted that a king should supervise this, and about this did the Holy One, blessed be He, get upset. But rather the explanation of our verse,  <b>"'like all the nations that are around me'"</b> is concerning the administration of the state, and as I have written (above): that in regards to this, there are different opinions among people as to which (form of government) functions better. And because of that, the agreement of the state is required; that they say, "'I will surely, etc.'"

... <b>as you may eat from it:</b>In anything that we will need for the benefit of man, it is a commandment not to destroy [it], but rather to benefit from it...

... Because man is compared to a tree of the field. And behold this comparison is found in several ways... And the explanation of the comparison [regarding the siege of war, which is only with a fruit tree] is that it is like [when] there is a man sent secretly by the besiegers (on the outside of the city) to be inside the siege in order to assist the besiegers break open the city by his causing division inside; and behold when the city is broken open and they kill the people of the besieged city - would they think of also killing those same people that came into the siege for the purpose of the besiegers and for their benefit?! So too does the fruit tree come for the benefit of the besiegers, since they benefit from its fruit at the time when they pluck the fresh fruit off of the tree. Hence it is fitting to appreciate it.

The Holy Blessed One wanted to acclimate Israel to the refinements of the soul. And as a soul becomes more exalted it draws closer to that which it is close to. Therefore, he commanded him to remember the ties of brotherhood with the children of Edom. 
And this too is a characteristic of a refined soul to pay back the good that is done to one and not to be ungrateful such that one would be considered base. And for this reason the Holy Blessed One trained us with this mitzvah.

Verse 15

It is known according to the Midrash Shemot Rabbah perek 41 that every time the Torah uses the word Hashkafa, it has negative connotations. In this case, the word is used to show how great the strength of people who take ma'asrot that they can turn negative language into positive. It is surprising why use negative language and reverse it. What would be lost if the pasuk just used the world "hibitu" [which has a positive connotation]. The language of "From your holy dwelling place, from the heavens" should also be examined since the p'shat is repetAlthough in Chagiga (12) a "ma'on" (dwelling place) is called "shamayim" (heavens), as it quotes [our pasuk] "from your holy dwelling place, from the heavens." The repetition is because of the word "min" (from). The pasuk does not say "from your holy dwelling place the heavens." This teaches two things: The heavens are a place of the planets and stars that emanate blessing onto Earth. Additionally, the gemara in Chagiga (12) explains that me'on is the place where the heavenly angels dwell. And the Maharsha already discussed this in his Chiddushe Aggadot. But the explanation of this verse is that the person who brings bikkurim is glorified in his actions that he did everything to the best of his abilities. He therefore comes to ask for heavenly mercy that God should bless Israel and their land. In truth, a person can not be so certain in his or her deeds that his or her prayers will be heard from on high. For without a doubt this person has made some mistake. Therefore, this prayer was established with the words hashkifa mime'on kodhecha. An explanation: Look down (hashkifa) negatively upon the malachei hasharet. And find in them mistakes. Therefore, look down upon us from the Heavens and bless etc. And, in your mercy, do not focus on any mistakes that were made. In this way everything becomes clear: this is why it is reasonable to say hashkifah etc. But it could have said hashkifah meme'on kodshecha vehabitah min hashamayim, like in Tehillim 102. Instead, it is written as is to teach that "someone who brings ma'asrot" etc.

Chapter 29



Verse 1

<b>And Moses called, etc.</b> It is evident that this section is one of comfort and is meant to reassure Israel after the ninety-eight curses, which do not fall on any [other] nation or culture when they are exiled and punished by the ruling nation. Which is to say that the dispersal is not so far—<i>among all the nations from one end of the earth, etc.</i> (Deuteronomy 28:64), and also the suffering at the time of their destruction is not so extreme, as Daniel said: <i>He fulfilled his word on us that he spoke against us... bringing on us this great tragedy, that there has never been done under the heavens what was done in Jerusalem</i> (Daniel 9:12). And Moses intends to placate the people. <br><br>But these comforts are not transparent. And what new disclosure did he make to them that would calm their hearts? And the final verse also isn’t clear: <i>And you shall keep the words of this covenant, etc.</i>—what is there to keep and to do with this covenant, which is nothing but receiving blessings and curses? <br><br>Before we come to the explanation of the verses, we must remark that Israel are called by God’s name for His glory and kingship—so that through them, God’s glory and kingship may be revealed over the whole world. And if the glory of God’s kingship cannot be revealed any other way, we cannot clamor against this, because it is for this purpose that we were created. And like a flesh and blood king, who conscripts his soldiers to great labor in frequent war—in the day they do not rest, and in the night they have no quiet, and also they are endangered and injured in the war—they cannot complain about this at all. For this is not, God forbid, from the ill intentions of the king. Rather, it is because he needs to expand his kingdom, and that is how he comes to be king in the province. And thus, they enter into his service with strength and guard the kingdom with their bodies and with their lives. So too, the King of kings of kings, the Holy Blessed One, created His world in order that His glory fill all of creation, as is written in the book of Genesis 2:4. And to that end, He took us to be His nation and His slaves, so that this purpose will be fulfilled through our agency. Therefore, any way necessity provides to arrive at that end, we have nothing to complain about at all. We have already explained in Genesis 17:4 that this is the meaning of <i>I have made you the father of many nations</i> (Genesis 17:4)—that Abraham and his descendents were sanctified as the chosen nation <i>to be a covenent of peoples and a light of nations</i> (Isaiah 42:6) through their faith, even without them being converts and entering within Israel, rather by displacing idolatry from the land. And this is clarified also in the binding of Isaac, that the descendents of Abraham were sanctified for this purpose, to reach that end, even through all the suffering in the world. And we explained there King David’s statement in the name of the children of Israel, <i>though you crushed us in a place of beasts, ... For your sake we were killed all day, we were considered as sheep for the slaughter</i> (Psalms 44:20-23); see there (Harchev Davar on Genesis 22:17). That is the overall essense of the matter. <br><br>And now we will come to the clarification of the verses with which Moses our teacher placated all of Israel, and said <i>you saw all that God did, etc.</i> (Deuteronomy 29:1)—he began that in everything you saw, God showed the essense of His desire, that His name and glory grow in the whole land. And he explained how He thus demonstrated this purpose:

<b>And gather you from all of the nations:</b> After the main exile returns from the nations, the Lord will return to gather the small pockets among the nations where the Lord scattered you. Likewise did Ramban write 1 in his commentary on Song of Songs (8:12), "you may have the thousand, O Solomon" - that at first, there will be a partial gathering of the exiles with the permission of the governments. And afterwards, the Lord will bring back His hand a second time, as it is written, "and He will return and gather you."

Verse 3

<b>He will cross over before you:</b> Behold we saw four expressions of providence in this section: "He will precede (over) ahead of you"; "He goes with you"; "He is the one who will go ahead of you"; "He will be with you." And it is all precise. But we should first see the language of the Gemara, Pesachim 7b:    Shmuel said, "With regard to all the commandments, one recites a blessing over them prior to (over) their performance." From where may it be inferred that the word, over, is an expression of precedence?... Abbaye said... "And their king preceded [vaya’avor] ahead of them" (Micah 2:13).     But it is difficult, why did Shmuel say it with an expression that needs to be explained (why did he choose this unusual unclear expression, "over their performance")? He should say, "kodem (before)" their performance," or "lifnei (ahead of)" their performance!" Rather there is a profound intention in this [choice of words]. Kodem and lifnei imply that he has not started with the commandment at all. As a result, he used the expression, "over," which implies immediately adjacent; such that he is holding the item of the commandment in his hand, and he will then begin to recite the blessing. And this is the intention of, "and their king passed ahead of them" - as it is clear that the king will not begin to go until all of his army is ready to go out and they are standing at the border...
From here we understand the difference between that which is written about the time of the exodus from Egypt (Exodus 13:21), "And the Lord went lifneihem (ahead of them) by day"... which implies, before Israel went - as behold Israel did not do anything, neither regarding the splitting of the Red Sea, nor regarding the killing of snakes and scorpions. However now Moses says that it shall not be so, but rather the Lord "will over (precede) ahead of you" - adjacently to your action...

<b>Do not be in dread:</b> Onkelos translated, "and you shall not break." Likewise did Onklos translate (31:8), "do not be dismayed," "do not break." Nevertheless there is certainly a difference in the meanings: "Dread" is the breaking of a platoon, such that they give themselves up to their enemies, whereas "dismay" is the breaking of the heart...

<b>He shall not fail you:</b> When you are fit and merit [it].
<b>nor forsake you:</b> Whey you are fit for punishment, He will certainly fail you, but He will not completely forsake you, God forbid. Rather He stands a bit away, until they receive their punishment. And then the Holy One, blessed be He, returns to them.

Verse 7

There are two meanings in this, according to the manner of Mishneh Torah (Deuteronomy).

Verse 8

<b>He is the who will go ahead of you:</b> As the Holy One, blessed be He, will be seen with you and He will command you prior to your beginning with rulership. And in this manner, it is called "going ahead of you" - prior to your placing yourself as the leader. And for this reason, when the Holy One, blessed be He, comes to reassure Joshua later on (verse 23), He only says the second reassurance of Moshe, "and I will be with you."

<b>His firstborn ox:</b> An ox is a major provider of produce, as it is written (Proverbs 14:4), "but there is much produce in the strength of the ox." That is why he called the impact of the tribe of Yosef an ox; and the firstborn ox is the choice conduit. So since Yosef was outstanding at deeds of lovingkindness and provided all the good, that is why he named him, firstborn ox. It is like (Job 18:13), " the firstborn death," the meaning of which is an outstanding death.
