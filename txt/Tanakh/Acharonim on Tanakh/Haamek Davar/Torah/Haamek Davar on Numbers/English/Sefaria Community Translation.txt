Introduction to Numbers







Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>In the Sinai Desert:</b> ... Since only those that go out in the army were counted - meaning those fitting to be counted in the force of the King for war with the Canaanites. And the earlier count was 605,550 and the [requirement for] the dwelling of the Divine Presence was fixed at that amount, and it was known that it was necessary for there to be this amount in the desert. And from then on, even if there were many that turned twenty, they did not enter the army to fill this amount with [these] others who turned twenty. And since they stood in one place [since that count], the Holy One, blessed be He, did not concern Himself to command that they fill the army [for those that had died in between], until the twentieth day of the second month approached. As they were then prepared to leave on the journey with God at their head, like a king at the head of his armies. Hence the command came to count again and to fill this amount... [just like] every king knows how many are going out in the army in his force and how many units, and the amount in each unit...

"May God bless you." Included in this is whatever is appropriate for each person to be blessed with. As is written in Deuteronomy 16:16: "they shall not appear before the LORD empty...according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which He hath given thee." The blessing will be according to the blessing that he was blessed with until then: For one who deals in Torah, in his study. For one who deals in commerce, in his merchandise. Thus is included in this general blessing "May God bless you" an additional blessing for each person about what he has.
"And protect you." For every blessing requires protection so that it does not become an obstacle, God forbid. A master of Torah needs protection from pride, desecration of God's name and the like. And similarly, that he not forget his learning. A property owner needs protection that his wealth not be to his detriment, like Korach and Navot the Jezreelite and the like. And similarly, protection from theft and loss. And likewise for everything that is in need of blessing, protection from whatever causes trouble is requested.

Verse 1

According to the simple meaning of the text, a gentile black woman. But who had converted. And Aaron and Miriam thought that this was why Moshe separated himself from her. That his wife was not of Israelite lineage. And they were saying that under no circumstances is this proper. After he had taken her and knew she was a non-Israelite and she didn't deceive him. Therefore it's not fair to make her sad and separate himself from her. [Afterwards I saw this commentary in the book "Paanekh Razei" who as his custom explains כושית as being black.

This example shows that God can see all of the world just as Moshe sees. And if he knows, he knew what they said about him. They did not find it in their hearts to tell him [directly] to his face. And because of this God rebuked that also now, it was as if they had spoken to his face.

<b>And they went up into the South:</b> It is a recounting of a detail about that which happened with the people that went into the South. As they actually did not all go together, but rather divided the land, two by two - hence they [were able to] finish their touring in forty days. And so the verse is speaking about the two that went up into the South; and they are Caleb and one other [scout]. 
<b>And he came to Chevron:</b> One of them - and that was Caleb - came into the city and the fortress, whereas the other one was afraid to enter the city out of fear from the Anakites - and also [because] it is hard to escape from the fortress, should it be required. But the one (Caleb) came without fear, saw the Anakites and did not tremble from any [of this].

<b>One law and one ordinance:</b> The teachings that the sages of each generation add are called "law" ("<i>Torah</i>"). And a commandment matter which is not explicit in the Torah is a just "<b>ordinance</b>" based on the intellect. On all of this is written "<b>shall be both for you, and for the stranger ...</b>" - it will be equal, without distinction. <b>And see that</b> Scripture calls commandments that are explicit in the Torah "statute." Ans this is as I wrote on Exodus 18:16 - all of the commandments that are explicit in the Torah, even if they do have a reason. In any case, even where the reason is missing, the commandment stands its ground. If the details of the commandment are without reason, and are only "statute." For once they are explicit in the Torah, they are statutes which the Heavens and the Earth stand upon, as I wrote on Leviticus, at the beginning of the "<i>Bechukotai</i>" ("In My statutes") portion. However, the teachings of the sages of the generation go along with the reasoning, so as soon as the reason changes, the rule changes. Therefore, Scripture calls them "law and ordinance."

<b>And a man who becomes <i>tamei</i></b> - earlier the punishment is written with regard to one who touches a whole dead body, which is severe. And here it returns and explains that this is the ruling in these <i>tumot</i>.
<b>From the midst of the congregation</b>. At the time that he [the sinner] is with the community. That is, at the time of pilgrimage to appear in the Temple's courtyard. That this is why it [the verse] concludes <b>for God's Temple he has impurified</b>. Since it is an accepted tradition of Chazal that it appears that there's a practical difference between the sanctity of the Tabernacle (since it's temporary) and the sanctity of the Temple (which is permanent). For in the Tabernacle, truly one is only liable for touching a whole dead body. However, it's an accepted tradition of Chazal in Shevuot 16b that this is not the case. Since in any case it's been already explained in parshat Kedoshim, and in any case although we learn from a <i>gezeira sheva</i> from one to the other. In any case, they are dissimilar, the punishment that comes from a <i>gezeira sheva</i> to one that is explicit in the Torah.

"Will not be regarded." They are not considered in their [nations'] eyes as people worth regarding at all. (Similarly, the language of the Mishnah - Shevi’it, Chapter 8, Mishnah 11 - “And if he is regarded,” meaning he is respected and esteemed.) As it says in Sanhedrin 104a: "I said that Israel would dwell securely alone, in the isolation of Yaakov's eye, but now they sit alone in distress." This means that My [God’s] desire was for Israel to remain separate, to not mingle with other nations, and thus they would be secure. Now, because they desired to assimilate with other nations, they have become isolated, and no nation values them enough to include them. And in Pesachim 118b, [it is written,] “The mingling of nations—they long for closeness.” Who caused Israel to be scattered among the nations? It was the closeness that they longed for with them. And [it is brought in] Shemot Rabbah 1, that Israel in exile in Egypt, they refrained from circumcision, saying, “Let us be like the Egyptians.” So, what did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He turned the hearts of the Egyptians to hate His people. They thought that since they were in exile, it was proper not to remain separate from them. But the opposite happened: the Egyptians separated themselves from Israel. And a reason for this was because the people of G-d have a distinct form, elevated above other peoples. And I have already explained above (21:20). Someone with a higher form who destroys it becomes worse than those beneath him and is scorned by them. If this is so, this is a sign that Israel’s origins are from the “tops of the rocks”. This is why the form of a person is not easily lost, as it is natural for everyone to preserve their essential form, for which they were created. And therefore, someone who goes, in every event, against their intended form is not considered a human at all. And behold, he is like an ape in the form of a human.

<b>The Children of Seth (Shet):</b> [This is] like the sons of Adam (all people), since [Seth] was the main [son of Adam], as Noah was from his descendants (such that everyone who lived afterwards was of the Children of Seth). And the Yitzchaki1 said that its understanding is [that it refers to] the Children of Ammon and also [the Children of] Moab, and its meaning is [hence] twofold. He also said that its usage [is like its usage in], "those with revealed shet" (Isaiah 11:3), which is a reference to the daughters of Lot (the mothers of Ammon and Moab). But that is distant [from the correct understanding] in my eyes; as shet is the posterior, which is like a foundation, as in (Psalms 11:3), "When the shatot are destroyed." And many understood, "all the children of shet" as the same usage as "When the shatot." And the explanation is that when he destroys the countries (which are like foundations). And this is not distant.

And you shall set him, etc.: This setting is [to give him] authority over them. And nevertheless it is only service, as he is obligated to serve them in that which he has authority over them. Therefore, it is written with the wording, "And you shall set him in front of " - with the same wording as later on [in verse] 21, which demonstrates subservience. This is because authority is truly also subservience.

This is according to the simple interpretation (peshat). But in the Gemara (Yevamot), the Sages explained it differently in the manner of aggadah (drash).

<b>They shall be for wives according to their own preference.</b> It has already been explained in Parashat Pinchas that the daughters of Tzelafchad were permitted to inherit, as it is written, "And you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them" (Numbers 27:7). And the phrase "however, to the family, etc." is only advice, as mentioned in the tractate Yesh Nochalin. It has been clarified earlier that due to their significance, the divine authority allowed for the passing of inheritance. They are like women who have already given birth from another tribe, and they inherit and pass on the inheritance, as explained shortly after. And because of this minor distinction, it does not harm the establishment of the sanctity of the land. However, it is advised that they should not appear more important than any other daughters of their tribe. Therefore, they should conduct themselves like all of them, as it is prohibited to pass on inheritance in that generation. From this, we learn the importance of advice in many matters, and may the advice of God arise for every individual.
