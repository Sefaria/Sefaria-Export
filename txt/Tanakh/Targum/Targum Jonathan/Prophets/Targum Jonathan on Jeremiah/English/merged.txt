Chapter 31

In that time, the Lord said, "I will be a God to the whole family of Israel, and they shall be My people; thus said the Lord: The people that escaped the sword Have found favor in the wilderness— Israel, when I go to give him rest."
"As it is written, says the Lord: I gave compassion to the people who came out of Egypt, and they needed sustenance in the desert, just as they were wandering in the east, being attacked by the sword, he spoke through his words to show them the way to the home of rest, the land of Israel."...
"I teach Jerusalem from ancient times: from the early days, God revealed himself to our forefathers through the prophets, and said to them: "Have mercy on the world, and the world will have mercy on you." Therefore, speak kindly to one another.
"I will yet again build you up, and you shall be rebuilt, O virgin Israel! Again you shall take up your tambourines, and go forth in the dance of the merrymakers."
"Again you shall plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the planters shall plant and enjoy the fruit." 
I see a long life ahead of me and a lot of good that I am destined to do for the righteous who protect my Torah from ancient times, and I will share with them in the land of Israel, which they loved for the sake of the two comforting consolations that are to come, as they say: "When will we arise and go up to Zion and behold the glory of the Lord our God?"
"As it is said: 'The Lord, praise Him, extolled the house of Jacob alone, and they gathered at the head of the exiles before the eyes of all nations, and they praised and said, 'Praise the Lord who returned His people Israel to their remaining portion!'
I will give them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, the expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return.
"In their exile, as they were, they revealed in their writings that in their midst, with great mercy, we draw near and speak about the produce of the land on the path of zeal, so that they do not stumble in it. For my words to Israel were like a father to Ephraim, beloved before me."
"Accept the saying of the Lord, O people, and dwell in His protection from afar, and say: As for Israel, let his needs be gathered and let his debts be paid like a flock."
God has redeemed the house of Jacob and saved us from the hands of the strong.
"They shall sit and praise in the courtyard of the rebuilt Temple in Zion, and they shall delight in the goodness that the Lord will give them, with wine, oil, and fine flour, and with sons of the flock and the herd. And their souls shall be satisfied like a watered garden, like a spring whose waters do not fail."
Therefore, let the women of Israel dress themselves in mourning attire like in the city of Hingin, with headbands, veils, and belts, and let us turn their mourning into feasting, and let us console and join together with them.
"And the souls of the priests shall be satisfied with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord.
"Thus says the Lord: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because they are no more."
Thus says the Lord: "Keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work, declares the Lord, and they shall come back from the land of the enemy. And there is hope for your future, declares the Lord, and your children shall come back to their own country."
"And I have a plan for your end, says the Lord, and your children will return to their borders."
I hear and reveal before Me the house of Israel, their words and their groaning because they are wandering without direction. They say "We are like sheep without a shepherd, and we do not know how to tread the path. When will You come and guide us, O Lord our God?"
"As I sit and rest in the light of the Torah, I am comforted, and as it is revealed to us, I am strengthened in my legs while sitting, and even as I receive the kindness of the previous generations."
"The beloved one, who preceded me, Israel, is he not a master of mercy? For when he hears the words of the Torah, he applies them to his heart, to act upon them in memory of the past. Therefore, My mercies are revealed upon them, and I have mercy upon them, as it is said: 'The Lord spoke thus: I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.'"
As a woman of Israel, I remember you, workers of your Father, fixers of broken things. Pour out supplications with bitter cries from your embittered heart. Look at the workers whom you have worked with, if they are thus fixed, you will have paved a distant path to return. Thus, return as a woman of Israel and you will be called upon.
Until when will you refuse to get vaccinated, to help the great community, for the Lord has created a new plague in the land, and the people of the house of Israel should submit to the Torah.
"As the LORD of hosts lives, the God of Israel, they shall again speak these words in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I restore their fortunes: 'The LORD bless you, O habitation of righteousness, O holy hill!'"
"And the house of Judah and all its surrounding villages shall dwell in it together—farmers and those who wander with their flocks." [edit: This verse is from the book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:23) and describes a future time when the people of Judah will return to their homeland and live together in peace and harmony, working the land and caring for their flocks.]...
"I am satisfied with my portion, and all souls shall be nourished; I lack nothing good."
"The prophet said regarding the good news of the days of consolation, that in the future the dead will be resurrected and you will see the house that you have longed for and I will give you rest."
In that day, says the Lord, I will raise up the house of Judah and I will save them as a man saves his flock, and they shall be as a city that is inhabited.
"And as for the matter which you are contemplating, namely, demolition, ruin, corpses, destruction, and annihilation, so shall it be with the people of these places, for the purpose of building and rebuilding, says the Lord."
"On that day, they will no longer say, 'Our fathers ate sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are blunted.'" 
"May the God of his creditor cause every man who does not pay to die, and whoever sins against them shall also die."
"On this day, says the Lord, I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah."
"Not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not abide by my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord."
"When the decree that was made with the house of Israel has been fulfilled after those days," says the Lord, "I will put my Torah within them, and I will write it on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
"They will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest," declares the Lord, "for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."
Thus says the Lord, who gives the sun for light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar - the Lord of hosts is his name:
Just as it is impossible for these laws to cease to exist before Me, says the Lord, so too the offspring of Israel will never cease to be a nation before Me, serving Me every day.
Thus says the Lord, how can anyone understand the secrets of heaven from the beginning, or even investigate the foundations of the earth from below? But I will not cast off the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says the Lord.
On that day, said the Lord, the city of Jerusalem shall be built up from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. (Zechariah 14:10)
"And let another thread come out to smear (or anoint) the building until reaching the hill of the ordination to the calf's foot, and let him trade for the pool of the circle (or the circular pool)."
"And all the straight paths that fell there, the remains of the palaces of the city, and all the foundations to the Nachla of Kidron, to the corner of the house of Reisah d'Malka, the holy kingdom of God, will not be uprooted or scattered anymore for eternity."
