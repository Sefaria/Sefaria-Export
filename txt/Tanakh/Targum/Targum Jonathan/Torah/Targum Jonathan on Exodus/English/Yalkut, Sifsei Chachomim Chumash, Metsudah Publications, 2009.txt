This refers to the two hundred thousand men of Ephraim who had left Egypt thirty years earlier and had gone to Philistia. Because they violated the Divine decree by leaving before the appointed time, they were delivered into the hands of the Philistines. These were the dry bones that were later revived by the prophet Yechezkel.
