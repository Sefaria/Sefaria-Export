Aramaic Targum to Psalms



Chapter 1

Happy the man who has not walked in the council of the wicked, or stood in the paths of sinners, or taken a seat in the band of mockers.
Instead his pleasure is in the law of the Lord, and in his Torah he meditates day and night. 
And he will be like a living tree planted by streams of water, whose fruit ripens in due course, and its leaves do not fall, and all its branches that grow ripen and flourish.
Not so the wicked; instead, they are like the chaff that the storm-wind will drive.
Therefore the wicked will not be acquitted in the great day, nor sinners in the band of the righteous, 
Because the path of the righteous is manifest in the Lord’s presence, but the paths of the wicked will perish.

Chapter 2

Why are the nations disturbed, and murmuring vanity?
The kings of the earth arise and the rulers will join together to rebel in the Lord’s presence, and to strive against His Anointed.
They say, “Let us break their bonds, and let us throw off their chains from us.”
The One Who sits in Heaven will laugh; the word of the Lord will mock at them.
Then He will speak to them in His strength, and in His wrath He will frighten them.
"And I have anointed My king, and appointed him over My Sanctuary."
I will tell of the covenant of the Lord. He said: “You are as dear to Me as a son to a father, pure as if this day I had created you.”
"Ask Me and I will give the spoils of nations as your inheritance, the rulers of the ends of the earth as your holding."
"You will shatter them as with a rod of iron, like a potter’s vessel you will break them."
And now, O kings, grow wise; accept discipline, O princes of the earth.
Worship in the presence of the Lord with fear, and pray with trembling.
Accept instruction lest He be angry, and you lose your way; for His wrath will tarry a little. Happy all who trust in His Word!

Chapter 3

A psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of Absalom his son.
Lord, how many are my oppressors, many who arise against me!
Many say to my soul, “There is no redemption for him in God forever.”
But you, Lord, are a shield over me, my glory and the one who raises my head.
I pray, my voice in the presence of the Lord; He will accept my prayer from the Mount of His Holy Temple forever.
I lay down, and I slept; I awoke, because the Lord sustains me.
I will not be afraid of the myriads of people who have gathered against me all around.
Arise, O Lord, redeem me, O my God; for you have struck all my enemies on their cheek, you have broken the teeth of the wicked.
Redemption is from the presence of the Lord; your blessings are to your people forever.

Chapter 4

 For praise, with melodies: A hymn of David
At the time of my prayer, accept it from me, O God of my righteousness; at the time of distress, you relieved me; pity me and accept my prayer.
Sons of men, why is my glory for humiliation? You will love vanity; you will seek falsehood forever.
And they will know, for the Lord has separated the righteous man for Himself; the Lord will accept the prayer of David when he calls to Him.
Tremble for Him, and do not sin; utter your petition with your mouth and your request in your heart; and pray upon your beds and remember the days of death forever.
Subdue your impulses and it will be reckoned to you as a righteous sacrifice; and hope in the Lord.
Many say, “Who will show us good?” Lift on us the light of your countenance, O Lord
You have placed joy in my heart when their grain and their wine has increased.
In peace I both lay down and sleep, because you alone are the Lord; in security you will make me dwell.

Chapter 5

For praise, with dancing. A hymn of David.
Hear my utterance, O LORD, consider my murmuring.
Hear the sound of my petition, my king and God, for I will pray in your presence.
O LORD, in the morning hear my voice; in the morning I set myself before you and keep watch.
Because you are not a God who takes pleasure in<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">does not desire</i> wickedness; evil did not abide with you.
Scoffers shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all deeds<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">doers</i> of falsehood.
You will destroy tellers of lies; the Lord will loath the man <i>who sheds innocent</i> blood and the deceiver.
And I, through your great goodness, will enter your house; I will bow down to your holy temple in awe of you.
O LORD, guide me by your righteousness; because of my <i>hymn</i>, make firm your paths before me.
Because there is no reliability in the mouths <i>of the wicked;</i> their bodies <i>are full of</i> tumult; <i>like Sheol,</i> their throat is open; their tongues flatter.
God has accused them; they will be done away with by their counsel; for their great sin he overturned them, for they rebelled against <i>your command.</i>
And all who trust in your word will rejoice forever; they will give praise and you will protect them; and those who love your name will rejoice in you.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">in your word</i>
Because you will bless the righteous, O LORD; as with a shield, you will crown him with <i>good</i> will.

Chapter 6

For praise; with melodies on <i>the harp of eight strings</i>. A hymn of David.
O LORD, do not humble<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">rebuke</i> me in your anger; and do not punish me in your wrath.
Pity me, O LORD,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">God</i> for I am weak; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are terrified.
And my soul is greatly terrified; and you, O LORD, when <i>will you give me relief</i>?
Turn, O LORD, save my soul, redeem me for the sake of your goodness.
For there is no memory of you in death; in Sheol who will give you thanks?
I am wearied with my groaning; I will <i>speak<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Tg אמלל suggests אשיחה</i> in my sorrow</i> every night on my bed; I will drown my couch with my tears.
My eye is dark from my trouble; it is worn out by all my oppressors.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">distress</i>
Leave me, all doers of falsehood; for the LORD has heard<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">accepted</i> the sound of my weeping.
My petition<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">supplication</i> has been heard in the LORD’s presence; the LORD will accept my prayer.
All of my enemies will be ashamed and very afraid; they will turn and be ashamed in an instant.

Chapter 7

<i>A rendition of the thanksgiving</i> of David, who gave praise to the Lord; for he spoke <i>a song about the ruin of Saul son of Kish, from the tribe of</i> Benjamin.
O LORD my God, I have trusted in <i>your word;</i> deliver me from all my persecutors and save me.
Lest he crush my soul like a lion; he will tear and there is no one who will deliver <i>me</i>.
O LORD my God, if I have made this <i>song with evil intent</i>, if there is oppression in my hand,
If I have repaid my ally with evil, or thrust away my oppressor for nothing,
May the enemy pursue my soul, and may he overtake and trample my life to the ground, and may my honor rest in the dust forever.
Arise, O LORD, in your might; be lifted up in anger <i>against</i> my oppressors; and bring hastily to me the justice that you commanded.
The gathering of the nations will surround you; because of it return to <i>the place of your presence.</i>
<i>The word of</i> the LORD will judge the Gentiles; judge me, O LORD, by my merit, and for my innocence recompense me.
Now may the evil of the wicked perish; and let the righteous <i>be firmly established</i>; and the righteous God examines hearts and minds.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">lit. kidneys</i>
My shield is on God, redeemer of the upright of heart.
God is the righteous judge, and <i>in might</i> is angry <i>at the wicked</i> every day.
If one does not repent <i>and reverence him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">lit., return to his fear</i> his sword is whetted, his bow drawn and ready.
On his account, he has prepared the weapons of death; he will make his arrows for those who pursue <i>the righteous</i>.
Behold, he will be in pains with falsehood, and will conceive trouble, and give birth to falsehood.
He has dug a pit and deepened it; and he fell in the pit he made.
His misery will return on his head; and on his pate his rapacity will descend.
I will thank<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">give praise</i> the LORD according to his righteousness; and I will praise the name of God Most High.

Chapter 8

For praise, <i>on the lyre that he brought from</i> Gath. A hymn of David.
O God<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">LORD</i> our master, how lofty is your name <i>and praiseworthy</i> in all the earth, you who have placed your splendor above the heavens.
From the mouth of children and infants you have established strength because of your oppressors, to bring to naught the enemy and the violent man.
Because I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have fixed in place,
What is a son of man, because you will remember <i>his deeds</i>, and a son of man, because you will punish him?
And you have made him a little less than <i>the angels</i>, and you will crown him with glory and brightness.
You made him ruler over the works of your hands; all things you have placed under his feet.
Sheep and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the field.
The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, <i> and Leviathan</i> who passes along<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">burst from</i> the paths of the sea.
O God our master, how lofty <i>and praiseworthy</i> is your name in all the earth!

Chapter 9

For praise, concerning the death of the man<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">+ the warrior</i> <i>who went out</i> between <i>the armies</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">ANOTHER TARGUM</sup><i class="footnote">For praise, concerning the sweetness of the sound by a son.</i> A hymn of David.
I will sing praise <i>in the LORD's presence</i> with all my heart; I will tell all of your miracles.
I will be glad and rejoice in <i>your word</i>; I will praise your name, O Most High.
When my enemies turn back, they will stumble and perish before you.
Because you have accomplished my vindication and my judgment; you sat down on the throne of the <i>righteous</i> judge.
You rebuked the peoples <i>of the Philistines;</i> you destroyed <i>Goliath</i> the wicked; their name you erased forever and ever.
<i>And when</i> the enemy <i>fell, his forces were obliterated,</i> and their fortresses were laid waste forever, and as for their cities, you destroyed the memory of them forever.
But as for <i>the word of</i> the LORD, his seat is in the highest heaven forever; he has established his throne for judgment.
And he shall judge <i>the people of</i> the earth in righteousness; he will judge the Gentiles in uprightness.
And <i>the word of</i> the LORD will be strength to the poor, strength in times of distress.
And those who know your name will look at<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">trust in</i> <i>your hope</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">word</i>, because you have not abandoned those who seek you, O LORD.
Sing praise before the Lord <i>who made his presence</i> rest in Zion; tell his deeds among the Gentiles.
For he avenges the <i>innocent</i> blood; he remembers <i>the righteous</i>, he does not neglect<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">forget</i> the complaint of the humble.
Pity me, O LORD; see my pain caused by my enemies<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">those who hate me</i>, you who lift me up from the entrances of death.
So that I may tell all your praises<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">miracles</i> in the entrances of <i>the gates of the assembly of</i> Zion; I will exult in your redemption.
The peoples have sunk in the pit that they made; in the very net they concealed, their feet are caught.
Manifest before the LORD is the judgement he executed: through the works of his hands,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">aaaaa</i> or he executed on the works of his hands.<i> the righteous will rejoice</i> forever.
The wicked will return to Sheol, all the Gentiles who neglected<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">forgot</i> <i>the fear of</i> the LORD.
For the needy man is not forever neglected;<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">forgotten</i> the hope of the humble will <i>not</i> perish forever.
Arise, O LORD, may the <i>wicked</i> son of man not grow strong, may the Gentiles be judged in your presence.
Put, O LORD, fear on them; let the peoples know that they are a son of man forever.

Chapter 10

Why, O LORD, will you stand afar off, hide yourself <i>in the dwelling of the holy ones</i> in the times of distress?
In brutality<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">pride</i> the wicked man will pursue the poor man; they will be caught in the scheme<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">folly</i> that they plotted to carry out.
For the wicked man is praised for the craving of his soul; he who blesses the violent man abhors <i>the word of</i> the LORD.
The wicked man in the grossness of his spirit will not seek <i>God</i>, and <i>he will say in his heart that his thoughts are not manifest in the presence of the LORD</i>.
His ways prosper at all times; your judgments are far from his sight; he will rebuke all his oppressors.
He will say in his heart, “I will not be shaken from doing evil for all generations.”
His mouth is curses, full of guile and deceit; under his tongue is misery and falsehood.
He will sit in the hiding places of the courtyards; in secret places he will kill the innocent; he will hide his eyes against the poor.
He will lie in wait in secret places like a lion in his covert; he will lie in wait to seize the poor man; he will seize the poor man when he is drawn into his trap.
The poor man will be crushed, and sink down, and he will fall into the power of his hiding places.
He will say in his heart, “God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he does not see forever.”
Arise, O LORD<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">+ our God</i>, fulfill the oath of your hand, do not forget the humble.
Why has the wicked man abhorred God? He will say<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Tg יימר suggests Heb יאמר.</i> in his heart, “It will not be sought after.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">"You will not seek."</i>
It is manifest in your presence, because you <i>will inflict</i> misery and wrath <i>upon the wicked man</i>; look carefully to pay <i>a good reward to the righteous</i> by your hand; the poor will place <i>their hope</i> on you; you have been a helper to the orphan.
Break the arm of the wicked; and let the evil seek their wickedness, [and] not find it.
The LORD is king forever and ever; the Gentiles have perished<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">will perish</i> from his land.
The desire of the humble is heard <i>in your presence</i>, O LORD; strengthen their heart, incline your ear<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">+ to their prayer </i>.
To judge the orphan and poor man; may the sons of men not again be shattered <i>before the wicked of the earth.</i>

Chapter 11

A hymn of David. In <i>the word of</i> the LORD I have hoped; how do you say to my soul, wander to the mountain<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">your mountain</i> like a bird?
For behold, the wicked bend the bow, fixing their arrows on the string to shoot in darkness at the firm<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">upright</i> of heart.
For <i>if</i> the foundations are shattered, why did the virtuous do good?<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">righteous do right</i>
The LORD is in his holy temple; God’s<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">the LORD's</i> throne is in the <i>highest</i> heavens; his eyes see, his eyelids examine, the sons of men.
God<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">the word of the LORD</i> examines the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and those who love rapacity.
He will bring down rains <i>of retribution</i> on the wicked, coals of fire and brimstone; a violent storm-wind is the portion of their cup.
For the LORD is righteous, he loves righteousness,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">virtue</i> the honest man will look upon <i>his</i> countenance.

Chapter 12

For praise, on <i>the lyre of</i> eight <i>strings</i>. A hymn of David.
Redeem, O LORD, for the good<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">righteous</i> are annihilated; for the faithful have ceased from the sons of men.
They speak lies, each to his fellow, lips are flattering; in <i>their</i> heart <i>they deceive,</i> and with <i>a lying</i> heart they speak.
The LORD will destroy <i>from the world</i> all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks arrogance.
Those <i>who deny the essence,</i> who say, “By our tongue we shall prevail, our lips are with us, who is our master?”
Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the cry of the needy, now I will arise,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">+ in judgement</i> says the LORD; I will give redemption <i>to my people, but against the wicked</i> I will give testimony <i>of evil.</i>
The words of the Lord are pure words, silver<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">like silver</i> purified in the furnace on the ground, refined seven times.
You, O Lord, will keep <i>the righteous</i>; you will protect <i>them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Tg תנטרינון suggests Heb תשמרם</i> from this evil generation forever.
All around the wicked walk, like a leech <i>that sucks the blood of</i> the sons of men.


Chapter 13

For praise, a hymn of David.
How long, O LORD, will you neglect me forever? How long will you hide <i>the splendor of</i> your face from me?
How long will I put warnings in my soul, suffering in my heart daily? How long will my enemy vaunt himself over me?
Pay heed and <i>receive my prayer</i>, O LORD my God; illumine my eyes <i>by your Torah</i>, lest <i>I sin and</i> sleep <i>with those who deserve</i> death.
Lest the <i>evil impulse</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">my enemy</i> should say, “I have taken control of him,” [lest] my oppressors rejoice because I stray<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">have strayed</i> <i>from your paths.</i>
But I have placed my trust in your goodness, my heart will rejoice in your redemption; I will give praise in the Lord’s presence because he rewards me <i>with good things.</i>

Chapter 14

For praise; <i>in the spirit of prophecy through</i> David. The fool<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">stupid man</i> said in his heart, “There is no <i>rule of</i> God on the earth.” They corrupted <i>their deeds</i>, they despised <i>goodness and found</i> iniquity. There is none who does good.
The LORD looked down from heaven on the sons of men<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Adam</i> to see if there was any wise man seeking <i>instruction from the presence of</i> the LORD.
All alike have turned backward, they have become lax; there is none who does good, there is not even one.
Do they not know, all doers of falsehood? Those among my people who dine have dined on bread [and] not <i>blessed the name of</i> the LORD.
There they became afraid<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">they worshipped a false gold that is not proper to worship.</i> because <i>the word of</i> the LORD is in the generation of the righteous.
You will despise the counsel of the poor man,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">+ who are humble, who rebuke them</i> because he has placed his hope in the LORD.
Who will produce from Zion the redemption of Israel? When the LORD brings back the exile of his people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.

Chapter 15

A hymn of David. O LORD, who <i>is worthy</i> to dwell in your tabernacle, who <i>is worthy</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">deserves</i> to abide on the mountain of your sanctuary?
One who walks in integrity, and does righteous deeds, and speaks truth in his heart.
He does not slander with his tongue, he causes no harm to his fellow, and he bears no shame<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">disgrace</i> against his neighbor.
Who despises the contemptible to his face, but honors those who fear the LORD; who will swear to do harm <i>to himself</i> and does not change.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">reverse</i>
He has not given his money at interest; he has not accepted a bribe against the innocent; one who does these things will never be moved.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">shaken</i>

Chapter 16

An honest inscription of David. Protect me, O God, because I have hoped<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"> trusted</i> in <i>your word.</i>
You have spoken – <i>you, my soul – in the presence of</i> the LORD. You are my God, <i>truly</i> my goodness is not <i>present</i> without you.
To the holy ones that are in the in the land <i>they have declared the might of my power from the beginning;</i> and as for those proud <i>of their good deeds,</i> my <i>good</i> will is for them.
But the wicked multiply their idols; afterwards they hurry <i>to make their sacrifices.</i> I will not receive <i>favorably</i> their libations <i>or</i> the blood <i>of their sacrifices,</i> nor will I mention their name with my lips.
The LORD is the portion of my cup and my share; you will support<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">take care of.</i> my lot.
The lots have fallen pleasantly for me; indeed, a beautiful inheritance is mine.
I will bless the LORD, who has counseled me; even at night my mind<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">lit: kidneys.</i> disciplines me.
I have placed the LORD<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">the word of the LORD.</i> before me always, for h<i>is presence rests on me;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">at my right hand.</i> I shall not be shaken.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; besides, my flesh shall dwell in security.
For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, you will not hand over your innocent one to see corruption.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">place of corruption.</i>
You will tell me the way of life; abundance of joy is in the presence of your face; pleasant things are at your right hand forever.

Chapter 17

A prayer of David. Accept, O LORD, my entreaty;<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">request</i> in righteousness hear my praise; you will incline your ear to my prayer, since my lips are without guile.
From your presence my judgment shall come forth; your eyes will behold honesty.
You have tested my heart; you have visited me at night; you have purified<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">tested</i> me [and] not found corruption. [If] I thought of evil, it has not passed my mouth.
<i>Truly you have rebuked</i> the deeds of the sons of men by the word of your lips; I have kept [myself from] the ways of audacity.
Support my steps in your path, lest my feet be shaken.
I have called you because you will receive my prayer, O God; incline your ear, receive my prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">hear my speech</i>.
Display your goodness,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">merits.</i> O redeemer of those who hope;<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">+ and avenge them</i> from those who rise up <i>against them</i> by your right hand.
Guard me like the circle<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">the pupil of the circle</i> that is in <i>the middle of</i> the eye; in the shadow of your <i>presence</i> you will hide me.
From the presence of the wicked, those who harm me; my enemies, in the desire of their soul, surround me.
<i>Their wealth has increased,</i> their fat covers [them], their mouth has spoken arrogantly.
Our steps now have surrounded us; their eyes are fixed to extend throughout the land.
He resembles a lion who yearns to tear, or a jungle-cat that dwells in secret places.
Arise, O LORD<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">God</i>, forestall him, strike him down; deliver my soul from the wicked man <i>who deserves death</i> by your sword.
<i>And the righteous who hand over their souls on your account,</i> O LORD, <i>to death<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">+ and are destroyed</i> in the land</i>, their portion is in <i>eternal</i> life, and their bellies will be filled with your <i>good</i> store; children will be satisfied, and they will leave their surplus<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">profit</i> to their children.
I in truth will see your countenance, I will be satisfied <i>at the time that&lt;/i&lt;&gt;from the glory of</i> your face.

Chapter 18

For praise. About <i>the miracles that occurred to</i> the servant of the LORD, David, who sang <i>in prophecy</i> in the presence of the LORD the words of this song about all the days that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from <i>the sword of</i> Saul.
And he said: I will love you, O LORD, my strength.
O LORD, my strength and my security and the one who delivers me; <i>the God who has chosen me has brought me near to fear him;<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">to his fear</i> my shield, <i>from whose presence is given me strength and</i> redemption <i>over my enemies;</i> my security.</i>
<i>David said</i> in praise: “I pray in the LORD’s presence, and from my enemies he redeems me.”
<i>Distress</i> has surrounded me, <i>like a woman who sits on the birthstool and has no strength to give birth and so is in danger of</i> death; <i>a band of</i> abusive men has terrified me.
<i>Armies of sinners</i> have surrounded me; <i>those armed with deadly weapons</i> have confronted me.
When I am in distress, I pray in the presence of the LORD; and in the presence of my God I make supplication; and he accepts my <i>prayer</i> from his temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">from his holy temple in heaven</i> and my petition in his presence is received by his ears, <i>and is granted.</i>
The earth trembled and shook and the foundations of the mountains tottered, and split, for he was angry with it.
<i>The arrogance of Pharaoh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">+ the wicked</i> went up like smoke;<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">+ before him</i> <i>then he sent his anger</i> like a <i>burning</i> fire that consumes<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">reading מישיצייא</i> before him; his <i>rebuke</i> burns <i>at his utterance</i> like coals <i>of fire.</i>
And he bent down the heavens, and <i>his glory was manifested,</i> a <i>dark</i> cloud <i>a path before</i> him.
So he <i>was manifested in his strength</i> over <i>swift</i> cherubs; and he <i>proceeded in might</i> on the wings of the storm-wind.
And he made <i>his presence dwell</i> in the mist, and surrounded <i>himself with the clouds of his glory</i> as a covering; <i>and he made favorable rains to fall on his people, and mighty</i> waters <i>from the massed clouds of</i> darkness <i>on the wicked from the eternal</i> heights.
From the splendor <i>of his glory</i> the clouds <i>of heaven</i> passed by <i>in rebuke like</i> the coals of fire and <i>burning</i> hail <i>from his word.</i>
And the LORD <i>gave a shout</i> from heaven, and the Most High raised up his utterance; <i>he cast</i> hail and coals of fire.
And he sent <i>his word like</i> arrows, and scattered them; [he sent] many lightning bolts, and confounded them.
And the depths of the <i>sea</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">followimng 2 Sam. 22:16.</i> became visible, and the pillars of the world were uncovered at the rebuke of the LORD,78 from the <i>utterance</i> of your mighty wrath.
He sent <i>his prophets, [he who is] a mighty king who reigns in strength;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">+ on high</i> he took me [and] delivered me from many <i>Gentiles.</i>
He delivered me from my enemies, <i>for they are</i> strong; from my foes, for they prevailed <i>against</i> me.
They confronted me in the day of my <i>wandering;</i> but <i>the word of</i> the LORD was my support.
And he brought me out to a broad place, he delivered me because he was pleased with me.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">+ said David</i>
The LORD will requite me<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">repay me</i> according to my merit; according to the cleanness of my hands he will answer me.
For I have kept the <i>proper</i> ways in the LORD’s presence; and I have not <i>walked in</i> evil before the <i>LORD</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">my God</i>
For all his judgments <i>are revealed</i> in my sight, <i>to do them;</i> and his covenants I will not remove<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">or, he has not removed</i> from me.
And I was<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I will be</i> blameless in <i>fear of</i> him; and I kept <i>my soul</i> from sins.
And the LORD rewarded me according to my merit; according to the cleanness of my hands in the presence of his <i>word.</i>
With <i>Abraham, who was found</i> pious <i>in your presence,</i> you showed much mercy; with <i>his seed, Isaac, who was</i> complete <i>in fear of you,</i> you completed <i>your favorable word.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">cp. Vayiqra Rabba 11:5</i>
With <i>Jacob, who was</i> pure<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">walked in purity</i> <i>in your presence,</i> you <i>chose his sons from all the Gentiles, and separated his seed from all that is unfit; but with Pharaoh and his seed, and the Egyptians who thought evil thoughts against your people<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">+ Israel</i>, you confounded them in their thoughts.</i>
Because you are going to redeem the people, <i>the house of Israel, who are esteemed<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">needy</i> among the peoples in exile;</i> and <i>by your word</i> you will abase <i>the mighty nations who prevail over them.</i>
For you will light the lamp <i>of Israel that was extinguished in the exile, for you are the lord of the light of Israel.</i> The LORD my God will bring me out of darkness into light<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">+ and shine before me</i>; <i>he will show me his eternal consolation which is to come to the righteous.</i>
For by <i>your word</i> I will pass through armies; and by <i>the word</i> of my God I will <i>subdue mighty citadels.</i>
God [is he] whose ways are true; the <i>Torah</i> of the LORD is <i>pure</i>; he is a shield to all who trust in him.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">his word</i>
<i>For because of the miracle and deliverance that you will perform for your Messiah, and for the remnants of your people who will remain, all the Gentiles, nations, and tongues will confess and say, </i>There is no God but the LORD, <i>for there is none besides you; and your people<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"> + the house of Israel</i> will say,</i> There is none <i>mighty</i> except our God.
God, who girds on me <i>a belt</i> in strength, and makes blameless my way.
Who makes my feet<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">+ swift</i> like hinds’; and he will sustain me in my <i>stronghold.</i>
Who teaches my hands to do battle, and who makes my arms as strong as a bronze bow.
And you have given me <i>strength and</i> redemption; and your right hand will help me; and <i>by your word</i> you have multiplied me.
You have broadened<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">multiplied</i> my steps in my place, and my knee has not buckled.
I will pursue my enemies; [now] have I destroyed them, and I did not return until I finished them off.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"> and I will overtake them, and not return until I have finished them off. (The first targum assimilates the text to 2 Sam. 22:38; the second reflects the text of the psalm.)</i>
I will destroy them,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"> An assimilation to 2 Sam. 22:39</i> and they are unable to rise; and the <i>slain</i> have fallen under <i>the soles of</i> my feet.
And you have girded me with strength as a belt to do battle; you have defeated beneath me <i>the Gentiles</i> who rise up <i>to do me harm.</i>
And my foes <i>you have broken in my presence;</i> you have made them turn tail; [thus] my enemies I will destroy.
They seek help, but they have no redeemer; <i>they pray in</i> the presence of the LORD, but he does not <i>accept their prayer.</i>
I have crushed<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">trampled</i> them like <i>clods</i> of earth before the storm-wind; and like the mud of the streets I have trodden them.
You will deliver me from the discords of the Gentiles; you will keep me<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">you have appointed me</i> <i>by my destiny a benefactor</i> at the head of the Gentiles; a people that I did not know shall worship me.
At the hearing of the ear, they will obey me; the sons of the peoples<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">foreign peoples</i> will desert in my presence.
The sons of the peoples<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">see above</i> above will <i>perish,</i> and <i>will go into exile from their palaces.</i>
The LORD lives, and blessed is <i>the mighty one; for from his presence strength and redemption are given to me;</i> and exalted is God, <i>the strength of</i> my redemption.
It is God who works retribution for me, and <i>defeats</i> beneath me the Gentiles <i>who arise to do me harm.</i>
He delivers<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">redeems</i> me from my foes; indeed against those who arise <i>to do me harm</i> you will make me prevail; you will deliver me from <i>Gog and the armies of</i> rapacious Gentiles <i>with him.</i>
Because of this, I will give praise in your presence among the Gentiles, O LORD; and I will sing <i>praises</i> to your name.
He works abundant redemption with his king, and shows favor to his anointed, to David and his seed forever.

Of David, a praise. <i>Adonai</i>'s is — behold — the earth and it creatures, the land and those that dwell on it,
on account that he spaced its foundation on the seas, and on the rivers established it.
Who will ascend to the mountain of the Holy Temple of <i>Adonai</i>, and who will stand in the place of holinesses?
The pure of hand and clear of thought, who never swear on falsehood and forfeit their lives, nor vow to deceptiveness.
He will recieve blessing from before <i>Adonai</i>, and righteousness from the God who saves him.
This is the generation that will seek him out, that seeks out the good countenance of Jacob forever.
Lift up, gates of the Holy Temple, your heads, and be lifted up, eternal entrances, and the Honored King will enter.
Who is he, that Honored King? <i>Adonai</i>, strong and powerful; <i>Adonai</i>, master of power who does war.
Lift up, gates of the Garden of Eden, your heads, and be lifted up, eternal entrances, and the Honored King will enter.
Who is he, that Honored King? <i>Adonai Tsevaot</i> is the Honored King eternally.

<b>The prayer</b> that <b>Moses</b> the prophet of the LORD prayed when the people, the house of Israel, sinned in the wilderness. He raised his voice and thus he said: <b>O LORD, the dwelling</b> of whose presence is in heaven, <b>you have been for us</b> a helper <b>in every generation.</b>
When it was manifest in your presence that your people were going to sin, you established repentance; <b>before ever the mountains were</b> lifted up <b>and the earth and the world</b>’s inhabitants <b>created, and from </b>this<b> age to the age </b>to come,<b> you are God.</b>
<b>You will return a son of man to </b>death because of his sin; <b>and </b>[yet]<b> you have said, “Repent, O sons of men.”</b>
<b>For a thousand years in your eyes </b>are considered in your presence<b> like a yesterday, for it will pass; and </b>like<b> a watch in the night.</b>
And if they do not repent, death will come upon them, <b>they will be</b> as those who are <b>sleeping;</b> and in the age to come, <b>they will disappear like </b>crumbling <b>grass.</b>
Their deeds are like grass that<b> in the morning will spring up and</b> multiply; <b>in the evening it fades and dries up</b> from the heat.
<b>For we have been destroyed by your </b>harshness,<b> and by your anger<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">alternate Targum: rage</i> we have been terrified.</b>
<b>You have set our sins in front of you,</b>the iniquities of<b> our youth </b>before <b>the light of your face.</b>
<b>For all our days </b>have been removed from your presence <b>in your anger; we have completed </b>the days of our lives <b>like</b> a vapor of the mouth in winter.
<b>The days of our years</b> in this age<b> are seventy years, </b>quickly passing;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Translation uncertain.</i><b> and if </b> [one is]<b> in strength, eighty years; but most of them are toil and deceit</b> for the guilty,<b> for they pass in haste and fly away</b> to the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">alternate Targum: dust.</i>
<b>Who is he who knows </b>how to turn back <b>the force of your harshness? </b>– except the righteous, <b>who fear you, </b>appease <b>your anger.</b>
Who  <b>is right to teach us to number our days, </b>except <b>the prophet, whose heart </b>pours forth <b>wisdom?</b>
<b>Turn, O LORD – how long </b>will you afflict us? – <b>and </b>turn from the harm that you commanded to do <b>to your servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">alternate Targum: people.</i></b>
<b>Satisfy us with your goodness in</b> the age that is likened to a<b> morning, and we will rejoice and be glad in all our days.</b>
<b>Gladden us like the days that you afflicted us, </b>like<b> the years that we saw harm.</b>
<b>Let the works </b>of your miracles<b> appear to your servants, and let your splendor be upon their sons.</b>
<b>And may the pleasantness </b>of the Garden of Eden <b>be upon us </b>from the presence <b>of the LORD our God, and the works of our hands will be established by him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">some manuscripts conclude: and may the works of our hands flourish; he has firmly set the words of Torah upon us.</i></b>

Chapter 91

<b> He who</b> makes his presence abide<b> in secret is the Most High; he will lodge in the shadow of</b> the clouds of the glory of<b> Shaddai.</b>
David said: <b>“I will say to the LORD, ‘My confidence and my</b> strong<b> fortress’; my God, I will trust in</b><b> his word.”</b>
<b>For he will deliver you,</b> Solomon my son,<b>from the snare</b> and<b> the obstacle, from death </b>and<b> confusion.</b>
<b>With</b> the shelter of his presence<b> he will shelter you, and you will be confident</b> under the shelter of his glory; <b>his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.</b>
<b>Be not afraid of the terror of</b> demons who walk at<b> night, of the arrow</b> of the angel of death that he looses<b> during the day;</b>
<b>Of the</b> death<b> that walks in darkness, of</b> the band of demons<b> that attacks at noon.</b>
 You will invoke the holy name;<b>  a thousand will fall at your</b> left<b> side, and ten thousand at your right; they will not come near you</b> to do harm.
<b> Only with your eyes you will watch, and you will see the wicked </b>as they are destroyed.
Solomon answered and said: <b>“For you are my confidence, O LORD;</b> in the<b> highest </b> dwelling place<b> you have placed the house</b> of your presence.”
 The lord of the world responded and thus he said:  <b>“No harm shall happen to you; and no plague</b> or demon<b> shall come near to your tents.”</b> 
<b> For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.</b>
<b> They will lift you up by their </b> strength,<b> lest you stumble on</b> the evil impulse, which is likened to<b> the stones at your feet.</b>
<b>You will trample on</b><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Alternate targum: <b>kick</b></i><b>the </b>lions’ whelp<b> and the adder; you will tread down the lion and the viper.</b>
<b>Because he has taken pleasure in my word, and I will deliver him; I will exalt him because he knows my name.</b>
<b>He will</b> pray in my presence <b>and I will answer him; I am with him in distress, I will save him and glorify</b><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Alternate targum: <b>exalt</b></i><b> him.</b>
I will satisfy him with length of days; I will show him my redemption.

Chapter 92

<b>A psalm and <b>song</b> that the first Adam uttered concerning <b>the Sabbath day.</b></b>
<b>It is good to give thanks in the presence of the Lord, and to praise your name, O Most High.</b>
<b>To recount your goodness in the morning, and your truth in the nights,</b>
<b>According to the</b> harp of <b>ten </b>strings, <b>and according to the lyre, upon the murmuring of harps.</b>
<b>For you have made me glad, O Lord, by your works; I will rejoice in the works of your hands.</b>
<b>How great are your works, O Lord; your thoughts are very deep.</b>
<b>A foolish son of man will not know it, and a fool will not comprehend this.</b>
<b>While the wicked flourish like grass and all workers of deceit blossom, </b>God <b>is going to destroy them forever.</b>
<b>But you are high </b>and supreme <b>in </b>this <b>age, O LORD, </b>and you are high and supreme in the age to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Another Targum: <b>And you, </b>your hand is <b>supreme </b>to punish the wicked <b>in the age </b>to come, in the great day of judgment, O LORD; and you, your hand is supreme to give a good reward to the righteous in the age to come, <b>O LORD.</b> </i> 
<b>For, behold, your enemies,</b> <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">many targumim continue: prosper in this age; </i> O LORD, for behold, your enemies will perish in the age to come; <b>and all the workers of deceit will be separated</b> from the band of the righteous.
<b>You have raised up my </b>might <b>like a wild-ox; you have </b>anointed <b>me with </b>moist anointing <b>oil of the leafy olive.</b>
<b>And my eye has looked on </b>the perdition of <b>my oppressors; my ear has heard </b>the sound of the destruction of <b>those who stand against me to do harm.</b>
<b>The righteous man will grow </b>fruit <b>like the palm-tree, like the cedar in Lebanon he will grow </b>and produce roots.
His sons will be <b>planted in the sanctuary of the Lord; in the court of the house of our God they will flourish.</b>
<b>Again </b>like their fathers <b>they will </b>produce sons <b>in old age; they will be plump and juicy.</b>
<b>So that </b>the inhabitants of the earth <b>might tell it, for the Lord is upright; my </b>strength,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">many targumim read: mighty one;</i> <b>and there is no wrong in him.</b>

<b>Bless, O my soul, </b>the name of<b> the LORD. O LORD my God, you are greatly exalted; you have put on praise and splendor.</b> 
<b>Who wraps himself in light like a sheet, who stretches out the heavens like a curtain.</b>
<b>Who covers his chambers with water </b>like a building with beams;<b> who placed his chariot</b>, as it were,<b> upon swift clouds; who goes on the wings of </b>an eagle.
<b>Who made his messengers </b>as swift as<b> wind; his servants, </b>as strong as<b> burning fire.</b>
<b>Who lays the foundation of the earth upon its base, so that it will not shake for ages upon ages.</b>
<b>You have covered over the abyss as with a garment; and the waters </b>split<b> on the mountains, </b>and<b> endure.</b>
<b>At your rebuke, they will flee, </b>flowing down;<b> at the sound of your shout, they will be frightened, </b>pouring themselves out.
<b>They will go up </b>from the abyss<b> to the mountains, </b>and<b> descend to the valleys, to this place </b>that<b> you founded for them.</b>
<b>You have placed a boundary </b>for the waves of the sea<b> that they will not cross, </b>lest<b> they return to cover the earth.</b>
<b>Who releases springs into rivers; they flow between the mountains.</b>
<b>They water all the wild animals; the asses will break their thirst.</b>
<b>The birds of heaven will settle on them; they will give out a sound </b>of singing<b> from among the branches.</b>
Who<b> waters the mountains from his </b>upper treasury;<b> the earth will be satisfied with the fruit of your deeds.</b>
Who<b> makes grass grow for beasts, and herbs for the cultivation of </b>the son of<b> man, that bread may come forth from the earth;</b>
<b>And wine </b>that<b> gladdens the heart of </b>the son of<b> man, to make the face shine by oil; and bread will support the heart of </b>the son of<b> man.</b>
<b>The trees </b>that<b> the LORD </b>created<b> are satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted:</b>
<b>Where the birds make nests; the stork’s dwelling is in the cypresses.</b>
<b>The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are security for the conies.</b>
<b>He made the moon </b>to calculate<b> times </b>by; the sun knows the time of<b> his setting.</b>
<b>You will make darkness and it will be night; in it all the beasts of the forest creep about.</b>
<b>The </b>offspring of<b> lions roar </b>to find<b> food, and to seek their sustenance from God.</b>
<b>The sun will shine, they gather together; and they lay down in their dwelling place.</b>
<b>A </b>son of<b> man will go forth to his work and to his cultivation, until </b>the sunset of<b> evening.</b>
<b>How many are your works, O LORD! You have made all of them in wisdom; the earth is full of your possessions.</b>
<b>This sea is great and broad in extent; creeping things are there without number, both tiny creatures and large.</b>
<b>There the ships go about, </b>and<b> this Leviathan you created for the sport </b>of the righteous at the supper of his dwelling place.
<b>All of them rely on you to give their food in its time.</b>
<b>You will give it to them, </b>and<b> they gather it; you will open your hand, </b>and<b> they are satisfied with goodness.</b>
<b>You will </b>remove your presence,<b> they are dazed; you will gather their spirit </b>and<b> they expire, and return to their dust.</b>
<b>You will send out your </b>holy<b> spirit </b>and<b> they are created; and you will make new the surface of the earth.</b>
<b>May the glory of the LORD be eternal; the LORD will rejoice in his works.</b>
<b>Who looks at the earth, and it shakes; he draws near to the mountains, and they </b>emit<b> smoke.</b>
<b>I will sing praise in the presence of the LORD during my life; I will make music to my God while I exist.</b>
<b>May my talk be pleasing in his presence; I will rejoice in </b>the word of<b> the LORD.</b>
<b>The sinners will be destroyed from the earth, and wicked exist no longer. Bless, O my soul, </b>the name of<b> the LORD. Hallelujah!</b>

The boy the builders rejected; he was among the sons of Jesse and he was privileged to be appointed as king and ruler.
"This is from YHWH," said the builders; "It is marvelous before us," said the sons of Jesse.
"This is the day YHWH made [or acted]," said the builders; "Let us rejoice and be glad in it," said the sons of Jesse.
"Please, from you, O YHWH, now!" said the builders; "Please, from you, O YHWH, cause [us] to prosper, now!" said Jesse and his wife.
"Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the word of YHWH," said [the] builders; "They bless you from the house of the sanctuary of YHWH," said David.
"YHWH is God; he caused [light] to shine for us," said the tribes of the house of Judah; "Bind the lamb for the sacrifice of the feast with ropes until you offer him and you sprinkle his blood on the horns of the altar," said Samuel the prophet.

The song that is said on the ascents from the abyss. Before <i>Adonai</i>, when I was distressed, I prayed, and He received my prayer.
 <i>Adonai</i> saves my soul from the lips of falsehood, from the deceitful tongue.
What will it give you, badmouther, and what benefit to you, informant, is the deceitful tongue?
Sharp arrows of a warrior, like lightning above, with coals of broom wood that burn in hell below.
Woe is me, since I am made to live with the Asians, to dwell in the tents of the Arabs!
Too long has my soul lived with Edom, hater of peace.
I am peace, and since I pray they go to war.

Chapter 121

The song that is said on the ascents from the abyss. I raise up my eyes to the mountains — from where comes my help?
My help is from before <i>Adonai</i>, who made the heaven and earth.
He will not make your feet totter, unsleeping is your Guardian.
Behold — unsleeping and unresting is the guardian of Israel.
<i>Adonai</i> will guard you. <i>Adonai</i> will cast shade upon you on account of the mezuzah that is affixed to the right side of your entrance. 
In the day, when the sun rules, the zephyrs will not strike you; nor the lilin, when the moon rules in the night.
The word of <i>Adonai</i> will guard you from all evil, will guard your soul.
<i>Adonai</i>  will guard your going out to business and your going in to engage in Torah from now and until forever.

Chapter 122

The song that is said on the ascents from the abyss. I rejoiced when they were saying to me, "To the Holy Temple of <i>Adonai</i> let us go!"
Our feet were standing in your gates, Jerusalem!
Jerusalem that is built in the firmament is like the city that is joined with it as one on earth.
That there went up the tribes, tribes of <i>Adonai</i>, testifying to Israel that His Presence dwells among them, to make them go to thank the name of <i>Adonai</i>.
Because there were installed thrones in Jerusalem: thrones in the Holy Temple of the kings of the house of David.
Ask peace for Jerusalem, may those who love you dwell in security.
May there be peace in your walls, security in your citadels.
On account of my brothers and by friends, I will speak now of peace in you.
For the temple of  <i>Adonai</i> our God, I seek good for you.

Chapter 123

The song that is said on the ascents from the abyss. Before You I lift my eyes — You who are seated on a glorious throne in heaven.
Behold, just as slaves' eyes gaze at the leftovers from their owners' hands, and just as maids' eyes gaze at the leftovers from their mistresses' hands, so too our eyes gaze at before <i>Adonai</i> our God, until when He has mercy on us.
Have mercy on us, <i>Adonai</i>, have mercy on us, because we are exceedingly sated with contempt.
So much, our souls are sated with ridicule from those living at ease, the haughty and proud!
