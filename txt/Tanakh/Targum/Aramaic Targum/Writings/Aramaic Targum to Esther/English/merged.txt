Aramaic Targum to Esther



Chapter 1







And he ordered to have them given their drink in golden vessels from the Temple that the evil Nevukhadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem; and they would exchange the other vessels that Ahasuerus had there for the value of lead in view of the exceptional vessels of the Temple. And they would drink rich wine in quantities commensurate for the party of a king, the smell of which was great and the taste firm. And there was no lack, but it was rather like that which is fitting the hand of the king.

Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4












And when the evil Haman saw Hatach, whose real name was Daniel, going out towards Esther, his anger overcame him and he killed him. The angels Michael and Gabriel were summoned, and it was they who brought Esther's message to Mordechai.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6



Chapter 7


And the king said to Esther also on the second day during the wine party, "What is your query, Queen Esther, and it shall be given to you; what is your request - I would even give you up to half of the kingdom, except for building the Temple which stands in the middle of the holdings of my kingdom. That I would not give you, for how then would I keep my oath to Geshem, Toviah and Sanballat? However wait until Darius your son grows up and inherits the kingdom; [then] he shall do it."
