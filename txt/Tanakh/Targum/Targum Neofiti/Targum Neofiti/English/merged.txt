Targum Neofiti



Chapter 1

In the beginning and in great wisdom, God created and finished the heavens and the earth.
And the earth was void and formless, desolate from humans and animals alike. It was empty of all planted vegetation and trees. Darkness was spread on the surface of the depths, and a merciful spirit from before God blew across the water.
And God said: Let there be light, and there was light as he commanded.
God saw that the light was good, and he separated (by word) between light and dark.
And God called the light day, and to the dark he called night, and it was day and night; the first day of the Genesis order.
And God said: Let there be a separation in the middle of the waters, and there was a separation between the earth-waters and the heaven-waters.
And God created the separation, which separated the water below the line of separation and the water above the line of separation, and it was thus as his word.
And God called the separation "Heavens," and it was day and night, the second day of the Genesis order.
