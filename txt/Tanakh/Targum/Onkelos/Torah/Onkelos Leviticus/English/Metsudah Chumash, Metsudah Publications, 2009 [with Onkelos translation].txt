Onkelos Leviticus



Chapter 1

And He called to Moshe, and Adonoy spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting, saying:
Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them; [if] a man among you will bring an offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy; of animals, cattle or sheep you should bring your offering.
If his offering is a burnt-offering of cattle he shall bring an unblemished male; to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he shall bring it, that it be favorably accepted from him before Adonoy.
He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt-offering and it will be favorably accepted from him to achieve his atonement.
He shall slaughter the calf before Adonoy and the sons of Aharon, the <i>kohanim,</i> will bring the blood and they will sprinkle the blood all around the altar, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
He shall skin the burnt-offering and cut it into its pieces [<b>limbs</b>].
The sons of Aharon the <i>kohein</i> shall place [ignite] a fire on the altar and they shall arrange logs on the fire.
The sons of Aharon, the <i>kohanim,</i> shall arrange the pieces [<b>limbs</b>], the head and the fat on the logs which are on the fire that is on the altar.
He shall wash its innards and its legs in water; and the <i>kohein</i> shall burn it all on the altar [for the purpose of] a burnt-offering, a fire-offering [<b>an offering</b>] of pleasing fragrance to [<b>which is accepted with favor before</b>] Adonoy.
If his offering is from flocks of sheep—of lambs or of goats—for a burnt-offering, he shall bring an unblemished male.
He shall slaughter it on the north side of the altar before Adonoy; and the sons of Aharon, the <i>kohanim,</i> will sprinkle its blood all around the altar.
He shall sever it into its pieces [<b>limbs</b>]—and its head, and [remove] its fats; and the <i>kohein</i> shall arrange them on the logs which are on the fire that is on the altar.
He shall wash the innards and feet in water and the <i>kohein</i> shall bring it all and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt-offering; a fire-offering [<b>an offering</b>] of pleasing fragrance to [<b>which is accepted with favor before</b>] Adonoy.
If his burnt-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy is of fowl, he shall bring either turtledoves or the young pigeons [as] his offering.
The <i>kohein</i> shall bring it near the altar and nip off its head [with his fingernail] and burn it on the altar; and its blood shall be squeezed out onto the wall of the altar.
He shall remove its crop [together] with its feathers [<b>excrement</b>] and throw it beside the altar, eastward, to the place of [<b>where they throw</b>] the ashes.
He shall rip it apart by its wings, not completely dividing it. The <i>kohein</i> shall burn it on the altar, on the logs which are on the fire; it is a burnt-offering, a fire-offering [<b>an offering</b>] of pleasing fragrance to [<b>which is accepted with favor before</b>] Adonoy.

Chapter 2

When a person brings a meal-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, his offering shall be of fine flour; he shall pour oil upon it and place frankincense upon it.
He shall bring it to the sons of Aharon, the <i>kohanim</i>; from there, [a <i>kohein</i>] takes his fistful—from its flour and oil—with all its frankincense. The <i>kohein</i> shall burn its memorial portion on the altar, a fire-offering [<b>an offering</b>] of pleasing fragrance to [<b>which is accepted with favor before</b>] Adonoy.
Whatever remains of the meal-offering belongs to Aharon and his sons; [it is] holy of holies of the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy.
And when you bring a meal-offering that has been baked in an oven, [it shall be unleavened] matzoh-loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or [unleavened] matzoh wafers smeared with oil.
If your offering is a pan-baked meal offering, it shall be of fine flour mixed with oil; it shall be [unleavened] matzoh.
Break it into pieces and pour oil on it; it is a meal-offering.
If your offering is a deep-pan [<b>which appears as if it has been ploughed out</b>] meal offering, you shall make it with fine flour and oil.
You shall bring the meal-offering that will be made in any of the aforementioned ways to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. He shall bring it to the <i>kohein</i> and he will present it to the altar.
The <i>kohein</i> shall separate from the meal-offering its memorial portion and burn it on the altar, a fire-offering [<b>an offering</b>] of pleasing fragrance to [<b>which is accepted with favor before</b>] Adonoy.
Whatever remains of the meal-offering belongs to Aharon and his sons; [it is] holy of holies [most holy] of the fire-offering [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy.
All meal-offerings that you bring to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy are not to be made leavened, because all sourdough and all honey you shall not burn from them a fire-offering to [<b>an offering before</b>] Adonoy.
You shall bring them as a first [fruit-]offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy but they shall not go up [be placed atop] the altar as a pleasing fragrance [<b>to be accepted with favor</b>].
You shall salt all your meal-offerings with salt and you shall not omit salt, the covenant of your God from [being placed] upon your meal-offerings. You shall bring salt on every one of your offerings.
When you bring a meal-offering of first grains to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, of newly ripened crops, roasted over fire, ground [full and moist] [<b>soft</b>] kernels, you shall bring your first grain meal-offering.
You shall put oil on it and place frankincense upon it; it is a meal-offering.
The <i>kohein</i> shall burn its memorial portion of its ground flour and of its oil and all of its frankincense; [it is] a fire-offering to [<b>an offering before</b>] Adonoy.

Chapter 4

And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:
Speak to Bnei Yisroel, saying; if a person unwittingly transgresses any commandment of Adonoy which should [<b>is</b>] not [<b>fitting to</b>] be done and commits one of these sins.
If the anointed <i>kohein</i> [<b>gadol</b>] should sin to bring guilt on the people, he shall bring for his sin which he committed a young, unblemished bullock to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, as a sin-offering.
He shall bring the bullock to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before Adonoy. He shall lay his hand on the head of the bullock and slaughter the bullock before Adonoy.
The anointed <i>kohein</i> [<b>gadol</b>] shall take some of the bullocks blood and bring it inside the Tent of Meeting.
The <i>kohein</i> shall dip his finger into the blood and he shall sprinkle from the blood seven times, before Adonoy, in front of the Holy Curtain.
The <i>kohein</i> shall put from the blood atop the corners of the spice-burning altar before Adonoy, which is inside the Tent of Meeting. He shall spill all the [remaining] bullocks blood into the base of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
All the fat of the sin-offering bullock he shall separate from it; the fat covering the innards, all the fat on the innards,
the two kidneys and the fat on them that are on the flanks. The lobe on the liver, he shall remove together with the kidneys,
in the same manner as they were separated from the ox of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering. The <i>kohein</i> shall burn them on the altar of the burnt-offering.
The bullocks skin, all its flesh with its head and feet, its innards and its waste [that is in its intestines].
He shall take out the entire bullock beyond the encampment, to a pure [undefiled] place, [<b>to the place</b>] where the ashes are thrown and burn it on logs, in a fire. It shall be burned [<b>at the place</b>] where the ashes are thrown.
If the entire congregation of Yisroel erred and the matter [that error] was concealed from the eyes of the community, and they did [transgress] one of the commandments of Adonoy that should [<b>is</b>] not [<b>fitting to</b>] be done, they incur guilt.
[When] they realize the sin which they committed, the community shall bring a young bullock as a sin-offering and they shall bring it to the front of the Tent of Meeting.
The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bullock, before Adonoy and he shall slaughter the bullock before Adonoy.

He shall take the bullock outside, beyond the encampment, and burn it in the same manner as he burned the first bullock; it is a communal sin-offering.
If a leader sins, [who] transgresses one of the commandments of Adonoy, his God, that should [<b>is</b>] not [<b>fitting to</b>] be done, [if he transgressed] unwittingly and incurs guilt.
Or, [if his sin] becomes known to him—[that] which he committed. He shall bring as his offering an unblemished, male goat.

The <i>kohein</i> shall take some blood from the sin-offering with his finger and put it atop the corners of the altar of the burnt-offering. He shall spill all its [remaining] blood into the base of the altar.
He shall remove all its fat in the same manner as was removed the fat of the lamb of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering. The <i>kohein</i> shall burn them on the altar on the fires [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy. The <i>kohein</i> will atone for him, for his sin which he committed and he will be pardoned.

Chapter 5

If a person sins, and heard an oath [demanding his testimony] [in a case where] he is a witness; [for] he either saw or knew [something relevant], if he does not testify, he will bear [the burden of] his iniquity.
Or, if a person touches anything impure either the carcass of an impure wild animal, or the carcass of an impure animal of pasture, or the carcass of an impure creeping animal; and this [impurity] was concealed from him, he is impure and incurs guilt.
Or, if he touches the impurities of man whatever that impurity may be that causes impurity and this [impurity] was concealed from him; [when] he realizes [he is impure], he incurs guilt.
Or, if a person swears, orally expressing to do harm [that he will do something which is to his detriment] or to do good [that he will do something that is to his benefit]. Regarding all a person will expresses in an oath and [that oath] was concealed from himself, when he realizes [his sin] and he incurs guilt, for any one of these [aforementioned sins].
It shall be that when he incurs guilt for any of these [aforementioned sins] he shall confess that which he transgressed.
He shall bring his guilt-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy for his sin that he committed a female of the sheep, a lamb or a she-goat as a sin-offering. The <i>kohein</i> will atone for him, for his sin.
If his means are not sufficient for [the acquisition of] a sheep, then he shall bring for his guilt-offering,—[he] who has sinned,—two turtledoves or two young pigeons to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy one for a sin-offering and one for a burnt-offering.
He shall bring them to the <i>kohein</i> and he shall bring that which is for a sin-offering first. He [the <i>kohein</i>] shall shear its head [with his fingernail] opposite of its neck, but not separate [the head] completely.
He shall sprinkle some blood of the sin-offering on to the wall of the altar. And the remaining blood shall be squeezed into the base of the altar; it is a sin-offering.
He shall do (offer) the second [turtledove pigeon] as a burnt-offering, as prescribed. The <i>kohein</i> will atone from him, for his sin that he committed and he will be pardoned.
If his means are not sufficient for the acquisition of two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he shall bring as his offering,—[he] who has sinned,—one tenth of an epha [<b>which is three se’in</b>] of fine flour as a sin-offering. He shall not put oil upon it, nor shall he place frankincense upon it, for it is a sin-offering.
He shall bring it to the <i>kohein</i> and the <i>kohein</i> shall take a fistful from it [as] its memorial portion and burn it on the altar on the fires [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy; it is a sin-offering.
The <i>kohein</i> will atone for him, for his sin that he committed in one of these [three] ways and he will be pardoned. [The remaining portion] shall belong to the <i>kohein</i> as a meal-offering.
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;
If a person wrongfully deviates [<b>lies</b>] and unwittingly sins [by using the] sacred property of Adonoy, he shall bring his guilt-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, an unblemished ram, from the sheep, based on the valuation of holy silver shekalim [<b>selaim</b>], for a guilt-offering.
That which he sinned [making use] of the sacred property, he shall pay for and add an additional fifth to that [amount] and give it to the <i>kohein.</i> The <i>kohein</i> will atone for him with the guilt-offering ram and he will be pardoned.
If a person sins and did [transgress] one of the commandments of Adonoy that should [<b>is</b>] not [<b>fitting to</b>] be done, [however,] he is uncertain [that he sinned], and he [nevertheless] incurs guilt and will bear [the burden of] his iniquity.
He shall bring an unblemished ram, from the sheep, based on the valuation as a guilt-offering, to the <i>kohein.</i> The <i>kohein</i> will atone for him, for the error which he did unintentionally, and he did not know, and he will be pardoned.
It is a guilt-offering [for] he certainly incurred guilt [<b>for his sin which he committed he shall bring a guilt-offering</b>] before Adonoy.
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;
If a person sins and wrongfully deviates [<b>lies</b>] from [<b>before</b>] Adonoy and denies to his friend the possession of a keepsake placed in his trust or, a deposit [regarding money that was loaned or in partnership,] or theft [claiming that something was stolen,] or, oppressed [he withheld wages from] his friend.
Or, if he found a lost item and denies it and swears falsely in any of all these [aforementioned instances], whatever someone will do to sin in these instances.
It shall be that when he [realizes his] sin and incurs guilt, he shall return the stolen property that he stole, or, the wages that he withheld or, whatever keepsake that was placed in his trust or, the lost item which he found.
Or, anything about which he will swear falsely. He shall pay its price and add an additional fifth to that [amount] to whomever that object belongs he shall give it on the day of his guilt-offering.
He shall bring his guilt-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy an unblemished ram, from the sheep based on the valuation, as a guilt-offering to the <i>kohein.</i>
The <i>kohein</i> will atone for him before Adonoy and he will be pardoned for anything that he will do through which guilt incurs.

Chapter 6

And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:
Command Aharon and his sons, saying; this is the law of the burnt-offering. It is the burnt-offering [which remains] on its pyre on the altar all night, until the morning, and the fire of the altar will be kept burning on it.
The <i>kohein</i> shall dress in his linen garment and he shall wear linen pants on his [body] skin; and he shall separate the ashes when the fire consumes the burnt-offering on the altar and place it next to the altar.
He shall [then] remove his garments and dress in other garments. He shall take out the ashes beyond the encampment, to a pure [undefiled] place.
The fire on the altar shall be kindled with it it shall not go out. The <i>kohein</i> shall burn logs upon it each and every morning and arrange the burnt-offering on it and burn upon it the fats of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering.
A continual fire shall be lit on the altar; it shall not go out.
This is the law of the meal-offering. The sons of Aharon bring it before Adonoy, to the front of the altar.
He shall separate from it, when he takes his fistful, from some of the meal-offerings fine flour and some of its oil and all the frankincense which is on the meal-offering. He shall burn, on the altar a pleasing fragrance [<b>to be accepted with favor</b>]; its memorial portion, to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
Whatever remains from it shall be eaten by Aharon and his sons. It must be eaten as <i>matzoh,</i> in a sacred place. In the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it.
It should not be baked [as] leavened. I have given it to them as their portion from my fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>]. It is holy of holies [most holy], as [are] the sin-offering and as the guilt-offering.
Every male descendant of Aharon may eat it, an everlasting statute for all your descendants from the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy. whatever shall touch them will become sacred.
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:
This is the offering of Aharon and his sons that they shall offer to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy on the day that he is anointed [<b>inaugurated to greatness</b>]; one tenth of an <i>ephah</i> [<b>which is three se’in</b>] of fine flour as a meal-offering, always [daily]. Half of it [he shall offer] in the morning and half of it [he shall offer] in the evening.
In a frying pan, with oil it shall be made; you shall bring it saturated, well-baked, a meal-offering of broken pieces, you shall bring a pleasing fragrance to [<b>it to be accepted with favor before</b>] Adonoy.
The <i>kohein</i> who is anointed [<b>inaugurated to greatness</b>] in his stead from among his sons, he shall [also] do it; an everlasting statute to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, it shall be entirely burnt.
Every meal-offering of a <i>kohein</i> shall be completely burnt and may not be eaten.
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:
Speak to Aharon and his sons, saying: this is the law of the sin-offering. In the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered, the sin-offering shall be slaughtered, before Adonoy; it is holy of holies [most holy].
The <i>kohein</i> who offers it as a sin-offering [<b>atones with its blood</b>], shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a sacred place, in the Courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
Whatever shall touch its flesh shall become holy and when of its blood is sprinkled on the garment, whatever it is sprinkled upon, you shall wash in a sacred place.
An earthenware vessel in which it was cooked, must be broken. If it was cooked in a copper vessel, it must be scoured and rinsed with water.
Every male among the <i>kohanim</i> may eat it; it is holy of holies [=most holy].
Every sin-offering whose blood is to be brought inside the Tent of Meeting to bring about atonement inside the Sanctuary may not be eaten; it must be burned in fire.

Chapter 7

This is the law of the guilt-offering; it is holy of holies [=most holy].
In the place where they will slaughter the burnt-offering they shall slaughter the guilt-offering, and they shall sprinkle its blood all around the altar.
He shall bring [<b>separate</b>] all its fat from it; the [fat] tail, the fat covering the innards,
the two kidneys and the fat on them that are on the flanks. The lobe on the liver, he shall remove together with the kidneys.
The <i>kohein</i> shall burn them on the altar, a fire-offering to [<b>an offering before</b>] Adonoy; it is a guilt-offering.
All males among the <i>kohanim</i> may eat it. It must be eaten in a sacred place; it is most holy.
As the sin-offering is, so is the guilt-offering; one law applies to them both; the <i>kohein</i> who will bring about atonement with it, it shall belong to him.
The <i>kohein</i> who brings a burnt-offering of an individual, the skin of the burnt-offering that he brought, shall belong to the <i>kohein,</i> it shall belong to him.
Every meal-offering that shall be baked in an oven and every one made in a deep pot [<b>which appears as if it has been ploughed out</b>] or frying pan, [belong] to the <i>kohein</i> who offers it; it shall belong to him.
Every meal-offering mixed with oil or dry [<b>not mixed</b>], shall belong to all the sons of Aharon, each equally.
This is the law of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering that one will bring to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
If he brings it as thanksgiving offering he shall bring along with his thanksgiving offering <i>matzoh</i> [unleavened] loaves mixed with oil, <i>matzoh</i> [unleavened] wafers anointed with oil and loaves of saturated fine flour mixed with oil.
With loaves of leavened bread he shall bring his offering, along with his peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering of thanksgiving.
From it, he shall bring one from each offering as separated portion to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy. To that <i>kohein</i> who sprinkles the blood of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering, it shall belong to him.
The flesh of his thanksgiving peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering on the day of its sacrifice it may be eaten. He shall not leave over any of it until morning.
If either a vow or a voluntary offering, are the sacrifices of his offerings, it shall be eaten on the day of his offering. And on the next day, the remnant of it may [also] be eaten.
Whatever flesh is left over from the offering shall be burned in fire, on the third day.
If it will be eaten, of the flesh of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering on the third day, it will not be favorably accepted. [As to] whoever brings it, it will not be credited to him; it is an abomination [<b>rejected</b>] and anyone who eats of it shall bear [the burden of] its iniquity.
The flesh [of [<b>the sacred</b>] offerings] that will touch any unclean [thing] may not be eaten; it shall be burned in fire. [As to] the [pure] [<b>sacred</b>] flesh, every [ritually] pure person [<b>fitting for the sacred</b>] may eat [the] [<b>sacred</b>] meat.
The person who eats of the flesh of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering belonging to [<b>which is before</b>] Adonoy while his uncleaness is yet on him, that persons soul shall be cut off from its people.
A person who touches anything unclean, be it the impurities of man or an unclean animal, or any unclean creeping creature and then eats some flesh of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering belonging to [<b>which is before</b>] Adonoy, that persons soul shall be cut off from its people.
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:
Speak to Bnei Yisroel, saying: any fat of oxen, sheep or goats you must not eat.
The fat of an improperly slaughtered animal and the fat of a fatally wounded animal may be used for any purpose, but you are surely not permitted to eat it.
For, anyone who eats fat of an animal from which is offered a fire-offering to [<b>as offering before</b>] Adonoy, the soul [<b>person</b>] who ate it shall be cut off from its people.
You shall not eat any blood, in all your dwelling places, be it of fowl or of beast.
Any person who eats any blood, that soul [<b>person</b>] shall be cut off from its people.
And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:
Speak to Bnei Yisroel, saying: Whoever shall bring the sacrifice of his peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, he shall bring his offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy from his peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering.
His hands shall bring the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy; he shall bring the fat on the breast and the breast [itself] to wave [<b>lift</b>] them [<b>up</b>] as a wave-offering [<b>an uplifted-offering</b>] before Adonoy.
The <i>kohein</i> shall burn the fat on the altar and the breast shall belong to Aharon and to his sons.
The right thigh you shall give as a separated portion to the <i>kohein,</i> from your peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offerings.
Whoever offers the blood of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering and the fat who is of the sons of Aharon, the right thigh shall belong to him as a portion.
Because the breast wave[<b>uplifted</b>]-offering and the thigh [that is] the uplifted [<b>separated</b>] portion I have taken from Bnei Yisroel. from their peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offerings and I have given them to Aharon the <i>kohein</i> and to his sons, as an everlasting statute, from Bnei Yisroel.
This is [for] the anointing [<b>inauguration to greatness</b>] of Aharon and [for] the anointing [<b>inauguration to greatness</b>] of his sons from the fire-offering [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy, on the day He brought them to serve before Adonoy,
that Adonoy commanded to give to them, on the day He anointed [<b>inaugurated</b>] them [<b>to greatness</b>], from Bnei Yisroel, an everlasting statute for all their descendants.
This is the law for the burnt-offering, the meal-offering, the sin-offering and the guilt-offering; for the installation-sacrifices [<b>sacrifices</b>] and for the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering,
that Adonoy commanded Moshe on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded Bnei Yisroel to bring their offerings to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy in the desert of Sinai.

Chapter 8

And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, to say:
Take [<b>Bring</b>] Aharon [<b>near</b>], along with his sons, the garments, the anointing oil [<b>of inaugurating to greatness</b>], the bull for the sin-offering, the two rams and a basket of <i>matzos</i>.
Assemble the entire congrega-tion at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
Moshe did that which Adonoy commanded him and the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
Moshe said to the congregation, This is the edict that Adonoy commanded to do.
Moshe brought Aharon and his sons near and bathed them in water.
He placed the tunic on him, girded him with the sash, dressed him in the robe, placed the <i>ephod</i> on him girded him with the <i>ephod</i>-sash and tightened it for him.
He put the breastplate on him and he placed in the breastplate the <i>urim</i> and the <i>tumim.</i>
He placed the turban on his head and he placed, on the front of the turban, the golden plate, the crown of holiness, just as Adonoy commanded Moshe.
Moshe took the anointing-oil [<b>of inaugurating to greatness</b>] and anointed [<b>inaugurated</b>] the Tabernacle [<b>to greatness</b>] and everything inside it and sanctified them.
He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times; he anointed [<b>inaugurated to greatness</b>] the altar and all its utensils, the washing basin and its base, to sanctify them.
He poured some of the anointing-oil [<b>which inaugurates to greatness</b>] on Aharons head and anointed [<b>inaugurated</b>] him [<b>to greatness</b>], to sanctify him.
Moshe brought near the sons of Aharon and dressed them in tunics, girded them with sashes, and tied high turbans for them [to wear], just as Adonoy commanded Moshe.
He brought near the sin-offering bullock and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the sin-offering bullock.
He slaughtered it; and Moshe took the blood and put it atop the corners of the altar all around with his finger and he purified the altar. He poured the blood into the base of the altar and sanctified it, to atone upon it.
He took all the fat on the innards, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and their fats and Moshe burned [them] on the altar.
The bullock, its skin, its flesh and its waste [that are in its intestines], he burned in fire, beyond the encampment, just as Adonoy commanded Moshe.
He brought the burnt-offering ram and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the rams head.
He slaughtered it; and Moshe sprinkled the blood all around the altar.
He severed the rams limbs; and Moshe burned the head and the severed limbs and the fat.
He washed the innards and feet in water; and Moshe burned the entire ram on the altar. It is a burnt-offering; for a pleasing fragrance [<b>to be accepted with favor</b>], a fire-offering to [<b>an offering before</b>] Adonoy, just as Adonoy commanded Moshe.
He brought the second ram, the ram for the installation-offering [<b>offerings</b>]; and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the rams head.
He slaughtered it; and Moshe took some of its blood and he put it on [<b>the upper part of</b>] Aharons right earlobe [<b>ear</b>], on the thumb of his right hand and the big toe of his right foot.
He brought the sons of Aharon; and Moshe put some blood on [<b>the upper part of</b>] their right earlobes [<b>ears</b>] and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Moshe sprinkled the blood all around the altar.
He took the fat and the fat tail, all the fat on the innards, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and their fats and the right thigh.
From the basket of <i>matzos</i> which [was] before Adonoy he took one <i>matzoh</i> loaf, one oil-bread and one wafer and he placed them on the fats and on the right thigh.
He put them all on Aharons palms and on the palms of his sons and he waved [<b>lifted</b>] them [<b>up</b>] as a wave-offering [<b>an uplifted-offering</b>] before Adonoy.
Moshe took them from their palms and he burned them on the altar in addition to the burnt-offering; they are installation-offerings for a pleasing fragrance [<b>offerings to be accepted with favor</b>], it is a fire-offering to [<b>an offering before</b>] Adonoy.
Moshe took the breast and waved [<b>lifted</b>] it [<b>up</b>] [as] a wave-offering [<b>an uplifted-offering</b>] before Adonoy. From the ram for the installation-offering [<b>offerings</b>]—that was the portion of Moshe—just as Adonoy commanded Moshe.
Moshe took some anointing-oil [<b>which inaugurates to greatness</b>] and some blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aharon, on his garments, and on his sons and on his sons garments with him. He sanctified Aharon and his garments and his sons and his sons garments with him.
Moshe said to Aharon and to his sons Cook the flesh at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and you shall eat it there [with] the bread that is in the installation basket [<b>of sacrifices</b>] just as I commanded, saying; Aharon and his sons shall eat them.
Whatever flesh and bread is left over, you shall burn them in fire.
From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not go out for seven days until the time that your days of installation [<b>sacrifices</b>] are complete, because for seven days your hands [<b>sacrifices</b>] will be filled [<b>offered</b>].
Just as you have done on this day, Adonoy commanded him to do, to bring about atonement.
At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall sit day and night for seven days and keep the charge of [<b>the Word of</b>] Adonoy and you will not die, because I have been thus commanded.
Aharon and his sons fulfilled all the edicts that Adonoy commanded through Moshe.

Chapter 9

And it was on the eight day [that] Moshe called to Aharon and to his sons and to the elders of Israel.
He said to Aharon, Take, for yourself, a young calf, for a sin-offering and a ram—for a burnt-offering—unblemished ones, and bring them before Adonoy.
To Bnei Yisroel you shall speak, saying, take a he-goat, for a sin-offering and a calf and a lamb, both one year old—unblemished—for a burnt-offering,
an ox and a ram for a peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering, to sacrifice before Adonoy and a meal-offering mixed with oil, for today, [<b>the Glory of</b>] Adonoy will appear [<b>become revealed</b>] to you.
They took that which Moshe commanded, before the Tent of Meeting; and the entire congregation approached and they stood before Adonoy.
Moshe said: This is what Adonoy commanded you to do: and the glory of Adonoy will appear [<b>become revealed</b>] to you.
Moshe said to Aharon: Approach the altar and perform [the services of] your sin-offering and your burnt-offering and atone on your [own] behalf and on behalf of the people; and perform [the service of] the peoples offering and atone on their behalf, just as Adonoy commanded.
Aharon approached the altar and slaughtered the calf that he had for a sin-offering.
Aharons sons brought the blood to him and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it atop the corners of the altar and he poured the [remaining] blood into the base of the altar.
The fat, kidneys and the lobe of the liver from the sin-offering, he burned on the altar, just as Adonoy commanded Moshe.
The flesh and the skin, he burned in a fire beyond the encampment.
He slaughtered the burnt-offering; and Aharons sons presented the blood to him, and he sprinkled it all around the altar.
They presented the burnt-offering to him with its limbs severed and [with] the head, and he burned them on the altar.
He washed the innards and the feet and burned them on the burnt-offering, on the altar.
He brought the peoples offering; he took the peoples sin-offering-goat, and he slaughtered it and offered it as a sin-offering [<b>atoned with its blood</b>], in the same manner as the first one.
He brought the burnt-offering and he did it according to the rule.
He brought the meal-offering; he filled his palm from it and burned it on the altar: aside from the burnt-offering [that was brought] in the morning.
He slaughtered the ox and the ram, the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offerings of the people; and Aharons sons presented the blood to him and he sprinkled it all around the altar.
The fats of the ox and of the ram; the fat-tail, the [fat] covering [the innards], the kidneys and the lobe of the liver.
They put the fats on top of the breasts and he burned the fats on the altar.
The breasts and the right thigh, Aharon waved [<b>lifted up</b>] [as] a wave-offering [<b>an uplifted-offering</b>] before Adonoy, just as Moshe commanded.
Aharon raised his hands toward the people and he blessed them. He descended [from the altar where he] had offered the sin-offering, the burnt-offering and the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offering.
And Moshe and Aharon went [in]to the Tent of Meeting and [then] they went outside and blessed the people, and the glory of Adonoy appeared [<b>became revealed</b>] to the entire people.
A fire came forth from before Adonoy and consumed what was on the altar; the burnt-offering and the fats. All the people saw and they raised their voices in praise, and they fell on their faces.

Chapter 10

Nodov and Avihu, Aharons sons, took, each of them his fire-pan, placed fire on it and then placed incense upon it and they brought before Adonoy a strange fire, which He had not commanded them.
A fire came forth from before Adonoy and consumed them, and they died in the presence of Adonoy.
Moshe said to Aharon It is as Adonoy spoke, saying: through those that are near me I shall be sanctified, and in the presence of the entire people I will be glorified, and Aharon was silent.
Moshe called to Mishael and to Elzafan the sons of Uziel, [<b>the brother of the father of</b>] Aharon’s uncle, and said to them; Come closer and carry your brothers from the presence of the Sanctuary, to beyond the encampment.
They came closer and they carried them in their tunics to beyond the encampment, just as Moshe spoke.
Moshe said to Aharon and to Elozor and Isomor, his sons: Do not let your hair grow long and do not tear your garments so that you will not die and bring [Divine] anger on the entire congregation; your brothers, the entire House of Yisroel shall weep over the conflagration that Adonoy set ablaze.
From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not go forth lest you die; for the anointing oil of [<b>the inauguration to greatness of</b>] Adonoy is on you and they did as Moshe had said.
Adonoy spoke to Aharon, saying,
Do not drink wine or any other intoxicant, you and your sons with you, when you enter the Tent of Meeting and you will not die; this is an everlasting statute throughout your generations.
[So that you may] distinguish between what is sacred and what is mundane, between what is impure and what is pure.
[And that you may] teach Bnei Yisroel all the statutes that Adonoy spoke to them, through Moshe.
Moshe spoke to Aharon and to Elozor and Isomor, his surviving sons; Take the meal-offering which remains of the fire-offering [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy and eat it [as] <i>matzos</i> [<b>matzoh</b>] [unleavened] beside the altar, for it is holy of holies [=most holy].
You shall eat it in a sacred place, for it is your portion and the portion of your sons of the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy, for so have I been commanded.
The breast of the wave-offering [<b>uplifted-offering</b>] and the thigh that is the separated portion you shall eat in a pure (undefiled) place, you and your sons and daughters with you, for as your portion and as the portion of your sons they are given from the sacrifices of the peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offerings of Bnei Yisroel.
The thigh that is the separated portion and the breast that is the wave-offering [<b>uplifted-offering</b>], on top of the fats of the fire offering [<b>offering</b>], they shall bring, to wave [<b>lift up</b>] as a wave-offering [<b>an uplifted-offering</b>] before Adonoy. It will be for you and for your sons with you an everlasting statute, just as Adonoy commanded.
Regarding the goat of the sin-offering; Moshe made a detailed inquiry and behold! It was burned. He was angry with Elozor and Isomor, the remaining sons of Aharon, saying:
Why did you not eat the sin-offering in a sacred place, for it is holy of holies [=most holy], and He gave it to you, to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to atone for them before Adonoy.
Behold its blood was not brought inside the Sanctuary, you should certainly have eaten it in a holy place as I have commanded.
Aharon spoke [in reply] to Moshe, Behold, today they brought their sin-offerings and their burnt-offerings before Adonoy and then such [tragedy] befell me. If I had eaten the sin-offering today, would that have been good in the eyes of [<b>fitting before</b>] Adonoy?
Moshe heard, and it was good [<b>pleasing</b>] in his eyes.

Chapter 11

And Adonoy spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying to them:
Speak to Bnei Yisroel, saying: these are the living things that you may eat from among all the animals that are on the earth.
All that have a cloven hoof, and they [the hooves] are [completely] split and that [also] chews its cud [<b>brings up dissolved food</b>] among animals, you may eat it.
However, these in particular you may not eat of those that chew [<b>bring up</b>] their cud [<b>dissolved food</b>] and that have cloven hooves: the camel, for he chews [<b>brings up</b>] his cud [<b>dissolved food</b>] but does not have a split hoof it is unclean to you.
The [<b>jumping</b>] rabbit , for it chews [<b>brings up</b>] its cud [<b>dissolved food</b>] but does not have a cloven hoof it is unclean to you.
The hare, for it chews [<b>brings up</b>] its cud [<b>dissolved food</b>] but it does not have a cloven hoof it is unclean to you.
The pig, for though it has cloven hooves, and its hooves are [completely] split—it does not chew [<b>bring up</b>] its cud [<b>dissolved food</b>]—it is unclean to you.
You shall not eat of their flesh and you may not touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.
These you may eat, of all things that are in water; all that have fins and scales in the waters, in oceans and in rivers; you may eat them.
All that do not have fins and scales [that are] in the oceans and rivers; of any creature that creeps in the water and of any living creature that is in the water; they are repulsive to you.
They shall be repulsive to you, you shall not eat of their flesh and their carcasses shall be repulsive by you.
Anything which does not have fins and scales in the water, is repulsive to you.
These you shall consider repulsive from among the fowl; they may not be eaten; they are repulsive: the eagle, the white-tailed eagle and the bearded vulture.
The falcon and the [<b>tearing</b>] vulture, to its kind.
Every raven, to its kind.
The ostrich, the owl, the seagull and the sparrow hawk, to its kind.
The little owl, the cormorant [<b>fish drawer</b>] and the eagle owl.
The horned owl, the pelican and the carrion vulture.
The [<b>white</b>] stork and the heron, to its kind. The hoopoe [<b>mountain splitter</b>] and the bat.
All winged insects that walk on four [legs] are repulsive to you.
However, these you may eat of all the flying insects that walk on four [legs], those which have knees extending above their legs so that it hops on the ground with them.
Of them, these you may eat; the locust, to its kind the <i>solom</i>-locust, to its kind, the grasshopper, to its kind and the <i>chogov</i>-hopper, to its kind.
All flying insects that have four feet are repulsive to you.
As for these, [animals], you can be made unclean; all those who touch their carcasses shall be unclean until the evening.
Anyone who carries of their carcasses; shall wash his garments and is unclean until the evening.
Thus every animal that has cloven hooves but its hooves are not [completely] split and it does not bring up its cud [<b>dissolved food</b>], they are unclean to you; all who touch them shall become unclean.
All [animals] that walk on their paws among all the living creatures that walk on four legs, they are unclean to you. All who touch their carcasses shall be unclean until the evening.
Whoever carries their carcasses shall wash his garments and is unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.
These [also] are unclean to you among all creeping creatures that crawl on the ground; the weasel, the mouse and the toad, to its kind.
The hedgehog, the chameleon, the lizard, the slug and the mole.
These are unclean to you among all the creeping creatures. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.
Everything, wherever a part of them may fall when they are dead, shall become unclean, such as a wooden vessel, or a garment, or a hide or a sack. Every vessel with which work is done, shall be brought [put] into water, and remains unclean until the evening, [then] it becomes clean.
Every earthen vessel into which a part of them may fall, everything that is within it becomes unclean, and you shall break it.
Of all foods that are eaten upon which water comes, shall be unclean. Every beverage that is drunk, in any vessel, shall be impure.
Everything upon which any part of their carcasses fall, shall be unclean [even] an oven and a hearth shall be shattered, they are unclean and they shall be unclean to you.
However, a well-spring and a pit, a gathering of [<b>place of gathered</b>] water, shall be pure. [But] that which touches their carcasses shall be unclean.
If any part of their carcasses falls on any sowing seed that will be planted, it remains [ritually] clean.
If water was once placed on seeds and part of their carcasses fall upon them, they are unclean to you.
If any animal dies [of those] that are permitted to eat whoever touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
Whoever eats of its carcass shall wash his garments and is unclean until the evening. Whoever carries its carcass shall wash his garments and is unclean until the evening.
Every creeping creature which crawls on the ground is repulsive, it may not be eaten.
Whatever crawls on its belly and whatever goes on four [legs] or whatever has many feet; regarding all creeping creatures that crawl on the ground; you may not eat them, for they are repulsive.
Do not make yourselves repulsive by [eating] any creeping creature that crawls, and do not make yourselves unclean with them, for you will become unclean because of them.
For I am Adonoy, your God; you shall sanctify yourselves and you shall become holy, for I am Holy and you shall not make yourselves unclean with any creeping creature that crawls on the ground.
For I am Adonoy, who brings you up from the land of Egypt to be your God. You shall be holy, for I am Holy.
This is the law concerning the animals and the fowl and of all living creatures that swarm in the waters and for all creatures that crawl on the earth.
To distinguish between the unclean and between the clean, and between the living creatures which may be eaten and between the living creature which may not be eaten.

Chapter 12

Adonoy spoke to Moshe saying:
Speak to Bnei Yisroel, saying, when a woman conceives and gives birth to a male child she will be ritually unclean for seven days; as the days of her menstrual flow [<b>the state of her impure ‘separation’</b>], she will be unclean.
On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
For thirty-three days she will remain [in the status] that the blood [she sees] is ritually pure. She shall not touch anything holy and she shall not come into the Sanctuary, until the days of her purity are completed.
If she gives birth to a female she will be unclean for two weeks [<b>fourteen days</b>] as during her menstruation [<b>‘separation’</b>]. For sixty-six days she will remain [in the status] that the blood [she sees] is ritually pure.
When the days of her purification are completed, be it for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb, in its first year, as a burnt-offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin-offering, to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, to the <i>kohein.</i>
He will bring it before Adonoy and atone for her and she will be cleansed from the source [<b>impurity</b>] of her blood; this is the law regarding the woman who gives birth to a male or to a female.
If she cannot afford [to acquire] a lamb she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons; one as a burnt-offering and one as a sin-offering. The <i>kohein</i> will atone for her and she will be cleansed.

Chapter 13

Adonoy spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:
When a person will have, in the skin of his flesh a spot of intense [<b>deep</b>] whiteness or an off-white spot, or a snow-white spot, and it forms on the skin of his body [like] the plague of <i>tzoraas,</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] he shall be brought to Aharon, the <i>kohein,</i> or to one of his sons, the <i>kohanim.</i>
The <i>kohein</i> shall see the plague in the skin of the flesh and [if] the hair in the skin-eruption has turned white and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the skin of his body, it is the skin-eruption of <i>tzoraas.</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] The <i>kohein</i> shall see it and declare him [to be] unclean.
If it is a snow-white spot in the skin of the flesh and it does not appear deeper than the skin and the hair did not turn white, the <i>kohein</i> shall confine the plague for seven days.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see him on the seventh day and behold! [if] the skin-eruption has maintained its hue [<b>remained as it was</b>]; the skin-eruption did not spread [<b>increase</b>] in the skin. The <i>kohein</i> shall confine him for seven days, a second time,
The <i>kohein</i> shall see him on the seventh day for the second time and behold! [if] the skin-eruption became dimmer and the skin-eruption did not spread [<b>increase</b>] in the skin, the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him [to be] clean; it is [merely] a [<b>removed</b>] white discoloration. He shall wash his garments and he will be cleansed.
If the [<b>removed</b>] white discoloration has spread [<b>increased</b>] in the skin after it was shown to the <i>kohein,</i> who pronounced that it was clean, it must be shown a second time to the <i>kohein.</i>
The <i>kohein</i> shall see and behold! [if] the [<b>removed</b>] white discoloration has spread [<b>increased</b>] in the skin, the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him unclean, it is <i>tzoraas.</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>]
When there is a skin-eruption of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] on a person he shall be brought to the <i>kohein.</i>
The <i>kohein</i> shall see and behold! there is an intensely [<b>deep</b>] white spot on the skin and it has turned the hair white or there is [<b>an impression of</b>] healthy flesh in the spot of intense [<b>deep</b>] whiteness,
it is an old <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] in the skin of his body and the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him unclean he shall not confine him, since he is [obviously] unclean.
And if the <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] sprouts on the skin and if the <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] covered the entire skin of the [one affected by] the eruption from his head until his feet to the extent that the <i>kohein</i> can see.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see and behold! the <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] has covered all of his body, he shall declare the skin-eruption to be cleansed, it has turned completely white, he is clean.
On the day that healthy flesh appears on him, he will become unclean.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see the healthy flesh and declare him unclean. The healthy flesh is unclean, it is <i>tzoraas.</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>]
Or, if the healthy flesh turns again and it was changed to white, he shall come [<b>be brought</b>] to the <i>kohein.</i>
The <i>kohein</i> shall see him, and behold! the skin-eruption has turned white; the <i>kohein</i> shall declare the skin-eruption to be clean, he is clean.
When a person has on his skin an inflammation that has healed.
If there was on the area of the inflammation a spot of intense [<b>deep</b>] whiteness or a snow-white spot tinged with red it shall be shown to the <i>kohein.</i>
The <i>kohein</i> shall see it and behold! its appearance is lower than the skin, and its hair has turned white, the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him unclean; It is the skin-eruption of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] that has sprouted through the inflammation.
If the <i>kohein</i> looks at it and behold! there is no white hair in it, and it is not lower than the skin and it is faint, the <i>kohein</i> shall confine him for seven days.
If it spread [<b>increased</b>] in the skin, the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him unclean, it is a skin eruption.
If the snow-white spot remains in its place and it did not spread [<b>increase</b>], it is [merely] a scar [<b>an impression</b>] of the inflammation and the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him clean.
When a person has on his skin a burn from a fire and [on] the healthy flesh [<b>impression</b>] of the burnt part, came a snow-white spot tinged with red or pure white spot.

The <i>kohein</i> shall declare him unclean, it is the skin-eruption of <i>tzoraas.</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>]
If the <i>kohein</i> shall see it, and behold! there is not, in the snow-white spot, any white hair and it is not lower than the skin, and it is faint. The <i>kohein</i> shall confine him for seven days.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see him on the seventh day. If it has spread [<b>increased</b>] in the skin, the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him unclean, it is the skin-eruption of <i>tzoraas.</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>]
If the snow-white spot remains in its place and it did not spread [<b>increase</b>] in the skin and it is faint, it is the [<b>deep</b>] white spot of the burn. The <i>kohein</i> shall declare him clean for it is [merely] the scar [<b>impression</b>] of the burn.
If a man or a woman will have a skin-eruption on the head or in the beard.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see the skin-eruption, and behold! its appearance is deeper than the skin and there is thin golden [<b>reddish</b>] hair in it. The <i>kohein</i> shall pronounce it unclean, It is a <i>nesek,</i> it is <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] of the head or the beard.
When the <i>kohein</i> will see the skin eruption of <i>nesek</i>—and behold! it does not appear deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the <i>kohein</i> shall confine [the one affected by] the skin-eruption of the <i>nesek</i> for seven days.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see the skin-eruption on the seventh day, and behold! the <i>nesek</i> did not spread [<b>increase</b>] and there was no golden [<b>reddish</b>] hair in it and the appearance of the <i>nesek</i> is not deeper than the skin.
He shall be shaved [<b>shave around the nesek</b>] but he shall not shave [<b>close to</b>] the <i>nesek,</i> and the <i>kohein</i> shall confine the <i>nesek</i> for a second seven day period.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see the <i>nesek</i> on the seventh day and behold! if the <i>nesek</i> did not spread [<b>increase</b>] in the skin and its appearance is not deeper than the skin. The <i>kohein</i> shall declare him clean. He shall wash his garments and he will be clean.
If the <i>nesek</i> spreads [<b>increases</b>] [extensively] in the skin after he is pronounced clean,
the <i>kohein</i> shall see him and behold! the <i>nesek</i> has spread [<b>increased</b>] in the skin. The <i>kohein</i> shall not [even] look for golden [<b>reddish</b>] hair, he is unclean.
If the <i>nesek</i> remained the same as it was and black hair grew in it, the <i>nesek</i> is healed, he is clean, and the <i>kohein</i> shall declare him clean.
When a man or a woman have in the skin of their flesh—white spots.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see, and behold! in the skin of their flesh are dim white spots, it is [merely] scurf that has sprouted in the skin; it is clean.
If a mans hair falls out, he is [merely] bald; he is clean.
If, on the front of his head his hair falls out, he is [merely] frontally bald; he is clean.
If there will be, in the baldness in back of the head or in the baldness in front of the head a white skin-eruption, tinged with red, it is <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] sprouting in his frontal baldness or in his posterior baldness.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see him, and behold! the spot of intense [<b>deep</b>] whiteness is tinged with red in his frontal baldness or in his posterior baldness just as the appearance <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] of the skin of the flesh.
He is a person with <i>tzoraas,</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] he is unclean. The <i>kohein</i> shall declare him unclean; his skin-eruption is on his head.
The <i>tzorua</i> [<b>one who is ‘confined’</b>]—[the person] who has the skin-eruption—his garments shall have a tear in them, his hair shall be grown long, and he must cover his head down to his upper lip [<b>like a mourner</b>], and [<b>do not become</b>] Unclean, [<b>do not become</b>] unclean, shall he call out.
All the days in which the skin-eruption is on him he shall be unclean; he is unclean. He shall dwell alone; his dwelling shall be beyond the encampment.
When in a garment there is a skin-eruption of <i>tzoraas,</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] whether a woolen garment or in a linen garment.
Or if it is the warp [lengthwise] threads, or in the woof [widthwise] threads, in a linen garment, or a woolen garment, or on leather or in any object made of leather.
If the plague is deep green or deep red [<b>green or red</b>], in the garment, or in the leather hide or in the warp threads, or in the woof threads, or if it is in any object made of leather; it is the eruption of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] and it shall be shown to the <i>kohein.</i>
The <i>kohein</i> shall see the plague and confine the eruption, for seven days.
He shall see the eruption on the seventh day. If the eruption has spread [<b>increased</b>] in the garment or in the warp thread, or in the woof thread, or in the leather hide, or in the work made of leather, it is a prickly <i>tzoraas,</i> [<b>‘confinement’ of loss</b>] it is unclean.
He shall burn the garment, or the warp [lengthwise] threads, or the woof [widthwise] threads, be it in wool or in linen, or in all leather made objects, in which there is the eruption. For it is a prickly <i>tzoraas.</i> [<b>‘confinement’ of loss</b>] It shall be burned in fire.
If the <i>kohein</i> will see, and behold! the eruption did not spread [<b>increase</b>] in the garment, or in the warp threads, or in the woof threads, or in any leather made object.
The <i>kohein</i> shall command that they shall wash the article having the eruption, and confine it for seven days, a second time.
The <i>kohein</i> shall see it after the eruption was washed and behold! [even if] the eruption did not change its hue [<b>from what it was</b>] and the eruption did not spread [<b>increase</b>]; it is unclean, you shall burn it in fire. It is a deep mark [<b>break</b>] be it in a worn [garment] or in a new [garment].
If the <i>kohein</i> saw and behold! the eruption grew faint after it was washed; he shall tear it from the garment, or from the leather, or from the warp threads or from the woof threads.
If it will appear again, in the garment or in the warp [lengthwise] threads, or in the woof [widthwise] threads, or in any leather-made object, it is a recurrent outbreak of <i>tzoraas.</i> You shall burn the article having the eruption in fire.
The garment, or the warp threads, or the woof threads, or any leather objects that were washed and the eruption disappears from them, it shall be washed a second time and it shall be purified.
This is the law of the eruption of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>‘confinement’</b>] be it in a woolen garment, or a linen garment, or in the warp [lengthwise] thread, or in the woof [widthwise] thread, or in any leather-made object, that it be pronounced pure, or that it be pronounced impure.

Chapter 14

And Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:
This shall be the law regarding the person with <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’</b>] on the day of his purification, he shall be brought to the <i>kohein</i>.
The <i>kohein</i> shall go out beyond the encampment. The <i>kohein</i> shall see; and behold! the skin-eruption of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’</b>] has healed from the person with <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’</b>].

The <i>kohein</i> shall take from the blood of the guilt-offering and the <i>kohein</i> shall put it on the middle ridge [<b>upper part</b>] of the right ear of the person being purified, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.

This is the law of whoever has the skin-eruption of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’</b>] whose means are not sufficient in his purification.
Adonoy spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:
When you will come into the land of Canaan that I will give to you for a possession, and I shall put the eruption of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’</b>] in the house of the land of your possession.
Whoevers house it is, shall come and tell to the <i>kohein</i>, saying, Something like an eruption has appeared to me in the house.
The <i>kohein</i> shall command, and they shall empty the house [of its contents] before the <i>kohein</i> will come to see the eruption so everything in the house shall not become impure. Afterwards, the <i>kohein</i> shall come to see the house.
He shall see the eruption and behold! The eruption is in the walls of the house; impressions, of greenest green or of reddest red [<b>green or red</b>] and they appear to be lower than the [surface of] the wall.
The <i>kohein</i> shall go out of the house to the entrance of the house, and place the house under quarantine for seven days.
The <i>kohein</i> shall return on the seventh day and shall see; and behold! the eruption has spread [<b>increased</b>] in the walls of the house.

He shall scrape the house from the inside, all around, and they shall throw away the earth that they scraped, beyond the city, to an impure place.
They shall take other stones, and they shall bring them to replace the stones, and he shall take other earth and plaster the house.
If the eruption returns and sprouts in the house after the stones were removed, and after the house was scraped, and after it was plastered,
the <i>kohein</i> shall come and see; and behold! the eruption has spread [<b>increased</b>] in the house; prickly <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’ of loss</b>] is in the house, it is impure.
He shall dismantle the house; its stones and its wood and all the earth of the house. He shall take it out beyond the city, to an impure place.
Whoever will come inside the house [during] all the days of its confinement, shall be impure until the evening.
Whoever will lie down inside the house shall wash his garments. Whoever will eat inside the house shall wash his garments.
If the <i>kohein</i> shall come and see; and behold! the eruption did not spread [<b>increase</b>] in the house after the house was plastered, the <i>kohein</i> shall pronounce the house [to be] pure, for the eruption has been healed.
He shall take, to purify the house, two birds, cedar wood, crimson [<b>colored</b>] thread and hyssop.
He shall slaughter one bird in an earthenware vessel, over running water.

He shall send the living bird, beyond the city into the open field, and atone for the house and it shall be purified.
This is the law for all the eruptions of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’</b>] and for the <i>nesek</i>.
For <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’</b>] of the garment and of the house.
For the spot [<b>deeply</b>] white as wool, for the spot that is nearly as white and for the spot white as snow.
To teach [the law] of the day of becoming impure and of the day of becoming pure; this is the law of <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>’confinement’</b>].

Chapter 16

And Adonoy spoke to Moshe after the death of two sons of Aharon, who brought an [unauthorized] offering [<b>strange fire</b>] before Adonoy and they died.
Adonoy spoke to Moshe: Speak to your brother Aharon that he not come at all times into the Holy [Sanctuary] that is inside of the Curtain, before the Ark-cover that is on the Ark so that he not die, for in a cloud I shall appear [<b>become revealed</b>] on the [<b>House of the</b>] Ark-cover.
With this shall Aharon come into the Holy [Sanctuary]; with a young bullock, for a sin-offering and a ram, for a burnt-offering.
He shall don a sanctified, linen tunic and linen pants shall be on his body. He shall gird himself with a linen sash and place a linen turban on his head. These are sacred garments; he shall bathe his body in water and clothe himself in them.
He shall take, from the congregation of Israel two he-goats for sin-offerings and one ram for a burnt-offering.
Aharon shall bring the sin-offering bullock which is his and atone on his own behalf and on behalf of his household.
He shall take the two he-goats and stand them before Adonoy, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
Aharon shall put lots on the two he-goats; one lot [marked] for [<b>the Name of</b>] Adonoy and one lot [marked] for Azazel.
Aharon shall bring the goat upon which the lot [marked] for [<b>the Name of</b>] Adonoy came up and do (offer) it as a sin-offering.
The goat upon which came up the lot [marked] for Azazel shall be placed, alive, before Adonoy, to achieve atonement with it to send it to Azazel, in the desert.
Aharon shall bring the sin-offering-bullock which is his and atone on his behalf and on behalf of his household, and he shall slaughter his sin-offering-bullock.
He shall take a full hand-shovel of fiery coals from atop the altar, which is before Adonoy and full handfuls of finely-ground incense and he shall bring [them] inside of the curtain.
He shall put the incense [<b>spices</b>] on the fire before Adonoy and the cloud of incense will cover the Ark-cover that is on the [tablets of] Testimony, that he not die.
He shall take some of the bullocks blood and he shall sprinkle with his finger, above the surface of the Ark-cover on its eastern part; and before the Ark-cover, he shall sprinkle, some blood, with his finger, seven times.
He shall slaughter the he-goat sin-offering that belongs to the people, and he shall bring its blood inside of the Curtain. He shall do [with] its blood just as he did with the bullocks blood and he shall sprinkle it on the Ark-cover and before of the Ark-cover.
He will atone for the Sanctuary, from the impurities of Bnei Yisroel and from their rebellious sins for all their transgressions. He shall do likewise for the Tent of Meeting, that dwells with them in the midst of their impurity.
No man shall be present in the Tent of Meeting when he comes in to atone for the Holy [Sanctuary] until he leaves. He shall atone on his behalf and on behalf of his household and on behalf of the entire assembly of Israel.
He shall go out to the altar that is before Adonoy and atone on it. He shall take some of the bullocks blood and some of the he-goats blood and put it atop the corners of the altar, all around.
He shall sprinkle on it from the blood that is on his finger seven times and purify it and sanctify it from the impurities of Bnei Yisroel.
When he finishes atoning for the Holy [Sanctuary] and [for] the Tent of Meeting and [for] the altar he shall bring the live he-goat.
Aharon shall lay his two hands on the head of the live he-goat and confess on it all the iniquities of Bnei Yisroel and all their rebellious transgressions for all their sins, and put them on the head of the goat and send it away with the man [so] designated, to [<b>go to</b>] the desert.
The goat shall carry upon itself all of their iniquities to a desolate [<b>an uninhabited</b>] land, and [the man shall] send the goat into the desert.
Aharon will [then] come into the Tent of Meeting and remove the linen garments that he wore when he came into the Holy [Sanctuary] and place [<b>hide</b>] them there.
He shall wash his flesh in water in a sacred place and don his garments. He shall go out and do (offer) his burnt-offering and the peoples burnt-offering and atone on his behalf and on behalf of the people.

He who burns them shall wash his garments and bathe his body in water and afterwards he shall come into the encampment.
It shall be for an everlasting statute for you; in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, you shall afflict yourselves and not do any work, the native-born [<b>settled one</b>] and the proselyte residing [<b>that converts</b>] among you.
For on this day He will make atonement for you, to purify you from all your sins, before Adonoy, you will be purified.
It is a <i>Shabbos</i> of Shabbosos to you and you must afflict yourselves; it is an everlasting statute.
The <i>kohein</i> will atone—he who himself will be anointed [<b>inaugurated to greatness</b>] and who will be initiated—[<b>offer his sacrifice</b>] to serve in his fathers stead and dress in the linen garments, the sacred garments.
He will atone for the Holy [Sanctuary]; and for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar, he will atone; for the <i>kohanim</i> and for the entire people of the congregation, he will atone.
This shall be for you as an everlasting statute, to achieve atonement for Bnei Yisroel from all their sins, once a year. He did as Adonoy commanded Moshe.

Chapter 17

Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying:
Speak to Aharon and to his sons and to all Bnei Yisroel and say to them; this is the edict that Adonoy commanded, saying:
Each and every person of the House of Israel who will slaughter an ox, lamb, or goat within the encampment or who will slaughter [it] beyond the encampment.
And to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it so that it may be brought as an offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, before the Mishkan of Adonoy; it shall be considered for that person as blood, he has spilled blood, and that person shall be cut off from among his people.
So that Bnei Yisroel shall bring their sacrifices that they [would] slaughter on the field, and [instead] they shall bring them to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, to the <i>kohein</i>, and slaughter them as peace[<b>sacred</b>]-offerings to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
The <i>kohein</i> shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Adonoy at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat as a pleasing fragrance to [<b>to be accepted with favor before</b>] Adonoy.
They shall no longer slaughter their sacrifices to the demons after which they go astray. This shall be an everlasting statute for them, for their descendants.
To them you shall say: each and every person of the House of Israel and from the proselyte who will reside [<b>convert</b>] among them, who will bring a burnt-offering or sacrifice [<b>sacred-offering</b>],
and to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he does not bring it, that it be offered to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy; that person shall be cut off from his people.
Each and every person of the House of Israel and from the proselyte who resides [<b>converts</b>] among them who will eat any blood; I shall direct my anger on the soul of him [<b>person</b>] who eats the blood and I will cut it off from among its people.
For [the] soul of the body is in the blood and I have given it to you [to be placed] on the altar to achieve atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that will achieve atonement for the soul.
Therefore, I have said to Bnei Yisroel: Every soul [<b>person</b>] among you shall not eat blood. The proselyte residing [<b>that converts</b>] among you shall not eat blood.
Each and every person of the House of Israel and from the proselyte residing [<b>that converts</b>] among them who will ensnare [the catch] any wild animal or fowl that is permitted to be eaten, he shall spill its blood and cover it with earth.
For [as to] the life of all flesh, its blood is its life, and I have said to Bnei Yisroel: The blood of any flesh, you should not eat, for, the life of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats of it, shall be cut off.
Anybody that will eat an improperly slaughtered animal or an animal with a fatal defect among the native-born [<b>settled one</b>] and the proselyte, shall wash his clothing and bathe in water and is impure until the evening, and [then] becomes purified.
If he does not wash [his clothes] and does not bathe his flesh, he bears [the burden of] his iniquity.

Chapter 18

Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying.
Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them I am Adonoy, your God.
After the practice of the [<b>people of the</b>] Land of Egypt in which you have lived, you shall not do, and the practice of the [<b>people of the</b>] Land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you, you shall not do and you shall not follow their statutes [customs].

You shall keep My statutes and My laws which if a man obeys he shall live through them [<b>in the World to Come</b>]; I am Adonoy.
Each and every person—to any of his close kin—You shall not approach to uncover [their] nakedness, I am Adonoy.

The nakedness of your fathers wife you shall not uncover; it is your fathers nakedness.
The nakedness of your sister [whether she is] your fathers daughter or your mothers daughter; whether she is born in the house [<b>to your father from another woman</b>], or she is born outside [<b>to your mother from another man</b>], you shall not uncover their nakedness.

Together with any animal you shall not lie [conjugally] to defile yourself with it. A woman shall not stand before an animal to copulate with it [<b>control her</b>]; it is defilement.
Do not defile yourselves in any one of these [ways], for in all of these [ways] the nations have become defiled [those] that I am driving away [<b>exiling</b>] from before you.
The land became defiled and I judged its iniquities upon it and the land expelled its inhabitants.
You shall adhere to My statutes and to My laws and not do any of these abominations [both] the native born [<b>settled one</b>] and the proselyte who resides [<b>converts</b>] among you.
For all of these abominations were done by the people of the land who came before you and the land became defiled.
[So that] the land not expel you when you defile it as it expelled the nation [<b>nations</b>] before you.
For anyone who will do any of these abominations, their souls shall be cut off, those who do these things, from among their people.
You shall keep my watch [<b>the watch of My Word</b>] that you shall not do any of the abominable customs that were done before you and you will not defile yourselves through them. I am Adonoy, your God.

I shall direct My wrath on that man and I shall cut him off from among his people, for he gave of his children to <i>Molech</i>, in order to defile My Sanctuary and profane My Holy Name.
If the people of the land [<b>House of Israel</b>] will hide their eyes from that person, when he gives of his children to <i>Molech</i>, and they do not put him to death.

You shall not follow the customs of the nation which I am expelling before you. For they have done all these above mentioned sins and I became disgusted with [<b>my Word distanced</b>] them.

Except to his kin to whom he is closely related, for his mother and his father, for his son, his daughter and for his brother.
For his virgin sister, to whom he is closely related, who has not yet been married, for her, he may be defiled.
A husband [<b>An honored one among his people</b>] may not defile himself among his people [for a wife through whom] he becomes profaned.
They shall not make baldness on their heads and the corners of their beards they shall not shave, and they shall not make gashes in their flesh.
They shall be holy to [<b>before</b>] their God and they shall not profane the Name of their God, for [it is] the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy, the bread [<b>sacrifice</b>] of their God [that] they bring [offer], and they must [therefore] be holy.
A harlot [<b>One who strays</b>] or a profaned woman they shall not marry. A woman divorced from her husband they shall not marry, for he is holy to [<b>before</b>] his God.
You shall make him holy for he offers the bread [<b>sacrifice</b>] of your God; he shall be holy unto you for I, Adonoy, am holy, Who makes you holy.
The daughter of a <i>kohein</i>, who profanes herself by fornication [<b>straying</b>]—she profanes her father—[<b>she becomes profane with respect to her father’s holiness</b>] she shall be burned with fire.
The <i>kohein</i> who is greatest among his brethren upon whose head was poured the anointing oil [<b>which inaugurates to greatness</b>]; whose hands [<b>sacrifices</b>] were consecrated [<b>offered</b>] to put on the special garments; shall not let his hair grow wild and he shall not tear his garments.
And adjacent to any dead body he shall not enter. For his father and mother he shall not become [ritually] impure.
He shall not depart from the Sanctuary and he shall not profane his Gods Sanctuary, for the crown of his Gods anointing oil [<b>which inaugurates to greatness</b>] is upon him, I am Adonoy.

Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;
Speak to Aharon saying; Anyone of your offspring, through [all] their generations who will have a blemish, shall not approach to offer the bread [<b>sacrifice</b>] of [<b>before</b>] his God.
For any man who has a blemish shall not approach; a blind man or a lame man, or a man with a sunken nose, or a man who has disproportionate limbs.
or a man who has a broken (crippled) foot, or a broken (crippled) hand,
or one with overhanging eyebrows, or with a cataract, or a disarrangement [in the eye], or one with scurf or scabs, or one with crushed testicles.
Any man who has a blemish, who is a descendant of Aharon the <i>kohein</i>, shall not approach to offer the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy. He has a blemish; the bread [<b>sacrifice</b>] of his God he may not approach to offer [as an offering].
The bread of his God which is of the most holy, and from the holy [offerings] he may eat.
However, he may not enter beyond the Curtain and he shall not approach the Altar for he has a blemish and he shall not profane My holy things, for I am Adonoy, who sanctifies them.
Moshe spoke [these words] to Aharon, and to his sons and to all of Bnei Yisroel.

Chapter 22

Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;
Speak to Aharon and to his sons and let them keep away from the holy offerings of Bnei Yisroel and they shall not profane My holy name which they sanctify for [<b>before</b>] Me, I am Adonoy.
Say to them; throughout your generations; any person of your offspring who will draw near to the holy things which Bnei Yisroel will sanctify to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy [while] his impurity is on him that soul [<b>person</b>] shall be cut off from My Presence, I am Adonoy.
Any man of Aharons offspring; who has <i>tzoraas</i> [<b>the plague of ’confinement’</b>] or an impure flow, may not eat of the sacred things until he has purified himself. [The same is true] of anyone who touches anything defiled by the dead [<b>soul</b>], or anyone who has had a seminal emission,
or anyone who touches any creeping creature that causes impurity to him, or any person which causes impurity to him, [with] whatever impurity he has.
Anyone touching [that person] will be impure until the evening. He shall not eat of the holy things unless he has washed his body in water.
When the sun sets, he is pure, and afterwards, he may eat of the holy things, for it is his bread.
An animal which has died on its own, or an animal that was fatally maimed, he must not eat to defile himself with it, I am Adonoy.
They shall keep my charge [<b>the charge of My Word</b>] lest they bear [the burden] of sin and die because of it for having profaned [it]. I am Adonoy Who makes them holy.

When a koheins daughter marries a non-<i>kohein</i>, the sacred <i>terumah</i> [<b>separated</b>] portions may not be eaten by her.
If a koheins daughter is either widowed or divorced, and she has no children, and she returns to her fathers home as in her youth, she may eat of her fathers bread. No non-<i>kohein</i> may eat of it.
If a man inadvertently eats of sacred-offering, he shall add a fifth, to it[s worth] and give to the <i>kohein</i> the holy thing.
They shall not profane the holy things of Bnei Yisroel that which they designated for [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
They burden them[selves] with the sin of their guilt when they eat their holy things [<b>in impurity</b>], for I am Adonoy, Who makes them holy.
Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;
Speak to Aharon and to his sons and to all of Bnei Yisroel and say to them; any man of the House of Israel, and from the proselytes of Israel who will bring his offering for any of their vows or for any of their free-will-offerings that they will bring to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, for a burnt-offering.
To gain acceptance [it must be] an unblemished male of cattle, sheep or goats.
Anything that has a blemish on it you shall not bring, for it will not be accepted favorably for you.

A blind, broken-limbed, cracked or wart[ed animal]; or [an animal] with scurf or scabs you shall not bring these to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy; and as a fire-offering [<b>an offering</b>] you shall not place of them on the altar of [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.

[An animal that has its testicles] crushed, mangled, torn or cut off you shall not bring to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy and in your land you shall not inflict these injuries.
And from a strangers [gentiles] hand you shall not bring (offer) the bread [<b>offering</b>] of your God from any of these for they have inflicted wounds in them; they will not be favorably accepted for you.
Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;
An ox, lamb or goat, when it is born, shall be with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day and thereafter it may be favorably accepted as a sacrifice as a fire-offering to [<b>an offering before</b>] Adonoy.
An ox [<b>cow</b>] or a [<b>female</b>] lamb, it and its [<b>her and her</b>] offspring, you shall not slaughter in one day.
When you sacrifice a thanks-giving-offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, that it be favorably accepted for you you shall sacrifice it.
On that day [that it is sacrificed] you should eat it; you shall leave none of it until the next morning, I am Adonoy.
You shall preserve My commandments and fulfill them, I am Adonoy.
You shall not profane My holy Name; but I will be sanctified among Bnei Yisroel. I am Adonoy Who makes you holy.

He shall wave [<b>lift up</b>] the <i>omer</i> before Adonoy that it be favorably accepted for you. On the day after the day of rest (Pesach), the <i>kohein</i> shall wave [<b>lift</b>] it [<b>up</b>].

When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not cut completely the corner of your field when you reap. You shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and the proselyte, I am Adonoy, your God.

Command Bnei Yisroel to take (bring) to you pure, pressed, olive oil for illumination to keep the lamp [<b>lamps</b>] burning constantly.

On each and every <i>Shabbos</i> he shall arrange them before Adonoy, continually, from [<b>before</b>] Bnei Yisroel as an eternal covenant.
It shall belong to Aharon and to his sons and they shall eat it in a sacred place, for it is most holy for him from among the fire-offerings [<b>offerings</b>] of Adonoy, as an everlasting statute.
The son of an Israelite woman went out, and he was the son of an Egyptian man, among Bnei Yisroel. They argued in the encampment—the son of the Israelite woman, and the Israelite man.
The Israelite womans son clearly pronounced the Name [of God] and blasphemed [<b>caused anger</b>] and they brought him to Moshe. The name of his mother was Shlomis, daughter of Divri of the tribe of Dan.
They placed [<b>bound</b>] him in the guardhouse until [his penalty] would be explained to them through the [<b>law of the</b>] word of Adonoy.
Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;
Take the blasphemer [<b>one who has caused anger</b>] beyond the encampment, and all those who heard him shall lay their hands on his head and the entire congregation shall stone him.
And to Bnei Yisroel you shall speak, saying; Any person who shall blaspheme [<b>cause anger before</b>] his God shall bear [the burden of] his sin.
Whoever pronounces clearly the Name of Adonoy [and blasphemes] he will surely be put to death. The entire congregation shall surely stone him. The proselyte and native born [<b>settled one</b>] alike when he clearly articulates the Name, shall be put to death.
Any man who kills any human being must surely be put to death.
Whoever kills an animal shall pay for it, [the compensation of] an animal for an animal.
A man who maims his neighbor just as he did, so shall be done to him.

Whoever smites [<b>kills</b>] an animal shall pay for it. Whoever smites [<b>kills</b>] a person shall be put to death.
One rule shall apply for all of you just as it is for the proselyte, so it shall be for the native born [<b>settled one</b>], for I am Adonoy, your God.
Moshe spoke to Bnei Yisroel and they took the blasphemer [<b>one who caused anger</b>], beyond the encampment and they stoned him with a stone. And Bnei Yisroel did just as Adonoy commanded Moshe.

Chapter 25

Adonoy spoke to Moshe on Mount Sinai, saying;
Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them, when you come to the land which I give to you the land shall be at rest—a <i>Shabbos</i> for [<b>rest before</b>] Adonoy.
For six years you shall plant your field and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and you shall harvest its produce.
But the seventh year shall be a <i>Shabbos</i> of [<b>complete</b>] rest for the land, a <i>Shabbos</i> for [<b>rest before</b>] Adonoy, you shall not plant your field and you shall not prune your vineyard.
[Even] crops that grew on their own [from the seeds of your previous] harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your untended vines you shall not gather; it shall be a year of complete rest for the land.
The [produce] [<b>rest</b>] of the lands <i>Shabbos</i>[-year] [<b>land</b>] shall be for yourselves, for food, for you, your servant and your maidservant, for your hired hand and your resident sojourner who reside with you.
[Also] for your domesticated animals and for the [wild] beasts that are in your land shall all of its produce be for food.
You shall count for yourself seven sabbatical years [<b>of rest</b>], seven years, seven times and it shall be for you, the days (period) of the seven sabbatical years [<b>of rest</b>], forty-nine years.
You shall make a proclamation [<b>crying</b>] with the <i>shofor</i> on the tenth day of the seventh month. On Yom Kippur shall this <i>shofor</i>-proclamation be made. throughout all your land.
You shall sanctify the year of the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom in the land for all of its inhabitants; it shall be for you a jubilee and each man shall return to his ancestral land and each man shall return to his family.
It is a jubilee, [that] the year of the fiftieth year shall be for you. You shall not plant and you shall not reap [even] crops that grew on their own; and you shall not gather the [grapes of] its untended vineyard,
For it is a jubilee, it shall be holy to you. Whatever is in the field, you may eat of its produce.
On this jubilee year, each man shall return to his ancestral land.
If you sell anything to your neighbor, or purchase [something] from your neighbor, do not cheat one another.
According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall purchase [land] from your neighbor; according to the number of produce years he shall sell it to you.
Based on the abundance of years, you shall increase its purchase price and based on the lack of years you shall decrease its purchase price, since it is the number of produce-seasons that he is selling to you.
You shall not cheat one another, and you shall fear your God for I am Adonoy, your God.
You shall fulfill My statutes and keep My laws and fulfill them, and you will then live in the land in security.
The land will give forth its fruit and you will eat your fill, and you will live securely on it.
If you shall say (ask) What will we eat in the seventh year, for lo! we have not planted nor gathered our produce?
I shall command (direct) My blessing to you in the sixth year and it will produce [enough] for three years.
You shall plant in the eighth year but you will still be eating from the old produce until the ninth year; until the [new] produce arrives (ripens) you shall eat [from] the old.
The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is Mine, for, you are [merely as] foreigners [<b>foreign resident</b>] and resident aliens [<b>residents</b>] before Me.
In all of your ancestral lands you shall grant redemption to the land.
If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his ancestral land, and a close relative comes and redeems that which his brother sold.
[Or] if the man has no redeemer (close relative) but has acquired sufficient means and finds [it] enough to redeem it [himself],
He shall calculate the number of years for which he sold the land and return the remainder (excess) to the man to whom he had sold it, and he shall return to his ancestral land.
Or if he does not have within his means enough to retrieve the land to himself, then that which he sold remains in the possession of the buyer until the jubilee year. It is then released by the jubilee and he [the seller] returns to his ancestral land.
If a man shall sell a residential home [that is] within [<b>surrounded by</b>] a walled city, the time allotted for its redemption shall be until the end of one year after he sold it. He has the days [of a full year] in which to redeem it.
If he does not redeem it by the end of a full year, the house within the city that is surrounded by a wall shall then remain in perpetuity to its purchaser for his generations (descendants.) It is not released by the jubilee.
The houses of open cities which are not surrounded by a [<b>an encircling</b>] wall shall be considered as a field of the land. It shall have a redemption and it is released by the jubilee.

The field on the outskirts of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual ancestral land.
If your brother becomes impoverished and his hand (assets) become shaky among you, you must support him, [so too] the proselyte [<b>foreign resident</b>] and the sojourner, [so] that he shall live with you.
You shall not take from him interest or usury and you shall fear your God, and your brother shall live with you.
You must not give (lend) him your money with interest, and usuriously you must not advance him your food.
I am Adonoy your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, to be a God for you.
If your brother becomes impoverished and is sold to you, you must not work him like a slave [<b>slaves</b>].
Like a hired hand or resident [worker] shall he be with you He shall serve you until the jubilee year.
Then he and his children shall depart from you and return to his own family. He shall return to his ancestral estate.
For they are My servants, whom I brought out from the land of Egypt, they shall not be sold [in the market] as slaves.
You must not rule over him [<b>make him work</b>] to crush him and you shall fear your God.
Your slaves and maidservants that you shall possess from the nations that surround you, from them you may purchase slaves and maidservants.
Also, from the children of the [<b>uncircumcised</b>] sojourners who reside with you from them you may purchase [slaves], and from their families that live among you that were born in your land. [All these] shall be your permanent possession.
You shall will them as inheritance to your children after you as hereditary property; you shall keep them in servitude permanently. However regarding your bretheren, Bnei Yisroel, man over his brother, you must not rule over him [<b>make him work</b>] to crush him.
If a foreigner [<b>an uncircumcised one</b>] or resident acquires means while your brother becomes impoverished by him, and is sold to a [<b>an uncircumcised</b>] resident foreigner who resides with you or to the offspring [<b>a non-Jew</b>] of a foreign [<b>proselyte</b>] family.
After he is sold redemption shall be his, one of his bretheren shall redeem him.
Either his uncle [<b>father’s brother</b>] or his uncles son [<b>the son of his father’s brother</b>] (cousin) shall redeem him or the closest (other) family relative shall redeem him. If he obtains sufficient means of his own he may be redeemed [on his own.]
He shall reckon with the one who bought him. [According to the number of years] from the year which he was sold to him until the jubilee year. His purchase price shall be [proportional] to the number of years; at the rate of the days of a hired hand it shall be [considered as he worked] with him.
If there are yet many years [until the jubilee] accordingly shall he return his redemption money from his purchase price.
If there remain but a few years until the jubilee year, he shall make a [similar] calculation, based on the number of years he shall return his redemption money [to the purchaser.]
As a hired hand [working] on a yearly basis shall he be considered with him; he shall not rule over him [<b>make him work</b>] to crush him before your eyes.
If he is not redeemed through these means he then goes out in the jubilee year, he, along with his children.
For, Bnei Yisroel are My servants. They are My servants whom I have brought out of the land of Egypt, I am Adonoy, your God.

Chapter 26

You shall not make [<b>false</b>] idols for yourselves and graven images and memorial stones you shall not raise up for youselves, and a prostration stone you shall not set in your land upon which to prostrate oneself, for I am Adonoy, your God.
You shall keep [<b>the days of</b>] My Shabbosos and you shall fear (revere) [<b>the House of</b>] My Sanctuary, I am Adonoy.
If you follow My statutes and keep My commandments and you will fulfill them,
I will provide your rains in their proper time. The earth shall give forth its produce and the tree of the field shall give forth its produce.
[Because of the abundant produce] threshing will overtake the grape harvest and the grape harvest overtake the [time to] plant, and you will eat your bread to satiation and you will live securely in your land.
I will grant peace in the land; you will lie down (sleep) [<b>rest</b>] without disturbance (fear). I will banish [<b>nullify</b>] evil beasts from the land, and no [<b>people who kill with a</b>] sword shall pass through your land.
You will pursue your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword.
Five of you will pursue one hundred and one hundred of you will pursue ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword.
I will turn [<b>with My Word to do good</b>] to you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and establish My covenant with you.
You will eat the old [store] long kept and the old [store] you will have to clear out because of the new.
I will set My Sanctuary among you and My spirit [<b>Word</b>] will not loathe (reject) you.
I will walk [<b>rest My Shechina</b>] among you and I will be a God for you, and you will be My [<b>before Me for a</b>] people.
I am Adonoy your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt from where you were slaves, and I broke the bars of your yoke [<b>of the peoples from you</b>] and led you forth standing upright [<b>to freedom</b>].
And if you will not listen to Me [<b>accept My Word</b>] and you will not fulfill all of these commandments.
If you despise My statutes and your souls loathe [<b>reject</b>] My laws so as not to fulfill all My commandments, thereby breaking [<b>changing</b>] My convenant.
Then I will do the same with you. I will impose terror upon you, [which causes] swelling and fever that consume [<b>darken</b>] the eyes and fill the soul with grief. You will plant [your seeds] in vain because your enemies will consume [your crops.]
I will set my face [<b>anger</b>] against you and you will be defeated [<b>smitten</b>] before your enemies; your foes will rule over you and you will flee [even] when no one is pursuing you.
If after these [catastrophes] you still do not listen to Me [<b>accept My Word</b>], then I will increase your punishment sevenfold, as your sins.
I will break the pride [<b>glory</b>] of your power. I will make your [<b>the</b>] heavens [<b>which are above you</b>] like [<b>as strong as</b>] iron [<b>to bring no rain down</b>] and your [<b>the</b>] land [<b>which is beneath you</b>] like [<b>as powerful as</b>] copper [<b>producing no fruit</b>].
Your strength will be exhausted in vain. Your land will not yield its produce and the tree[s] of the land will not give forth its produce.
If you walk contrary to [<b>before</b>] Me and have no desire to listen to Me [<b>accept My Word</b>], I will increase [<b>to bring</b>] the blows upon you sevenfold, as your sins.
I will send [<b>incite</b>] among you wild animals of the field and they will make you bereft of children, destroy your cattle, reduce your [population] and make your roads into wasteland.
If after these [catastrophes] you have not been disciplined [to listen] to Me [<b>My Word</b>], and walk contrary to [<b>before</b>] Me,
[Then] I, too, will walk contrary to you; and I shall also smite you seven fold, for your sins.
I will bring [<b>people who kill with a sword</b>] an avenging sword upon you avenging the covenant [<b>and they will avenge from you a vengeance for transgressing the words of the Torah</b>] You will be huddled [in your cities]. I will send [<b>incite</b>] pestilence among you and you will be given into the hand of the enemy.
When I break the staff of your bread [<b>food</b>], ten women will bake your bread in one oven and they will return your bread by weight. You will eat but you will not be satiated.
If [in spite] of this you [still] will not listen to Me [<b>accept My Word</b>], and you will walk contrary to [<b>before</b>] Me,
I will walk contrary to you in fury, and indeed I too shall punish you sevenfold, for your sins.
You will eat the flesh of your sons and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.
I will destroy your high places and I will smash your sun images. I will set your corpses upon the carcasses (remains) of your [<b>false</b>] idols, and My soul [<b>word</b>] will loathe [<b>reject</b>] you.
I will turn your cities into ruins and bring your Sanctuaries into desolation. I will no longer scent (accept favorably) the fragrance of your offerings [<b>the offering of your gatherings</b>].
I will make the land [so] desolate that your enemies who live on it will be astonished.
I will scatter you among the nations and unsheath [<b>incite people who kill with</b>] the sword after you. Your land will be desolate and your cities will be in ruins.
The land will then be appeased for its Shabbosos [<b>rests</b>] [during] all the days of its desolation while you are in the land of your enemies. Then the land will rest and be appeased for its Shabbosos [<b>rests</b>].
All the days that it lies desolate it shall have its rest—the rest it did not have on your Shabbosos [<b>rests</b>] when you were living upon it.
To those who survive among you, I will send timidity [<b>brokenness</b>] into their hearts [as they live] in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a blown leaf [<b>beating</b>] will put them to flight and they will flee as though fleeing from [<b>before people who kill with</b>] a sword; and they will fall with no one chasing them.
They will stumble over one other as though before [<b>people who kill with</b>] a sword when there is no pursuer, and you will have no power to stand upright before your enemies.
You will be lost among the nations and the land of your enemies will consume you.
Those of you who survive will rot away [<b>melt</b>] in their iniquity in the land of your enemies, and also due to the iniquities of their [<b>evil</b>] ancestors which are [still] with them [<b>they hold in their hands</b>], [they] will they rot away [<b>melt</b>].
They will [then] confess their iniquities and the iniquities of their ancestors in the unfaithfulness [<b>dishonesty</b>] with which they were unfaithful [<b>dishonest</b>] to [<b>before</b>] Me, and also for walking contrary to [<b>before</b>] Me.
I, too, will go contrary to them and bring them into the land of their enemies. Or perhaps then will be humbled [<b>broken</b>] their uncircumcised (unyielding) [<b>unwise</b>] heart and then their iniquities will be appeased (forgiven).
I will [then] remember My covenant with Yaakov and also My covenant with Yitzchok and also My covenant with Avrohom, I will remember and I will remember the land.
The land, being bereft of them, will be appeased for its Shabbosos [<b>rests</b>], during the time of its desolation from them and their iniquities will then be appeased (forgiven) [<b>I will bring upon them curses instead of blessings</b>] since what certainly caused [this] is that they despised My laws and their soul loathed (rejected) My statutes.
All this not withstanding, even when they are in the land of their enemies I will not despise [<b>abandon</b>] them and I will not loathe [<b>reject</b>] them to annihilate them, to break [<b>change</b>] My covenant with them, for I am Adonoy, their God.
I shall remember for them the covenant of their ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in sight of the nations to be a God for them, I am Adonoy.
These are the statutes, the laws and the teachings that Adonoy set between Himself [<b>His Word</b>] and between Bnei Yisroel, on Mount Sinai, through the hand of Moshe.

Chapter 27

Adonoy spoke to Moshe, saying;
Speak to Bnei Yisroel and say to them; when a person [orally] expresses a vow pledging valuation of souls, to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
The valuation for a male shall be, from twenty years of age to sixty years of age your valuation shall be fifty holy silver <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>].
If it be a female, the valuation shall be thirty <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>].
If from five years of age to twenty years of age the valuation for a male shall be twenty <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>], and for a female, ten <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>].
If from one month of age to five years of age the valuation of a male shall be five silver <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>] and the valuation for a female is three silver <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>].
If from sixty and above, if he is a male the valuation shall be fifteen <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>] and for a female, ten <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>].
If he is [too] poor to pay the valuation he shall set him[self] [=he shall be presented] before the <i>kohein,</i> and the <i>kohein</i> will determine his valuation. According to the means of the one who vowed the <i>kohein</i> will determine his valuation.
If [it is] an animal which can be brought as an offering to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, any of it that he will give to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy shall become sacred.
He shall not exchange it [with anothers animal] and he shall not change it [with his own animal] whether it be a good one for a worse one [or] a bad one for a better one. If he did exchange one animal for another animal, then both it and its replacement shall be sacred.
If it is any unclean (blemished) animal which cannot be offered to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, he shall present the animal to the <i>kohein.</i>
The <i>kohein</i> shall determine its value whether it is good or bad as the <i>kohein</i> determines its value for you, so shall it be.
If he will indeed redeem it he shall add on one fifth to its valuation.
If a man will consecrate his house as being sacred to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, the <i>kohein</i> shall determine its value, whether it is good or bad; as the <i>kohein</i> determines its value, so shall it be established.
If he who consecrated [his house] wishes to redeem his house, he shall add one fifth to its valuation money in addition to [the valuation], and [then] it belongs to him.
If from his ancestral field a man will consecrate to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy its valuation shall be according to the measure of its seed; [at the rate of] one chomer [<b>kor</b>] of barley seed per fifty silver <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>].
If immediately after the jubilee year he consecrates his field it shall be established according to its vaulation.
If after the jubilee he consecrates his field, then the <i>kohein</i> shall calculate the money [due] according to the remaining years until the jubilee year, and its valuation should be reduced accordingly.
If he will [indeed] redeem the field, he who consecrated it, shall add one fifth to its monetary valuation, and it is then established as his.
If he does not redeem the field and if he sells the field to another person, it shall not longer be redeemable.
When the field is then released by the jubilee it becomes sacred to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy, just as a field that was consecrated, it shall belong to the <i>kohein,</i> [as] his possession.
If it is a field that he purchased, that is not his ancestral field, [that] he consecrates to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
The <i>kohein</i> will calculate for him the amount of its valuation until the jubilee year, and on that day he shall give its valuation as something sacred to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
In the jubilee year the field shall revert to him from whom it was purchased; to him whose ancestral land it is.
All of your valuations shall be in holy <i>shekalim</i> [<b>selaim</b>]; the <i>shekel</i> [<b>sela</b>] shall be twenty <i>geirah</i> [<b>ma’in</b>].
However, a firstling [animal] that is born first shall belong to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy [as a sacrifice] from among the domestic animals; a man shall not consecrate it [for any other purpose] whether it is an ox or a lamb, it belongs to Adonoy.
If it is of an unclean animal, he shall redeem it based on the valuation, and add a fifth to [that amount]. If it is not redeemed, it shall be sold according to the valuation.
However, any dedication that a man will dedicate to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy from any of his belongings be it people (slave), or animal, or of the field of his ancestral land, [none of these] can be sold or redeemed. Everything that is dedicated is most holy, unto [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
Any dedication that a man will dedcate, regarding a man [due to be put to death] cannot be redeemed, he shall surely be put to death.
All tithings of the land; whether of the seeds [crops] of the land or of the fruit of the tree, belongs to Adonoy, it is sacred to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
If a man wishes to redeem of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to [the amount].
All tithes of cattle and sheep, anything that passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be sacred to [<b>before</b>] Adonoy.
He shall not make a distinction between better or worse [animals] and he shall not exchange it. If he exchanges one for another, then [both] it and its replacement shall be sacred and it cannot be redeemed.
These are the commandments which Adonoy commanded Moshe for Bnei Yisroel on Mount Sinai. <b>Chazak</b>
