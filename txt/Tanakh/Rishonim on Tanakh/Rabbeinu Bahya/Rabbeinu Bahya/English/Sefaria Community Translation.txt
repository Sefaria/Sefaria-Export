Introduction



I know that the works of the Torah commentators break down according to a four part structure and approach. There are those who pursue the pshat, the plain meaning of the text. There are those who long for the way of midrash, the literary and exegetic meaning. Some choose the way of the intellect and philosophical investigation. Then there are those elevated ones, whose hearts seek the path to the house of God. Their hearts are sated with fatness and they eat dripping honey from the comb. They have entered into the place of the seer, further than the oracles, grasping root and branch. Therefore I saw fit to split my commentary into four parts according to these various paths, in order that all the pieces should be made whole.

And there was evening and there was morning, the third day. During these three days, evening and morning were mentioned, but there were no lights that would obligate the evening and morning. Because the setting of the sun is the evening and its rising is the morning, however, in these three days, evening and morning were mentioned not with regard to the light, but with regard to the celestial sphere, which turns and revolves, because every part of the firmament, when it rises, is its morning, and when it sets, it is its evening. But from the fourth day and onwards, when the luminaries were created, evening and morning were mentioned with regard to the light.

And know that in this Torah portion there is an explanation as to what occurred between Jacob and his brother Esau (and it is also a hint for [future] generations as to what will always happen in the future with the children of Esau) that enables us to ascribe to Jacob three discrete ways of being - towards war, towards gifts, and towards gifts. "Towards war" as it is written "and he divided the people with him" and as it is written "thinking, 'if Esau comes..." etc. (Genesis 32:8-9); "Towards prayer" as it he said "O God of my father Abraham...Deliver me" (Genesis 32:10-12); "Towards gifts" it is written  "200 she goats and 20 he goats, etc." (Genesis 32:15). [This is the case as well with] King Hezekiah who also ascribed these three ways of being as it is seen regarding Senacherib, King of Ashur, as it is written [regarding an orientation towards gifts]: "And Hezekiah gave him all the money" (2 Kings 18). And it is written [regarding an orientation towards war] "And he gave the nation to the ministers of war" (II Chronicles 32), and it is written [regarding an orientation towards prayer] "And Hezekiah prayed before God" (2 Kings 19). And thus we also need to go according to the directions of our ancestors and establish for ourselves a way of being to receive their faces [i.e. that follows in their ways] as gifts by way of refined speech; as prayer [by coming] before God the Exalted; however as war, it is impossible as it says "I have sworn with you daughters of Jerusalem, etc." (Song of Songs 2). They have sworn not to arouse themselves to war with the nations.  

Shemot



Chapter 1



Verse 1

Like a ring of gold, a golden ornament Is a wise person's reproof in a receptive ear. (Proverbs 25:12)
...In this verse, King Solomon, of blessed memory, teaches the virtue of accepting reproof and criticism. Torah depends on one’s ability to accept reproof. The highest virtue is found in the one who accepts criticism and listens to the one who rebukes him. It is the basis for the fulfillment of the Torah. One who rejects reproof is marked by a repulsive virtue containing the worst evils. To reject criticism causes one to reject the yoke of the commandments.  Regarding this, Solomon wrote: "Discipline is worse than the one who abandons God's way; he who hates rebuke will die."  (Prov. 15:10)  This means that one who rejects reproof is worse than the person who abandons the observance of Torah since such a person is guilty of denying the yoke of commandments. A person who abandons the path of Torah may face punishment but he is not condemned to death. One who rejects reproof is not pardoned through suffering but is sentenced to death. This is what King Solomon meant when he said, "He who hates rebuke will die." It is not enough for him to face painful suffering as a judgment…Conversely, Solomon explains that reproof is like a thing of beauty just as earrings are adornments to the body. When a wise person presents criticism to a person who is receptive to the criticism, the criticism is compared to an earring or an adornment which beautifies the soul of the individual.  There are two types of people with regard to reproof: those whom we are obligated to criticize and those whom we should avoid criticizing. There are three types of people whom one is obligated to criticize: the wise, the simple and the youth. There are three types of people to whom one should avoid offering reproof: scoffers, fools and the wicked.  Regarding scoffers, we are taught, "Do not rebuke the scoffer for he will hate you." (Prov. 9:8) … Regarding fools, it is written, "Do not speak to the fool for he will disdain your sensible words." (Prov. 23:9) The scoffer hates the person who criticizes him while the fool makes light of the words of reproof and mocks the person who is wiser than they are.  Regarding the wicked, it is stated, "…to rebuke the wicked person for his blemish is to call down abuse on oneself." (Prov. 9:7) This means that when one criticizes the wicked and points out his blemish, the wicked responds by casting his own blemish back on the one who rebuked him. The people to whom one should offer reproof include the wise. It is written, "Reprove the wise person and he will love you." (Prov. 9:8) Sometimes a wise person needs to be criticized when he accidently sins or does so by chance. Regarding the simple, it is written, "Endow the simple with shrewdness." (Prov. 1:4) Regarding the young, Scripture states "(He endows) the young with knowledge and foresight." (ibid) The most important type of reproof is the criticism offered to the young since their intellect is not fully developed and they lived under the domination of the evil inclination for the thirteen years when their thoughts and understanding were completely focused on worldly pleasures of the body. While they are still adolescents and their nature is malleable, young people are in need of criticism to rein in their behavior and to help them come under the control of their good inclination. They gain this by listening to the person who reproves them and by paying attention to words of Torah which is entirely reproof. It is written, "The way to life is the rebuke that disciplines." (Prov. 6:23) If a person was allowed to follow his basic nature, whether good or bad, he would not be able to separate himself from his youthful behavior when he reached the full maturity, as it is written, "Train a lad in the way he ought to go; he will not swerve from it even in his old age." (Prov. 22:6) Thus, a person acquires great benefit and merit for himself (by accepting criticism when he is young.) Because of this Solomon advises us to offer reproof to a young person with 'the rod of discipline,' "if folly settles in the heart of a lad, the rod of discipline will remove it." (Prov. 22:15) This means that even if the folly has attached itself to his heart and he has become accustomed to acting in this fashion for many years, do not despair and say, 'There is no way to make him improve,' for as long as he is a lad and the rod of discipline is used, he can remove it. By disciplining him little by little, the reproof will eventually enter his heart. When the word of the disciplinarian is soft so and offered with constancy it will eventually make an impression on the one who is disciplined just as drops of water which are soft and pleasing eventually leave a hole in a rock (upon which the water drips).  But if a person despairs and does not try to offer a young person reproof, it is as if he hates him, as it is stated: "He who spares the rod, hates his son; but he who loves him disciplines him early," (Prov. 14:23) The Midrash interprets this verse: "He who spares the rod, hates his son," refers to King David, while "He who loves him, disciplines him early," refers to Jacob, teaching that one who withholds discipline in the end will cause his children to follow evil company. We find this to be the case with Abraham who spoiled Ishmael and eventually he followed evil company…similarly Isaac spoiled Esau so that he left his father to follow evil company… David spoiled Adoniyah and Abshalom causing them to follow evil company… "He who loves him disciplines him early" refers to Abraham in the case of Isaac and Isaac in the case of Jacob. Similarly because Jacob disciplined his sons, there was no unworthy sons among them. Because he was a wise disciplinarian and the sons were attentive to him they became like refined gold made into earrings and they were truly the children of their father's legacy. 

Verse 2

Reuben Simon Levi and Judah Issachar Zebulun and Benjamin. The first six, are the sons of Leah according to their birth order, and it was appropriate to mention Benjamin last of all his brothers since he was the youngest among them - and further he was mentioned last  because the lower world is divided into seven climes, and the seventh clime is the Land of Israel, which is the middle of civilization, and it is the point that is colder and hotter than the rest of the countries because it is at the center of the furthest reaches;  and therefore it was written “Benjamin  was the seventh” to allude to the temple in the seventh clime  which is in the portion [of the tribe of Benjamin's] and even though  the wise scholars who ordered the climes wrote in some of their essays that the Land of Israel is in the fourth clime, "everything goes to one place" [Eccles. 3:20] since the Land [of Israel] is the [central] point and there are three climes from here and three climes from here, it is the fourth to each group of three; it is  simultaneously the middle and the seventh; this is similar to the Sabbath day which is the middle of the days of the week and is the seventh day and our Rabbis of blessed memory did not need to inform us that the lights (e.g. Sun and Moon) were created on the fourth day except to publicize the superiority of the Shabbat.

Verse 6

<b>And Yosef died, and all his brothers and all that generation.</b> Reuven was born on the 12th of Kislev and died at 125. Shim'on was born on the 21st of Tevet and died at 120. Levi was born on the 16th of Nisan and died at 137, Yehuda was born on the 15th of Nisan and died at 119, Dan was born on the 9th of Elul and died at 125 years, Naftali was born on the 5th of Tishrei and died at 133, Gad was born on the 10th of Marcheshvan and died at 125, Asher was born on the 20th of Shevat and died at 123, Yisaschar was born on the 10th of Av and died at 122, Zevulun was born on the 7th of Tishrei and died at 114, Yosef was born on the 1st of Tammuz and died at 110, Binyamin was born on the 11th of Marcheshvan and died at 109 years. In Adar and Iyyar no-one was born, and those were left for Efrayim and Menashe, I found this in "Midrash Tedashe" [תדשא]. <b>And Yosef died, and all his brothers and all of that generation.</b> Our rabbis of blessed memory explained: even though Yosef died, their God exists, as it says <b>And Yosef died</b> and juxtaposed to it <b>and the children of Yisrael were fruitful and teemed and grew and became very very mighty</b> (Shemot 1:7). The verse teaches you that before the subjugation this blessing of teeming and might was sent among them, and after the subjugation began, they left off [lit. "breathed out from"] teeming and might, but fruitfulness and growth remained among them, and this is what it means as it says, <b>"and as they oppressed them, so they multiplied and so they spread out"</b> (Shemot 1:12)
And a midrash: <b>"The children of Yisrael were fruitful and teemed"</b> (Shemot 1:7). "were fruitful" - what was their growth? The Torah says, "and they teemed" - six in one belly, as these teeming things. Perhaps they were low like teeming things? The Torah says "and grew" - they were tall. Perhaps they were weak? The Torah says "and became mighty". "Very very" - "very" in this world and "very" in the next, as it says <b>"And you shall say to yourself, who birthed me these?"</b> (Yeshayahu 49:21)

Verse 23

“And their outcry due to the labor went up to the Lord.” They were not worthy of redemption even though the end [of the exile] had already come. But because their labor caused them to cry out to God, He accepted their prayers. The verse mentions twice “due to the labor”: “And the Israelites groaned and cried out due to the labor, and their outcry due to the labor went up to God.” This shows that the prayer a person recites when in trouble and under duress is more wholesome and acceptable and goes straight up to God! Similarly, you will find that the Prophet Jonah inferred this when he said (Jonah 2:8): “When my soul grew faint upon me, I remembered the Lord and my prayer came to You, to Your Holy Temple.” The prophet said clearly that a prayer which is recited when one is suffering and faint, is a prayer that will come before God in His Holy Temple.  
It is possible that this Torah section is hinting to our future redemption which depends on our repentance and prayers. In the Egyptian redemption, they repented and prayed to God who answers at a time of suffering, and their prayer was accepted and the redeemer came immediately. That’s why these verses follow it: “And Moshe was a shepherd with Jethro’s sheep… and he saw and behold the bush was on fire… and now go and I will send you to Pharaoh and take my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.” This hints that the coming of the redeemer depends on repentance and prayer.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

And Moshe was herding...
...According to the simple interpretation, this section is teaching that Moshe achieved three levels: Fire, Angel, and Divine Presence. First he saw the fire which was flashing in the bush but the bush was not consumed. He saw this with his actual physical eye while he was awake; when he saw the bush burning he thought it was a fire of (the) pitch from beneath (the bush).Thinking that, and seeing that the bush was not being consumed, he chose to come closer as it says, "I will turn now and see this wondrous sight," meaning, "I will see this wonderment if the bush is different than normal wood, or the fire is different from other fires." If he had realized it was a heavenly fire, he would not have approached. Once he saw this fire he became stronger through seeing the angel, as it says, "And he saw an angel of G-d in the flame within the bush." This means that first he saw the flame, and only after did he see the angel within the fire. Once he became stronger through seeing the angel, he saw the Divine Presence in a prophetic vision. This is the meaning of, "And G-d saw that he tunred to see, and He called to him." Because this was the beginning of Moshe's prophecy, G-d wanted to orient him little by little and lift him up from one (spiritual) level to the next until his mind would be strong enough.This can be compared to someone who is sitting in a dark house for a long time. If he exits suddenly and looks at the sun his vision will be darkened. Therefore he must look at the light slowly until he becomes accustomed to it. The same way it works with physical light is how it works with the enlightenment of the mind; all mind-related things work similarly to physical things; the traits of the soul are related to the traits of the body.
We find the same thing with the Jewish People; when G-d inaugurated them in the Torah he did it in small steps. First He gave them some mitzvos at Marah, namely Shabbos and civil laws, and then He taught the Ten Commandments at Sinai, and the rest of the Torah was taught at Moab (just prior to entering the Land of Israel - ed.). We therefore find when it comes to comprehending G-d, a person must first inaugurate (train?) his mind a little at a time, and in that way his comprehension will continue to expand, like the light of dawn which starts to shine a little and then expands. This is what is meant by the verse of the prophet Hosea, "And we will know, we will chase after knowledge of G-d and find Him like the dawn." This verse teaches that there are people who don't know how to chase (knowledge of G-d) and rather try to accomplish everything in one moment. In response to such a person the verse says you must know how to chase, which is like the dawn, meaning a little at a time.

.... This is also the mystical aspect of our sages’ saying (Shevuot 20), “the words "zachor" and "shamor" were said as one,” for "zachor" is the attribute of compassion, and "shamor" the attribute of justice, and so the voice with "zachor" and "shamor" is the attribute of compassion within the attribute of justice. This was also why there were two tablets, five against five, one tablet corresponding to the attribute of compassion and the second tablet, on which there also five statements, with five negative statements and beginning with "do not murder," corresponding to the attribute of justice, and for this reason, they were two, and not all of the statements were on a single tablet. And Moshe our Teacher, a"h, who reached HaShem the special One, _he_ is the attribute of tif'eret, he would hear "zachor," and all of Israel "shamor." ...

According to the Midrash "and you shall make a guardrail on your roof for the faller will fall from it", he was apportioned to fall from the time of the six days of creation, but you do not need to cause that his death should be on your hands. The idea of this Midrash is that all the creation in their entirety were creation at their request and desire, and the Holy One B"H informed them in the beginning of the creation all of their [related] matters and all that would befall them in the future. And also informed them of the days of their lives and deaths, and how they would occur. And how they would sustain themselves if with spirit or difficult, if independently or with the aid of others. And so our Rabbis have explained that all of the process of creation was performed with its knowledge and with its characters it was created, as it says "and all his legions", and they accepted and desired all; and accordingly they [the Rabbis] said 'he was apportioned to fall from the time of the six days of creation'. And Nevertheless their is a great punishment for those that [surround?], and so we make a guardrail on our roofs.

Do not despise the Edomite... Even though you ought to despise him, because he went out with the sword for you; and the Egyptians also, even though they drowned your male [children] in the Nile, do not detest them, because they provided you a lodging in an hour of distress and fled to them in the days of famine and were treated with great honor.... And it is said of both of them, "Thou shalt not detest," the Edomite that met them with the sword, and the Egyptians that drown them in the water, whereas with Ammon and Moab, the sin made them loathsome, and Scripture says, "Do not inquire for their well-bring or their good." From here do the Sages deduce that one who causes a man to sin is worse than the one who kills him--a killer takes a man from This World and the inciter takes him from this world and the hereafter.

“Like an eagle arousing its nest;” [The text] compares [God’s] honor (kavod) to the eagle. Just as the eagle is the king of the birds, honor is perceived as the “king” of all dispersed minds, hinted in “and from there they dispersed” (Genesis 2:10). Just as the eagle takes its young, carrying them on top of its wings, guiding them to various places, so God “alone, guides them”, that is, the Jewish people, God did not employ the help or assistance of any other deity. We have a similar verse (Psalms 73:25) “Whom else do I have in heaven except You?” We rely neither on angels nor any other celestial forces but only on God directly. The text goes on saying: “having You I want no one on earth.” Furthermore, elaborating on the comparison with the eagle, “just as the eagle renews itself from time to time, so Israel does renew itself from time to time.” And just “eagles grow new plumes” (Isaiah 40:31) and “that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s” (Ps 103:5) so too honor renews itself when the Flow comes to it from Above, after it was stopped up due to the sins of Israel.
