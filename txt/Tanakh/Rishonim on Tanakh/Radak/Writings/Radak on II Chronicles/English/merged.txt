Radak on II Chronicles



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2

<i><b>Vayyomer</i> Solomon to all Israel … and Solomon and all the assemblage went.</b> This means: He told them (<i>amar la-hem</i>) to go <b>to the shrine at Gibeon</b>, the copper altar that <b>Moses had made</b>, and they went. This is similar to “<i>Vayyomer</i> the Lord to the fish and it spewed Jonah out” (Jonah 2:11): He told it to spew him out, and it did so. And the same for: “<i>Vayyomer</i> the Lord to the angel and he returned his sword to its sheath” (1 Chr 21:27).

Verse 13

<b>Solomon went <i>la-bamah asher be-Giv‘on</i> to Jerusalem.</b> The <i>lamed</i> of <i>la-bamah</i> is not in place of a <i>mem</i> as R. Jonah [ibn Janaḥ] has written (<i>Riqmah</i> 55–56), for one is the opposite of the other! After all, <i>lamed</i> indicates movement toward, while <i>mem</i> indicates movement away from—so how could one be in place of the other? Rather, the meaning is as follows: Solomon went—that is, he [first] went—<i>la-bamah asher be-Giv‘on</i> (=to the shrine at Gibeon); he [then] went to Jerusalem, [meaning] <b>from before the Tent of Meeting</b> that was in Gibeon he went to Jerusalem; <b>and he reigned over Israel</b>. In a midrashic vein, our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Yoma 53a), explain [the phrase] as follows: When Solomon went from Gibeon to Jerusalem, his face was <i>la-bamah asher be-Giv‘on</i> (=toward the shrine at Gibeon), just as it was when he went there; that is, out of respect for the shrine, when he left the building that it was in, he walked backward, facing the shrine. They derive from this (ibid.) that the same was true when the priests would take leave of their service, the Levites their stands, and the Israelites their posts: they would not turn back their faces and go but would turn them sideways. And the same holds true for a student taking leave of his mentor (ibid.).

Verse 14

<b>And he placed [the charioteers] in the chariot towns.</b> [This means]: in towns where horses were raised; that is, cattle country.

Verse 15

<b>As stones.</b> This is not referring to the value. Rather, it is that the gold and silver in Jerusalem were as plentiful as its stones: it is an exaggeration. In a midrashic source (y. Sanhedrin 13a) [we find]: “‘As stones’—and they did not get stolen? Rabbi Jose says: [They were like] stones of ten or eight cubits.”

Verse 16

<b>And Solomon’s holdings in the exportation of horses from Egypt.</b> [Addressing the parallel statement] in the book of Kings, my master, my father, of blessed memory, explained that Pharaoh transferred to him the expenses and profits generated by Egypt’s exportation of horses, which [Solomon] would then lease to merchants on a yearly basis. This, then, is [the meaning of]: “they would purchase the collection rights (<i>miqveh</i>) for a price” (1 Kgs 10:28)—the sense of <i>miqveh</i> is collection. In Kings <i>miqveh</i> is spelled with a <i>hei</i> and here with an <i>alef</i>, because the letters <i>alef</i>, <i>hei</i>, <i>vav</i>, and <i>yod</i> interchange.

Verse 17

<b>A chariot for six hundred [shekels of] silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty.</b> From here we derive that a chariot consists of four horses.
<b>By their hand (<i>be-yadam</i>) they would take out.</b> [This means]: with their permission; that is, all the kings who took horses out of Egypt would do so through (‘<i>al yad</i>) the merchants who purchased the exportation rights from King Solomon, and they would pay one hundred and fifty [shekels of] silver per horse.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>Solomon counted seventy thousand porters.</b> All these—the porters, the hewers, and the <b>supervisors</b>—were alien-converts, as it says just below, “Solomon counted all the alien-converts …” (v. 16).
<b>Three thousand six hundred.</b> But in Kings [it says] “three thousand three hundred” (1 Kgs 5:30)! Rashi, of blessed memory, explains (ibid.) that the three hundred [not included] were prefects over all of them. For the three thousand three hundred were appointed over the porters and hewers, who numbered one-hundred-and-fifty thousand combined—one thousand one hundred for each fifty thousand, as it says “and their supervisors: three thousand six hundred”—and three hundred of the six hundred were over all of them.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>This is Israel’s duty forever.</b> This means: This commandment—that of the offerings—is Israel’s duty forever, not just for a limited period; so I must build a good and strong Temple. In a midrashic vein, our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Menaḥot 110a), explain that this refers to scholars immersed in the laws of service: the text considers it to be as though the Sanctuary were built in their days.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>And in <i>argevan</i>.</b> This is the equivalent of <i>argaman</i>: the Targum renders <i>argaman</i>: “<i>argevana</i>” (Exod 25:4). It is a reddish color. 
<i><b>Karmil</b></i> is also a reddish color; but whereas <i>argaman</i> is the reddish color called <i>laque</i> (=lacquer), <i>karmil</i> is the worm-color <i>shani</i>; that is, crimson.

Verse 7

<b>And <i>algummim.</i></b> This is the equivalent of <i>almuggim</i> (1 Kgs 10:11). It refers to the red-colored wood called <i>‘al baqam</i> in Arabic and <i>Brasil</i> (=Brazilwood) in the vernacular. But some explain it to mean coral.

Verse 8

<b>Will be great and wondrous.</b> This means: [The Temple] will be great, and it will be wondrous in its greatness.

Verse 9

<i><b>Makkot</b></i> <b>for your servants.</b> This is akin to “as food (<i>makkolet</i>) for his household” in Kings (<i>1</i> 5:25). R. Jonah [ibn Janaִh] (<i>Shorashim</i> כתת) writes that this is of the root <i>ktt</i> (=to grind), so that it means ground wheat. But my master, my father, of blessed memory (<i>Zikkaron</i> p. 15), writes that it is from <i>nkt</i>, as in <i>ve-nakkitu</i>, the Targum of <i>vaynashekhu</i> (=and they bit; Num 21:6). [So it means]: “a bite for your servants,” as if to say “food.” This was food for the woodcutters; but what is mentioned in Kings was food for Hiram’s household, compensation for the use of his servants (1 Kgs 5:20, 25).

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>The son of a Danite woman.</b> But in Kings [it says], “[The craftsman] was the son of a widow, from the tribe of <i>Naphtali</i>” (1 Kgs 7:14)! It was his father who was from the tribe of Naphtali: the reason [his father] is called <b>a Tyrian</b> is that he <i>lived</i> in Tyre. Compare “Obed-edom the Gittite” (2 Sam 6:10): he was in fact a Levite (1 15:18), but he was called a Gittite because he lived in Gath. So this man, likewise, was called a Tyrian because he lived in Tyre. But his mother was from the tribe of Dan, as it says, “a Danite woman.”
<b>He is skilled at working in gold.</b> [This means] either that <i>he</i> was, or that his father was as well. The same is true in Kings for: “And his father had been a Tyrian, a coppersmith” (1 Kgs 7:14): “a coppersmith” may refer to him or to his father. Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Arakhin 16b), explain this to refer to his father, and they cite it to support [the principle] that a person is obligated to engage himself in his father’s craft. For the reason the text mentions his father is that he was a craftsman also, and his son learned his craft.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<i><b>Rafsodot</i> (=rafts).</b> This is the same as <i>doverot</i> in Kings (1 5:23): these consist of logs tied to one another at the front that are guided along rivers and the sea. That is why they are called <i>doverot</i>, which has the sense of guiding (<i>hanhagah</i>): the Targum of <i>vayyinhag</i> (Gen 31:18) is <i>u-devar</i>. They were also called <i>rafsodot</i>, however. In the Mishnah’s terminology [this is called] an <i>asda</i>: [concerning the phrase], “If he was sitting in a boat or an <i>asda</i>” (Ber. 4:6), the Talmud Yerushalmi [explains] (Berakhot 35b): <i>Asda</i>, <i>akhsera</i>, and <i>rafsodot</i> are one and the same.

Verse 16

<b>The <i>sefar</i> (=census).</b> This is a noun, in the pattern of <i>eyal</i> (=strength; Ps 88:5), <i>serad</i> (=service; Exod 39:1), and <i>she’ar</i> (=remnant; Isa 10:21).
<b>By which [Solomon’s] father David had counted [the alien-converts]</b>—as it says above: “David gave orders to assemble the alien-converts living in the land of Israel, and assigned them to be hewers” (1 Chr 22:2). But later on Solomon counted them again, because their numbers had grown since the time he became king. It is possible that these alien-converts were the remnant of the Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, and Jebusite nations, consistent with what the text says just below (8:7); for Solomon subjected them to forced labor “to this very day” (ibid. 8:8) to perform his tasks and [to work on] the cities he arranged to have built. They are called alien-converts (<i>gerim</i>) because they were not idol-worshipers; for in the days of David and Solomon, when the Israelites had the upper hand, they did not permit them to worship idols. It was on this condition that they permitted them to reside in the land; and David and Solomon made them into hewers, porters, and general laborers (v. 17).

Chapter 3



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>In the second month, <i>ba-sheni</i> (=on/in the second).</b> This means: on the second day of the week. Alternatively, it is a repetition, as in: “until the tenth month; in the tenth [month], on the first of the month” (Gen 8:5). Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Rosh Hashanah 3a), say that the text says <i>ba-sheni</i> is to impart that [the number of years of the reign of] Israelite kings is counted from Nisan. That is, it says “In the second month, in the second” because the month that is second in the yearly cycle is also second for counting [the years] of Israelite kings.

Verse 3

<b>It is these with which Solomon <i>husad</i> to build the House of God.</b> This means: These are the characteristics and the dimensions with which Solomon <i>husad</i> to build the House of God. <i>Husad</i> means “was advised,” akin to <i>yissad ha-melekh</i> (=the king established; Esth 1:8), <i>yissadta ‘oz</i> (=You have established strength; Ps 8:3), and <i>nosedu yaḥad</i> (=plotted with one another; Ps 2:2): they all have the sense of <i>yesod</i> (=a foundation), because advice and guidance (<i>sod</i>) for action is like a <i>yesod</i> (=foundation) for a building. Solomon received the advice and guidance for the construction of the Temple from his father David, as it says above, “David gave his son Solomon the plan of the porch” (1 Chr 28:11).
<b>By the former measure.</b> This means: by the measure by which the Tabernacle and its furnishings were made: this cubit is equal to that one. It says in the Mishnah (Kelim 17:10): “The cubit was six fistlengths for the building and five for the furnishings.”
<b>Sixty cubits.</b> The inner Sanctuary is included in this.

Verse 4

<b>The porch that, spanning the length, spanning the width of the Temple.</b> This means: The porch that was positioned along the width of the Temple spanned <b>twenty</b> cubits in length, because its length spanned the width of the Temple. Because the longer surface is called the length and the shorter one the width, the “length” of the porch spanned the “width” of the Temple.
<b>And the height [of the porch] was one hundred and twenty [cubits].</b> In the book of Kings the text does not mention the height of the porch, but it does mention the height of the Temple: “and the height was thirty cubits” (1 Kgs 6:2). It might be that the porch alone was this tall, and that it extended above the Temple. Alternatively, the entire Temple was the same height; and when it says in Kings “and its height was thirty cubits” it means from the floor of the Temple to the ceiling, whereas above the ceiling there were upper stories ninety cubits high, as it says “its storerooms and its upper chambers” (1 Chr 28:11). Indeed, it says [here], “and the upper chambers he overlaid with gold” (v. 9). But what I consider most likely is that the porch alone was this tall, because <i>it</i> contained the upper chambers. That is why the text relates the upper chambers to the porch when it says, “David gave his son Solomon the plan for the porch and its chambers, its storerooms, and <i>its upper chambers</i> and inner rooms” (1 Chr ibid.). After all, the description of the porch is not included with [that of] the Temple, nor is [the description of] the Temple included with [that of] the porch, either in the book of Kings or in this book. When the text says, “and the height was one hundred and twenty,” therefore, it refers to the porch alone. There cannot be an objection on the grounds that, because it says “and <i>the</i> height was one hundred and twenty” instead of “and <i>its</i> height,” it seems to refer to the entire Temple. After all, it says “spanning <i>the</i> length,” not “spanning <i>its</i> length.” When the text says, “David gave his son Solomon the plan for the porch,” this does not include the Great Hall and the inner Sanctuary. Rather, they are included in “and its chambers.” The text relates the Great Hall to [the porch] even though the Great Hall was longer than it: because the porch was the outer chamber, the text relates the inner chambers—that is, the Great Hall and the recesses in its walls—to the porch. It then mentions “the chamber of the Ark-cover” (1 Chr ibid.)—that is, the <i>Devir</i>, where the Ark was—which was the innermost chamber. But from what our Sages, of blessed memory, say, it seems that there were also upper chambers above the Great Hall and inner Sanctuary.

Verse 5

<b>The large chamber he paneled with cypress wood.</b> This is the Great Hall, which was the largest chamber; for its length was forty cubits.
<i><b>Timorim</i>.</b> [This means] figures of <i>temarim</i> (=palms).

Verse 6

<i><b>Parvayim</i>.</b> This is the name of a place. But our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Yoma 45a), explain that [the gold] was red like the blood of bulls (<i>parim</i>).

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>The Holy of Holies.</b> This is the inner Sanctuary.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>Sculptures of <i>ṣa‘aṣu‘im</i>.</b> This is the equivalent of <i>ṣe’eṣa‘im</i> (=offspring), as our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Sukkah 5b), say: “<i>Keruv</i> (=cherub): … <i>ke-ravia</i> (=like a baby),” for [the cherubim] had faces of children. But some (?) explain that they were sculpted in a <i>karkov</i>-like (=rounded) form, known in Arabic as <i>ṣan‘at kharrat</i>.

Verse 11

<i><b>Le-ammot ḥamesh</i> (=five cubits).</b> The <i>lamed</i> is like the <i>lamed</i> of <i>ve-ha-shelishi le-Avshalom</i> (=and the third one Absalom; cf. 1 Chr 3:2).

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Spread across twenty cubits</b>—as was the length of the Temple. But there was no need for the bodies of the cherubim to stand miraculously, because the bodies were under the wings.
<b>And they stood on their feet</b>—not like the ones Bezalel made, which were on the Ark at the two ends of its covering (Exod 37:6–9); for these stood on their feet on the floor of the Temple.
<b>Facing the Temple.</b> But concerning the ones Bezalel made it says, “facing one another” (Exod 37:9)! It is possible to explain that they were altered in this respect, just as they were altered in that they stood on their feet and were of olive wood overlaid with gold (1 Kgs 6:23, 28). But our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Bava Batra 99a), harmonize the two verses, saying that [the cherubim] faced sideways, akin to a student taking leave of his mentor.

Verse 14

<b>[Solomon] made the curtain.</b> He made a curtain even though the inner Sanctuary had doors (1 Kgs 31–32). For they were not closed, so that the poles would be seen upon the front of the inner Sanctuary.
<b>And he worked cherubim into it.</b> There were designs of cherubim on the curtain. The text says the same thing concerning the curtain in the Tabernacle: “he shall work cherubim into it” (Exod 26:31).

Verse 15

<b>Thirty-five cubits in length.</b> This refers to the measurement of the two columns together; for the height of one column was only eighteen (1 Kgs 7:15), and the same for the other—for a combined total of thirty-six. The reason the text says just thirty-five, though, leaving out one cubit, is that half a cubit of each was inserted into a capital. The reason the text provides the height of the two columns together is that when they were cast, they were cast as one. The proof is that it says “length,” implying that it is providing the measurement at the time of the casting; for when they were cast, their height was in fact length. In the book of Kings, however, the text provides their measurement after they were stood up in place, at which point they were vertical—so it provides their height. That is why it provides the measurement of each column independently—in height.
<b>And the <i>ṣefet</i>.</b> This is the <i>koteret</i> (=capital) mentioned in the book of Kings (1 7:16), for there was a capital on top of each column (ibid.). It was five cubits, as the text says here, “<b>five cubits</b>.” But at the end of the book of Kings it says, “the capital was <i>three</i> cubits” (2 Kgs 25:17)! Our Sages, of blessed memory (Baraita of the Forty-nine Principles), say: “The two bottom cubits of the capitals, which had no design, were identical to the columns, whereas the top three [cubits] extended outward by virtue of their surrounding design, as the text says, ‘nets of meshwork’ (1 Kgs 7:17): they were surrounded by the likeness of palm branches.” At the end of Kings, then, it only counts the three upper cubits that had the meshwork on them. That is why it says right afterward, “and there was a meshwork [decorated] with pomegranates about the capital” (2 Kgs 25:17)—for it is speaking only of the three upper cubits that had the meshwork on them. The reason the capital is called the <i>ṣefet</i> is that it was <i>ṣafuy</i> (=laid over) the column.

Verse 16

<b>[Solomon] made chainwork on the inner Sanctuary and he placed on top of the columns.</b> This is not saying that he placed the chainwork that was on the inner Sanctuary on top of the columns, for the columns were on the porch in front of the Great Hall! Instead, it means that he made chainwork on the inner Sanctuary, as the text says in Kings, “He inserted bars of gold chainwork in front of the inner Sanctuary” (1 Kgs 6:21); and, it proceeds to say, “he placed on top of the columns,” meaning that he placed [more] chainwork on top of the columns. But because it had already said “chainwork,” it leaves [the word] out and relies on the reader’s understanding. Such is the method of the text in many places.

Verse 17

<b>And [Solomon] called the [column] to the right <i>Yakhin</i> and the one to the left <i>Bo‘az</i>.</b> According to the plain sense, he called them this as a good omen: <i>Yakhin</i> in the sense of <i>hakhanah</i> (=securing), meaning that the Temple should be secured forever, and <i>Bo‘az</i> in the sense of <i>‘oz</i> (=strength)—it is a compound word: <i>bo ‘oz</i> (=there is strength in it)—meaning that God should give the Temple strength and endurance. Because the columns were at the entrance to the Temple, he called them names that would be a good omen for it.

Chapter 4



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Ten cubits from brim to brim.</b> That is, [the basin’s] diameter was ten cubits. Its circumference was thirty cubits, as the text says, “<b>a perimeter of thirty cubits encircled it</b>”; for anything with a circumference of three fistlengths has a diameter of one fistlength (b. Eruvin 14a).

Verse 3

<b>Figures of oxen were beneath it (<i>taḥat lo</i>), all around.</b> The word <i>lo</i> (=it) refers to <i>sefato</i> (=its brim) mentioned [above] (v. 2), as it says in Kings, “below the brim” (1 Kgs 7:24). Even though <i>safah</i> (=brim) is feminine, we nevertheless find <i>safah yihyeh</i> (=there shall be a binding; Exod 28:32) in the masculine. Alternatively, <i>lo</i> refers to <i>ha-yam</i> (=the basin; v. 2), and [<i>taḥat lo</i>] does not mean beneath it literally. Rather, it means that the figures of oxen were crafted into its lower portion. The oxen mentioned here are the <i>peqa‘im</i> mentioned in the book of Kings (1 7:24), which Targum Jonathan renders “egglike figures.” On this assumption, we must explain that their bodies were rounded in the shape of eggs, whereas their faces were in the likeness of those of oxen.
<b>Ten cubits surrounded the basin, all around.</b> Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Eruvin 14b), explain that the three lower cubits were square-shaped, and that the two upper ones were round—for the height of the basin was five cubits (v. 2). So the meaning of “ten cubits” is that the oxen were on the three lower cubits where the basin was square-shaped. That is, the text says “ten cubits” because each of the sides—upon which were the oxen—was ten cubits. The perimeter of the square-shaped portion of the basin was thus forty cubits, whereas the circumference of its upper portion was thirty cubits.
<b>Cast in its mold (<i>be-muṣaqto</i>).</b> The noun is <i>muṣeqet</i>, in the pattern of <i>moledet</i> (=birthplace; Gen 24:8), even though one is with a <i>ḥolem</i> and the other with a <i>shureq</i>. What is meant here is that these oxen were cast together with the basin, not emblazoned on it afterward.

Verse 4

<b>It stood above twelve oxen.</b> This verse, too, suggests that the basin was square-shaped at the bottom, for it enumerates four sides for it, akin to any square. On each side there were <b>three</b> oxen, with <b>the basin</b> standing <b>above them</b>.

Verse 5

<b>At capacity, it held three thousand <i>bath</i>s.</b> But in the book of Kings [it says], “Its capacity was <i>two</i> thousand <i>bath</i>s” (1 Kgs 7:26)! Our Sages, of blessed memory (Tosefta [Zuckermandel] Kelim Bava Metzia 5:2), explain: “Two thousand of liquids and three thousand of solids”: any vessel holds one-third more heaping solids than it does liquids, which cannot be heaped; for what extends above the vessel amounts to one-third of the vessel. They say similarly in the Mishnah (Kelim 15:1): “A chest, a box, a cupboard, or a straw basket … even with a flat bottom, is not susceptible to ritual impurity if it holds forty <i>se’ah</i>s of liquid, which is equivalent to two <i>kor</i>s of solid”—and two <i>kor</i>s of solid is sixty <i>se’ah</i>s.

Verse 6

<b>Five to the right and five to the left.</b> This means: to the right of Moses’ laver and to the left of it. And the same for the lampstands—five to the right of the lampstand that Moses made and five to the left of it (v. 7), and for the tables—five to the right of Moses’ table and five to the left of it (v. 8). Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Menaḥot 98b), explain it like this on the grounds that all of the lampstands were to the south, and all the tables to the north. This, after all, is where Moses placed them in the Tabernacle—the lampstand to the south (Exod 40:24) and the table to the north (Exod 40:22). But they have this debate (b. Menaḥot 99a): Some of them say that they would kindle Moses’ lampstand only and set up the rows [of bread] on Moses’ table only, as it says, “they kindle the golden lampstand with its lamps burning [each] evening” (2 Chr 13:11). And some of them say that they would kindle all of them, as it says, “the lampstands and their lamps, to burn as prescribed” (2 Chr 4:20), and set up the rows [of bread] on all of them, as it says, “the tables, with the bread of display upon them” (2 Chr 4:19). And even though each one reconciles his view with the verses, it is this [latter view] that appears correct: they would kindle or set up the rows [of bread] on all of them. When the text says “the golden lampstand” (cf. 2 Chr 13:11), this is to impart that even though he made ten of them, they would kindle those of Moses also.
<b>To wash with them; the parts of the burnt offering they would rinse off in them.</b> “The parts of the burnt offering” is an elaboration of “to wash with them”; that is: What did they wash with them? They rinsed off the parts of the burnt offering in them. Alternatively, the text elides a conjunctive <i>vav</i>: “<i>and</i> the parts of the burnt offering.” That is, the lavers were for washing, meaning for the priests’ washing their hands and feet—akin to the laver Moses made, concerning which the text says, “and let Aaron and his sons wash their hands and feet [in water drawn] from it” (Exod 30:19)—and they would <i>also</i> rinse off the parts of the burnt offering in them.
<b>And the basin, for the priests to wash in it.</b> This means: The laver was for the immersion of the priests, for they would immerse themselves in it [to cleanse themselves] from their impurity. The Talmud Yerushalmi (Yoma 19a) asks: “But was it not a vessel?” That is, how could they have immersed themselves in it? After all, it is a vessel, and immersion is ineffective in a vessel! And it replies: “Rabbi Joshua son of Levi said: A stream of water extended to it from the spring of Etam, and the feet of the oxen had openings the size of pomegranates.” That is, the water came to it from underground and would enter and rise up through the feet of the oxen, which were open and hollowed at the bottom.

Verse 7

<b>As prescribed.</b> This means: as prescribed for the lampstand made by Moses, with its cups and calyxes (Exod 36:17–22).

Verse 8

<b>[Solomon] made one hundred gold dashing instruments.</b> The text is not saying that these were for the sake of the tables. Rather, they were for dashing the blood on the altar. The only reason it mentions them with the tables is that it is listing the items that he made out of gold.

Verse 9

<b>And the large <i>‘azarah</i>.</b> This is the large court in which the Israelites would stand. It is called an <i>‘azarah</i> because when they prayed there, they would be <i>ne‘ezarim</i> (=helped).

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>And the four hundred pomegranates.</b> But above it says, “he made <i>a hundred</i> pomegranates and set them into the chainwork” (2 Chr 3:16)! The one hundred that the text mentions were for one row; and it had four rows of pomegranates, for a total of four hundred. Alternatively, there were pomegranates installed on the chainwork in addition to those installed on the pieces of network, and the pomegranates on the chainwork numbered one hundred, and those on the network numbered four hundred.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>Huram his father (<i>aviv</i>) made for King Solomon.</b> This means: Hiram made all these furnishings beautiful and of good quality <i>as</i> his father would have (<i>ke-aviv</i>), meaning just as they would have been made by his father who was widely known for his craftsmanship, as the text says above: “skilled … in gold, silver …” (2 Chr 2:13). In <i>aviv</i>, then, a prepositional <i>kaf</i> is elided. There are many cases like this, such as: “A joyful heart enhances [one’s health] <i>gehah</i>” (Prov 17:22), which means <i>ke-gehah</i> (=as does medicine).

Verse 17

<b>In the <i>‘avi ha-adamah</i> (=thickness of the earth).</b> This means that he cast them in the <i>‘avi ha-qarqa‘</i> (=depth of the ground), not that he made smelting pots in which to cast them—for that would not be possible for such large vessels. Targum Jonathan renders “in the <i>ma‘aveh ha-adamah</i> (=thickness of the earth)” (1 Kgs 7:46): [<i>be-‘ovi</i> (=in the thickness of)] <i>gargishta</i>, which is a red-colored soil from which smelting pots are made, for the purpose of casting metals.
<b>Between Succoth and Zeredathah.</b> In the book of Kings [it says], “and Zarethan” (1 Kgs 7:46): “Zeredathah” and “Zarethan” are phonetically similar.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

<i><b>Mikhlot</i> gold. </b>This is akin to “<i>kelei</i> (=items of) gold,” meaning: All the items on the lampstand were gold. But some explain “<i>mikhlot</i> gold” to mean “<i>kelil</i> (=of pure) gold”; that is, highly refined gold. [We find] the same in a rabbinic source (b. Menaḥot 29a): “Solomon made ten lampstands: for each one he brought one thousand [talents of] gold, and he placed it in a smelting pot one thousand times, turning it into one talent of gold.”

Verse 22

<b>Of the Great Hall—gold.</b> This means: overlaid with gold; for as it says in the book of Kings, the doors were of wood but they were overlaid with gold (1 Kgs 6:34–35).

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<b>Solomon brought the things that his father David had consecrated.</b> This refers to whatever was left over after all the work had been done.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>The Levites carried the Ark.</b> But in the book of Kings it says, “The priests carried the Ark” (1 Kgs 8:3)! It was the priests who carried it: the “Levites” to whom the text refers <i>are</i> the priests. After all, the priests were Levites, and our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Yevamot 86b), say that priests are called “Levites” in twenty-four places, including: “But the priests—the Levites—descended from Zadok” (Ezek 44:15). However, when the text says just below “the priests the Levites” (v. 5), it means the priests <i>and</i> the Levites. Indeed, in Kings this [phrase] appears with the word “and”: “the priests and the Levites brought them up” (1 Kgs 8:4). The priests carried the Ark, and the Levites the Tent of Meeting.

Verse 5

<b>They brought up the Ark and the Tent of Meeting.</b> This means: the Ark from Zion and the Tent of Meeting from Gibeon, where it had been. Indeed, it says in Kings: “Then Solomon convoked … to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David; that is, Zion” (1 Kgs 8:1). They hid away the Tent of Meeting in the treasuries of the House of the Lord with the consecrated things (v. 1); but they brought the Ark into its place—into the inner Sanctuary of the Temple (v. 7).

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>They extended (<i>vayya’arikhu</i>) the poles.</b> If these are the poles that had been on the Ark initially, it is a wonder how they could have been seen <b>upon the front of the inner Sanctuary</b>. After all, the poles were no more than ten cubits long. For the Holy of Holies in the Tent of Meeting was only ten, and the Ark was placed in it, and it does not say in the Torah that the poles were visible from outside the curtain. So if the width of the inner Sanctuary [of Solomon’s Temple] was <i>twenty</i> cubits (2 Chr 3:8), how could [the poles] have been seen upon the front of <i>it</i>? Possibly, they made other poles for the Ark that were longer than those, in order that they be seen upon the front of the inner Sanctuary. That would explain why the text says <i>vayya’arikhu</i>, which is a transitive verb, and not <i>vayya’arkhu</i>. It is also possible to explain that these <i>were</i> the same poles that were on the Ark initially. It might be that they were ten cubits long, and that before they brought the Ark into the inner Sanctuary, the poles were inserted into the Ark symmetrically, extending behind it the same distance as in front of it. After all, four people would carry it, each pole by two people: one in front and one in back. But when they brought the Ark into the inner Sanctuary in that state—with its poles—and it was no longer to be carried by shoulder, they extended the poles, pulling them outward until their tips were seen upon the front of the inner Sanctuary, so that the high priest might enter there on the Day of Atonement to offer incense between the poles without shifting in one direction or the other. For this reason, then, they extended the poles until the front of the inner Sanctuary, <b>although they could not be seen from the outside</b>, [meaning] outside the front of the inner Sancutary. And if you will ask: Still, because the poles were only ten cubits long, and the width of the inner Sanctuary was twenty, then how could they have been seen upon the front of it? Possibly, they did not place the Ark close to the west wall but far away from it. The way the wingspread of the cherubim extended over the Ark and its poles (v. 8) is that it was twenty cubits wide, as it was long (2 Chr 3:13). Alternatively, the width of the wings was equal to the width of the Ark and its poles. In a midrashic vein, our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Yoma 54a), say: “It says ‘the tips of the poles were seen’ and ‘but they could not be seen from the outside.’ How so? They pressed up against the curtain and protruded outward, so that they looked like the two breasts of a woman, as it says, ‘he sleeps between my breasts’ (Song 1:13).” But we have no need for this midrashic interpretation; for the text says that they were seen <i>upon the front</i> of the inner Sanctuary. They were not, however, visible from outside its wall. Nor do I know why they say (b. Megillah 10b) that the space occupied by the Ark is not part of the dimensions and that it was situated there miraculously. For the text says that the wingspread of the cherubim extended over the Ark (v. 8). The Ark, then, was under the wings of the cherubim and need not be included in the calculation. So what reason is there to impose a miracle where it is not necessary? What they say (b. ibid.) is that there were ten cubits to each side of the Ark. But we do not find that, nor is it possible according to the verses! Those who said this, however, knew what they were saying, because their understanding was greater than ours.
<b>It has remained there.</b> [This means]: the poles have remained there: “it has” is meant in a collective sense. In Kings, [the text indeed says] “<i>they</i> have remained there” (1 Kgs 8:8). It is saying that the poles remained there in that they were not subsequently removed—as it says, “they shall not be removed from it” (Exod 25:16)—and also that they were not moved back toward the other side. Instead, they remained extended to the front of the inner Sanctuary forever: that is the meaning of “<b>to this day</b>.” It emerges, then, that the doors on the opening to the inner Sanctuary were not closed. That it why [Solomon] had to make a curtain (2 3:14)—to serve as a partition.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>Without keeping to the set divisions.</b> After all, although [the priests] had already been divided into shifts, there were at that point so many sacrifices and such a large gathering that every single one of the priests and Levites was needed to serve or to sing praises.

Chapter 6



Verse 1

<b>To dwell in the <i>‘arafel</i>.</b> This means: [God] said that He would dwell among the Israelites in the <i>‘arafel</i>—that is, the cloud (‘<i>anan</i>)—as the text says, “I will dwell among the Israelites” (Exod 29:45). That is, His Presence would descend in the cloud on the site of the Sanctuary, to be worshiped. Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Yoma 53a), say that when [God] said “because I appear in the <i>‘anan</i> over the Ark-cover” (Lev 16:2), He in fact hinted to them that He would appear in the <i>‘anan</i> in the eternal Temple. Even though they also explain “in the <i>‘anan</i>” to mean in the smoke of the incense offering (ibid.), the plain sense of the verse is that it refers to the cloud of the Divine Presence. Indeed, in the Tabernacle, His Presence appeared in the cloud constantly, as the text says, “The Presence of the Lord appeared in a cloud” (cf. Deut 31:15), and: “and there, in a cloud, appeared the Presence of the Lord” (Exod 16:10). And [God] did as He said; for He caused His Presence to dwell in the <b>stately Temple</b> that I built for Him, descending in the cloud.

Verse 2

<b>Forever.</b> After all, Shiloh, Nob, and Gibeon were not forever: none of them were the chosen site, about which the text says, “to the site that the Lord will choose” (Deut 12:26). Instead, it was this site, Mount Moriah, on which Abraham bound his son Isaac (Gen 22:9), which he called “the Lord will see” (Gen 22:14), and [concerning which] he said, “the mountain upon which the Lord shall appear” (ibid.)—meaning that He will appear on that mountain for all generations. When David saw the response he received there—the fire that descended there from the heavens upon his burnt offerings—he knew that it was the chosen site, and he said: “This is the abode of … God, the altar of burnt offerings for Israel” (1 Chr 22:1).

<b>After all, <i>ha-umnam</i> (=is it really true that).</b> The <i>hei</i> has a <i>pataḥ</i> because it singals a rhetorical question. That is, is it really true that <b>God dwells</b> with <b>man on earth</b>? That is impossible to believe—for You are blessed and raised up over everything! You cannot have a place that contains You, because the world is contained in You, not You in the world. It is only in a metaphorical sense, then, that I built the Temple <i>for You</i>: it is so that Your glory should be in <b>this Temple</b>, along with Your readiness<b> to heed the prayers that</b> shall be offered to You <b>in this place</b>. Even though [God] readily heeds the prayers of those who cry out to Him with a sincere heart anywhere, Solomon requested of God that this chosen place help along the prayers of those who offer them, as though the Temple were a mediating angel: May You heed the prayers of all those who offer them in this Temple more quickly than those offered elsewhere.

<b>And <i>nasha</i> upon him an imprecation.</b> [This means]: if the law obligates him to swear—in the sense of: “When <i>tasheh</i> (=you make a loan) to your countryman, <i>masha’at me’umah</i> (=any kind of loan)” (Deut 24:10), which has the sense of obligation.
<b>The imprecation shall come.</b> This means: The one who must swear shall come to receive the imprecation <b>before Your Altar in this Temple</b>.

Verse 23

<b>And judge.</b> This means: Although You withhold Your anger even from one who swears falsely—and do not exact punishment from him at the time of his transgression—if he swears in this Temple do not withhold [Your anger] from him, so that people will recognize that this chosen place contributed to the quickness of the punishment and will be in awe of this Temple and in fear of it. All this is for Your honor. God too commanded so: “You shall be in awe of My Sanctuary” (Lev 19:30).
<b>Requiting him who is in the wrong by bringing down the punishment of his conduct on his head, and vindicating him who is in the right.</b> [“Him who is in the wrong” refers to] whichever one it might be: the one who swears—falsely; or the one who compels him to swear—needlessly, in which case the oath is taken truthfully and the punishment falls on the one who compels it.

Verse 27

<b>By showing them the proper way.</b> This means: May You advise them regarding which transgression the heavens have been stopped up, show them the proper way, <b>and provide rain</b>.

Verse 28

<b>In any malady and in any disease.</b> This means: Even though I have made specific mention of certain needs of Your nation Israel concerning which they might offer prayers before You, I am similarly referring to any malady or disease they might have. <b>Any prayer</b> or <b>any supplication</b> they offer before You, <b>pertaining to the concerns of any person or of Your nation Israel—</b>that is, for individuals or for the masses—<b>may You heed</b>, each and every man according to his malady or disease.

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b>So that they may revere You.</b> Seeing that You forgive them when they return to You and pray to You in this Temple, they will know that they contracted the malady or disease in punishment for a transgression, not by chance, and as a result they will revere You. This is also the meaning of: “Yours is the power to forgive, so that You may be held in awe” (Ps 130:4).

And similarly, <b>may Your loyal ones</b> who stay in Your Temple to pray and to learn Your ways [<b>rejoice in the good</b>]. Alternatively, “and Your loyal ones” refers to the Levites who would perform music in the Sanctuary.

Verse 42

<b>Do not reject Your anointed one.</b> [This means]: May all the prayers that I have offered before You be accepted by You.

Verse 3

<b>On the <i>riṣpah</i>.</b> The entire floor of the Temple is called a <i>riṣpah</i>, because it was <i>raṣuf</i> (=tiled) with marble. The point of mentioning that they knelt with their faces to the floor is that Solomon had been kneeling upon the laver, the place where he had been standing (2 Chr 6:13). Thus, they too bowed where <i>they</i> were—with their faces to the <i>riṣpah</i>.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>With the <i>hallel</i> of David <i>be-yadam</i> (=in/with their hands).</b> [This refers to] the musical instruments that David had made <i>le-hallel</i> (=to offer praise). Alternatively, “the <i>hallel</i> (=praising) of David” means that they would utter the psalms composed by David, and “with their hands” means that they would do so following the music of the instruments.

Verse 7

<b>Solomon consecrated the center of the court.</b> There is a debate on this among our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Zevaḥim 59a-60a). Some say that because of the large number of burnt offerings, he temporarily consecrated the floor of the court to make burnt offerings on it in addition to on the altar. And some say that he built another altar there to meet the temporary demand.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>For [the Israelites] observed the dedication of the altar seven days.</b> Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Moed Qatan 9a), say that they ate on the Day of Atonement. After all, the seven days prior to the Feast of Booths include the Day of Atonement, and the dedication was an occasion of celebration with peace sacrifices, food and drink. But this was not considered a transgression for them; for a heavenly voice burst forth and said: You are all designated for life in the World to Come.

Verse 10

<b>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month [Solomon] dismissed the nation.</b> But in the book of Kings it says, “On the eighth day he dismissed the nation” (1 Kgs 8:66), which is the twenty-<i>second</i> of the month! Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. ibid.), explain that on the eighth day they obtained his permission but that they did not set out on that day because it was a holiday. And the next day—that is, the twenty-third of the month—when they did set out, they obtained his permission again.

Verse 2

<b>The cities that Huram had given to Solomon.</b> But in the book of Kings the text says that <i>Solomon gave Hiram</i> twenty cities in the region of Galilee, and the only things it says Hiram gave to Solomon are cedar timber, cypress timber, and gold (1 Kgs 9:11)! It is possible to explain that Hiram gave cities in his land to Solomon, who settled <b>Israelites in them</b> in order to secure them, and that Solomon likewise gave cities in the Galilee to Hiram: all this was to secure the treaty between them. In Kings, then, it mentions what Solomon gave to Hiram, and in this book it mentions what Hiram gave to Solomon.

Verse 10

<b>These were King Solomon’s prefects—two hundred and fifty foremen over the people.</b> But in the book of Kings it says “five hundred and fifty” (1 Kgs 9:23)! The [additional] three hundred were alien-converts, who were prefects over three thousand three hundred [others], as we have written above (2 Chr 2:1). These two hundred and fifty, however, were Israelites, who were prefects over those three hundred, who were [themselves] prefects over the rest. In the book of Kings, then, the text counts all the prefects together—Israelites and alien-converts—who numbered five hundred and fifty. But in this book it does not count the alien-convert prefects, only the Israelite ones. For in saying “three thousand six hundred” (2 Chr 2:1), it counts the alien-convert prefects among the rest of the alien-converts: because the workers numbered only three thousand three hundred as it says in the book of Kings (1 5:30), it emerges that the [additional] three hundred were the prefects.

Verse 11

<b>In David’s house</b>—in a collective sense. This means to say: in any of David’s houses.
<b>For they are sacred.</b> Even though the Ark was in only one of the houses, which was consecrated for it, [Solomon] nonetheless considered all the houses to be consecrated, because the Ark had entered the area. So he declared: [Pharaoh’s daughter] “may not dwell with me” from this day on, now that I have built her a house. This, in fact, is the reason he built her a house—so that she not dwell in the sacred area. But even so, she did dwell there for twenty years until the work on his house was completed.
<b>The Ark of the Lord has entered (<i>ba’ah</i>) them.</b> The text refers to the Ark in the feminine. The same is true for: “And the Ark of God <i>nilqeḥah</i> (=has been captured)” (1 Sam 4:17).

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>They did not depart <i>miṣvat ha-melekh</i>.</b> This elides a prepositional <i>mem</i>: it means <i>mi-miṣvat ha-melekh</i> (=from the commandment of the king).

Verse 16

<i><b>Musad</i> the House of the Lord until its completion.</b> This also elides a prepositional <i>mem</i>, so that it means <i>mi-musad</i> (=from the founding of). That is, from the day of its founding until its completion, all the work was well-executed.

Verse 17

<b>At that time Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth.</b> This refers to his conquest of these cities and his construction of a ship there, as the text says in the book of Kings (1 9:26).

Verse 18

<b>Four hundred and fifty talents of gold.</b> But in the book of Kings it says “four hundred and twenty” (1 Kgs 9:28)! It might be that they used the thirty [additional] talents of gold for travel expenses.

Verse 11

<i><b>Mesillot</i> for the House of the Lord.</b> In the book of Kings, however, it says, “<i>mis‘ad</i> (=support) for the House of the Lord” (1 Kgs 10:12). What this means is the pillars that supported the ceilings.

Verse 12

<b>In addition to what she had brought to the king.</b> But in the book of Kings [it says], “in addition to what <i>Solomon gave her</i> in amounts befitting his royal affluence” (1 Kgs 10:13). What the verse means, then, is the following: King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything for which she expressed a desire, in addition to <i>what he gave her on his own to reciprocate for</i> what she had brought him. After all, he had to give her precious items on his own also, because she had brought him a large amount. So he did so: in amounts befitting his royal affluence, he reciprocated for what she had brought him, with items available in the land of Israel that were not available in her land. It is possible to explain, however, that what he gave the queen of Sheba was everything for which she had expressed an interest that pertained to [the resolution of] difficult questions and to matters of wisdom.
<i><b>Vattahafokh</i> (=and she turned around) and went back to her land.</b> This is akin to “and she turned and went back to her land” in Kings (1 10:13): it means that she turned her face around to go. The same is true for: “a man <i>hafakh</i> (=turned around) to meet you, descending from his chariot” (2 Kgs 5:26).

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>Besides that which the <i>tarim</i> and <i>soḥarim</i>.</b> <i>Tarim</i> are small-scale merchants, who have little merchandise or business. Because they have little business, they seek large profits when buying and selling.That is why they are called <i>tarim</i> (=seekers). <i>Soḥarim</i> are large-scale merchants.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>Three hundred [shekels of] gold.</b> In the book of Kings [it says] “three <i>mina</i>s” (1 Kgs 10:17), because a <i>mina</i> is one hundred [shekels] of gold.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>Attached to the throne.</b> This means: The stairs were attached to the throne and flush up against it, and the <i>kevesh</i> (=ramp), which was of gold, was in front of the stairs. <i>Kevesh</i> is to be understood as something like a stair. But it is not built like stairs of stones or of wooden beams placed one above another. Rather, it is just one stair, which is on an incline, ascending continually from the ground until the place up to which it leads. That is why they made a <i>kevesh</i> for the altar: it was for the purpose of ascending to it—as it says in the Mishnah “He would ascend the <i>kevesh</i>” (Zevaḥim 5:4)—and it was forbidden to make stairs for it, as the text says, “Do not ascend by stairs” (Exod 20:23).

To explain [the verse], therefore, [we must assign to it] some elided material, as follows: <i>Akhbid ‘ullekhem</i> (=I will make your yoke heavy) <i>just as my father did</i>, only I will add to what he did. Alternatively, the <i>alef</i> in <i>akhbid</i> (<b>אכביד</b>) is in place of a <i>hei</i>, and this is an infinitive—similar to <i>avrekh</i> (<b>אברך</b>; =to kneel; Gen 41:43) and <i>ashkem</i> (<b>אשכם</b>; =persisting; Jer 25:3)—so that the meaning is: My father decided <i>le-hakhbid ‘ullekhem</i> (=to make your yoke heavy), and I will add to what he did.

Verse 15

<b>For it was <i>nesibbah</i> from God.</b> In the book of Kings [it says], “For it was <i>sibbah</i> (=an orchestrated occurrence)” (1 Kgs 12:15), which is a noun. But <i>nesibbah</i> is a Niphal that does not denote an action, which is akin to an adjective: the text means to say that there was a <i>gezerah nesibbah</i> (=preordained decree) on the part of God that [Rehoboam] would listen to the advice of the young ones.

It means: [Rehoboam] married the daughter of Jerimoth son of David <i>and also married</i> Abihail daughter of Eliab. Although this Jerimoth is not listed among the sons of David (1 Chr 3:1–8), perhaps he is the same as one of those listed and had two names.

<b>He provided them with abundant food</b>—so that they should not have to ask the people.
<b>And he sought many wives.</b> This means for his sons, in order to multiply his offspring. After all, concerning himself the text [already] said that he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines (v. 21). “And he sought many wives,” therefore, means for his sons.

Verse 1

<b>In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king.</b> We do not know why his assumption of the kingship was delayed one year. After all, Rehoboam reigned for only seventeen years (2 Chr 12:13), and Rehoboam and Jeroboam began their reigns in the same year. Perhaps it can be explained that Rehoboam continued into the eighteenth year, yet it is not counted for him because he did not complete it, whereas the text suitably does count it for Jeroboam.

Verse 2

<b>His mother’s name was Micaiah daughter of Uriel.</b> She is the same as Maacah daughter of Absalom mentioned above (2 Chr 11:20), for she and her father had two names each. “Micaiah” and “Maacah” are in fact phonetically similar. Many such cases can be found in this book, where the text refers to one person by two [different] names.

Verse 17

<b>Abijah and his army inflicted a severe defeat on them.</b> According to the plain sense, this is elaborated by what follows it: <b>five hundred thousand men of Israel fell slain</b>. But there is the following midrashic interpretation (y. Yevamot 82b): “Why does the text say ‘a severe defeat’? It means: Beyond killing them, [Abijah’s army saw to it] that their wives would be unable to marry.” They say: “Rabbi Abba son of Kahana says: They mutilated their faces beyond recognition. It is in connection with this that it says, ‘The extent to which their faces are recognizable (<i>hakarat penehem</i>) accuses them’ (Isa 3:9), referring to the nose. Rabbi Ammi says: He positioned guards over them for three days until they lost their form. It is in connection with this that it says, ‘To my chagrin, their widows have outnumbered the sand of the seas’ (Jer 15:8).”

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>The Lord inflicted harm upon him and he died.</b> It is not that [Jeroboam] died in the days of Abijah. For Abijah, who became king in the eighteenth year of Jeroboam (v. 1), reigned for just three years (v. 2), at which point, in the twentieth year of Jeroboam, his son Asa became king (1 Kgs 15:9). So it emerges that when Asa became king, Jeroboam was still alive. He even lived for two years after Asa became king, for Jeroboam reigned for twenty-two years (1 Kgs 14:20). The text means, rather, that the Lord inflicted harm upon him in his battles—as it says, “God inflicted harm upon Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah” (v. 15)—“and he died,” meaning that he died in that lowly state, unable to muster any more strength from the time that Abijah reigned. But in Genesis Rabbah (65:20) and in Seder Olam (16), [the phrase] “inflicted harm upon him” is interpreted to refer to Abijah; and it is explained that this was for the sin of conquering Bethel (v. 19) without purging it of idolatrous entities—for he had found one of the calves there. There is another midrashic interpretation (y. Yevamot 82b) that is improbable: “‘The Lord inflicted harm upon him’—you think this means Jeroboam? No—it means Abijah! And why was he harmed? Because he shamed Jeroboam publicly, as it says, ‘and you possess golden calves’ (v. 8).”

Alternatively, this means: without <i>shofetei emet</i> (=truthful judges), as in: “his master shall take him before the <i>elohim</i>” (Exod 21:6), which means the judges. For in exile, the nations are Israel’s judges.

<b>And the prophecy, the prophet Oded (‘<i>Oded ha-navi</i>).</b> The noun in the construct state is elided. [The phrase] means: and the prophecy, <i>the prophecy of</i> the prophet Oded (<i>nevu’at ‘Oded ha-navi</i>). The same is true for “The Ark, [the Ark of] the Covenant” (Jos 3:14) and others like it. Alternatively it means: and the prophecy <i>of</i> the prophet Oded (<i>le-‘Oded ha-navi</i>). Now the prophecy was of Azariah son of Oded—so how could the text say “and the prophecy <i>‘Oded ha-navi</i>?” It means the son of <i>‘Oded ha-navi</i>, as in: “in the presence of my uncle Hanamel” (Jer 32:12), which means the son of my uncle—notwithstanding the alternative explanation I have provided (Jer 32:12; <i>Shorashim</i> entry <b>דוד</b>). Alternatively, [Azariah’s] father might have relayed a prophecy like this to [Asa] on another occasion—or, for that matter, on this occasion, because he was still alive, for we even encounter him in the days of Ahaz (2 Chr 28:9). So when [Asa] heard this speech from the son, and he heard the prophecy yet again from his father, the effect of it all was that <b>he motivated himself to remove the abominations</b>.

<b>Also Maacah mother of Asa.</b> She was his <i>father</i>’s mother, for Maacah daughter of Absalom was the mother of his father Abijah (2 Chr 11:20). Indeed, when the text says in the book of Kings “his mother’s name was Maacah daughter of Absalom” (cf. 1 Kgs 15:2), it means his father’s mother. It is a standard feature of the language to refer to a paternal grandfather as a father—as in “to their father Reuel” (Exod 2:18)—and to a paternal grandmother as a mother. In Asa’s case, the text mentions his father’s mother because she was an idol-worshiper—as it says “<b>because she had made an item for the idolatrous worship of an <i>asherah</i> tree</b>”—and he nonetheless did what was pleasing to the Lord and did not follow in her footsteps. It is also possible to explain that this was a different woman, Asa’s mother, who was also named “Maacah daughter of Abishalom,” just like his father’s mother.

Verse 19

<b>There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.</b> This refers to a war against Israel. The war against the Cushites (2 Chr 14:8–14), however, was in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

Chapter 16



Verse 1

<b>In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha initiated a war.</b> How could this be? After all, it says in the book of Kings, “In the twenty-sixth year … of Asa … Elah son of Baasha became king” (1 Kgs 16:8). Also, it says there that Baasha became king over Israel in the third year of Asa and reigned over Israel for twenty-four years (1 Kgs 15:33). It emerges, then, that Baasha’s reign <i>ended</i> in the <i>twenty</i>-sixth year of Asa! It is possible to explain that when the text provides these numbers in the book of Kings, it does not count from the beginning of Asa’s reign but from the beginning of his wars, and in the beginning of his reign there was peace in the land for ten years, as it says, “During his days, there was peace in the land for ten years” (2 Chr 13:23). After all, the book of Kings discusses matters pertaining to the kings of Israel also. Hence, it does not make reference to Asa’s reign from its beginning, only from the time he began to fight, leaving out the ten years during which there was peace in the land. Two of those ten years were in the days of Jeroboam; and during the remaining eight years, either Nadab had not yet taken over as king of Israel, or if he had, the text does not count them for him because his reign was not yet secured. But in the second year after that ten-year period, Nadab became king in the full sense and fought against Asa. So when it says there “In the third year of Asa,” what it means is in the third year from when he began to fight the Israelite kings. He first fought against Nadab son of Jeroboam; and three years later Baasha became king and fought against Asa, as it says, “There was a war between Asa and Baasha … all their days” (1 Kgs 15:32). And this war that Baasha initiated, during which <b>he built up the highland</b>, was in the twenty-third year of Baasha’s reign, which was the thirty-sixth year since the beginning of Asa’s reign and the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year of Asa’s wars. For the text counts the second year of Nadab son of Jeroboam for Baasha also—perhaps because [Nadab] did not make it through the whole year. But in Seder Olam (16) it says that this war was in the sixteenth year of Asa, one year after the Cushite war; and when the text refers to the thirty-sixth year, it is counting from the death of Solomon. For when Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter—in the fourth year of his reign—it was decreed that the Davidic kingship be divided for thirty-six years, equaling the thirty-six years during which Solomon was Pharaoh’s son-in-law. But the Davidic kingship was destined to return in the sixteenth year of Asa, at which point there had elapsed thirty-six years since Solomon. Yet because Asa acted wrongly in the war against Baasha, relying on the king of Aram and sending him treasures from the House of the Lord (v. 2), and not relying on the Lord (v. 7), the Davidic kingship did not return but remained divided as it was.

<b>Because [Jehoshaphat] followed in the ways of his father David—the earlier ones</b>, in which he did not sin. But later David sinned in the matter of Bathsheba (2 Sam 11) and in counting Israel (2 Sam 24). Alternatively, the text says “the earlier ones” in reference to other Judahite kings, <i>each</i> of whom sinned toward the end, and this is what it means: because he followed in the ways of his father David, which were the earlier ways of <i>each</i> of the Davidic kings. In the end they sinned, however. For Solomon’s wives led his heart astray in his old age (1 Kgs 11:3–4). Rehoboam [sinned] as well, [as the text says]: “when he grew strong, he abandoned the Teaching of the Lord” (2 Chr 12:1). So did Abijah according to the midrash that we cited (2 13:20). And Asa sinned at the end when he relied on the king of Aram (2 Chr 16:2–3) and also when he did not turn to the Lord when he was ill (ibid. v. 12).

The same is true for “<b>would bring him rams …</b>”: they would bring them to him every year.

Verse 12

<i><b>Biraniyyot</i> (=palaces).</b> This is similar to <i>birah</i> (=palace): the <i>nun</i> and the <i>yod</i> are like those in <i>raḥamaniyyot</i> (=merciful; Lam 4:10) and <i>qadmoniyyot</i> (=happenings of yore; Isa 43:18).

Chapter 20



Verse 1

<b>Together with some <i>‘Ammonim</i> (</b>עמונים<b>).</b> It says in a midrash that these are descendants of Seir, because that is how the text refers to them at the end of the story. But it calls them <i>‘Ammonim</i> because they concealed their identity, disguising themselves by wearing clothes of Ammonites so that the Israelites should not recognize them. For [the Edomite descendants of Seir] were under the rule of the Judean kings until they rebelled in the days of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat (2 Chr 21:8–10). But it is possible to explain that they were a separate nation called <i>‘Ammonim</i>—for nowhere are the Ammonites called <i>‘Ammonim</i>, only <i>benei ‘Ammon</i>. The <i>‘Ammonim</i>, then, were a different nation, who were called that because of where they were located. The same applies for “The <i>‘Ammonim</i> presented a gift to Uzziah” (2 Chr 26:8) in the account pertaining to Uzziah. It might be, however, that they are the same as the Meunites (<b>מעונים</b>) mentioned there (26:7) and that there was a transposition [of letters]. This, in fact, is the correct alternative, the name of their location having been Maon (<b>מעון</b>). We indeed find in the book of Judges: “The Sidonians, Amalek, and Maon oppressed you” (Judg 10:12).

That is, in the court, they introduced new [legislation] that did not derive from the Torah, and this is what it was.

Verse 8

<b>The Edomites rebelled against Judah’s rule and set up a king of their own.</b> For from the time of David—who subdued them and ruled over them—until this point, they remained in the same situation, under the rule of the Judean kings. They could not set up a king of their own, because they were under [the rule of] the Judean king who would appoint prefects over them.

Verse 12

<b>A letter from Elijah the prophet came to him.</b> This was after [Elijah] had ascended (2 Kgs 2:11). What happened here is that Elijah revealed himself to one of the prophets by means of prophetic inspiration. He then placed the content of this letter in the prophet’s mouth. And he instructed him to write it down in the form of a letter, bring it to Jehoram, and tell him that Elijah is sending him this letter, so that Jehoram would think it came to him from the heavens and would humble himself with the knowledge that he had done a terrible evil. How do we know that this was after [Elijah] had ascended? Because in the days of Jehoshaphat he had already ascended. After all, when Jehoshaphat allied himself with Jehoram son of Ahab to go to war against Moab, the text says, “But Jehoshaphat said, ‘Is there not a prophet here?’ … and [one of the courtiers of the king of Israel] said, ‘Elisha son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here’” (2 Kgs 3:11)—and Elisha did not separate from Elijah until his ascent. Also, it says “who poured,” and had he not ascended yet it would have said, “who <i>pours</i> water.” Indeed, it says in Seder Olam (17) that Elijah had already been concealed for seven years when the letter came to Jehoram from him.

Verse 2

<b>Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king.</b> But in the book of Kings it says, “Ahaziah was <i>twenty</i>-two years old when he became king” (2 Kgs 8:26)! Moreover, his father Jehoram’s entire lifespan was only forty years, for the text says as follows: “Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years” (1 Chr 21:5)—so how could [Ahaziah] have been forty-two years old when his father died? That would be impossible! It says in Seder Olam (17): “Once Asa married off his son Jehoshaphat to Omri’s daughter, this decree was issued—that the royal family of David be wiped out along with the house of Ahab.” And that is what happened: King Ahaziah of Judah died together with the king of Israel—for Jehu killed them—and then Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw that her son was killed and she killed off all the potential royal heirs. So that is why the text counts forty-two—from the time the decree was issued. [How so?] It was in the thirty-first year of Asa that [Jehoshaphat] married [Omri’s daughter]. For the text says, “In the thirty-first year of King Asa of Judah, Omri became king over Israel” (1 Kgs 16:23)—yet he had already reigned for four years prior (1 Kgs 16:15–16)! What it means, rather, is that he became king in the full sense: he married into the family of Asa, grew in stature, and killed Tibni and reigned over Israel (1 Kgs 16:22). And from the thirty-first year of Asa until King Ahaziah of Judah died there are in fact forty-two years. How so? Nine years of Asa; twenty-five of Jehoshaphat (1 Kgs 22:42), for a total of thirty-four; and eight years of Jehoram, for a total of forty-two. But this midrash is very far from the plain sense. It is possible to explain that Jehoram lived for more than forty years, but for purposes of [counting] the duration of his reign, the text only counts the eight years during which he ruled at full strength. It does not, however, count toward his reign the years from the time he fell in the hands of the Arabs (2 Chr 21:16–17) and also fell ill (ibid. vv. 18–19). In fact, his son Ahaziah was made king in his place while his father [Jehoram] was still alive—at the time of Jehoram’s fall, after which he continued on having lost all desire (ibid. 21:20)—and those years totaled twenty. So it was when they made Ahaziah king during his father’s lifetime that he was twenty-two—that is the meaning of the assertion in Kings, “Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king”—and it was when his father died that he was forty-two. And he only reigned for <b>one year</b> after his father’s death.
<b>His mother’s name was Athaliah daughter of Omri.</b> She was Ahab’s daughter, as the text says above (2 21:6); but it relates her to her father’s father. The same is true for: “They then returned to their father Reuel” (Exod 2:18)—for Reuel was their father’s father.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>And <i>ha-Rammim</i> wounded.</b> This elides an <i>alef</i>: it is equivalent to “<i>ha-Arammim</i> (=the Arameans). The same is true for <i>mi-bet ha-surim</i> (=from prison; Eccl 4:14).

Verse 6

<b>Because <i>ha-makkim</i>.</b> This is a noun, akin to <i>ha-makkot</i> (=the wounds). [The phrase] means: because he had to recover from the wounds.
<b>And King Azariah son of Jehoram of Judah.</b> He is the same as King Ahaziah of Judah: he had two names.

Verse 7

<b>The <i>tevusah</i> of Ahaziah.</b> This is akin to <i>mehumah</i> (=degradation), as in “a day of <i>mehumah</i> and <i>mevusah</i>” (Isa 22:5). [The verse] means: God prompted Ahaziah’s degrading visit to Jehoram, so that he would die with him.

Verse 8

<b>And the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers, acting in the service of Ahaziah.</b> This refers to what is described in Kings: “Jehu came upon the brothers of Ahaziah”—meaning the sons of his brothers—“and said ‘Who are you?’ [And they replied: ‘We are the brothers of Ahaziah], and have come to ensure the safety of the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother’” (2 Kgs 10:13). For here as well, when it says “acting in the service of Ahaziah,” it means that they were going on behalf of Ahaziah to help the sons of the king of Israel.

Verse 9

<b>[Ahaziah] had been hiding in Samaria.</b> But in Kings it says, “and he fled along the road to Beth-haggan, and Jehu pursued him and said, ‘Kill him too!’ …” (2 Kgs 9:27), from which it seems that they killed him on the road, when he was fleeing! It might be that they pursued him but did not catch up to him. After all, the text does not say “<i>they killed</i> him on the chariot,” but rather “<i>kill</i> him.” So they did not actually catch up to him but rather shot arrows at him, whereas he managed to flee, as it says, “He fled to Megiddo” (ibid.). Perhaps he then left Megiddo; and when the text says “and he died there” (ibid.), it does not mean that he really died. Rather, the arrows struck him on the road while he was fleeing, and he fled to Megiddo and “died” there in the sense of having been knocked out because of his wounds—just as the text says “and he died” concerning Nabal (1 Sam 25:37) even though he did not die until ten days later (ibid. v. 38). Then afterward, [Ahaziah’s] servants carried him to hide in Samaria, which he did. But Jehu’s servants found him there <b>and brought him to Jehu and killed him</b>—for he had not yet died. When the text then says here, “<b>And they buried him, for it was said, ‘He is a son of Jehoshaphat</b>,<b>’</b>” it means that they designated him for burial, allowing his servants to carry him to Jerusalem, as it says in Kings, “His servants conveyed him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his grave with his fathers, in the city of David” (2 Kgs 9:28).
<b>The house of Ahaziah could not then muster the strength to rule.</b> From the time he died, there was nobody left in the house of Ahaziah who could muster the strength to rule, because he did not have a son old enough to rule. Indeed, all the potential royal heirs were minors. That is why Athaliah had the ability to kill off all the potential royal heirs of the house of David (v. 10)

Verse 10

<i><b>Vattedabber</i>.</b> [This means]: and she killed, akin to: “a very severe <i>dever</i> (=pestilence)” (Exod 9:3). In the parallel verse in Kings it in fact says, “and she killed off” (2 Kgs 11:1).

Verse 11

<b>In the bedroom.</b> [This is to be understood] as Targum Jonathan renders it in Kings (ibid. v. 2): “in the sleeping quarters”; that is, in the room in which Jehoiada and his wife Jehoshabeath slept.

Verse 6

<i><b>Ha-mesharetim la-Leviyyim</i> (=the ministering Levites). </b>The <i>lamed</i> is in place of a definite <i>hei</i>. The same is true for: “on whose arm <i>la-melekh</i> (=the king) was leaning” (2 Kgs 7:2)—it is akin to <i>ha-melekh</i>.
<b>Shall carry out the guard duty.</b> This means that the priests and the Levites shall guard the inside of the Temple—[that is], the porch and the Great Hall—“because they are sanctified,” and [non-Levite] Israelites may not enter them. But the <i>whole</i> nation shall carry out the guard duty of<b> the Lord</b> outside.

Verse 8

<b>For Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the divisions.</b> This refers to the divisions that were assigned weekly shifts since the time of David (1 Chr 23:6–27:34): Jehoiada withheld all members of the outgoing shift instead of dismissing them. [That is], he withheld them all—“the ones whose week was beginning along with the ones whose week had ended”—to guard the king.

<b>And the <i>‘edut</i>.</b> [This means] the royal garments, akin to <i>ve-‘adita ‘edi</i> (=and donned your finery; Ezek 23:40). <i>‘Edut</i> is in the pattern of <i>ge’ut</i> (=exalted acts; Isa 12:5).

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Was standing on his stand.</b> [The formulation] in Kings—“on the stand” (2 Kgs 11:14)—is rendered by Targum Jonathan “on <i>iṣtevana</i>”; that is, the <i>setav</i> (=bench) on which the king stands in the House of the Lord.

Verse 14

<b>Take [Athaliah] out to the chamber of the <i>sederot</i>.</b> [This is] a place that was <i>nisdar</i> (=set up) for officers to sit.
<b>And anyone who follows her—</b>to help her.

Verse 15

<b>They made for her <i>yadayim</i> (=hands).</b> This means: They cleared an area for her to flee and to proceed <b>into the entrance of the Horse Gate</b>.

Verse 6

<i><b>Mas’at</i> (משאת) Moses, the servant of the Lord.</b> This refers to the money from the shekels—the half-shekels that all the Israelites would give once a year, as it says in the Torah, “When <i>tissa</i> (תשא; =you take a census of) the Israelite people” (Exod 30:12). That it why the text calls it a <i>mas’et</i>—akin to: “When <i>tissa</i>.” In Kings, the text makes reference to three kinds of <i>kesef</i> (=[donations of] money; 2 Kgs 12:5): <i>kesef ‘over</i>, as it says, “Everyone who is <i>‘over ‘al ha-pequdim</i> (=entered into the records)” (Exod 30:13); “<i>kesef</i> a man pays as the value of persons,” which refers to someone who says “I pledge my value” or “I pledge so-and-so’s value”; and “any <i>kesef</i> that a man should decide,” which refers to one who donates for the upkeep of the Temple.
<b>And the congregation, to Israel.</b> [The latter part of the verse] means: the money of Moses, the servant of the Lord, and of the congregation, which Moses commanded to Israel to bring <b>to the Tent of Testimony</b> in the wilderness (Exod 30:16).

Verse 7

<b>For Athaliah <i>ha-mirsha‘at</i> (=the wicked).</b> <i>Ha-mirsha‘at</i>—the <i>mem</i> with a <i>ḥireq</i>—is an adjective, similar to <i>he-‘arim ha-mivdalot</i> (=the marked-off cities; Jos 16:9).
<b>Her sons had violated the House of God.</b> This means: She and her sons had violated the house of God, and that is why it needed reinforcement and repair. “Her sons” refers to sons she had by another man, and not by the king.
<b>And had also used <i>kol</i> the sacred things of the House of the Lord for the Baals.</b> For had [Athaliah’s sons] not removed the sacred things from the House of the Lord for the Baals, they would have sufficed to repair the Temple. But because they did use them for the Baals, it was necessary to collect money from all Israel. Athaliah and her sons did not remove all the sacred things of the House of the Lord, only most of them. That is why the text says <i>kol</i>, which is to be understood as “most of,” as in “<i>kol</i> the bounty of his master” (Gen 24:10). The proof that some of the sacred things of the House of the Lord remained is that in the book of Kings, when Hazael initiates a battle on Jerusalem, it says, “King Joash of Judah took all the objects that had been consecrated by Jehoshaphat, Jehoram …” (2 Kgs 12:19). But Joash did not want to spend that remnant for the work, so that the treasury of the Lord would not be left empty. Had Athaliah and her sons not violated the Temple, it would still have been standing, because from the time the Temple was built until Joash repaired it, only one hundred and fifty-five years had passed, and a strong building like that would have stood far longer had they not violated it.

Verse 8

<i><b>Aron eḥad</i>. </b>[This means]: <i>aron ish eḥad</i> (=someone’s box). <i>Vayya‘asu</i> means that they fixed it up so that the money could be placed in it, as it says in Kings, “and bored a hole in its lid” (2 Kgs 12:10).

Verse 11

<i><b>Vi‘aru</i> (=and they would empty) the box.</b> This is akin to “<i>vatte‘ar</i> (=and she emptied) her jar” (Gen 24:20).

Verse 13

<b>And the work found good health (<i>‘arukhah</i>).</b> This is metaphorical. The same is true for: “that healing (<i>‘arukhah</i>) had come to the walls of Jerusalem” (Neh 4:1), and for: “and he healed (<i>vayrappei</i>) the damaged altar of the Lord” (1 Kgs 18:30).

Verse 14

<b>[The remaining silver] was made into utensils for the House of the Lord—service vessels.</b> But in Kings it says, “However, no silver vessels were made at the House of the Lord …” (2 Kgs 12:14)! Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Ketubot 106b), note the discrepancy between these verses, and they explain that one refers to a situaion where the amount that they raised yielded a surplus, and the other to situation where it did not. That is the point when the text says, “When they had finished, they brought to the king and Jehoiada….” For prior to the completion of the work they did not make vessels, as it says in Kings, “because they gave it to the workers” (2 Kgs 12:15). But once the work was done—as it says here, “and they restored the House of God to its original form and reinforced it, and <i>when they had finished</i> …” (vv. 13–14)—they made what was left into service vessels.
<b>And <i>ha-‘alot</i> and spoons.</b> Some explain that this is akin to <i>‘eli</i>, which is a pestle—as in: “together with the grain, with the <i>‘eli</i>” (Prov 27:22)—and that they were made to grind the spices for the incense. But in my opinion this is a small utensil used to draw water from the <i>hin</i>, for libations. We find [a reference to] it in a rabbinic source (b. Eruvin 53b): “When speaking cleverly, the maidservants in the house of Rabbi would say to him: ‘The <i>‘alat</i> is banging on the jar.’” That is, the small vessel with which they would draw wine from the jar was called an <i>‘alat</i>, and they would tell him that the <i>‘alat</i> was hitting the bottom of the vessel, meaning that there was no wine in the jar. They also say (b. Sabbath 119a): “He found a jewel in it, and he sold it for thirteen <i>‘alita</i> of <i>dinar</i>s.” That is, he sold it for thirteen vessels—of this small type called an <i>‘alat—</i>filled with <i>dinar</i>s. In the singular it is called an <i>‘alat</i> or an <i>‘alah</i>, and in the plural <i>‘alot</i>.

Verse 17

<b>And [the officers of Judah] bowed to the king, at which point the king listened to them.</b> They bowed to him and persuaded him with their words, saying, among other things, that they would obey any command of his, and that he too should listen to them and worship <i>asherah</i> trees like all the nations. So at that point the king listened to them, and they left the service of the Temple and worshiped idols. But in a midrashic source [it says] (cf. Tanḥuma [Buber] <i>Va’era</i> 16): “‘And they bowed’ to him—that is, they made him into a god. They said to him: It says, ‘any outsider who encroaches shall be put to death’ (Num 18:7), and you were in the Temple for six years (2 Chr 22:12) and are still alive! Because a wondrous thing has been witnessed concerning you, you are worthy of our worshiping you as a god.”

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>Because of the murder of the sons of Jehoiada the priest.</b> Perhaps when [the people] killed Zechariah (vv. 21–22) they also killed the rest of Jehoiada’s sons. Alternatively, Jehoiada had no sons then except for Zechariah, because the rest of his sons—to whom the text alludes when it says “and he fathered sons and daughters” (v. 3)—had already died. So the only one of Jehoiada’s sons left was Zechariah—whom they killed—and it says “because of the murder of the <i>sons</i> of Jehoiada” in the same sense as “The <i>sons</i> of Dan: Hushim” (Gen 46:23).

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b>And his sons <i>yirev</i> (ירב) <i>ha-massa</i> concerning him.</b> The spelling is ורב (<i>ve-rov</i>; =and the large amount of)—which is a noun, as in <i>ve-rov banav</i> (=and his large number of sons; Esth 5:11)—meaning <i>rov ha-massa</i> (=the large amount of prophecy) that the prophets prophesied concerning him, as it says, “He sent prophets among them” (v. 19). But it is read <i>yirev</i>, a variation of <i>yirbeh</i> (=will abound): it is a future-tense form appearing in place of a past-tense form. What it means is: “the prophecies that abounded concerning him.” “<i>His</i> sons” refers to Joash. [The verse] means: A record of his sons and of how <i>massa</i>—that is, prophecy—abounded concerning him, and an account of his repair of the <b>foundation of the House of God</b>, are all written down <b>in the <i>midrash</i> of the kings</b>. We have already explained why it is called a <i>midrash</i> (2 Chr 13:22).

Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>But [Jotham] did not enter the Temple of the Lord.</b> That is, concerning this matter, he did not follow his father Uzziah, who went into the Temple of the Lord to offer incense (2 Chr 26:16). Alternatively, “But he did not enter the Temple of the Lord” means: Because his father Uzziah faltered there, he did not want to go inside to pray or to bring his offerings; so he offered them on shrines. For that is the meaning of “<b>the people still acted corruptly</b>,” as is made explicit in the book of Kings: “the people continued to sacrifice and make offerings at the shrines” (2 Kgs 15:35).

Verse 19

<b>For <i>hifria‘</i>  in Judah.</b> This is akin to: “for Aaron <i>pera‘oh</i> (=exposed them)” (Exod 32:25)—the sense is one of revealing. It means: [Ahaz] revealed [things] in Judah; that is, through him, their evil deeds became publicly revealed.

Verse 20

<b>And [Tillegath-pilneser] caused [Ahaz] trouble, <i>ve-lo ḥazaqo</i>.</b> Some explain this in a transitive sense, as in: “to apply a bandage in order to wrap it <i>u-le-ḥozqo</i> (=and to strengthen it)” (Ezek 30:21). If [<i>ḥazaqo</i>] is in fact transitive, we may explain [the verse] as follows: <i>Ve-lo ḥazaqo melekh Ashur</i> (=And the Assyrian king did not support him). And because Ahaz had sent to him for help, the text says that he not only did not support him but marched against him and caused him trouble. Indeed, it says, “but it was of no help” (v. 21). That is, even though [Ahaz] bribed him (2 Kgs 16:8), whereas this worked to take care of Rezin and Pekah whom he had feared, [the Assyrian king] marched against him also and caused him trouble. If [<i>ḥazaqo</i>] is intransitive, however, [the verse] means: <i>ve-lo ḥazaq mimmennu</i> (=and he did not gain strength from him). That is, Ahaz gained no strength from the Assyrian king. Rather, after destroying Damascus and Samaria, [the Assyrian king] caused him trouble also.

<i><b>Hekhannu</i> (=we have made ready/have designated) <i>ve-hiqdashnu</i> (=and we have consecrated); they are standing in front of the altar of the Lord.</b> The plain sense is as follows: “We have made them ready” in the sense of having purified them, and we “have consecrated” them for the Lord as in the beginning. However, our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Avodah Zarah 52b), explain <i>hekhannu</i> to mean “we have hid them away”—for they were no longer worthy to be used in the service of the Lord—and <i>hiqdashnu</i> to mean “we have consecrated others in their place.”

<b>The song <i>meshorer</i> and the trumpets <i>maḥṣe rim</i> (מחצצרים; =were playing).</b> The second <i>ṣadei</i> in מחצצרים<i></i> is not pronounced. [When the text says] “the song,” it means that the <i>one designated for</i> song <i>meshorer</i> (=was singing). Alternatively, the word <i>meshorer</i> refers to the song, and it is an intransitive verb: it is as though the text had said <i>mishtorer</i> (=was being sung). The same applies for: “and the trumpets <i>maḥṣerim</i>.”

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b>And all those charitably inclined—burnt offerings.</b> Because burnt offerings are not like [peace] offerings and offerings of thanksgiving, for [the latter two] are eaten by their owner whereas burnt offerings are burnt in their entirety, the text says concerning the bringing of burnt offerings, “all those charitably inclined.”

Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b>[The priests’] kinsmen, the Levites, motivated them.</b> They helped [the priests] with the flaying, and in this way they motivated them, prompting them to hurry and sanctify themselves. For even though the priests are commanded to do everything from the catching of the blood onward (b. Berakhot 31b), this was an emergency. The Levites helped the priests with the flaying because they <i>had</i> sanctified themselves, as the text says, “<b>The Levites were more conscientious about sanctifying themselves than the priests</b>.”

Verse 35



Verse 36

<b>Over <i>ha-hekhin ha-Elohim la-‘am</i>.</b> This is akin to: <i>asher hekhin</i> (=<i>that which</i> [God] enabled [the nation] to accomplish).

Chapter 30



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>The king came to an agreement.</b> <i>After</i> he came to an agreement he sent word to all Israel and Judah. For when the text says “Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah … to observe Passover” (v. 1), this was <i>because</i> he had come to an agreement with the officers and the congregation to observe Passover in the second month. I wonder about what our Sages say (b. Berakhot 10b) that [Hezekiah] added another Nisan during Nisan [itself], and that [the rabbinic authorities] did not accede to this. For the text says, “The king came to an agreement <b>with his officers and the entire congregation in Jerusalem</b>”—so it says that they did accede to it! They also have no proof from the verse that he added another Nisan during Nisan. For this agreement could have taken place in Adar—to make a second Adar in place of Nisan and to observe Passover in the second month; that is, Iyyar: it could have been turned into Nisan so that they might observe Passover in it. Moreover, as for the assertions they make (b. Sanhedrin 12a-b) in debating why Hezekiah sought mercy (v. 18), it is explicit, after all, that this was because many of the people had eaten the paschal sacrifice in an unclean state, as the text says, “yet they ate the paschal sacrifice in violation of what was written” (ibid.)!
<b>To observe Passover in the second month.</b> This was not akin to a “second Passover,” because they did not observe Passover in the month of Nisan at all. Instead, they changed Nisan into Adar: they made it a leap year because of the uncleanness and because of the people who would not have been able to reach Jerusalem. For their hearts had not yet acquiesced to serve God, and they had not wanted to come to Jerusalem to make the paschal sacrifice, as the text says, “because <i>la-rov</i> they did not do as was written” (v. 5). That is, to this point, <i>rov</i> (=most) of Israel had not done as was written, because they had been worshiping idols and did not care to come to Jerusalem for the service of God—hence the need to make it a leap year and extend the time. For even though Hezekiah had sent couriers (v. 6), most people mocked them (v. 10). And even those who came did not all sanctify themselves but rather ate the paschal sacrifice in an unclean state (vv. 17–18), so that Hezekiah had to seek mercy on their behalf, as the text says (v. 18). Thus, they were compelled to make it a leap year: they assigned the second month the status of Nisan, made the paschal sacrifice in it, and made the seven-day Feast of Unleavened Bread.

Verse 3

<b>For the priests had not sanctified themselves <i>le-ma-day</i> (=in great enough numbers).</b> This is equivalent to <i>le-min day</i>, albeit with a <i>pataḥ</i> under the <i>mem</i> as in <i>le-ma-ba-rishonah</i> (=the first time; 1 Chr 15:13). [The phrase] means: for not enough priests had sanctified themselves for there to be enough (<i>day</i>) of them to bring the offerings.

<b>The priests dashed the blood [that they received] from the Levites—</b>for the priests are commanded to do everything from the receiving of the blood onward (b. Ber. 31b).

Verse 17

<b>Because <i>rabbat</i> (=many) in the congregation.</b> This is a noun, as in “<i>rabbat</i> (=many) have assailed me” (Ps 129:1). The point is that there were many in the congregation who <b>had not sanctified themselves</b>.
<b>For anyone not clean.</b> This means: The Levites were prepared to slaughter the paschal sacrifice for the sake of any Israelite who was not clean. For even though many of them <i>ate</i> the sacrifice in an unclean state, they had no other choice: they were compelled to do so because they had had no opportunity to become clean. But they received no dispensation to enter the court unclean, because the Levites were able to act on their behalf.

Verse 18

<b>Yet they ate the paschal sacrifice in violation of what was written.</b> This means: not in accordance with its regulations. For an unclean person who eats of sacred things is cut off, consistent with the verse: “any man among your offspring who approaches [any sacred donation] that [the Israelite people] may consecrate … [that person] shall be cut off” (Lev 22:3); and our Sages, of blessed memory (cf. b. Zevaḥim 45b) explain “approaching” to mean eating. For one does not incur the punishment of being cut off by touching alone. Rather, [the phrase] means: [any man] who approaches and eats. And the paschal sacrifice is indeed a sacred thing (of lesser stringency).
<b>The good Lord will provide atonement for.</b> This is connected to the beginning of the next verse—<i>kol levavo hekhin</i> (=anyone who sets his mind). But the scholar Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (Ps 73:15) explains that it is not connected: <i>kol levavo</i> (=his entire heart) refers to Hezekiah, and “will provide atonement for” means that He will provide atonement for those who ate the paschal sacrifice in an unclean state.

Verse 19

<b>And in violation of the standard of cleanness associated with sacred things.</b> This means: Even though they ate in violation of the standard of cleanness associated with sacred things, Hezekiah prayed on their behalf that God should provide atonement for them, on the grounds that they had set their minds on worshiping God.

Verse 20

<b>And [God] healed the people.</b> That is, He forgave their transgression. “Heal me for I have sinned against you” (Ps 41:5) also bears the sense of forgiveness.

Verse 21

<b>With instruments of <i>‘oz</i> (=vitality) for the Lord</b>—in the sense of “dancing with full <i>‘oz</i> (=vitality)” (2 Sam 6:14).

Verse 5

<i><b>Ve-ki-peroṣ ha-davar</i> (=when the matter spread).</b> [This means]: when [the Israelites] started bringing the gifts and the tithes. In a midrashic vein, our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Nedarim 55a), explain that the reason the text says <i>ve-ki-peroṣ</i> is that they went above and beyond (<i>pareṣu</i>) when it came to bringing the tithes: they brought even of the produce of trees and of greens, which are not included in the biblical mandate.
<b>The first of the grains.</b> [This refers either to] “first-fruits” or [to] the standard priestly share (<i>terumah gedolah</i>), which is “first” (Deut 18:4). 
<b>Honey</b> refers to dates, because one does not bring first fruits or [set aside] a priests’ share from [bee] honey. Indeed, our Sages, of blessed memory (Sifrei Deut 297), explain “a land of olive oil <i>and honey</i>” (Deut 8:8) to refer to dates, because it is from the very seven products mentioned in [that] verse that one brings first fruits (m. Bikkurim 1:3).
<b>And all kinds of agricultural produce.</b> [This means]: fruit of the rest of the trees from which first fruits are brought—the grape, fig, and pomegranate.

Verse 6

<b>And tithes of sacred things consecrated to the Lord.</b> They brought tithes even from the sacred things they had consecrated, even though these are exempt from tithes.

Verse 7

<b>The heaps began to accumulate (<i>lissod</i> [ליסּוד]).</b> The <i>yesod</i> (<b>יסוד</b>; =foundation) of the heaps means their beginning. <i>Lissod</i> is an infinitive form. The gemination strengthens the pronunciation of the <i>samekh</i> for euphonic purposes and does not reflect the assimilation of a letter—for the <i>yod</i> of the root is written.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<i><b>Lavi</i> (=to be brought) to the House of the Lord.</b> This is the equivalent of <i>lehavi</i>.
<b>Eating to satiety.</b> That is, let the priests and Levites eat of the gifts and the tithes to satiety.
<b>And whatever is left over <i>et</i> this large group.</b> This means: And let whatever is left over be <i>for</i> this large group; that is, let them keep it and distribute it among themselves, old and young alike on a daily basis (v. 15–16). The text calls this a “large group” because the priests and Levites gathered together there from all over.

Verse 16

<b>Besides [what was allocated to] male family members, from three years old and up.</b> For males under three were not eligible to come to the House of the Lord, and the females did not come in any case. Alternatively, the text says “from three” because [a child] under three does not know how to watch what is in his hand. One does not, then, give the priests’ share to him, lest he make it unclean, because he tends to dabble everywhere—among dead reptiles or anything else. But from three years old and up he knows how to watch his hands, because he has been taught and trained. “Family members” indicates that fathers would come together with their sons. And “besides” alludes to the allocations that the text says would be made to them in the priestly cities (v. 15) <i>besides</i> what would be allocated to them when they would come to <b>the House of the Lord</b>.

Verse 17

<b>And the Levites from twenty years old and up.</b> But in the Torah it says, “From twenty-<i>five</i> years old and up they shall participate in the work force in the service of the Tent of Meeting” (Num 8:24)! [Hezekiah] called on them before they came of age so that they would become adept and well-trained in the service of the Lord, because everything had been forgotten when the service of the House of the Lord was discontinued during the days of the wicked kings.

Verse 19

<b>To every male priest.</b> [This means] portions <i>fit to be eaten</i> by male priests.
<b>And to every Levite family member.</b> [This means] to their wives and children.

Chapter 32



Verse 1

<b>After these faithful deeds.</b> After Hezekiah and the Judeans performed all these faithful deeds and returned to the worship of the true God, <b>Sennacherib invaded</b> them. For even though Hezekiah’s heart was sincere, there were improper things going on in Judah, where not everyone was wholeheartedly committed to the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah indicates in his many admonitions to them.
<b>And resolved to take them over.</b> And so [Sennacherib] did, as it says in Kings: “and he seized them” (2 Kgs 18:13). Similar cases include: “to lie with Jacob’s daughter” (Gen 34:7), “to kill him treacherously” (Exod 21:14), and those like them.

<b>Thereafter, <i>vayyinnassei</i> (=he boasted) before all the nations.</b> This would normally be <i>vayyitnassei</i>. It is similar in meaning to <i>mitnassei lemor</i> (=went about boasting; 1 Kgs 1:5): [Hezekiah] boasted over all the greatness and honor he had attained. It is with reference to this that the text says, “for he grew arrogant” (v. 25).

<b>And <i>uravot</i> (</b><i>ארות</i><b>).</b> [This means] troughs: the Targum renders “the trough of its master” (Isa 1:3) <i>orya</i> (<i><b>אוריא</b></i>) <i>de-marohi</i>. 
The same is true for: “<b>and <i>‘adarim</i> for the <i>averot</i> (</b><i>אורות</i><b>)</b>”—this is a metathesized form of <i><b>ארות</b></i>. The meaning of <i>‘adarim</i> is <i>ma‘arakhot</i> (=orderly storage places); compare “<i>‘oderei marakhah</i> (=men who manned the battle lines) with whole heart” (1 Chr 12:39).

Verse 29



Verse 30

<b>The upper one.</b> It seems that Wadi Gihon had two courses, and that it was the top one that [Hezekiah] stopped up. I am surprised that our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Berakhot 10b), say that when he stopped up the flow of Gihon, the [religious authorities] did not accede to this. For the text says above, “he consulted with his officers (<i>sarav</i>) and warriors about stopping up the flow of the springs” (v. 3), and <i>sarav</i> include the scholars of Israel; for it says “<i>sarei</i> (=chiefs of) thousands” when referring to the scholars of the judiciary (Exod 18:21–22)! In fact, I found in an aggadic source (Avot de-Rabbi Natan [Schechter] A:2) that when he stopped up the flow of Gihon, his will corresponded to that of God.
<b>And he directed it (<i>vayyasherem</i> [וַיַּישְּׁרֵם]) underneath, toward the west (<i>ma‘ravah</i>).</b> In principle this should have been וַיְיַשְּׁרֵם, but when the <i>yod</i> that constitutes the first root-letter quiesced, its vowel shifted to the preformative <i>yod</i>. <i>Ma‘ravah</i> is stressed on the penultimate syllable and has an added [directional] <i>hei</i>. So this means: He directed it underground through openings and led it westward <b>toward the City of David</b>.

Verse 31

<b>In the matter of <i>meliṣei sarei</i> (=the officers and chiefs of) Babylon.</b> These are two consecutive [synonymous] nouns in the construct state. The same is true for: “<i>naharei naḥalei</i> (=rivers and brooks of) honey and cream” (Job 20:17), and for: “<i>mivḥar ve-tov</i> (=the choicest and best) of Lebanon” (Ezek 31:16). <i>Meliṣei</i> is in the sense of <i>meliṣah</i>.
<b>To know <i>kol bi-levavo</i>.</b> [This means]: <i>kol asher bi-levavo</i> (=all <i>that</i> was in his heart). [Hezekiah] was thrilled when [the Babylonian officers] came, and he showed them his entire treasurehouse (2 Kgs 20:13). All this was for his own honor: he boasted in this respect, and God considered that he had sinned. “To know” means: so that <i>people</i> should know.

Verse 32



Verse 33

<b>In the <i>ma‘aleh</i> of the tombs of the descendants of David.</b> [This means]: in the <i>maqom ha-me‘uleh</i> (=choicest place) among them; that is, with the best of them. Similarly, our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Bava Kamma 16b), say: “With the choicest members of the family. Who are they? David and Solomon.”

<i><b>Ma‘ravah le-Giḥon</i> (=west of Gihon).</b> [<i>Ma‘ravah</i>] is stressed on the final syllable: it is akin to <i>ma‘arav</i>, with the <i>hei</i> ending that marks a feminine noun. The same is true for <i>mi-mizraḥ ha-shemesh u-mi-ma‘aravah</i> (=in the east, where the sun rises, and in the west; Isa 45:6). Alternatively, it might be that in both cases, the <i>hei</i> is a feminine pronoun and should really have featured a <i>mappiq</i>. We have previously listed similar cases, in the <i>Mikhlol</i> (26b-27a). The meaning of <i>ma‘ravah le-Giḥon</i>, then, would be that the west side <i>of the wall</i> was <i>toward</i> Gihon, <b>in the wadi</b>. Likewise, [<i>mi-mizraḥ ha-shemesh</i>] <i>u-mi-ma‘aravah</i> would mean [from the place of the rising of the sun] to that of <i>its</i> setting—for <i>shemesh</i> (=sun) can be either masculine or feminine.
<b>And it encircled the <i>‘ofel</i>—</b>a high place that was within the wall.

Verse 20

<b>And [Manasseh] was buried <i>beto</i>.</b> This is the equivalent of <i>be-beto</i> (=<i>in</i> his <i>bayit</i>). The same is true for <i>ha-nimṣa bet Adonay</i> (=found <i>in</i> the House of the Lord; 2 Kgs 12:11). <i>Beto</i> means in the garden that he had in the <i>bayit</i> (=house), much as it says in Kings, “in the garden of his <i>bayit</i>” (2 Kgs 21:18). <i>Bayit</i> is an inclusive term for the houses and the garden.

<b>In the twelfth year he began to purge.</b> But he did not finish until the eighteenth year of his reign, after finding the scroll (vv. 8, 14): it was then that he finished purging everything (v. 33).

Verse 4

<b>Onto the graves, <i>ha-zoveḥim la-hem</i> (=those who sacrificed to them).</b> The noun in the construct state is elided: the graves, <i>qivrei ha-zoveḥim la-hem</i> (=<i>the graves of</i> those who sacrificed to them). This is akin to <i>ha-aron ha-berit</i> (=the Ark, [the Ark of] the Covenant; Jos 3:14), <i>ha-‘am ha-milḥamah</i> (=the people, [the people of] the battle; Jos 8:11), and those like them.

Verse 6

Verse 7

<b>He ground <i>le-hedaq</i> (=into fine bits).</b> This is the equivalent of <i>le-hadeq</i>, or it is a form of the Niphal.

Verse 8

<b>In the eighteenth year of his reign, to purge the land and the Temple.</b> This means: <i>He decided</i> to complete the purging of the land and the Temple, and he in turn <b>commissioned Shaphan son of Azaliah to repair</b> the Temple.

<b>In his place.</b> In the book of Kings, however, [it says], “on the <i>‘ammud</i>” (2 Kgs 23:3). What is meant, then, is that [Josiah] stood on his feet, <i>near</i> the <i>‘ammud</i> (=pillar). But Targum Jonathan renders “the <i>‘ammud</i>”: <i>istevana</i> (=the stand). We have already explained this above (2 Chr 23:13).

<b>Put the Holy Ark.</b> Perhaps Manasseh removed it from there when he placed the idol in the House of God (2 Chr 33:7). But there is a problem: How could he have failed to return it there after he had humbled himself and removed the image from the House of the Lord (ibid. vv. 12, 15)? Our Sages, of blessed memory (cf. b. Yoma 52b, Horayot 12a), explain that [Josiah] ordered that the Ark be hid away so that it not be taken away with the exile. They say that there was a stone in the Holy of Holies, at its west side: the Ark was placed on top of it, and the container of manna and the staff of Aaron in front of it. For when Solomon built the Temple knowing that it would eventually be destroyed, he built an area underneath in which to hide away the Ark—in deep and windy hidden compartments; and this stone was the cover for that place. So on King Josiah’s order, the Ark was hidden away in that area <b>that Solomon</b> had<b> built</b>—as it says, “Put the Holy Ark …”—and the staff of Aaron, the container of manna, and the anointing oil were hidden away with it.

Verse 18

<b>Since the time of the prophet Samuel, no Passover like that one had ever been kept in Israel.</b> In Kings it says, “since the days of the chieftains” (2 Kgs 23:22), because Samuel was a chieftain (1 Sam 7:15). When the text says that no Passover like that had ever been kept, it means in which all Israel were of one mind to worship the Lord. Indeed, it says in Samuel, “and all the house of Israel came together to devote themselves to the Lord” (1 Sam 7:2), and, “And the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and they served the Lord alone” (ibid. 7:4). For even in the context of the Passover that Hezekiah made, there were many Israelites who were not there. Not only that, but they mocked the couriers whom Hezekiah had sent (2 Chr 30:10). And even many of those who were in Jerusalem were unclean, and they ate the paschal sacrifice in their unclean state (ibid. 30:17–18).

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Neco (<i>Nekhoh</i>) came up.</b> “Neco” is a nickname, as it says in Kings, “Pharaoh Neco” (2 Kgs 23:29). He was called that because he was <i>nekheh raglayim</i> (=crippled in his feet). That is how Targum Jonathan (ibid.) renders it: “Pharaoh the lame.”

Verse 21

<b>And <i>Elohim</i> (=God) said that I should hurry; refrain, then, from interfering with <i>Elohim</i> who is with me.</b> In the rabbinic literature there is a debate: some say (Tractate Soferim 4:9) that both [references to the Divine] are to the Holy One—and it indeed appears so when the text says, “and he did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of <i>Elohim</i>” (v. 22).

Verse 22

<b>For [Josiah] had changed in order to fight [Neco].</b> He had changed his clothes, dressing in clothes of war in order to fight him.
<b>To the words of Neco from the mouth of God.</b> Perhaps the prophet Jeremiah had indicated that Neco was to fight in Carchemish. And while he was still there, fighting in Carchemish on the Euphrates (v. 20), God, may He be blessed, exacted King Josiah’s revenge when Nebuchadnezzar attacked [Neco]. That is the point when Jeremiah prophesies, “Concerning Egypt, about the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was at the Euphrates River near Carchemish, and which was defeated by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon …” (Jer 46:2), followed by, “That day shall be for the Lord … of Hosts a day when He exacts revenge on His enemies” (ibid. v. 10). This refers to the revenge of King Josiah.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>And [Jeremiah] made them an institution for Israel.</b> This refers to the book of Lamentations in which there appears a eulogy for Josiah; namely, “The breath of our life, the Lord’s anointed, was captured in their traps” (Lam 4:20).

Chapter 36



Verse 1

Verse 3

<b>The king of Egypt deposed [Jehoahaz] in Jerusalem.</b> This means <i>from reigning</i> in Jerusalem. Indeed, in Kings it says “from reigning in Jerusalem” (2 Kgs 23:33). But it was “in Riblah in the region of Hamath” where he imprisoned him (ibid.) and deposed him from the kingship.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>In order to bring [Jehoiakim] to Babylon.</b> But [Nebuchadnezzar] did not in fact bring him there, for Jehoiakim died on the way: it is about him that the text says, “He shall have the burial of an ass, dragged out and cast aside …” (Jer 22:19). However, the text says in Daniel: “The Lord delivered King Jehoiakim of Judah into his hands, together with some of the vessels of the House of God, and he brought them to the land of Shinar” (Dan 1:2)! If this is the case, then [Nebuchadnezzar] <i>did</i> bring him to Babylon, together with the vessels. Afterward, however, he brought him back to Jerusalem—Jehoiakim did, after all, reign for eleven years (v. 5)—and toward the end of his life, Jehoiakim started up again and rebelled. The troops then captured him there (2 Kgs 24:1–2) and he died on the way, while in their hands, as the text says, “dragged out and cast aside.” “In order to bring him,” then, means that they actually brought him, just as “to kill him treacherously” (Exod 21:14) means that he actually killed him.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>In the books of the kings of Israel and Judah.</b> This is the book of Jeremiah: it is there that [Jehoiakim’s] abominable deeds are recorded, in the passage [that begins], “Whoa to him who builds his house” (Jer 22:13). For in the book of Kings none of his abominable deeds are recorded, only the general [statement], “He did what was displeasing to the Lord” (2 Kgs 23:37).

Verse 9

<b>Jehoiachin was eight years old.</b> But in the book of Kings it says “eighteen years old” (2 Kgs 24:8)! It might be that his father Jehoiakim, in the first year of his own reign, designated him to be king, to reign after him in his place. So it was then that he was eight years old. But at this point, when he took over for his father as king, he was eighteen years old.

Verse 10

<b>[Jehoiachin’s] brother Zedekiah.</b> He was really his uncle, as is recorded in the genealogies at the beginning of this book (1 Chr 3:15–16) and in the book of Kings (2 Kgs 24:17). But relatives can be called “brothers,” as in: “for we are brothers” (Gen 13:8), and in: “[Abraham’s] brother Lot” (Gen 14:16); for Lot was the <i>son</i> of Abraham’s brother (Gen 12:5).

<i><b>Mal‘ivim</i> [<i>… u-mitta‘te‘im</i>].</b> This is akin to: <i>mal‘igim … u-mitta‘te‘im</i> (ומתעתעים; =mocking … and playing tricks). On [the phrase] “and I shall appear to him <i>ki-meta‘tea‘</i>  (=as a trickster)” (Gen 27:12), the Targum renders <i>ke-mitla‘av</i>.
<b>On the agents of God.</b> These are the prophets, who are messengers of God, may He be blessed.
<i><b>U-mitta‘te‘im</i> (ומִתַּעתעים; =and playing tricks).</b> In principle this would feature a <i>tav</i> signaling the Hitpael: ומִתְתַּעתעים.
<b>To the point where it was beyond remedy.</b> [The Judeans] sinned so much that the option for repentance, which is the remedy, was taken away.

Verse 17

<b>Elderly or <i>yashesh</i> (=aged)—</b>with a <i>ṣerei</i>. This is equivalent to <i>yashish</i>—with a <i>ḥireq</i>.

Verse 20

<b>For [Nebuchadnezzar] and for his sons.</b> [This refers to] his son and his son’s son.
<b>Until the rise of the Persian kingdom.</b> This amounts to fifty-two years from the day [the Judeans] were exiled, until the land paid back its sabbaths (v. 21). For it was not until the second year of Darius, when the seventy-year term for Jerusalem’s destruction was fulfilled (Dan 9:2), that [Israel] was fully remembered [by God] (cf. Jer 29:10).

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>And in writing.</b> [Cyrus] had this proclaimed orally throughout his kingdom, and he also sent documents.

Verse 23

<b>And [God] <i>paqad ‘alay</i>.</b> [This means]: And He commanded me. But where did God command [Cyrus]? It is rather that He inspired him, prompting him to decide to let the exiled people go and <b>build Him a Temple in Jerusalem</b>. Alternatively, He commanded him through His prophets. Indeed, Isaiah prophesied, “Thus said the Lord to Cyrus, His anointed one … ‘It was I who inspired [Cyrus] to do the righteous thing and made all his ways just; he shall rebuild My city and let My exiled people go, not for any price or incentive,’ said the Lord of Hosts” (Isa 45:1, 13).
<b>Any one of you of all His people, the Lord his God be with him and let him go up.</b>
The commentary on Chronicles is thus completed.
