Radak on I Chronicles

Introduction

</b>David son of Joseph, the Spaniard, of the Kimḥi family said: This book, the book of Chronicles, is among the Holy Scriptures: it was written together with them because it contains an account of the history of the Judean kings. It begins by presenting, in abridged form, the genealogy from Adam to Noah; then from Noah to Abraham; and then from Abraham to David (1 Chr 1:1–2:15) because he is the essential one. Indeed, before it reaches David (2:15), it does not bother presenting the full genealogy of the Israelites—only that of Judah (2:3 ff.). Only afterward does it present some of the lines of the other tribes, in order to provide their population totals in the time of David (4:24–8:40). All genealogies of other nations of the world that it provides along the way serve to produce an orderly account of the world’s ancestry, the way it appears in the book of Genesis. But it presents all the rest of the genealogies with progressive abridgement. It also presents the kings of Edom, because eight kings and eleven chiefs ruled over them before any king ruled over the Israelites (1:43–54). But while among their kings there was not one who was the son of a previous king—rather, because people from other places dominated them, kings from those places ruled over them—each king in the Davidic dynasty was the son of a previous king. And for all the antiquity of the Edomite kingdom, it did not withstand the first king of Israel, namely David, as the text says, “and … the Edomites became vassals of David” (2 Sam 8:14). For even though Saul ruled over Israel first, this was not the primary kingship, and he reigned for only two years (1 Sam 13:1). (He nevertheless did do battle with the Edomites, and they could not contend with him [1 Sam 14:47[; but it was David who subjugated them [2 Sam 8:14].) The Davidic kingship, however, is the primary one according to the tradition and prophecy transmitted by our father Jacob and by our teacher Moses, may they be at peace; for Jacob said “The scepter shall not depart from Judah” (Gen 49:10), and Moses said “Hear, O Lord, the voice of Judah, and restore him to his people” (Deut 33:7).
Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Bava Batra 15a), say that Ezra wrote this book. But in fact, these chronicles of the Judean kings were written before Ezra, as it says in the book of Kings (1 Kgs 14:29); they just were not yet included in the Holy Scriptures. Rather, they were written as a separate book, among the chronicles of the Judean kings. Similarly, the chronicles of the [Northern] Israelite kings were written in a book; but that book was not included in the Holy Scriptures because the [Northern] Israelite kingship did not survive. In the future also, only the Davidic kingship will arise, as the prophet says, “and there shall be one prince for all of them” (cf. Ezek 37:24), and, “Never again shall they be two nations, and never again shall they be divided into two kingdoms” (Ezek 37:22). But the book of the chronicles of the Judean kings was properly included in the Holy Scriptures to relate events pertaining to the Judean kings and their exile, until their ascent from the exile. They had a prince over them from the Davidic dynasty—Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, grandson of Jehoiachin—and this book presents the royal descent up until Zerubbabel (1 Chr 3:19).
Ezra included this book in the Holy Scriptures on the authority of the prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi; and he included it in the Writings and not in the Prophets because it is a historical account. Because its main purpose is to provide the history and the genealogies, it is included among the Writings and recorded together with them even though there are some prophecies in it, just as the book of Ruth was composed to impart the genealogy of David and is therefore recorded together with the Writings.
This book contains very obscure matters, and matters contradicting those in Samuel and Kings. And because this book is a historical account, people have not regularly studied it, nor have I seen any of the early commentators attempt to elucidate it. I did, however, find some commentaries on this book here in Narbonne—I do not know the names of their authors—but I saw that they mostly adopt a midrashic approach. So when a certain scholar from Gerona, a student of my master, my father, of blessed memory, asked me to write a commentary on it, I saw fit to grant his request. But I did not expound one verse after another, only the verses that require interpretation. And with this I begin, with the help of Him who grants knowledge to human beings (cf. Ps 94:10).





Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>Adam, Seth, Enosh.</b> This is an account of one generation after another, as is “<b>Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared; Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech; Noah, Shem</b>.” But “Shem,<b> Ham and Japheth”</b> is akin to: “Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah” (Exod 1:2).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>The sons of Japheth.</b> The genealogies begin with Japheth as they do in the Torah (Gen 10:2), even though he is the youngest: because the text always refers to them as “Shem, Ham and Japheth,” it seems that this was the order of their births. When it says [that Shem was] “the brother of Japheth the <i>gadol</i>” (Gen 10:21), this does not mean [that Japheth was] older (<i>gadol</i>) in years but that he was greater (<i>gadol</i>) in stature. The fact that it mentions Shem in reference to him lends support to this. The reason that the text begins by presenting the progeny of the youngest is that the only important part of the account concerns Abraham, and it is in connection with him that it will present the genealogies at length. This, then, is why it presents the lines of Shem only at the end. It places Japheth before Ham because he was greater and more honorable than him, even though Japheth was younger in years.

Verse 6

<b>The sons of Gomer.</b> “<b>And Diphath</b>” has a <i>dalet</i>; but in the book of Genesis (10:3) [the name] appears with a <i>resh</i>.

Verse 7

<b>The sons of Javan.</b> The text leaves out Magog, Madai, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras—as it does in Genesis (10:3–5)—in order to be brief, because their progenies do not amount to anything important. As for Gomer and Javan, tbey might have been the heads of the families that descended from Japheth.
<b>Tarshishah.</b> In the book of Genesis (10:4) the text says “Tarshish.” They are one and the same.
<b>And Rodanim.</b> This appears with a <i>resh</i> at the beginning; but the book of Genesis (10:4) has <i>ve-Dodanim</i>, with two <i>dalet</i>s. Because <i>dalet</i> and <i>resh</i> look similar, some readers of ancient genealogical records read it with a <i>dalet</i>, while others read it with a <i>resh</i>. This, then, is how the name remained pronounced by people: with either a <i>dalet</i> or a <i>resh</i>. Therefore, one of the readings was recorded in the book of Genesis and the other in this book, to indicate that it is all one name even though some read it with a <i>dalet</i> and others with a <i>resh</i>. Similarly, “Riblah” (2 Kgs 25:7) has a <i>resh</i> while “Diblah” (Ezek 6:14) has a <i>dalet</i>, and “Deuel” (Num 1:14) has a <i>dalet</i> while “Reuel” (Num 2:14) has a <i>resh</i>. In the case of <i>vav</i> and <i>yod</i>, also, readings interchange because [the two letters] look similar. They also interchange for vowel-letters <i>alef</i> and <i>hei</i> at the end of a word, as in <i>savta</i> (סבתא; 1 Chr 1:9) and <i>savtah</i> (סבתה; Gen 10:7). After all, <i>alef</i> and <i>hei</i> are members of one class, the class of letters that represent [nothing more than] exhalation; so one may write either an <i>alef</i> or a <i>hei</i>, whatever one wishes. This function of the letters <i>alef</i>, <i>hei</i>, <i>vav</i>, and <i>yod</i> applies just the same to verbs, nouns, and particles, as we have explained fully in the grammar book that we have authored (<i>Sefer Mikhlol</i>). Even though there are midrashic expositions concerning the variation in the letters of these names, I did not see fit to record them, so that the task should not become too burdensome for me; for the main explanation is the one that I have provided.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Canaan fathered.</b> I saw that one of the commentators (Pseudo-Rashi) observes that the sons of Canaan total eleven, and that together with him they total twelve, so that when the verse says “He established the borders of nations according to the number of the sons of Israel” (Deut 32:8), it means the borders of Canaan and his sons, who are equal in number to Israel’s sons.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>The sons of Shem.</b> The list includes grandsons along with sons; for Uz, Hul, Gesher and Meshech were sons of Aram.
<b>And Meshech.</b> But in the book of Genesis (10:23) it says “and Mash.” They are phonetically similar, and he was called by both.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Joktan fathered. Hazarmaveth</b> is one word.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>Shem, Arpachshad.</b> At this point the text restricts the account of the genealogy to one man after another, from Shem to Abraham.

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

<b>Abram—that is, Abraham.</b> The text says “Abram” consistent with the way [one presents] genealogical lines; and “that is Abraham”—the famous one, whom God loved and whose name He aggrandized (Gen 12:2), making him a father of many nations (Gen 17:5). In the course of presenting the lines of Abraham, the text provides the lines of his son Ishmael and the sons of Keturah, and after that it states “Abraham fathered Isaac” (1 1:34) because he is the essential one.

Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

<b>The sons of Keturah, Abraham’s concubine.</b> Because the Torah says “Abraham took another woman (<i>ishah</i>)” (Gen 25:1), the text indicates here that she was only a concubine. When the Torah says that he took an <i>ishah</i>, it thus means that he took a certain woman (<i>ishah</i>) as a concubine, for he had no wife (<i>ishah</i>) other than our mother Sarah: the others were concubines. Indeed, it says in the Torah, “To Abraham’s sons by concubines …” (Gen 25:6).

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

<b>The sons of Esau.</b> Just as the text provides the lines of Abraham’s son Ishmael, it also provides the lines of Isaac’s son Esau and the kings who reigned over his nation before any king reigned over the Israelites (v. 43). For afterward they did not have kings, as I have said, because they were under the control of David until the sins of the Judean kings facilitated their rebellion against Judean rule (2 Chr 21:8–11).

Verse 36

<b>The sons of Eliphaz.</b> The text says “<b>Zephi</b>,” with a <i>yod</i>; but in the Torah (Gen 36:11) this appears as “Zepho,” with a <i>vav</i>.
<b>Kenaz, Timna, and Amalek.</b> From this verse it seems that Timna was a son of Eliphaz, but the Torah (Gen 36:12) says that Timna was a <i>concubine</i> of Eliphaz and that she bore him Amalek! Some explain (cf. Rashi ibid.) that Timna is the mother of Amalek as it says in the Torah, and that she was misbegotten. For Eliphaz had relations with Seir’s wife, the mother of Lotan, and she bore him Timna—either during his lifetime or after his death—and Ezra made a subtle observation in the Torah that there is a <i>paseq</i> after “Timna,” so that the intent is: “Gatam, Kenaz, and Timna” (Gen 36:11–12), meaning that she too was his daughter. Afterward, though, she became his concubine and bore him Amalek. It is for this reason, then, that the text says, “and Lotan’s sister was Timna” (Gen 36:22, I Chr 1:39)—not “Seir’s daughter,” but rather “Lotan’s sister.” But this interpretation is midrashic: had Timna been the daughter of Eliphaz, the text would not have included her in the list of sons; for Scripture does not do this without saying so explicitly, as in: “and his daughter Dinah” (Gen 46:15), and: “and their sister Serah” (Gen 46:17). In my view the text adopts an abridged style: because Ezra did not need to be explicit, inasmuch as the matter is explicit in the Torah, he presented the genealogical lines in abridged form. He was similarly brief concerning the sons of Shem, recording Shem’s grandsons in the list of sons for the purpose of brevity, so that when the text says “Aram [and Uz and Hul]” (1 Chr 1:17) it is as though it says, “<i>Aram’s sons were</i> Uz and Hul.” Here too, then, he was brief in writing “Timna.” Indeed, he could have been even briefer and written “Zepho, Gatam, Kenaz, and Amalek”; but because Amalek was not equal to the other sons—for they were sons of wives whereas he was the son of a concubine—he separated them by mentioning his mother. And it was adequate for him just to write “Timna,” because the matter is laid out in the Torah.

Verse 37



Verse 38

<b>The sons of Seir.</b> The text provides the sons of Seir also, just as it provides them in the Torah, because out of love for Isaac, God gave his son Esau the land of these chiefs, the descendants of Seir.

Verse 39

<b>The sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam—</b>with a <i>vav</i>; but in the Torah (Gen 36:22) this appears as “Hemam,” with a <i>yod</i>.

Verse 40

<b>The sons of Shobal: Alian.</b> But in the Torah (Gen 36:23) this appears as “Alvan,” with a <i>vav</i>.
<b>Shephi—</b>with a <i>yod</i>, but in the Torah (ibid.) this appears as “Shepho,” with a <i>vav</i>.

Verse 41

<b>The sons of Dishon.</b> But it the Torah (Gen 36:26) it says, “These are the sons of Dishan,” with a <i>qameṣ</i>. In truth, they were the sons of Dishon; for Dishon—with a <i>ḥolem</i>—was the fifth of Seir’s sons, whereas Dishan—with a <i>qameṣ</i>—was the seventh of Seir’s sons. This is in fact how the text records them in the Torah: “Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan” (Gen 36:21). But when it records their progeny it calls both of them “Dishan”—with a <i>qameṣ</i>: “The sons of Dishan were Hemdan and Eshban” (Gen 36:26)—then the sons of Ezer—and then: “the sons of Dishan were Uz and Aran” (Gen 36:28). Ezra, however, wrote “Dishon” for both of them. Apparently, concerning their names, they were not particular about the distinction between “Dishan” and “Dishon.”
<b>The sons of Dishon: Hamran—</b>with a <i>resh</i>; but in the Torah (Gen 36:26) this appears as “Hemdan,” with a <i>dalet</i>. I have already provided the reasons for such variations (v. 7).

Verse 42

<b>Zaavan and Jaakan—</b>with a <i>yod</i>; but in the Torah (Gen 36:27) this appears as “Vaakan,” with a <i>vav</i>.

Verse 43

<b>These are the kings … When Baal-hanan died, Hadad reigned in his stead—</b>with a <i>dalet</i>; but in the Torah (Gen 36:39) this appears as “Hadar,” with a <i>resh</i>.

Verse 44



Verse 45



Verse 46



Verse 47



Verse 48



Verse 49



Verse 50

<b>And the name of his city was Pai</b>—with a <i>yod</i>; but in the Torah (ibid.) this appears as “Pau,” with a <i>vav</i>.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>These are the sons of Israel.</b> The text begins by presenting the progeny of the sons of Judah, because the book is primarily about the Judean kings.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>The sons of Zerah: Zimri.</b> This is Zabdi the son of Zerah, who is mentioned in the book of Joshua (7:1).

Verse 7

<b>The sons of Carmi: Achar.</b> Even though Carmi was not listed, it was known that Carmi was a son of Zabdi, who is the same as Zimri mentioned above. Such is the tendency of this book when presenting genealogies in some cases. Achar is the same as Achan; but the text calls him “Achar” pejoratively, because he caused trouble for (<i>‘akhar</i>) Israel.

Verse 8

<b>And the sons of Ethan: Azariah.</b> This is similar to “The sons of Dan: Hushim” (Gen 46:23) and “The sons of Palu: Eliab” (Num 26:8). The author did not record the progeny of Heman, Calcol, and Darda; perhaps he did not find them. Alternatively, he abridged the progeny of Zerah because the kingship did not decend from them, and he returned to present the progeny of Hezron son of Perez because the kingship did descend from them.

Verse 9

<b>And Chelubai.</b> This is Caleb son of Hezron, whom the text mentions later (v. 18).

Verse 10

<b>Nahshon, prince of the sons of Judah.</b> It is written in this manner for the honor of David, to impart that even his grandfather Nahshon was a prince.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Jesse (<i>Ishay</i> [אישי]) fathered.</b> [The name] is the same whether [it begins with] an <i>alef</i> or a <i>yod</i>, because the letters <i>alef</i>, <i>hei</i>, <i>vav</i>, and <i>yod</i> can interchange.
<b>Shimea, the third.</b> This is the same as Shammah mentioned in the book of Samuel (1 16:9).

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>David, the seventh.</b> R. Jonah [ibn Janaḥ] explains that this is akin to “the eighth,” because Jesse had seven sons besides David. For it says in the book of Samuel, “Jesse presented seven of his sons before Samuel” (1 16:10), at which point Samuel says to him, “Are these all the boys you have?” (1 16:11), and he responds, “There is still the smallest one” (ibid.). Furthermore, it says, “He had eight sons” (1 17:12). So if he had eight sons, and David was the eighth, “David, the seventh” must then mean “David, the eighth.” But this substitution is impossible! In truth, it is possible that Jesse had a son from another wife, and that in the book of Samuel, the text counts all of them when saying “seven of his sons” and then “There still remains the smallest one.” Here, however, it mentions the seven that were of the same mother as David. The scholar R. Abraham Ibn Ezra in fact explained it this way (<i>Sefer Ṣaḥot</i> 72b). There are some, however, who say that another son had died. In the Midrash (Midrash Tehillim 119:81), it says that the name of the eighth son was Elihu, the one mentioned among the officers whom David appointed over Judah: “Elihu, of the brothers of David” (1 Chr 27:18). And he was younger than David; so when the text says “and David was the smallest” (1 Sam 17:14), it is only because he made himself small that it calls him “small.”

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>Jether the Ishmaelite.</b> This is Jithra the Israelite who is mentioned in the book of Samuel (2 17:25): the text calls him “the Ishmaelite” because he resided in the land of Ishmael. The reason it calls him “the Israelite” is so that nobody should think that, beacuase he was called “the Ishmaelite,” he was of Ishmaelite descent. Rather, he was of Israelite descent.

Verse 18

<b>Caleb the son of Hezron.</b> Some of our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Sotah 11b), say that this is Caleb the son of Jephunneh; and why was he called “the son of Jephunneh?” Because he turned (<i>panah</i>) away from the plot of the spies. They also say that when the text says “Othniel son of Kenaz, brother of Caleb” (Jos 15:17), it means that he was his brother by his mother, so that Caleb was not the son of Kenaz but rather his stepson—that is, the son of his wife. They say that this is implied by a textual subtlety, where it says “the Kenizite” (Num 32:12) instead of “the son of Kenaz.” It does not seem so, however, according to the plain sense of the verses. For according to the plain sense, it seems that this Caleb was among the earlier sons of Hezron, in that it says (v. 21) that afterward, he took the daughter of Machir when he was sixty years old. If, however, the matter is as our Sages said—that he was Caleb the son of Jephunneh—then when Hezron fathered Caleb, Hezron would have been one hundred and seventy years old! For Caleb said, “I was forty years old when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me” (Jos 14:7), and that was in the second year after they left Egypt, whereas Hezron was among those who came <i>to</i> Egypt (Gen 46:8, 12).
<b>Fathered Azubah Ishah and Jerioth (<i>holid et ‘Azuvah Ishah ve-et Yeri‘ot</i>).</b> Yet afterward the text says, “When Azubah died [Caleb married Ephrath]” (1 Chr 2:19)—and, [moreover], it says [here] “<b>and these were her sons</b>”—so it seems that these were Caleb’s wives <i>and</i> it seems that they were his daughters! Our Sages, of blessed memory (cf. Exodus Rabbah 1:17), likewise ask: Is there a person who fathers his wives?! And they provide midrashic interpretations. But to my mind this <i>et</i> is like <i>min</i> (=from), as in <i>ke-ṣeti et ha-‘ir</i> (=when I go out from the city; Exod 9:29) and others like it. This, then, is the meaning of the verse: Caleb the son of Hezron fathered children <i>from</i> his wife Azubah and <i>from</i> Jerioth: both of them were his wives, and he had children from both of them. But the text keeps the genealogical lines brief, recording the sons of only one of them, namely Azubah: it is with respect to her that it says “and these were her sons.” And when Azubah then died, Caleb took another wife named “Ephrath” (v. 19).

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>Afterward Hezron had relations.</b> The text says “<b>when he was sixty years old</b>” because the other wives whom it mentions he had already taken beforehand. Only afterward, when he was sixty years old and an old man, did he take the daughter of Machir …. All of these births were in Egypt, because Hezron was among those who came to Egypt.

Verse 22

<b>Segub fathered Jair.</b> It seems from the Torah (Num 32:41; Deut 3:14) that Jair was from the tribe of Manasseh, and that he is the one who took the cities in the land of Gilead and named them “Havvoth-jair,” for himself. The text relates the entire story here also, to impart that this is the Jair mentioned in the Torah. Here, however, it connects him to the tribe of Judah—indeed correctly. For when the Torah (ibid.) says “the son of Manasseh,” it means on his grandmother’s side, because his father’s mother was the daughter of Machir son of Manasseh (1 Chr 1:21). And because Jair took the cities in the land of Gilead, he remained there with the tribe of his grandmother, and those cities became his portion (Deut 3:14). But our Sages say (b. Bava Batra 112a) that this is not the Jair who is mentioned in the Torah. Rather, this Jair son of Segub took a wife in the land of Gilead, and when she died he inherited what was hers; so he had these twenty-three cities from his wife’s inheritance.

Verse 23

<b>Geshur and Aram took.</b> The text indicates that these cities that Jair took were taken away from his grandchildren by Geshur and Aram, who were neighboring nations, as it says, “Until the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites” (Deut 3:14).
<b>All of these were the sons of Machir, the father of Gilead.</b> This means: All these cities <i>belonged to</i> the sons of Machir the father of Gilead—by which it means: to the sons of Machir’s daughter—and the text elides the prepositional <i>lamed</i>. The same is true for: “There were two company-commanders who were the son of Saul” (2 Sam 4:2), which means “<i>for</i> the son of Saul,” and many like it that elide the prepositional <i>lamed</i>. Based on this, our Sages, of blessed memory (cf. b. Yevamot 62b), say that grandsons, even sons of daughters, are like sons. But this does not hold true with respect to the law. Now they explain “the sons of” in keeping with its straightforward sense, not as “belonged to the sons of,” as we explain it. But our interpretation is correct; for if the text says this concerning the sons, what does “All of these” mean, when it only mentioned Segub and Jair? Rather, it refers to the cities—the “sixty cities” that the text mentions. It is possible that when the text refers to twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead (1 Chr 1:22), they are included in the sixty cities mentioned, for these sixty cities are also in the land of Gilead. When it says “twenty-three,” then, it means the large cities, and when it says “sixty,” it means together with their dependencies.

Verse 24

<b>After the death of Hezron <i>be-Kalev Efratah</i>.</b> Some say (Pseudo-Rashi) that they named the city “Caleb-ephrathah” for Caleb and his wife, in which case Hezron was among those who came to the land of Israel and died there. But this interpretation— that Hezron lived for more than two hundred and fifty years—is improbable. To my mind the meaning is: When his son Caleb took his wife Ephrathah, at that very point Hezron died.
<b>Abijah, wife of Hezron.</b> Because the text had said that in his old age he took Machir’s daughter, it indicates that when he died, he had another wife named Abijah and that she <b>bore him Ashhur, the father of Tekoa</b>, either during his lifetime or after his death.

Verse 25

<b>The sons of Jerahmeel.</b> The text initially presents the progeny of Ram son of Hezron (vv. 10–17), because he is the one who is essential for presenting the family of David; then afterward, following [the progeny of] Ram, it presents the progeny of Caleb son of Hezron (vv. 18–20); and now it returns to present the progeny of the first-born; that is, Jerahmeel.

Verse 26

<b>Jerahmeel had another (<i>aḥeret</i>) wife, whose name was Atarah.</b> According to the plain sense of the verse she was an Israelite, and it says “another” because it mentioned the first one. Even should you say that she was a concubine, as in: “you are the son of a woman of another status (<i>aḥeret</i>)” (Judg 11:2), she was still an Israelite. But our Sages, of blessed memory (y. Sanhedrin 11b), explain midrashically that she was a gentile, and that for this reason the text mentions that her name was Atarah; for he took her as an adornment for himself (<i>le-hit‘ater bah</i>), because she was the daughter of people of distinction. Based on this they say (cf. Midrash Zuta Ruth 1:12): Do not trust a convert until twenty-four generations. For there are twenty-four generations from Atarah until Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, who killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam (2 Kgs 25:25). They consist of Atarah, Onam, Shammai, Nadab, Appaim, Ishi, Sheshan, Sheshan’s daughter, Attai, Nathan, Zabad, Ephlal, Obed, Jehu, Azariah, Helez, Eleasah, Sisamai, Shallum, Jekamiah, Elishama, Nethaniah, and Ishmael, who together with Jarha—the father of Attai—who was a slave (1 Chr 2:34), total twenty-four.

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b>Sheshan had no sons.</b> But it says, “The sons of Sheshan: Ahlai” (v. 31)! The point, rather, it is that Ahlai died in his father’s lifetime, and so there was no son or daughter left by him.
<b>Sheshan had an Egyptian slave, whose name was Jarha (ירחע),</b> who grew up with him and was a member of his household, like Abraham’s slave Eliezer, and he gave him his daughter (v. 35) after he freed him. In a midrashic vein: It is from the name that they deduced that he made him a freeman; for ירחע stands for עבד חרי (<i>‘eved ḥarrei</i>; “a freed slave”): the <i>‘ayin</i> stands for עבד (<i>‘eved</i>; =slave), and ירח backward is חרי (<i>ḥarrei</i>; =free). It is based on this that [the Sages] say (cf. b. Pesaḥim 113b): When your daughter matures, free your slave and give her to him. But even though Sheshan freed Jarha, he violated the Torah when he gave him his daughter, because Jarha was a first-generation Egyptian convert (cf. Deut 23:8–9). They also say based on this (y. Horayot 19a): Do not trust a slave until sixteen generations; for there are sixteen generations from Jarha until Ishmael son of Nethaniah.

Verse 42

<b>The sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel.</b> Having presented the progeny of Jerahmeel, the text proceeds to complete the progeny of Caleb, whatever was not recorded above (vv. 18–20).
<b>Meshah his first-born.</b> For those mentioned above were not [Caleb’s] first sons. The text nonetheless places them earlier—perhaps they were the most important of his sons. It does the same for the sons whom he had by Ephrath, for the honor of Bezalel. This accounts for the formulation above, “and these were <i>her</i> sons” (v. 18); that is, he himself already had sons, but these he had by Azubah.
<b>Who was the father of Ziph.</b> Ziph was well known; that is why it says “the father of.” The same is true for “Machir father of Gilead” (v. 21) and many others. Perhaps the city Ziph (Jos 15:24) was named for him. Some explain (Pseudo-Rashi) “the father of Ziph” to mean the chief of Ziph, meaning that Meshah was the chief who ruled the city that was called Ziph. But the first explanation is correct.
<b>The sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron.</b> To my mind, “Ziph” is elided: because the text just mentioned him, it relies on the reader’s understanding and leaves him out. It is as though it had said, “The sons of Ziph: Mareshah father of Hebron.”

Verse 45



Verse 46



Verse 47

<b>The sons of Jahdai.</b> He is one of the sons mentioned, and he had two names.

Verse 48

<b>Maacah was the concubine of Caleb, who fathered (<i>pilegesh Kalev Ma‘akhah yalad).</i></b> <i>Yalad</i> does not refer back to Maacah—for then the text would have said <i>yaledah</i> (=bore)—but rather to Caleb. It is as though it had said, “Maacah was the concubine of Caleb<i>, and he</i> fathered (<i>pilegesh Kalev Ma‘akhah ve-yalad</i>) <b>Sheber and Tirhanah</b> by her.”

Verse 49



Verse 50

<b>These were the sons of Caleb son of Hur.</b> This means that those whom the text lists now, Shobal and the others, were sons of Caleb son of Hur, who is the grandson of Caleb son of Jephunneh. Having presented above the progeny of Uri son of Hur (v. 20), it says here that Hur had another son named Caleb and that these were his sons.
<b>Father of (<i>avi</i>) Kiriath-jearim.</b> Some explain (commentary attributed to student of Saadia): the <i>ruler</i> of Kiriath-jearim; and the same for “<i>avi</i> Bethlehem” (v. 51) and “<i>avi</i> Beth-gader” (ibid.). But it is possible to interpret <i>avi</i> according to its plain sense, meaning “father of Kiriath-jearim”: because all the people of Kiriath-jearim were his children and grandchildren, and the entire city was settled by his descendants, the text puts them together and says “father of Kiriath-jearim.” The same [may be said] for “<i>avi</i> Bethlehem” and “<i>avi</i> Beth-gader.”

Verse 51



Verse 52

<i><b>Haro’eh ḥaṣi ha-menuḥot</i>.</b> Some explain (Pseudo-Rashi) that he ruled over a city named “Manahath,” the one mentioned below (1 2:54, 8:6), and that the meaning of <i>ha-ro’eh</i> is that he would supervise (<i>ro’eh</i>) the matters of the city and rule over it. Some explain (commentary attributed to student of Saadia) that he ruled over half (<i>haṣi</i>) of Jerusalem, which is called <i>menuḥah</i> (=tranquility). And some explain (cf. Targum) that he was the supervisor and appointee over half of the offerings (<i>ḥaṣi ha-menaḥot</i>) that came to Jerusalem from all the nations. There are still other interpretations that I did not see fit to record; and even those that I have recorded do not seem correct to me. What does seem correct in my view is that <i>Haro’eh Ḥaṣi-ha-menuḥot</i> consists of names of sons of Shobal—additional sons, beyond those who settled in Kiriath-jearim: one’s name was “Haroeh,” and the other’s name was “Hazi-hammenuhoth.” One should not be surprised by a combination of names of people that resembles something with a meaning. After all, the text presents the combination “Giddalti and Romamti” (1 Chr 25:4) which resembles something with a meaning, and yet they are names of people. And there are other examples besides these.

Verse 53

<b>And the families of Kiriath-jearim: the Ithrites, the Puthites.</b> This means: All the people of Kiriath-jearim, who were the descendants of Shobal, were divided into these families, and those who are mentioned were the heads of the families. Each family is identified in reference to the household of its ancestor, as in: “Of Imnah, the family of the Imnites … of Beriah, the family of the Beriites” (Num 26:44); and so for all of them.
<b>From these came the Zorathite and the Eshtaolite clans.</b> Zorah and Eshtaol are two places in the land of Judah: people from the families of Kiriath-jearim went out and built these two places and settled them, and they became two families called Zorathites and Eshtaolites. Even though the text says, “The spirit of the Lord first moved him in the Camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol” (Judg 13:25), [this area] did not belong to the tribe of Dan but to the tribe of Judah, as did Kiriath-jearim. Yet it was called “the Camp of Dan,” because people of Dan encamped in those places until their portion fell to them. Thus it says, “They went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That is why that place is called ‘the Camp of Dan’ to this day” (Judg 18:12).

Verse 54

<b>The sons of Salma: Bethlehem.</b> [This is to be understood] in line with our explanation (v. 50) of “Salma father of Bethlehem” (v. 51). And there was another family of his descendants called <b>the Netophathites</b>.
<b>Atroth-beth-joab.</b> This is also the name of a family. Alternatively, it is the name of a city, similar to “Atroth-shophan” (Num 32:35), and the entire city was populated by his descendants.
<b>And the Hazi-manahathites, the Zorites.</b> These are also names of families.

Verse 55

<b>And the families of the scribes that dwelt at Jabez.</b> This means that these families were also among the descendants of Salma.
<b>Scribes.</b> For they were scribes and teachers. They were the inhabitants of the city named Jabez. It is possible that Jabez built it and that it was named for him.
<b>The Tirathites, the Shimeathites, the Sucathites.</b> These are names of families. There are many midrashic explanations of these names; but if we were to undertake to provide midrashic explanations for why all the names were called as they were, no book could contain them. We are only concerned, then, with what we find recorded. For all the names had explanations known to them; indeed, these are recorded in connection with a few of them. We should not, however, pursue those whose explanations are not recorded.
<b>These are the Kenites (הקינים).</b> This is how I found it in a carefully written manuscript: הקינים with a <i>ṣerei</i> under the <i>qof</i>. But in other manuscripts, also carefully written, I have found the <i>qof</i> with a <i>ḥireq</i>. The masoretic notation on it is: “No other occurrence; but one <i>qinim va-hegeh</i> (=lamentations and woes; Ezek 2:10).” The Kenites were similarly a well known family. Some say that they were smiths, based on the Targum of “and he gave it to a smith” (cf. Judg 17:4): <i>ve-yahbeh le-qena’ah</i>. But our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Sotah 11a), say that they are among the descendants of Keni, the father-in-law of Moses, and that they became mingled with the families of Judah, and thus their genealogy was presented together with them.
<b>From Hammath, father of the house of Rechab.</b> This is the family of the house of the Rechabites mentioned in the book of Jeremiah (35:2). The name of the father of that family was Hammath.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>These were the sons of David.</b> Because the text presented above (2:10–17) the family of Ram until David, but it refrained from completing those lines in order to present those of Ram’s brother Caleb, it returns now, upon completing the lines of Caleb, to complete the Davidic lineage.
<b>The second one Daniel.</b> Yet in the book of Samuel (2 3:3) he is called Chileab. There is a midrashic explanation of this (Tanḥuma Toledot 6): Because David married Abigail after the death of Nabal (1 Sam 25:39–42), the scoffers of the generation said that this child born to Abigail was the son of Nabal. His countenance thus appeared in the likeness of David’s in order to remove suspicion. Hence he called him Chileab (<i>Kil’av</i>); that is, <i>domeh la-av</i> (=in the likeness of the father). But Daniel was his main name, meaning <i>danani Elohay mi-Naval</i> (=my God has vindicated me in the matter of Nabal).

Verse 2

<b>The third one Absalom (<i>le-Avshalom</i>) son of Maacah.</b> The <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-Avshalom</i> refers to the pure substance of the thing and does not relate anything else to the substance; so when the text says <i>le-Avshalom</i>, it is as if it had just said <i>Avshalom</i>. This <i>lamed</i> is like those in <i>haregu le-Avner</i> (=had killed Abner; 2 Sam 3:30), <i>le-kol kelav ta‘aseh neḥoshet</i> (=make all its utensils of copper; Exod 27:3), <i>anush le-shivrekh</i> (=your wound is severe; Jer 30:12), and others besides these, which I have cited in the <i>Mikhlol</i> in the section on grammar (194a).

Verse 3

<b>Ithream, by his wife Eglah.</b> [The Sages] say that this is Michal daughter of Saul (b. Sanhedrin 21a): it is for this reason that the text says “his wife,” meaning his first one. And when the verse says, “So to her dying day Michal daughter of Saul had no children” (2 Sam 6:23), it means that from that day onward she had none, as punishment for scorning David for dancing wildly before the Lord. But beforehand she did have [a child].

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>These were born (<i>nulledu</i> [נוּלּדו]) to him in Jerusalem.</b> The gemination of the <i>lamed</i> of <i>nulledu</i> takes the place of the [preceding] vowel-letter: even though the <i>vav</i> is written here, it is incorporated into the gemination.
<b>Four by Bath-shua daughter of Ammiel.</b> This is Bathsheba daughter of Eliam (2 Sam 11:3), only some called her Bath-shua and some Bathsheba, because they are similar. Likewise, Ammiel and Eliam are one and the same, only the letters are transposed.  These four sons are not mentioned in the order of their births. For Solomon was the eldest: he was the first son born by Bathsheba to David after the death of the child, as the text says, “David consoled his wife Bathsheba; he went to her ... she bore him a son, and he called him Solomon” (cf. 2 Sam 12:24). Now in the book of Samuel, when the text lists the children of David born to him in Jerusalem (2 Sam 5:14–16), it does not mention the first Eliphelet and Nogah (1 Chr 3:6–8)—perhaps they were not alive then, and so it does not list them. But in this book it does list them, even though the two of them were not alive. For it lists those born to him in Jerusalem; and because it says here “All the sons of David” (v. 9), it lists them all. In another place in this book where it again lists them (1 14:4–7), it similarly lists them all: even though it does not say “All these are the sons of David,” it does after all say “whom he had in Jerusalem” (ibid.).

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>And Eliphelet</b> (the second one)<b>.</b> Perhaps the first one had already died when he named the latter one. But in the second list in this book (ibid.) there is a slight difference between them, as the first is <i>Elpalet</i> and the second <i>Elifalet</i>.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>The son of Solomon: Rehoboam.</b> The text leaves aside the other sons and presents the progeny of Solomon, because the kingship belonged to him and to his children after him. It then presents the royal lineage of Judah, one generation after another.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>The sons of Josiah: Johanan the <i>bekhor</i> (=first-born).</b> This is Jehoahaz, whom Pharaoh Neco took and exiled to Egypt, where he died (2 Kgs 23:34); and he had two names. How then could the text say “the first-born?” After all, Jehoiakim was two years older than he! For it says “Jehoahaz was twenty-three … when he became king” (2 Kgs 23:31) and “Jehoiakim was twenty-five … when he became king” (2 Kgs 23:36); and there were only three months between their respective ascents to the throne (2 Kgs 23:31–34). Rather, it calls him <i>bekhor</i> because he was the <i>bekhor</i> for kingship, meaning that he reigned first. This is how our Sages, of blessed memory, explain it (b. Horayot 11b).
<b>The third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.</b> Our Sages, of blessed memory (ibid.), say that Shallum is Zedekiah, and that the text calls him Shallum because he was wholesome (<i>mushlam</i>) in his deeds. For he was righteous—it was the people of his generation who were wicked. Furthermore, it calls him Shallum because the Davidic kingship came to a close (<i>shalemah</i>) in his day. And it says concerning him “the third” because he was the third son of Josiah, and “the fourth” because he was the fourth since Josiah’s reign. But it does not seem so according to the plain sense. Rather, this Shallum is Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim son of Josiah. We cannot say that Josiah had another son named “Shallum”; for among the kings who reigned after Josiah we find only Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, and in the book of Jeremiah, Shallum is called a king: “concerning Shallum son of Josiah … who succeeded his father Josiah as king” (Jer 22:11). The concern of that entire prophecy is rather Jehoiachin, who was exiled to Babylon; and when it says “son of Josiah,” this is because he was his grandson, and grandsons are like sons: one finds this in many places. And whereaes here too the text records him in the list of Josiah’s sons, this is only because he preceded his uncle Zedekiah in assuming the Josiahide kingship. This, in fact, is why it proceeds to mention him again—in the appropriate list (v. 16).

Verse 16

<b>The descendants of Jehoiakim: his son Jeconiah, his son Zedekiah.</b> Jeconiah named his son Zedekiah after his uncle Zedekiah.

Verse 17

<b>And the sons of Jeconiah: Assir, Shealtiel his son.</b> These were both his sons. They called him Assir because he was born in prison (<i>bet ha-asurin</i>). After all, the prophet wrote of Jeconiah, “Record this man as childless, one who shall never prosper” (Jer 22:30)! [The Sages], accordingly, say that he repented in prison and returned to God with all his heart, and that God responded to him and gave him sons (cf. Leviticus Rabbah 10:5). And when he left prison, he named one Assir because he was born in prison (<i>bet ha-asurin</i>), and the other Shealtiel because the Davidic kingship was taken away (<i>nishtalleh</i>) from him. They also say (b. Sanhedrin 37b): “Rabbi Johanan said: Exile atones for everything. For it says ‘Record this man as childless,’ and after he went to exile it says ‘Assir his son, Shealtiel his son’ (cf. our verse)—‘Assir’ because his mother conceived him in prison (<i>bet ha-asurin</i>), and ‘Shealtiel’ because God implanted him (<i>shetalo El</i>) in an unusual manner: although we have learned that a woman cannot conceive while standing, she did conceive while standing. Another interpretation: [The name] ‘Shealtiel’ relates to [God’s] annulment of His curse (<i>nish’al ‘al alato</i>); and [the name] ‘Zerubbabel’ (v. 19) refers to [Zerubbabel’s] conception in Babylon (<i>nizra‘ be-Bavel</i>). For what was his actual name? His name was Nehemiah son of Hacaliah.”

Verse 18

<b>Malchiram, Pedaiah.</b> These are all sons of Shealtiel. But the text deploys an abridged style and does not say “The sons of Shealtiel,” because in all these cases it is understood that it lists father and son.

Verse 19

<b>The sons of Pedaiah: Zerubbabel and Shimei.</b> When the text says in Haggai (1:1), Zechariah (?), and Ezra (Ezra 3:2), “Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,” this is because he was his grandson; for Pedaiah was the son of Shealtiel, and Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah. After all, one finds many places where the text mentions grandsons as sons.
<b>The son of Zerubbabel: Meshullam.</b> This is equivalent to: “The <i>sons</i> of Zerubbabel.” The same is true for “The son of Hananiah” (v. 21) and “The son of Neariah” (v. 23).

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<b>The sons of Judah: Perez, Hezron, Carmi.</b> The text proceeds to fill in the lines of Judah not recorded above, recording—in abridged form—sons and grandsons in order.
<b>Hur and Shobal.</b> This is the Hur mentioned above: “Caleb son of Hur the first-born of Ephrathah” (2:50). This Hur was the son of Caleb son of Jephunneh: he was the father of the Caleb who was the father of Shobal, as indicated above (ibid.). Here, the text completes his progeny.

Verse 2

<b>Reaiah son of Shobal.</b> Reaiah (<i>Re’ayah</i>) is the same as Haroeh (<i>Ha-ro’eh</i>) mentioned above: “Shobal … had sons: Haroeh, Hazi-hammenuhoth” (2:52). For <i>Ha-ro’eh</i> (הרואה) and <i>Re’ayah</i> (ראיה) are one and the same, as it is common for letters in names to change position.
<b>These were the families of the Zorathite clan.</b> This is the same as the one mentioned above: “From these came the Zorathites and the Eshtaolites” (2:53), only here the text lists Jahath, Ahumai and Lahad, who were the main Zorathite families.

Verse 3

<b>And these: the father of Etam.</b> This means: And these were additional descendants of Shoval and of Hur: the father of Etam, <b>Jezreel</b> ….
<b>And the name of their sister was Hazlelponi.</b> Perhaps the reason the text mentions their sister—and the sister of the sons of Zerubbabel above (“And Shelomit was their sister” [3:19])—is that they did not have others; so it mentions these. Alternatively, these were famous and important women in their time, and so it mentions them as it does in the case of Serah daughter of Asher (1 Chr 7:30).

Verse 4

<b>The father of Bethlehem.</b> In order to be brief, the text does not mention Salma, who was the father of Bethlehem. Rather, it says “the sons of Hur … the father of Bethlehem”; for Hur was the father of Salma, and Salma was the father of Bethlehem (1 Chr 2:50–51).

Verse 5

<b>Ashhur the father of Tekoa had.</b> This is the one mentioned above (2:24) as the son of Hezron, who begot him by his wife Abijah. But above the text did not list any more of his progeny, only that he was “the father of Tekoa” (ibid.); so here it completes his progeny.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>Jabez was more esteemed than his brothers.</b> Perhaps Jabez is one of those listed, and he had two names. Or he is an additional one, and the text records his story even though it does not list him in the genealogical sequence.
<b>Jabez (</b>יעבץ<b>).</b> Even though, considering the story, this involves a transposition [of letters]—for according to the story it should have said יעצב—Hebrew-speakers are not particular on this, as in the cases of <i>Noaḥ</i> (=Noah), from <i>yenaḥamenu</i> (=will provide us relief; Gen 5:29); <i>Qayin</i> (קין; =Cain), from <i>qaniti</i> (קניתי; =I have gained; Gen 4:1); and <i>Shemu’el</i> (=Samuel), from <i>me-Adonay she’iltihu</i> (=I asked the Lord for him; cf. 1 Sam 1:20).

Verse 10

<b>Jabez called out.</b> Perhaps he was concerned about his name, which is related to [the word meaning] pain (עצב)—as it says, “<b>that I not suffer pain (לבלתי עצבי)</b>”—and he was concerned that his dealings would not turn out right, and that he would experience pain in his dealings with the world. So he made a vow that, should God make him succeed, he would do such and such—but it does not say what he vowed. This is also true for [the verse], “Jacob then made a vow, saying, ‘If God remains with me …’” (Gen 28:20) according to some of the commentators, and for [the verse], “Then Israel made a vow … and said, ‘If you deliver this people’” etc. (Num 21:2).
<i><b>Ve-‘asita</i> (=and make/do) that from misfortune I not suffer pain (<i>me-ra‘ah le-bilti ‘oṣbi)</i>.</b> This means: And make <i>for me</i> that I not suffer pain from misfortune, meaning that You should make <i>a sign for me</i> that I will not suffer pain from misfortune in the world, and that my name not cause me any pain. <i>‘Oṣbi</i> is then the infinitive of an intransitive verb, with the pronoun and the infinitive relating to one person: it does not indicate a subject and an object. Alternatively, it is a transitive verb, and the meaning is: And You will act on my behalf to save me from misfortune, such that it not cause me pain.

Verse 11

<b>Chelub the brother of Shuhah.</b> Even though the text does not mention him in the genealogical sequence, it mentions him [here] to relate his lines. One finds this in many places in the book, because it keeps the genealogical lines brief.

Verse 12

<b>Father of the Ir-nahash.</b> This is akin to “father of Kiryath-jearim” (1 Chr 2:50): the city called “Ir-nahash” was settled by his sons.
<b>These were the men of Recah.</b> All these sons of Chelub who are listed were called “men of Recah” for a reason known to them.

Verse 13

<b>The sons of Kenaz: Othniel.</b> Even though the text had not mentioned Kenaz, it mentions his lines, as we have written (v. 11).

Verse 14

<b>Father of Ge-harashim.</b> This is akin to “father of Kiryath-jearim” (1 Chr 2:50) in the sense that we have written (v. 12). The text indicates why the city was called “Ge-harashim”—<b>because they were craftsmen (<i>ḥarashim</i>)</b>. This means: crafters of stone, wood and iron; for each of them is called a <i>ḥarash</i>.

Verse 15

<b>The sons of Caleb son of Jephunneh.</b> We have already written )1 Chr 2:18) that the view of our Sages, of blessed memory, is that he is the same as Caleb son of Hezron, even though the text provides additional lines not provided above (1 Chr 2:18–55).
<b>And the sons of Elah: Uknaz.</b> That was his name: “Uknaz,” with a <i>vav</i>.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>The sons of Ezrah: Jether, Mered … and she bore (<i>vattahar et)</i> Miriam.</b> The meaning of <i>vattahar</i> is like that of <i>vatteled</i> (=she bore). Similarly, ‘<i>al birkhot horay</i> (=over the blessings of my ancestors; Gen 49:26) is akin to <i>yoleday</i> (=those who bore me). It is concerning the wife of Mered that the text says that she bore him—[that is,] Mered—Miriam, <b>Shammai</b>, etc.
<b>Miriam.</b> This is a son like the others: we find many names used for both males and females, such as Abijah the wife of Hezron (1 Chr 2:24), Ephah the concubine of Caleb (1 Chr 2:46), and many others. The end of the passage proves that “and she bore Miriam” refers to the wife of Mered. Similarly, “And his wife, the Judahite, bore Jered” (v. 18) means Mered’s wife.

Verse 18

<b>The Judahite.</b> This means that the first one mentioned was not a Judahite: she was Bithiah daughter of Pharaoh mentioned at the end of the passage.
<b>Jered father of Gedor.</b> Some explain (Pseudo Rashi) all these cases of “father of” as “master of,” and they explain Gedor, <b>Soco</b>, and <b>Zenoah</b> as the names of the cities over which these people ruled. But the truth is these terms they mean what they say: they are all names of sons born to each respective person. One finds several such cases in the [biblical] context where we made our introductory remarks [on this issue] (1 Chr 2:42): in the event that the son was more highly regarded and famous than the father, the text identifies the father in reference to the son.
<b>These were the sons of Bithiah daughter of Pharaoh.</b> This means: Those mentioned earlier—Miriam, Shammai, etc. (v. 17)—were sons of Bithiah daughter of Pharaoh, <b>whom Mered</b>, the son of Ezrah the descendent of Caleb son of Jephunneh, <b>married</b>. But our Sages, of blessed memory, explain midrashically (b. Sanhedrin 19b; Megillah 13a) that Mered is Caleb son of Jephunneh. And why was he called Mered? Because he rebelled (<i>marad</i>) against the plot of the spies. All these names—Jered, Abi-gedor, and Heber—they explain midrashically to refer to Moses, our teacher; and “bore” is to be understood as “raised,” because he was like a son to her.

Verse 19

<b>The sons of the wife of Hodiah.</b> Even though this Hodiah was not mentioned before now, the text provides his line. Such is the practice of the book, as we have written (1 Chr 4:11). It was from his wife the <b>sister of Naham</b> that he had these sons—<b>the father of Keilah the Garmite, and Eshtemoa the Maacathite</b>.

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>The sons of Shelah son of Judah.</b> All the lines provided until now are from Perez and Zerah: the text did not, to this point, list any of the descendants of Shelah. But now, when completing the lines of Judah, it lists a few of the descendants of Shelah.
<b>And the families of the linen factory.</b> This means that those families were flax-workers.

Verse 22

<b>And Jokim, and the men of Cozeba.</b> There are many midrashic explanations of these names: [The Sages] explain (b. Bava Batra 91b) <b>Joash and Saraph</b> to be Mahlon and Chilion, <i><b>asher ba‘alu le-Moav</b></i> to mean that they married Moabite women, and <i><b>ve-yashuvi</i> (וישבי) <i>Laḥem</b></i> to mean that they were from Bethlehem in Judah. They also provide many midrashic explanations (ibid.) of the verse “These were the potters …” (v. 23). But the plain meaning of the verse is that all these are sons and grandsons of Shelah: all the people of Cozeba were his descendants (perhaps Cozeba is Chezib [Gen 38:5]); Joash and Saraph were also his descendants, with <i>asher ba‘alu le-Moav</i> meaning that they fought the Moabites and were their masters; and <i>Yashuvi Laḥem</i> (=Jashubi-lehem) was also one of his descendants.
<b>The matters have been reliably transmitted.</b> This means: Our earlier remark that Joash and Saraph became masters over Moab, although not found in the prophetic books, is known by a tradition that was carefully transmitted, received, and relayed from one man to the next. But some explain (cf. the commentary attributed to a student of Saadia) that “The matters have been reliably transmitted” refers to all the genealogical lines recorded to this point by Ezra: it means that even though what is written here cannot be found in any of the prophetic books, you should not ask how Ezra knew all these things that did not happen in his time—for they are all traditions.

Verse 23

<b>These were the potters, dwellers of <i>neta‘im</i> and <i>gederah</i>.</b> It might be that this refers to the people of Cozeba mentioned above (v. 22), and that it means that these people were well-known potters—expert crafters of pottery vessels—who dwelt outside the city where the crops (<i>neta‘im</i>) were, to plant crops and work the land and to make the vessels there. It also might be that the earth in that place was good for crafting, and that they lived there, planting crops and erecting fences (<i>gederot</i>).
<b>In the king’s service.</b> They were also in the king’s service outside [the city], attending to the crops and the fences; and <b>they dwelt there</b> because of their work.

Verse 24

<b>The sons of Simeon.</b> The text provides an abridged account of Simeon’s progeny after that of Judah because their portions rendered them neighbors (it presents [the Simeonites’] portion together with their progeny [vv. 28–43]), as it says, “The portion of the Simeonites was part of the territory of the Judahites; because the share of the Judahites was larger than they needed, the Simeonites received a portion inside their portion” (Jos 19:9). For they did not have their own portion as did the other tribes: this is the meaning of “I will scatter them in Jacob” (Gen 49:7).
<b>Nemuel, Jamin.</b> Nemuel is the same as Jemuel mentioned in <i>parashat Vayyiggash</i> (Gen 46:10) and <i>parashat Va’era</i> (Exod 6:15). He is also called Nemuel in <i>parashat Pineḥas</i> (Num 26:12): “Of Nemuel, the clan of the Nemuelites.” One finds this with many Hebrew names—with names of people and of cities—for they were not particular about changing one or two letters in a name. Sometimes, they called people by two names that are <i>not</i> similar to one another—calling them in one place by one name and in another place by another name.

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

<b>In all, their families were not as prolific as the Judahites.</b> Because [the Simeonites] dwelt among the Judahites, the text says that their families were not prolific enough to equal the numbers of the Judahites. It is for this reason that they dwelt among them and were appended to them, living in just a few of the cities of Judah. One even finds the cities mentioned here listed in the book of Joshua among the cities of Judah (Jos 15:20–36). It also mentions these cities as part of the portion of the Simeonites that fell to them within the portion of Judah (Jos 19:1–6). Now it says here “<b>These were their cities until David became king</b>”; for when David became king and the Judahites gained power, the Judahites expelled the Simeonites from their portion. They then sought a portion for themselves, as it says, “They went to the approaches of Gedor, to the eastern side of the valley … and some of the Simeonites went to Mount Seir …” (vv. 39–42); for they went all over looking for a portion. And when it says, “<b>such were their settlements, those to which they were linked (<i>ve-hityaḥsam la-hem</i>)</b>,” it means that those five cities and their villages remained theirs (the Judahites did not expel them from them), so that they were linked to them, meaning that these cities were always referred to by the Simeonites’ name. Linguistically, it is not problematic to employ <i>yḥs</i> for cities. After all, the word <i>yaḥas</i>, as an indication of family, functions mainly to identify the family or tribe from which a person comes. Similarly, then, it can relate cities to people or people to cities, for the purpose of identification and of imparting the relevant information. Accordingly, the <i>yod</i> of צורי (<i>Ṣori</i>; =Tyrian; 1 Kgs 7:14) is called a “<i>yod</i> of <i>yaḥas</i>” because it relates the individual to Tyre, just as the <i>yod</i> of עברי (<i>‘Ivri</i>; =Hebrew; Gen 39:14) is called a “<i>yod</i> of <i>yaḥas</i>” because it relates [the individual] to Eber. Now when the text says “such (<i>zot</i>) were their settlements,” instead of saying <i>elleh</i>, this is consistent with the way the language works in many places, using a plural form for an individual or a singular form for a group: <i>ki tiqrenah milḥamah</i> (=should there be a war; Exod 1:10), <i>vayyavo Mosheh ve-Aharon</i> (=Moses and Aaron came; Exod 7:10), and others like them, as we have written in the <i>Mikhlol</i> in the section on grammar (6b–7a). Alternatively, its meaning is: “This (<i>zot</i>) was the land.”

<b>Meshobab, Jamlech, etc.</b> All those listed were chieftains of clans of the tribe of Simeon and ancestral heads, who went to seek land after David became king.

Verse 41

<b>The Meunim</b>—with a <i>shuruq</i> instead of a <i>ḥolem</i>: it is a plural form of <i>ma‘on</i>, which means a place of residence. When the text says “<b>forever</b>,” this is because until the days of Ezra the descendants of Ham still had not returned to these areas, even though the Simeonites had been exiled from them.

Verse 42

<b>Sons of Ishi were at their head.</b> Our Sages say (b. Bava Batra 123b) that these four sons of Ishi, who were heads of these five hundred people, were from Manasseh; for we have seen that Ishi was from the tribe of Manasseh, as the text says, “These were the chiefs of their clans: Epher, Ishi” (1 Chr 5:24). They say this because they affirmed (b. ibid.) that the descendants of Esau can only be defeated by of the descendants of Joseph—as the text says, “And the House of Esau shall be flame and the House of Esau shall be straw” (Obad 1:18)—and they then asked: But it says, “And some of the Simeonites went to Mount Seir” and “sons of Ishi were at their head”? So they replied that Ishi also came from Manasseh, as it says, “Epher, Ishi.”

Verse 43

<b>[This group of Simeonites] destroyed the last surviving Amalekites.</b> This means whoever remained, not having been wiped out by Saul and David; for concerning David it says, “until he had killed off every male in Edom” (1 Kgs 11:16), and Amalek was a descendant of Edom (Gen 36:9–12). Now when the text says “<b>and [these Simeonites] lived [in Mount Seir] to this day</b>,” it means: until the day that they were exiled. Alternatively, it means that to this day, even though the Simeonites have been exiled from there, Amalekites have not returned there; so to this day it is in the possession of the Simeonites.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<b>The sons of Reuben.</b> After mentioning the Simeonites, who, as we have written, were the Judahites’ neighbors (1 Chr 4:24), the text returns to Reuben, the <b>first-born</b>.
<b>For he was the first-born.</b> This means: He was the first-born, and because the birthright and the kingship should properly have belonged to him, the account of the genealogies should properly have begun with him. But <b>when he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel</b>; that is, his father had a dear and beloved son to whom he gave it.
<b>But not to be reckoned as first-born.</b> This means: When he gave Joseph the birthright, this was not for him to be reckoned as first-born in all respects and to be called Israel’s first-born; for had that been the case he would have had the kingship also, just as the rule would have dictated that Reuben have everything.

Verse 2

<b>For Judah became more powerful than his brothers,</b> and Jacob gave him the kingship, whereas the rest of the birthright—that is, to receive a double portion of land—he gave to Joseph.
<b>And he who was to be a leader (<i>u-le-nagid</i>)<i>—</i>from him (<i>mimmennu</i>).</b> This means: Whoever was to be a leader in Israel (<i>be-Yisra’el le-nagid</i>) Jacob declared must come from him (<i>mimmennu</i>).

Verse 3

<b>The sons of Reuben.</b> Because the text had digressed from the topic, it returns to say “The sons of Reuben” again.

Verse 4

<b>The sons of Joel.</b> Even though the text did not mention him in the genealogical sequence, it mentions him now to provide the lines of the descendants that follow him. There are many cases like this in the genealogical accounts.
<b>His son Shemaiah, his son Gog.</b> Each one is a son of the one before. Even if they all had other sons, the text only mentions the first ones. One finds this in many places.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>His son Beerah, whom [Tillegath (תלגת)-pilneser] exiled. He was chieftain</b> of the tribe of Reuben at the time when Tillegath-pileser exiled them. He is the same as Tiglath (תגלת) mentioned in Kings (2 15:29): the transposition of letters in names is a normal feature of the language, as one sees often.

Verse 7

<b>And his brothers, by their families.</b> This means: He was himself a chieftain, and his brothers, <b>in relation to their lines</b>, were also heads of families and well known; and among them were <b>Jeiel</b>, their<b> head, and Zechariah</b>, etc.

Verse 8

<b>Son of Shema son of Joel.</b> He is the same as Shemaiah son of Joel mentioned above (v. 4).
<b>He dwelt in Aroer (<i>ba-‘Aro‘er</i>) [until Nebo].</b> Some (?) explain that the <i>bet</i> (=in) of <i>ba-‘Aro‘er</i> takes the place of a <i>mem</i> (=from), because Aroer did not belong to the Reubenites, but rather to the Gadites, as the text says, “The Gadites rebuilt Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer” (Num 32:34). And this is correct: we similarly find <i>bet</i> in place of <i>mem</i> in: “and what is left over <i>from</i> the flesh and <i>from</i> the bread (<i>ve-ha-notar ba-basar u-ba-laḥem</i>)” (Lev 8:32), and in: “They battered and shattered the Israelites <i>from</i> that year (<i>ba-shanah ha-hi</i>), for eighteen years” (Judg 10:8). One can also interpret <i>ba-‘Aro‘er</i> to mean in the territory of Aroer (<i>bi-gevul ‘Aro‘er</i>), on the assumption that the city alone belonged to the Gadites who built it, whereas the territory around it belonged to the Reubenites.

Verse 9

<b>He also dwelt toward the east.</b> This means: toward the east of the land of Gilead; for their entire land was east of the land of Israel, as the text says, “the east side of the Jordan” (Num 32:19). They spread out toward the eastern part of the land of Gilead, however, and settled <b>as far as the fringe of the wilderness at the Euphrates River (<i>le-min ha-nahar Perat</i>)</b>, meaning: as far as the Euphrates River, their border extending from the river (<i>min ha-nahar</i>) inward. For the Euphrates River is the eastern boundary of the land of Israel, as the text says, “from the River, the Euphrates (<i>min ha-nahar nehar Perat</i>), until the Western Sea” (Deut 11:24).
<b>Because their cattle had increased.</b> This means: The reason they had to spread out through the land was that their cattle had increased.

Verse 10

<b>With the Hagrites (ההגראים).</b> These are the descendants of Hagar: the <i>alef</i> takes the place of the gentilic <i>yod</i>.
<b>Throughout the entire <i>penei mizraḥ la-Gil‘ad</i>.</b> [This means]: the eastern region (<i>penei mizraḥ</i>) <i>of</i> the Gilead.

Verse 11

<b>The sons of Gad dwelt facing them in the land of Bashan as far as Salcah.</b> This does not include the entire land of Bashan, because the Torah says that Moses gave the land of Bashan to the half-tribe of Manasseh, as it says, “The rest of the Gilead and all of the Bashan the kingdom of Og I assigned to the half-tribe of Manasseh—the whole Argob district, all that part of the Bashan” (Deut 3:13). Rather, the Gadites had a part of the Bashan, which extended until Salcah; and from Salcah onward, the entire Bashan belonged to the half-tribe of Manasseh. And when it says in the Torah that “all of the Bashan [the kingdom of Og]” belonged to the half-tribe of Manasseh, it means: all of the Bashan <i>that constituted</i> the kingdom of Og, along with the whole Argob district that is called “Rephaim country” (ibid.). There were, however, a few places in the Bashan over which Og did not rule. Even though he was called “King of Bashan” (Num 21:33), this is because the majority of the Bashan was his. But a part of the Bashan—until Salcah—had belonged to the Amorites, and that was what the Gadites possessed. When the text says here “and they dwelt in Gilead, in Bashan, and in its dependencies” (v. 16), this refers, again, to the part of the Bashan that extends until Salcah and its dependencies, where the Gadites dwelt. Similarly, when it says here (v. 23) that the half-tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land of Bashan as far as Baal-hermon, it means <i>from the part of the Bashan that belonged to the Gadites</i> as far as Baal-hermon. Accordingly, it says in Joshua (22:7), “To the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had assigned territory <i>in the Bashan</i>,” but it does not say the whole Bashan.

Verse 12

<b>Joel the chief.</b> He was chief of the Gadites. Those four who are mentioned, who were heads of families and well known in the tribe, ruled <b>in the Bashan</b>. But in the Midrash (cf. b. Pesaḥim 68a; Numbers Rabbah 14:18) it says: “‘And Shaphat in Bashan’ refers to Shaphat the father of the prophet Elisha, because the text juxtaposes ‘in Bashan’ to him: just as the Bashan has sixty cities (Deut 3:4), so Elisha his son led Israel for sixty years.”

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Chief of their clan.</b> [This refers] either to Abdiel or to his father Guni.

Verse 16

<b>And they dwelt in Gilead, in the Bashan (<i>ba-Bashan</i>).</b> This means <i>u-ba-Bashan</i> (=<i>and</i> in the Bashan): it elides the <i>vav</i>, as in <i>shemesh yareaḥ</i> (=sun and moon; Hab 3:11).

Verse 17

<b>All of them were registered by genealogies in the days of King Jotham of Judah and in the days of King Jeroboam of Israel.</b> This means: All these descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh were registered by genealogies for this war that they made on the Hagrites (v. 19); that is, they were enumerated by the clans of their ancestral houses when they went out to war. This happened in the days of King Jotham of Judah and in the days of King Jeroboam of Israel—that is, Jeroboam son of Joash, a descendant of Jehu. This is despite the fact that it seems from the verses in Kings that King Jotham of Judah and King Jeroboam of Israel did not rule concurrently. For Jeroboam ruled for forty-one years (2 Kgs 14:23); in Jeroboam’s twenty-seventh year, King Azariah—that is, Uzziah—son of Amaziah ascended to the throne (ibid. 15:1); and this Azariah ruled for fifty-two years (ibid. 15:2). King Azariah of Judah, then, ruled for thirty-eight years after the death of King Jeroboam of Israel. (Even though one can quibble over these calculations, as we will explain [in our commentary] on the book of Kings [ibid. 15:1], Uzziah still lived for a long time after Jeroboam.) How, then, could Jotham son of Uzziah have ruled in the days of Jeroboam? Because Jotham son of Uzziah ruled during the lifetime of his father Uzziah, from the time Uzziah became a leper, as the text says, “The Lord struck the king with a plague … while Jotham, the king’s son, was in charge of the palace and governed the people of the land” (ibid. 15:5). One might also explain “in the days of Jotham … and in the days of Jeroboam” to mean each one in his time, and that [these tribes] registered for the war with each of them.

Verse 18

<b>And experienced at (<i>lemudei</i>) war.</b> This is an adjective derived from the Qal, and not a passive participle; for <i>lmd</i> is an intransitive verb, which takes a <i>pa‘ul</i> form only as an adjective, as I have explained in the <i>Mikhlol</i> in the section on grammar (20a).

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>And all who were with them.</b> [This means]: And all of the nations that were with the Hagrites—all were delivered into the hands [of the Reubenites, Gadites and Manassites].
<i><b>Ve-na‘tor la-hem</i> (=and He responded to their entreaty)<i></b>.</i> This is the equivalent of <i>ve-ne‘tar</i>: it is a passive form, similar to <i>ve-naḥtom be-taba‘at ha-melekh</i> (=and sealed with the king’s signet; Esth 8:8).

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>And [these tribes] dwelt in their stead (<i>taḥtam</i>).</b> [This means]: in their place (<i>bi-meqomam</i>). Even though the text says “They carried off their livestock” (v. 21), some of them dwelt there whereas others returned to their land with the spoils.
<b>Until the exile.</b> [This means]: until they were exiled by the Assyrian king (v. 26).

Verse 23

<b>The members of the half-tribe of Manasseh … they were very numerous.</b> This means: Because they were very numerous, they extended their boundary “to Baal-hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon.”

Verse 24

<i><b>Ve-‘Efer ve-Yish‘i</i> (Epher and Ishi).</b> The <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-‘Efer</i> is like the <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-Ayyah va-‘Anah</i> (=Aiah and Anah; Gen 36:24).

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>To this day.</b> For [these tribes] did not leave when the Judean exile left Babylon.

Verse 27

<b>The sons of Levi.</b> The text presents the progeny of Levi’s sons also—and the cities that were given to them (1 Chr 6:39–66)—and it mentions that David appointed people from their ranks to perform music and to minister before the Lord (ibid. 6:16–38). The text presents the progeny of Aaron until the exile (vv. 29–41); that is, [until] Jehozadak, who went [to Babylon] with the Judean exile at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, and whose son Joshua went up from Babylon with the [returnees from] exile (Hag 1). In the book of Ezra (Ezra 7:1–5), the text [likewise] provides this genealogy back to Aaron, because Ezra was a son of Seraiah: it provides Seraiah’s genealogy back to Aaron, just as here it provides the genealogy of his brother Jehozadak back to Aaron. Only there, it omits five ancestral houses that it mentions here, from Johanan, the father of Azariah, until Meraioth. It is in order to be brief that it omits those five ancestral houses. The text presents the progeny of Eleazar but not the progeny of Ithamar, because high priests were forever to come from the descendants of Eleazar. After all, this is what the Holy One, blessed is He, said to Phinehas when he took impassioned action at Shittim: “It shall be for him and his descendants after him a pact of priesthood for all time” (Num 25:13). And this refers to the high priesthood; for the descendants of Ithamar were also priests, but <i>high</i> priests were forever to come from the descendants of Phinehas. This blessing began with Zadok, because until Zadok there were high priests from the descendants of Ithamar also. After all, Eli was a high priest (cf. 1 Sam 1:9) of the descendants of Ithamar, as were Ahimelech (cf. 1 Sam 21:3) and his son Abiathar (cf. 1 Sam 22:20; 1 Kgs 2:27).

Verse 36

<b>It was [Azariah] who served as priest in the Temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem.</b> If we explain that he was the <i>first</i> to serve as priest in the Temple—such was not the case! For it was Zadok, as it says in Kings, “the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan” (1 Kgs 1:34). In this book also, it says, “and they anointed him as ruler before the Lord, and Zadok as high priest” (1 Chr 29:22). But if we say that the text does not mean that he was the <i>first</i> to serve as priest in the Temple, only that he served in the Temple—there were others who served as priests also; so what is it adding? If it is adding that he was a high priest, there were others who were also high priests! Our Sages, of blessed memory (Yalqut Shimoni <i>Qoraḥ</i> 754), say that this is the Azariah from the days of King Uzziah; and because he gave his life for the sanctity of the Temple in not allowing Uzziah to offer incense (2 Chr 26:17–18), it says “it was he who served as priest,” meaning that he cared about the honor of the priesthood and was not partial to Uzziah. One can also explain that he served as priest in the days of Solomon also—after Zadok, and after his ancestors that are mentioned—but that he was still young in the days of Solomon and was not high priest until the days of Uzziah. In fact, in the days of Hezekiah he was <i>still</i> alive and was high priest, as it says, “The chief priest Uzziah replied to him” (cf. 2 Chr 31:10). So it is because he lived so long that it says concerning him, “who served as priest in the Temple,” meaning: who served for a long period of time.

Chapter 6



Verse 1

<b>The sons of Levi: Gershom.</b> He is the same as Gershon (1 Chr 5:27), because in names, <i>mem</i> and <i>nun</i> are equivalent, as with Chimham (2 Sam 19:38) and Chimhan (ibid. 19:41), and Tannim (Ezek 29:3) and Tannin (Isa 27:1).

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Of Gershom: his son Libni etc.</b> But the text does not present the family of Shimei; and so too in <i>parashat Pineḥas</i> (Num 26:58). The reason it does not mention him here—much as it does not present the families of Amram, Hebron, and Uzziel—is that the ones it does present were the leaders in charge of musical performance, similar to those presented below: from Kohath, the family of Izhar (vv. 18–23); from Gershom, the family of Libni (vv. 24–28); and from Merari, the family of Mushi (vv. 29–32). But when David counts them below, it does present the family of Shimei (1 Chr 23:9–11).
<b>His son Jahath.</b> This is Libni’s son. When the text mentions “Jahath” below among the sons of Shimei (ibid. 23:10), this is because their two sons had the same name. But it mentions below the name of this Jahath, the son of Libni, as “Jehiel” (ibid. 23:7). For “Jahath” and “Jehiel” are phonetically similar, and he was called by both of these names. There are many cases like this in the book.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>The sons of Kohath: Amminadab.</b> The text returns to the descendants of Kohath because it wants to present more of the progeny of his sons and grandsons. Amminadab is the same as Izhar, and he had two names: above (v. 3) it calls him Izhar, and here it calls him Amminadab.
<b>His son Assir, his son Elkanah, his son Ebiasaph.</b> For these three, the text does not mean to say that each was a son of the one before. Rather, these three instances of “his son” refer to Korah, for all three were his sons, as it says in the Torah, “The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph” (Exod 6:24). Here also, when it provides the genealogy of Heman, it says, “Ebiasaph son of Korah” (v. 22).

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>The sons of Elkanah: Amasai and Ahimoth, Elkanah.</b> Each of these three is a son of the one before: Elkanah is Ahimoth’s son, Ahimoth is Amasai’s son, and Amasai is Elkanah’s son.

Verse 11

<b>The sons of Elkanah: his son Zophai, etc.</b> Each of these is a son of the one before. Eliab mentioned here is the same as Elihu mentioned at the beginning of the book of Samuel (1 1:1); Nahath is the same as Tohu mentioned there; and Zophai is the same as Zuph mentioned there.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>The sons of Samuel: the first-born <i>Vashni</i></b> ((וַשְׁנִי<b> and Abijah (<i>va-Aviyyah</i>).</b> Some explain (cf. Pseudo-Rashi) <i>vashni</i> as <i>ve-ha-sheni</i> (=and the second one)—as if the text had said <i>ve-ha-sheni Aviyyah</i> (=and the second one Abijah)—and that it says “the first-born” without mentioning his name because it is known that it is Joel (v. 18), whereas the second is Abijah as it says in Samuel, “and his second son’s name was Abijah” (1 Sam 8:2). They say that שְׁנִי is akin to שֵׁנִי, similar to שְׁלֵו (<i>shelev</i>; =tranquil; Jer 49:31) and שָׁלֵו (<i>shalev</i>; =tranquil; Ezek 23:42), and that the <i>pataḥ</i> under the <i>vav</i> is as in “<i>va-ḥamor</i> and the lion” (1 Kgs 13:28), which is akin to <i>ve-ha-ḥamor</i> (=and the donkey). But this interpretation is not correct, because we never find any case of שְׁנִי that is akin to שֵׁנִי. And there is no proof from שְׁלֵו and שָׁלֵו, because those are two different patterns. Also, there cannot appear a <i>vav</i> with a <i>pataḥ</i> in a case such as this. The <i>vav</i> in <i>va-ḥamor</i> has a <i>pataḥ</i> because of the guttural; for it would otherwise have had a <i>shureq</i>, as does the <i>vav</i> of <i>u-Zevulun</i> (“and Zebulun”; Gen 35:23). Indeed, any conjunctive <i>vav</i> appears as a <i>shureq</i> when juxtaposed to a word that has a <i>sheva</i> at the beginning, unless it is juxtaposed to the letters <i>alef</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, <i>hei</i>, or <i>‘ayin</i>, in which case it is has a <i>pataḥ</i> when the word has a <i>ḥatef pataḥ</i> at the beginning, and a <i>segol</i> when the word has a <i>ḥatef segol</i> at the beginning. So had the <i>vav</i> of <i>vashni</i> been a conjunctive <i>vav</i>, the text should have said <i>u-sheni</i>—the <i>vav</i> with a <i>shuruq</i>. Also, how could the text say “the first-born” without mentioning his name? We never find such an elision! Finally, they would have to say that the <i>vav</i> of <i>va-Aviyyah</i> is extraneous. Who forced them into <i>that</i> predicament? Rather, what is correct is that Vashni is Joel, and that he had two names, as one finds in many places in this book. Thus, this person’s name was Joel, even as his name was also Vashni.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>These were appointed by David <i>‘al yedei shir</i>.</b> This means: He appointed them to perform music.
<i><b>Bet Adonay</i> (=the house of the Lord). </b>This is the equivalent of <i>be-bet Adonay</i> (=<i>in</i> the house of the Lord). The same is true for <i>ha-nimṣa bet Adonay</i> (=found <i>in</i> the House of the Lord; 2 Kgs 12:11) and many others like these.
<i><b>Mi-menoaḥ ha-aron</i> (=from the time the Ark came to rest)<i>.</b></i> This is the construct form of <i>manoaḥ</i>, as <i>meqom</i> (=place of) is of <i>maqom</i> (=place). “From the time the Ark came to rest” means: from the day that the Ark rested in Jerusalem, when they brought it from Kiryath-jearim to Jerusalem (1 Chr 15:16–16:1)—after which it remained in the tent that David pitched for it (2 Sam 6:17) until the construction of the Temple. When the text says “from the time the Ark <i>came to rest</i>,” then, that is the point. For until that day, it had not rested, because they would bring it from place to place. But from the day the Ark rested there, David appointed musicians, and they ministered there before the Ark just as they did in the Temple.

Verse 17

<b>And they performed their service (<i>‘avodatam</i>) as prescribed for them.</b> This means the service of music. It similarly says in the Torah, <i>la‘avod ‘avodat ‘avodah</i> (=to perform duties of service; Num 4:47), which means music—the service that accompanied the sacrifices.

Verse 18

<b>Those were the appointed men.</b> The text mentions these three—Heman, Asaph, and Ethan—who were chiefs of clans of the Levites. For their honor, it provides the genealogy of each of them back to Levi. In fact, in the case of Heman, who was greater and more highly regarded than the other two, it provides the genealogy back to our father Jacob—saying “son of Israel” in connection with him (v. 23)—whereas for the other two it says “son of Levi” (vv. 28, 32) and no more. Indeed, because he was more highly regarded than the others, he would stand in the middle when performing music, with Asaph on his right (v. 24) and Ethan on his left (v. 29). But our Sages explain midrashically (Genesis Rabbah 98:5) that the reason it says “son of Israel” in the genealogy of Heman is that he was a descendant of Korah. For our father Jacob said, “Let not my being be included in <i>their</i> assembly” (Gen 49:6), meaning that my name should not be mentioned in connection with assemblies for which they come together on their own (in the Torah it indeed says, “Korah son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi” [Num 16:1]); but in connection with assemblies for which they are gathered together by David for the service of God, my name should be mentioned. So for this reason, it says “sons of Israel.” In this genealogy of Heman, one finds names that are altered from the form that the text utilized above (vv. 7–13). This [feature] is common; one sees it in many places. Some [individuals] had two names: people would call them by one name on one occasion and by another on another occasion. And some people’s names would change a little bit so that the letters of one [version of the] name are similar to those of the other. They were not particular about this, as with “Toah” mentioned here (v. 19), whom the text earlier calls “Tahath” and in the book of Samuel “Tohu” (1 Sam 1:1). Similarly, here it mentions “Zuph” (v. 20) but above “Zophai” (v. 11). And so for Eliel (v. 19), whom above it calls “Eliab” (v. 12) and in the book of Samuel “Elihu” (1 Sam 1:1).

We have found no reason for this. Ethan (v. 27) is the same as Joah mentioned above (v. 6); Adaiah (v. 26) is the same as Iddo (v. 6); and Ethni (v. 26) is the same as Jeatherai (v. 6).

<b>And their kinsmen the Levites were appointed for all the duties of the Tabernacle of the House of God.</b> That is, those three whom we mentioned were chiefs of clans: they served as musicians before the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and they had to do neither porterage by shoulder nor anything else—they were just musicians. It was their kinsmen who were assigned the rest of the duties of the Tabernacle, as it says in the Torah (Num 1:50, 3:6–8, 4:1–49): they were carriers of the Tabernacle until the Ark came to rest, and from the time the Ark came to rest they served as gatekeepers and involved themselves in the needs of the Tabernacle. They were also gatekeepers in the Temple that Solomon built, as the text says (cf. v. 17).

Verse 34

<b>But Aaron and his sons made offerings.</b> The text mentions Aaron in his capacity as head of the priesthood. This [statement] is connected to the discussion of the Levites. That is, certain duties were assigned to the Levites, and Aaron and his descendants were to make offerings and<b> make atonement for</b> the Israelites.

Verse 35

<b>These are the sons of Aaron.</b> The text presents their lines until Zadok and Ahimaaz (v. 18) who lived in the days of David and Solomon.

Verse 38



Verse 39

<b>These are their dwelling-places according to their settlements.</b> Because the tribe of Levi did not have any part of the land—rather, the Lord is its portion (Jos 13:33)—and they were assigned to the service of God—the Levites to perform music and the priests to make offerings—the text mentions the cities that were given to them in return for their service. In the listing of the cities of the Levites, one finds names that are different from what one finds in the book of Joshua (21:11–38). This is as I have explained to you concerning names of people (v. 18). But some (?) explain that the differences here are due to the following: When the lottery provided for the distribution of the cities enumerated in Joshua, a few of them were in the hands of the Canaanites; so [the Israelites] set aside others instead of them until they conquered them. We find along these lines in the Tosefta (Zuckermandel Makkot 3:2): “Even though they set aside Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, it did not provide refuge; so they set aside Kiryath-jearim instead of it until they conquered Shechem. Even though they set aside Kadesh, it did not provide refuge; so they set aside Gamla instead of it until they conquered Kadesh.” There are many midrashic explanations of the variations in the names, but there is no need to record them.

<b>And from the families of the sons of Kohath.</b> This means: Some of the families of the sons of Kohath—those that did not receive from Judah, Simeon, or Benjamin—received cities from the tribe of Ephraim: <b>Shechem with its pasturelands … and Gezer with its pasturelands.</b>

Verse 52



Verse 53

<b>Jokmeam.</b> This is the same as Kibzaim mentioned in Joshua (21:22).
<b>Beth-horon with its pasturelands.</b> This belonged to the Ephraimites.

Verse 54

<b>Aijalon etc.</b> These belonged to the Danites (Jos 21:24)—but the text does not mention that! Perhaps they were near those cities that [the Danites] received from Ephraim; for in Joshua (21:20–26) it indeed mentions Dan after Ephraim. So it does not mention the name Dan here; for it mentions the cities that were near the cities of the Ephraimites, and it was known that they belonged to the Danites.

Chapter 7



Verse 1

<i><b>Ve-li-benei Yissakhar</i> (=the sons of Issachar).</b> The <i>lamed</i> of <i>ve-li-benei</i> is like the <i>lamed</i> of <i>ve-ha-shelishi le-Avshalom</i> (=the third one Absalom; 1 Chr 3:2). Above (2:3), the text began to present the lines of the tribes; but it interrupted with Levi, presenting their lines and their dwelling-places according to their cities. So now, it returns to provide the lines of the tribes and the numbers that they totaled in the time of King David of Israel. As for those that it leaves out and does not mention here, it mentions them along with all the rest when it relates how they joined David in Hebron in order to coronate him (1 Chr 12:24–39). The text does not, however, provide the lines of Dan and his sons. Some say, though (cf. the commentary attributed to a student of Saadia), that “<i>Ḥushim</i> the sons of <i>aḥer</i>” mentioned near the sons of Naphtali (v. 12) refers to Hushim son of Dan (Gen 46:23). In the case of Naphtali also, it does not provide his progeny beyond his sons (v. 13): perhaps [Ezra] did not find their lines recorded, nor was it told to him by tradition. Alternatively, it includes the genealogies that it left out when it says at the end, “All Israel was registered by genealogies; and these are in the book of the kings of Israel” (1 Chr 9:1).

Verse 2

<i><b>Le-Tola‘</i>  men of substance according to their lines.</b> This means: Tola had (<i>le-Tola‘ hayu</i>) these men of substance by the rest of his sons—other than Uzzi—and they totaled <b>twenty-two thousand six hundred</b>, whereas from Uzzi he had thirty-six thousand (v. 4). This is the reason the text says that they had many wives and sons (v. 4), for that is why their numbers were so high. For the numbers of the rest of Tola’s sons—of whom there were five—totaled just twenty-two thousand six hundred; but the descendants of Uzzi totaled thirty-six thousand, because they had many wives and fathered many sons.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Their kinsmen belonging to all the families of Issachar.</b> [This refers to] those descending from Tola’s brothers—Puah, Jashub, and Shimron.

Verse 6

<b>[The sons of] Benjamin: Bela, Becher, and Jediael—three.</b> Some (?) explain that this Benjamin descends from Issachar, as does the entire line until “the sons of Naphtali” (v. 13), because Benjamin [son of Jacob] will be mentioned later, after Asher (1 Chr 8:1). But it is possible to explain that this refers to Benjamin son of Jacob, and that here the text mentions some of the genealogy, whereas later it mentions more of it—up until the lines of King Saul of Israel.
<b>And Jediael.</b> He is the same as Ashbel (Gen 46:21).

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>The sons of Becher … Anathoth.</b> The city of Anathoth that is in the land of Benjamin is named for him, because this Anathoth built it. This is similar to: “and he named the city for his son Enoch” (Gen 4:17).
<b>And Alemeth (<i>‘Alamet</i>).</b> This too is both a person’s name and the name of a city in the land of Benjamin: it is the one called “Bahurim.” Targum Jonathan, also, renders “from Bahurim” (2 Sam 19:17): “from Alemeth (<i>‘Almat</i>).”

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>And Shuppim and Huppim were the sons of Ir.</b> This is Iri, whom the text lists among the sons of Bela (v. 7).
<b>Hushim,</b> one of<b> the sons of Aher.</b> This Aher is not mentioned—perhaps he is the same as one of those listed, and he had two names. The reason the text relates the genealogy in abridged form is that Ezra recorded only what he found in the genealogical records or was told to him by tradition.

Verse 13

<b>The sons of Naphtali.</b> The text records none of his progeny besides his sons. It says “<b>the descendants of Bilhah</b>” just as the Torah says “These were the descendants of Bilhah” (Gen 46:25); [that is,] without saying the equivalent for the other [mothers of the tribes]. But there is a midrashic interpretation (cf. Bereshit Rabbati 46:25) that the text mentions Bilhah to praise her, because she married Jacob willingly; for concerning her, it does not say “she took” as with Zilpah (Gen 30:9), but only “she gave” (Gen 30:4).

Verse 14

<b>The sons of Manasseh: Asriel (<i>Asri’el</i>), whom she bore.</b> It seems from the Torah (Num 26:29–31) that Asriel is a son of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh, so that he was [Manasseh’s] great-grandson. We find many places in this book where the text lists grandsons in a sequence of sons. So here, too, it mentions Asriel among the sons of Manasseh even though he was his great-grandson. And it places him before his son Machir because Machir was a son of a concubine, as it says, “<b>his Aramean concubine bore Machir the father of Gilead</b>.” When it says “Asriel, whom she bore” without mentioning the one who bore him, it follows a standard practice of the text, as in: “whom she bore to Levi in Egypt” (Num 26:59), and: “He was the one whom she bore after Absalom” (1 Kgs 1:6). The reason the text mentions Asriel without listing the others is that they are [all] listed in the Torah (Num 26:29–35); so it takes an abridged form. But it does mention Asriel: perhaps he was more highly regarded than his brothers and his family was well known. There is a midrashic explanation on this (?), [which affirms that it mentions him] because his name was similar to their ancestor <i>Yisra’el</i> (=Israel).

Verse 15

<b>And Machir took a wife <i>le-Ḥuppim u-le-Shuppim.</i></b> This means: He took a wife <i>from</i> [Huppim and Shuppim]. These are the sons of Ir mentioned above (v. 12). The meaning of the <i>lamed</i>s in <i>le-Ḥuppim u-le-Shuppim</i> is that Machir took a wife who was a sister of Huppim and Shuppim (<i>aḥot le-Ḥuppim u-le-Shuppim</i>). Thus it says, “<b>The name of his sister was Maacah.</b>” In saying “his sister” rather than “their sister,” the text is referring to the more highly regarded of them, namely Huppim, whom it places before Shuppim. But when it says “Shuppim and Huppim” (v. 12), this is according to birth.
<b>And the name of the second was Zelophehad.</b> This connects to “The sons of Manasseh: Asriel” above (v. 14): Asriel is a great-grandson of Manasseh—three generations after him—whereas Zelophehad is a great-great-grandson of Manasseh—four generations after him. The text says “the second” even though, relative to Asriel, [the line that produced Zelophehad] did not come second—for [Zelophehad’s] father Hepher was Gilead’s sixth son, whereas Asriel was the third (Num 26:29–33). Rather, it means “the second” one <i>mentioned</i>, for it only mentions Asriel, Zelophehad, and the sons of Shemida mentioned at the end (v. 19). The text mentions [Zelophehad] instead of his father Hepher, because Zelophehad was the only son he had who was as honorable and highly regarded as he was, and it was [Zelophehad] who perpetuated his name; for the others are not mentioned. But while <b>Zelophehad had daughters</b> only, Hepher did have other sons, as it says in Joshua, “a portion among their father’s brothers” (Jos 17:4), and in the Torah, “wives for the sons of their uncles” (Num 36:11).

Verse 16

<b>And his sons were Ulam and Rekem.</b> This refers to Peresh, or to the closer Sheresh.

Verse 17

<b>These were the sons of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh.</b> This refers to Asriel and Zelophehad whom the author had mentioned (vv. 14–15). He is saying: Even though I listed them among the sons of Manasseh, they were descendants of his grandson Gilead.

Verse 18

<b>And his sister the ruler.</b> [This means]: the sister of Gilead. She ruled over part of Gilead’s land. Even though this is not mentioned in the Torah or in the Prophets, it was known to them by tradition. And because she was a great woman, the text provides her progeny.

Verse 19

<b>The sons of Shemida were.</b> The text did not have to mention that Shemida was a son of Gilead, because this is known from the Torah (Num 26:32); but it mentions his sons, who were <b>Ahian, Shechem, Likhi, and Aniam</b>. This Shechem is not the one mentioned in the Torah (Num 26:31), for that one was Shemida’s brother, whereas this was his son.

Verse 20

<b>The sons of Ephraim: Shuthelah—</b>as stated in the Torah (Num 26:35). Bered is the same as Becher mentioned in the Torah (ibid.); <b>Tahath</b> is the same as Tahan (ibid.); and from that point forward they are later descendants. It is possible, however, that with the exception of Shuthelah, <i>all</i> those mentioned are later descendants.

Verse 21

<b>The men of Gath killed them, the ones born in the land.</b> Some explain (Pseudo-Rashi) that the reason the text says “the ones born in the land” is that <i>the men of Gath</i> were born in the land, and knew the lay of the land; so when the Ephraimites came into the land <b>to take their cattle</b> and did not know the roads, the men of Gath ambushed them and killed them. And some (?) explain that it says “the ones born in the land” because Gath later belonged to Israel; so it says that the men of Gath who were <i>born</i> in the land, that is, the Philistines, were the ones who killed them. But in my opinion, “the ones born in the land” refers to the Ephraimites. Because among the descendants of Ephraim the text mentions the ones born in Egypt—that is, his sons and grandsons, as it says, “Joseph lived to see children of the third generation of Ephraim” (Gen 50:23)—it says that the descendants of Ephraim “born in the land”—whom <i>he produced</i> “in the land”—went down to the land of Gath to take their cattle, and the men of Gath killed them. Now this took place in the wilderness. It could not have taken place in the land of Israel, because the text says “And Ephraim their father mourned many days” (v. 22)—and Ephraim did not enter the land! For the only ones who left Egypt at twenty years of age or more who entered were Joshua and Caleb (Num 14:29–30). Therefore, I say that this event took place in the wilderness or in the land of Gilead, with Ephraim still alive. For that <i>is</i> possible, because Machir son of Manasseh was among those who conquered the land of Gilead (Jos 17:1), and the children of Machir son of Manasseh were, after all, “born upon Joseph’s knees” (Gen 50:23). What proves this interpretation is that you find that the Ephraimites’ numbers when they went out of Egypt, when they were counted in the wilderness of Sinai in the second year, totaled forty thousand five hundred (Num 1:33), whereas when they were counted upon entering the land, at the fords of Moab, they totaled only thirty-two thousand five hundred (Num 26:37). So those eight thousand whom they lost in the wilderness are the ones whom the Gathites killed. But our Sages, of blessed memory, explain midrashically (b. Sanhedrin 92b) that this was before the exodus from Egypt: having calculated the end erroneously, they left before their time, and this is what happened to them.

Verse 22

<b>And <i>eḥav</i> came to comfort [Ephraim].</b> This means his relatives and the people who knew him.

Verse 23

<b>Because [this wife] was in his house when there was misfortune.</b> For it was after he took her that this tragic event occurred, in which the men of Gath killed his sons.

Verse 24

<b>Who built both Lower and Upper Beth-horon.</b> These are the ones mentioned in the book of Joshua, in the portion of the Ephraimites (Jos 16:3, 5).
<b>And Uzzen of Sheerah.</b> The name of the city is Uzzen. Perhaps there was another Uzzen; so they would attribute this one to Sheerah, who built it.

Verse 25

<b>His son Rephah, Resheph.</b> The text returns to the genealogical sequence that it initiated for the Ephraimites (vv. 20–21). It digressed with the story of the men of Gath, and now it returns and completes the genealogy up until Joshua.

Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<i><b>Ve-‘al yedei</i> the Manassites. </b>[This means]: <i>ve-‘al meqomot</i> (=and near the places of) the Manassites, as in <i>ish ‘al yado</i> (=each man in his place; Num 2:17). It means to say that near the cities of the Manassites, which were <b>Beth-shean and its dependencies, Taanach and its dependencies</b>, etc., were the cities of Ephraim, as it says in the book of Joshua (17:8–11).

Verse 30

<b>The sons of Asher … who was the father of Birzaith.</b> Malchiel was the father of Birzaith.

Verse 31



Verse 32

<b>Heber begot Japhlet … heads of (<i>rashei</i>) the chieftains.</b> Their might was so great that they were heads even of the chieftains of the tribes. Alternatively, <i>rashei</i> is the equivalent of <i>rashim</i> (=heads)—there are many cases like this—and the text means to say: they were the heads, the chieftains.

Chapter 8



Verse 1

<b>Benjamin begot Bela his first-born, Ashbel the second.</b> The text says “Ashbel the second” when he was really the third; for the sons of Benjamin were Bela, Becher, and Ashbel (Gen 46:21). Indeed, above it does say “Bela, Becher” (7:6). But because it does not mention Becher [here], it says “Ashbel the second.” It does not mention Becher here much as it does not mention him in <i>parashat Pineḥas</i>—just: “Of Bela, the clan of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the clan of the Ashbelites” (Num 26:38). Now in <i>parashat Vayyiggash</i> (Gen 46:21) the text lists ten sons for Benjamin, whereas in <i>Pineḥas</i> (Numbers 26:38–39) it only lists five! Perhaps these five were the clan chiefs for Benjamin. That would also be why it does not list Becher here even though it lists him in the first account. Also, in <i>Vayyiggash</i> (Gen 46:21) the text lists Ard and Naaman among the sons of Benjamin, whereas in <i>Pineḥas</i> (Numbers 26:40) it lists them among the sons of Bela! Perhaps in <i>Vayyiggash</i> it includes grandsons with sons. Alternatively, it says “The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman” because Bela named his sons for his brothers. In <i>Pineḥas</i>, the text also presents the names differently from the way it presents them in <i>Vayyiggash</i>, as this book does [here] and in many places besides it, as we have written (1 Chr 6:18). But our Sages, of blessed memory (Numbers Rabbah 21:8), say that those families missing in <i>Pineḥas</i> perished in the wilderness in the affair of Balaam. What will they say, though, concerning Becher, who is not mentioned in <i>Pineḥas</i> but is mentioned above in this book (7:8–9)—himself, his family, and the numbers they reached in the time of David?

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>And they transferred them (<i>vayyaglum</i>) to Manahath.</b> This means: These clan chiefs transferred the inhabitants of Geba to Manahath; and after that, the text mentions which of the heads transferred them, namely Naaman, Ahijah, and Gera. The sense of this usage of <i>glh</i> is one of movement; that is, he made them get up and move from their place, which was Geba, to Manahath. The sense of “You are also a <i>goleh</i> (=an exile)” (2 Sam 15:19) is also one of movement. It is the same for every use of <i>glh</i>, except that most of them refer to moving captives.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>And Shaharaim had sons in the country of Moab <i>min</i> (=from) <i>Shilḥo Otam</i>.</b> This Shaharaim is a descendant of Benjamin—even though the text does not mention him, there are many such cases in the book—who went to live in the country of Moab because of famine or some other occurrence and had sons from Shilho Otam. That is the name of one of his wives; <b>Hushim</b> is [the name of] the second; and <b>Baara</b> is [the name of] the third—all three were his wives. The text is saying that he had sons by all three: [the word] “from” in “from Shilho” serves a double function, so that it is as though it had said: “from Shilho Otam and from Hushim”; and <i><b>ve-et</i> Baara</b> is equivalent to “<i>u-min</i> (=and from) Baara,” as in “they had just gone out <i>et</i> the city” (Gen 44:4) and “as I go out <i>et</i> the city” (Exod 9:29), where [<i>et</i>] means <i>min</i>. The text provides the lines of two of his wives (vv. 9–11)—“his wife Hodesh” (v. 9) is the same as Shilho Otam whom it mentioned—but it does not provide the lines of Baara. Perhaps this is because [Baara’s descendants] were not highly regarded or in positions of leadership; for the ones that it does mention were clan chiefs, as it says (v. 28). But some (?) explain <i>min shilḥo otam</i> to mean: After (<i>me-‘et</i>; =<i>min ‘et</i>; =from the time) Shaharaim sent them away (<i>shilaḥ otam</i>), transferring them and the rest of the clan chiefs to Manahath (vv. 6–7), he subsequently went to the country of Moab and had sons there by his wives Hushim and Baara.

<b>Jaareshiah, Elijah, and Zichri were the sons of Jeroham.</b> I found in the Midrash (Exodus Rabbah 40:4) that this Elijah is the prophet Elijah, and that he had four names; and these four names are interpreted as references to him, as expounded in that midrashic passage. He was a Benjaminite, then—for as the text says (v. 1), these are the lines of Benjamin—in which case Phinehas is not the same as Elijah according to this midrashic author. I also found in Seder Eliyyahu Rabbah (18) and in Genesis Rabbah (71:9): “[Elijah] said to them: ‘My distinguished scholars, how much longer are you going to debate over me? I am a descendant of <i>Rachel</i>!’ They said to him: ‘Provide evidence for your claim.’ He said to them: ‘Is this not what it says in the book of genealogies: “Elijah and Zichri were the sons of Jeroham”?’”

Verse 28

<b>These dwelt in Jerusalem.</b> For part of Jerusalem belonged to Benjamin and part of it to Judah, and the Benjaminites mentioned to this point dwelt in Jerusalem.

Verse 29

<b>Dwelt in Gibeon (<i>Giv‘on</i>).</b> Gibeon was a Benjaminite city, as it says in the book of Joshua (18:25). Perhaps this <i><b>Avi Giv‘on</b></i> built it, and it was named for him. Alternatively, his real name was Jeiel—mentioned below where the text provides this genealogy a second time (1 Chr 9:35)—but it calls him <i>Avi Giv‘on</i> (=father of Gibeon) because he was the elder of the city called <i>Giv‘on</i>.

Verse 30

<b>Baal, Nadab.</b> The text does not mention Ner; but the second time it does mention him: “Baal, Ner, Nadab” (1 Chr 9:36).

Verse 31



Verse 32

<b>They, too, opposite their kinsmen.</b> They too <b>dwelt with their kinsmen</b> in Jerusalem, even though their primary residence was not in Jerusalem.

Verse 33

<b>Ner begot Kish.</b> In the book of Samuel it says that Abiel was the father of Kish (1 Sam 9:1), and that Ner was a brother of Kish son of Abiel and the father of Abner (ibid. 14:51). In another verse also, it says “Abiner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle” (ibid. 14:50). But here it says that Ner was the father of Kish the father of Saul! (Also, in the verse below it says “Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab” [1 Chr 9:36], from which it seems that Ner and Kish were brothers. Concerning that, however, we might explain that Ner named his son Kish, for his brother.) It is possible to explain that Abiel is the same as Ner and that he had two names, and that his son—who was the father of Abner—he named Ner, for himself. So when Ner named his son Abner (<i>Avner</i>), he meant to refer to the name of his father (<i>av</i>), which was Ner. I similarly found the following in a rabbinic source, in Leviticus Rabbah (9:2): “Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish said: One verse says ‘Ner begot Kish,’ and another verse says ‘Kish son of Abiel’ (1 Sam 9:1). How can this be? His name was Abiel, but because he would light candles (<i>nerot</i>) for the public in dark alleys he acquired the name Ner.”
<b>Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.</b> Abinadab is the same as Ishvi mentioned in the book of Samuel (1 14:49): the text calls him Abinadab there also when they died at war (1 Sam 31:2). Eshbaal is the same as Ish-bosheth (<i>Ish Boshet</i>) son of Saul (2 Sam 2:8): “baal” and “bosheth” are the same, because the Baal-deity is called <i>Boshet</i> (=shame), as it says, “They turned aside to <i>Boshet</i>” (Hos 9:10). It also says, “you have set up altars to <i>Boshet</i>, altars for sacrifice to Baal” (Jer 11:13). Furthermore, Gideon is called both Jerubbaal (Judg 6:32) and Jerubbesheth (2 Sam 11:21). (The text, however, does not tell us why he was called that.) The same is true for Jonathan’s son: in the book of Samuel it calls him Mephibosheth (2 4:4), and here “Merib-baal” (v. 34). “Baal” stands in place of “bosheth”; and “Merib (<i>meriv</i>)” stands in place of “Mephi (<i>mefi</i> [מפי])” because they are similar, for a <i>merivah</i> (=quarrel) is <i>‘al ha-peh</i> (על הפה; [=oral]). This is what they were called because of some matter known to them that it not known to us.

Verse 34

<b>Merib-baal begot Micah.</b> In the book of Samuel (2 9:12) it says that this Micah was a son of Mephibosheth.

Chapter 9



Verse 1


<b>All Israel was registered by genealogies.</b> This means: Even though I have provided some of the genealogies, I have not provided all of them: <b>the book of the kings of Israel is where they are recorded.</b> But that book, like the Book of Jashar (Jos 10:13) and the Book of the Wars of the Lord (Num 21:14), is not in our possession.

Verse 2

<b>And Judah was taken into exile in Babylon because of its violations.</b> Concerning the exile of Israel, the text stated above (5:26) that King Pul of Assyria and King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria exiled the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. In fact, the Assyrian king exiled the rest of the tribes also (2 Kgs 17). None of these tribes, however, returned at the time of the Second Temple, with the exception of a small minority—from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun (cf. 2 Ch 30:18)—who remained with the Judean kings until the Judean exile, went to exile with them, and returned with them. The tribe of Judah, on the other hand, which was taken into exile in Babylon because of its transgressions, did return in the time of Ezra. So here it tells about their return, and about those who settled in Jerusalem upon their return from exile as described in the book of Ezra (Neh 11:4–6). When the text says “<b>The first to settle on their property</b>,” it means that the first returnees from Babylon settled on their property <b>in their cities</b>—<b>Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants</b>. And as it proceeds to detail, some of them settled in Jerusalem. It says the same thing in the book of Ezra (Neh 11:3): “These are the provincial heads who lived in Jerusalem. In the countryside of Judah, the people lived in their towns, each on his own property—Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants.” Only there it adds “and the sons of Solomon’s servants,” who are not mentioned here.

Verse 3

<b>And among those who settled in Jerusalem were some of the Judahites etc.</b> The text there says the same thing (Neh 11:4). The account here parallels the one there, with only occasional discrepancies. And those are easy to harmonize, because people are called by different names, as we have stated several times [in commenting] on this book. While [the two accounts] provide different numbers for the Benjaminites and the priests, this is because it counts some there that it does not count here, and vice versa. It is readily understandable.

<b>Shallum son of Kore son of Ebiasaph son of Korah.</b> This is the same Ebiasaph son of Korah mentioned above (6:22) in the section that begins, “These were appointed by David to be in charge of music” (6:16). Shallum son of Kore is not mentioned there, however. Perhaps he was a descendant of Heman, and the text elides the genealogy through the son of Ebiasaph son of Korah.
<b>And his kinsmen of his clan, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, guards of the threshold of the Tent.</b> This means they were guards of the doorposts of the Holy of Holies, much as their ancestors of the Korahite family—that is, the Kohathite family—were responsible for the Ark, the cover, and the screening curtain (cf. Num 4:4–15). This, then, is <b>the camp of the Lord</b>. They would guard the entrance so that nobody would go inside, much as it says concerning themselves, “But let them not go inside and witness the dismantling of the Sanctuary” (Num 4:20).

Verse 20

<b>And Phinehas son of Eleazar was the chief officer over them in time past; the Lord was with him.</b> This means: Phinehas son of Eleazar was chief officer over the Korahite family in time past, in the days of their ancestors, just as his father Eleazar was in charge of them, as the text says, “In charge of the duties … Eleazar son of Aaron the priest” (cf. Num 3:32; 4:16). Eleazar’s son Phinehas continued to be chief after him: because the Lord was with Phinehas and he was greater than the sons of Ithamar, he was chief over them his whole life. Some of our Sages, of blessed memory (Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer 47), say that Phinehas is the same as Elijah. And it is indeed true that Phinehas lived for a long time. For he was among those who left Egypt (Exod 6:25); and in the days of the concubine at Gibeah, more than three hundred years after the exodus from Egypt, we see that he was still alive, as the text says there, “and Phinehas son of Eleazar …” (Judg 20:28). In a midrashic vein, our Sages, of blessed memory (Genesis Rabbah 60:3), say that the Divine Presence left him because he did not annul Jephtah’s vow, and that this is why the text says “was the chief officer over them”—not “<i>is</i> … over them,” but “<i>was</i> … over them.” And concerning [the phrase], “in time past the Lord was with him,” they say (y. Yoma 5a): “‘In time past the Lord was with him,’ for in the days of Zimri he protested (Num 25:7–8), whereas in the days of the concubine at Gibeah (Judg 19–21) he did not protest.” That is, because in the days of Zimri the Lord was with him, he had the strength to protest; so he did so. In fact, because the Lord was with him and he had the strength to protest, there was atonement for Israel in they did not die out in the days of Zimri. But in the days of the concubine at Gibeah he did not have the strength to protest, because the Lord was not with him; for several thousand Israelites had died by the time they defeated the Benjaminites (Judg 20:21–39). But some (?) explain that [the statement] “And Phinehas son of Eleazar was the chief officer over them” does not refer to Phinehas the priest, because this Phinehas was a Levite; and that is [precisely] the meaning of “in time past the Lord was with him.” That is, this Phinehas is <i>not</i> the one from time past, because the Lord was with <i>that</i> Phinehas in that the Divine Spirit rested on him. But such was not the case for this one, even though he was great and was chief officer over the Levites. The correct interpretation, however, is the one I have provided.

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>All these who were selected … David and Samuel the seer established them when they set things in place (<i>be-emunatam</i>).</b> David and Samuel instituted shifts of priests and Levites and established that [together, the gatekeepers at the thresholds] should not amount to fewer than two hundred and twelve [Levites]. The sense of <i>be-emunatam</i> is <i>be-qiyyumam</i> (=when they set things in place), meaning that they established this and set it in place, as in: “And Esther’s ordinance set in place (<i>qiyyam</i>)” (Esth 9:32). What the text is saying here, then, is that they established the matter, and they set in place that it be like this for all times. Many cases can be found where <i>emunah</i> has the sense of <i>qiyyum</i>, such as “And I will espouse you with <i>emunah</i> (=permanence)” (Hos 2:22), <i>emunah omen</i> (=have been steadfastly fulfilled; Isa 25:1), “<i>emunat ‘ittekha</i> (=your capacity to endure) shall be” (Isa 33:6), and others besides these. But our Sages, of blessed memory (y. Sukkah 26b), concerning <i>be-emunatam</i>, say that there was an expertly devised system (<i>umanut gedolah</i>) in place there, which assured that no one shift would preemptively receive a second opportunity for appropriating land-holdings. Now these two hundred and twelve did not all serve guard-duty at once. Rather, consistent with the schedule of the shifts, a new shift would come every seven days. This is what is meant by: “to come every seven days, according to a fixed schedule, as did these (‘<i>im elleh</i>)” (v. 25). For these [Levite gatekeepers] too lived in villages of their own, as the text says, “they were in villages that accorded with their genealogy.” This means the villages given to them in the days of Joshua: each of them would trace his lineage to his ancestral house to find out in which city his ancestors lived. They knew, however, to come to Jerusalem for the shifts that were assigned to them.

Verse 31

<b>Were entrusted with <i>ma‘aseh ha-ḥavittim</i> (החבתים).</b> [This means]: <i>ma‘aseh maḥavat</i> (=making the griddle cakes). The gemination [of the <i>tav</i>] takes the place of the vowel-letter exemplified in [the word] <i>seridim</i> (שרידים; =fugitives; Jos 10:20), which represents its pattern. The same is true in [the phrase], “for the Arameans are <i>neḥittim</i> (נחתים; =encamped) there” (2 Kgs 6:9): the root is <i>nḥt</i>, and the gemination [of the <i>tav</i>] takes the place of the vowel-letter exemplified in <i>seridim</i>.

Verse 35

<b>And in Gibeon there lived, etc.</b> The text presented this section above (8:29), but it interrupted with the matter of the Levites and priests who lived in Jerusalem during their shifts. So now it presents it again, for the purpose of recording the progeny of Saul in proper sequence and an account of his fate and of the transferring of the kingship from him to David son of Jesse. From that point onward, it proceeds to relate the history of the Judean kings in order, one after the other, until the exile.

<b>And they carried off his head and his armor … and they impaled his head in the temple of Dagon.</b> But in the book of Samuel [it says], “and they impaled his body on the wall of Beth-shan” (1 Sam 31:10)! What is omitted there is filled in here; for they impaled his head in the temple of Dagon and his and his sons’ bodies on the wall of Beth-shan, and the people of Jabesh-gilead then took his and his sons’ bodies.  They did not, however, take his head from the temple of Dagon. The reason the people of Jabesh-gilead took care of him is that they remembered what he did for them: he saved them when Nahash the Ammonite threatened them (1 Sam 11:1–11).

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>And [the people of Jabesh-gilead] fasted for seven days.</b> This was in remembrance of the seven-day respite granted to them by Nahash the Ammonite (1 Sam 11:3), because it was during that time that they had been saved by Saul.

Verse 13

<b>For not having fulfilled the command of (<i>devar</i>) the Lord.</b> This refers to the matter of (<i>devar</i>) Amalek (1 Sam 15:8–9).

Verse 14

<b>And did not seek the advice of the Lord.</b> But in the book of Samuel it says, “And Saul inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him” (1 Sam 28:6), and that he sought the advice of the ghost only subsequently! Because he did subsequently seek the advice of the ghost, it was considered as if he had not sought the advice of the Lord—for he equated one inquiry with the other. Even though the Lord did not answer him, he should have reached out to the Lord again and repented fully before Him, rather than compounding his sinful behavior with the transgression of seeking the advice of the ghost.

<b>From the <i>millo</i> until the <i>saviv</i>.</b> A <i>millo</i> is an area near the wall of a city; it is a plaza where the people assemble. That is why it is called a <i>millo</i>, as in <i>he’asefu mal’u</i> (=come together, assemble; cf. Jer 4:5). He built from there inward, until the area surrounding (<i>seviv</i>) the tower: that is the meaning of “until the <i>seviv</i>.” That is also the meaning of “from the <i>millo va-baytah</i> (toward the house)” in the book of Samuel (2 Sam 5:9); that is, from the <i>millo</i> inward. Solomon built upon this <i>millo</i>, as it says, “Solomon built upon the <i>millo</i>” (1 Kgs 11:27).
<b>And Joab revived the rest of the city.</b> This means: He built the rest of the city, which was demolished. The use of “reviving” for building is a metaphor. The same is true for: “Can they revive those stones out of the dust heap?” (Neh 3:34). “He healed the damaged altar of the Lord” (1 Kgs 18:30) is similarly a metaphor.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>Jashobeam (<i>Yashov‘am</i>) son of Hachmoni. </b>But in the book of Samuel [it says], “<i>yoshev ba-shevet</i> Tahchemoni” (2 Sam 23:8)! Perhaps his father’s name was Tahchemoni, akin to the phrase here “son of Hachmoni,” whereas his name was Adino (ibid.); and he used to sit in session (<i>yoshev ba-shevet</i>) with the king, for he was among his advisors. This, then, is why he was called<i> Yashov‘am</i>; for he would sit (<i>yoshev</i>) on the king’s advisory panel opposite the people (‘<i>am</i>) or on matters concerning the people. And when the text there says “against eight hundred” and here <b>against three hundred</b>, one refers to the father and the other to the son. Alternatively, they might both refer to one of them, but to two different wars: in one he wielded his spear against three hundred, and in the other against eight hundred.

Verse 12

<b>He was one of the three war-heroes.</b> The three war-heroes were the son of Hachmoni, Eleazar son of Dodo, and Shammah son of Age (2 Samuel 23:11). Even though the text does not mention Eleazar’s heroic deed here, it does mention it in Samuel: “He struck down Philistines until his arm grew tired” (2 Sam 23:10). But when it says here, “He was with David at Pas Dammim” (v.13), it does not refer to Eleazar, but rather to Shammah; for it says in Samuel with respect to Shammah, “He took his stand in the middle of the plot and defended it” (2 Sam 23:12). Even though it says “he” without mentioning Shammah, it is as though it had mentioned him; for it refers to the three war-heroes, and Shammah was the third. It might be, though, that Eleazar was with him; for it says here, “<i>they</i> took <i>their</i> stand in the middle of the plot” (v. 14). Still, Shammah was the main one in that war, as it says in the book of Samuel (ibid. v. 11–12).

Verse 13

<b>At Pas (פס) Dammim.</b> In the book of Samuel, concerning the war of Goliath the Philistine, it says “at Ephes (אפס) Dammim” (1 Sam 17:1), which is the same place where this war was. Concerning this war, it says in Samuel “And the Philistines had gathered to the <i>ḥayyah</i>” (2 Sam 23:11), which means an open city, one without a wall. That was the place called Ephes Dammim—or Pas Dammim, for they are one and the same.
<b>There was a plot of ground full of barley there.</b> But in the book of Samuel [it says], “full of lentils” (ibid.)! Perhaps the plot was filled with bundles because it had already been harvested, and they had gathered into it bundles from other fields also. The bundles thus consisted of both lentils and barley, and it was filled with them. So the text here says “full of barley,” and there “full of lentils.”

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Three of the thirty chiefs went down.</b> [This means]: of the thirty who were David’s chief warriors.
<b>To the rock.</b> The text says “they went <i>down</i> … to the rock” because the place where they had been, from which they went down, was higher than this rock that was at <b>the cave of Adullam</b>. The same is true for: “I will go down upon the hills” (Judg 11:37), and for: “and he went down to the rock” (1 Sam 23:25).

Verse 21

<b>Among the three, [Abshai] was more highly regarded than the other two (<i>ba-shenayim nikhbad</i>).</b> For he was among the three warriors who brought water, and he was more highly regarded than his two colleagues: this is the meaning of <i>ba-shenayim nikhbad</i>. When it says in the book of Samuel, “he was the most highly regarded among the three” (2 Sam 23:19), it is also referring to those three.
<b>But he did not attain to the three.</b> [This means]: to those other three: Tahchemoni, Eleazar, and Shammah.

Verse 22

<b>The two <i>ari’el Mo’av</i>.</b> [This means]: the two <i>gibborei Mo’av</i> (=Moabite warriors). The Targum on the book of Samuel (ibid. v. 20) similarly renders: “the two Moabite chiefs (<i>ravrevei Mo’av</i>).” The text refers to warriors as <i>ari’el</i> because the lion (<i>ari</i>) is strong and powerful, and the sense of <i>el</i> is also strength.

Verse 23

<b>A man of dimensions (<i>ish middah</i>).</b> In the book of Samuel (ibid. v. 21) [it says], “a man to behold (<i>ish mar’eh</i>),” meaning he had both a huge face and enormous dimensions.
<b>Like a weaver’s beam.</b> This is the piece of wood that a weaver uses for folding a garment.

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>[Benaiah] was more highly regarded than the thirty.</b> He was not among the thirty but was even more highly regarded than they were.

Verse 29

<b>And Zadok, a young man.</b> At the time he was still a young man. He was <b>valiant</b>, and he joined David together with <b>twenty-two</b> officers from his clan.

Verse 30

<b>Until that point, many of them.</b> This means that these three thousand Benjaminties joined David in Hebron after the deaths of Abner and Ish-bosheth, when all of Israel joined David in Hebron (2 Sam 5:1). It was only then that these three thousand came; for until that point, “many of them” were with the House of Saul protecting his kingship, unlike those who joined David in Ziklag during Saul’s lifetime (1 Chr 12:1–2).

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b>Of the Issacharites, men who possessed the wisdom of times (‘<i>ittim</i>), to determine how Israel should act.</b> Our Sages, of blessed memory (cf. Genesis Rabbah 72:5; b. Megillah 12b), explain that they knew how to calculate leap years and to determine the beginnings of months. This explains why it says “to determine how Israel should act” and “who possessed the wisdom of times”—that is, of seasons—for they knew how to make calculations based on celestial cycles and constellations. The text mentions this matter here because the king needed to consult with them on [these issues]; for the declaration of leap years and [of new months] was done by royal decree, as is apparent in the case of King Hezekiah (b. Sanhedrin 12a). But R. Jonah [ibn Janaḥ] (<i>Shorashim</i> entry <b>עות</b>) explains [‘<i>ittim</i> (עתים)] in the sense of “laws”; for the king needed to consult with them on legal matters. The same is true for “learned in <i>‘ittim</i>” (Esth 1:13)—as the text elaborates: “before all who were versed in law and precedent” (ibid.)—and for “the heart of a wise man knows ‘<i>et</i> (עת) and law” (Eccl 8:5). But according to this interpretation, [the phrase] “to determine how Israel should act” does not fit; for the text should have said, “to determine how <i>the king</i> should act.” However, according to the interpretation of our Sages, of blessed memory, [the phrase] “to determine how Israel should act”—meaning how to observe the holidays in their proper time—is entirely suitable.

Verse 34

<b>Of Zebulun … <i>ve-la‘ador be-lo lev va-lev</i>.</b> <i>Ve-la‘ador</i> means <i>ve-la‘arokh</i> (=and to carry out in an ordered fashion), as in <i>‘oderei ma‘arakhah</i> (=men who manned the battle lines; v. 39). Similarly, “and <i>‘adarim</i> for the troughs” (2 Chr 32:28) means orderly storage places. This is why a flock (<i>ma‘arekhet</i>) of sheep is called an ‘<i>eder</i>. The meaning of the verse, then, is that these men would carry out battles against the enemies of David <i>be-lo lev va-lev</i> (=without being of one heart [on the one hand] and of another heart [on the other]); that is, they were not of two hearts, but of one heart in full solidarity with David. But in Genesis Rabbah (cf. Leviticus Rabbah 25:2) [it says]: “<i>Be-lo lev va-lev</i> (=without heart or with heart): they would win whether or not they put their minds to it.”

<b>Likewise, all <i>sherit</i> (=the rest of) Israel.</b> This is equivalent to <i>she’erit</i>. Similarly, “shall grant you <i>shelatekh</i> (=your request)” (1 Sam 1:17) is equivalent to <i>she’elatekh</i>.

Chapter 13



Verse 1

<b>To every officer.</b> This means: [David] <i>called</i> to every officer to consult with him.

Verse 2

<i><b>Nifreṣah nishleḥah</i> (=let us send far and wide) to our kinsmen.</b> This means: Let us send messengers in all directions, to every place, as in “<i>u-paraṣta</i> (=you shall spread out) to the west and to the east” (Gen 28:14): [the root <i>prṣ</i>] always has the sense of something spreading far. This is what the text means when it says in the book of Samuel, “David again assembled” (2 Sam 6:1); that is, just as it says here, he gathered additional Israelites, beyond those who had been with him when he became king.

Verse 3

<b>For during the days of Saul we did not seek Him.</b> For he wiped out Nob, the city of the priests (1 Sam 22:19), and the text says concerning him, “and he did not seek the advice of the Lord” (1 Chr 10:14).

Verse 4

<b>For the proposal <i>yashar</i> (=was well received) by the people.</b> This is a verb in the past tense, because the latter syllable has a <i>pataḥ</i>.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>To Baalah, to Kiryath-jearim.</b> Kiryath-jearim is also called Baalah, as it says in the book of Joshua, “Then the boundary curved to Baalah—that is, Kiryath-jearim” (Jos 15:9), and also, “to Kiryath-baal—that is, Kiryath-jearim—a city of the Judahites” (Jos 18:14). Similarly, it says in the book of Samuel, “from Baalim of Judah” (2 Sam 6:2). It is there that the Ark stayed for twenty years (1 Sam 7:2), from the time it returned from the territory of the Philistines until David brought it up from there.
<b>Which was called “Name.”</b> In the book of Samuel the text explains that “attached to [the Ark] was the name of the Lord of Hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim” (2 Sam 6:2): that is why it was called “Name.” The reason the Ark is called this here and not elsewhere is that when it was in the land of the Philistines, the name of the Holy One, blessed is He, was sanctified in connection with it (1 Sam 5:1–12).

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>To the threshing floor of <i>Kidon</i> (=Chidon).</b> In the book of Samuel (2 6:6) [this is called] “the threshing floor of Nacon”: it had two names. It might be that it was called <i>Kidon</i> because Uzza died there, in the sense of “Let his eyes see <i>kido</i> (=his ruin)” (Job 21:20).

Verse 10

<b>Because [Uzza] laid a hand on the Ark</b>—for he was not a Levite. That was David’s mistake; for he should have had it brought by Levites, not on a cart, as it says, “But to the Kohathites he did not give any [carts]: because theirs was the service of the [most] sacred objects, their porterage had to be by shoulder” (Num 7:9). Accordingly, when he confessed his sin, he decreed that only the Levites should carry the Ark of the Lord (1 Chr 15:2), and he said, “the Lord … burst out against us, because we did not show due regard for Him” (ibid. v. 13). The reason David made this mistake—despite an explicit biblical verse—is that he thought there would be no infraction to carry it on a cart, even though it says “their porterage had to be by shoulder.” For he reasoned that it was for that time, in the wilderness, that God had commanded this: because the Tabernacle was transported on carts, He commanded that the Ark be carried by shoulder to show that the sanctity of the Ark is greater than the sanctity of the Tabernacle. But, [David] thought, should there come a time when there would be no Tabernacle with it, there would be no infraction to carry it on a cart. Furthermore, it had come by cart from the territory of the Philistines. This, then, was his mistake.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<i><b>Hekh</i> (היך) can I bring here.</b> This is equivalent to <i>ekh</i> (איך; =how), because the letters <i>alef</i>, <i>hei</i>, <i>vav</i>, and <i>yod</i> interchange. “<i>Hekh</i> can this servant of my lord” (Dan 10:17) also features a <i>hei</i>.

Verse 13

<b>The house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</b> He was a Levite, among the gatekeepers, as it says, “Obed-edom and Jeiel the gatekeepers” (1 Chr 15:18). Yet the text calls him a “Gittite,” because he made his home in Gath.

The <i>mem</i> in <i>le-ma-ba-rishonah</i> has a <i>pataḥ</i>, though as a rule, it should properly take a <i>ḥireq</i>. The same is true for “they did not sanctify themselves <i>le-ma-day</i> (=in great enough numbers)” (2 Chr 30:3), and for “His words were smoother <i>ma-ḥama’ot</i> (מחמאות; =than butter)” (Ps 55:22).

<b>Zechariah, <i>Ben</i>.</b> That was his name: “Ben.” This is also how my master, my father, of blessed memory (<i>Sefer Ha-Galuy</i> 11), explained <i>la-Ben</i> in the book of Psalms (9:1); that is, it refers to this musician, who played that psalm, composed by David on the death of Goliath and the defeat of the Philistines. Even though the <i>lamed</i> of <i>la-Ben</i> has a <i>pataḥ</i> that serves the function of a definite <i>hei</i>, and a definite <i>hei</i> does not belong with the name of a person, the function of this particular definite <i>hei</i> is to clarify that <i>Ben</i> refers to the musician. For had the text said <i>le-Ben</i>, it would have seemed as though [the noun] was related to <i>banim</i> (=sons).
<b>The gatekeepers.</b> For they guarded the Ark after it was placed in the tent that David pitched for it (1 Chr 16:1). Alternatively, they had <i>originally</i> been gatekeepers, when the Ark was in Shiloh, Nob, and Gibeon.

Verse 22

<i><b>Yasor</i> (יסר) <i>ba-massa</b></i> <b>(=[Chenaniah] distinguished himself in prophetic inspiration), for he was a master.</b> This means: Besides the musical talent that he had, he was a leader of distinction (<i>sar</i> [שר] <i>ve-gadol</i>) in prophetic inspiration, for he was a master. But some (cf. Pseudo-Rashi) explain this to mean “with the power of his voice,” in the same sense as “<i>vayyissa</i> (=he raised) his voice” (Gen 29:11); that is, he distinguished himself above all the rest with the power of his singing voice. <i>Yasor</i> is spelled with a <i>samekh</i>; but it is as though it had a <i>sin</i>. Similarly, “They are all <i>sarei</i> (סרי; =officers of) deviance” (Jer 6:28) is equivalent to שרי, with a <i>sin</i>.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<i><b>Maḥṣerim</i> (מחצצרים; =would sound).</b> This is spelled with two <i>ṣadei</i>s, the first one pronounced, the second one unpronounced. The same is true for <i>Yissakhar</i> (ישָשכר; =Issachar; Gen 30:18): the first <i>sin</i> is pronounced, the second one unpronounced. And the same for “<i>u-Meḥiyya’el</i> (ומחיָיאל; =and Mehujael) begot Methuseal” (Gen 4:18) and “<i>Yir’iyyah</i> (יראיָיה; =Irijah) son of Shelemiah” (Jer 37:13): the first <i>yod</i> is pronounced, the second one unpronounced.
<b>And Jehiah.</b> This is the same as Jeiel mentioned above (v. 18): he had two names.
<b>Gatekeepers for the Ark.</b> That is, even though they were gatekeepers, they also were musicians.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>As God helped (<i>be‘zor ha-Elohim</i>) the Levites.</b> The <i>bet</i> of <i>be‘zor</i> has a <i>segol</i>, though as a rule, it should properly take a <i>pataḥ</i>. This “help” refers to their not having committed any violations when carrying the Ark, the way they had earlier when Uzza died. But our Sages, of blessed memory (cf. b. Sotah 35a), explain midrashically that this implies that the Ark carries itself. In the book of Samuel, the text says that they would offer this sacrifice after walking six steps (2 Sam 6:13).

Verse 27

<i><b>Mekhurbal</i> in a <i>me‘il buṣ</i> (=linen cloak). </b>[<i>Mekhurbal</i> means that David was] wrapped; compare the Aramaic <i>patteshehon ve-karbelatehon</i> (=their trousers and hats; Dan 3:21). The <i>me‘il buṣ</i> that the text mentions here is the same as the <i>efod bad</i> (=linen ephod) that it mentions in the book of Samuel (2 Sam 6:14). Targum Jonathan in fact renders <i>efod bad</i> as <i>kardot de-buṣ</i>. And [in the case of] “for maiden princesses were customarily dressed in <i>me‘ilim</i>” (2 Sam 13:18), he renders <i>kardotin</i>.
<b>And Chenaniah <i>ha-sar ha-massa</i>.</b> The genitive noun is elided: this means <i>ha-sar sar ha-massa</i> (=the chief, chief for prophetic inspiration). The same is true for “<i>ha-aron ha-berit</i> (=the Ark, [the Ark of] the Covenant)” (Jos 3:14), and others like these.

Verse 28

<i><b>Mashmi‘im</i> (=causing to be heard) on harps.</b> This means: <i>mashmi‘im qol</i> (=causing sounds to be heard; =playing music).

Verse 8

<b>Praise the Lord; call out in His name.</b> They performed this psalm on that day, before the Ark. The psalm also appears in the book of Psalms (105); there are only some small differences involving a few words, which do not affect the meaning. There the psalm [“Praise the Lord”] extends until “do not harm my prophets” (ibid. v. 15), which really also marks the end of our psalm bearing that heading; for “Sing to the Lord, all the earth” (1 Chr 16:23) is a new psalm. That psalm too appears in the book of Psalms (96), albeit with some small differences that do not affect the meaning.
<b>Praise the Lord.</b> These are the words of David to the musicians and to the congregation.
<b>Call out in His name (<i>qir’u bi-shmo</i>).</b> [This means] to cry out to Him in prayer, as in: “and I will call out in the name of (<i>eqra be-shem</i>) the Lord” (1 Kgs 18:24). Alternatively, <i>qir’u bi-shmo</i> means to teach the ways of the Lord, as in: “and Abram spread knowledge of (<i>vayyiqra … be-shem</i>) the Lord there” (Gen 13:4). That, in fact, is the sense of “<b>proclaim His deeds among the nations</b>,” “His deeds” referring to the ones He performed on the Philistines on the matter of the Ark (1 Sam 5).

Verse 9

<b>Sing to Him, play music to Him—</b>vocally and on instruments.
<b>Speak of all his wondrous acts.</b> Also, always speak to one another about His wondrous acts.

Verse 10

<b>Exult in His holy name.</b> You are able to exult over all the nations in His holy name, whose sanctity is affirmed through you; thus, <b>let</b> your <b>hearts rejoice</b> that you are <b>seekers of the Lord.</b> Alternatively, [this means]: Let the hearts of <i>all</i> the seekers of the Lord—even members of the other nations—rejoice in His name when they seek Him.

Verse 11

<b>Seek the Lord, His might.</b> The Ark is called “His might,” as it says, “He let His might go into captivity” (Ps 78:61).

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>O offspring of Israel, His servant.</b> In the book of Psalms [it says], “O offspring of Abraham, His servant” (Ps 105:6). The text here, though, says “offspring of Israel”; for when it says there “offspring of Abraham,” the intention is the offspring of Israel. After all, whereas Abraham had other offspring, the offspring of Israel consist of us specifically. When it says “offspring of Abraham,” it thus refers to the offspring of Israel.

Verse 14

<b>He is the Lord our God.</b> Even though <b>His judgments are throughout the earth</b>, He is our God and we are His nation.

Verse 15

<b>Be ever mindful of His covenant.</b> But in Psalms [it says], “He is ever mindful of His covenant” (Ps 105:8), meaning that He is ever mindful of the covenant that he made with Abraham, for the sake of his descendants. And He <b>commanded (<i>ṣivvah</i>) </b>that the <b>matter</b> that was between them—the promise that He made to him—endure <b>for a thousand generations</b>. Alternatively, <i>ṣivvah</i> means “He decreed,” as in “unless the Lord <i>ṣivvah</i> (=decreed so)” (Lam 3:37), and [the phrase] means: the matter that He decreed between the halves (Gen 15:9–21) shall be for a thousand generations. When the text says here “Be mindful,” it means: Always be mindful of His covenant, which is with you forever.

Verse 16

<b>That He made with Abraham</b>—as it says, “On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, ‘To your offspring I assign …” (Gen 15:18). And that covenant <b>and oath</b> was <i><b>le-Yiṣḥaq</b></i>, meaning for the sake of Isaac, and not for the sake of Ishmael and the sons of Keturah. For when the text says “To your offspring”—with a covenant and an oath—it means for Isaac, as it says, “For what will be called your ‘offspring’ will be from Isaac” (Gen 21:12). The oath was at the binding of Isaac. For it says, “By Myself I swear, the Lord declares” (Gen 22:1), and He [later] said to Isaac, “and I will fulfill the oath that I swore to your father Abraham” (Gen 26:3). The same oath and covenant He then confirmed <b>in a decree for Jacob, for Israel, as an eternal covenant</b>; for the oath and covenant were for his special offspring, not for Esau. Isaac, after all, said to Jacob, “May He grant the blessing of Abraham to you” (Gen 28:4).

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>Saying: “to you [<i>sing.</i>] I will give.”</b> [God] said this to each one of [the Patriarchs].
<b>As your [<i>pl</i>.] allotted heritage.</b> [This is said] addressing Israel.

Verse 19

<b>When you were.</b> This addresses the Patriarchs. Indeed, in Psalms it says, “When <i>they</i> were” (105:12).

Verse 20

<b>Wandering from nation to nation.</b> [This refers to] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Verse 21

<b>He reproved kings on their account.</b> [This refers to] Pharaoh and Abimelech.

Verse 22

<b>My anointed ones.</b> [This means]: My great ones, My princes. For [the Patriarchs] were highly regarded by kings, as though they had themselves been anointed kings. Thus, the Hittites said to Abraham, “You are God’s elect among us” (Gen 23:6). Also, Abimelech came to Isaac to make peace and to make a covenant with him (Gen 26:26–29).
<i><b>U-bi-nevi’ay</i> (=with my prophets) do not act badly.</b> For [the Patriarchs] were prophets: God would speak with them. He in fact said about Abraham, “Restore the man’s wife, for he is a prophet” (Gen 20:7). Now in Psalms (105:15) [it says] <i>ve-li-nevi’ay</i> (=<i>to</i> my prophets), with a <i>lamed</i>. But it is one and the same; for what that means is: do not do anything harmful to them.

Verse 23

<b>Sing to the Lord, all the earth.</b> They recited this psalm too on that day. Our Sages, of blessed memory (Seder Olam 12), say that they recited “Praise the Lord” (v. 8) in the morning and “Sing to the Lord” in the afternoon—in which case they recited these two psalms every day before the Ark for the entire period prior to Solomon’s transfer of the Ark to the eternal Sanctuary.
<b>Proclaim His salvation <i>mi-yom el yom</i> (=day after day).</b> This is equivalent to <i>yom be-yomo</i> (=each day as required; v. 37), meaning: Proclaim His salvation every day, for He constantly saves you from your enemies. The [specific] reference here is to the saving of the Ark—for the Philistines returned it against their will (1 Sam 5–6). It is in reference to this that the text says, “Tell of His glory among the nations” (v. 24); for the episode of the Ark brought great glory, and it was through it that the nations were expected to recognize that<b> all the gods of the nations are mere idols, while the Lord made the heavens.</b> For even the service of those who worship the heavenly hosts is vanity: because He made the heavens, their hosts, the earth, the sea, and all that is contained in them (cf. Exod 19:10), it is only sensible to worship the Master, not the servants. Indeed, the Philistines’ god Dagon fell and broke apart before the Ark, whereas the Ark remained in its glory (1 Sam 5:3). Hence they glorified and aggrandized Him when they saw His wonders (1 Sam 6:1–18).

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

<b>Glory and majesty are before Him; strength and joy are in His place.</b> For when the Ark stayed in the territory of the Philistines, there was wailing and crying among them the entire time.

Verse 28

<b>Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the nations.</b> For all the nations who see and hear this shall ascribe to Him<b> glory</b> and <b>strength</b>: this is the sense of all the verses. Although this psalm refers to the episode of the Ark, it also refers forward to the present exile: when God, on taking us out of this exile and gathering us in, will show His wonders, He will do so to the point that all the families of the nations ascribe to Him glory and strength in accordance with the verse, “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth” (Zech 14:9), as it says here, “Let them declare among the nations that the Lord is King” (v. 31). Similarly it says, “Let the sea and all within it thunder, the fields and everything in them exult” (v. 32). And so too in the context of the ingathering of the exiles: “Before you, mount and hill shall clap aloud, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands” (Isa 55:12), so that people will say to one another, “Praise the Lord for He is good; his steadfast love is eternal” (1 Chr 16:34).

Verse 36

<b>Blessed is the Lord, God of Israel.</b> This verse marks the end of the words of praise and acclaim: when the musicians completed these psalms, ending with the recitation of this verse, <b>all the people said “Amen” and “Praise the Lord.”</b>

Verse 37

<b>[David] left there before the Ark of the Covenant, etc.</b> He left <b>Asaph</b> and the rest of the musicians there to stand regularly <b>before the Ark</b> to minister, sing, and play music <b>as each day required</b>, and to sacrifice burnt-offerings, because a non-priest can bring an offering on a small shrine. But he told <b>Zadok the priest and his fellow priests</b> to go to Gibeon <b>before the Tabernacle of the Lord</b> to process <b>burnt-offerings morning and evening</b>, because the largest shrine was there, and only a priest may bring an offering on it.

Verse 38

<b>Along with Obed-edom and their kinsmen.</b> This means: and his sons and their kinsmen; for that is what the text says below: “they and his sons and their kinsmen” (cf. 1 Chr 26:8).

Verse 5

<b>From Tent to Tent and from Tabernacle.</b> This means to say: “and from Tabernacle <i>to Tabernacle</i>”; but because it says “from Tent to Tent,” it relies on the reader’s understanding. The meaning of “from Tent to Tent” is: from the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness to Gilgal, from Gilgal to Shiloh, from Shiloh to Nob, and from Nob to Gibeon. In all those places, the altar and the Ark were under the cloths [of the Tabernacle]. And even when the Ark was in Kiryath-jearim, the altar was in Nob and Gibeon the entire time (2 Chr 1:3–5).

Verse 6

<b>Any of the chieftains of Israel (<i>shofetei Yisra’el</i>).</b> In the parallel verse in the book of Samuel [it says] “any of the <i>shivtei Yisra’el</i>” (2 Sam 7:7), because the chief official is called a <i>shevet</i>, as in “The <i>shevet</i> shall not depart from Judah” (Gen 49:10), and “your royal <i>shevet</i> (=scepter) is a <i>shevet</i> of equity” (Ps 45:7).

Verse 7

<b>From the <i>naveh</i> (=abode).</b> Folds for flocks are called a <i>naveh</i>, as the text says, “<i>nevot</i> (=abodes consisting of) shepherds’ dugouts and folds for flocks” (Zeph 2:6).

Verse 8

<b>I will give you renown like that of the greatest men on earth</b>—as it says, “David became famous throughout the lands, and the Lord put the fear of him in all the nations” (1 Chr 14:17).

Verse 10

<b>Ever since etc.</b> In the beginning [enemy nations] used to wear down [the Israelites]; and from the time I <b>appointed chieftains</b> over them, [enemy nations] would similarly cause them distress. Even though the chieftains would save them, they have not been fully at peace until now.

<b>You regard me as having the <i>tor</i> of a person of distinction.</b> This means: You regard me as having the kind of great qualities that characterize a great person, even though I am belittled and despised. <i>Tor</i> has the sense of a set nature—as does “the <i>torah</i> of a person,” the formulation that appears in the book of Samuel (2 Sam 7:19). Similarly, “Your cheeks are comely with <i>torim</i>” (Song 1:10) refers to pearls that are neatly connected to one another according to a set arrangement.

In the book of Samuel it says, “whom You redeemed from Egypt, nations and their gods” (2 Sam 7:23), which means either: <i>from</i> nations and <i>from</i> their gods, or: <i>and You defeated</i> nations and their gods.

Verse 3

<b>At Hamath.</b> [David] defeated Hadarezer in Hamath, when Hadarezer was on his way <b>to establish control (<i>lehaṣṣiv yado</i>) at the Euphrates River</b>. For Hadarezer had set out to conquer the land and establish his boundary at the Euphrates River, which was the boundary of the land of Israel. This took place in Hamath because the war in which Hadarezer was involved was with King Toi of Hamath, as the text says, “for Hadarezer had been at war with Toi” (2 Sam 8:10). In the book of Samuel, however, [it says] “to <i>restore</i> control (<i>lehashiv yado</i>)” (ibid. v. 3), meaning to retake (<i>lehashiv</i>) the land for himself.

Verse 4

<b>David captured from him one thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen.</b> But in the book of Samuel [it says] “one thousand seven hundred horsemen” (ibid. v. 4)! It seems that the text there only counts the high-ranking officers of Hadarezer’s camp, whereas in this book it counts all the horsemen. Also, there it does not provide a number for the chariots, whereas here it does; and there it mentions the foot soldiers, whereas here it does not.
<b>And David hamstrung all the chariot horses.</b> For it was forbidden for him to have many horses, as the text says, “[The king] shall not have many horses” (Deut 17:16).
<b>But he retained a hundred of them</b>—in accordance with his needs.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>David stationed in Aram of Damascus.</b> This means that he stationed garrisons and officers there, as it says in the book of Samuel, “David stationed garrisons in Aram of Damascus” (2 Sam 8:6). There it says “and from Betah (<i><b>בטה</b></i>) and Berothai” (ibid. v. 8), whereas here it says “and from Tibbath (<i><b>טבחת</b></i>) and Cun” (v. 8), because the cities were called by both names. Indeed, <i><b>טבחת</b></i> and <i><b>בטח</b></i> are one and the same, only the letters are transposed.

Verse 12

<b>Abshai son of Zeruiah etc.</b> The question arises that, in the book of Psalms, the text attributes this war to Joab and says “twelve thousand” (Ps 60:2), whereas here it attributes it to Abshai and—as in the book of Samuel (2 Sam 8:13)—says “<b>eighteen thousand</b>”! Furthermore, in two of the books it says “Edom,” whereas in the book of Samuel it says “Aram” (ibid.)! It seems that the Edomite war took place at the same time as the Aramean war, because that is what the text says in Psalms: “When he fought with Aram-Naharaim and with Aram-Zobah” (Ps 60:2). So these eighteen thousand were from Aram <i>and</i> Edom: when it says in one place “Aram,” it means together with those who were with them, namely Edom, and when it says elsewhere “Edom,” it means together with those who were with them, namely Aram. And the reason it says here that Abshai waged this war and says “eighteen thousand,” whereas in Psalms it says “Joab” and “twelve thousand,” is that Abishai did battle first and killed six thousand of them, after which Joab came and killed twelve thousand of them. This, then, is the meaning of <i>vayyashov Yoav</i> (=and Joab [smote] once again) in Psalms (ibid.)—that is, after Abshai. The reason the text here attributes the entire war to Abshai is that he started it. In the book of Samuel, however, the text attributes it to David (2 Sam 8:13), because he is the essential one.

<b>Until the <i>mifsa‘ah</i>.</b> This means the nakedness. It is of [the root attested in] <i>efse‘ah bah</i> (=I will stomp on it; Isa 27:4). The text also invokes legs [themselves] as a euphemism for nakedness: “He had not cleaned up his legs” (2 Sam 19:25). In the parallel verse in Samuel [it says], “until their foundations (<i>shetotehem</i>)” (2 Sam 10:4), which is also a euphemism for nakedness.

When it says in the book of Samuel “seven hundred charioteers,” it means to say seven hundred elite charioteers, and it does not count the rest of them. But in this book it counts all the charioteers, who totaled seven thousand. And there it provides a number for the horsemen—who totaled forty thousand—but not for the footmen, whereas here it does so for the footmen but not for the horsemen.

Chapter 20



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>[The crown] was placed on David’s head.</b> [Interpreters] ask (e.g., Pseudo-Rashi): How could he have withstood it, when it weighed a talent of gold? So they say that it was suspended above his head: he would sit under it on the throne, with it directly over his head. In a rabbinic source [we find] (b. Avodah Zarah 44a) that the precious stone in it was a drawing stone, which would keep it in the air. The Sages also suggest (ibid<i>.</i>) that a talent of gold is what the precious stone in it <i>was worth</i>. But possibly, one can explain that it was not always on his head. Rather, it was on his head once or twice, and he was able to withstand it for that brief period.

Verse 3

<i><b>Vayyasar</i> with a saw. </b>[David] crushed [the people of Rabbah] with a saw. <i>Vayyasar</i> (<i>וישר</i>) is similar to: “Or a <i>massor</i> (=saw) magnify itself” (Isa 10:15), and [the <i>sin</i>] should in principle have been geminated.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Elhanan son of Jair [killed] <i>et Laḥmi</i> the brother of Goliath the Gittite.</b> But in the book of Samuel [it says], “Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim (<i>Oregim</i> [=weavers]) the Bethlehemite (<i>Bet ha-Laḥmi</i>) [killed] Goliath the Gittite” (2 Sam 21:19). Now Goliath the Gittite is the same as Goliath the Philistine—after all, the text says there that “his name was Goliath, the Philistine of Gath” (1 Sam 17:23)—and it was not Elhanan who killed <i>him</i>, but David (1 Sam 17:49–50)! So there remains something elusive about the verse in [2] Samuel. “The Bethlehemite” who “killed Goliath the Gittite,” however, indeed refers to David. Here also, in fact, when the text says <i>et Laḥmi</i>, it means: <i>with the Lehemite</i>, that is, David. Still, it was Elhanan who killed [Goliath’s] brother: perhaps the reason it mentions David also is that he assisted in the killing. So there it reports the death of Goliath, whom David killed, whereas here it reports the death of his brother, whom Elhanan killed. But Targum Jonathan renders the verse in [2] Samuel as follows: “David son of Jesse of Bethlehem, weaver of the curtains of the Holy Temple.”

Verse 6

<b>A man of size (<i>middah</i>).</b> This means great size, as in “men of <i>middot</i>” (Num 13:32). In the book of Samuel, though, it says “a man of <i>madon</i> (<i><b>מדון</b></i>)” (2 Sam 21:20): the <i>nun</i> functions in place of the doubling [of the letter], akin to the <i>nun</i>s in <i>ma‘uzneha</i> (=its strongholds; Isa 23:11) and <i>ki lo tamnu</i> (=have not ended; Lam 3:22). Alternatively, the <i>nun</i> is like the <i>nun</i> of <i>zikkaron</i> (<i><b>זכרון</b></i>; =reminder; Exod 17:14), and whereas the <i>dalet</i> should in principle have been geminated because it is not doubled, the vowel-letter compensates for this.
<b>Six and six—twenty-four.</b> Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Bekhorot 45b), say: “Why did the text have to say ‘twenty-four’? Because had it not said twenty-four, I might have understood: six on his two hands and six on his two feet. Thus it says ‘twenty-four.’ And had it said ‘twenty-four’ but not ‘six and six,’ I might have understood that one hand had five and the other seven. Thus it says ‘six and six.’”
<i><b>Le-ha-rafa</i> (<i></b>להרפא</i><b>).</b> My master, my father, of blessed memory (<i>Sefer Ha-Galuy</i> entry <i><b>רף</b></i>), writes that this noun refers not to a female but to a male: it is akin to <i>Refa’im</i>—[a people] consisting of giants (Deut 2:11)—the singular of which is <i>Rafa</i>. When the text says <i>le-ha-rafa</i>, it is as though it had said <i>la-‘anaq</i> (=to the giant), with the <i>hei</i> functioning to make it definite. In two places in this context, <i>rafa</i> is spelled with an <i>alef</i> (vv. 6, 8), whereas in the book of Samuel it is spelled with a <i>hei</i> (2 Samuel 21:20); for the letters <i>alef</i>, <i>hei</i>, <i>vav</i>, and <i>yod</i> interchange.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<i><b>Nulledu</i> (<i></b>נוּלּדו</i><b>; =were descended).</b> This is the equivalent of <i>noledu</i>, with the gemination displacing [the lengthening suggested by] the vowel-letter. Even though the <i>vav</i> is present, because the <i>lamed</i> is geminated here, the <i>vav</i> is ignored in pronunciation.

Chapter 21



Verse 1

<b>Satan arose against Israel and incited David, etc.</b> This refers to what is ingrained in a person’s heart from his youth. Now in the book of Samuel it says, “The anger of the Lord again flared up against Israel, and He incited David against them” (2 Sam 24:1), from which it seems that it is the Lord who did the inciting. This is true: He incited him—through the Satan—because of Israel’s sinful behavior; for they deserved to be punished. Satan is also called “the angel of the Lord”: it was he whom David saw in the form of the angel of the Lord with a drawn sword in his hand (v. 16). After all, he is the one who leads people to err <i>and</i> the one who puts them to death.

<b>One million one-hundred thousand ready to draw the sword, and in Judah there were four-hundred-and-seventy thousand men ready to draw the sword.</b> But in the book of Samuel [it says] that “in Israel [there were] eight-hundred thousand” and that “[the men of] Judah numbered five-hundred thousand” (2 Sam 24:9)! We find in an aggadah (Pesiqta Rabbati 44:1): “Rabbi Judah ben Levi said: The verses include in one place what is missing from the other—meaning two tribes that were not counted—for the text indeed says, ‘He did not record among them Levi and Benjamin’ (1 Chr 21:6). He figured: I can get away with omitting these, on the grounds that the tribe of Levi is not counted with the rest of the tribes but rather from the age of one month and older (Num 3:15); and the tribe of Benjamin suffered enough loss and devastation in the matter of the concubine at Gibeah (Judg 20:35–48).” But according to this interpretation, that verse—“He did not record among them Levi and Benjamin”—should have been written in Samuel, because it provides the reason for the lower number recorded there but no reason for the lower number of Judahites in this book! In the Thirty-two Principles of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Jose of Galilee (Principle 15) it says: “How does one apply [the principle of scriptural interpretation concerning] two texts that stand in contradiction to one another, [which provides that] a third text be invoked to decide between them? One text says, ‘All Israel comprised one million one-hundred thousand ready to draw the sword, whereas in Judah there were four-hundred-and-seventy thousand men ready to draw the sword’; and another text says, ‘In Israel there were eight-hundred thousand men, and the men of Judah numbered five-hundred thousand’ (2 Sam 24:9). There emerges between them a difference of three-hundred thousand men! What accounts for those three-hundred thousand men? A deciding verse resolves this: ‘The number of Israelites—chiefs of clans, officers of thousands and hundreds and their clerks, who served the king in all matters of the divisions, who worked in monthly shifts during all the months of the year—each division twenty-four thousand’ (1 Chr 27:1). Those three-hundred thousand, then, were recorded in the king’s registry, and did not need to be counted. How so? Twenty-four thousand times twelve equals two-hundred-and-eighty-eight thousand, with the remaining twelve thousand comprising the leaders of Israel. So having left them out in one place, the text proceeds to include them elsewhere.” But this too does not provide any reason for the lower number of Judahites found here. For in the book of Samuel it says “five-hundred thousand,” while here it says “four-hundred-and-seventy thousand.” It emerges that thirty thousand are missing! Perhaps those thirty thousand died in the plague. After all, the casualties of the plague totaled seventy thousand (v. 14), thirty thousand of whom could have been from Judah. The reason why so many Judahites died would then be that Judah is David’s tribe and he was the cause of it all.

<b>Either three years of famine.</b> But in the book of Samuel it says, “Shall a <i>seven</i>-year famine come upon you in the land” (2 Sam 24:13)! What [Gad] really conveyed to [David] was three years, but he said to him “seven” because there had already been three years of famine at that point, as it says, “There was a famine during the reign of David, year after year for three years” (2 Sam 21:1). So Gad said to him, “Shall a seven-year famine come upon you in the land,” meaning: Is this what you wish to choose? After all, there have already been three years of famine, three more now will total six, and by the time produce arrives after six years of famine, the seventh year will not escape without famine, even though there will be rains, a plowing season, and a harvesting season.
<i><b>Le-masseget</i> (=overtaking you).</b> The <i>lamed</i> is like the <i>lamed</i>s in “<i>le-ammot ḥamesh</i>” (=five cubits; 2 Chr 3:11), “make <i>le-kol kelav</i> (=all its utensils) of copper” (Exod 27:3), and those like them, which are extraneous to the meaning.

<b>So David paid Ornan for the site gold shekels valued at six hundred.</b> But in the book of Samuel [it says], “So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen with fifty silver shekels” (2 Sam 24:24)! Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Zevaḥim 116b), say: “He collected fifty from each tribe, six hundred silver [shekel-pieces] all together.” But because their value in weight was that of shekels of gold, it says “gold shekels.” (Indeed, they also say [Sifrei Deut 70]: “One verse says ‘in one of your tribal territories’ [Deut 12:14], and another verse says ‘from all your tribes’ [Deut 12:5]. It is in this connection that Rabbi Judah says: Money from all your tribes; the specially designated Temple in the territory of one tribe.”) “Rabbi says in the name of Rabbi Jose son of Dustai: The oxen, the wood, and the place designated for the altar were for fifty, and the [area for] the entire Temple for six hundred.” The language of the verses proves Rabbi correct. For in the book of Samuel it says, “the threshing floor and the oxen with fifty silver shekels,” from which it seems that the threshing floor and the oxen were for fifty; and here it says, “So David paid Ornan for the site gold shekels [valued at six hundred],” meaning the entire site. For the altar was on the [site of] the threshing floor (v. 18), whereas the Temple was built on the entire field.

<b>In the shrine at Gibeon.</b> The entire structure that contained the Tabernacle and the altar was called a “shrine,” because the shrine—that is, the altar—was in it. The same is true for “before he goes up to the shrine to eat” (1 Sam 9:13); for they did not eat at the altar, but rather in the structures that housed the altar. That is what “the shrine” means.

<b>You have shed much blood.</b> We do not find that the Lord told [David] this. Rather, it was David who, in his heart, thought that God had prevented him from building the Temple because of this. Or the prophet Nathan told him so; for even though the text does not say that in the book of Samuel, we find many cases like this, [such as] “and you said: ‘Let us send men ahead’” (Deut 1:22). When the text then says “<b>you have shed much blood on the earth before Me</b>,” “before Me” seems to mean that among the blood that [David] shed was the blood of innocent people, such as that of Uriah (2 Sam 11:14–17). He was also the cause of the deaths of the priests, as it says, “I then am the cause of all the deaths in your father’s house” (1 Sam 22:22). It is also possible that among the gentiles he killed who were not engaging him in battle, there were good and righteous people, although he was not punished for this because his intent was to wipe out the wicked ones so that they not infiltrate Israel. [Similarly], when he was in the land of the Philistines, it was to save himself that “he would leave no man or woman alive” (1 Sam 27:9). But because he ended up shedding a great deal of blood, [God] prevented him from building the Holy Temple, which is for peace, atonement for sins, and intense prayer. This is akin to the reason that He prohibited wielding an iron tool over the altar (Deut 27:5) and the Holy Temple (1 Kgs 6:7): because weapons for killing are made of iron, one should not generally make from it objects designated for peaceful purposes.

If he had not acquired them—how can someone dedicate what does not belong to him? Apparently, they were resting within his immediate four cubits. Rabbi Bun says, ‘In my penury’—for wealth is irrelevant before God. Another interpretation: <i>Be-‘onyi</i>—for he used to fast (<i>mit‘anneh</i>) and dedicate his meal to the [service of] God.”

<b>The Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.</b> Ladan is the same as Livni mentioned in the Torah (Exod 6:17). He is mentioned as Livni earlier in this book (6:5).

Verse 8

<b>The sons of Ladan the chief Jehiel.</b> “Jehiel the chief” is [one] intended meaning, but there is in no single, exclusive reading: [the word “chief”] refers both to what appears before it and to what appears after it. For Livni—who is the same as Ladan—was Gershon’s first-born [and thus a “chief”], and Jehiel was the first-born of Livni. Jehiel is the same as Jahath mentioned above (ibid.). <b>Zetham and Joel</b> are also sons of Ladan; so here they total three. But below, the text says that Zetham and Joel are sons of Jehiel, for it says, “The sons of Jehiel: Zetham and his brother Joel” (cf. 1 Chr 26:22)! We may infer that here it includes grandsons with sons: there are many cases like this in the book. Alternatively, we might explain that it says below “The sons of Jehiel: Zetham and Joel” because his sons were named for his brothers. Or it elides a <i>vav</i>, and it means: The sons of Jehiel <i>and</i> Zetham (<i>ve-Zetam</i>) his brother were over the treasuries of the House of the Lord.

Verse 9

<b>The sons of Shimei.</b> This Shimei is not a son of Gershon. Rather, one of the sons of Ladan that are mentioned had a name “Shimei,” and his sons were <b>Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran—three.</b>

<b>And the sons of Shimei.</b> This is Shimei son of Gershon.

<b>Also, the Levites need not carry the Tabernacle etc.</b> This means: After the Tent was put in place in Jerusalem, the Levites were to have no more carrying duties.

Verse 27

<b>Among the last matters of David.</b> This means: These were among the last of David’s acts: counting the Levites <b>who were twenty years old</b> and above, appointing them to their shifts, and making all the necessary preparations for the Sanctuary. For he had originally counted the ones who were thirty and above (1 Chr 23:3) consistent with what it says in the Torah (Num 4:3); but at this point, he figured that because the Levites do not have to carry anything by shoulder, he would appoint the ones who were twenty years old and above also.

Verse 28

<b>And over <i>tohorat le-kol qodesh</i>.</b> The Levites had to be prepared for <i>tohorat kol qodesh</i> (=the purification of all the holy things), as the text says in connection with Hezekiah: “The priests went into the House of the Lord to purify it … The Levites received [the unclean things] to take them outside to Wadi Kidron” (2 Chr 29:16).
<i><b>U-ma‘aseh ‘avodat</i> the House of God. <i></b>U-ma‘aseh</i> is not in the construct state, for it is vocalized with a <i>segol</i>. What this means is: <i>u-lema‘aseh ve-la-‘avodat</i> (=for activites and for the service of) the House of God—they had to be prepared for it all.

Verse 29

<b>For <i>mesurah</i> and <i>middah</i>.</b> They also had to be prepared to fix the quantities (<i>middot</i>) needed for the Sanctuary: one-third, one-quarter, or one-tenth of either a hin or an ephah. <i>Mesurah</i> is a general term for smaller measurements, and <i>middah</i> is a general term for larger measurements.

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b>And whenever offerings were made to the Lord.</b> [The Levites] also had to be prepared to sing praises any time offerings were brought on <b>sabbaths, new moons, and holidays</b>, and to help the priests on those days, because there were so many offerings. They would help bring the animals, prepare them, slaughter them, and perform any other task up until the catching of the blood; for the priests were commanded to do everything from that point on (b. Berakhot 31b).

Verse 3

<b>David and Zadok divided them (<i>vayyeḥaleqem</i>) etc.</b> The <i>yod</i> has a <i>segol</i> and the <i>ḥet</i> has a <i>qameṣ</i>; but this is just like <i>vayyaḥalqem</i>, with a <i>pataḥ</i>. The same is true for “<i>vayyeḥalqem</i> David” above (23:6), for they have the identical vocalization. I have already provided the philological explanation of this in the <i>Mikhlol</i> (35b). What this means is that David changed the shifts from their prior alignment. For there were originally eight from the family of Eleazar and eight from the family of Ithamar. But David saw that the male heads among the descendants of Eleazar were more numerous than those of Ithamar (v. 4). So he took with him one representative from Eleazar and another from Ithamar, and he added eight shifts. He thus established twenty-four shifts, sixteen from Eleazar and eight from Ithamar (ibid.). This, then, is the meaning of “there was a onefold increase in what was held by clans of Eleazar” (v. 6)—meaning above what had been beforehand—and “whatever Ithamar held they held” (ibid.)—meaning that what Ithamar had held beforehand they held at this point also, because no shifts were added to theirs. There is the following debate among our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Taanit 27a). Some of them say that Moses instituted eight shifts, four from the family of Eleazar and four from the family of Ithamar; that Samuel then came and realigned them into sixteen, eight from Eleazar and eight from Ithamar; and that David came and realigned them into twenty-four. And some of them say that Moses instituted sixteen, eight from Eleazar and eight from Ithamar, and that Samuel and David came and realigned them into twenty-four, as it says, “David and Samuel the seer established that they be set up like this” (1 Chr 9:22).

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>They divided them by lot, the one group together with the other.</b> This means that [David] gave no preference to one over the other, <b>because they were</b> all <b>Sanctuary officers and officers of God—the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar</b>. Thus, they followed whatever the lottery determined: he gave no preference to any one over another, except in the case of the high priesthood, which belonged to the descendants of Eleazar, as we have explained above (5:27). <b>Shemaiah son of Nethanel, the scribe</b>, wrote down twenty-four shifts and [the names of] the male heads, put them into an urn for drawing lots, <b>and the first lot fell on Jehoiarib</b> ….

<i><b>Avot</i> the head opposite his younger kinsman.</b> That was his name—<i>Avot</i> (=Avoth). “Opposite his younger kinsman” means that an older one did not take precedence over a younger one. Rather, [the Levites] too would draw lots among themselves, just as did the priests: both old and young followed whatever the lottery determined. Accordingly, it says “young and old alike, the wise one with the student” (1 Chr 25:8), the wise one meaning the older one and the student meaning the younger one.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

<b>David set apart.</b> This means that he set apart <b>the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun</b> to be musicians, others to be gatekeepers (1 Chr 26:1–19), and still others to be in charge of the treasuries of the House of the Lord (1 Chr 21:20–28)—everything as the text says. And they were divided into subgroups based on a lottery.
<b>Who prophesied to the accompaniment of lyres, harps, and cymbals.</b> The sons of Asaph would play their instruments, and the Divine spirit would descend upon Asaph, who would then perform the vocals accompanied by the lyres. The same was true for Heman and Jeduthun: all of them prophesied to the accompaniment of the musical instruments. After all, the book of Psalms was composed with Divine inspiration, and it contains prophecies and predictions concerning the exile and the redemption. Asaph had four sons (v. 2), and Jeduthun six (v. 3). But the list contains only five: “Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah” (v. 3)—so it says “six” when there were only five! In the account of the lottery, however, we find one not mentioned here, where it says, “the tenth, Shimei” (v. 17). There is thus an aggadah (Bereshit Rabbah 94:9) that when the text says “six,” this is because when David set them apart, Jeduthun had these five sons and his wife was pregnant with Shimei; and by Divine inspiration, David foresaw that Shimei also would be the head of a shift. It is also possible that Shimei was young at the time and was not yet qualified to perform or to be head of a shift. Only when he grew older would he become head of a shift. But because they were training him, and he was indeed destined to become head of a shift, the text lists him in the account of the lottery. Heman had fourteen sons; for “Romamti-ezer” (vv. 4, 31) is one name. Even though it appears here as two words, there are many cases like this. So among the three of them there were twenty-four shifts, paralleling the twenty-four that the priests had. Thus, Joseph son of Asaph, the head of the first Levite shift (v. 9), served together with Jehoiarib, the head of the first priestly shift (<b>1</b> 24:7); and so for all of them. And because each of the twenty-four heads of the Levite shifts, together with his brothers and sons, totaled twelve (vv. 9–31), they totaled two hundred and eighty-eight all together, as it says (v. 7).

Verse 2

<b>Who prophesied by order of the king.</b> This refers to the psalms that Asaph composed: he would compose them with Divine inspiration. The text says “by order of the king” because the king appointed him head of matters pertaining to singing and musical instruments and wrote his compositions in his book. It says similarly concerning Jeduthun: “who prophesied, praising and extolling the Lord” (v. 3). Concerning Heman too, who was a Korahite, it says, “the seer of the king, [who uttered] prophecies of God describing an exalted status” (ibid. v. 5)—a reference to the Psalms composed by the Korahites that contain predictions describing the exalting of Israel’s status and their redemption from exile.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.</b> The text says this because Asaph and Jeduthun did not have so many children. Or perhaps [Heman] had initially been sterile, and so he prayed to the Lord, who heard his prayers and gave him fourteen sons and three daughters.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>One shift opposite.</b> This means to say: opposite <i>another shift</i>. The same is true for: “from Tent to Tent and from Tabernacle” (1 Chr 17:5), as we have written (ibid.).

Verse 5

<b>Peullethai the eighth, for God had blessed him—</b>as it says above: “And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-edom and all he had” (1 Chr 13:14). Indeed, it says, “sixty-two of Obed-edom” (v. 8). But above it says, “and Obed-edom and their brothers—sixty-eight” (1 Chr 16:38)! It is possible that Obed-edom had six brothers, so that all together they totaled sixty-eight. The plural pronoun in “and their brothers” would then refer to Obed-edom <i>and his sons</i>, because their father’s brothers may also be called <i>their</i> brothers, as if they were their own. Here, though, the text says that “the <i>sons</i> of Obed-edom” (v. 8) totaled sixty-two. And when it says here “they and their sons and their brothers” (v. 8), “they” refers to the sons of Obed-edom, “and their sons” refers to the grandsons who are mentioned, and “and their brothers” to those not mentioned. Finally, “Man of ability” (v. 8) is like “men of ability.” Our Sages, of blessed memory, explain midrashically (b. Berakhot 63b) that “the Lord blessed the house of Obed-edom” in that his wife and eight daughters-in-law each gave birth to sextuplets, so that they amounted to sixty-two.

Verse 6

<b>Who were likened (<i>ha-mimshalim</i>) to their ancestral house, because they were men of great ability.</b> [Shemaiah’s sons] were similar to [the men of their ancestral house] in ability: their ancestral house consisted of men with great ability for service, and they were no different. <i>Ha-mimshalim</i> is an adjective, with a <i>ḥireq</i> under the <i>mem</i>, similar to “the cities <i>ha-mivdalot</i> (=marked off)” (Jos 16:9) and “Athaliah <i>ha-mirsha‘at</i> (=the wicked one)” (2 Chr 24:7).

<b>[The Levite gatekeepers] cast lots, young and old alike</b>—as we have explained above (24:31).
<b>For each gate.</b> This means that the lots they drew were not to determine who among them should serve first, but rather to whom should be assigned the east gate and to whom the west, south, and north gates. <b>The lot</b> for the east fell to <b>Shelemiah</b>, the north to <b>his son Zechariah</b>, <b>to Obed-edom the south</b>, and <b>to Shuppim and to Hosah the west</b>.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>And to his sons, the chamber of the Asuppim.</b> This means that his sons would guard the chamber of the Asuppim, which was outside the Temple court, to the south of it. “At the Asuppim—two, two” (v. 17) has two rabbinic interpretations (b. Tamid 27a): One is that each of the Asuppim chambers had two Levites; and the other is that each of the Asuppim chambers had one, so that it means: at the Asuppim, of which there were two, there were two Levites—one for each. These assignments, like the shifts, numbered twenty-four: six in the east, four in the north, four in the south, two and two at the Asuppim totaling four, four in the west, and two at the <i>parbar</i>, for a total of twenty-four (vv. 17–18). Our Sages divide these into twenty-four stations; for they say in the Mishnah (Middot 1:1): “The priests guard the Sanctuary at three stations: at the chamber of Abtinas, at the chamber of the spark, and at the chamber of the fireplace; and the Levites at twenty-one stations: five at the five gates of the Temple Mount and four at its four inner corners, five at the five gates of the Temple court and four at its four outer corners, one at the compartment for sacrifices, one at the compartment for the curtain, and one behind the chamber of the curtain.” They raise an objection on the basis of these verses, however, which, speaking about the <i>Levites</i>, list twenty-four (b. Tam. 27a)! And they reply that in twenty-four places priests are called Levites—for example: “But the priests—the Levites—descended from Zadok” (Ezek 44:15)—so here also, three were priests and twenty-one were Levites. They also resolve the verses in a different way, consistent with what appears in tractate Tamid (ibid.) and in Zevaḥim (55b). [In this context] they say: “What is the meaning of ‘at the <i>parbar</i>’ (v. 18)? It is akin to the expression <i>kelappei bar</i> (=positioned toward the outside).”

<b>The sons of Ladan.</b> He is the same as Livni, as we have explained (23:7). Perhaps the reason the text says “<b>the sons of the Gershonite</b>” is that there was another Ladan; so it says: The sons of Ladan who were Gershonites—that is, the six <b>clan chiefs of Ladan</b> mentioned above (23:7–9)—those <b>of Ladan the Gershonite</b> […]. But all this is just extra elaboration, for the text could have said it only once. One of the sons of Ladan the Gershonite was <b>Jehieli</b>, who was the first-born. It then says that these sons were “in charge of the treasuries of the House of the Lord” (v. 22).

Verse 22

Verse 25

<b>His son Rehabiah, his son Jeshaiah.</b> This means that Jeshaiah was a son of Rehabiah; for Eliezer’s only son was Rehabiah, as the text says above (23:17). In fact, Jeshaiah,<b> Joram</b>,<b> Zichri</b>, and<b> Shelomith</b> were [all] sons of Rehabiah. And whereas he had many sons, as it says, “the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous” (ibid.), Shelomith was chief over all of them, as it says, “Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasuries of dedicated things” (v. 26). (Shelomoth is the same as Shelomith, for after “his son Shelomith” it says, “That Shelomoth and his brothers” [ibid.].) Furthermore, it says, “anyone who dedicated something did so through Shelomith and his brothers” (v. 28). Whereas here the text says that Ahijah was over the treasuries of the House of God and the treasuries of the dedicated things (v. 20), afterward it says that Zetham and his brother Joel were over the treasuries of the House of the Lord (v. 22); still later it says that Shebuel son of Gershom son of Moses was the chief officer over the treasuries (v. 24); and finally it says that Shelomith and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things! It seems that initially Ahijah was appointed over the treasuries, and that Zetham and Joel were also appointed over them. But the treasuries—which consisted of everything dedicated over the course of all the generations from the wilderness until David—were divided up; for some people would dedicate for offerings, some for the construction of the Temple, and some for the furnishings of the House of the Lord. Each treasury, then, was independent, and there was an appointee over each. Shebuel, however, was a chief officer in charge of all of them, as the text says, “Shebuel son of Gershom son of Moses was the chief officer over the treasuries.” And Shelomith was appointed over everything dedicated from [the time of] Samuel onward: whatever was dedicated by Samuel, Saul, David, Abner, Joab, and the clan chiefs who were over the officers of thousands and hundreds was dedicated through Shelomith (vv. 26–28).

<b>For outside tasks.</b> [This means]: the tasks performed outside the city—chopping wood in the forests, hewing stones, and [working the] fields, vineyards, gardens, and orchards belonging to the Sanctuary. It was over these that Chenaniah and his sons were appointed. The text says “<b>over Israel</b>” because every year there were many Israelites who volunteered to dedicate some of their fruit and other produce, and these men were appointed as supervisors and foremen over their subordinates, who were appointed to gather everything in and bring it to the House of the Lord.

Verse 30

<b>Across the Jordan, on the west.</b> [This means on] the edge of the land that stands across the Jordan—that land’s western edge, which is near the Jordan. But the land of Gilead in its entirety stood to the east of the land of Israel, and it is regularly identified in those terms.

Verse 31

<b>They were investigated in the fortieth year of David’s reign.</b> This refers to those across the Jordan. In fact, the entire account leading up to this took place in the fortieth year; for the text says at the beginning, “When David reached a ripe old age, he made his son Solomon king … and the Levites were counted … and David formed them into divisions” (1 Chr 23:1–6). But the dividing of Israel took place at the beginning of his reign, as it says above, “And these were David’s chief warriors who strongly supported him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king” (1 Chr 11:10), listing the same warriors that it lists here. Asael the brother of Joab was the fourth one, for the fourth month (1 Chr 27:7), and he did not live much past the beginning of this reign, because Abner killed him (2 Sam 2:23).

<b>And [Benaiah’s] division—his son Ammizabad.</b> This means that his son Ammizabad was also over his division, subordinate to him.

Verse 7

<b>And [Asael’s] son Zebadiah after him.</b> For Asael was killed at the beginning of David’s reign (2 Sam 2:23); so in his place, David appointed Asael’s son Zebadiah chief over his division.

Verse 15

<b>Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel.</b> [This means]: from the family of Othniel son of Kenaz.

Verse 16

<b>Over the tribes of Israel: the chief officer of Reuben.</b> To this point the text listed the warriors who were heads of the divisions, and now it lists the officers who served as tribal heads—one chieftain for each tribe.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>Of Judah: Elihu, of the brothers of David.</b> He is one of the brothers of David mentioned above (2:13–15) and had two names. Alternatively, he is a different one, additional to those mentioned, as our Sages, of blessed memory, say in the midrashic interpretation that we cited above (2:15).

Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>David did not take a census of those under twenty years of age.</b> This means: Those whom David counted—twelve divisions of twenty-four thousand each—consisted entirely of men twenty years of age and older.
<b>For the Lord had promised to make Israel as numerous etc.</b> Even when the Holy One, blessed is He, said to count Israel, He only said to count those twenty years of age and older (Num 1:2–3); for He had promised to make their numbers as incalculable as that of <b>the stars in the sky</b>, as it says, “then your offspring too can be counted” (Gen 13:16). None of those whom David counted were among those counted by <b>Joab</b>, who <b>set out to count</b> all of Israel. [Joab]<b> did not finish, though</b>; for there were two tribes that he did not count “because the king’s command had become repugnant to Joab” (1 Chr 21:6). It says, after all, “<b>wrath struck Israel on account of this</b>.”

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>Over the royal treasuries.</b> Here the text lists those whom [David] appointed as managers and administrators over the labor and over the storage areas, both in his house and out in the field.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b>And over what was in the vineyards.</b> Shimei was appointed over the vineyards until the gathering of the grapes, and <b>Zabdi</b> was appointed over whatever was in the vineyards at the time of the gathering of the fruit and grapes from the harvest onward, as it says, “<b>for the storage areas</b>.”

Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

<b>The Ishmaelite.</b> The text calls [Obil] an Ishmaelite because he lived in the land of Ishmael. Similarly, “the Hagrite” (v. 31) means that [Jaziz] lived in the land of the Hagrites.

Verse 31



Verse 32

<b>Jehiel son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons</b>—for he would raise them and teach them.

Verse 33



Verse 34

<b>And after Ahitophel: Jehoiada.</b> This means: After the death of Ahitophel, the advisor to the king, his advisors were Jehoiada <b>and Abiathar</b>. And <b>Joab</b> was the commander of the army.

Chapter 28



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>King David rose to his feet.</b> He gathered his strength and rose up from the bed upon which he was lying—for he had already become bedridden as it says in the book of Kings. He then mustered the strength to walk to the place where he had commanded all of Israel to gather, rose up on his feet, and said all these things to them.

Verse 9

<b>Know the God of your father.</b> This is akin to: Know the Lord <i>your</i> God. When the text says “the God of your father,” it means that [Solomon] should rely on the tradition until he comes to know Him on his own.
<b>He discerns the <i>yeṣer</i> of every thought.</b> A creation of the heart is called a <i>yeṣer</i>, because the heart produces and molds (<i>yoṣer</i>) thoughts in the mind, be they good or bad.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>And <i>ganzakkav</i>.</b> [This means] its storerooms.

Verse 12

<b>All that he had by the spirit.</b> [This means] by prophetic inspiration, for [David] knew the plan of all the storerooms by Divine inspiration, either on his own or through the prophet Samuel.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Of the gold lampstands.</b> These are the ten lampstands that Solomon made (2 Chr 4:7). We do not find that he made silver lampstands, however. To what, then, does “<b>and of the silver lampstands</b>” refer? It seems that he made silver lampstands for the priests’ quarters to give them light, because they ate and slept there. But it was the gold ones that were in the Great Hall—ten of them: five to the right of the one that Moses made, and five to the left of it. Similarly, it was the gold tables (v. 16) that were for the bread of display, whereas the silver tables (ibid.) were used for slaughtering, and for placing upon them the flesh of the burnt offering to be cut up. For even though the text does not mention this in the account of the construction of the Temple (2 Chr 3:1–4:22), we know it from the construction of the Temple that Ezekiel witnessed in a prophetic vision.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>And of the <i>keforei</i> (</b>כפורי<b>) <i>zahav</i> (=<i>keforim</i> of gold).</b> Our Sages, of blessed memory, explain that these are dashing instruments. For they say (b. Zevaḥim 25a): “And with what would he wipe away the blood from the knife? With the rim of the dashing instrument, as it says, ‘And of the <i>keforei zahav</i>.’” They were called this because they were used for wiping the knife clean, as in “<i>mekhapper</i> (<b>מכפר</b>) it with a worn out cloth” (cf. b. Ḥullin 8b), which means “he wipes it off.” This is always the sense of <i>kapparah</i> (<b>כפרה)</b>.

Verse 18

<b>And the gold for the figure of the chariot—the cherubs.</b> This means: for the figure of the chariot of the holy creatures, because the faces of the cherubim were indeed on them.
<i><b>Le-poresim ve-sokhekhim</i>.</b> This means: <i>lihyot poresim</i> (=so that they might spread) their wings <i>ve-sokhekhim</i> (=and cover) <b>over the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord</b>.

Verse 19

<b>Everything in writing from the hand of the Lord.</b> This means: You have here everything written down neatly, the way the Lord, by His hand that was <b>upon me</b>, made me understand <b>the plan of all the works (<i>mal’akhot ha-tavnit</i>)</b>. For as we have written (v. 12), it was all told to him by Samuel the seer through prophecy. <i>Mal’akhot</i> is a plural noun, the construct form of <i>melakhot</i>: in the construct state the <i>alef</i> draws a vowel. The same it true when [the word has] a possessive ending: “that I may recount all <i>mal’akhotekha</i> (=your works)” (Ps 73:28).

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>And with you in all the work are all who volunteer in their skill (<i>le-kol nadiv ba-ḥokhmah</i>) for any task</b>—in the sense of “anyone whose heart <i>yiddevennu</i> (=prompts him to volunteer) to undertake the performance of the task” (cf. Exod 36:2). That is, skilled men are with you in all the work and in anything they volunteer (<i>be-kol asher yitnaddevu</i>) to do. <b>And the officers and the entire nation</b> are prepared <b>for anything you might need</b>.

Chapter 29



Verse 1

<b>An untried lad.</b> [The Sages] say (Seder Olam 14) that Solomon was twelve years old when he became king. For in the immediate context of his birth the text recounts the story of Amnon and Tamar and then says, “Two years later, Absalom was having his flocks sheared” (2 Sam 13:23); Absalom then killed Amnon, fled to Geshur, and stayed there three years (2 Sam 13:38), for a total of five; he then returned to Jerusalem and remained there for two years (2 Sam 14:28), for a total of seven, at which point he rebelled against his father and was killed (2 Sam 15–18); after that “there was a famine during the reign of David for three years” (2 Sam 21:1), for a total of ten; the following year, when David counted the Israelites, it says “they traversed the country … nine months” (2 Sam 24:8), for a total of eleven; and in the year of David’s death, the fortieth year of his reign (v. 27–28), he instituted the shifts (1 Chr 26:31), for a total of twelve.

Verse 2

<b>The gold for the gold and the silver for the silver.</b> This means: I laid aside the gold for whatever requires gold, and silver for whatever requires silver.
<b>Stones of <i>pukh</i> and <i>riqmah</i>.</b> This means: garments of <i>riqmah</i> (=woven colors) and stones of <i>pukh</i>.
<b>Every kind of precious stone—</b>for the walls of the Temple, as the text says concerning the construction of the Temple, “[Solomon] studded the Temple with precious stones” (2 Chr 3:6), and <b>marble</b> too for the walls of the Temple and for the floor. <i>Pukh</i> is stibium: possibly these were stibium stones; or they were precious stones that looked like stibium.

Verse 3

<i><b>Mi-kol hakhinoti</i>.</b> [This means]: <i>Mi-kol</i> asher <i>hakhinoti</i> (=[in addition to] all <i>that</i> I laid aside).

Verse 4

<b>For covering the walls of the houses.</b> But it was with <i>gold</i> that they covered the walls, as the text, “He overlaid the entire house with gold” (1 Kgs 6:22)! How then could the text say that he laid aside the <i>silver</i> to cover the walls? We may suggest that “for covering” refers to the thousands of gold talents that it mentioned. But in a rabbinic source (Song of Songs Rabbah 3:9–10) [we find]: “‘For covering the walls of the houses’—was it really <i>kesef</i> (=silver)? It was gold! Why then was it called <i>kesef</i>? Because it would put to shame (<i>mekhassef</i>) all the gold dealers.”

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>Ten thousand <i>adarkhon</i>s.</b> [This was] a coin known to them.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>God of Israel our father.</b> “Our father” refers to Israel. The text mentions our father Jacob in connection with the construction of the Temple because Jacob was the first to say to the Lord that the House of God ought to be built, as it says, “And this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be the House of God” (Gen 28:22). But in Genesis Rabbah (70:1–2) it is explained that the text mentions “Israel our father” because of the donations that they pledged (v. 9), because he was the first to make vows, as it says, “Jacob then made a vow, saying (<i>lemor</i>)” (Gen 28:20): “What is <i>lemor</i>? <i>Lemor</i> (=To impart) to subsequent generations that they should make vows in their times of crisis. Because Jacob was the first to utter a vow, anyone who makes a vow should make it reliant on him only. [Accordingly], Rabbi Abahu said: It says, ‘how he swore to the Lord, vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob’ (Ps 132:2). It does not say ‘to the Mighty One of Abraham, to the Mighty One of Isaac,’ only ‘to the Mighty One of Jacob,’ making the vow reliant on the one who first uttered one. Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Idi: It says, ‘The nation rejoiced over the donations they made … and David blessed the Lord … [and David said:] “Blessed are You, Lord, God of Israel our father”’ (v. 9–10). It does not say ‘God of Abraham, God of Isaac,’ only ‘God of Israel,’ making the vow reliant on the one who first uttered one.”

Verse 11

<b>Yours, Lord, are greatness and might etc.</b> This means: All this greatness and might that I have had, and my triumph over all the nations and my attainment of splendor, majesty and glory over them, are entirely Yours, because I received the strength from You. And all the gold and silver that I took from them and dedicated to You is entirely Yours, as the text says, “for all is from You, and it is Your gift that we have given to You” (v. 14).
<b>Because everything in heaven and on earth—to You, Lord, belongs kingship.</b> This means: Pertaining to whatever is in heaven and on earth, to You, Lord, belongs kingship. That is, in Your capacity as king, You rule over everything that is in heaven and on earth.
<b>And <i>ha-mitnassei le-kol le-rosh</i>.</b> This means <i>le-kol ha-rashim</i> (=above all the leaders) and kings: You are <i>ha-mitnassei</i> (=the One who is preeminent) above them all. (The <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-rosh</i> gives the meaning: above all who are appointed <i>le-rosh</i> [=to be leaders].) But our Sages, of blessed memory, explain: Anyone <i>ha-mitnassei</i> (=who is preeminent) and <i>kol she-hu rosh</i> (=anyone who is a leader) over anything is “to You”: what he has is all from You. In their words (b. Berakhot 58a): “Even the appointment of a foreman over cistern-diggers is from heaven.”

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>And inhabitants like all our fathers.</b> This means: If we are inhabitants of the world, we are inhabitants only as were our fathers, who died and are no longer. So we are really sojourners: like <b>a shadow</b>, which goes away quickly, so are <b>our days on earth</b>.
<b>And there is no source of hope.</b> There is no hope for a person to remain in the world for a long time, because his days are fixed.

Verse 16

<b>All this <i>hamon</i>.</b> This is akin to <i>mamon</i> (=assets), meaning the masses of silver, gold, and other things. The same is true for: “than much <i>hamon</i> for the wicked” (Ps 37:16).

Verse 17

<b>That You search the heart.</b> This means: You search hearts and desire uprightness of the heart. You thus know <b>the uprightness of my heart</b>—for what <b>I donated</b> was with an upright heart. And it is also You who knows what is in the heart of <b>Your people</b> who (<i>asher</i>) <b>are present (<i>nimṣe’u</i>) here</b>. I did however see the <b>joy</b> with which they donated <b>to You</b>, and it seems to me that they too donated with an upright heart. So just as their heart is upright today, <b>keep it like this forever</b>—that <b>the thoughts in</b> their<b> mind</b> and their <b>heart</b>s be steadfast<b> toward You</b>. The <i>hei</i> of <i>ha-nimṣe’u</i> (=who are present) is in place of <i>asher</i>: the same is true for “<i>he-halekhu</i> (=who had gone) with him” (Jos 10:24) and others besides these, as we have written in the <i>Mikhlol</i> (43b-44a).

Verse 22

<b>They again proclaimed Solomon king.</b> For on a different occasion David had proclaimed him king, when—as it says in the book of Samuel (cf. 1 Kgs 1:15–35)—Bathsheba came to him along with the prophet Nathan, who commanded him on that day to anoint him and proclaim him king. But at that time, the only Israelites who were present were the people of Jerusalem. So David subsequently gathered all the officers of Israel from all the tribes, and in front of them he proclaimed him king again.
<b>And they anointed before the Lord <i>le-nagid u-le-Ṣadoq</i> the priest.</b> This means: They anointed <i>him</i> before the Lord <i>le-nagid</i> (=as a ruler), <i>u-le-Ṣadoq</i> (=and Zadok) they anointed as high priest. Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Sanhedrin 20b-21a), cite this verse as a source that, of the spoils that the Israelites took from their enemies, half went to the king and half to the people: “The text juxtaposes ‘Zadok’ to ‘ruler’: just as in the case of Zadok half went to him and half to his fellow priests, as it says ‘They shall belong to Aaron and his sons’ (Lev 24:9), so too in the case of the ruler, half went to him and half to the people.”

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>And He endowed [Solomon] with regal majesty—</b>for the whole world feared him and exalted him. The text in the book of Daniel says in the negative [concerning a different king]: “whom they had not endowed with regal majesty” (Dan 11:21).
