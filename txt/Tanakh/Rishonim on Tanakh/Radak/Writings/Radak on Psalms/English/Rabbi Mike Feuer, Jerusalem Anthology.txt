But as for the river – its rivulets – At the time when the mountains quake and collapse and the waters of the sea are stirred up, that is to say – when there will be great distress and war between the kingdoms of the nations, Israel will not be afraid but instead will rejoice.  This is what is said in a metaphorical fashion: but as for the river, its rivulets will make to rejoice. In opposition to the raging seas it says that a river will come out from Jerusalem, which is the city of God. The rivulets of that river will make the city of God to rejoice, meaning the inhabitants of the city of God. That city is ‘the holy place of the dwellings of the Most High,’ meaning that all of the land of Israel is the dwelling of the Most High and the holiest place within it is Jerusalem. This metaphor is like that of “And you shall draw water with joy from the fountains of the salvation.” (Isaiah 12:3) Or it is to be understood literally, as it is written “And it shall come to pass on that day that spring water shall come forth from Jerusalem…” (Zechariah 14:8)

Verse 3

The fairest of branches (nof) – Mount Zion is the beauty of the place, there is nothing as beautiful as it in all the place. And it is ‘the joy of the entire earth’ as it is written “Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?” (Lamentations 2:15) The meaning of nof is place, as in “…the three regions (hanafet).” (Joshua 17:11) My father and master explained nof as one of the seven divisions of the world, because it is known that the settled world is divided into seven pieces as they said ‘the seven lands.’ These portions are called in Hebrew nafot and in Arabic iclimim. And he said that anyone who goes from one nof to another will fall ill due to the change in air. The air of the land of Israel, and all the more so the air of Jerusalem, was the fairest nof and the joy of all the earth. Even sick people who came there were healed because its air was well mixed and pleasant. As it says about it “And the neighbor shall not say, ‘I am sick.’” (Isaiah 33:24) Meaning that one who dwells in Jerusalem will not say ‘I am sick.’ Mount Zion, by the north side – Zion is on the north side of Jerusalem, as it says “…and I will sit on the mount of the assembly, in the farthest end of the north.” (Isaiah 14:13)  The previous part of the verse “above God's stars will I raise my throne” is a metaphor regarding Israel. the city of a great (rav) king – a great king, as in “…upon every steward of his house…” (Esther 1:8) This is referring to David, as it says “…the city wherein David encamped.” (Isaiah 29:1) Or this is referring to the King Messiah. In the midrash (Shachar Tov 48) it says everyone glorifies her, because there was none other like her. Even though Tyre said ‘I am the perfection of beauty’ as it says “Tyre, you said, 'I am the perfection of beauty.'” (Ezekiel 27:3) You said this of yourself, but others did not say it to you. This is like the common saying: not as your mother said, but as your neighbors said. But it doesn’t say this about Zion, rather everyone says “Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?” (Lamentations 2:15) And further ‘the joy of all the earth.’ And how did she bring joy to all the earth? If a man sinned and is downhearted, as Shlomo says “If there is concern in a man's heart, let him cast it down, and a good word will make it cheerful,” (Proverbs 12:25) he would go to Jerusalem and offer a sacrifice which would atone for him. His heart would rejoice and he would leave there joyful that he had been forgiven, therefore she is the joy of all the earth. 
Know that it is so, as it says “Mount Zion, by the north side” and it says “…on the northern side of the Mishkan…” (Exodus 40:22)

Verse 4

God is in its palaces – The palaces of other cities are strongly built and elevated to take shelter in. The strength of the palaces of Jerusalem is better than these because God is known in them and He is a stronghold to all who seek shelter in Him, as it is written “The name of the Lord is a tower of strength; the righteous runs into it and is strengthened.” (Proverbs 18:10)

From Zion, the finery of beauty – As it says in the prophecy of Yoel (4:16), “And the Lord shall roar from Zion, and from Jerusalem He shall give forth His voice…” as if from there He sends out His voice that everyone should come to Jerusalem.

With Your will, do good – In these last two verses it appears that the Holy Spirit returned to him while he was still praying. It says in this psalm “Restore to me the joy of Your salvation…” (Psalms 51:14) And so it was that it returned to him, because these verses are a prophecy of the future. He saw with the Holy Spirit that in the future the Holy Temple would be destroyed, both the first and the second, because of the sins. Even though they were offering the sacrifices continually, since their actions were evil God rejected the offerings and destroyed the Sanctuary. In the days of the Messiah the offerings will be acceptable because all of Israel will serve the Lord with one heart. Therefore it says “With Your will, do good to Zion…”

Why do you lurk (tratzdun) – There are those who explain tratzdun as dance, meaning why do you praise yourselves? You are considered nothing compared the mountain which God desired for His dwelling, which is the mountain of the House. Rabbenu Hai explained tratzdun as a language of consideration and expectation, comparing it to the Arabic in this case. The meaning then would be – why are you interested in and in expectation of honor? Honor is due only to the mountain which God desired for His dwelling. This is the mountain of the House where the Holy Temple is located, the cause of the glory of Jerusalem because there the glory is seen continually, as well as His aid and compassion. Behold, over all of the land of Israel the hand of the enemy rules, and of Jerusalem it says “…neither shall he shoot there an arrow, nor shall he advance upon it with a shield, nor shall he pile up a siege mound against it,” (Isaiah 37:33) and it says “And I will protect this city to save it…” (Isaiah 37:35) And the verse continues ‘Even the Lord will dwell there forever’ because on mount Sinai He did not dwell forever:

May there be an abundance of grain – In the days of this king there will be such blessing in the world that if one plants a handful of seed, even on the mountain tops, the grain stalks will be so good and healthy that they will shake in the wind like the cedars of Lebanon. Its fruits – This means the fruit of a handful of seed: 
They will blossom forth from the city – Outside, in the fields there will be blessing. So too in the city there will be blessing upon the people, to the point that they will blossom forth in their multitude like the grass of the earth:

His Tabernacle was in Shalem – Then His Tabernacle will be in Shalem, meaning that the Holy Temple will be rebuilt there. The verse mentions Zion in particular because it is the place of the king. Shalem is Jerusalem, as it says “And Malchizedek the king of Shalem…” (Genesis 14:18) This is Shem the son of Noah who called the place Shalem. Avraham called the Holy Temple Yireh, as it says “And Abraham named that place, The Lord will see (yireh)…” (Genesis 22:14) The Holy One said: if I call it as Shem called it, I will nullify the words of Avraham. And if I call it yireh, as Avraham called it, I will nullify the words of Shem. He called it Jerusalem (Yirushalayim).

The Lord loves the gates of Zion – It says ‘gates’ because the elders and the wise sit in the gates, as it says “…up to the gate, to the elders…” (Deuteronomy 25:7) and so too in the words of Boaz which describe the elders who were at the gate. (Ruth 4:11) Even though God loves all of the dwelling places of Yaakov, as it says “How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!” (Numbers 24:6) nevertheless He loves the gates of Zion more because there the wise are occupied with the service of Gd.

Verse 3

Glorious things – This means glorious attributes, and is speaking of those that inhabit you. Or its explanation is that glorious virtues will be attributed to you, that you are elevated over all lands in many things. The settled world is divided into seven portions, and Jerusalem is in the center portion, which is in the center of the civilized world. Thus it says “…dwelling on the navel of the earth.” (Ezekiel 38:12) Therefore its air is good, mingled from all airs, good for the health of the body and wisdom as it says “The fairest of branches, the joy of the entire earth…” (Psalms 48:3) and our Sages said “the air of the land of Israel makes one wise.” (Baba Batra 158b) 
The city of God, forever – Because God chose it to make His glory dwell there:

The Lord is great in Zion – Then He will be great in Zion because there He will be magnified above all the nations when He executes judgement on the wicked. In the midrash Shachar Tov it says: The Lord is great in Zion, when He returns His Presence to Zion, in that moment He is great.

Request – The children of exile are saying: request from God the peace of Jerusalem, and the peace of Jerusalem is the ingathering of the exiles. Until that time she will not have peace, because the uncircumcised and the Ishmaelites are fighting over her. And it says afterwards in relation to Jerusalem ‘may those who love you enjoy tranquility,’ which refers to Israel in exile who mourn over her destruction:

Verse 2

Jerusalem – Even though mountains surround her she lacks strength and the nations rule over her, conquering her one from another. And she will not have strength until the people of the Lord are within her, because then He will surround His people. Then His name will be a strength to them greater than mountains and the enemy will never again rule over them:

May the Lord bless you – According to the opinion of the commentators, this is referring to the priests who said to Israel in their blessing “may the Lord bless you.” According to my explanation, these are the words of the Psalmist who said ‘bless the Lord,’ meaning: if you bless Him, He will bless you. The explanation of ‘Zion’ is: there is the glory and from there blessing comes to all of Israel and all the land. 
It says ‘who made heaven and earth’ in order to say that He whom made the heavens which bring blessing to the world, and made the earth that gives its produce as a blessing, as He commands so He is blessed.
