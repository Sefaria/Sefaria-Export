Girded with might: He does not acquire His might from someone else when He needs it; rather, He shows His might at any time He wishes, for the might is His girdle.

Verse 9



To my understanding, these two verses speak about Israel. "He who quieted the raging waters before Israel," who split the sea and brought them through its midst, "He will quiet the multitude of nations" and their raging, and will bring up Israel from their midst. Just as those who live at the ends of the earth saw the signs You made for them at the Parting of the Sea of Reeds -- as it says (Exodus.15.14) "Nations heard, they were frightened" -- so too, at the ingathering of exiles, they will be afraid of You and awed by Your signs once again. And just as You caused their hearts to shout for joy by "bringing out morning and evening" (Exodus.13.22) 'a pillar of cloud each day and a pillar of fire at night,' You will do the same for them at the ingathering of exiles.

Verse 1

<b>Psalm.</b> 
This psalm is spoken about the perplexity of the children of the world regarding the peace of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous in this world. This poet Asaf speaks about his own tongue or the tongue of every fool:
He says, <b>"Surely God is good to Israel."</b>
Even though they are in exile, God is good to them and will continue to preserve their good deeds. It is also good for those with a sincere heart among the other nations, even though they experience evil in this world, they will have goodness in the world to come. And the meaning of "surely" is that I truly know what will happen, for He will still bestow goodness upon them.

Verse 2

<b>"And I, I am leaning."</b> It is written as "netuy" and pronounced as "netivo," which is an action done by a fool in this context.
The word <b>"shafcha"</b> (she poured) is written with a "heh" at the end, which indicates the feminine gender, referring to each foot. However, the pronunciation is "shafchu," with a "vav" added, referring to the two feet that are shackled. The meaning of the verse is that my steps almost slipped from faith when I saw the well-being of the wicked. 
<b>I poured out.</b> I almost relinquished my faith in the land, meaning as if I stood without any support, that I did not stumble. The matter that kept me standing was so slight that it seemed as if it didn't exist. Therefore, he said "as if it were nothing."

Verse 3

<b>Among the fools.</b> They are the wicked because they engage in the pleasures of this world, which are folly and foolishness, and they do not care if they commit any evil to satisfy their desires. And I saw them prospering in peace, and because of this, I was consumed with envy until my feet almost stumbled.

Verse 4

<b>For there are no pains in their death.</b> They enjoy goodness throughout their lives, until the day of their death. Even at the time of their death, they pass away calmly without distress. The meaning of "pains" refers to ties or connections, and someone who dies in pain and difficulty is as if they have ties that bind them to the realm of the living, and those ties do not release easily but with great difficulty. However, they pass away in tranquility as if there are no ties binding them to their death.
<b> And yet they are healthy.</b> They are robust and vigorous.
<b> Body</b>It is said that God's hands are not empty. It means that during their lifetime, they have natural strength that is healthy and strong, and in their death, they die peacefully.

Verse 5

<b>In trouble.</b> The rest of the people, who live in trouble and hardship, are not included in their [the wicked's] category. They attain their livelihood and pleasure without trouble. And when afflictions and illnesses befall the rest of mankind, they are not affected by them.

Verse 6

<b>"Therefore..."</b> They will wear arrogance around their necks, like a necklace, and their pride will cover them like a garment of violence. This is expressed by the phrase <b>"Violence covers them as a garment."</b> They will constantly be enveloped in this garment of violence, just as a person wears their clothing all day long.

Verse 7

<b>"They protrude."</b> Due to excessive fat, their eyes appear as if they are bulging out, as if they have no eyes. Because of the thickness of their facial fat, their eyes are covered.
<b> They have passed the limits of their heart.</b> It is interpreted as a withdrawal from truth, and the heart is called deceitful because it contemplates things. In other words, whatever they contemplate in terms of the good things of the world, thinking that they will have more and more of them, will ultimately pass them by, contrary to what they had imagined.

Verse 8

<b>"Let them melt away."</b> This verse is a prayer or wish for the wicked to be dissolved or destroyed. The commentary states that the term "מנחי העי"ן" (literally "the guidance of the eye") is not found in Scripture, but rather in the words of our sages. Additionally, the term "מק בשרו" (literally "his flesh") refers to the act of multiplying or duplicating, which can be found in his work and others. 
"And they speak wickedly, oppression." They do not hesitate to speak of the injustice they commit, nor do they conceal it. Rather, they openly speak of their wickedness.
<b>"From on high."</b> It means that there is no higher authority that will punish them for this.

Verse 9

<b> They set </b> The emphasis, in place of the implication that they spoke about me and my late father with contempt, is explained as the doubling of the root "שתת" (to set or place), meaning their mouths were set in motion as if speaking in the heavens, indicating that they speak about God without knowledge of Him.
<b> And their tongue walks in the land. </b> In other words, their actions and words, which are carried out on Earth, are observed by Heaven.

Verse 10

<b>Return</b> The letter "י" in the word "ישוב" indicates that God settles and resides in it. The letter "ו" in "ישוב" signifies that God declares with it that He sees the tranquility of the wicked being repeatedly disrupted time after time.
<b> Here </b> This word is used as a warning, meaning "do not approach" or "do not come close." It implies that if one can find an argument against it to justify the judgment, they should present it.
And they will be satisfied with water. Without the specified detail, it means that a person will find a trembling-filled cup for them, indicating that they will find a drink that both satisfies and enlivens them. This refers to them finding refreshing and invigorating water to quench their thirst.

Verse 11

<b>And they will say.</b> This is the deception we have been mistaken about all day, not knowing what it is: 'And they will say, <b>'How does God know? Can the Most High have knowledge?'</b> The ways of human beings are in God's hands, and doesn't God have faithfulness? If God knows the ways of human beings, how can He bring calamity upon His people who walk in His ways? How can He favor those who deny Him and the wicked of the world? And if there is knowledge in the Most High, how will it be?

Verse 12

<b>Behold, these are the wicked</b> They are always at ease and they increase their wealth and honor.

Verse 13

<b>Surely</b> When I served him in vain, I gained nothing in my heart, and in vain did I cleanse myself with cleanliness, meaning my heart is pure and my actions are righteous, yet I am afflicted and not at peace.

Verse 14

<b> וָאֱהִ֣י</b> I am good, yet afflicted by the hand of the wicked.
<b> All day long.</b>  Every day: And also <b> in the mornings.</b>  Continuously, with every morning, I receive rebuke and affliction at their hands.

Verse 15

<b>If I have said it.</b> This is the statement of Asaph or any righteous person in every generation. If I have said it, I will recount this accusation as they say, "Generation of your children, behold, I have been unfaithful to you." The word "behold" is used in both early and later contexts. If I have said it, I will recount it like the generation of your children, "Behold, I have been unfaithful to you," and many others have done so in similar circumstances.

Verse 16

<b>And I considered it.</b> Behold, I refrained from recounting it orally, as they say, "How can God know?" And behold, it is toil in my eyes, meaning in the eyes of my heart, for I have turned and turned in this accusation, and I cannot find anything in my heart to understand what this is. And it is written "hu" (he), with a Yod (י) on the accusation and the response to it, and it is called "hu" (he) with a Vav (ו) on the matter, and the matter and the subject are one.

Verse 17

<b>Until.</b> I have pondered in my heart to understand this with great toil, and I have not found until I delved into the thoughts of my heart, to the sanctuary of God. And that is the world of angels and spirits, for there lies the ultimate reward, for the goodness of this worldly existence does not endure. But in the end, it is the world of souls where the righteous are examined, as our Father Avinu (Abraham) said about their ultimate state.

Verse 18

<b>Surely</b>. What you have assigned to them is only a temporary extension in this world, to bring them down to the world to come, just as one walks on a smooth path that appears to him as a good way, but with a slight stumble, his feet will falter and he will fall down. Likewise, in this world, their goodness does not endure over time, and even in their death, their goodness does not remain for their children after them. This is what is said in the following verse that follows it.

Verse 19

<b>How</b> All who see them will be astonished at them and will say, "How did they come to such ruin in an instant?"

Verse 20

<b>As a dream when one awakes.</b> Behold, they are like the dream you heard in the summer, where nothing from what you see in the dream can be found. Similarly, the wicked ones, now you will see their prosperity, but now they are no more.
<b>You shall despise their image in the city.</b> My late father, may he rest in peace, explained that in the city, just like in the city of the dead, their image, the image of the wicked, you shall despise, as the scripture says: "Some for eternal life, and some for shame and everlasting contempt." Their image can be interpreted, if desired, in relation to the body or the spirit, just as in our image, resembling us, or in both of them. 

Verse 21

<b>When.</b> Before I understood, my heart was filled with sourness in this matter, like the sourness of wine vinegar. In other words, I couldn't find anything sweet and pleasant in my heart to relieve me from the great distress.
<b>and I was pricked in my reins.</b> It is missing the letter "Bet" in the usage. He said, "And in my kidneys as well, which were advising and deliberating on this matter."
<b> Sharpened / pricked.</b> I was with them in a continuous cycle, engaging in dialogue and exchanging words between me and my children.

Verse 22

<b>then I was foolish</b>Before I understood, I was ignorant, and that person is one without knowledge, just as the Creator formed the beast....
<b>I was like a beast before Thee.</b> I served you, for I did not know if there is a reward or not.

Verse 23

<b>But I am continually with Thee:</b> And as I am always with you, devoted to you and engaged in your service, I diligently pursued wisdom, which helped me understand what it is. This is what it says:
<b>Thou holdest my right hand.</b>You have helped me and sustained me.

Verse 24

<b>with Thy counsel.</b> And as you have helped me in this, and guided me with your counsel, so may you always guide me with your counsel and teach me all the days of my life.
<b>and afterwards receive me to honourable state.</b> To part ways with life and let honor remain.
<b>To recieve me.</b> The translation of the phrase is as follows: "In other words, gather my honor to You; and the word 'other' is not attached to honor, and the melody separates between them. Therefore, it should be interpreted separately."
<b>Afterwards.</b> After my death.
<b>To recieve me.</b> Take my honor that illuminates the soul.

Verse 25

<b>Whom.</b> In the possession of false beliefs, there are those who believe in the sun or in one of the stars, but I have no desire except in You alone. I have not placed a partner for You, neither in heaven nor on earth.
<b>upon earth.</b> By the four elements, I mean that there are servants: water, air, and also earth.

Verse 26

<b>Fail.</b> When my remaining portion, which is announced, will come to an end, and my heart will cease, it is the living soul that is in the heart of every living creature.
<b>the strength of my heart</b>He (G-d) will not cease, and it is the existence of the heart, for the actions of the intellect will operate within it, and it is the form of my heart and my parts, which will be the Eternal G-d, for behold, my parts will be eternal because I have cleaved to you, but those who are far from you will perish

Verse 27

<b>Thou hast destroyed all those who go astray from Thee</b> Every wanderer from your paths shall be united with a sign, so that he shall not have a share in you after the death of the body.


Verse 28

<b>But as for me</b> The wicked are far away, and therefore they will perish. But I, who am near to God, have a good reward waiting for me. I will eagerly await your proximity, which brings good reward in this world and in you, my two refuges. Teach me to comprehend all your deeds, meaning all your actions, so that I may know and be able to recount and understand through the wisdom of nature, which is the knowledge of all your lower and higher physical actions. From there, I will ascend to know your deeds, and then I will attain sublime knowledge.

Good [It is good to praise the Name]: The Sabbath Day is better for praising the Name than the other days of the week.  For one is free of the business of the world and one's spirit rests from physical troubles.   The spirit occupies itself in Wisdom and the service of God.  And it is good to say [praise] to your name, O Exalted one.  For the exalted soul finds an opportunity to praise You, who are Exalted.

Verse 1

LET US GO: This is what Israel is saying to each other in the days of the Messiah, to sing to the Lord that redeemed them. And we have already explained that “lechu” are words of ziruz (alacrity/enthusiasm) in the action, not literally walking.

FORTY [years] that they angered me from the matter with the Spies until I said that they would remain in the desert for forty years. אקוט means “I saw them rebel”, and בדור refers to the generation of the desert.
The mistake of their hearts and their hearts are negative so they didn't believe in Me.
They did not recognize all the miracles that I made for them, and they feared entering the Land. They did not trust in me. Therefore I swore that they would not enter there [Israel] and and die in the desert from 20 years and up.

1 "because [they defied the statements of God, spurned the intent of the Most High]."  [The Psalmist] informed them that they were taken captive on account of their iniquity, for they had "defied the statements/'imrei of God," which refers to the precepts that He had commanded to humanity.  It was not to Israel alone that commandments were issued, but also to all peoples.  He distinguished Israel from the (other) nations by commanding them concerning additional precepts, sanctifying them through the purity of body and food.  However, traditional precepts were granted to the first Man and his progeny (i.e., the Seven Noachide Laws).  These are "the statements of God."

Verse 1

There are manuscripts [of the book of Psalms] in which this verse [115:1] is not the beginning of the psalm. [In other words, those manuscripts join together Psalms 114 and 115.]. [The Psalmist] said that, just as You have performed acts of lovingkindness for our ancestors by taking them out of Egypt, so may you do for us in every generation.  Even though we are not worthy, do not do so 'for us' (115:1) but for your Name's sake.  For they [the generation of the Exodus] likewise would not have been worthy had it not been for the glory of Your name and [Your] covenant with the Fathers.  He says "not for our sake" twice in order to emphasize the point.

[Adonai] is good to all.  He is good and merciful even to wild animals, domesticated animals, and fowl.  And so it is fitting for a person to follow these ways of His.  One should not destroy life other than for a need or to guard oneself from dangers.  So we find that our Holy Master (Rabbi Judah the Prince, editor of the Mishnah) bade his handmaiden not to sweep up mice with household embers.  Rather, she should let them live in the cellar.  He said to her, "It is written, 'His mercy is upon all His works.'"

<b>The storm wind executing His word:</b> That is the air that blows. And when it blows strongly, it knocks over tall cedars, buildings and ships on the sea.

Rather He commands it to blow, and it is by His word and His commandment that it blows, to punish those that encounter [it].
