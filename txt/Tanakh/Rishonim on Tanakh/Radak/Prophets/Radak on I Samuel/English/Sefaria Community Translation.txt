Radak on I Samuel



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>And there was (<i>Vayehi</i>) a man from Ramatayim of the Tzufites:</b> We have already written at the beginning of the book of Yehoshua that the you will find that the [letter,] <i>vav</i> (usually meaning, and), is customary in the Hebrew language at the beginning of things, and likewise in the language of Yishmael (Arabic). And we also wrote about the grammar of the word, <i>yehi</i>, there.
<b>From Ramatayim:</b> Our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed wrote, they were two tall (<i>ramot</i>) mountains, viewing (<i>tzofot</i>) one another. And if so - that they were two mountains, and the word indicates so, since it is an expression of duality - the explanation of, "from the two tall mountains," would be, from one of the two tall mountains. This is like, "and he was buried in the hills of Gilead" (Judges 12:4); "with two can you be my son-in-law" (I Samuel 18:21), and that which is similar to them. And the meaning of Tzufites, is that it is [speaking] about the high mountains, as we explained. But Tzufites can [also] be explained as prophets. And the, "from," that it mentioned is in the place of two, as if to [also] say from the family of Tzufites. And so did Yonatan translate it [in the Targum], "from the students of the prophets." As a prophet is [also] called a <i>tzofeh</i> (seer or scout), as in, "I have given you as a <i>tzofeh</i>" (Ezekiel 33:7).  And this is the correct explanation,  since he was from a family of priests. For he was from the sons of Korach, as his lineage is detailed in Chronicles; and the sons of Korach were prophets - Asir, Elkanah and Aviasaf. And Elkanah, the father of Shmuel, was from the descendants of Elkanah, the son of Korach.
<b>From Mount Ephraim:</b> He was a Levite and lived in the Land of Ephraim. And it is possible that it is for this reason that the story of the concubine at Givea was made adjacent to this story about the matter of Elkanah and the proceedings of Shmuel. For [the protagonist in the other story] also lived in the foothills of Mount Ephraim and he was the cause of much evil to Israel; whereas this one was the cause of great goodness to Israel - and his son, Shmuel, brought Israel back to the proper path. 
<b>An Efrati:</b>. This is said about two facets. The one relates to the tribe, concerning one who is from the tribe of Ephraim, or someone who lives in the Land of Ephraim - as in, "Are you an Efrati" (Judges 12:5). And the [other] relates to Beit Lechem-Efrat - as in, "and David was an Efrati" (I Samuel 17:12); "Machlon and Khiliyon were Efrati" (Ruth 1:2). And this concerns Mount Ephraim, as it stated (here), "from Mount Ephraim." And that is why, it called him an Efrati. For we can not explain that he was an Efrati concerning the tribe of Ephraim, since he was a Levite. If so, that which it stated, "an Efrati," is that he was from Mount Ephraim. But it is a wonder - after it stated, "from Mount Ephraim," why did it state, "an Efrati," afterwards? And it is possible that it also said it because he and his forefathers lived there. So it stated, "Efrati," about Tzuf, not about Elkanah. For it already explained about Elkanah, "from Mount Ephraim." This is correct, according to the simple understanding. And that which it stated that he and his forefathers had lived in Mount Ephraim appears to be because their inheritance was there, as they were from the sons of Kehat. And the sons of Kehat had cities in Mount Ephraim, as it stated in the book of Yehoshua (Joshua 21:20), "And to the sons of Kehat, the Levites, etc. Shechem and its fields on Mount Ephraim." But the homiletical teaching explains it as an expression of greatness and importance:
<b>Efrati:</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, "Noble." And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "a man who was distinguished by holiness on the Mountain of the House of Ephraim."

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>And he went up:</b> So would he do every year, as he would go up to Shiloh to sacrifice. And that which it stated, "from his city," is to say that he would encourage the people of his city to go up. And in the homiletical teachings - he would not go next year the way that he went this year, but would rather go a different way each year in order to make Israel know [about this] and to bring them up to Shiloh. 
<b>Year by year (lit., from days to days):</b> From year to year, as in, "And you shall keep this statute in its time, from days to days" (Exodus 13:10). Or (alternatively), its explanation is from the set time to the set time; and likewise Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "from the time of the set time to the set time." 
<b>To bow down and to sacrifice:</b> To pray before the Lord and to sacrifice the sacrifice of the holiday there. And in the homiletical teachings: Rabbi Elah in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak, "Prayer is equal to the sacrifices, as it is stated, 'to bow down and to sacrifice.'" But the Sages say, "Prayer is more beloved than all of the sacrifices, as it is [first] written, 'to bow down,' and afterwards, 'to sacrifice.'"
<b>And the sons of Eli were there:</b> It mentioned them concerning the sacrifices, on account of what it will mention in the future about them, that which they would do with the sacrifices.

Verse 4

<b>And it was on that day:</b> The day of the set time; and likewise did Yonatan translate it [in the Targum] as, "the day of the set time." And in the homiletical teachings: Rabbi Yehoshua be Levi said, "This was the day of Shavuot."
<b>And he would give to Peninah</b> from the peace-offerings that he would sacrifice. 

Verse 5

<b>But to Hannah he would give (lit., he will give):</b> It is like, he gave - like (other examples of the future tense indicating the past), "Then Yehoshua will build" (Joshua 8:30); "Then Moshe will separate" (Deuteronomy 4:41).
<b>One portion, <i>apayim</i> (face)":</b> One distinguished portion to assuage her rage and her anger. And likewise, "long of face (<i>arekh apayim</i>)," is long to anger. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "a choice portion" - meaning to say, a portion fitting to be received with a joyful face. And in the homiletical teachings: What is "face?" For the falling of the face, with a pleasant face. Face corresponding to Peninah and her children. But my master, my father, may his memory be blessed, explained <i>apayim</i> as anger. That is to say, he would give her only one portion in anger, because God, may He be blessed, sealed her womb, and she did not have children for him to give portions to her, like with the children of Peninah. He was angry and sad about this, since he loved Channah and desired to have children from her.
<b>But the Lord had closed her womb:</b> Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "She was prevented from having a child before God. " 

Verse 6

<b>Her rival (<i>tzarah</i>):</b> Peninah, who was a tribulation (<i>tzarah</i>) to her. And likewise, all two wives [married] to the same man are called tribulations (<i>tzarot</i>), since they are generally each other's enemies. And likewise in the Mishnah (Yevamot 1), "exempt their <i>tzarot</i>."
<b>Very much anger:</b> One anger after another. She would say things [that cause] anger, since she did not have children. And in the homiletical teachings: She would anger [her] and anger [her] again. What would she say to her? "Did you buy your older son a cloak today, or your younger son, a shirt?" 
<b>So that she should <i>harraeim</i>:</b> From [the same usage as] (Ezekiel 27:35), "<i>raamu panim</i> (contorted [their] faces)." And the [letter], <i>reish</i>, in <i>harraeimah</i> is accented, against the rules, to strengthen the reading - as with the <i>kof</i> in (Judges 20:13), "<i>netakkenhu</i> (we shall draw them) from the city," and others that are accented for the beauty of the reading. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, <i>harraeimah</i>, as "to make her jealous." Meaning to say, in order that she would be jealous, she would say things about childraising in front of her and that which is similar, so that she would be jealous and her heart would ache.
Before (<i>be'ad</i>) her womb: Upon her womb, like (Joel 2:8), "before they fell before (<i>be'ad</i>) the loopholes"; (Leviticus 16:6), "and atoned before (<i>be'ad</i>) him" (in both of these cases, <i>be'ad</i> means, upon).  

Verse 7

<b>And as he would do this:</b> Elkanah would do this every year, to go up to the House of the Lord with his household. And Peninah would also anger Channah each time when she would go up to the House of the Lord, since she would anger her about the matter of the portions - that there were portions for her and her children, whereas Channah only had one portion since she did not have children who would take portions. 

Verse 8

<b>Am I not:</b> It is like the Targum [Yonatan], "Is not my wish better to you" - meaning to say, "Is not my wish towards you and my love for you better to you than ten sons?" But some explain, "Am I not better to you than I am to the ten sons I have from Peninah" - meaning to say, I love you more than I love my sons. And he said this because Peninah had ten sons. But according to our explanation, the reason for [the word], "ten," is by way of a general (figurative) count - as in (Leviticus 26:26), "and ten women will bake"; "than ten rulers" (Ecclesiastes 7:19); "seven times like your sins" (Leviticus 26:21); "seven times does a righteous one fall" (Proverbs 24:16); and that which is similar to them. 

Verse 9

<b>Eating (<i>Achlah</i>):</b> It is the infinitive with the addition of a <i>hey</i>; but the <i>hey</i> is not for the feminine, as it is not dotted (<i>mapik</i>). And likewise, drinking (<i>shatah</i>) is the infinitive. So its explanation is that they ate and they drank. But it is possible that Channah also ate. Even though it stated (I Shmuel 1:7), "and she wept and would not eat," it is possible that after her husband said to her, "But why don't you eat," and pleaded with her, she ate a little. And a master of homiletical teachings said (Ketuvot 65a), "'He drank (<i>shatah</i>),' but she did not drink (<i>shatatah</i>). But he was not exact.  
<b>And Eli the priest was sitting on the seat upon (<i>al</i>) the doorpost of (<i>mezuzat</i>) the chamber of the Lord:</b> The explanation [of, "upon,"] is close to the doorposts. For the doorposts (<i>mezuzat</i>) are the sides of the gates, not the lintel. And likewise (Numbers 2:20), "And upon it, the tribe of Menashe," is, close to it; "and sacrifice upon it" (Exodus 20:21), is, close to it. And likewise did Yonatan translate it [in the Targum] as, "at the side of the gate of the chamber of the Lord." And there are some of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, who said that not even the kings of the House of David may sit in the [Temple] courtyard - only the high priest - as it is stated, "And Eli the priest was sitting on the seat upon (<i>al</i>) the doorpost." And the explanation of, "And [...] David came and sat before the Lord," is that he sat himself down to pray [elsewhere]. And our Rabbis expounded (Seder Olam 13) - sitting (<i>yoshev</i>) is lacking a [letter,] <i>vav</i> (making the default reading,  <i>yashav</i>, in the past). So they said, it is written, "he sat" - teaching that they appointed him high priest that day.

Verse 10

<b>So she prayed upon (<i>al</i>) the Lord:</b> It is like, to (<i>el</i>) the Lord. Likewise (Isaiah 29:11-12), "And he gave the book upon someone who [...] knows books," is like, to someone; (II Kings 22:8) "upon Shafan," is like to Shafan.

Verse 11

<b>And she made a vow:</b> I wonder how her vow attached itself upon her son, such that he be a nazerite? Moreover, he was not in the world, so how could the vow attach itself to him? And even if he was in the world, behold they said (Sotah 3:8), "A man can vow that his son be a nazirite, but a woman cannot vow that her son be a nazirite!" And even with a man, they did not find a reason, but rather said it is a law [transmitted without explanation] in the case of a nazerite. And if you would say that Elkanah also made the vow after he heard [it] from his wife - we have not seen this! And how did the verse leave out the main vow and write the vow of Channah, which is not a [true] vow? That is remote. And I wonder [even] more how our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, did not say anything about this thing. For I did not find anything at all about this in their words, not in the Midrash and not in the Talmud. 
<b>O Lord of hosts:</b> Our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded - since until then, we did not find one person who called the Lord, the Lord of Hosts. For what it stated above (I Samuel 1:3), "to the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh," is the narrative from the writer of the book. Hence they said, "Why did this name come specifically here? Channah said before the Holy One, blessed be He, 'You created two hosts in Your world. The heavenly beings neither multiply nor do they die; the earthly beings multiply and die. If I am of the earthly beings, let me multiply, and if I am of the heavenly beings, let me not die." And our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, also said, "Rav said, 'The steps of the pilgrims were going up. Channah said before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Master of the worlds, From all of these masses that you have before You, can you not remember me with one of them?"'"
<b>If You will surely look (lit., look, you will look):</b> They expounded because of the doubling (of the word, look). But it is not necessary, for this is the way of the language, to join the infinitive with verbs, like (Jeremiah 17:24), "if you will surely listen (lit., listen, you will listen). And it said [it], because this combination is to strengthen the matter. And they, may their memory be blessed, expounded about it (Berakhot 31b), "If You will look, fine; but if not, You will look: I will go and have Elkanah, my husband, be jealous of me, and I will give birth, as You have written in Your Torah, (Numbers 5:28), 'But if the woman was not defiled and she is pure [... and shall bear seed].'"
<b>Upon the affliction of your maidservant:</b> [The word, "your maidservant," appears] three times in the verse; like [Noach, in] "These are the generations of Noach" (Genesis 6:9); and Israel, five times, in the verse (Numbers 8:19). For this is the way of the Scriptures, to embellish. But they expounded about it (Pesikta Rabbati 43:1) - Channah said, "A woman is commanded with three commandments, and I have not transgressed [even] one of them."
<b>And You will remember me and not forget your maidservant:</b> The repetition is to strengthen the prayer and the request. And likewise (Deuteronomy 25:17-18), "Remember that which Amalek did to you [...] do not forget," is to strengthen the commandment. And our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Pesikta Rabbati 43:1), "'And You will remember me,' with males; 'and not forget your maidservant,' with females."
<b>The offspring of men:</b> Its explanation is males; and that which it stated, "and a razor shall never come on his head," shows that she said it about males. For this is not said about females. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "a son amidst people." And in the homiletical teachings: The offspring of men, that their faces not be similar to a monkey, nor to a eunuch. Another explanation - the offspring of men, wise men, as you say (Deuteronomy 1:13), "wise and understanding men"; men, prophets, as you say (Numbers 11:26), "And two men remained." And they also said, offspring that is equivalent to two men. And who were they? Moshe and Aharon, as it is stated (Psalms 99:6), "Moshe and Aharon among His priests, and Shmuel among those who call His name."
<b>Then I will give him to the Lord:</b> That he should be a holy nazirite before the Lord. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "and I will give him over to serve before the Lord." But if it is like his words, what did Channah give to Him; are not all Levites given to the Lord? We can [however] explain that the other Levites would come to the service of the Lord from twenty-five years old, whereas she gave him to the Lord "all his days." And in the homiletical teachings: They said to Channah, "Why are you requesting the offspring of wise men, the offspring of prophetical men?" She said to them, "So that he be suitable to give him to the Lord." 
<b>And a <i>morah</i>:</b> It is a razor, like (Judges 13:5), "And no razor (<i>morah</i>) shall come upon his head," about Shimshon. But Yonatan translated the one about Shimshon [in the Targum], "razor," and this one, "and there shall be no fear of people upon him." And its content, according to his opinion, is like it would be with an <i>alef</i> [at the end of the word, instead of a <i>hey</i>]. And there is a disagreement about this in the words of our Rabbis (Nazir 9:5): Rabbi Nehorai says, "Shmuel was a nazirite, as it is stated, 'and no <i>morah</i> shall come upon his head.' Just as that which is stated with regard to Shimson [means he was] a nazirite, so too <i>morah</i> that is stated with regard to Shmuel [means he was]  a nazirite." Rabbi Yose said, "<i>Morah</i> means nothing other than [the fear of] flesh and blood." [Rabbi Yosef said, "Like whom do we translate, 'and there shall be no fear of people upon him?' Like whom? Like Rabbi Yose."] And in the homiletical teaching, it explains why a razor is called a <i>morah</i>: Rabbi Ammi said, "'The fear <i>yirat</i>of worm and snail will not come there' (Isaiah 7:25) - just as this stalk only fears iron, so too does this hair only fear iron."

Verse 12

<b>And as she kept on:</b> In the homiletical teachings (Talmud Yerushalmi Berakhot 4:1): Rebbi Levi said [that] Rabbi Shimon [said] in the name of Rabbi Chalafta and in the name of Rabbi Meir, "From here, [we learn that] everyone who increases his prayers will be answered." The position of Rabbi Meir is inverted. There Rabbi Abbahu, the son of Rabbi Pappai and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sakhnin in the name of Rebbi Levi say, "'In all excitement there is something superfluous; and the word of the lips is but for deficit' (Proverbs 14:23) - Hannah, because she prayed too long, reduced the years of Samuel. As it is stated (I Samuel 1:22), 'He shall dwell there forever'; and 'forever,' for a Levite is only fifty years, as it is written (Numbers 8:25), 'And from age fifty, [he should return, etc.].'" Yet he was fifty-two! Rabbi Yose bar Bun said, "[That was because of the] two [years until] she weaned him."
<b>Watched (<i>shomer</i>) her mouth:</b> He watched and analyzed her mouth - what was this long prayer? He did not hear her voice, "only her lips moved." Therefore he thought her to be drunk. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, <i>shomer</i>, like, await - as in (Genesis 37:11), "he  <i>shamar</i> the thing"; (Job 14:16), "and not <i>tishmor</i> my sin." And the explanation of, "her mouth," is like her utterance and her speech. And likewise did Yonatan translate it as, "and he waited for her until she ceased."

Verse 13

<b>Spoke in her heart:</b> It is like its translation [in Targum Yonatan], "she prayed in her heart." Meaning to say, she concentrated [with] her heart in prayer.

Verse 14

<b>Will you be drunk:</b> Until when will you show yourself as if you were drunk; since you move the lips of your mouth, but your words are not heard. 
<b>Remove your wine:</b> And sober up, since you appear like a drunkard and you do not act like other people who pray, who say their requests in a way that you can hear. And even though sometimes someone who prays says his words a little secretly, nevertheless he also yells out and prays some of his words. But you proceeded to pray so much, yet your voice was not heard. And from this, it appears that you are drunk. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "Until when will you act foolishly; will you not temper the wine from yourself?" 

Verse 15

<b>No, my lord:</b> I am not drunk, as you think. Rather, "I am a woman of a troubled spirit" - my spirit is troubled about me, from my great distress. And the construct form (<i>smikhut</i>) [of, "a troubled spirit"] is like, "of fallen leaves" (Isaiah 1:30); "of shaven beards" (Jeremiah 41:5); of torn clothes" (II Samuel 13:31). 
<b>Wine nor strong drink:</b>  It is like its translation [in Targum Yonatan], "new wine and old." And likewise is it said in the homiletical teachings - wine is new and strong drink (<i>shekhar</i>) is old [wine]. But it is likely to be explained, <i>shekhar</i> is that which is made from [other] fruits.
<b>But I have been pouring out my soul</b> with much prayer. It was as if she poured out her soul - like (Psalms 62:9), "they poured their hearts before Him." And Yonatan translated it as, "and she said, 'My soul is humbled in prayer before the Lord.'"

Verse 16

<b>As (lit., before) an unbridled woman:</b> Before the Lord, as an unbridled woman. Meaning to say, do not think that I would stand drunk like an evil woman in front of the Lord, may He be blessed. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "Do not embarrass your maidservant before an evil woman." It appears from his words that she said, "unbridled woman," about Peninah, her rival. So she said to him, "Do not embarrass me in front of her, for she will rejoice at my misfortune, and she angers me." And the understanding of, "Do not place," is do not place me in this bad thing - do not embarrass me with it in front of this woman that is unbridled. And this explanation is correct.
<b>For it is out of the greatness of my grievance and my anger:</b> It is like its translation [in Targum Yonatan], "because of the abundance of my provocations and my anger did I prolong my prayer until now." Meaning to say, it is from the abundance that I have to speak before God [of] provocations that my rival provokes and angers me that I spoke in front of the Lord, may He be blessed, until now.

Verse 17

<b>May [the Lord] grant what you have asked:</b> The [letter,] <i>alef</i> is missing (in <i>shelatekh</i>) and its movement is placed upon the <i>shin</i>. As its rule (it usual spelling) is [with an <i>alef</i>]. And its explanation is that it is in the way of a prayer. Or he said it in the way of prophecy, for he was a prophet. So he said to her, "Go in peace," because "the Lord of Israel will grant you what you asked." Hence her heart was gladdened and she ate, for she hoped [about the fulfillment of] the words of the prophet. And she said, "May your maidservant find favor in your eyes" - in the way of (Ruth 2:13), "May I find favor in the eyes of my master, since you have comforted me." But according to the first explanation, the explanation would be, may your maidservant find favor in your eyes, that you should still pray more for me. And hence her heart was gladdened and she ate, since she thought that Eli's prayer would be effective for her. And in the homiletical teachings, it appears that he spoke in the way of prophecy: He said to her, "Go in peace" - he said to her, "This peace is from me; however your peace is from your children."  
<b>And may the God of Israel grant what you have asked (<i>shelatekh</i>):</b> It is written, <i>shaltekh</i> - he said to her, "This son that you will establish in the future will capture much booty (<i>lishlol harbeh shelal</i>) from the Torah.

Verse 18

<b>On her way:</b> She went to her home and ate. It appears that she had not eaten with her husband; or it is possible that she ate a little when her husband had pleaded. But now her heart was gladdened and she ate. And in the homiletical teachings: What is, "on her way" - that she began to menstruate, like (Genesis 31:35), "since the way of women is with me."
<b>And her face:</b> She no longer had a [long] face. And likewise did Yonatan translate [in the Targum], "and a bad face." 

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>As the cycles and days passed:</b> The days of her pregnancy - like its translation [in Targum Yonatan], "at the time of the completion of the days." And the explanation of, "and Channah conceived," is that she had already conceived. For when they returned from Shiloh, Elkanah, her husband, knew her intimately; and she conceived - as it is written [in the previous verse], "and the Lord remembered her." "The cycles and days" - that is when the days of pregnancy were completed, she gave birth to a son. And there are [instances of the letter,] <i>vav</i> [such as at the beginning of this verse] like this, indicating the past - like (Isaiah 64:4), "indeed, You were angry and we sinned" (the <i>vav</i> here changes the second phrase from being future to being past); (Exodus 14:21) "and the waters were split" (the <i>vav</i> here too changing the future to past); and those similar to them. And our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said that the days of her pregnancy were six months and two days - the minimum of "cycles" is two, and the minimum of "days" is two; and a cycle is three months. And we learn from this [that] a woman who gives birth in her seventh month can give birth with cut off (partial) [months].  
<b>Shmuel:</b> This word is constructed for this reason from, "I requested him from the Lord." As there are the letters of, <i>shaul</i> (requested), in Shmuel, and there are also the letters of, <i>me'El</i> (from God). It as is if she said, "Requested from God."
<b>For I requested him from the Lord:</b> It is lacking the word, said. Meaning to say, why did she call his name Shmuel? Because she said, "I requested him from the Lord." And it is like the Targum Yonatan, "For I said, 'I requested him before the Lord.'"  

Verse 21

<b>And all his household (lit., house):</b> It is like its translation [in Targum Yonatan], "And all the people of his house."
<b>The annual sacrifice (lit., of the days):</b> It is like its translation [in Targum Yonatan], "the sacrifice of the appointed time."
<b>And his vow:</b> [He went up] to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice that he was accustomed to sacrificing and the sacrifice of the appointed time as of yore, but he also went up to sacrifice his vow-offering. For he had vowed a sacrifice to the Lord for his son. And so did Yonatan translate [in the Targum], "and to fulfill his vow."  

Verse 22

<b>Until the boy will be weaned:</b> Until the end of his nursing, and that is the twenty-four months  that an infant nurses. And even though they were obligated to bring him [to Shiloh] on account of, "every male shall appear" (Exodus 23:17) - our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said it was because she saw that he was pampered and weak, so she was concerned lest he fall sick because of the travel. 
<b>And he shall abide there forever:</b> As she had vowed about him, "and I will give him to the Lord" (I Samuel 1:11). And the explantion of, "forever," is all the days of his life. And our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded - the forever of the Levites, since they would serve fifty years, as it is written (Numbers 8:25), "From the age of fifty he shall retire from the work force." And they said that all the days of Shmuel were only fifty-two years: As Channah had already said, "and I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life." And she said, "And he shall abide there forever" - and that is the forever of the Levites, which is fifty years. And from when he came to the House of the Lord until the day of his death was fifty years. And the [other] two years were when he nursed, as it is written, "until the boy will be weaned." And it is the way of a child to nurse twenty-four months. There you have fifty-two years.

Verse 23

<b>May the Lord fulfill His word:</b> The verses show that what Eli said (I Samuel 1:17), "May (the Lord) grant what you have asked," was by way of prophecy - that the Lord would grant her what she asked. And behold what she asked was that she should have offspring of men and that he should be for the Lord. Hence [Elkanah] said, "May the Lord fulfill His word" - the explanation of which is, that which he spoke through the prophet, that He will grant you what you asked. And that is a son that will live and who will be for the Lord. And in the homiletical teachings: "But may the Lord fulfill His word" - every day, a heavenly voice would come out and clamor in the world and say, "In the future, a righteous one will arise, and his name is Shmuel." So every woman who would give birth to a son, would bring out his name as Shmuel. Once they saw his deeds, they would say, "This is not Shmuel." When this one was born and they saw his deeds, they said, "It appears that this is he." And that is what is written, "May the Lord fulfill His word" 

Verse 24

<b>With three bulls:</b> Some of them to eat and some of them to slaughter to the Lord. And likewise, "one <i>ephah</i> of flour," to eat and to offer a grain-offering from it; and likewise, "and a jar of wine," to drink and to pour [a libation] from it. Hence it stated (I Samuel 1:25), "And they slaughtered the bull," and it did not say, "the bulls" - meaning to say, the bull that they offered to the Lord. 
<b>And the lad was a lad:</b> Meaning to say, the lad was still a small and delicate lad. Yet, in spite of this, she did not wait for him until he became stronger, but rather once she weaned him - meaning to say, when she completed his nursing at the end of twenty-four months [from] when he was born - she brought him up immediately with her to the House of the Lord. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "and the lad was a <i>yanik</i>." But this does not mean that he was still nursing (<i>yonek</i>). For behold, it states, "when she weaned him" - when she finished nursing him. Rather <i>yanik</i> means to say, a young lad. For this is the way of Aramaic, they call a lad a <i>yanik</i> - as we have found in the words of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, "a <i>yanik</i> who is wise"; "the <i>yanuka</i> master and the old master." But some explain, "and the lad was a lad (<i>naar</i>) is [that] he was sharp and knew [the difference] between good and evil, like a shaker (<i>menaer</i>), who shakes off the waste from the flax.   

Verse 25

<b>They brought the boy:</b> After they slaughtered the bull for a sacrifice, Elkanah and Channah brought the boy to the House of the Lord to Eli, to reside and study before him; and that [Eli] should educate him about all the Torah and the commandment[s]. And there is no reason to write the homiletical teaching, as it is well-known and it is remote.

Verse 26

<b>Please, my lord: </b> It is a matter of a supplication and a request - like its translation [in Targum Yonatan], "please, my master" - as you live, that you should keep your eyes upon this lad and teach him, for "I am the woman" who prayed to the Lord.
<b>With you:</b> Meaning to say, before you and in your presence - as you were there when I prayed. And I prayed for this lad and the Lord granted me what I asked, as you proclaimed to me. And the [letter,] <i>hey</i> [at the end of the word, <i>imcha</i> (with you)] is like the <i>hey</i> in (Jeremiah 29:25), "that you sent books in your name"; (Exodus 13:16) "and they will be a sign upon your hand"; and those that are similar to it. As leave it alone - sometimes it is written and sometimes it is not written. And there is a homiletical teaching about it - from here, [we learn about] the four cubits of prayer. 

Verse 27

<b>To (<i>el</i>) the boy:</b> For the boy.

Verse 28

<b>I lent him:</b> I returned the loan to Him that He gave me. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "I gave him over, that he should serve before the Lord."
<b>That he was (lived):</b> It is like, that he would be. And there are many [cases] like this.
<b>He is lent (<i>shaul</i>):</b> It is like, given - meaning to say, he who was lent is now truly given to the Lord. And there is a homiletical teaching about it: At that time, the holy spirit blossomed in her, and she said, "All the time that Shmuel is alive, Saul is alive." And that is [the meaning of] that which it is written, "<i>shaul</i> to the Lord."
<b>And he bowed down:</b> Elkanah, like someone getting permission to leave the House of the Lord. Or the explanation of, "And he bowed down," is Shmuel - even though he was only two years old, they taught him to bow down to the Lord. 

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>And Channah prayed and said:</b> She prayed before the Lord and gave Him praise and thanksgiving for the son that He gave her. And she prayed to the Lord that he would live and that he would be for the Lord. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "And Channah prayed with a spirit of prophecy and said, 'Shmuel, my son, will be a prophet over Israel in the future, etc.'" And Yonatan also translated this song [to be] about the kings of the nations of the world and about the congregation of Israel. And about the verse, "There is no holy one like the Lord" (I Samuel 2:2), he said, "About Sancheriv, the king of Assyria, she prophesied and said." And about the verse, "Do not abound with speech" (I Samuel 2:3), he said, "About Nevuchadnetzar, the king of Babylonia, she prophesied and said." And about the verse, "The bows of the mighty are broken" (I Samuel 2:4), he said, "About the kingdom of Antiochus, she prophesied and said." And about the verse, "The sated, for bread" (I Samuel 2:5), he said, "About the sons of Haman, she prophesied and said." And about the verse, "The Lord kills, and gives life" (I Samuel 2:6) until, "O Lord, may His adversaries be shattered" (I Samuel 2:10), he spoke about the reward of the righteous in the Garden of Eden and the punishment of the wicked in Geihinnom. And in the verse, "O Lord, may His adversaries be shattered," she spoke [about] the judgement of Gog and Magog and the kingdom of our Messiah. But according to the simple meaning, Channah opened this song, with regards to those tranquil in the world and the proud ones; and about the humble ones of the earth and the lowly ones - that the Holy One, blessed be He, sees everything. So 'He brings down the proud and raises the lowly' - like the thing that was upon her and upon Peninah, her rival.
<b>My heart exults in the Lord:</b> My heart, that had been sad, now exults and rejoices; and my horn, that had been lowly - since I had no cause to raise my head before my rival - is now exalted.
<b>My horn is exalted:</b> The attacker is called, a horn, since it is the highest place on a beast. It is also that the horns of a wild animal attack, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 33:17), "through them, nations are gored." And in a man, it is by way of a metaphor; and it is as if it said, "My head is high" - as it is stated (Psalms 27:6), "And now, my head will be raised over my enemies." And all of this is "through the Lord," who helped me.
<b>My mouth is enlarged:</b> [The accent] is in the front, because it is a small word.
<b>Over my enemies:</b> Over Peninah and over those who angered me when I was barren.
<b>In Your salvation:</b> As You saved me from my rival and granted me a son.

Verse 2

<b>There is no holy one like the Lord:</b> Since I prayed in His Holy House and my prayer was heard.
<b>For there is none beside You:</b> I have known that "there is none beside You," to whom it is suitable to pray. And hence, I must say, "There is no holy one like the Lord."
<b>And there is no rock like our God:</b> There is no one strong like our God, who changes natures according to His will. For I had been barren and it was not my nature to give birth. 

Verse 3

<b>Do not abound:</b> Regarding Peninah and regarding those who angered her, she said, "Do not abound in speaking uppity things." 
<b>Come out:</b> Do not let [it] come out. The [one], "do not," that it mentioned, serves in the place of two. ("Do not" only actually appears at the beginning of the verse, and not before this phrase). 
<b>Arrogance (<i>atak</i>):</b> A strong thing. 
<b>For the Lord is a God of knowledge (lit., knowledges or minds):</b> He knows everything and there is nothing hidden from Him. And she said, "minds," in the plural - meaning to say, He knows all the minds of people like one, without [there being] multiplicity and without change in Him. It is like it stated (Psalms 33:15), "He who fashions the hearts of them all, who discerns all their doings."
<b>And by Him (<i>lo</i>) actions (<i>alilot</i>) are measured:</b> <i>Lo</i> is written with a [letter,] <i>alef</i> (making it, not), but read with a <i>vav</i> (making it, to Him). And the explanation of what is written is - since the actions of people are not measured up if God does not desire [it]. And the explantion of what is read out is that actions are measured only by Him, and not by a person. For He does according to what He desires, whereas a man 'says but does not do, speaks but does not fulfil.' And the explanation of <i>alilot</i> is deeds. 

Verse 4

<b>The bow of the mighty ones are broken:</b> The understanding of broken is that is referring to the mighty, not to the bow. For it would have [otherwise] have had to say, "is broken." And the explanation of broken is [that it is referring to both] them and their bows. And like this is (II Samuel 10:9), "the face of war was upon him" (face in Hebrew is plural and war is singular; "was," referring to war); (Job 29:10), "The voice of princes were hushed"  ("were hushed," referring to princes); and the [cases] similar to them that we wrote in the Sefer Mikhlol.  
<b>Girded with strength:</b> The strength and the power are girded.

Verse 5

<b>The sated must hire out for bread:</b> Those who were sated at the beginning became hungry, to the point that they must hire themselves out to work for the sake of bread. And those who were hungry at the beginning and hired themselves out, stopped hiring themselves out and exerting themselves. For they became sated through the will of the Creator, may He be blessed, until the will of the Creator came to this. And the providence is to the point that someone who was barren like me gave birth to seven; and one who was the mother of many like my rival, Peninah, is now forlorn [and] cut off - meaning to say that her sons died. And that which she said, "seven," is not precise, but rather this is a [general] amount. As this is the way of Scripture - when it wants to say, many, it says, seven, as in (Jeremiah 15:9), "Forlorn is the one who gave birth to seven"; (Leviticus 26:21) "seven times like your sins"; (Proverbs 24:16) "seven times does a righteous one fall and arise." As the world is with seven - seven planets, seven days of the week. And Channah said this about herself, as she had sons and daughters - as it is written (I Samuel 2:22), "For the Lord remembered Channah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters."
<b>And the mother of many:</b> She said this about Peninah. They said that when Channah bore [a child], two of Peninah's children would die. And in the homiletical teachings: "While the barren woman bears seven" - Shmuel is the numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of the number seven (<i>sheva</i>, when it is spelled out). And it is likely to say that Channah said this about the Community of Israel, and all of the song is also about the Community of Israel. And that is why it began with the wording (I Samuel 2:1), "And Channah prayed." As the expression, prayer usually relates to future matters and [only] rarely to what has passed. And she said this with the spirit of prophecy and that is why it was placed in Scripture among the Prophets. For it is all a future prophecy about the troubles of Israel and their salvations, like the translator, Yonatan ben Uzziel, translated. And he said well, and it fits for those that have understanding. But our opinion about this verse and about this whole song is that Channah said that all the matters of the world and the needs of people are dependent on the hands of the Creator, may He blessed, and on His will; and that He supervises the generalities and the specifics and does with them according to His will. And even if it appears to people that He will do something that is not like their will and their desire, they should pray to Him with all their soul, like I did myself. And He will grant them their request and their desire in anything that is their desire and their need. For His providence is upon the earthly ones just like it is on the celestial ones, as she said at the end (II Samuel 2:8), "For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's; He has set the world upon them." And she said that if Israel will be in distress and in exile under the idolaters, who are compared to a woman that has given birth to many children and she lords it over them and is happy and glorifies herself over them at all times when the woman with many children is victorious to distress and cause evil to the barren woman - and that is the Community of Israel, who is compared to the barren woman, since she gives birth to few children, as it appears in Isaiah (54:1), "Rejoice, barren one who has not given birth," and there are many [examples] like this, even though she has a few children - there will still be a time that this barren one will also be the mother of many. [This will be] at the time that they return to God with all their hearts and pray to Him in their exile and their distress. And then the one that was the mother of many will be forlorn, the explantion of which is cut off and ceasing to give birth and to be successful. And those whom she bore will be cut off and lost. And this teaches about the coming of our Messiah, and the matter of the salvation of Israel when we return to our land, speedily in our days; and about the death of those who convene with Gog and Magog, since there will be a big ruckus with them. But the good among Israel will be saved. And about this did she say (II Samuel 2:9), "He guards the steps of His faithful." And all the content follows in this way; and from here, I have opened the way for you and [now] you can understand [it] on your own. 

Verse 6

<b>The Lord kills, and gives life</b> to a man. It first stated, "kills," and afterwards, "gives life,"  the opposite of a living being, who He set up to live and extends his life when He wants. And likewise (Isaiah 38:16), "and heal me and give me life"; and those that are similar to it - the explanation of which is the preservation of life in a person. And "He brings down to the grave and raises up," is likewise like (Psalms 30:4), "You raised my soul from the grave, You gave me life out of those that descended to the pit"; and also (Psalms 49:16), "from the grave, since You took me, Selah." And the understanding of, "from," is above from it and below from it; or it is a hint to troubles and respites. And likewise (Deuteronomy 32:39), "I kill and I give life." Or "He kills, and gives life" - I kill and give life is a hint to the reward of the righteous and to the punishment of the wicked, to their souls. Or it stated this verse in the way of prophecy or in the way of tradition about the revival of the dead in the future to come. 

Verse 7

<b>He also raises:</b> The addition ("also") is because ascent [requires] more power and strength than descent. 

Verse 8

<b>From the dunghill (<i>ashpot</i>):</b> It is singular with the construct of <i>achot</i> (sister), which when it is complete (plural) is <i>achiyot</i>. And the gathering [of dunghills) is (like in Lamentations 4:5), "embraced the <i>ashpatot</i>," in exchange for the accent being soft. 
<b>The pillars (<i>amudei</i>) of the earth:</b> The pedestals of the world. And likewise (Joshua 7:23), "and he planted them  (<i>yaamidum</i>) before the Lord." And the pillars of the earth are the righteous ones. For the world is preserved in their merit. And likewise, it says (Proverbs 10:25), "the righteous one is a foundation of the world." Or its explanation is in the way of (Deuteronomy  33:27), "under the everlasting forearms" - meaning to say, He is the preservation of the world and its support. And the supports of man are His and everything stands from His power, [as] is the order of the settlement of the world, to support creatures upon it. And that is what it stated, "He has set the world upon them" - since the places of inhabitation are called the world. 

Verse 9

<b>His faithful:</b> It is written without a [letter,] <i>yod</i>, but is read with a <i>yod</i>. And likewise (in I Samuel 2:10), "His enemies, upon him." And the matter is the same, since the <i>yod</i> of the plural sometimes drops out. 
<b>He guards:</b> That he should not be struck.
<b>Will be still:</b> Will be silent from their outbursts and their evil. Or the explanation is, they will be cut off - and likewise (Jeremiah 51:6), "do not be still in its iniquity." And the explanation of, "in darkness," is like a man that walks in darkness, such that he will fall.
<b>For not by strength shall a man prevail:</b> It will not be [like] what they thought, that they would prevail with their power and with their strength. For when it will be the will of God to place them in darkness - and that is the trouble that will come upon them - their might and their wealth will not help them. 

Verse 10

<b>O Lord, may His adversaries be shattered:</b> The adversaries of the righteous are His adversaries.
<b>In/From heaven shall He thunder upon him:</b> Upon him - upon each one of His adversaries. And the [letter,] <i>bet</i> (which normally means, in) of <i>beshamayim</i> is in place of <i>min</i> (from) - as it is stated (II Samuel 22:14), "The Lord will thunder <i>min</i> heaven." And likewise the <i>bet</i> in (Leviticus 22:14), "<i>bet</i> (from) the holy things, he may not eat"; (Leviticus 38:12) "And the remnant <i>bet</i> (from) the meat and from the bread"; and those that are similar to these. But it can [also] be explained according to its literal understanding - meaning to say, He will make the thunder in the heaven, to make them hear it and to confound them. And this is the explanation of, "upon him" - meaning to say, for his sake. And the thunder is a metaphor for the decrees that descend from heaven, as it said (II Samuel 22:2), "And He sent arrows and scattered them; lightning and bewildered them."
<b>He shall judge the ends of the earth:</b> In the way of (Job 28:24), "As He observes the ends of the earth"; and (Jeremiah 23:24), "If a man hides in hiding places [would I not see him]."
<b>And He shall give power to His king and exalt the horn of His anointed:</b> He repeated the thing, since the king [here] is the anointed one. And Channah said this by way of prophecy or by way of tradition. For she had a tradition that that there would be a king in Israel in the future. And she sealed this song with the words [about] the king, since she mentioned the downfall of the wicked - and those are the enemies of Israel - and she said that God should give power to the king of Israel, that He should save Israel from their enemies through him. And if she said this by way of prophecy, she hinted through it that through Shmuel, her son, there would be a king in Israel, and he would anoint him.

Verse 11

<b>Upon (<i>al</i>) his house:</b> It is like, to (<i>el</i>) his house. Likewise (I Samuel 1:10), "So she prayed upon (<i>al</i>) the Lord," is like, to the Lord.
<b>In the presence of Eli:</b> It is like, in front of him - meaning to say that Eli was teaching him the service of God. And Yonatan translated it [in the Targum] as, "during the life of Eli the priest," just like Onkelos translated (Deuteronomy 7:10), "in his presence, to destroy him," as, "during their lives, to destroy them."

<b>Disturbed me</b> from my rest. 
<b>to bring me up</b> from my rest. And in the homiletical teaching, [disturbed] is an expression of fear and trembling: I was afraid from the Day of Judgment, I thought it was the Day of Judgment and they were calling me for judgment. 
<b>either by prophets or in dreams:</b> But he did not say, by the Urim and Thumim, like the verse states above (I Samuel 28:6), that he also asked from the Urim. In the homiletical teaching, it is because he was embarrassed to say, "by the Urim," in front of Shmuel, since he killed [the men of] Nov, the city of priests.
<b>So I have called you (<i>ekeraeh</i>):</b> There is an additional <i>hey</i>, as is customary, like in, <i>eshmah</i> and <i>eshmerah</i>. But since the last letter of the root is [vocalized] with a <i>segol</i>, it is not customary. But  "<i>yidsheneh selah</i>" (Psalms 20:4) is like it.
