"And thus shall you say to them" (Ashuri: כִּדְנָה֙ תֵּאמְר֣וּן לְה֔וֹם) – This is a letter that God sent Jeremiah for the Babylonian exiled people to answer thus to the Chaldæans when they told them to worship their gods, answer them, "The gods who did not make heaven and earth will perish from earth and from below these heavens." And he wrote the letter for them in the Aramaic language so that they could say it to the Chaldæns in their tongue. And why does it say "and thus you shall say to them?" Because it's a warning to Israel. And that's also in Aramaic so as not to split the verse that it's half in Hebrew and half in Aramaic. And it says "to them" לְה֔וֹם with a mem ם because it appears twice as a mem - it's found in Ezra 5:3 "And thus, say to them" וְכֵן֙ אָמְרִ֣ין לְהֹ֔ם, even though it almost always comes with a nun ן.
These (Ashuri: אֵֽלֶּה). In both the Hebrew and Aramaic languages. This is also found in Ezra - "these vessels" (Ashuri: אלה מָֽאנַיָּ֔א - Ezra 5:15) written as אלה, and read as אֵ֚ל – and אל and אלה are one and the same, as in "these lands" (Ashuri: הָֽאֲרָצֹ֣ת הָאֵ֔ל - Genesis 26:3). And it says "these" because they are visible to humans, although they are high.
"And earth" (Ashuri: וְאַרְקָ֖א) meaning, "earth" (Ashuri: ארץ). And in the words of the Rabbis of blessed memory (Genesis Rabbah 13:12): Four names earth was called corresponding to its four corners - Eretz אֶרֶץ, Tevel תֵּבֵל, Adama אֲדָמָה, Arqa אַרְקָא. And Targum Jonathan translates the verse thus as it is, and does not elongate it in Aramaic. This is because the whole passage up to "The LORD of Hosts is His name" (Ashuri יְהוָ֥ה צְבָא֖וֹת שְׁמֽוֹ׃ – Jeremiah 10:16) is an answer that the children of Israel will say to them – "For we will not serve these gods who did not make heaven and earth, but rather the God who made earth in His might." And the Israelites will understand the Hebrew, and say it to the Chaldæans in Aramaic. But Jeremiah began the words sent to them in Aramaic, and Jonathan explains it in this regard: "He who made the earth in his might (Jeremiah 10:12)" = "And thus also you will say to them: We worship the one who made earth in his might! (Targum Jonathan on Jeremiah 10:12)" The truth is that Israel did not worship idols when exiled, and when they bowed to the image that Nebuchadnezzar had put up (see Daniel 3), they were forced. But even so, they were liable in the days of Haman, had God not had pity on them, as it is said (Megillah 12a) "Why was Israel in that generation liable for destruction? Because they had bowed to the image."

Found. When your words in my prophecy were found to accept you as willingly as a human being, this evening he told him and ate them:
2 Because your name is called Ali. In this I am very happy to be told by the Prophet of the Name and the other Prophets will read the Prophets of the Baal:
3 And so be your words. Write in the text and read your speech without a single language, as he said, and it should be written in detail and read in general:

One will not cut himself nor make a bald spot. And even though it is forbidden to Israel to do it - as it is written, "you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead" - perhaps they did like the customs of the nations, just like they did other sins like the customs of the nations. And it states that they will not have the free time to do the things that they do for the dead - not the things of mourning and not the things of consolation.

Together with the blind and the lame: They will come unhurriedly so that even the blind and the lame that will be among them, and the pregnant one and the one giving birth will walk slowly. And my father z''l interprets the verse "And I will lead them slowly on a straight path" until the blind and the lame and the pregnant one and the one giving birth will be able to walk with them without stumbling as they walk

<b>Behold days are coming... new covenant</b>. Its newness is that it will be kept, and not broken like the covenant that b'nei Yisrael cut with God at Mount Sinai. Regarding this and it says, for the prophet [Yirmiyahu] prophesies about a 'new Torah' which will in the future come to be. This isn't like a new Torah which was given at Mount Sinai, since it says <b>"not according to the covenant that I made with their ancestors"</b> (Yirmiyahu 31:32). This is the new Torah, that their repentance/returning has renewed for them. And behold it says, the explanation - and how is it <b>"not according to the covenant that I made with their ancestors"</b>? That they <b>"broke my covenant"</b> (ibid.) - and they will not break this covenant, because I will put my Tora in their hearts, <b>"and on their hearts I will write it"</b> (Yirmiyahu 31:33), so that they will never forget it. And the whole matter is as explained when it goes on, that it won't be a newness of the covenant but rather its fulfilment/keeping (קיומה). And behold it says, Malachi sealed the prophets with the seal of his words: <b>"Remember the Tora of Moshe my servant, which I commanded him in Ḥorev for all Yisra᾽el, both statutes and judgments."</b> (Malachi 3:22) - that whole section will be in the future, just like it seals <b> "Behold, I will send you Eliyya, the prophet"</b> (Malachi 3:23) - behold, you see tha there will never be a new Torah, but for the one which was given at Mount Sinai, like it says <b> "which I commanded him in Ḥorev"</b> (Malachi 3:22)

Isaac (ישחק). Written with a שי״ן (sin) like with a צד״י (tzadi) because the two roots are equal in the matter, and the two letters are of one origin, and this is one of four times the appellation for Isaac is written with a sin.

<b>That we send.</b> In the verse it is written <i>Anu</i>, but we read <i>anaḥnu</i>, and this matter is unique, but the word <i>anu&gt;/i&gt; is not found elsewhere in Tanakh, but is common in the language of Mishnah and Talmud.</i>
