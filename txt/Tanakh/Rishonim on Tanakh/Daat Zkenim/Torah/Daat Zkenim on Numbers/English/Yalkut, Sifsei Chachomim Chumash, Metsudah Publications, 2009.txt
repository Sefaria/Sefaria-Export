<b>According to the number of individual names</b>. Why does it say “individual (לגלגלתם)” by Reuven and Shimon and not by the rest of the tribes? The answer is that Yaakov was angry at them when he blessed his sons so they needed an atonement, and regarding the <i>shekalim</i> that atone it is written (Shemos 38:26), “One <i>beka</i> per person (לגלגלת)”.

Verse 1

<b>These are the descendants</b>. That is, the kohanim and Levites are the descendants. The sons of Aharon were counted first by themselves, as it says (Divrei HaYamim I 23:13), “And Aharon was separated, to be sanctified as most holy.” The sons of Moshe, however, were not separated from the rest of the Levites, and therefore their descendants are included with the Levites that were descended from Amram.

<b>When it rested, he would say</b>. When the Cloud rested on the <i>Mishkon</i> he would say, “May it be Hashem’s will that all the thousands and myriads of Israel return to their place, in their number, and that no man should be missing” In this sense, שובה means השיבה — may He cause to return.

<b>If there will be a prophet among you</b>. This is in response to what Miriam and Aharon said, “Did He not also speak with us?” The way Hashem spoke with Moshe does not resemble the way He spoke with them or with other prophets. With another prophet, “In a dream I will speak to him” — as a person who sees in a dream which requires interpretation. Or, “I will make Myself known to him in a vision (מראה)” — as a person who sees his reflection in a mirror (מראה) but does not see the actual person. This refers to Hashem speaking by way of metaphor.

<b>Until we have passed through your territory.</b> They were not asking to pass through Sichon’s land, but rather only to go around his border from the outside, as they went around the land of Edom and Moav. And so it says in Parshas Devorim: “As the descendants of Eisov did for me who live in Seir” — they let the Bnei Yisroel go around their land and border.

<b>Just as the ox laps.</b> Because it doesn't have sharp upper teeth as does a horse or donkey, it can't cut the herbs. Rather, due to its strength, it completely uproots them.

Verse 7


<b>With magic charms.</b> With the payment for magic charms in their hands. The Targum Yerushalmi says likewise, <i>ve'igra de'kasamaya be'ya'dei'hon</i>. Alternatively, the Targum Yerushalmi could be understood as: They brought him books of magic.

<b>I see it but not now.</b> Moshe did not speak in the same manner. Rather, he said (Devorim 32:35), for the day of their [the nations] calamity is close by, and destiny speeds towards them. This is analogous to a king traveling on a journey accompanied by a friend and an enemy, and the king becomes thirsty. His enemy tells him, We are far away from water, in order to cause him pain. But the friend says, Your Majesty, ride onward for water is close by, in order to soothe him. Likewise, Bil'am the enemy said that salvation is far off in the distance. But the friend said (Yeshayahu 56:1), Guard justice and perform righteousness because salvation is soon to come. 
<b>A star has gone forth from Yaakov.</b> The dominion of Yaakov will be strengthened. The term דרך means strengthening, as in the verse (Shoftim 5:21), My soul was strengthened (תדרכי) with might.

<b>One he-goat.</b> It does not say, “for a sin-offering,” in honor of the Torah which was given on Shavuos. An alternative explanation: At that time Bnei Yisroel were cleansed of all sin.

Chapter 29



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>You shall bring [ועשיתם] a burnt-offering.</b> Why was this different than all the other sin-offerings in which it was written “ והקרבתם— and you shall offer”? The answer is because Rosh HaShanah is the Day of Judgment, and when the people of Israel enter judgment they are made [נעשים] like a new creation. And this is what the liturgical poet wrote: He Who created them as a new creation.

Verse 1

<b>Very large herds.</b> They were very rich and adored their wealth, and because of this love of money they separated from their brothers and dwelled outside of Eretz Yisroel. Therefore, they were the first to be exiled of all the tribes, as it says (Divrei HaYamim I 5:26): “And they exiled the Reuvenites and the Gaddites, and half the tribe of Menashe.” The proper attitude about wealth is taught in the verses (Tehillim 75:7-8): “For it is not from the east or from the west, neither from the desert does elevation come. But Hashem judges; He humbles this one and elevates that one.” This means that the labor a man puts into business, when he travels from east to west, pushing himself become rich, is not what makes him wealthy. His elevation does not come from this. The real source is: “But Hashem judges; He humbles this one and elevates that one.” Hashem takes property from this one and gives it to that one. Why is property called נכסים? Because they are hidden (נכסין) from this one, and revealed to another. Why is money called זוזים? Because they move (זזין) from this one and go to another. Why is money also called ממון? That is to say, why do you count (מונה) it? And why are coins called מעות? Because they distort (מעוותין) justice.
