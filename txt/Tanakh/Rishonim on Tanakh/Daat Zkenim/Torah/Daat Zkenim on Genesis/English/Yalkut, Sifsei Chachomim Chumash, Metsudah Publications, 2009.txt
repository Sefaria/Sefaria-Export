<b>By the sweat of your face.</b> Rabbi Yehudah HaChassid noted that not all men are subject to this curse whereas all women give birth in pain. This is because Chavah not only sinned, but also caused another to sin.

<b>However (<i>ach</i>), of the blood.</b> See Rashi. According to the Sages the word <i>ach</i> always limits the law it precedes. Thus in times of persecution a person is permitted to take his own life to avoid torture if he is afraid he will not be able to withstand his trial. However, some authorities argue with this.

<b>On that very day.</b> Literally, “In the strength of the day” — i.e. in the heat of the day. By comparison with the wording of <i>Vayikra</i> 23:28 the Sages derive that this was Yom Kippur. <b>Avraham and his son … were circumcised.</b> He called upon Shem to perform their circumcisions.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

<b>In the groves of Mamrei.</b> See Rashi. Avraham asked him whether to perform the circumcision publicly or privately. Mamrei advised that he should do it publicly so that others would be inspired to emulate him.

<b>A reddish complexion.</b> According to the <i>midrash</i> Yitzchok initially postponed Eisov’s circumcision because of his color. When he realized that this was his natural appearance he reasoned that since he was not circumcised at eight days, it was better to wait until he was thirteen, as Yishmael had been. But when Eisov turned thirteen, he refused to consent.

<b>Eisov scorned the birthright.</b> That is, he had already scorned it before this incident, which is why Yaakov resolved to acquire it from him. Rabbi Yehudah HaChassid derived from here that it is permissible to trick an evildoer into selling a mitzvah object that is in his possession.

<b>When it was morning.</b> See Rashi. According to the <i>midrash</i> Yaakov asked, “Why did you answer when I called you “Rochel”? She replied, “Why did you answer your father when he called you “Eisov”? From that moment on he began to hate her.
