<b>And they were not ashamed.</b> They used their limbs solely for the service of their Maker, not the pursuit of base pleasures. Therefore they considered marital relations no different than eating and drinking and their reproductive organs no different than their mouth or hands.

<b>He banished the man.</b> Neither he nor his offspring would be permitted to return.

<b>To Hevel and to his offering.</b> Hashem was pleased with both Hevel himself as well as with his offering.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>Why are you angry.</b> Why are you jealous that I accepted your brother’s offering? I did not do so arbitrarily nor was it unjust.
<b>Why are you depressed.</b> It is pointless to brood over the past when the matter can be rectified

Verse 8

<b>But Noach found favor (<i>chen</i>).</b> <i>Chen</i> implies groundless favor. Because Noach did not actively spread knowledge of Hashem he was not worthy that others should be saved on his account. Thus it was an act of groundless favor to him that his sons and daughters-in-law were spared.

Verse 13

<b>The end of all flesh.</b> That is, the end of their 120 year reprieve. 

<b>The earth is filled with violent crime.</b> A landlord would steal openly from his tenant farmer while the tenant farmer stole surreptitiously from the landlord in return. Thus all the earth’s bounty went to thieves.

<b>In His heart.</b> He did not reveal this resolution to Noach and his sons until after they had accepted His commandments and He established His covenant with them.
<b>For the inclination of man’s heart.</b> Human makeup was now inferior to what it was before the flood and the intellect no longer held sway during the years of youth. This enabled the appetites to achieve domination

<b>Cham was the father of Canaan.</b> Canaan infamous for his wickedness and Cham was similar in character, thus he was the father of Canaan in the spiritual as well as the biological sense.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Noach began.</b> Since his first undertaking was an unworthy one it led to disgraceful consequences, illustrating that a small flaw at the outset of an endeavor leads to a large one in the end.

Verse 25

<b>For in his days the earth was dispersed.</b> Eiver named his son in anticipation of the dispersion (<i>palaga</i>) so that later generations would realize why their life expectancy was drastically reduced from Peleg’s time onward. It was in fact a consequence of the dispersion, since rapid changes of climate have a deleterious affect on human health.

Verse 4


<b>Thus we will make for ourselves a name.</b> This “name” was the idol that was to be placed in the tower. They hoped that on account of the grandeur of the tower and the city this idol would come to be recognized universally as the supreme deity. In this way the king of the city would achieve dominion over the entire world.

<b>I am excluding myself.</b> Literally, “Without me” — i.e. “You can take it without asking me because I claim no part of it.”  
<b>Only what the lads have eaten.</b> Avraham claimed only the cost of provisioning his men, but Aneir, Eshkol and Mamrei could take their share for themselves.

Verse 6

<b>He believed.</b> He had utter confidence that God would fulfill His promise, even if it required a miracle. 
<b>And this He accounted.</b> God reckoned Avraham’s trust as an act of righteousness, which proves that his subsequent inquiry, “How will I know, etc.?” could not have been an expression of doubt.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Know for sure.</b> God’s main point here was that the inheritance of the Land had to wait until the sin of the Emorites was complete (v. 16). Along the way, however, He revealed the suffering that would befall some of Avraham’s offspring when they failed to live up to their obligations.

<b>Where is Sarah.</b> Avraham already knew of Yitzchok’s impending conception (see 17:19). Thus the angels were sent specifically to inform Sarah. This was in order that her rejoicing would have a positive influence on the fetus.

<b>I will descend now.</b> I will plumb the depths of their wickedness to see what will come of it in the end.
<b>And see.</b> I will allow their true colors to be seen by allowing them to attack Lot for his generosity. Then the world will know that it was not for naught that they were punished.
<b>If their wailing … is indicative … destruction [shall come].</b> Alternatively, “If all of them participated” — I will see whether any of them protests

Verse 22

<b>Avraham was still standing.</b> Even after the angels arrived in Sedom he did not give up but remained standing in prayer and supplication.

<b>Deeds that ought not to be done.</b> You brought harm to a stranger with whom you had no prior relationship of enmity, and without profit to yourself.

Chapter 21



Verse 1

<b>Ad-noy remembered.</b> Literally, “<i>And</i> Ad-noy remembered” — after Avraham prayed for Avimelech, Hashem remembered Sarah.
<b>As He had said.</b> “I will bless her” (17:16) — that is, He delivered her from the curse of Chavah (see 3:16). 
<b>As He had spoken.</b> “I will also give you a son through her” (17:16) — in defiance of the general rule that elderly parents beget daughters.

<b>Now I know.</b> These were the words of the angel — “Now I know why God elevated you above us.”
<b>From Me (or, “than I am”).</b> These are also the words of the angel. The verse should be inverted and read: “You are more God-fearing than I am because you did not withhold your son”.

<b>She also gave birth.</b> Avraham was told that if he did not wish to take Rivkah for his son, Re’umah also had a daughter — Ma’achoh — who was fitting to be Yitzchok’s wife.

Chapter 23



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Sarah died.</b> She did not die until a fitting successor was born and Avraham was apprised of the fact.
<b>To eulogize Sarah.</b> Literally, “to eulogize <i>for</i> Sarah” — a eulogy is for the honor of the deceased.

Verse 11

<b>No, my master, hear me.</b> There is no need for the leaders of the community to intercede with me. 

<b>I have given you the field.</b> In my mind I gave it to you the moment you spoke.

Verse 12

<b>Avraham bowed.</b> He bowed to them to acknowledge that it was in their honor that Ephron consented.

Chapter 24



Verse 1

<b>Avraham was old.</b> He was concerned that he might die without seeing his son married off; therefore he resolved to seek a wife for him without delay. <b>Place your hand.</b> Because of his wealth Avraham was concerned that someone unworthy might bribe Eliezer into taking his daughter for Yitzchok. For this reason he made him swear not to take a Canaanite woman.

<b>I will also water your camels.</b> A supplicant should ask for less than his needs and the giver should provide him with all his needs or more.
<b>Whom You have determined.</b> <i>Hochachta</i> in Hebrew can also be rendered “whom You have rebuked” — You admonished and instructed her until she was worthy of marrying Yitzchok.

Verse 21

<b>Wondering at her.</b> He was amazed at her zeal. 
<b>Remained silent.</b> He did not try to dissuade her from troubling herself. <b>Waiting to determine.</b> The way she performed her good deeds was to be the test.
<b>Whether Ad-noy had made.</b> If she acted out of pure kindness he would know that his mission was successful.
<b>Or not.</b> If she expected payment she was not the right one

Verse 22

<b>When the camels had finished.</b> He did not give her the jewelry immediately after she finished drawing the water because he was waiting to see if she would ask for remuneration.

Verse 4

<b>Made it into a tasty dish.</b> Yitzchok knew that Eisov was not worthy of the blessing that he wished to confer upon him. For this reason he instructed him to perform an act of honor towards him to give him merit. By contrast when he blessed Yaakov (28:3) he knew that he needed no additional merit.

Verse 15

<b>Isn’t it enough that you took.</b> You should not have agreed to become my co-wife in the first place, since the Torah disapproves of marrying sisters.  
<b>Would you also take.</b> Do you now wish to increase Yaakov’s love for you and his hatred for me?

Verse 16

<b>You will come to me.</b> This will entail no injustice since Rochel agreed. Like Adam before the sin, the Patriarchs and Matriarchs related to reproduction as nothing other than a way to produce more servants for Hashem.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Elokim has given.</b> Hashem gave her Yissachar in reward for her first effort in giving Yaakov her maidservant and He gave her Zevulun in reward for her second effort in trading the jasmine flowers for an additional night with him.
<b>A goodly portion.</b> She was deserving of reward because her only intention was to increase Hashem’s honor.

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>Elokim remembered Rochel.</b> He remembered the efforts she made to produce offspring for Yaakov by giving him her maidservant and acquiring the jasmine flowers.
 <b>And Elokim perceived (literally, “heard”).</b> After she made the two efforts mentioned above, she then prayed to Him and He heard her prayers.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27


<b>Ad-noy has blessed you with my coming.</b> Lavan attributed his prosperity to Yaakov’s fortune whereas Yaakov insisted it was due to his effort. But one way or another, it was true that Hashem had blessed Lavan with his coming.

Verse 28

Verse 30


<b>When will I also do.</b> When will I have the opportunity to bring blessing to my own house the way you have brought it to yours through my presence

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b>My righteousness … when it comes before you.</b> Or, “When my righteousness shall go to show my wage, it will testify before you” — i.e., Hashem will reveal what Yaakov deserves for his faithful service by altering the coloration of the lambs.

Chapter 31



Verse 1

<b>He heard the words.</b> He heard that Lavan’s sons were slandering him out of jealousy.

<b>Do we still have a portion.</b> Why do you think it will be difficult for us to part from our father?

Verse 15



Verse 16

b&gt;All the wealth that Elokim rescued. We do not expect to receive from him anything other than what Hashem has already rescued.
<b>Now.</b> Now that he has accepted the slander about you and may use it to justify stealing whatever you have.
<b>Whatever Hashem has said, do it.</b> There is no need for you to seek further permission.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Yaakov fooled Lavan.</b> He did not give any sign that he knew that Lavan had accepted the slander about him.
<b>The Aramean.</b> Besides indicating his nationality, which is irrelevant here, this hints that he was an experienced swindler (<i>ramai</i>). Thus if he had realized that Yaakov knew of the change in his attitude he would not have left him any escape.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>Guard yourself that you do not speak.</b> You are forbidden even to speak!
