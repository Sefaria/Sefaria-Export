Sforno on Deuteronomy



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>Eleven days from Chorev.</b> For all thirty eight years that they were in the desert they moved here and there and did not go on a straight and direct path to their destination. Whenever they came to a place from where they would have to [retrace their steps and] move backwards or to the sides, Moshe would tell them, “Look what your actions caused. For it is an eleven day journey from Chorev to Kadesh Barnea via Mount Se’ir, which is the quickest route for travelers. Hashem led you to Kadesh Barnea in three days through the great and terrible wilderness. But because of your sins you are constantly moving,” He would say all of this to them in order that they would remember and return to Hashem.

<b>And we walked the entire great wilderness.</b> A path that had not been travelled before by men, due to the great number of snakes, scorpions and other dangerous obstacles, as the verse states, “Snake serpent and scorpion” (Devarim 8:15). Our Rabbis have already told us that the snakes were the size of beams, and the scorpions the size of bows. Hashem did all of this for them in order to shorten the path for them, so that they could enter the land immediately, before their pots became like thorns and they had sinned too much. But even so it was not sufficient, because they still managed to sin with the complainers, and with their desire for meat, and with the spies.

<b>That has Hashem close to it.</b> The reason that it is important to be particular that they should be considered clever and wise in the eyes of the nations is because Hashem is close to us in everything that we do. This will show that He chose us from all the nations. However if the nations consider you to be foolish it will profane Hashem’s name, when they say, “Are these Hashem’s people?”

<b>Do not think.</b> When you see your miraculous victory and recognize that it is the work of Hashem,  
do not mistakenly think that it was your righteousness that brought you to inherit the land, and that you are worthy of inheriting the land in your merit.  
<b>Because of the wickedness of these nations is Hashem expelling them before you.</b> The reason that Hashem fought for you was because of the wickedness of the gentile nations, not in order that you should inherit quickly.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>For you are a stubborn people.</b> It is impossible that a stubborn people will be righteous and upright. One who is stubborn will follow his thoughts and ideas even if teachers show him clearly that they are not good, and will cause him to fail. He will not pay attention to this teacher, and will act as though his neck is set with iron, so that he is unable to turn to either side, and will continue to go after his own ideas.

<b>The Almighty — the Great.</b> There is nothing that can compare to him on any of the levels of creation.
<b>The powerful</b>. Who gives continued existence to all of creation, as they said, “You give life to everything” (Nechemiah 9:6).  
<b>The Awesome. </b>Who watches to reward and punish those who fear Him accordingly.
<b>Who neither exercises favoritism</b>. To a son who breaks away, to show favor to the righteous father. Even though He will hold back His anger for a long time in the merit of the father.  
<b>Nor accepts bribes.</b> He will not remove the punishment for the sin because of the reward of a <i>mitzvah</i> that the sinner has done. As our Sages teach: A <i>mitzvah</i> does not extinguish a sin (Sotah 21a). All of this comes to teach that if you sin you may not rely on Hashem to save you from any punishment in any merit, unless you perform complete <i>teshuvah</i>.

<b>For if you truly guard.</b> If you are involved in Torah in order to recognize the kindness of Hashem, this will lead to love.  
<b>To walk in all His ways.</b> Accustom yourself in those ways with which He runs the world — righteousness and justice.
<b>And cling to Him.</b> That all of your actions will be with the intention of doing His will, as the verse states, “In all your ways, know Him” (Mishlei 3:6).

Verse 26

<b>Look.</b> Look and see that you will never be average, like the majority. Rather, I give you today a choice between blessing and curse, which are the two extremes. The blessing is greater success than required, reaching the upper limit of goodness, but curse is affliction of lack where even the minimum cannot be attained. These are both before you, to choose which you prefer.

Verse 1

<b>Do not add to it.</b> For perhaps you will add something which Hashem finds disgusting. For example, if you add types of worship to the service of Hashem, sometimes the additional worship will be disgusting for Hashem, such as burning children.  
<b>Do not subtract from it.</b> Even if the reason for the mitzvah seems to no longer apply, like Shlomo, who thought that he could have many wives and not be led to sin.

<b>He may not prefer the son of the loved one.</b> The birthright of the eldest son may not be transferred due to love or hatred for one or another of his wives. However, if the father transfers the birthright due to the wicked behavior of the son, then he acts appropriately. As our Sages have said: If the son does not act in a proper manner, a father who disinherits him will be remembered for good (Bava Basra 133b). This is what Yaakov did, as the verse states, “Because he defiled his father's couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Yisroel” (I Divrei HaYomim 5:1).

<b>To the <i>kohein:</i></b> Even though he is not great in wisdom, you must still speak to him respectfully. You must say, “Hashem, your God” even though this phrase is only spoken to people of stature, such as kings or prophets. Nevertheless, since you are bringing your first fruits to him, like bringing a gift to Hashem, Master of the Heavens, it is appropriate to speak respectfully also to the <i>kohein</i>.

Verse 4

<b>And place it.</b> To show and make known that the first fruits were not brought to the <i>kohein</i> but to Hashem. Hashem gave them to the <i>kohein</i> along with the other priestly gifts.

Verse 5

<b>The Aramite.</b> My father, Yaakov, was for many years a wandering Aramite. He had not fixed abode, and therefore was not able to establish a nation worthy of inheriting the land of Israel.

<b>And you will return.</b> Your repentance will be in order to solely perform the will of your Creator. This is the type of repentance that reaches the Heavenly Throne.
<b>And obey Him exactly.</b> Not out of habit, as you did before now.  
<b>You and your sons.</b> Even the children of the next generation will recognize this, as the verse states, “All of you know Me, from the young to the old” (Yirmiyahu 31:33). 
<b>Wholeheartedly.</b> So that you will have no doubt.
<b>With your whole being.</b> Your desires of your soul will not prevent you, when you recognize the importance of the matter.

<b>I am 120 years old today.</b> Do not be sad at my death, for I was would not have lived any longer by the laws of nature.  
<b>I cannot any longer go forth and return.</b> Even if I would have lied longer, I would no longer be able to come and go before the people, due to my old age.  
<b>For Hashem has said to me:</b> Even If I was able to come and go, Hashem has said to me that I may not cross the Yardein, and if so, it is better for you that I die now so that you can cross.

<b>He granted them understanding.</b> As it states, “The Torah and the mitzvos, which I have written, that you may teach them” (Shemos 24:12).

In order to do so, the people of Sodom would respise any kind of kindness to others, as the prophet testified when he said about them, “Behold, this was the sin of your sister Sodom: she her daughters had pride, satiety, and tranquil peace but she did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.” (Yechezkel 16:49).
