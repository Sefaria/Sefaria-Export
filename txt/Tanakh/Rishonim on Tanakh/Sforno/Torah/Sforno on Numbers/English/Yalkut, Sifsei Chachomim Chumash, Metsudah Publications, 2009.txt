<b>And they were registered by family ancestry</b>. Because this counting was so they would be enlisted into an army of war the intention was to guard their lineage, for the merit of their forefathers would assist them in war. The Sages already said about this (<i>Mishnayos, Kiddushin</i> 4:5), “We do not examine someone who was listed in the king’s list.” This is because the Divine Presence only dwells with the families of lineage in the people of Israel, as the Sages said.

<b>Were not counted</b>. They were not counted by those who did the counting and did not count themselves, as they did not prepare themselves like the rest of the nation by assembling according to lineage. This happened before Hashem told Moshe (v. 48), “However, the tribe of Levi you shall not count,” for indeed, they waited to see what Hashem would command them, since the tribe of Levi was not mentioned with the rest of the tribes, as it says (v. 4), “There shall be one man for each tribe, etc.”

<b>Acting treacherously against Hashem.</b> The Sages explained that this refers to property stolen from a proselyte at the time the Beis HaMikdash is standing. One who steals from a proselyte profanes the name of Hashem from the point of view of the proselyte, who had come to take refuge under the wings of the Divine Presence. Therefore, it is termed “acting treacherously” in holy matters, and he must bring a guilt offering as the law applying to anyone who acts treacherously.

<b>[When] a spirit of jealousy comes upon him.</b> This is a pure spirit that causes him to warn her, since he knows that she strayed from the ways of modesty. 
<b>And he is jealous of his wife.</b> He warned her and told her not to go into seclusion with a certain man.
 <b>Or, a spirit of jealousy comes upon him.</b> This refers to a spirit of folly, for there was no suitable reason for him to be jealous.  
<b>And she was not defiled.</b> However, if she ignored his warning and went into seclusion, then even though she was not defiled, “that man shall bring his wife to the <i>kohein</i>”.

Verse 2

<b>Sets apart.</b> He sets himself apart from the vanities and enjoyments of human beings.
<b>A vow, a nazirite vow.</b> To be a separated from the habitual enjoyments. 
<b>To set [himself] apart for Hashem.</b> He removes himself from all these in order to be entirely for Hashem, to occupy himself in His Torah, to go in His ways and to cleave to Him.

Verse 3

<b>From new or old wine he must abstain.</b> A person should not afflict himself with fasting which decreases his Divine service, as the Sages said, nor should one cause himself pain with lashes as do the ascetics. However, one may abstain from wine, for in this way he decreases physical desires and subjugates his urges, but he will not exhaust his strength at all.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>He shall have no contact with the dead.</b> He should not profane his holiness by dealing with the honor of the dead, as we find concerning a <i>Kohein Godol</i>. In a similar vein, our Sages related [that Rabbi Avohu said to his son who was sent to study Torah and instead was doing acts of kindness]: “Is it because there is a lack of graves in Tiveria that I sent you to Netzivin?” [i.e., Torah study comes before good deeds].

<b>Because the sacred work was upon them.</b> The sons of Kehos had the work of the <i>Mikdash</i> and not the work of the Tent. By the Divine word, the wagons would be for the work of the Tent of Meeting, which was carried by the sons of Gershon and Merori. The sons of Kehos, on the other hand, carried nothing from the structure of the Tent of Meeting. They carried the Holy Vessels that were inside, which are collectively called the <i>Mikdash</i>, as it says, “The Kehos family, the carriers of the <i>Mikdash</i>, traveled”.

Verse 13

<b>His offering was one silver tray.</b> Each one of them brought all types of offerings — burnt-offering, meal-offering, sin-offering, peace-offering, and incense — to inaugurate the Altar and its servants with all types of offering. The guilt-offering was excluded, though, because the sin-offering and the guilt-offering have the same law. The Torah relates the offering of each one of the leaders by itself because each leader had special intentions to atone for the particular sins prevalent in his tribe. This intention was in each of the details of his offering, to be acceptable before Hashem. The leader rested his hands on the offerings and stood by them on behalf of his tribe, just as the people of Israel would do for public offerings.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>For they are given</b>. They gave themselves over to Hashem for His service, as the verse testifies: “Whoever is for Hashem, [come] to me. All the sons of Levi gathered around him” (Shemos 32:26). Also, they are given from within the Bnei Yisroel, for the Israelites support the Levites with the first tithes in exchange for their service. In this way, the Divine service is accomplished through all the Jewish people together.

<b>So why are you not afraid</b>. It is inescapable that this was morally reprehensible. For if you thought that I do not know his deeds, then you thought I made a mistake, and that I favor wicked people. This is the opposite of what you should have thought, for I would not have lifted him up to this level unless he is worthy. Therefore, you should have feared speaking about such a person. And if you thought that I do not know his deeds, and that you know more about him that I do, because I thought he was worthy and it is not so, then you have accused Me of making a mistake in even stronger terms. Concerning this the Sages said: This (statement) is worse than the first.

<b>See what the land is.</b> Is it a land settled with many cities and villages?
<b>And the people living on it.</b> This will determine if it is a good land to live in. Physicians have taught that in choosing a region in which to live one should look at the inhabitants. Are they strong and physically whole, or the opposite? Also, one should look at whether they are many or few, for if they are both many and strong, this indicates that the air of the land and its produce are good, whereas the opposite indicates the opposite.

They take the blame for the sin of the multitude, and I will not grant them any extension. Nevertheless: <b>The complaints of Bnei Yisroel, which they complain against Me, I have heard</b> — and I will set Myself to punish them. Therefore: <b>Say to them…</b>

<b>If you should err.</b> Our tradition explains that Scripture speaks here of an error regarding idol worship.
 <b>And not fulfill all of these commandments.</b> Since they erred in idol worship, even if they fulfilled all the actions of the commandments, they have not performed the commandments that Hashem spoke about to Moshe. This is because Hashem preceded all the commandments with the knowledge of His Divinity, as it says, “I am Hashem, your God.” Similarly, our Sages said: One who acknowledges idol worship is as one who denies the entire Torah.

<b>And you will be holy unto your God.</b> You will be holy before Hashem for Eternal Life, as Hashem’s intention in the verse: “You will be to Me a kingdom of <i>kohanim,</i> and a holy nation.”.

<b>And who is holy, He will bring close to Him.</b> Hashem will inform who is holy and worthy to bring the offerings before Him.  
<b>And whoever He chooses, He will bring near to Him.</b> That person alone will Hashem bring near to Him, out of the upset of the remaining persons, as it says, “Separate yourselves from among this congregation”.

Therefore, Balak did not ask Bil'am to bless him for victory or to be able to withstand them. He said I know that whomever you bless is blessed out of respect to Bil'am, to show that he does not consider him as one who only does harm.

<b>How goodly are your tents.</b> This refers to the academies of Torah study, as in the verse (Bereishis 25:27), living in tents, and as in the verse (Bereishis 9:27), but He will dwell in the tents of Sheim, and as in the verse (Shemos 33:7), Everyone who sought Adonoy would go out to the Tent of Meeting.  
<b>Your dwelling places.</b> This refers to the synagogues and sanctuaries for Hashem that are sanctified for His name to dwell there and to receive the prayers of whoever prays there. The verse says how goodly [in the plural, מה טובו], for besides that they are beneficial for whoever is occupied in them, in addition, they are beneficial for the entire nation.

<b>From the families of Menashe.</b> After they saw that the intention of their Creator was that their inheritance should not be transferred, even though He gave them permission to choose on their own volition from any tribe, they chose their cousins out of all of the families, because they were closer in relationship, and their inheritance remained with the tribe of their father’s family, therefore there was no transfer of inheritance even from one family to another.
