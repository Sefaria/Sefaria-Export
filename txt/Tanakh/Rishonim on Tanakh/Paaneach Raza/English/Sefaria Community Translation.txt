Shemot















The name of one was Shifrah: I found in the name of Rabbi Yehudah HeChasid that they were Egyptians at first and that they converted. For were it not so, how would Pharaoh trust them, to command them to kill the children; and how could they have been quiet about this thing, as if his words were fine with them. Is not this something for which one should die and not transgress? And also how are they exceptional, that it states, "And the midwives feared, etc.?" Rather they had been Egyptians, but now in the present, "they feared [God], etc." - since they converted. But beforehand, they did not possess fear of God.
