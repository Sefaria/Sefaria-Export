Ibn Ezra on Genesis

Introduction

Invoking<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. opens with a poetic introduction. In fact, in Hebrew the entire introduction was in rhyme.</i> the name of the Great and Awe-inspiring God,
I begin to explain the meaning of the Torah.
I beseech thee, O God of my father Abraham,
deal kindly with thy servant Abraham.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">The first Abraham refers to the patriarch, the second to the author, Abraham son of Meir.</i>
May the opening of thy words give light
to thy servant the son of thy servant Meir.
And from the salvation of thy face,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 80:4, 8.</i> may help come
to the son of thy maid servant who is named Ben Ezra.
This <i>Book of Jashar</i>,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. called his commentary on the Torah, <i>The Book of Jashar</i>. Cf. Josh. 10:13.</i> composed by Abraham the poet,
is bound by ropes of grammar.
The eyes of the intelligent will find it fit.
All who take hold of it will be glad.
The above mentioned Abraham the Spaniard says:
Those who comment on the Torah do so in one of five ways.
The first way (to Biblical interpretation) ranges far and wide (from the text). It is beyond the interest of our time. If truth be likened to a dot within a circle then this approach can be compared to the periphery of the circle, which goes round about only to return to its starting point. A number of great scholars chose this approach, namely, the wise men of the academies in Moslem countries, such as Rabbi Isaac<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear which Isaac I.E. is referring to. Some identify him with the philosopher Isaac Israeli (c. 850-950). Cf. Weiser.</i> who composed two books on the first chapter of Genesis, from <i>In the beginning</i> to <i>were finished</i>, and did not finish his commentary, so verbose was he. He makes mention of the believers in a god of light and a god of darkness<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Zoroastrianism (Weiser).</i> in his comments on the verse <i>Let there be light</i> (Gen. 1:3). But he (Rabbi Isaac) walked in darkness without being aware of it. In his comment on <i>And the earth brought forth grass</i> (Gen. 1:12), he brought forth words from his fancy<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, heart. He did not quote anyone but gave his own opinion or invented facts.</i> and spoke about trees and plants both large and small. On the other hand, on the term <i>living creature</i><sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser.</i> he quoted foreign sciences. In the same vein, Rabbi Saadiah, Gaon of the Diaspora, commenting on the verse <i>Let there be lights</i> (Gen. 1:14), quoted the opinion of secular scholars and gave the dimensions of the heavenly bodies according to the astronomers. Similarly Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni <i>gathered wind in his fists</i> (chofnav) (Prov. 30:4)<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">A play on the words <i>chofni</i> (Hofni) and <i>chofnav</i>.</i> in his lengthy comments on <i>And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba</i> (Gen. 28:10). He there mentioned every prophet by name, and how many times each one was exiled from his place. He also expounded on the value of travel. The only value of his commentary is its length. On the verse <i>And he dreamed</i> (Gen. 28:12) he expostulated on dream interpretation and why people see what they see when they are asleep. If one desires to learn secular wisdom let him learn it from the works of experts in these fields and let him examine their proofs and see if they are correct. The Geonim only cited from these works without offering any of the proofs as to the veracity of the opinions they quoted.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">The reader thus has no way of knowing whether what is quoted is true or not.</i> Some of the Geonim had no knowledge of the method of the ancient sages and how they arrived at their conclusions.
A second approach is the one chosen by the distorters, albeit they are Israelites. They think that they have reached the very point of the circle, but in reality they do not know its place. This is the way of the Sadducees,<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites. The medieval rabbis called the Karaites Sadducees because like the Sadducees they denied the authority of the Rabbinic sages, the Mishnah and the Talmud.</i> such as Anan,<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">The founder of Karaism. He lived in the 8th century.</i> Benjamin,<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Benjamin ben Moses Nahavendi (c. 9th century). He was the first Karaite scholar to write in Hebrew and was responsible for the term “Karaites” replacing “Ananites.”</i> Ben Mashiach, Joshua,<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Some of the printed editions omit Ben Mashiach and Joshua. Hasan ben Mashiach was a Karaite who engaged in polemics with Saadiah Gaon. Joshua was a Karaite scholar often quoted by I.E. It is suggested that the reference is to Joshua ben Judah Abu al-Farag Purkan, one of the founders of Karaism (Weiser).</i> and of all heretics who do not believe the words of the transmitters of tradition,<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbinic sages.</i> turning away from it to the right or the left.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbinic tradition, the Biblical verse, <i>thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left</i> (Deut. 17:11), is a command to heed the words of the “transmitters of tradition.”</i> Each one interprets verses as he sees fit. They do the same even with respect to commandments and laws. They are ignorant of the form of Hebrew and therefore err even in grammar. How can people rely on their opinion, with regard to the precepts when they are always changing their mind, moving from one extreme to the other? They do this because there is not a single commandment fully explained in the Torah itself. I will note one example.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">The “one example” offered by I.E. is, “Nowhere in the Torah do we find the rules governing the establishment of the years nor how to calculate months.” However, he digresses before coming to the point.</i> Someone conversant with these things will recognize its significance because it entails the penalty of <i>karet</i> (shortened life span) with regard to eating on Yom Kippur, eating leaven on Passover and, for one who is in a state of ritual purity on Passover, not offering the paschal lamb.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">One who is “impure” on Passover is forbidden to sacrifice the paschal lamb. Cf. Num. 9:1-14. Our rendition is based on the Vatican manuscript of I.E. henceforth written <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. The printed texts read, “and leavened bread on Passover which one in a state of purity did not observe.” This is an impossible reading.</i> It also involves the seven rest days of the festivals,<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">There are seven festival days when work is Biblically prohibited. They are: the first and seventh day of Passover, Shavuoth, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, the first day of Sukkot and Shemini Atzereth.</i> the festival sacrifices, dwelling in booths and the sounding of the shofar. Nowhere in the Torah do we find clearly stated the rules governing the establishment of years nor how to calculate months. These wretched, poor in learning, find support for their calendric calculations in the verse <i>and let them be for signs, and for seasons (festivals)</i><sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for seasons is <i>mo’adim</i>. <i>Mo’adim</i> also means festivals. Genesis 1:14 reads, <i>Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven…and let them be for signs, and for seasons</i> (mo’adim). The Karaites interpreted this verse: Let them be for signs for the festival, i.e., let the moon (the lunar month) determine the time of the festivals.</i> (Gen. 1:14). But they don’t know that <i>Let them be</i> is in the plural and speaks about the sun, moon and stars.<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads <i>ve-hayu</i> not <i>ve-hayah</i>. <i>Ve-hayu</i> is a plural and so cannot refer only to the moon.</i> As to the person who says that the <i>vav</i> of <i>u-le-mo’adim</i> (and for seasons) is superfluous and that <i>for signs</i> is connected to <i>for seasons</i>,<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Aside from the above, the verse presents another problem for the Karaites. It does not read: and let them be for signs for seasons (festivals). It reads: and let them be for signs <i>and</i> for seasons (festivals). The Karaites tried to get around the problem by claiming that the <i>vav</i> of <i>u-le-mo’adim</i> is superfluous and should not be translated. <i>U-le-mo’adim</i> should be rendered: for seasons (festivals) rather than: and for seasons. Thus the verse is to be translated: And let them be for signs for seasons (festivals).</i> let him search for a friend to tell it to; perhaps he will believe it. If we do find two or three superfluous <i>vavs</i>, how do we know that this is one of them,<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. concedes that there are a few superfluous <i>vavs</i> in Scripture, but he asks, how do we know that this is one of them?</i> since we find thousands of <i>vavs</i> in Scripture which have meaning? Furthermore, the verse <i>Who appointedst the moon for seasons</i> (le-mo’adim) (Ps. 104:19) is not in accordance with the interpretation of those whose loins totter.<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 69:24. The Karaites interpreted Ps. 104:19 as meaning God appointed the moon for festivals.</i> Even if Scripture explicitly stated (which it never does) that the moon shall be for a sign for the appointed seasons (<i>mo’adim</i>) falling in the various months, how could we determine that the Bible speaks of God’s holy appointed seasons, since various types of appointed seasons are mentioned in the Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Holy Writings?<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">The point is if the Bible said: the moon shall determine the <i>mo’adim</i>, how do we know that the <i>mo’adim</i> refer to religious festivals? The word <i>mo’ed</i> may refer to any appointed time and does not necessarily refer to a religiously appointed one.</i> Furthermore, even if the Bible explicitly said: let the moon be as a sign for God’s holy seasons,<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the Bible explicitly stated the moon shall be for a sign for God’s holy festivals, it would not solve the problem as to what constitutes a month.</i> a very important aspect of the problem remains to be solved.<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">Namely, what constitutes a new moon (the beginning of a month)? In order to understand what follows it is necessary to have some idea of medieval astronomy. The daily movement of the moon varies between approximately 11 and 15 degrees in a rather complicated fashion. To explain these motions the ancients introduced a complex scheme of combined circular movements. (For a full discussion of this problem and the solution offered for it, see <i>Yale Judaica</i> series, Vol. XI, <i>The Code of Maimonides, Sanctification of the New Moon</i>, p. 126). Cherez explains that the moon was believed to move within four spheres. The first is called <i>galgal ha-domeh</i> (the all-encompasing sphere). It is so called because like the zodiacal sphere, it encompasses the whole world and like it has the earth as its center. This sphere turns from east to west. Within the all-encompassing sphere lies another sphere called <i>galgal ha-noteh</i> (the inclined sphere). This sphere is not contained within the <i>galgal ha-domeh</i> but intersects it. The chord connecting the points of intersection are called the <i>teli</i> (the dragon). The point at which the moon moves north of this intersection is called the head (or top) of the <i>teli</i>; its opposite point, where the moon moves south, is called the tail of the <i>teli</i>. The <i>galgal ha-noteh</i> is inclined five degrees above the <i>galgal ha-domeh</i> on the north and five degrees below it on the south, hence the term <i>galgal ha-noteh</i>. The center of this sphere is the same as that of the <i>galgal ha-domeh</i>. This sphere also turns in an east to west direction. Within the <i>galgal ha-noteh</i> is another sphere called the <i>galgal ha-yotze</i> (the eccentric sphere). It is so called because the earth is not the center of this sphere. It is also called the <i>galgal ha-noseh</i> (the carrying sphere) because it bears a sphere which the moon circles (the <i>galgal ha-katan</i> or epicycle). The <i>galgal ha-yotze</i> turns from west to east. These spheres move at different speeds and their movements explain the complicated motions of the moon.</i> Does a new moon start when the moon completes circling the sphere of the zodiac, i.e., every 27 days and some limited hours,<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">That is the time it takes the moon to return to a given point in the zodiac (Weiser). Medieval man believed that beyond the spheres of the moon, sun and planets there is a sphere containing the constellations. It takes the moon 27 and about a third of a day to complete this cycle (Weiser).</i> or when it completes circling the apogee of the eccentric sphere whose center is far from the center of the earth,<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">The time it takes the moon to complete its epicycle within the eccentric sphere, i.e., every 27 days and about 13 hours. So Cherez. However, his interpretation is questionable.</i> or when it completes circling the sphere of the dragon according to the calculation of the wise men because its epicycle turns in the opposite direction.<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">The moon in its epicycle turns from west to east while the “sphere of the dragon” rotates from east to west (Weiser). These contrary motions must be taken into consideration in establishing the time it takes the moon to complete the latter revolution. According to Krinsky what I.E. means by “the time it takes the moon to circle the sphere of the dragon” is the time it takes the moon to return to the head of the dragon after leaving it. It should be noted that the commentaries differ as to what I.E. means by the “sphere of the dragon,” as they do with regard to what he means by the moon’s cycle around the apogee of the “eccentric sphere” and indeed as to how I.E. envisioned the system of the lunar spheres cited in note 27. For their opinions and differences see, Joseph ben Eliezer Ha-Sephardi, <i>Margaliot Tuva</i>, Amsterdam, 1722; Hayyim Wolf Kaputa, <i>Or La-netivah</i>, Lemberg, 1897; Weiser and Cherez. While the specifics of I.E.’s comments are difficult to unravel, as is evidenced by the wide interpretation given his comments in the above-noted commentaries, the thrust of his remarks is clear. The moon makes a number of cycles in the sky. If a new moon is to be determined by the moon’s revolution, which one of its cycles is to determine the new moon?</i> On the other hand, it may be that the month depends upon the conjunction of the sun and the moon.<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">A Hebrew month is determined by the conjunction of the sun and moon. Cf. Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sanctification of the New Moon</i>, 6:1.</i> There are three such conjunctions: the mean conjunction,<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote">The mean conjunction of the sun and the moon takes place every 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 parts of an hour (dividing the hour into 1,080 parts). Cf. Weiser. The mean conjunction is the time when the sun and moon would come together if both moved uniformly.</i> the true conjunction<sup>33</sup><i class="footnote">The true conjunction of the sun and moon is their actual conjunction.</i> and the conjunction contingent on the place of the beholder.<sup>34</sup><i class="footnote">The conjunction varies in different places of the globe. See I.E.’s commentary on Ex. 12:2.</i> We do not know which conjunction determines the new moon; is it one or the other? As to that which they say, that the month begins when the new moon is actually seen, they have been deceived, for they have eyes but see not. Let them show us where in the Torah and the testimony<sup>35</sup><i class="footnote">A synonym for Torah.</i> it is stated that the new moon is to be so determined. Similarly they did not correctly comment on <i>This is the burnt-offering of every new moon throughout the months of the year</i> (Num. 28:14) because this verse does not mention the moon.<sup>36</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites interpreted <i>chodesh be-chodsho</i> to mean the moon when it is new. They claimed that <i>be-chodsho</i> is to be interpreted as <i>be-chiddusho</i> (when it is new). I.E. disagrees. He feels that <i>be-chodsho</i> means in its month, and furthermore, <i>chodesh</i> does not mean moon but month. Cf. I.E. on Num. 28:14.</i> It merely says that the various sacrifices are to be offered in their proper time and day and the Sabbath sacrifices on the Sabbath.<sup>37</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 28:10.</i> It is also known that sometimes there are six hours between the birth of the new moon and sunset. At such times the new moon can only be seen under certain astonomical conditions. At other times there may be a thirty hour difference between them,<sup>38</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the moon will not be visible at the first sunset following its conjunction with the sun.</i> and the moon will not be visible even to one standing on a mountain. This is so because the path of the moon changes due to its and the sun’s spheres.<sup>39</sup><i class="footnote">The ancients believed that the sun traveled around the earth. However, the earth was not the center of the sun’s orbit. When the sun is further from the earth, it appears to be traveling more slowly, when closer to the earth, faster (<i>Yale Judaica</i> series, Vol. XI, p. 126).</i> Its time of appearance also changes depending on the longitude and the latitude of the country from which it is observed. If it is cloudy and the new moon is not seen at the beginning of Elul or Tishri, shall we fast three days of atonement?<sup>40</sup><i class="footnote">The point is, if we do not rely on the traditional calculation and rely on the mean conjunction, then when for some reason the moon is not seen at the beginning of Elul we do not know when that month starts. If the same occurs with regard to Tishri, we have three possible dates for Yom Kippur, viz., when did Elul start and did it have 29 or 30 days? To satisfy all doubts we would have to fast three days in a row.</i> Furthermore, who says that a month consists of thirty days, for behold, Judah Ha-Parsi<sup>41</sup><i class="footnote">Judah Ha-Parsi was a Karaite who wrote a book claiming that the Pentateuch follows a solar year of 12 months, with each month consisting of 30 days. However, the Bible nowhere says that a month consists of 30 days. Cf. I.E.’s commentary on Ex. 12:2.</i> wrote a book in which he counted the year and the months according to a solar year. We also do not find in the Torah of Moses the law of witnesses testifying that they saw the new moon, or who is qualified to testify that he saw the new moon, or if one is permitted to walk a great distance on a holy day to testify that he saw the new moon,<sup>42</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 1:5-8.</i> or if a father and son, or proselytes, or women are fit to testify that they saw the new moon. Even if all these things were written in the Torah, another problem remains. The Torah of Moses does not state how many months make a year. And even though the Torah connects the new year with the fresh young ears<sup>43</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ex. 12:2, 13:4.</i> it is not clear whether it refers to the fresh young ears of the wheat<sup>44</sup><i class="footnote">The month of Sivan.</i> or barley,<sup>45</sup><i class="footnote">The month of Nisan.</i> or when during this period the new year is to start, or from where young fresh ears of barley are to be brought.<sup>46</sup><i class="footnote">Assuming that the new year starts with the ripening of the barley, what place is to determine its ripening and hence the spring? The barley ripens at different times in different places.</i> If there is a hunger in the land of Israel and its environs and there is no seed and certainly no fresh ears, what is to be done? In such a case shall we leave the year as it is or add an additional month?<sup>47</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps we ought to add another month and see if something will grow and there will be fresh young ears. Cf. Weiser.</i> In such a year the Omer would not be counted and there would be no festival of weeks.<sup>48</sup><i class="footnote">Since there is no barley. Cf. Lev. 23:9-22.</i> Therefore all these commandments are dependent on true traditions. Those who dispute what I have said and say, do not the sages of the Mishnah also teach that the months are determined by when the new moon is seen, to them I reply that if you accept their tradition as truth, that the month is determined by the sighting of the new moon, also accept their tradition that the needs of the people also determine the new moon. For the new moon is contingent upon its announcement by the Bet Din. The Bet Din took into consideration the time of the fresh young ears, the solstice and the needs of the community<sup>49</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 11b.</i> in determining whether to add an additional month. Why, with regard to the laws of plagues, which apply only to individuals and very rarely at that, does the Torah go into such great detail? And yet with regard to the laws of the calendar, which determine the festivals that apply to all Israel at all times, there is no clear-cut statement so that we must look for hints here and there as to how the month is to be determined. Why is this so in this perfect Torah? This is ironclad proof that Moses relied in these matters on the oral Torah which is a gladness to the heart and a healing to the bones. In reality, there is no difference between the written and oral <i>Torot</i>. They were both handed down to us by our ancestors. The Passover observed by King Hezekiah supports our faith in the Rabbinic tradition. It was done so on the advice of wise elders. Hezekiah did not offer the paschal lamb in its time and he presumed to eat leaven in the first month. He observed the “second Passover” for seven days, in a manner similar to the “first Passover.”<sup>50</sup><i class="footnote">Hezekiah put off the observance of Passover for a month upon the advice of “his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem.” Cf. II Chron. 30:2. This supports the teaching of the Oral Law to the effect that a Bet Din may delay observance of Passover for a month if it is felt that the needs of the community warrant it. Otherwise, Hezekiah would have been guilty of eating leaven on Passover. Furthermore, he would have invented a new way to celebrate the Second Passover. Cf. Num. 9:9-13. For the Second Passover is observed for one night and Hezekiah kept it for seven days. Since Hezekiah was a pious king we must assume that the festival he observed was not the Second Passover but the Passover itself after an extra month was added (intercalated) to the year.</i> There is ample proof that the Most High and Exalted One accepted what he did. This was so because his actions were based on the ruling of a Bet Din. There was no deceit in him.
The third approach is the way of darkness and gloom. It lies outside of the circle. This is the approach of those who invent secret explanations for everything in Scripture. They believe that the laws and statutes of the Torah are riddles.<sup>51</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes issue with those who interpret the Torah as allegories. In I.E.’s alternate commentary on the Pentateuch this group is identified as the Christians.</i> I will not expend much time answering them for, <i>they are a people who do err in their heart</i> (Ps. 95:10). The fact of the matter is that the laws of the Torah do not disagree with what is right.<sup>52</sup><i class="footnote">Krinsky. That is, all the laws of the Torah must make sense.</i> They are correct in only one thing, viz., that every precept, be it minor or major, must be weighed in the scale of one’s heart wherein the Eternal has planted some of his wisdom. Thus if there appears something in the Torah that is intellectually impossible to accept or contrary to the evidence of our senses, then we must search for a hidden meaning. This is so because intelligence is the basis of the Torah.<sup>53</sup><i class="footnote">Cherez.</i> The Torah was not given to ignoramuses. Man’s intelligence is the angel which mediates between him and his God. Thus anything in the Torah which does not contradict reason we must explain literally, take as it is written, and believe that it is so. We should not grope walls as the blind do, and interpret verses according to our subjective needs. Why should we turn what is evident into mysteries? Now if there are places with two meanings both of which are clearly true, one referring to the body and the other to the mind such as “circumcision of the flesh,”<sup>54</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 17:11.</i> and “uncircumcised of heart,”<sup>55</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 10:16. The point is the reason the flesh is circumcised is so that it will serve as a reminder to the Jew that there is a God above to whom he must submit. Thus the circumcision of the flesh serves as a reminder that one is to circumcise one’s heart. Now although this reason for the commandment of circumcision is (in the opinion of I.E.) self-evident it in no way negates the literal meaning of this law (Cherez). I.E. is vague. For additional interpretations see Weiser and Meijler.</i> and if there is a secret meaning to the <i>tree of life</i>, they are to be taken literally as well.<sup>56</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I.E.’s comments on Gen. 3:24.</i> Now if anyone cannot accept what I have said, if he be wise let him open his eyes. In nature, too, we find things that serve more than one purpose, such as the nostrils, the tongue, and the legs that serve two purposes.<sup>57</sup><i class="footnote">Hence a verse or a law may have a literal as well as a secret meaning.</i>
The fourth approach is close to the point, and a group of commentators have pursued it. This is the method adopted by the scholars in the land of the Greeks and Romans.<sup>58</sup><i class="footnote">The Christian world in contradistinction to those living in the Moslem world.</i> They do not rely on grammar but rather on Midrashic exegesis as do the books <i>Lekah Tov</i><sup>59</sup><i class="footnote">A “Midrashic commentary to the Pentateuch and the five scrolls composed by R. Tobiah ben Eliezer of Castoria (Bulgaria) in the 11th century.” (<i>Standard Jewish Encyclopedia</i>, N.Y., 1966.)</i> and <i>Or Enayim</i>.<sup>60</sup><i class="footnote">A Midrash composed by R. Meir of Castoria. R. Meir was a student of R. Tobiah ben Eliezer.</i> Since the interpretations quoted in these works are already found in the books of the ancients, why do these later interpreters tire us by writing them again?<sup>61</sup><i class="footnote">These books merely quote earlier Midrashic material. Weiser explains that I.E. was upset with these books because they kept people from comprehending the literal meaning of the text and from learning how to analyze the Bible from a grammatical point of view.</i> There are Midrashic interpretations that are, in reality, in keeping with the literal meaning of the text.<sup>62</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser. An alternate interpretation is: there are Midrashim which contradict each other.</i> There are other Midrashim that are not to be taken literally, they have a secret meaning, an example being the Midrash to the effect that the Torah pre-dated the world by two thousand years. This Midrash is true only according to its secret meaning. However, many do not understand it so. Actually, it is impossible to take this Midrashic statement literally because a year is made up of a given number of days, and the measure of the minute and the day is contingent upon the motion of the sphere.<sup>63</sup><i class="footnote">Medieval man believed that the earth is surrounded by a sphere, in which the sun, moon, planets and stars are embedded. Without these spheres and their contents there can be no time, for time is made up of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years (cf. I.E.’s alternate introduction).</i> Hence if there is no sphere there is no day, certainly not two days or a year or two thousand years. If one were to ask,<sup>64</sup><i class="footnote">This question is implied by anyone who takes literally the statement that the Torah existed two thousand years before the creation of the world.</i> what was the world like before creation, would he not be ashamed of himself for seeking an entity when as yet there was nothing in existence? Those who respond<sup>65</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they respond to I.E.’s insistence that the Rabbinic statement under discussion cannot be taken literally by saying: it can because there were other worlds in existence prior to this one.</i> by saying that God created other worlds before this one and that he created this world at a propitious time<sup>66</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 3, “Rabbi Judah bar Simon said, ‘Scripture states and there <i>was</i> evening’ (Gen. 1:5), this teaches that there was time before this…Rabbi Abahu said, ‘God created worlds and destroyed them until he created this one…’”</i> are offering an answer based on the <i>plummet of emptiness</i> (Is. 34:11). Similarly those who say that the Almighty brought the world into existence to show his might to man, the object of creation, have satisfied themselves with a miserable answer which takes into consideration only part of a larger problem. There is clear proof to all but the blind that only one-twelfth of the earth is inhabited. Furthermore, the entire earth is an insignificant dot in relation to the sphere over it<sup>67</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the lunar sphere which surrounds the earth (Cherez, Krinsky). The point is how can one maintain that man is the object of creation when he and the whole earth are insignificant dots in the universe.</i> and even less so to the uppermost sphere. The interpretation of <i>yom yom</i> (daily) (Prov. 8:30) as meaning two thousand years is also wrong from a purely exegetical point of view.<sup>68</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash states, “The Torah preceded the existence of the earth by two thousand years, this is what Scripture means by, <i>Then I was by Him, as a nursling; And I was daily</i> (yom yom) <i>all delight, Playing always before Him</i> (Prov. 8:30). Now a day of God consists of one thousand years, as it is written, <i>For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday</i> (yom etmol) (Ps. 90:4).” Hence <i>yom yom</i> means that the Torah was God’s delight for two thousand years (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i>, 8:2).</i> If the meaning of <i>yom yom</i> (day) was two thousand years, Scripture would have read: <i>yomayim</i> (two days) rather than <i>yom yom</i> (daily). This is so because the meaning of <i>yom yom</i> is daily. We similarly read, <i>ish ish</i> (what man soever) (Lev. 17:3) and <i>Blessed be the Lord day by day</i> (yom yom) (Ps. 68:20). Furthermore, the end of the verse <i>Playing always before him</i> proves the point.<sup>69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Playing always</i> means the same as <i>yom yom</i>; hence <i>yom yom</i> means daily not two thousand.</i> Additionally, Proverbs goes on to say, <i>Happy is the man, that hearkeneth to me, Watching daily</i> (yom yom) <i>at my gates</i> (Prov. 8:34). Now, if <i>yom yom</i> means two thousand years then it follows that we should observe the true Torah for two thousand years.<sup>70</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>yom yom</i> means two thousand years then Prov. 8:34 reads: Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, watching for two thousand years at my gates, i.e., observing the Torah for two thousand years. Since no one lives that long what purpose is there for Scripture to make such a statement? Hence <i>yom yom</i> cannot mean two thousand years.</i> Furthermore, the verse <i>For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday</i> (Ps. 90:4) speaks of man not of God.<sup>71</sup><i class="footnote">See note 68. I.E. disagrees with the rabbis who interpret <i>Thy sight</i> as God’s sight. According to I.E. <i>Thy sight</i> refers to man’s sight.</i> Those who are interested in the interpretation of this verse will find it in my commentary on Psalms.
There are also Midrashim whose main purpose is to relieve the mind tired by the study of a difficult and intricate <i>halakhah</i>.<sup>72</sup><i class="footnote">When the sages wanted to relieve their minds they engaged in fanciful Midrashim (Cherez). Cf. <i>Sabbath</i> 30b.</i> Other Midrashim are based upon well-known concepts. There are also Midrashim that are not according to <i>halakhah</i>. There are some Midrashim whose main purpose is to enlighten others.<sup>73</sup><i class="footnote">The composer of the Midrash knew the literal meaning of the verse. However, the literal meaning was beyond the comprehension of his audience; hence he composed a homiletic interpretation.</i> These Midrashim explain the Torah to the young. There is a bird that cannot see on sunny days and is able to see only at night because its eyes are dim.<sup>74</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly there are people who cannot be told the literal truth.</i> Among the Midrashim that are for the young is the one that says that the Torah opens with a <i>bet</i> because the word <i>berakhah</i> (blessing) opens with a <i>bet</i>. Now, the fact is that there are many curses that open with a <i>bet</i>, viz., <i>Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty</i> (bokek) <i>and maketh it waste</i> (bolekah) (Is. 24:1); <i>And I will lay it waste</i> (batah) (Is. 5:6); <i>And the grinders cease</i> (batelu) (Eccles. 12:3); <i>And as for his ordinances, they have not known them</i> (ba’al-yeda’um) (Ps. 147:20); <i>From the pit of corruption</i> (beli) (Is. 38:17); <i>Your clothes are not waxen old</i> (balu) (Deut. 29:4); <i>The Lord hath swallowed up</i> (billa) (Lam. 2:2); <i>The Lord did there confound</i> (balal) (Gen. 11:9); <i>and thrust thee through</i> (bittekukh) (Ezek. 16:40); <i>and despatch them</i> (bare) <i>them with their swords</i> (Ezek. 23:47); <i>between the parts thereof</i> (betarav) (Jer. 34:18); <i>contempt</i> (bizzayon) <i>and wrath</i> (Es. 1:18); <i>bring forth for terror</i> (behalah) (Is. 65:23); <i>I will make thee a terror</i> (ballahot) (Ezek. 26:21); <i>a base fellow</i> (beliyya’al) (II Sam. 20:1); <i>Baal-peor</i> (Deut. 4:3); <i>Bel boweth down</i> (Is. 46:1); <i>priests of the high places</i> (bamot) (I Kings 13:33).
As to the <i>resh</i>,<sup>75</sup><i class="footnote">There either was a Midrash which interpreted the <i>resh</i> this way, or I.E. points it out, should one so wish to interpret the <i>resh</i>.</i> if it stands for head as in <i>its head</i> (resheh) <i>was of fine gold</i> ((Dan. 2:32), it can also stand for evil (<i>ra</i>) as in <i>the wicked men</i> (ra) <i>and base fellows</i> (I Sam. 30:22).
Anyone with a little bit of intelligence and certainly one who has knowledge of the Torah can create his own Midrashim. The Midrashic interpretations are like clothes to the naked body.<sup>76</sup><i class="footnote">The body remains unchanged regardless of one’s dress.</i> Concerning such interpretations our sages of blessed memory said, <i>a verse never loses its literal meaning</i>.<sup>77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sabbath</i> 63a.</i>
One Midrash<sup>78</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. offers examples of a word being “dressed” in various garments.</i> interprets the word <i>bereshit</i> to mean that God created the world through the Torah, as it is written, <i>The Lord made me as the beginning</i> (reshit) <i>of His way</i> (Prov. 8:22).<sup>79</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 1:2, <i>God looked into the Torah and created the world</i>.</i> Another Midrash states that the world was created upon the leviathan, as it is written, <i>He is the beginning</i> (reshit) <i>of the ways of God</i> (Job. 40:19). Another Midrash states that the world was created so that God might be feared, as it is written, <i>The fear of the Lord is the beginning</i> (reshit) <i>of wisdom</i> (Ps. 111:10). Another Midrash states that the world was created because of the <i>bikkurim</i> (first fruits), as it is written, <i>The choicest</i> (reshit) <i>first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God</i> (Ex. 23:19).
Another Midrash asks, why does the Torah open with a <i>bet</i>? To teach that God is one. It is only His creation that has two (<i>bet</i>) aspects, i.e., matter and form.<sup>80</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, prior to creation there was only the <i>One</i>; after creation there came into being something with two aspects. The word <i>bet</i> also serve as the number two.</i> Another Midrashic reason given for the Torah opening with a <i>bet</i> is that the <i>bet</i> alludes to the two worlds.<sup>81</sup><i class="footnote">The earth and the eternal world.</i> Another Midrash asks, why does the Torah open with a <i>bet</i> followed by <i>resh, alef, shin</i> and finally by <i>yod tav</i>? It answers that Scripture teaches that the first Temple, which preceded the creation of heaven and earth,<sup>82</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pesachim</i> 54a.</i> will stand for 410 years and then be destroyed.<sup>83</sup><i class="footnote">The interpretation is as follows: <i>bet</i> stands for <i>bayit</i> (the Temple), <i>resh, alef, shin</i> stands for <i>rishon</i> (first). <i>Tav</i> is numerically equivalent to 400 and <i>yod</i> to 10, hence, the interpretation: the <i>bayit rishon</i> (first Temple) will stand for 410 years.</i> The Bible continues, <i>Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep</i> (v. 2). This means that darkness descended upon the earth following the removal of the Divine presence from the earth.<sup>84</sup><i class="footnote">When the Temple was destroyed.</i> However, all was not lost, for <i>(and) the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters</i> (v. 2); i.e., the spirit of wisdom and understanding rested on the expounders of the Torah which is likened to water.<sup>85</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Tikune Zohar</i> 30 reads, “What does, and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters, mean? Without a doubt it means that when the <i>Shikhinah</i> went into exile God’s spirit hovered over those who study the Torah.”</i> Ultimately God will say, <i>Let there be light</i> (v. 3); i.e., the Messianic age will come. At that time God will separate those who hope for the Lord’s salvation and those who do evil deeds in the dark.<sup>86</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of <i>And God divided the light from the darkness</i>, etc. (v. 4).</i>
Another Midrash interprets <i>bereshit</i> to be two words that mean that everything was created out of fire which is the foundation of all.<sup>87</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash apparently rearranges the word <i>bereshit</i> as <i>berit esh</i>, a covenant of fire. Cf. Weiser and Cherez. See also <i>Tikune Zohar</i> 22, which similarly interprets <i>bereshit</i>.</i> Another Midrash states that <i>bereshit</i> alludes to six, as in <i>six</i> (shit) <i>cubits</i> (Dan. 3:1).<sup>88</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash breaks up <i>bereshit</i> as follows: <i>bara</i> (he created) <i>shit</i> (six).</i> The six allude to the six compass points of every body. The numerical value of first letters of each word in the first verse of the Torah comes to 22. This alludes to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Similarly the seven letters in this verse allude to the seven vowels or to the seven planets.<sup>89</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the seven moving stars. They are: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon.</i> The first verse of the Torah has 28 letters corresponding to the 28 phases of the moon. The same is the case with the 28 “times” mentioned in Kohelet (Eccles. 3:2 and 8).
The Midrash also states that Genesis opens with a <i>bet</i> and closes with a <i>mem</i><sup>90</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bet</i> in Gen. 1:1, <i>bereshit</i>; the <i>mem</i> in Gen. 50:26, <i>mitzrayim</i>. <i>Mem bet</i> is numerically equivalent to 42.</i> because it alludes to the name of God<sup>91</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides in Chap. 1:62 of the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> writes, “There was also a name (of God) of 42 letters known among them. Every intelligent person knows that one word of 42 letters is impossible. But it was a phrase of several words which totaled 42 letters.”</i> enunciated by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement. The name was revealed to Moses at Sinai, as it is written, <i>The Lord is among them</i> (bam),<sup>92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bam (bet mem)</i> is numerically equivalent to 42.</i> <i>as in Sinai, in holiness</i> (Ps. 68:18). Another Midrash says that the Torah opens with <i>In the beginning</i> and closes with the word <i>Israel</i> because Israel was on God’s mind at the time of creation.<sup>93</sup><i class="footnote">“In the beginning…Israel,” cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 1:5.</i> The end of the matter is, there is no limit to Midrashic interpretations.
The fifth method is the one upon which I will base my commentary. It appears to me to be correct in the presence of God whom alone I fear. I will not show favoritism to anyone when it comes to interpreting the Torah.<sup>94</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. will take issue with accepted authorities when he feels they misinterpret the Biblical texts.</i> I will, to the utmost of my ability, try to understand grammatically every word and then do my best to explain it. Every word whose meaning the reader desires to know will be found explained the first time the word is encountered. For example, the meaning of sky (<i>shamayim</i>) will be given in the first verse of Genesis. This will apply to all terms. I will not make mention of the reasons offered by the Massorites<sup>95</sup><i class="footnote">“The commentators who sought to explain the cause of the deviations from normal orthography.” (M. Friedlander, <i>Ibn Ezra Literature</i>, Vol. III, London, 1877).</i> as to why certain words are at times spelled full and at other times defectively because all of their reasons are of a Midrashic nature. The fact is that Scripture sometimes fully and clearly spells out a word and at other times omits an unpronounced letter for the sake of brevity. Since the Massorites claim to be able to explain the reasons for full and defective spellings, let them tell us what spelling the scribes should have used in writing Scripture.<sup>96</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation is based on the reading in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i> Now Moses left out the <i>vav</i> of <i>yimlokh</i> (shall reign) in <i>The Lord shall reign</i> (yimlokh) (Ex. 15:18), whereas the editors of Proverbs spelled the word <i>yimlokh</i> with a <i>vav</i> in <i>For a servant when he reigned</i> (yimlokh) (Prov. 30:22). However, many years passed between Moses and the editors of Proverbs.<sup>97</sup><i class="footnote">The point being that one cannot expect consistency over such a long period.</i> Actually, the reason given by the Massorites for the different spellings of the same word are for children. I would also add that one who correctly interprets the Torah does not need to assume any scribal emendations.<sup>98</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 18:13.</i> It should also be noted that the Aramaic translation of the Torah accurately rendered the meaning of the Pentateuch and explained to us all its difficult parts. Now if at times he (the Aramaic translator, Onkelos) followed the Midrashim,<sup>99</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that Onkelos occasionally offers a Midrashic interpretation of a verse whose meaning is obvious. He does so to offer additional meanings to the text. In these instances no harm is done since the plain meaning is obvious.</i> although he knew the basics better than we, he did so in order to offer additional meanings to a given text where even the simple could grasp the plain meaning of the text.<sup>100</sup><i class="footnote">In such cases there is no chance of even a simpleton misunderstanding the literal meaning of a verse which Onkelos interprets Midrashically.</i> Thus he renders <i>iroh</i> (Gen. 49:11) not as foal but as his city, and <i>beni</i> (colt) as will build. He also renders <i>atono</i> (his ass’s colt) (<i>Ibid.</i>) as “the gate of the entrance” (<i>sha’ar ha-iton</i>).<sup>101</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ezek. 40:15. Onkelos renders <i>Binding his foal</i> (iroh) <i>unto the vine, And his ass’s colt</i> (beni atono) <i>unto the choice vine</i> as, Israel (the vine) will go round about His city (Jerusalem). Israel (the choice vine) will build (<i>beni</i>) His Temple (<i>atono</i>, connecting <i>atono</i> with <i>sha’ar ha-iton</i> in Ezek. 40:15).</i> No harm was done by this because the literal meaning of a verse is never negated by Midrashic interpretations for there are 70 faces to the Torah. However, with regard to verses which deal with laws, statutes and regulations, if we find two possible interpretations for a verse and one of them is in keeping with the interpretation of the transmitters of tradition,<sup>102</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbinic sages.</i> all of whom were righteous men, then without reservation and with all our might we will rely on the truth of their words.<sup>103</sup><i class="footnote">The point is, when the Rabbinic interpretation is in keeping with the meaning of the verse it must be accepted even if it is possible to interpret the verse differently. As to those instances where the Rabbinic interpretation contradicts the plain meaning of a verse, see I.E.’s comments on Gen. 1:26 and the notes thereto.</i> Heaven forbid that we should join the Sadducees who claim that the traditions of the Rabbinic sages contradict the literal meaning of Scripture and the rules of grammar. The fact of the matter is that our ancient sages are true and all their words are true. May the Lord God of truth lead his servant in the way of truth.





Chapter 1



Verse 1

IN THE BEGINNING. Our wise men<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew grammarians. See Ibn Janah, <i>Sefer ha-Rikmah</i>, 6:2.</i> taught that the letter <i>bet</i> (of <i>bereshit</i>, in the beginning) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The letter <i>bet</i> placed before the word <i>reshit</i> has no translatable meaning. According to Weiser it is there for emphasis. Our verse should thus be rendered: First God created heaven and earth.</i> They compare it to the <i>bet</i> in the word <i>ba-rishonah</i> (at the first) (Genesis 13:4). We know the <i>bet</i> in <i>ba-rishonah</i> to be superfluous for we find <i>they shall set forth first</i> (rishonah) (Numbers 2:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to this opinion <i>rishonah</i> and <i>ba-rishonah</i> mean the same. Hence the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-rishonah</i> is superfluous.</i> However, if this were so the <i>bet</i> (of <i>bereshit</i>) would be vocalized with a long <i>kamatz</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As is the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-rishonah</i>. The fact that the <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> proves that both cases are not exactly the same.</i> Other scholars maintain that the word <i>bereshit</i> is always in the construct and its meaning in our verse is: “In the beginning of the evening, or of the night, or of the darkness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The word or phrase that <i>bereshit</i> is connected to is missing and must be supplied by the reader. According to Cherez, I.E. is trying to explain why the superfluous <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> while that of <i>ba-rishonah</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>. The reason is that <i>bereshit</i> is in the construct and therefore is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>.</i> However, they have overlooked <i>And he chose a first part</i> (reshit) <i>for himself</i> (Deuteronomy 33:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Where the word <i>reshit</i> is in the absolute.</i> Others say that the <i>bet</i> of <i>bereshit</i> is a preposition.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew texts printed in our editions are most probably incorrect. We have followed <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38, which has <i>kli ta’am</i> rather than <i>bli ta’am</i>. For alternate interpretations see Filwarg, Weiser and Cherez.</i> They explain that Scripture intends to preclude the thought that heaven and earth were preexisting. Hence it states, <i>In the beginning</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bet</i> is there for emphasis. The meaning of the verse is: <i>In the</i> beginning, i.e., before anything was created, God created heaven and earth.</i> I believe that <i>bereshit</i> is in the construct, as in <i>In the beginning of</i> (bereshit) <i>the reign of Jehoiakim</i> (Jeremiah 26:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. agrees that <i>bereshit</i> is in the construct. He disagrees with the earlier quoted opinion only in maintaining that it is not always in the construct.</i> Don’t ask, how can a word in the construct be connected to a verb in the perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A noun is usually in the construct when connected to another noun, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> This presents no problem, for we find that very case in the verse <i>When the Lord spoke at first with Hosea</i> (Hosea 1:2),<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Techillat</i> (at first) is in the construct with <i>dibber</i> (spoke).</i> and in the verse <i>the city where David encamped</i> (Isaiah 29:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kiryat</i> (the city) is in the construct with <i>chanah</i> (encamped).</i> The meaning of <i>bereshit</i> will be explained in our comments on the next verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the explanation of what <i>bereshit</i> in the construct is to be connected to.</i>
CREATED. Most Biblical commentators explain that the word <i>bara</i> (created) indicates creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. <i>But if the Lord make</i> (yivra) <i>a new thing</i> (beri’ah) (Num. 16:30) is similar. However, they have overlooked <i>And God created</i> (va-yivra) <i>the great sea monsters</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">God obviously did not create the sea monsters <i>ex nihilo</i>, for the verse concludes, <i>and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed</i>, which shows that the sea monsters were created out of the water. Also, it is absurd to assume that on the fifth day of creation God would create sea monsters <i>ex nihilo</i>.</i> (Gen. 1:21) and the three times the word created is used in one verse, viz., <i>And God created</i> (va-yivra) <i>man in His own image, in the image of God created</i> (bara) <i>He him; male and female created</i> (bara) <i>He them</i> (Gen. 1:27). They also failed to consider <i>I form the light, and create darkness</i> (Is. 45:7) wherein darkness, which is the opposite of light, an existing entity, is described by the prophet as being created.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Darkness is the absence of light. Thus Isaiah uses the term created in the opposite sense of creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. In Isaiah it means the creation of nothing out of something (Krinsky). Hence <i>bara</i> does not necessarily imply creation <i>ex nihilo</i>.</i> The following is the precise explanation of the word <i>bara</i>. <i>Bara</i> has two meanings, one of which has been noted above.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to create or make.</i> The second<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to eat.</i> is found in the verse <i>neither did he eat</i> (bara) <i>bread with them</i> (II Samuel 12:17). However, in the latter case, an <i>alef</i> has been substituted for a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Most of our manuscripts of the Bible have <i>barah</i> with a <i>heh</i>. However, Ibn Ezra’s manuscript must have had <i>bara</i> with an <i>alef</i>. See also Jacob ben Haim’s edition of the Hebrew Bible, 1524, which has the same reading as Ibn Ezra. There is some difficulty in understanding this comment as the printed text is corrupt. We have followed <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 as suggested by Weiser. For a different rendering see Filwarg.</i> The reason is that <i>bara</i> (in I Sam. 12:17) is similar to <i>le-havrot</i> (to urge to eat) in <i>And all the people came to cause David to eat</i> (le-havrot) <i>bread</i> (II Sam. 3:35). The verb <i>le-havrot</i> appears in the <i>hifil</i> (and its root ends with <i>heh</i>), for if it ended with an <i>alef</i>, Scripture would have read <i>le-havri</i>, as in <i>to make yourselves fat</i> (le-havri’achem) <i>with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel</i> (I Sam. 2:29). We also find <i>bara</i> conjugated in the <i>pi’el</i>, as in <i>and cut down</i> (u-vereta) <i>for thyself (trees)</i> (Joshua 17:15). This is not like the similar word <i>beru</i> in <i>choose</i> (beru) <i>you a man for you</i> (I Sam. 17:8) but rather like <i>bare</i> (hack, dispatch) in <i>and dispatch them</i> (u-vare) <i>with their swords</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Janah, <i>The Book of Roots</i>, root <i>bet, resh, alef</i>, explains <i>bara</i> in Josh. 17:15 to mean chose, as in I Sam. 17:8. Ibn Ezra disagrees. The point of I.E’s comment is that <i>bara</i> spelled <i>bet, resh, alef</i> primarily means to cut. It is encountered with this meaning in both the <i>kal</i> and <i>pi’el</i>. <i>Bara</i> also means to eat. However, in the latter case its root is <i>bet, resh, heh</i>, although it is found spelled <i>bet, resh, alef</i> in I Sam. 17:8. In the latter instance, however, we treat it as if there were an interchange between the <i>heh</i> and <i>alef</i>.</i> (Ezekiel 23:47). The meaning of <i>bara</i> is to cut or to set a boundary. The intelligent person will understand what I am alluding to.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I. Husik, <i>A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy</i>, p. 190, notes, “The Hebrew word <i>bara</i>, ordinarily translated “created,” which implies to most people the idea of <i>creatio ex nihilo</i>, Ibn Ezra renders, in accordance with its etymology, to limit, to define, by drawing or incising a line or boundary. Having said this, Ibn Ezra, in his wonted mysterious manner, stops short, refusing to say more, and preferring to mystify the reader by adding the tantalizing phrase, ‘The intelligent will understand.’ He means apparently to indicate that an eternal matter was endowed with form.” Nahman Krochmal, <i>More Nevuche Ha-zeman</i> (quoted by Krinsky), suggests that Ibn Ezra’s belief is similar to that of the Kabbalists; i.e., the world was created out of an emanation from God. See also C. Sirot, <i>Philosophy in the Middle Ages</i> (Hebrew), p. 112. Ibn Ezra was a neo-Platonist. According to neo-Platonism the world came about by emanation from God. Ibn Ezra is apparently saying that at the creation spoken of in the first chapter of Genesis, God gave final form to what had previously emanated from Him.</i>
GOD. <i>Elohim</i> (God) is a plural. We know this because we come across the singular form <i>Elo’ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 114:7. <i>Elo’ah</i> being the singular of <i>Elohim</i>.</i> <i>Elohim</i> is employed stylistically. Every language has honorific terminology. In the non-Hebrew tongues when an inferior addresses a superior he employs the plural. In Arabic it is customary for a dignitary such as a king to speak in the plural. In Hebrew, too, it is considered a sign of dignity to employ the plural when speaking of a superior. Such is the case with the words <i>adonim</i> (lords) and <i>be’alim</i> (owners). Thus Scripture says, <i>a cruel lord</i> (adonim) (Is. 19:4),<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Adonim</i> is a plural, yet its meaning in this verse is singular (lord). The singular of <i>adonim</i> is <i>adon</i>.</i> and <i>and the owner thereof</i> (be’alav) <i>shall accept it</i> (Exodus 22:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be’alav</i> literally means, its owners.</i> The terms <i>alav</i> (upon him), <i>elav</i> (to him), and <i>adav</i> (unto him) are similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">All of these words have plural endings, yet are used to indicate singulars.</i> It is for this reason that Scipture reads <i>bara Elohim</i> and not <i>bare’u Elohim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Elohim</i> is to be understood as singular, the verb following it (<i>bara</i>) is in the singular. If <i>Elohim</i> were plural, the verb following it would also be plural (<i>bare’u</i>).</i> We know from the study of logic that speech is called <i>safah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Safah</i> is the Hebrew word for lip. The point is that more than the lips are involved in speech, but speech is so called because it is seen to come from the lips.</i> because it is seen to come from the lips. Similarly man’s highest soul is called heart (<i>lev</i>) even though the soul itself is incorporeal while the heart is corporeal. It is referred to in this manner because the heart is its first resting place. Similarly God is called <i>Elohim</i> because His actions are executed via angels who do His will and who are referred to as <i>Elohim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Man’s soul is often referred to in Scripture as <i>lev</i> because the soul acts via the heart. Similarly God is called <i>Elohim</i> because He acts via the angels. Husik, p. 191, points out that according to I.E., “God cannot come in contact with the material and changeable (hence)…it follows that (the terrestrial world)…was not made directly by him, but by angels; hence the word <i>Elohim</i> is used in the first chapter of Genesis, which means primarily the angels, and secondarily God as acting through the angels.”</i> I will explain part of the secret of God’s name when I comment on <i>for My name is in him</i> (Ex. 23:21). Pay no heed to the opinion of Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who holds that man is superior to the angels. I have already explained to you in <i>The Book of Foundation</i> that all of his proofs are wrong. We know that the prophets are the most exalted human beings. Nevertheless, the prophet Joshua fell upon his face and prostrated himself before God’s angel and said to him, <i>What saith my lord unto his servant</i> (Josh. 5:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua’s bowing before God’s angels proves that angels are superior to prophets.</i> The same is true of the prophets Zechariah and Daniel.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Both address the angels as superiors. See Zechariah 1:9 and Dan. 10:17.</i> Why should I elaborate when this point is so elementary?The meaning of Lord of Hosts (<i>Elohe ha-tzeva’ot</i>) is the same as <i>God of gods</i> (<i>Elohe ha-Elohim</i>) (Deut. 10:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that <i>Elohim</i> means the same as <i>tzeva’ot</i> (hosts or angels).</i> The definition of <i>elohim</i> (lord) is angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>malakh</i> (angel) rather than <i>melekh</i> (king) (Weiser).</i> People engaged in the dispensation of God’s justice are also called <i>elohim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbinic interpretation <i>Elohim</i> at times signifies a judge. See <i>Mekhilta</i> on Ex. 21:6.</i> <i>Elohim</i> is an adjective, not a proper noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it can be declined and be in the construct. A proper noun cannot. I.E. seems to limit the term noun to proper nouns. Apparently common nouns were treated like adjectives.</i> It is not found conjugated in the perfect or imperfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew adjectives have verbal forms. However, <i>Elohim</i> is never found in the verbal form. Nevertheless, Ibn Ezra insists that it is an adjective.</i> One should not assume that angels are composed of fire and air because Scripture states, <i>Who makest winds Thy messengers, The flaming fire Thy ministers</i> (Psalms 104:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies that God makes his angels out of wind.</i> This is not the literal meaning of this verse. David (in Psalm 104) speaks first of creation. He starts with light and says, <i>Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment</i> (Ps. 104:2). He then goes on to say, <i>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain</i>, heaven referring to the firmament upon which is water, fire, snow and wind. David next says that the wind serves as God’s agent; i.e., it goes wherever God sends it. He speaks in a similar vein of fire as one of God’s ministers.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 104. It is not to be taken as implying that the angels are made out of fire. It rather means that fire is God’s agent. Cf. Ibn Ezra on Ps. 104:4.</i> David then says, <i>Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations</i> (Ps. 104:5), which refers to dry land. Similarly it is written, <i>Stormy wind, fulfilling His word</i> (Ps. 148:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that the wind is God’s agent. Krinsky suggests that this quote is misplaced and should follow, “it (the winds) goes wherever God sends it.”</i>
<i>Et</i> indicates the very thing. It signifies the direct object, as in <i>the heaven</i> (et ha-shamayim).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 1:1. The word <i>et</i> is a most difficult word to translate because it has many different meanings, depending on the context.</i> However, sometimes it is omitted, as in <i>that God created man</i> (Deut. 4:32). It is also found placed before the subject, as in <i>and when there came a lion, or</i> (ve-et) <i>a bear</i> (I Sam. 17:34). However, the latter usage is very rare. Furthermore, <i>et</i> is used in place of with or from.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ex. 2:21; 9:29.</i>
THE HEAVEN. The definite article (<i>ha</i>) is placed before heaven (<i>shamayim</i>) to indicate that Scripture speaks of the heaven visible to man.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the firmament. According to I.E. there is a heaven above the firmament which is invisible to man. This heaven is eternal. It contains the spheres in which the planets and constellations are embodied. Above this heaven is the abode of the angels. Cf. Husik, p. 190.</i> Heaven (<i>shamayim</i>) is always written in the plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>shamayim</i> (heaven) is a plural.</i> It is possible that <i>its dominion</i> in <i>Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens</i>? <i>Canst thou establish its dominion over the earth</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse <i>its dominion</i> is in the singular. Since <i>shamayim</i> is a plural, we would expect “their dominion” rather than “its dominion.”</i> (Job 38:33) refers to the dominion exercised by each one of the heavenly spheres.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See note 40 above. See also Ibn Ezra’s Introduction, page XVII, second paragraph.</i> The meaning of <i>shamayim</i> (heaven) is high and above, as it is in Arabic, a language akin in form to Hebrew. There is also a heaven of heavens.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 148:4. Scripture in our chapter speaks of the visible heaven. However, in Psalm 148 it speaks of the “heaven of heavens.” The <i>heaven of heavens</i> is the spheres (Krinsky). See note 40.</i> The word for heaven (<i>shamayim</i>) is never written in the singular.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Even if the reference is to one of the heavens.</i> It is like the words millstone (<i>rechayim</i>) and noon (<i>tzohorayim</i>). Those who are well-versed in geometry will understand these secrets.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">They will understand the reference to the heaven of heavens.</i> Saadiah Gaon says that the earth may be compared to a point and the heaven to a thread circling it. Since Scripture tells us that heaven and earth were created, we deduce from this that all their contents, such as fire and water, were also created.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not explicitly mention the creation of fire and water, two of the four elements. However, according to Saadiah the creation of these two elements is implied. There was no need for Scripture to mention their creation as their creation is self evident. For how could the fire and water, which filled the void between heaven and earth, be in existence before the creation of their container? Cf. I.E.’s alternate commentary on this verse in Weiser, p. 145.</i> Others say that the earth includes water and the heaven air.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture does state that these two elements were created.</i> However, in my opinion the heaven and earth spoken of in our verse refer only to the firmament and the dry land.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 1:1 does not tell us that God created heaven and earth on the first day; neither does it deal with the creation of matter. I.E. will explain the meaning of this verse later on in his comments.</i> For only one thing was created on each day. Thus light was created on the first day, the firmament on the second, plants on the third, luminaries on the fourth, and living creatures on the fifth and the sixth. This interpretation is borne out by the psalm quoted above (Psalm 104). It is impossible to maintain that the line circling the dot was created before the dot, or the dot before the circle. Hence our sages say that heaven and earth were created simultaneously.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hagigah</i> 12a.</i> They offer as proof of their viewpoint, <i>Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, And My right hand hath spread out the heavens; When I call unto them, They stand up together</i> (Is. 48:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>They stand up together</i> implies that they were created simultaneously.</i> However, this proof is questionable. The plain meaning of this verse is not so, for how could God address that which was not yet created?<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">How can the Bible say, “When I call unto them,” if they were not yet in being?</i> How could He call to that which was in a chaotic state? The explanation of this verse is as follows: I, God, created heaven and earth. When I call them, they stand before Me as servants ready to do My will. The meaning of this verse is similar to that of <i>Thy word standeth fast in heaven</i> (Ps. 119:89). After stating this the Psalmist makes mention of the earth (Ps. 119:90). He then goes on to say that heaven and earth stand ready to execute any commands that God will direct to them (Ps. 119:91).

Verse 2

NOW THE EARTH. The word <i>ha-aretz</i> (the earth) is irregular in that it is always vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath both the <i>heh</i> and the <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the word <i>eretz</i> (earth) is vocalized <i>aretz</i> when preceded by the definite article. The normal vocalization should be <i>ha-eretz</i>, with a <i>segol</i> beneath the <i>alef</i>.</i> It is unlike the word <i>ha-elef</i> (the thousand) in <i>Thou, O Solomon, shall have the thousand</i> (ha-elef) (Canticles 8:12); or <i>ha-even</i> (the stone) in <i>and this stone</i> (ha-even) (Gen. 28:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>elef</i> and <i>even</i> the <i>segol</i> remains in place even when preceded by the definite article.</i>
UNFORMED. Saadiah Gaon claims that the word <i>tohu</i> (unformed) is a derivative of <i>tehom</i> (the deep). This explanation is incorrect because the <i>mem</i> of <i>tehom</i> is a root letter<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the <i>mem</i> would not fall out. Thus <i>tohu</i> cannot derive from <i>tehom</i>.</i> like the <i>mem</i> of <i>hadom</i> (footstool).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mem</i> of <i>tehom</i> is similar to the <i>mem</i> of <i>hadom</i>. Both <i>mems</i> are integral parts of the respective words and do not drop out.</i> The <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> explains <i>tohu</i> (unformed) and <i>bohu</i> (void) as follows: <i>Tohu refers to the green line</i>; <i>bohu</i> alludes to the smooth stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Hagigah</i> 12a. “<i>Tohu</i> is a green band which encompasses the whole world, out of which darkness proceeds…, and tohu consists of the smooth stones in the abyss, out of which the waters proceed.”</i> However, the correct meaning of these terms is found in the Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Onkelos. The latter renders these terms as “waste and empty.”</i> We similarly read, <i>And in the waste</i> (tohu), <i>a howling wilderness</i> (Deut. 32:10), and <i>go after vain things</i> (tohu) (I Sam. 12:21), which means worshipping things that have no substance.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">That is, idols.</i>
[VOID.] <i>Bohu</i> is a synonym of <i>tohu</i>. The <i>vavs</i> of <i>tohu</i> and <i>bohu</i> are in place of a <i>heh</i>. They are like the <i>vav</i> in (<i>va-yishtachu</i>) (and he bowed)<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The final <i>vav</i> of <i>va-yishtachu</i> (and he bowed) is in place of a <i>heh</i>.</i> and the <i>vav</i> of <i>achu</i> (reed-grass) in <i>They fed in the reed-grass</i> (achu) (Gen. 41:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The final <i>vav</i> of <i>achu</i> (reed grass) is in place of a <i>heh</i>.</i> The meaning of our verses is this: When the creation of the firmament and the dry land took place, the earth was uninhabited because it was covered with water. God created the earth in such a way that by the laws of nature it would be below the waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Earth is the heaviest and water is the second heaviest of the four elements. Hence according to the laws of nature earth has the lowest position and water the next lowest. Thus at the beginning of creation the earth was covered with water. It took a special act of God to dry the land.</i> Do not reject this interpretation because of the <i>vav</i> that is placed before the words <i>the earth</i> (<i>ve-ha-aretz</i>), for its meaning is identical to that of the Arabic <i>fa</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-ha’aretz</i> (and the earth) introduces a new idea. This contradicts I.E.’s assertion that verse 2 is a mere continuation of verse 1, for I.E. interprets verse 1 and 2 as reading: When God made heaven and earth the earth was unformed and void. I.E. thus explains that the <i>vav</i> does not always mean “and” (it is like the Arabic <i>fa</i>). Thus verse 2 reads: the earth was, rather than: and the earth was.</i> The <i>vav</i> placed before the word mist (<i>ed</i>) in <i>but there went up a mist</i> (ve-ed) <i>from the earth</i> (Gen. 2:6)<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-ed</i> does not mean “and a mist.”</i> is analogous. Our verses are to be so interpreted because Moses did not speak of the eternal world, which is the world of the angels; he spoke only of the transient world.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">There were those who explained the sky in Gen. 1:1 as referring to heaven. Cf. <i>Hagigah</i> 12a; note 40 above. I.E. disagrees. He maintains that heaven in verse 1 refers only to the firmament.</i> How can those who say that the word heaven in the first verse refers to the highest heavens explain the presence of the earth in the same verse?<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>shamayim</i> does not refer to the firmament but rather to the abode of the heavenly beings, what, then, does earth refer to? It is illogical to assume that the Bible juxtaposes the creation of the eternal with the creation of the transient.</i> Intelligent people have reputable proof that there is only one earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps one will argue that earth refers to some spiritual earth, hence I.E.’s argument that unlike the heavens there is only one earth.</i> As to the Midrash, when it says that there are seven earths it means that the area of the world inhabited by human beings is divided into seven sections.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash is not to be taken literally. The seven earths are mentioned in <i>Zohar Chadash 1:216</i>.</i> The Holy Temple was in the center of the inhabited world.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash the Temple was in the center of the world. Cf. <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 48:2. Here too world means the inhabitable world and not the globe.</i> It was not in the center of the earth because we know that it was far from there.
AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD. <i>Ru’ach</i> (wind) is in the construct with <i>Elohim</i> (God) because it was the medium employed by God to dry the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>ru’ach</i> (spirit) as wind. Thus <i>ve-ru’ach Elohim</i> (and the spirit of God) means: and God’s wind.</i>
[THE WATERS.] <i>Mayim</i> (waters) is in the plural. It does not come in a singular form. It belongs to the dual forms,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Certain Hebrew words are found only in the dual forms, e.g., noon (<i>tzohorayim</i>), heaven (<i>shamayim</i>), ears (<i>oznayim</i>), hands (<i>yadayim</i>), legs (<i>raglayim</i>).</i> the latter being either masculine or feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Most of the words in dual form are feminine. However, I.E. points out that this is not necessarily so. <i>Waters</i> is in the masculine. A masculine noun may also come in the dual form (Filwarg). For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky.</i> <i>Mayim</i> is also found used in the singular in <i>the water of sprinkling was not dashed against him</i> (Num. 19:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Strictly speaking, if <i>mayim</i> is in the plural, the verb pertaining to it should also be in the plural. Hence, rather than “was not,” one would expect “were not.”</i>
[HOVERED.] <i>Merachefet</i> (hovered) means “blowing above the waters.” <i>As an eagle…Hovereth</i> (yerachef) <i>over her young</i> (Deut. 32:11), is similar.

Verse 3

AND GOD SAID. Saadiah Gaon interprets <i>va-yomer Elohim</i> (and God said), as and God wanted. However, if this were the case Scripture should have stated God wanted (said) light to be. Therefore <i>va-yomer Elohim</i> is to be rendered “and God said.”<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>va-yomer Elohim</i> means God wanted, rather than God said, Scripture should have used the infinite <i>li-heyot</i> in place of <i>yehi</i>; <i>Let there be</i> implies a statement.</i> We similarly read, <i>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made</i> (Ps. 33:6), and <i>For He commanded, and they were created</i> (Ps. 148:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Here creation is described as coming about by God’s word. The terms used are: spoke and command. It is absurd to translate these two words as wanted.</i> Scripture describes creation as coming about by God’s word because it wants to teach us that heaven and earth came into being without any labor on God’s part. We may compare this to a king assigning certain tasks to his servants.
[LIGHT.] The light spoken of in this verse was above the air.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">See note 88.</i>

Verse 4

AND GOD SAW THE LIGHT. “Saw” is to be understood here as perceived. Compare, <i>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly</i> (Ecclesiastes 2:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">I.E’s proof text may be Dan. 10:7, viz., <i>And I Daniel alone saw the vision</i>. I.E. reads, <i>and I saw</i>.</i>
The meaning of <i>divided</i> is: He divided them by naming one, day and the other, night.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">God divided light from darkness by giving each a name. This verse doesn’t speak of a physical division. Thus verse 5 explains how God divided the light from the darkness (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 5

AND GOD CALLED. The <i>heh</i> of <i>laylah</i> (night) is superfluous, because the word is penultimately accented. It is always a masculine noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>heh</i> of <i>laylah</i> (night) was an essential part of the word, <i>laylah</i> would be a feminine noun and would be accented on the last syllable (Filwarg).</i>
EVENING. <i>Erev</i> (evening) is close in meaning to <i>choshekh</i> (darkness). <i>Erev</i> is so called because forms are then intermingled.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The root of intermingle (<i>erev</i>) is <i>ayin, resh, bet</i>.</i> The opposite of evening is called <i>boker</i> (morning) because one can then distinguish between various forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bakker</i> means to examine. Cf. Lev. 27:33.</i> One day refers to the movement of the sphere.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The heavenly sphere made one revolution. The sun was not yet seen in the firmament; neither was there as yet a firmament. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> There is a secret meaning to the Midrashic statement to the effect that the world will exist for six thousand years.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 97a.</i> Once it is stated that God called the light “day,” it is impossible to maintain that the evening, too, is considered part of the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes issue with those who maintain that the evening is part of the day. According to I.E. day refers only to daylight. For the implications of this comment see Weiser.</i> 
The correct interpretation of <i>And there was evening and there was morning, one day</i> is that evening passed and the morning of the first day also came. If the intention of this verse is to teach that evening and morning make a day, then what is the meaning of <i>And there was evening and there was morning, a second day</i> (v. 8)?<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">If the intention of Scripture is to teach us that evening and morning make a day, why keep on repeating this with regard to the subsequent days? Hence Scripture is only describing what happened (Kaputa).</i>

Verse 6

AND GOD SAID. Saadiah Gaon says things about the firmament that are not so.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah says that the waters are congealed on the firmament in a manner similar to the albumen of an egg. Saadiah also identifies the firmament with heaven (Krinsky).</i> The correct interpretation of firmament (<i>raki’a</i>) is something spread out, as in <i>And they did beat</i> (va-yirakke’u) <i>the gold into thin plates</i> (Ex. 39:3); <i>Then did I beat them</i> (erka’em) (II Sam. 22:43); and similarly, <i>And spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in</i> (Is. 40:22). How precious are the words of he who said that the firmament begins at the point where the sun and the ocean merge.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>ketzot ha-shamayim</i>, as in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38, for <i>ketzot ha-shemesh</i>. Cf. <i>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chap. III.</i> The firmament is the air because when the light shone very strongly upon the earth and a wind dried off from the earth, the flame turned into the firmament.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently alludes here to “the light as the medium whereby the chaotic base elements were progressively transformed into their present form” (Levine). Fire was believed to be one of the primeval elements out of which the world was created. I.E. believed that this element “changed and became the <i>raki’a</i> (firmament)” (Cohen).</i> Similarly<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 104:2 describes the heaven (firmament) as being “stretched out like a curtain,” which agrees with I.E.’s interpretation that the firmament is “something spread out.” Furthermore, Psalm 104, like Gen. 1:6-10, first describes the creation of the sky and then that of the dry land.</i> the Psalmist states, <i>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; Who layest the beams of Thine upper chambers in the waters</i> (Ps. 104:2 and 3). The Psalmist then makes mention of the clouds and the wind and the establishment of the earth. The latter is above the waters. We thus read, <i>For He hath founded it (the earth) upon the seas</i> (Ps. 24:2), and <i>To Him that spread forth the earth above the waters</i> (Ps. 136:6). Similarly whoever goes to the ocean is said to be going down.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">For the earth is above the waters. Cf. Ps. 107:23.</i> The meaning of <i>(He) That calleth for the waters of the sea, And poureth them out upon the face of the earth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies that the waters are above the earth.</i> (Amos 5:8) is that God commands the waters of the sea to give birth to clouds, and, afterward, <i>And (He) poureth them out upon the face of the earth</i>.

Verse 7

AND GOD MADE. Dividing one thing from another is expressed by placing the preposition <i>ben</i> (between) before the first object and a <i>lamed</i> before the second, as in <i>And let it divide</i><sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads: <i>and let it divide between</i>.</i> <i>the waters</i> (ben mayim) <i>from the waters</i> (la-mayim) (Gen. 1:6) and <i>between the holy</i> (ben kodesh) <i>and the common</i> (le-chol) (Ezek. 44:23). It may also be expressed by placing the preposition (<i>ben</i>) before each one of the objects, as in our verse <i>and divided the waters</i><sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads: <i>and God divided between the waters</i>.</i> (ben ha-mayim) <i>which were under the firmament from the waters</i> (u-ven ha-mayim) <i>which were above the firmament</i>. And it is found with the word <i>ben</i> repeated and a <i>lamed</i> before the second object, as in <i>But your iniquities have separated Between you</i> (benekhem) <i>and your God</i> (le-ven elohekhem) (Is. 59:2).
[AND IT WAS SO.] This phrase is connected to the verse which follows it: <i>When it was so, God called the firmament heaven</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And it was so</i> is out of place following <i>And God made the firmament</i>. If he made it, then obviously it was so. Hence it does not apply to verse 7 but is connected to verse 8; viz., after the firmament came into being God called it heaven (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 8

AND GOD CALLED. There are five things which God named because there was then no man to name them. They are: light, darkness, heaven, earth and the seas. In addition, God named man.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture explicitly tells us that God named the Light, the Darkness, etc. I.E. points out that God also named Adam, even though this is not expressly stated in our chapter.</i>

Verse 9

AND GOD SAID. I believe that this chapter is connected to the one preceding it<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew Bible verses 6-8 and 9-13 form separate chapters. According to I.E. verse 9 does not start the account of the third day of creation, but is a continuation of verse 8. See note 99.</i> because the firmament did not come into being until the land dried.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Thus land was created on the second day and not on the third day.</i> Proof of this is Scripture’s statement, <i>In the day that the Lord God made earth (dry land) and heaven (the firmament)</i> (Gen. 2:4). Thus they were made on the same day. The revelation of something which had previously been hidden (the land) or the gathering of something which was scattered (the water) into one place is not a creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture (Gen. 2:4) states, <i>the Lord God made earth and heaven</i>, rather than the Lord God created earth and heaven. I.E. had previously commented that only one thing was created on each day. He therefore explains that the making of the firmament and dry land on one day does not constitute the creation of two things on the same day, for the drying of the land was not a creation.</i> The meaning of our verse is: now God had said, <i>Let the waters under the heaven be gathered</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And God said</i> is to be understood as a pluperfect. Verses 8 and 9 are to be read as one verse and understood as follows: And God called the firmament heaven…for God had said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place (Cohen).</i> There are hundreds of similar instances in the Torah. I will offer two examples from the portion of <i>Bereshit</i>. One is: <i>And the Lord God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed</i> (Gen. 2:8). After stating this, Scripture goes on to say, <i>And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight</i> (v. 9). However, God caused vegetation and trees to sprout before the creation of man.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">According to Gen. 1:11,12, vegetation was created before man. Therefore the meaning of Gen. 2:9 is: And out of the ground the Lord God had previously made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight.</i> The second example is when God commanded man not to eat from the tree of knowledge (Gen. 2:16). However, immediately after this it is written, <i>And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man</i>, etc. (Gen. 2:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that the beasts of the field were created after man. However, Gen. 1:25 tells us that man was created after the beasts of the field. Hence the meaning of <i>formed</i> in Gen. 2:19 is had formed, i.e., before creating man God had formed the beasts of the field and every fowl of the air.</i> The meaning of <i>formed</i> thus is had formed. According to this interpretation it follows that <i>And God saw that it was good</i> (Gen. 1:10) is connected to the act of creation which took place on the second day.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">The account describing the making of the sky and the earth concludes with Gen. 1:10, <i>And God saw that is was good</i>.</i> The account of the creation which took place on the third day thus begins with <i>And God said: Let the earth put forth grass</i> (Gen. 1:11).
[LET…BE GATHERED.] The meaning of <i>yikkavu</i> is let them come together. <i>Ve-nikvu</i> in <i>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all nations shall be gathered</i> (ve-nikvu) <i>unto it</i> (Jer. 3:17) is similar.

Verse 10

[SEAS.] Scripture employs the term seas (<i>yammim</i>) because there is no one name for the sea that surrounds all of the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra, in line with other medievalists, believed that there is one sea covering most of the earth. Thus he was faced with the problem of why Scripture doesn’t say God called the gathering of the waters “sea.” His guess was that the sea had different names in different places. Hence Scripture refers to it as seas. For an alternate interpretation see Filwarg.</i>

Verse 11

AND GOD SAID. Scripture states, <i>Let the earth put forth grass</i> (Gen. 1:11); <i>Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures</i> (Gen. 1:20); <i>Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind</i> (Gen. 1:24). This teaches that God placed in the earth and in the water the power to bring forth these things at God’s command. These are the generations (offspring) of the heaven and the earth (Gen. 2:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Filwarg. For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky.</i>
[LET THE EARTH PUT FORTH GRASS.] <i>Tadshe</i> means let it put forth.
WHEREIN IS THE SEED THEREOF. Wherein the seed is in the fruit and each one produces its own kind.

Verse 13



Verse 14

AND GOD SAID. <i>Yehi</i> (let there be) is short for <i>yiheyeh</i>. Due to the frequency with which this term is used, it is employed before both the singular and the plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Luminaries is a plural, so Scripture should have used the plural <i>yiheyu</i>, rather than the singular <i>yehi</i>.</i> It is also employed in Scripture with the feminine as in, <i>If there be a damsel</i> (yiheyeh) <i>that is a virgin</i> (Deut. 22:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Since damsel is a feminine, the verb <i>tiheyeh</i>, rather than <i>yiheyeh</i> (which is masculine), should have been used. I.E. points out that there is a tendency toward uniformity when a word is employed frequently.</i>
FOR SIGNS AND FOR SEASONS. <i>For signs</i>, i.e., for minutes, <i>and for seasons</i>, i.e., for hours. <i>For signs</i> may also be interpreted as referring to the eclipse of the moon and the sun and also to shooting stars. The last-mentioned phenomena are to be included among the signs produced by the lights of the firmament because they are caused by the stars. This meaning of signs is like signs in <i>And be not dismayed at the signs (omens) of heaven</i> (Jer. 10:2). Anyone who explains the <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-otot</i> (for signs) as superfluous is mistaken.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that the <i>lamed</i> is a preposition.</i>
AND LET THEM BE FOR SIGNS. A prominent Spanish sage<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Janah (Krinsky).</i> stated that the firmament is divided into eight parts, seven for the seven spheres of the seven stars and one for the constellations.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The eighth sphere is a sphere of the constellations. The seven “planets” are the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Each “planet” has its own sphere (Krinsky). Hence the firmament consists of eight parts. Heaven consists of the seven planets and the constellations. Thus according to the Spanish sage the firmament and heaven are identical.</i> However, this cannot be so because we know there is no body above the sphere of the constellations. Behold, Scripture explicitly states, <i>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven</i>, which clearly indicates that there is a heaven above the firmament. <i>The heaven of heavens</i> (Nehemiah 9:6) and <i>To Him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which are of old</i> (kedem) (Ps. 68:34) are similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>heaven of heavens</i> refers to the heaven above the firmament. It is I.E.’s belief that the planets and constellations are above the firmament (see note 40).</i> Note that the word <i>kedem</i> in the verse quoted above does not mean east but ancient.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kedem</i> may also mean east, but not here. If the verse alluded to the eastern sky it could not refer to the heaven above the firmament (the ancient heaven) which is invisible.</i> Indeed, Rabbi Saadiah Gaon, may the righteous be remembered for a blessing, was afraid to comment on this verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>kedem</i> means old. It implies that they are older than the earth and may even be eternal. Hence Saadiah refrains from commenting on this verse. See Krinsky.</i> It appears to me that the sun, the moon and other luminaries are called <i>lights in the firmament</i> because they are visible there.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the luminaries are not in the firmament. They are above it. Nevertheless, Scripture states that God placed them in the firmament because they shine through the firmament and thus appear to be there.</i>

Verse 15



Verse 16

AND GOD MADE. The sun and the moon are called the great lights in contradistinction to the stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">The term “two great lights” implies that both lights were of equal size, hence I.E.’s comment. Cf. Rashi’s comment on this verse.</i> Similarly the first three sons of Jesse are called the elders, in contrast to their younger brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously only one of them was the eldest.</i> In reality, Eliab, the first born, was the oldest of them all. As to the Midrash, which states <i>One was not greater than the other</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">That is, both the sun and the moon were the same size at creation. Cf. <i>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chap. VI.</i> there is a secret meaning to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrashic statement is not to be taken literally.</i>
[TO RULE THE DAY.] The sun rules during the day and not at night because it is not seen. Conversely, the light of the moon and stars are not seen during the day. One may ask, do not the astronomers teach that Jupiter and all the stars, with the exception of Mercury and Venus, are larger than the moon? Why, then, is it written <i>the great lights</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">The implication from Scripture is clearly that the moon is larger than the stars.</i> The answer is that the term great does not refer to size but to light, and the light of the moon is many times greater than their light because of its proximity to the earth. Thus we see that Scripture describes them as lights.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture calls the sun and the moon lights because it refers to the light given off by them and not to their physical size.</i>

Verse 17

AND GOD SET. Do not be surprised that Scripture states, <i>And God set</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">If the stars are above the firmament, why does Scripture state, <i>And God set them in the firmament</i> (Filwarg). According to Weiser the question is, “If the stars are set in the sky then why are they not visible there at all times?”</i> for the Bible also says, <i>I have set My bow in the cloud</i> (Gen. 9:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The rainbow only appears to be in the cloud (Krinsky). Weiser interprets, “The rainbow is not always visible there.” Even so Scripture states, <i>I have set My bow in the cloud</i> (Gen. 9:13).</i>

Verse 18

AND TO RULE. The day spoken of in the Torah begins at sunrise and lasts until sunset. Night begins when the stars are first visible. Those who say that night begins with the appearance of three stars are correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud (<i>Sabbath</i> 35b), night begins with the appearance of three stars.</i> Know that evening begins at sunset and lasts for one and a third hours, during which time a light-like appearance is seen in the clouds. Similarly morning dawns before sunrise.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Morning dawns one and a third hours before sunrise (Krinsky).</i> When the light of the sun shines during the day and the light of the moon at night, they separate between the light and the dark.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>and to divide the light from the darkness</i> refers to both the sun and the moon.</i>

Verse 19



Verse 20

AND GOD SAID. <i>Yishritzu</i> (let it swarm) is a transitive verb, as is <i>sharatz</i> (swarm) in <i>And the river shall bring forth swarms of frogs</i> (ve-sharatz) (Ex. 7:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">In Gen. 9:7 and Ex. 1:7 swarm is intransitive. I.E. points out that here and in Exodus it is transitive. Therefore swarm may be either a transitive or an intransitive verb (Weiser).</i> The meaning of <i>Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures and let fowl fly above the earth</i> is that the waters shall produce living beings that will immediately fly.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Filwarg.</i> The verse <i>And let fowl fly…in the open firmament of heaven</i> proves my interpretation of the firmament.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the firmament is the air or atmosphere, not heaven. See I.E.’s comments on verse 6. The birds fly in the air, not among the spheres; thus <i>raki’a</i> cannot be the domain of the spheres (Cherez).</i> Saadiah Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Filwarg explains that according to Saadiah the stars are in the firmament which is in motion. Thus the fowl fly along with the firmament. It should be noted that Saadiah identifies the firmament with heaven.</i> explains <i>al pene</i> (in the open) to mean with the face of. Hence, according to the Gaon, the heavens face down.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture says that the birds fly on the face of the firmament. Since, according to Saadiah, the fowl fly along with the face of the firmament (heaven), then the firmament (heaven) faces down. This is absurd and shows how wrong Saadiah is.</i> The <i>feh</i> of <i>ye’ofef</i> (let fly) is doubled like the <i>nun</i> in <i>yekhonen</i> (till He establish) (Is. 62:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>ayin vav</i> has its final letter doubled in the <i>pi’el</i>. The root of <i>ye’offe</i> f is <i>ayin</i>, <i>vav, peh</i>. The root of <i>yekhonen</i> is <i>caf, vav, nun</i>.</i>

Verse 21

AND GOD CREATED. The meaning of <i>romeset</i> (creepeth) is walks. Some are of the opinion that the <i>sin</i> of <i>romeset</i> is in place of a <i>samekh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>resh mem samekh</i> means to tread. Thus <i>romes</i> with a <i>sin</i> means the same as <i>romes</i> with a <i>samekh</i>.</i>

Verse 22

AND GOD BLESSED. The meaning of <i>Be fruitful, and multiply</i> is, “You shall be fruitful and you shall multiply.” <i>And die in the mount</i> (Deut. 32:50) is similar because it is not in one’s power to determine the time of one’s death.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And die in the mount</i> is to be rendered: and you shall die in the mount. For we cannot determine the time of our death. Similarly one can have intercourse but one cannot guarantee conception. Hence <i>Be fruitful, and multiply</i>, like <i>and die</i>, is not an imperative.</i>

Verse 23



Verse 24

AND GOD SAID. <i>Living creature</i> is a general term for what the fire, water and earth gave birth to.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">The basic elements according to medieval scientific belief.</i> It also includes man.
CATTLE. Domesticated beasts that are utilized by man for their needs, for riding and for food.

AND BEAST OF THE EARTH. Animals that are in the wilderness where there are no human settlements. The <i>vav</i> at the end of <i>ve-chayeto</i> (and beast of) is superfluous. It is like the <i>vav</i> of <i>le-mayeno</i> (into a fountain) in <i>into a fountain</i> (le-mayeno) of <i>waters</i> (Ps. 114:8), and the <i>vav</i> in <i>the son of</i> (beno) <i>Beor</i> (Num. 24:3).

Verse 25



Verse 26

LET US MAKE MAN. Some are of the opinion that <i>na’aseh</i> (let us make) is a <i>nifal</i> participle<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Na’aseh</i> is not a first person plural future <i>kal</i> but rather a <i>nifal</i> participle. This interpretation eliminates the problem of God using a plural form when speaking of Himself. The verse is to be read as follows: <i>And God said, Let a man be made</i> (Cherez).</i> and is to be compared to the same word in <i>Now that which was prepared</i> (na’aseh) <i>for one day</i> (Neh. 5:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Here <i>na’aseh</i> is definitely a <i>nifal</i> form.</i> They further say that <i>in our image, after our likeness</i> are the words of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">They interpret the verse as follows: God said, “Let a man be made.” Moses added: “in our image after our likeness,” i.e., in human form.

According to it the first quoted verse should have read, “Let a man be made.”<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>na’aseh adam</i> means “Let (<i>yehi</i>) a man be made,” then the text should read <i>yehi na’aseh adam</i>.</i> Similarly Scripture should have read, “He made him in his image.”<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is either to Gen. 9:6 (Netter) or 1:27 (Cherez). I.E.’s point is, why use such roundabout language to say that God made man in his (human) image when the Bible could have said this directly (Cherez). <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, “It should have stated, He made him in our image”; i.e., if “our image” relates to man’s image, 9:6 and 1:27 should have so read.</i> Furthermore, how can the <i>his</i> in <i>His image</i> (v. 27) refer to man? If this were the case then man had an image before he was created.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">If man was created in man’s image, then man had an image before he was created.

All living things have an image.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">The verse stresses man’s uniqueness; i.e., he was created in God’s image.

There is thus no reason to call Israel “His land.” Hence the Torah calls the land of Israel “His land” in order to stress its importance.</i> The Gaon also says that the word <i>na’aseh</i> (let us make) has the meaning of the singular even though it is in the plural because it is the plural of majesty.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore <i>Let us make</i> really means: I will make.</i> He offers as proof, <i>and we will give thee the other also</i> (Gen. 29:27); <i>and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king (Daniel 2:36); peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite</i> (nakkeh) <i>them</i> (Num. 22:6). However, these witnesses are false witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">These verbs are not examples of the plural of Majesty.</i> First of all, <i>and we will give thee</i> (ve-nittenah) (Gen. 29:27) is a <i>nifal</i> and its meaning is “the other will also be given thee.”<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">It is not a first person plural <i>kal</i>.</i> It is like the word <i>nittenah</i> (is given) in <i>and the city is given</i> (nittenah) (Jer. 32:24). The <i>vav</i> conversive changes <i>nittenah</i> (she was given) to “she will be given (<i>ve-nittenah</i>),” as is the case with every verb in the perfect which becomes an imperfect when a <i>vav</i> conversive is prefixed to it. Similarly <i>nakkeh bo</i> (we may smite them) (Num. 22:6) means, “I and my army will smite them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>nakkeh</i> is not a plural of majesty.</i> Further, <i>nakkeh</i> may be a <i>pi’el</i> infinitive<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>nun</i> of <i>nakkeh</i> (smite) is not the <i>nun</i> of the first person plural but is part of the root of the word <i>nakkeh</i>.

Note that all the works of creation came into being by God’s command for the sake of man. Scripture relates that the earth and water brought forth plants and all living creatures. After all plants and living creatures had been created, God said to the angels, <i>Let us make man</i>; i.e., We, rather than the earth and water, will occupy ourselves with his creation. We know that the Torah spoke the language of man,<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berekhot</i> 31b.</i> for it was given to humans who speak and hear. Now a human being cannot speak of things above or below him without employing human terminology. Hence Scripture uses such terms as the mouth of the earth (Num. 16:30), <i>the hand of the Jordan</i> (Num. 13:29),<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. translates: the side of the Jordan.</i> and <i>the head</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. translates: beginning.</i> <i>of the dust of the world</i> (Proverbs 8:26). Far be it from us to believe that God has an image.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">On the basis of our verses reading, <i>in our image, after our likeness</i>.</i> Scripture clearly refutes such a notion by stating, <i>To whom then will you liken Me, that I should be equal</i> (Is. 40:25). It is because man’s upper soul is eternal and is compared in its existence to God and because man’s soul is incorporeal and fills the body, which is a microcosm, in the same way that God fills the universe that Scripture states, <i>in our image, after our likeness</i>. May God’s name be blessed. He commenced with the macrocosm and concluded with the microcosm.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Man. The account of creation begins with the creation of the “large world,” the universe, and concludes with the creation of the “small world,” man. “Man is a microcosm, a universe in little, for like the great universe he consists of a body animated by a soul” (Husik, p. 191).</i> The prophet also says that he saw God’s glory appear in human form (Ezek. 1:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Ezekiel, like Moses, employed human terminology in speaking of God (Weiser).</i> God is one. He is the creator of all. He is all. I cannot explain further.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. “seems to favor the idea of eternal creation and maintenance of the universe, the relation of which to God is as the relation of speech to the speaker, which exists only so long as the speaker speaks. The moment he ceases speaking the sounds cease to exist” (Husik, p. 190). The mystery of God being “All” is difficult to comprehend and lends itself to misinterpretation. It might lead one to believe in pantheism.</i> Man was originally created with two faces;<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Hence there is no contradiction in Scripture stating, <i>created He him</i>, and then saying, <i>created He them</i> (Meijler). Weiser explains that I.E.’s interpretation is in keeping with the Rabbinic tradition that man was originally androgynous (<i>Erubin</i> 18a). Levine (p. 135) suggests that I.E. speaks of man’s dual nature; i.e., he has a body and a soul.</i> man is thus one but also two. <i>In the image of God</i> means in the image of the angels. Man was created both male and female.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">The angels are of only one sex, man is of two.

THE SIXTH DAY.

They similarly translate Deut. 25:4, <i>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox before he treadeth out the corn</i>, and render Ex. 12:15 as <i>howbeit before the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses</i>.</i> However, why go through all this trouble<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Why give the <i>bet</i> a novel meaning (before) when in fact “finished” does not imply that any work was done on the Sabbath.</i> when finishing work does not constitute an act. Saying God finished is equivalent to saying God did no work. This is the meaning of <i>God finished</i> and of <i>and He rested</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Both mean God did no work.</i>
<i>His work which He had made</i> refers to the work that he had done on Friday prior to the onset of the Sabbath. 
<i>And He rested on the seventh day from all His work</i> pertains to all creations that God brought into being.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In other words part A of verse 2 refers to Friday, part B to the six days of creation. This also explains the reason why part A of the verse reads, <i>His work</i> and part B, <i>all His work</i>. Thus part B complements part A and is not redundant (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 3

AND GOD BLESSED. A blessing means an increase in well being. On the Sabbath the body is blessed with a renewal of its reproductive strength and the soul with an increase in its intellectual and reasoning capabilities.
AND HALLOWED IT. No work was done on the Sabbath, in contrast to the other six days.
[WHICH GOD IN CREATING HAD MADE.] Its meaning is: God placed in the root of all the species the power to reproduce themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains <i>asher bara Elohim la’asot</i> (which God in creating had made) as follows: God created (<i>bara</i>) his creation in such a way that they would do (<i>la’asot</i>), i.e., reproduce themselves in the future. That is why <i>bara</i> is a perfect and <i>la’asot</i> is an infinitive (Cherez).</i> I disagree with the person who explains <i>la’asot</i> (had made) as having the same meaning as made<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They interpret <i>asher bara Elohim la’asot</i> to mean, which God created and made. They maintain that <i>la’asot</i>, an infinitive, is to be interpreted as <i>asah</i>, a perfect (Filwarg). They also do not differentiate between <i>bara</i> and <i>asah</i>, and interpret “made” in verse 2 as created (Filwarg, Krinsky). For I.E.’s interpretation of <i>bara</i> see Gen. 1:1; for <i>asah</i> see verse 4.</i> and who, furthermore, insists that created and made are synonymous. Saadiah Gaon explains that the blessing and the holiness spoken of in this verse refer to those who observe the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah the blessing refers not to the Sabbath but rather to those who observe the Sabbath. We have translated according to Nachmanides’ rendering of I.E., which had a <i>vav</i> before sanctified.</i> They will be blessed and sanctified.

Verse 4

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS. These are what they gave birth to.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. usually renders <i>toledot</i> as “accounts of.” Cf. Gen. 6:9; 37:1. Here <i>toledot</i> refers to what heaven and earth produced: trees, living creatures, man.</i>
WHEN THEY WERE CREATED. When the firmament came into being and the earth became visible.
[IN THE DAY THAT THE LORD GOD MADE.] <i>Be-yom asot</i> means in the day that God fixed.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains that <i>asah</i> (make) means “to fix in its final form.” When the firmament and the earth received their final form, God commanded them to produce offspring (<i>toledot</i>).</i> Proof of this can be seen in <i>and He hastened to dress it</i> (la-asot oto) (Gen. 18:7), and in <i>Whom I have created</i> which is then followed by <i>I have formed him</i>, and finally by <i>yea, I have made him</i> (asitiv) (Is. 43:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The prophet first speaks of creation (<i>berativ</i>) and last, of fixing in final form (<i>asitiv</i>).</i>

Verse 5

SHRUB. <i>Si’ach</i> (shrub) means a tree: so, too, in <i>Among the bushes</i> (sichim) <i>they bray</i> (Job 30:7). In my opinion <i>si’ach</i> refers to a fruit-bearing tree, because Scripture compares man to a tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture compares man to a fruit bearing tree. Cf.

Verse 6

A MIST. <i>Ed</i> (mist) means smoke.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. reads <i>ashan</i> (smoke). That is, a smoke-like substance went up from the earth. Weiser suggests reading <i>anan</i> (cloud) because smoke is out of place here since I.E. speaks of clouds.</i> <i>The day of their calamity</i> (yom edom) is similar (Deut. 32:35). An evil day is called a cloudy day and a day of thick darkness.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>yom ed</i> means a cloudy day, i.e., a dark day or day of calamity.</i> The meaning of our verse is that via the power of the lights a mist arose from the earth and watered it and caused it to bring forth vegetation. Saadiah Gaon explains as follows: “And no mist yet went up from the earth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah the word <i>lo</i> found in verse 5 also applies to this verse.</i>

Verse 7

THEN THE LORD GOD FORMED. Via the power of the lights.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is omitted in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. It has been suggested that a scribe mistakenly copied it from the previous note (Weiser).</i>
[FORMED.] <i>Va-yitzer</i> (formed) is a <i>kal</i>. It belongs to those verbs whose first root letter is a <i>yod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The root of this verb is therefore <i>yod, tzadi, resh</i>.</i> It is like <i>va-yiketz</i> in <i>And Noah awoke</i> (va-yiketz no’ach) (Gen. 9:24).
The meaning of <i>and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life</i> is that man lives through the nostrils. They remove the air heated by the heart and replace it with fresh air. Scripture says man became <i>nefesh chayyah</i> (a living soul)<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This very term is also used in describing the creation of animals. Cf. Gen. 1:24.</i> because like the animals he was immediately able to walk, and thus differed from babies subsequently born.

Verse 8

AND THE LORD GOD PLANTED. God had previously planted a garden in the eastern section of the world in a place called Eden. He now placed the man there.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>va-yitta</i> (planted) is a pluperfect.</i> The <i>bet</i> of <i>be-eden</i> (in Eden) in <i>in Eden the garden of God</i> (Ezek. 28:13) governs not only Eden but also garden.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is trying to solve the following problem. In Genesis, Scripture refers to a “garden” in Eden (<i>gan be-eden</i>). However, in Ezek. 28:13 the Bible states, <i>in Eden the garden of God</i>. The former implies that the garden is located in Eden, the latter that Eden is located in the garden, hence I.E.’s comment (Filwarg).</i> Its meaning thus is, in Eden, in the garden of God. <i>Even by the God</i> (me’el) of <i>thy father, who shall help thee and by</i> (ve-et) <i>the Almighty, who shall bless thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mem</i> of <i>me’el</i> is also to be placed before <i>ve’et</i> and it is to be read as if written <i>u-me’et</i>. Thus this verse is to be rendered: Even by the God (<i>me’el</i>) of thy father who shall help thee, and even by (<i>u-me’et</i>) the Almighty who shall bless thee.</i> (Gen. 49:25) is similar. There are many other such instances in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The technical term used by I.E. for this is <i>mesharet</i> (or <i>moshekh</i>) <i>atzmo ve-acher immo</i>. Friedlander explains this phrase as follows: “one word which stands for two” (literally, the word draws itself and another with it).</i>
[THE MAN.] There is a secret meaning as to why the definite article has been placed in front of Adam.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Adam is a proper noun and a proper noun does not have a definite article placed in front of it. As to the secret alluded to by I.E., Filwarg comments, “I do not understand what secret he is hinting at.” However, it appears that I.E. is hinting that “Adam” is a collective noun meaning mankind, the secret being that God placed mankind in the Garden of Eden. I.E. will later elaborate on this theme when he speaks of the secret meaning of the garden (Kaputa). Abravanel writes, “Ibn Ezra stirred the world by saying that the definite article which precedes the word “Adam” contains a secret. By this he means… (that) Adam should be understood as a noun designating the genus of mankind rather than an individual.”</i> The definite article is also found prefixed to <i>Menasheh</i> in <i>the half tribe of Manasseh</i> (shevet ha-menasheh)<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">According to Krinsky, I.E. is noting that a proper name which later becomes the name of a group may have a definite article placed in front of it. Thus Adam, although originally a proper noun, became a collective noun.</i> (Deut. 3:13) and before the word <i>Araunah</i> in <i>of Araunah the Jebusite</i> (II Sam. 24:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>araunah</i> is a collective noun.</i> It is also possible that the definite article is placed before Adam because the word <i>adam</i> is derived from the word used for ground (<i>adamah</i>). Hence the name Adam may be a proper name or an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Kimchi, II Sam. 24:16. In our case it is an adjective meaning the one taken from the ground, and thus has a definite article prefixed to it.</i>

Verse 9

AND OUT OF THE GROUND MADE THE LORD TO GROW. When God made the trees grow from the ground throughout the world he did the same in the Garden of Eden, but there he placed two trees not found anywhere else in the world.
AND THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE. In my opinion the phrase <i>and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</i> is to be understood as if written, “And the tree of the knowledge, knowledge of good and evil,” because the word knowledge has a definite article prefixed to it and thus cannot be in the construct.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A word in the construct cannot have a definite article placed before it.</i> <i>The ark of the covenant</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Ark has a definite article placed in front of it.

Hence the phrase is to be read as if written, even the prophecy, prophecy of Oded the prophet.</i> are similar. There are many other similar instances in Scripture.

Verse 10

AND A RIVER. Before man was created the river watered the garden on all sides.
[HEADS.] The <i>alef</i> in the word <i>roshim</i> (heads) is a root letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">However, it is silent. There are times when the <i>alef</i> is not a root letter, e.g., <i>the tillage of the poor</i> (rashim) (Prov. 13:23). The <i>alef</i> of <i>rashim</i> (the poor) is not part of the word’s stem (Filwarg).</i> In <i>marashotekhem</i> (headtires)<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">According to Weiser. For other readings and the problems inherent in them see Filwarg.</i> (Jer. 13:18) the <i>alef</i> is enunciated. The meaning of <i>marashotekhem</i> is your headtires.

Verse 11

THE NAME OF THE FIRST. Saadiah Gaon identifies Pishon with the Nile. But it is known that the Gihon<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The second river flowing out of the garden.</i> is close to the land of Israel, for Scripture states, <i>And bring him (Solomon)…down to Gihon…and…anoint him there king over Israel</i> (I Kings 1:33,34). It (the Gihon) flows from southeast of the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Garden of Eden is located in the east (v. 8). Furthermore, according to I.E. the Garden of Eden lies south of the equator and the land of Israel is north of the equator. Thus the Gihon flows from the southeast of the land of Israel (Krinsky). Actually the Gihon is not a river but a spring located in the valley of Jehoshaphat. Here as in other places in his commentary I.E. errs with regard to geographical knowledge of the land of Israel.</i> The same is true of the Euphrates (Perat), which marks the furthermost eastern boundary of the land of Israel. The commentaries also tell us that the Tigris (Chiddekel) is another river, in addition to the Euphrates, that flows through Baghdad. Thus these three rivers (the Gihon, the Euphrates and the Tigris) lie east of the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, in contradistinction to the Gaon, the Pishon, too, must lie east of the land of Israel (Krinsky). However, the Nile is west of the land of Israel.</i> Furthermore, the source of the Nile is in the mountain of Frankincense far south of the equator. Proof of this can be seen by the fact that its waters swell in the summer.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">“For when it is summer time in the northern hemisphere, it is the time of the rainy season in the southern hemisphere. Thus the Nile, the source of which is in the southern hemisphere, swells during the summer” Chevel, <i>Ramban, Commentary on the Torah</i>, Vol. I, p. 86, note 414.</i> We know that the Garden of Eden is below the equator where day and night are always equal. Fools question this and ask, how is this possible?<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For day and night to be equal.</i> However, there is positive proof that this is so. Thus according to Saadiah one must believe that the Pishon (the Nile) flows from the Garden of Eden, which is in the east, toward the mountain of Frankincense, which is in the southwest, and then flows north.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Nile flows from the south to the north. The Garden of Eden is south of the equator toward the east. Thus if the source of the Nile is in the garden it must make this circuit.</i> There is, in fact, no proof that the Pishon is the Nile. Indeed, Saadiah translates the <i>land of Havilah</i> which the Pishon compasses to fit in with his translation of the Pishon as being the Nile. The fact of the matter is that he had no tradition concerning these things. He did the same with families, states, animals, fowl and precious stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever Saadiah came across an unfamiliar term he translated it as he saw fit. He explained Havilah as referring to Egypt because he translated Pishon as the Nile.</i> Perhaps these things were revealed to him in a dream. He definitely erred in a number of them as I will point out in their proper place.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I.E., Ex. 28:9 and Lev. 11:13.</i> So we will not rely on his dreams. Perhaps he did so out of respect for the honor of God, for he translated the Torah into Arabic language and script and he did not want the Arabs to think that there are parts of Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Most texts of I.E. have the word <i>mitzvot</i> (commandments) instead of <i>millot</i> (words).</i> which we do not understand. Scripture mentions that there is gold in the land of Havilah in order to glorify the river coming out of the Garden of Eden.

Verse 12

AND THE GOLD. Saadiah Gaon renders <i>bedolach</i> (bedellium) as pearls. He compares manna to them. However, Scripture merely says that manna had the color of <i>bedolach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Not that it was identical to it. Saadiah says that <i>bedolach</i> resembles manna. As manna is round, so are <i>bedolach</i> round. This strengthens his interpretation that <i>bedolach</i> means pearls, for the Bible says that the appearance of the manna was like <i>bedolach</i> (Cherez).</i> (Num. 11:7). The Gaon also says that <i>shoham</i> (onyx) is a precious clear white stone. The fact of the matter is that we do not know the precise meaning of either of these two items.

Verse 13



Verse 14

[TOWARD THE EAST OF ASSHUR.] The <i>tav</i> of <i>kidmat</i> (toward the east of) is in place of a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>kidmat</i> is <i>kedemah</i> in the construct.</i> The difference between <i>kedem</i> and <i>kedemah</i> is that the <i>heh</i> suffixed to <i>kedemah</i> is in place of the preposition “to” (<i>el</i>), which is vocalized with a <i>segol</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In other words <i>kedemah</i> means to the east, <i>kedem</i>, east.</i> Similarly in <i>and Abram went down into Egypt</i> (mitzraymah) (Gen. 12:10), <i>mitzraymah</i> means “to Egypt.” <i>Kidmat asshur</i> thus means <i>toward the east of Asshur</i>. Note that from the first verse of the Torah until the word <i>made</i> (Gen. 2:3), Scripture refers to the Deity as <i>Elohim</i>. Afterward, the honored and revered name (the Tetragrammaton) is coupled with it. How precious are the words of the ancients of blessed memory who said that the complete name of God is used over a complete world. Prior to the completion of creation there was no power to receive this name.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Creation came to an end with the making of man. The use of the Tetragrammaton is proper only with reference to man. See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 4:1 and Gen. 1:26.</i> If God grants me life I will explain the secret of the Tetragrammaton when I comment upon the first Torah portion of the book of Exodus. I will then explain its meaning in the absolute and in the construct. Note that the location of the ground from which Adam was created was close to the Garden of Eden.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hence man was not created in the garden. The commentaries assume that man walked to the Garden of Eden. According to Rabbinic tradition man came to the garden on the very day that he was created, hence I.E.’s comment that Adam was created close to the Garden of Eden (Krinsky).</i> I note this because some say that Adam was created out of the ground of the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The Kuzari</i>, 2:14.</i> They have overlooked <i>And it came to pass, as they journeyed east</i> (Gen. 11:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>From the east</i>. The garden was located in the east (v. 8). The tower of Babel was built after the survivors of the flood journeyed from the east (Gen. 11:2). We know that the ark rested on Mt. Ararat (Gen. 8:4); thus Mt. Ararat lies in the east (See I.E. on Gen. 11:2). Mt. Ararat (in the east) is far from the borders of Israel. Hence the Garden of Eden (in the east), too, must be far from the land of Israel.</i>

Verse 15

INTO THE GARDEN OF EDEN. <i>Gan</i> (garden) can be both masculine and feminine,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The pronominal suffixes of the verbs <i>to toil</i> and <i>to keep</i> are in the feminine.</i> hence the plurals <i>gannim</i> and <i>gannot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For the feminine plural form of garden see Eccles. 2:5. For the masculine plural form see Cant. 4:15. <i>Gannim</i> is masculine plural; <i>gannot</i>, feminine plural.</i> We ask those who maintain that the words <i>to till (dress) it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. translates “to dress it.” The literal meaning of <i>le-ovedah</i> is to till it. Till fits in better with I.E.’s comment.</i> <i>and to keep it</i> (le-ovdah u-le-shomrah) refer to the ground (<i>adamah</i>), how it is possible to till and keep a large area from a small one.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">If Adam’s task was to till and keep the soil outside the garden, then how was it possible for Adam to do this while he was in the garden? The land outside of the garden obviously extended for many miles. It would thus be impossible for Adam to live in the garden and tend the land outside of the garden. The pronominal suffixes (it) of <i>le-ovdah</i> and of <i>le-shomrah</i> are in the feminine. Those who say that these words refer to the ground do so because they believe <i>gan</i> to be masculine while ground is feminine. However, I.E. maintains that <i>gan</i> can be either masculine or feminine. Thus <i>le-ovdah u-le-shomrah</i> can refer to <i>gan</i>.</i> Furthermore, after Adam sinned God expelled him from the garden and commanded him to till the soil. But according to their interpretation he was already tilling the soil while he was living in the Garden of Eden.
<i>To till it</i> (le-ovdah) therefore refers to the garden of whose fruit he ate. It was only after he sinned that he had to eat the grass of the ground, i.e., bread. <i>To till it</i> means to water it. <i>To keep it</i> means to guard the garden so that no animals enter therein and befoul it. Some say that <i>le-ovdah</i> means to serve God’s commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i> on this verse. The root of the word till, <i>ayin, bet, dalet</i>, is also used in reference to worship (Deut. 6:13; 10:20).</i> However, a commandment is not served.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">While the root <i>ayin, bet, dalet</i> is used in referring to worship, it is not used in Scripture as a technical term for the practice of a precept. The term used for the latter is <i>lishmor</i> (to keep) (Deut. 8:1; 10:13). One serves (<i>oved</i>) God and observes (<i>shomer</i>) the commandments. One cannot be said to serve the commandments, hence I.E.’s objection to this interpretation.</i>

Verse 16

AND THE LORD GOD COMMANDED THE MAN. The verb <i>tzivvah</i> (command) with the preposition <i>al</i> (upon) implies a prohibition. We similarly read, <i>I will also command</i> (atzavveh) <i>the clouds</i> (al he-avim) <i>That they rain no rain upon it</i> (Is. 5:6).

Verse 17

[THOU SHALT NOT EAT OF IT.] Even though I (God) permitted you to eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, do not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term implies a commandment to eat of the other trees in the garden, hence I.E.’s comment (Krinsky).</i> One might ask, What need is there for the term <i>of it</i> after having stated <i>but of the tree of the knowledge…thou shalt not eat</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</i>. It would have sufficed to state, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat.</i> The answer is that the Bible elaborates. We find a similar case in <i>And she opened it, and saw it, even the child</i> (Ex. 2:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture should have stated, <i>And she opened it and saw the child</i>. The elaboration is there for emphasis (Weiser).</i> It is also possible that the term <i>of it</i> means even a part of it. You will find the exact grammatical explanation of the term <i>mi-mennu</i> (of it) in the <i>Sefer ha-yisod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">A Hebrew grammar composed by I.E. The book survives only in fragments.</i> Note that Adam was an intelligent being, for God would not direct commands to one who was unintelligent.

See I.E.’s comment on 3:6.</i> Don’t you see that Adam named every animal and fowl according to the nature of each of their respective species? Thus he was extremely intelligent. If Adam was unintelligent, God, knowing this, would not have brought His creatures to him to see what name he would give to each one of them. God also showed Adam the tree of knowledge, for his wife knew that it was in the midst of the garden.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not explicitly tell us that God told Adam exactly where the tree was. However, from Eve’s action we may surmise that He did. See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 3:6.</i>

A HELP MEET. <i>Help meet</i> should be understood in the light of <i>Two are better than one</i> (Eccles. 4:9).

[BUT FOR ADAM.] The meaning of <i>but for Adam he did not find a help meet</i> is that Adam did not find a helpmeet for himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. translates, <i>but for Adam there was not found a help meet</i>. However, the literal reading of the verse is: <i>but for Adam he did not find a help meet</i>. The question is, to whom does “he” refer? I.E. suggests it refers to Adam, not God. I.E. points out that the Bible occasionally uses a proper noun in instances where a reflexive pronoun is expected. Cf. David Kimchi’s commentary on this verse.</i> This is the way of the Hebrew language. Thus we find Samuel saying, <i>And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel</i> (I Sam. 12:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than saying “and me,” Samuel says, “and Samuel.” Here, too, rather than saying “but for himself he did not find a help meet” the Bible says, <i>but for Adam</i>.</i> It appears farfetched to me that <i>he did not find a help meet</i> refers to God. Scripture says here that the fowl were created out of the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 19.</i> However, it states above that they were created out of the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 1:20.</i> This is so because the fowl were created out of both earth and water.

Verse 21

AND THE LORD GOD CAUSED A DEEP SLEEP TO FALL. <i>Va-yappel</i> (caused to fall) is a <i>hifil</i>, as is <i>va-yashev</i> (drove away) in <i>and Abram drove them away</i> (Gen. 15:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Both <i>va-yashev</i> and <i>va-yappel</i> are <i>hifils</i> whose first root letter is a <i>nun</i>. The root of the former is <i>nun, shin, bet</i> and of the latter, <i>nun, peh, lamed</i>.</i>
A DEEP SLEEP. <i>Tardemah</i> is a deeper sleep than <i>shenah</i>, and <i>shenah</i> is a deeper sleep than <i>tenumah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">There are a number of Hebrew terms for sleep, <i>tardemah, shenah</i> and <i>tenumah</i>.</i> The <i>tav</i> of <i>tardemah</i> (deep sleep) is not part of its root.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The root being <i>resh, dalet, mem</i>.</i>
ONE OF HIS RIBS. Adam had two sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. translates <i>tzela</i> as rib, I.E. as side.</i> <i>Tzela</i> here is like <i>tzela</i> (side) in <i>and for the second side</i> (tzela) <i>of the tabernacle</i> (Ex. 26:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s comment is in keeping with the Rabbinic view (<i>Erubin</i> 18a) that man was originally created male and female. God then separated the one female side from the male side (Krinsky).</i> <i>Tzela</i> is a feminine noun. It means a side.
INSTEAD THEREOF. <i>Tachtennah</i> means in its place. <i>Tachtennah</i> (instead thereof) spelled with a superfluous <i>nun</i> is in the singular. <i>Tachtehah</i> is its plural form. <i>Tachteni</i> (under me) and <i>tachtai</i> (under me)<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. II Sam. 22:40; Ps. 18:40.</i> are similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tachteni</i>, the singular form, has the superfluous <i>nun</i>; <i>tachtai</i>, its plural form, does not (Weiser).</i>

Verse 22

MADE HE. <i>Va-yiven</i> (made me) is a <i>hifil</i> conjugation.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">This comment is difficult. <i>Va-yiven</i> is a <i>kal</i> conjugation. Krinsky and Weiser suggest deleting it. Indeed, some versions do. If it is retained then it must be explained as follows: <i>Va-yiven</i> (from the root <i>bet, nun, heh</i>) is short for <i>va-yivneh</i>. I.E. notes that this type of short form of a <i>lamed heh</i> root is found in the <i>hifil</i> and in the <i>kal</i> (Weiser). <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, <i>va-yiven</i> is a <i>kal</i>, as is <i>va-yifen</i>. This appears to be the correct reading.</i> We find similar instances with the <i>kal</i> conjugation in <i>va-yifen</i> (and he turned) (Ex. 7:23) and <i>va-yiken</i> (and he bought) (Gen. 33:19).
AND BROUGHT HER. When Adam awoke from his sleep he thought that the woman was brought<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The word brought is not to be taken literally. The woman was created next to Adam as he slept; thus she could not have been brought to Adam.</i> before him as the animals were brought before him. Scripture speaks of Adam’s thoughts. Similarly, <i>And the men pursued after them</i> (Josh. 2:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">The men thought that they were pursuing the Israelite spies. In reality they were not, for the spies were hidden by Rahab.</i> It is also possible that the woman was created outside of the garden and then was brought to Adam. When he looked around he knew that she had been cut from him, for one of his sides with its flesh was missing and he felt that it had been closed with other flesh.

Verse 23

AND THE MAN SAID. Then Adam said, “This time I have found a help meet like me for me, for this being came out of me.” The tradition concerning Lilith is a homily.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">There is a Rabbinic tradition that before the creation of Eve, Adam lived with the female demon Lilith. Hence he said, “This one, in contradistinction to Lilith, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.” Cf. L. Ginsberg, <i>Legends of the Jews</i>, Vol. I., p. 65.</i>
<i>Le-zot</i> (she) means because of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>lamed</i> in front of a word usually means to. <i>Zot</i> means this. Thus <i>le-zot</i> should be rendered to this. However, I.E. points out that the <i>lamed</i> may also mean because. The meaning of our verse then is: because of this; i.e., because she is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman,</i> <i>Say of me:</i> (li)<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>say to me</i>. Here, too, <i>li</i> does not mean to me but about me or of me.</i> <i>He is my brother</i> (Gen. 20:13) is similar.
[WOMAN.] The <i>shin</i> in the word <i>ishah</i> (woman) receives a <i>dagesh</i> in place of the inaudible <i>yod</i> which is found in the word <i>ish</i> (man).<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>dagesh</i> makes up for the <i>yod</i> which is missing in <i>ishah</i> (woman).</i> However, it is possible that <i>ishah</i> (woman) receives a <i>dagesh</i> to distinguish it from <i>ishah</i> (her husband) for at times the <i>dagesh</i> in the suffixed pronominal <i>heh</i> in <i>ishah</i> (her husband)<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">When the pronominal <i>heh</i> is sounded there is no doubt that the speaker intends to say <i>her husband</i>.</i> is not pronounced. The plural <i>nashim</i> (women) is derived from the words <i>enosh</i> (man) and <i>anashim</i> (men).<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The feminine plural is formed by adding a <i>vav</i> and a <i>tav</i> to the singular. However, the word for women (<i>nashim</i>) is not formed in this manner. It is not the word for woman (<i>ishah</i>) plus the plural ending, hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
[SHALL BE CALLED.] This refers to the name of the woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>yikkare ishah</i>. <i>Yikkare</i> (shall be called) is masculine and cannot refer to the woman. It refers to <i>shem</i> (name) which is masculine.</i>
[SHE WAS TAKEN.] The <i>dagesh</i> is omitted in the <i>kof</i> of <i>lukachah</i> (she was taken) in order to simplify its enunciation. This word is a <i>pu’al</i> conjugation even though we do not find it conjugated in the <i>pi’el</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pu’al</i> is the passive of <i>pi’el</i>. Thus if we find a word in the <i>pu’al</i> we would expect to find it in the <i>pi’el</i>. However, the root <i>lamed, kof, chet</i> is not found in the <i>pi’el</i>, hence I.E.’s comment. According to Hebrew grammer a <i>dagesh</i> is placed in the second radical of a <i>pu’al</i>.</i>
[AND THEY SHALL BE ONE FLESH.] This means they shall live together as if they were one flesh, or let them once again be one flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Man and woman were originally one flesh.</i> Some say they will be one flesh through the child they will produce.

Verse 25

NAKED. <i>Arummim</i> (naked) is an adjective. <i>And stripped the naked</i> (arummim) <i>of their clothing</i> (Job 22:6) is similar. Some say that <i>arum</i> (prudent) in <i>A prudent man</i> (arum) <i>seeth the evil and hideth himself</i> (Prov. 22:3) has essentially the same meaning. What the verse means is that the mind of the wise is uncovered (<i>arum</i>) and open to everything like the eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, a wise man is called <i>arum</i> because his mind is open (naked) to everything (Weiser).</i>

Chapter 3



Verse 1

NOW THE SERPENT. Some say that the woman understood and knew the language of the animals. They interpret <i>And the serpent said</i> as meaning, that the serpent spoke through signs.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the serpent did not actually speak. He conveyed his intentions through signs; i.e., he went to the tree and pantomimed the eating of the fruit thereof.</i> Others say that the serpent was in reality Satan.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Satan took the form of the serpent.</i> Now why don’t they look at what Scripture states at the close of this chapter (v. 14 and 15)? How is Satan to crawl upon his belly or eat the dust of the ground?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Satan is incorporeal and consequently cannot crawl on the ground or eat dust.</i> Furthermore, what meaning is there to the curse <i>they shall bruise thy head</i> if the reference is to Satan?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Man does not bruise Satan’s head. Hence the reference must be to a real serpent.</i> Many err and inquire why the serpent was cursed. They ask, was the serpent fully intelligent?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God would not punish a dumb animal.</i> Was he commanded by God to refrain from beguiling the woman?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">There is a Rabbinic dictum, “One who is not warned is not punished.”</i> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says since we know that only humans are intelligent and capable of speaking, we must conclude that neither the serpent nor Balaam’s ass spoke. He argues that in reality an angel spoke for them. However, Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni took issue with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni held that the serpent actually spoke. Some editions read: “with them,” i.e., with Saadiah and the others who do not interpret that the serpent actually spoke.</i> On the other hand, Rabbi Solomon ibn Gabirol, the great Spanish scholar and poet who wrote metered verse, arose and disagreed with Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni. It appears to me that we are to interpret the account of the serpent literally. The serpent spoke and walked in an upright position. The One who gave intelligence to man also gave it to the serpent. Scripture itself bears witness that the serpent, although not as intelligent as man, <i>was more subtle</i> (arum) <i>than any beast of the field</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1. Hence the serpent was responsible for his actions.</i> The meaning of <i>arum</i> (subtle) is wise, i.e., one who conducts his affairs intelligently. Now do not be surprised that Scripture uses the term <i>arum</i> (subtle, in v. 1) after <i>arummim</i> (naked in Gen. 2:25) when each of these words has a different meaning. Scripture is being poetic. Similarly, <i>With the jawbone of an ass</i> (ha-chamor), <i>heaps upon heaps</i> (chamor chamoratayim) (Judges 15:16), and <i>on thirty ass colts</i> (ayarim), <i>and they had thirty cities</i> (ayarim) (Jud. 10:4). Furthermore, if an angel spoke via the mouth of the serpent, then the serpent did not sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Why, then, was the serpent punished?

The use of the term <i>af ki</i> (yea) shows that the serpent spoke other things to the woman and that at the end of his conversation with her said, “yea much more so (<i>af ki</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. argues that <i>af ki</i> (yea) is a technical term used in a <i>kal ve-chomer</i>, an argument from a minor to a major premise.

The woman said, <i>God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die</i>.</i> The wife of Manoah did the same when she quoted the angel as saying, <i>for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death</i> (Jud. 13:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The angel had told her: <i>For the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb</i> (Jud. 13:5).

Verse 6

AND WHEN THE WOMAN SAW. In her heart.
AND THAT THE TREE WAS TO BE DESIRED. Because it had the power to make one wise, and her eyes would “open.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-haskil</i> has the meaning of because. Therefore <i>le-haskil</i> (to make one wise) is to be interpreted “because it made one wise” (Krinsky). Her eyes would open is to be interpreted metaphorically. See verses 5 and 7.</i>
[UNTO HER HUSBAND WITH HER.] The meaning of <i>with her</i> is that they ate together of the fruit and that she disclosed to him the secret that the serpent had revealed to her. Adam thus did not sin unwittingly and was therefore punished for violating God’s command. Many commentators say that the tree of knowledge was a fig tree. They base their assertion on <i>and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles</i> (v. 7).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70b, <i>By the very thing with which they sinned were they rectified</i>.</i> However, if this interpretation were correct, the Bible would say, “And they sewed leaves of the tree of the knowledge.” Many others say that it was a wheat plant.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 40a and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70b.</i> However, in my opinion the two trees in the midst of the garden were unique species not found anywhere else on the face of the earth. One of them, the tree of knowledge, possessed the power to instill sexual desire. Therefore the man and woman covered their nakedness. The meaning of <i>va-yitperu</i> (sewed) is well-known.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">It means sewn.</i> <i>Tafarti</i> in <i>I have sewed</i> (tafarti) <i>sackcloth upon my skin</i> (Job 16:15) is similar. Those who ask where Adam and Eve got a needle (to sew their girdle) emit hot air. Adam and Eve could have used a sharp piece of wood. Upon eating of the tree of knowledge, Adam knew (<i>yada</i>) his wife. <i>Yada</i> (knew) is a euphemism for sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is called “knowledge” because sexual desire came from the tree of knowledge. Moreover, a young man begins to have sexual desire at the age at which he begins to “know” good and evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the tree that implanted this new knowledge is called “the tree of knowledge of good and evil.”</i>
The <i>tree of life</i> extended life so that by partaking of it man would live for many years. <i>Le-olam</i> (v. 22) does not mean forever. We find this to be the case with the term <i>olam</i> in <i>and he shall serve him for ever</i> (le-olam) (Ex. 21:6),<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud it means until the jubilee. Cf. <i>Kiddushin</i> 15a.</i> and in <i>and there abide for ever</i> (I Sam. 1:22)<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">It can only mean for us as long as he lives. Therefore <i>va-chai le-olam</i> (and live forever, v. 22) is to be rendered, “and he will live for a very long time.”</i> and in many other verses,Some commentators insist that the verse <i>for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</i> (Gen. 2:17) indicates that man was created immortal and that he became mortal as a punishment for his sin. Many ask, what sin did Adam’s children commit that they were punished with death? Now this is absurd. Man and beast both share a common spirit (life force) through which they live and experience sensations in this world. As animals are destined to die, so must man die. The advantage of man over beast lies in the portion from above (the soul) which man has been granted. A Greek physician has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is impossible for man to live forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Galen, <i>Third section of the use of limbs</i> as quoted by Maimonides, <i>Guide to the Perplexed</i>, Part III, Chap. XII. I.E. maintains that man was not originally created immortal.</i>

Verse 7



Verse 8

AND THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LORD GOD WALKING. They heard the voice of God walking toward evening, at the time of the day when the breeze blows. Scripture employs the term <i>holekh</i> (walking) when referring to a voice as seen in <i>The sound thereof shall go</i> (yelekh) <i>like the serpent’s</i> (Jer. 46:22), and <i>And when the voice of the horn waxed</i> (holekh) <i>louder and louder</i> (Ex. 19:19). However, the Spanish grammarian, Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah, says that this verse is to be interpreted as follows: And they heard the voice of God as man was walking in the garden. He also interprets <i>the day</i> referred to in <i>for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</i> (Gen. 2:17)<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The problem with this verse is that Adam did not die on the day that he ate of the tree of knowledge.</i> as meaning a thousand years, as the Midrash does.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash states that a day of God is a thousand years. Thus what God was telling Adam was, “If you eat of the tree of knowledge you will die at the end of a thousand years.” Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 19:14.</i> Others say that Adam was created on a Friday and died on a Friday.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Thus he actually did die on the day that he ate of the tree of knowledge.</i> Others say that the meaning of <i>for in the day…thou shalt surely die</i> is that on that day you will incur the death penalty. Still others say that die at times means punishment, as seen in the verse <i>the man that hath done this deserveth to die</i> (II Sam. 12:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The man who took his neighbor’s sheep did not commit a capital crime.</i> Still others say the meaning of this verse is that on the day you eat of this tree you will begin to die. They bring proof from a child.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A cryptic comment. It is suggested that I.E. draws a parallel to a child who grows to sexual maturity and then begins to decline in physical strength (Krinsky). Filwarg rejects this interpretation by noting that physical decline does not set in with sexual maturity. However, it should be noted that medieval man believed that the emission of semen weakened the body and hastened its decline (see Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot De’ot</i>, Chap. 4). Thus man’s decline sets in with his sexual maturity. Since, according to I.E., man’s sexual maturity came with the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, his decline, too, started at this time.</i> According to my thinking the correct interpretation of this verse is to be found in the words of the Rabbinic sages who said that Adam repented.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Had Adam not repented, he would have died on the day he ate of the tree of knowledge. But he repented and thus was spared.</i> Their interpretation is in keeping with the words of Jeremiah who says, <i>At one instant I may speak concerning a nation…to destroy it, but if that nation turn from their evil.. J repent of the evil that I thought to do unto it</i> (Jer. 18:7, 8).

Verse 9

AND THE LORD GOD CALLED. <i>Where art thou</i> was a means of starting a conversation. Similarly, <i>Where is Abel thy brother</i>? (Gen. 4:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">God thus knew what happened to Abel. Hence <i>Where is Abel thy brother</i> was a means of starting a conversation. Similarly God knew where Adam was, and <i>Where art thou</i> was a means of starting a conversation.</i> Behold, Cain denied his brother’s whereabouts, but God responded, <i>the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the ground</i> (Gen. 4:10).

Verse 10



Verse 11

SHOULDEST NOT. <i>Bilti</i> with a <i>lamed</i> prefixed to it (<i>le-vilti</i>) means “not to.” Without this <i>lamed</i> (<i>bilti</i>) it means “only.”
EAT. <i>Akhol</i> (eat) is an infinitive. It is like <i>shemor</i> (keep) in<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemor</i> also is an infinitive.</i> <i>in not keeping</i> (shemor) <i>His commandments</i> (Deut. 8:11).

Verse 12

WHOM THOU GAVEST TO BE WITH ME. Thou gavest to me one who gave me the fruit to eat. The word <i>immadi</i> (to be with me) means the same as <i>immi</i> (with me). Its meaning is: to be with me in the garden. However, <i>immadi</i>, in contradistinction to <i>immi</i>, is found only in the first person singular.
AND I DID EAT. The <i>alef</i> of <i>va-okhel</i> (and I did eat) is a first person imperfect prefix. Its vowel (a <i>cholam</i>) takes the place of the <i>alef</i> of the root that has been dropped. The <i>khaf</i> is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i> because <i>and I did eat</i> comes at the end of a verse. A <i>vav</i> prefixed to a participle is always vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>, and never with a <i>kamatz</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that <i>va-okhel</i> is a first person perfect and not a participle. I.E. makes this point because a participle is vocalized with a <i>cholam</i> over the first radical and a <i>tzere</i> beneath the second radical. Hence <i>va-okhel</i> at first glance appears to be a participle. I.E. points out that this is not so. As a participle it would not have a <i>vav</i> with a <i>kamatz</i> affixed to it since a connective <i>vav</i> is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>. Since the <i>vav</i> of <i>va-okhel</i> has a <i>kamatz</i> beneath it, it must be a <i>vav</i> conversive, changing <i>okhal</i>, an imperfect, to <i>va-okhal</i>, a perfect. However, because <i>va-okhal</i> comes at the end of a sentence it is vocalized <i>va-okhel</i>.</i>

Verse 14

CURSED. The serpent was cursed with a short life.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Just as blessing is an addition of the good (see I.E. on Gen. 2:3), curse is a diminution of the good.

According to this interpretation <i>cursed art thou</i> refers to the serpent’s means of locomotion.</i>
UPON THY BELLY. <i>Gechonekha</i> (thy belly) means thy chest.

They similarly explain Gihon (Gen. 2:13). They also say that Pishon (Gen. 2:11) comes from the same root as <i>tafushu</i> (ye gambol) in <i>Because ye gambol</i> (tafushu) <i>as a heifer</i> (Jer. 50:11). Also, they say that Perat (the Euphrates, Gen. 2:14) comes from the same roots as <i>Be fruitful</i> (peru), <i>and multiply</i> (u-revu) (Gen. 1:28). But they are unable to cross the great river, the Chiddeckel (the Tigris) (Gen. 1:28), which stood before them.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">They were unable to derive it from one root.</i> They decided that it is made up of two words, <i>chad</i> (swift) and <i>kal</i> (light), and means the river whose waters are swift and light.

AND I WILL PUT ENMITY…THEY SHALL BRUISE THY HEAD. Her children shall smite thee upon thy head. <i>Yeshufeni</i> (bruise) in <i>He that would break me</i> (yeshufeni) <i>with a tempest</i> (Job 9:17) is similar to <i>yeshufekha</i> (shall bruise thee). Look at what follows and you will see that it is so.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The second part of the verse quoted from Job reads, <i>And multiply my wounds without cause</i>. This proves that the verb <i>yeshufeni</i> means he will bruise me, or smite me. Since <i>yeshufekha</i> and <i>yeshufeni</i> come from one root, they have one meaning. Hence <i>yeshufekha</i> means shall bruise thee.</i> A <i>bet</i> has been omitted from the word <i>rosh</i> (head) in <i>they shall bruise thy head</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads, <i>They shall bruise thee head</i>. With a <i>bet</i> it reads, <i>They shall bruise thee upon the head</i>. The <i>bet</i> is to be supplied by the reader.</i> We find the same in <i>into the house</i> (bet) <i>of the Lord</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The verse should read, <i>be-vet Adonai</i>. However, it reads, <i>bet Adonai</i>.</i> (II Kings 12:17).
HEEL. <i>Ekev</i> means the foot. If the head symbolizes the first, then the heel symbolizes the last. <i>Akevo</i> in <i>their rear</i> (akevo) <i>lying in wait on the west</i> (Josh. 8:13), is similar.

Verse 16

I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY. <i>Harbah</i> (multiply) is an infinitive.
THY PAIN. The pain a woman suffers when she is deflowered.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 34:12. The Bible speaks of pain and conception rather than conception and pain. Hence the pain spoken of by Scripture precedes the conception.</i>
AND THY TRAVAIL. The <i>nun</i> of <i>ve-heronekh</i> (and thy travail) is not a root letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The root of conceive is <i>heh, resh, heh</i>. <i>Herayon</i> refers to pregnancy and childbirth.</i> Pregnancy is considered by our verse to be a punishment because it and childbirth are a burden to women.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Elsewhere in Scripture pregnancy is considered to be a blessing, as seen in the verse <i>Blessings…of the womb</i> (Gen. 49:25).</i>
THY DESIRE. Thy obedience.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps I.E. understood <i>thy desire</i> to mean your husband’s desire will be your desire. Weiser suggests that the woman’s desire for her husband will be so strong that she will listen to everything that he commands her.</i> This means you will obey whatever your husband commands you for you are under his authority to do his will.

Verse 17

AND UNTO ADAM…CURSED IS THE GROUND. It will not yield much produce.
IN TOIL THOU SHALT EAT OF IT. This is short for thou shalt eat of its produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads, <i>thou shalt eat it (the ground)</i>.

The words “the food of” must be supplied by the reader.</i> is similar.

Verse 18

THORNS ALSO AND THISTLES. <i>Kotz</i> refers to large thorns. <i>Dardar</i> (thistles) are smaller than thorns. Its root is <i>dalet, resh</i> (<i>dar</i>). The other two letters of the word are not root letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">They indicate that the word is a diminutive, i.e., <i>dar</i> a thistle, <i>dardar</i> a small thistle (Filwarg). For alternate interpretations see Weiser. I.E. literally reads, <i>He lives</i> (dar) <i>alone, for his brother is missing</i> (ne’edar).</i>
[IN TOIL.] Thou shalt toil in opening, harrowing and sowing.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Is. 28:24.</i> In addition to this, man will also suffer the sick evil of finding thorns growing amidst the produce of the field.
[THE HERB OF THE FIELD.] Bread. For prior to this, man sustained himself with the fruits of the Garden of Eden.

Verse 19

[IN THE SWEAT OF THY FACE SHALT THOU EAT BREAD]. Unlike the animals, you will have to work at winnowing, grinding, kneading and cooking before you can eat. The meaning of <i>ze’at</i> (sweat of) can be ascertained from Rabbinic sources.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis often employ the term <i>ze’ah</i> for sweat.</i> It follows the paradigm of <i>shenah</i> (sleep). Its root is <i>yod, zayin, ayin</i>. <i>Ba-yazah</i> in <i>they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat</i> (ba-yazah) (Ezek. 44:18) is similar. The meaning of the verse is, they shall not come to sweat. We know that man is created out of the four elements. What, then, does Scripture mean by <i>for out of it (dust) was thou taken</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The four elements are: fire, air, water and earth. Why does Scripture only mention dust (earth)? At man’s death his body decomposes into all four elements (Krinsky).</i> The answer is that man’s skeletal frame is created out of earth (dust). Hence the bones are heavy<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Earth is the heaviest element. The Bible refers to the body as bones (Gen. 50:25) because they form man’s frame. Man is said to come from the earth because his bones are created out of dust.</i> and lack sensation. The skeletal frame is the foundation of the body. Look, Scripture states, <i>and the bones came together, bone to its bone</i> (Ezek. 37:7). The bones are like the frame of a house. Thus after the bones came together <i>and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above</i> (Ezek. 37:8). Similarly Scripture states, <i>and ye shall carry up my bones from hence</i> (Gen. 50:25).

Verse 20

EVE. The <i>yod</i> and <i>vav</i> are interchangeable.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible says that the woman was called <i>Chavvah</i> because she was the mother of all <i>chai</i>. If this is the case then she should have been called <i>chayyah</i>. Thus I.E. points out that the <i>vav</i> and <i>yod</i> interchange and that <i>chayyah</i> and <i>chavvah</i> are one and the same.</i> We thus find <i>hoyah</i> and <i>hoveh</i> interchanged in <i>behold, the hand of the Lord is upon</i> (hoyah) <i>thy cattle</i> (Ex. 9:3), and in <i>and thou wouldest be</i> (hoveh) <i>be their king</i> (Neh. 6:6). The reason she was called Chavvah and not Chayyah is to distinguish her name from the noun meaning animal (<i>chayyah</i>).
THE MOTHER OF ALL LIVING. Humans.

Verse 21

GARMENTS OF SKIN. Some say that Adam and Eve originally consisted of bone and flesh, and God now covered them with skin.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The problem which the commentaries found in this verse is, where did the skins to cover them come from? No animal was yet killed or had died so that its skin would be available for use as material for clothes (Filwarg).</i> Others say <i>garments of skin</i> means garments for their skin.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The garments were not made out of skin. They were garments for their skin. These commentators interpret as if written <i>le-or</i>.</i> Still others say that there exists an animal which has a form similar to that of man, and God commanded that it shed its skin.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the skin. The skin garments thus fitted man perfectly.</i> However, one should in reality not bother to inquire into this matter. We ought to believe that God made garments of skin for Adam and Eve. Who can recount all of God’s mighty acts? Who can tell of all of his wonders? There is no end to God’s greatness.

Verse 22

AND THE LORD GOD SAID…AS ONE OF US. When one (<i>echad</i>) is in the absolute, it has a cantillical note which indicates the foregoing and it is vocalized with a <i>segol</i> beneath the <i>alef</i>. However, when it is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>alef</i> (<i>achad</i>) it is in the construct. Similarly, <i>As one of</i> (ke-achad) <i>the tribes of Israel</i> (Gen. 49:16). Hence, according to the rules of grammar, the word <i>ke-achad</i> (as one of) cannot have the meaning of as one.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos interpreted <i>ke-achad</i> in this way: “Man has become one on earth.” Cf. Rashi. Man is one on earth as I am one in heaven. I.E. disagrees, for <i>ke-achad</i> is in the construct.</i> Additionally, if <i>ke-achad</i> is in the absolute, then it is meaningless.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>ke-achad</i> is in the absolute, then Scripture reads, man is like one. This is a meaningless statement.</i> Furthermore, if <i>ke-achad</i> is in the absolute, the notes should have connected <i>mi-mennu</i> (of us) to <i>la-da’at</i> (to know).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Not to <i>ke-achad</i>. A word in the absolute is not connected by a cantillical note to the word that follows. Since <i>ke-achad</i> is connected to <i>mi-mennu</i> it must be in the construct.</i> <i>Mi-mennu</i> is a plural,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos translates <i>mi-mennu</i> as a singular. 
The word <i>mi-mennu</i> can be rendered <i>of us</i> or <i>of him</i>.</i> as in <i>ish mi-mennu</i> (none of us) (Gen. 23:6). I have already explained in <i>The Book of Foundation</i> why the <i>nun</i> of <i>mi-mennu</i> receives a <i>dagesh</i> when in the plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>mi-mennu</i> should have been spelled with two <i>nuns</i>. The <i>dagesh</i> makes up for the missing <i>nun</i> (Weiser). I.E. makes this point here because the word <i>mi-mennu</i> has a <i>dagesh</i>. He does not want one to think mistakenly that it is a singular because of this <i>dagesh</i>. See next note.</i> The Babylonian grammarians who do not place a <i>dagesh</i> in it are in error.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian grammarians, in contradistinction to the Palestinian grammarians, place a <i>dagesh</i> in <i>mi-mennu</i> when it is singular and omit the <i>dagesh</i> when it is plural. I.E. says that the Palestinians who place a <i>dagesh</i> in both instances are correct.</i> The meaning of the verse (v. 22) is the same as <i>ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil</i> (v. 5).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Man has become like an angel. See I.E.’s comments on verse 5.</i> On the other hand, God might be saying what was in Adam’s mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Adam now thinks that he has become as one of us.</i> The use of the term <i>of us</i> presents no problem. It is similar to <i>Let us make man in our image</i> (Gen. 1:26) and <i>Come, let us go down</i> (Gen. 11:7). God in all these cases is addressing the angels.

Verse 23

THEREFORE THE LORD GOD SENT HIM FORTH. When the word <i>shelach</i> (sent forth) is followed by a <i>mem</i>, it has a negative connotation and means banished, as in <i>cast them out</i> (shalach) of <i>My sight</i> (Jer. 15:1). The great Spanish scholar who interpreted <i>sent him forth</i> in our verse in a positive way, as in <i>and Abraham went with them to bring them</i> (le-shallecham) <i>on the way</i> (Gen. 18:16), and in <i>and he hath sent him away</i> (va-yeshallechehu), <i>and he is gone in peace</i> (II Sam. 3:23), erred. For if he was right then the place Adam was going to was a better place than the Garden of Eden. If this sage should ask, if the meaning of <i>sent him forth</i> is he banished him, then why does Scripture go on to say, <i>So He drove out the man</i> (v. 24)?<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>sent forth</i> means <i>drove out</i>, then Scripture is being redundant.</i> The answer is that when man was driven from the garden (v. 4), God placed the cherubim at the east of the Garden of Eden.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">It does not relate that man was driven out, but rather tells that when man was driven out God did the following. It thus does not repeat verse 24.</i>
[THE CHERUBIM.] Some say that cherubim means like images of youths,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hagigah</i> 13b. The Talmud says that the Hebrew word <i>keruv</i> is like the Aramaic <i>ke-ravyah, ke</i> (like), <i>ravyah</i> (a child).</i> which is the translation of the Aramaic <i>ke-ravyah</i>. However, I believe that the word is a general term for any image. Ezekiel, who first says that he saw the image of an ox (Ezek. 1:10) and later speaks of a cherub (Ezek. 10:14), refers to one and the same image. The image was not changed from that of an ox to that of a cherub because an ox would be a reminder of the sin of the golden calf, as this sin was not committed in Ezekiel’s day.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hagigah</i> 13b states, “One verse says…<i>and they had the face of an ox</i> (Ezek. 1:10). Elsewhere it is written…<i>the face of a cherub</i> (Ezek. 10:14). Resh Lakish said: Ezekiel entreated concerning it and changed it into a cherub. He said before Him, Lord of the Universe, shall an accuser become an advocate.” I.E. notes that the Talmudic interpretation is not in keeping with the literal meaning of the Bible.</i> When Ezekiel speaks of <i>the</i> cherub (10:14) he has in mind the image he had mentioned previously (the image of an ox in 1:10). Therefore every image of an ox is a cherub, but not every cherub is an image of an ox. Proof of this is that Ezekiel refers to all images that he had seen as cherubim (10:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The image of a man, lion, ox and eagle</i> Our verse speaks of <i>the cherubim</i>, which implies the cherubim known to all, i.e., angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The form of the cherubim was known to Biblical man (Krinsky).</i> They had a flaming two-edged sword in their hands. The meaning of <i>which turned every way</i> is that the sword had two edges. Those who say that the flaming sword refers to the sun are incorrect.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Those who put forward this interpretation hold that the phrase refers to the great heat of the sun which guarded the garden (Weiser).</i>

Verse 24

AT THE EAST. <i>Mi-kedem</i> means at the east.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The entrance to the garden was at the east (Weiser).</i> Note, the story of the garden of Eden is to be interpreted literally. There is no doubt that it happened exactly as described in Scripture. Nevertheless, it also has a secret meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">This comment of I.E. is cryptic in the extreme. Our translation follows Weiser’s interpretation. Levine puts this comment of I.E. in the context of the latter’s philosophy. He writes that according to I.E., “wise persons recognize that their mission is to fulfill their soul’s will to return to the heavenly realm. Thus the will of a man controls the future of his soul. The will is not perfectly pure. Although man’s well being is contingent upon his making the correct choices, volition (<i>chefetz</i>, desire) frequently acts contrary to the intellect, due to the paradox of various faculties within man struggling for control. Volition (desire) is animated by the intellectual faculty but it is opposed by lust which originates from the appetitive and sensitive dimensions (Gen. 3:24).” Man’s goal in life is thus to seek “knowledge of God” and to subdue “all interfering passions” (p. 14).</i> It alludes to the following: Intellect (the Garden of Eden)<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Man’s intellect is his Garden of Eden (Kaputa).</i> gave birth to desire (the tree of knowledge). Desire gave birth to man’s actions. It is via his actions that man can elevate himself, for the force that propels his desire is in front of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The sexual organs, the source of man’s desire, is in front of man (Weiser). Perhaps what I.E. means by “his desire is in front of him” is that man can control himself.</i> The fig leaves prove this.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">They cover man’s sexual organs.</i> Man’s actions are also called the testing ground, for by them man is tried. Intellect and desire are only potential.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Man’s actions are actual. They show whether man is guided by his desires or by his intellect.</i> The one who understands the secrets of the tree of knowledge will understand the secret of the four rivers that divided into four parts (Gen. 2:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">According to some medieval philosophers, man’s brain is divided into four parts, each governing a different aspect of man’s mental life, i.e., sensation, imagination, judgment and memory. According to Kaputa, I.E. held similar ideas. What he is saying is that all these functions have one source, man’s intellect, his Garden of Eden.</i> This is the secret of the Garden of Eden and the garments of skin.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Man must control his desires.</i> There is also an allusion in all of this to man’s potential immortality (the tree of life). The intelligent will understand that this is the ultimate purpose of man’s life on earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Man is to live a life guided by his intellect so that he will attain immortality.</i>

Chapter 4



Verse 1

AND THE MAN. When Adam realized that he would not live forever he saw the need of perpetuating the human race. Eve concurred and therefore exclaimed, upon giving birth to a child, <i>I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God wanted the human race to go on. By producing a child Eve was doing God’s will, hence her remark (Krinsky).</i> Eve used the Tetragrammaton, and not the term <i>Elohim</i>, because the Lord’s spirit now rested upon the earth via the human race even as it does on the heavenly bodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Man is the only being on earth upon whom the Tetragrammaton rests.

This would give: God filled the whole with good.</i> refers to creation as a whole. We thus read, <i>And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good</i> (Gen. 1:31). Evil is found only in a part of creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to Netter, Krinsky, Cherez and Weiser, I.E.’s point is to tell us that good refers only to the species; i.e., the species is eternal; however, the individual must die. Cf. Maimonides, <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, Part III, Chap. 10, and I.E.’s introduction to Ecclesiastes. In the latter I.E. maintains that the little evil found in the world is overshadowed by the preponderance of good in creation.</i>

Verse 2



Verse 3

AND IN PROCESS OF TIME. That Cain tilled the soil, he brought an offering to the place that he had set aside for his devotions. I disagree with those who say that he brought an offering to his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Adam had the status of a high priest, and bringing him a gift was equivalent to bringing an offering to God (Krinsky).</i> There is support for the notion that Cain did not bring his offering from the first of the fruits of the ground in Scripture’s stating that <i>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not mention the same with regard to Cain. Cf. Rashi’s comment on this verse.</i>

Verse 4

AND THE LORD HAD RESPECT. <i>Va-yisha</i> (and he had respect) follows the paradigm of <i>va-yichar</i> (and he was wroth) in <i>And Cain was very wroth</i> (va-yichar).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">They are both shortened forms of the verb. The final <i>heh</i> of the root is dropped and the first root letter is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> because it precedes a root letter (Filwarg). See notes to 3:22.</i> <i>Va-yisha</i> means, and he accepted. <i>She’u</i> in <i>Look away</i> (she’u) <i>from me</i> (Is. 22:4) is close in meaning to it. They brought offerings in keeping with the secret meaning of the sacrificial ritual.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I.E.’s comment on Lev. 1:1. Weiser explains that I.E. believed that sacrifices were offered to gain some benefit. Cf. I.E. on Ex. 12:7.</i> It is possible that a fire came down from heaven and consumed Abel’s sacrifice but not Cain’s.I believe that <i>yamim</i> (time) (v. 3) means a full year. Scripture similarly states, <i>for a full year</i> (yamim) <i>shall he have the right of redemption</i> (Lev. 25:29). A year is called <i>yamim</i> (days) because it indicates that the full cycle of days, both long and short, has been completed. <i>From year to year</i> (mi-yamim yamimah) (Ex. 13:10) is similar. The meaning of <i>shenatayim yamim</i> (two full years) (Gen. 41:1) is two complete years from day to day. Had Scripture read <i>shenatayim</i> (two years), then it would possibly not have meant two full years from day to day.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It could have meant close to two years, two years being a round number.</i> Similarly <i>ad chodesh yamim</i> (but a whole month) (Num. 11:20) refers to a complete cycle of the moon. I therefore maintain that when the prophet Daniel prophesied <i>a thousand, two hundred and ninety days</i> (yamim) (Dan. 12:11), he meant days and not years. I say this because the days (<i>yamim</i>) are enumerated.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When the word <i>yamim</i> stands by itself, it means a complete year (all the days). When numbers are given it refers to days. Otherwise one could not know whether <i>sheloshah yamim</i> means three years or three days (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

SHALL IT NOT. Many commentators explain <i>se’et</i> (be lifted up) to mean thy sins will be forgiven.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Se’et</i> means forgiveness as in <i>noseh avon</i> (forgiving iniquity) (Ex. 34:7). Cf. Onkelos and Kimchi.</i> However, it appears to me that <i>se’et</i> means thy face will be lifted up. For it is previously written, <i>and his countenance fell</i> (v. 5). <i>And his countenance fell</i> indicates shame, as in <i>how then should I hold up my face</i> (esah panai) (II Sam. 2:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that one who is ashamed cannot hold his face up.</i> The meaning of our verse is: if you will do good, then you will lift up your face. <i>Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face</i> (tissa fanekha) <i>without spot</i> (Job 11:15) is similar.
SIN COUCHETH. Some say that <i>chattat</i> (sin) is used here in place of <i>avon</i> (iniquity).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture writes, <i>Sin coucheth</i> (chattat rovetz). The problem is that sin is a feminine noun and <i>rovetz</i> is a masculine verb. The phrase should read <i>chattat rovetzet</i>, hence the comment that <i>chattat</i> has been substituted for <i>avon</i>. They mean the same thing (Krinsky). The printed texts have <i>chet</i>. However, the Bible has <i>chattat, Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 has <i>chattat</i>, and we have followed suit.</i> There are also those who explain this clause to mean that thy iniquity (sin) will couch over thy grave at the day of judgment. They further explain the pronominal suffix of <i>teshukato</i> (its desire) as referring to Abel. Its meaning is, why are you wroth that I accepted Abel’s sacrifice since he is obligated to obey thee (<i>ve-elekha teshukato</i>), and thou art a ruler over him?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains <i>teshukah</i> as meaning obedience. See his comment on Gen. 3:16. Cain was a “ruler” over Abel because he was the older brother. One cannot explain <i>and unto thee is its desire</i> as referring to iniquity since iniquity is not a person.</i> Others say that the pronominal suffix of <i>teshukato</i> (its desire) refers to the impulse (<i>yetzer</i>) even though this impulse (<i>yetzer</i>) is not mentioned in this verse. These commentators explain <i>sin coucheth at the door</i> as meaning that your sin lies in wait at the door of your house and is always with you. Others interpret door (<i>petach</i>) as referring to the door of the mouth, as in <i>Keep the doors</i> (pitche) <i>of thy mouth</i> (Micah 7:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Man can sin even with his mouth (Filwarg).</i> However, in my opinion the word <i>chattat</i> (sin) in <i>sin coucheth at the door</i> is in the construct, and it is the impulse of man’s heart that “coucheth” with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chattat</i> is in the construct with <i>yetzer</i> (impulse). However, the word <i>yetzer</i> is not in the text and has to be supplied by the reader. In other words, <i>chattat</i> is short for <i>chattat ha-yetzer</i>. This eliminates the problem of a feminine noun (<i>chattat</i>) having a masculine verb (<i>rovetz</i>). The clause should thus be understood: the sin of the impulse of your heart coucheth at the door; that is, it is always with you.</i>
AND UNTO THEE IS ITS DESIRE. If you will it, then your impulse (<i>yetzer</i>) will obey you.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains <i>teshukah</i> (desire) as obedience (see note 14). Hence <i>its desire</i> means its obedience, the “it” referring to <i>yetzer</i> (impulse).</i> Additionally, you have the power to rule over it.

Verse 8

AND CAIN SPOKE. It appears to me that Cain related to Abel the full account of the rebuke with which God had reproached him. Those born on a dark day ask, how did Cain kill Abel since no swords were yet in existence? This is a foolish question. He could have choked him or killed him with a stone or a piece of wood inasmuch as there were thousands of stones and chunks of wood around.

Verse 9

[WHERE.] <i>Ay</i>(where) means the same as <i>ayeh</i>. The word <i>ayfo</i> (where) is a combination of two words.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Where (<i>ayeh</i>) and here (<i>poh</i>), i.e., in what place.</i>

Verse 10

CRIETH UNTO ME. <i>Crieth unto Me</i> is not connected to voice of (<i>kol</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It is connected to <i>thy brother’s blood</i>. <i>Kol</i> (voice) is singular, <i>tzo’akim</i> (crieth out) is a plural; thus <i>tzo’akim</i> cannot refer to <i>kol</i>. It is thus connected to <i>blood of</i>, which is a plural (Krinsky).</i> Similarly in <i>Hark, my beloved</i> (kol dodi)! <i>behold, he cometh</i>, (Cant. 2:8), <i>he cometh</i> is connected to <i>my beloved</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than to voice of (<i>kol</i>). <i>Cometh</i> is connected to <i>my beloved</i> because it is the beloved who leaps and skips, not the voice; the voice neither leaps nor skips (Krinsky). <i>Hinneh zeh ba</i> can be translated as, behold, he cometh, or behold it cometh.</i> as I have pointed out in my commentary on Canticles. The meaning of our verse is: I have heard the cry of your brother’s blood that was poured out upon the ground. However, Onkelos interprets <i>thy brother’s blood</i> as referring to the potential descendants of Abel.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the plural <i>deme</i> (blood of).

Cain was forced to wander far from the dwelling place of his father, Adam, who lived close to the Garden of Eden. He was never to find rest in one place but was constantly to be on the move.

Verse 12

[AND A WANDERER.] Some explain <i>nad</i> (wanderer) to mean a mourner, as in <i>to bemoan</i> (la-nud) <i>him</i> (Job 2:11). However, my opinion is that <i>nad</i> is a synonym for <i>na</i> (fugitive). <i>Nedod</i> (wander) in <i>Lo, then would I wander</i> (nedod) <i>far off</i> (Ps. 55:8) is analogous.

Verse 13

[MY PUNISHMENT<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>avoni</i> (my sin).</i> IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR.] All the commentaries explain this to mean that Cain confessed his sin. They say that the meaning of <i>neso</i> (bear) is forgiveness, as in <i>forgiving iniquity</i> (noseh avon) (Ex. 34:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">These commentators translate <i>avon</i> literally and render our clause as: my iniquity (<i>avon</i>) is beyond (<i>gadol</i>) forgiveness (<i>mi-neso</i>).</i> However, I disagree. In Hebrew reward is called <i>ekev</i> (heel), and the harsh punishment which comes as a result of iniquity is occasionally referred to as “sin.” Similarly we find, <i>for the iniquity</i> (avon) <i>of the Amorite is not yet full</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The time of their punishment has not arrived.</i> (Gen. 15:16); <i>there shall no punishment</i> (avon) <i>happen to thee</i> (I Sam. 28:10); <i>For the iniquity</i> (avon) <i>of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom</i> (Lamentations 4:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>avon</i> (iniquity) should be rendered punishment. The verse thus means: the punishment of my people is severer than the punishment of Sodom (Krinsky).</i> The meaning of our verse thus is: my punishment (<i>avon</i>) is greater than I can bear (<i>mi-neso</i>). The next verse substantiates this interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cain in verse 14 complains of his unfortunate plight. This shows that verse 13 is to be similarly interpreted.</i>
<i>Patzetah</i> (v.11) is to be rendered opened. <i>Yiftzeh</i> (doth open) in <i>But Job doth open</i> (yiftzeh) <i>his mouth in vanity</i> (Job 35:16) is similar.

Verse 14

[AND FROM THY FACE SHALL I BE HID.] All the world is full of God’s glory. Nevertheless, there are places more receptive to God’s power, and His might is seen there.

Verse 15

SEVENFOLD. Until seven generations, for <i>shivatayim</i> (sevenfold) does not mean fourteen,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Some render <i>shivatayim</i> as seven multiplied by two. They consider it a dual form like <i>shenatayim</i>, (two years) which is <i>shanah</i> (a year) multiplied by two.</i> nor does it mean three hundred and forty-three.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Some render <i>shivatayim</i> as seven multiplied by seven, multiplied by seven.</i> Proof that <i>shivatayim</i> means sevenfold is that the prophet states, <i>And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold</i> (shivatayim) and then explains his words, viz., <i>as the light of the seven days</i> (Is. 30:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>shivatayim</i> means seven days or seven times as much.</i>
[VENGEANCE SHALL BE TAKEN ON HIM.] The meaning of <i>yukkam</i> (vengeance shall be taken on him) is that vengeance shall be exacted from him. <i>He shall not be punished</i> (yukkam) (Ex. 21:21) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, vengeance shall not be taken on him.</i> The meaning of our verse is that God held back his anger and waited seven generations before punishing Cain.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is to be understood as follows: Cain shall be punished after seven generations.</i> Don’t ask, how could Cain’s life span extend for seven generations? Behold, his brother Seth lived many years with Noah.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Noah was the tenth generation from Adam. Thus Seth lived for more than seven generations.</i> It is also possible that Cain’s descendants are called Cain after their patriarch in the same way that Jews are called Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of the verse being: Cain’s descendants would bear his guilt.</i> Some say that the sign the Lord set for Cain was a horn. Others say God removed fear from Cain’s heart and gave him courage to face the world. It appears to me that God gave Cain a sign that no harm would befall him.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As he did to Gideon. Cf. Jud. 6.</i> Cain finally believed God because of the sign.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As Gideon did.</i> Scripture, however, does not tell us what the sign was.

Verse 16

IN THE LAND OF NOD. The land of Nod is so called because it was in that land that Cain was a wanderer and a fugitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 12.</i>
ON THE EAST SIDE OF EDEN. East of Eden and north of the garden.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra held that the inhabited world developed north of Eden. See Chap. II, note 37.</i> 

Verse 17

[ENOCH.] The city was called after Enoch, the son of Cain. Similarly the city of Samaria was called after Shemer (I Kings 16:24) and Egypt (<i>mitzraim</i>) was named for Mitzraim, son of Ham.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. 10:6. This is not explicitly stated in Scripture. I.E. assumes that it was so (Weiser).</i> 

Verse 18

Lamech was the seventh generation from Adam and the sixth from Cain.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it was from Lamech’s children that vengeance would be exacted for Abel’s murder.</i> 

Verse 19

[ADAH AND…ZILLAH.] Do not pay attention to Saadiah Gaon’s interpretation of Biblical names. Even if we knew Hebrew perfectly, how would we be able to ascertain the events which they commemorate? If the Bible did not state why Moses was named Moses, or Issaschar, Issaschar, would we be able to surmise the meaning of these names?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">A literal translation of a Biblical name does not reveal its meaning.</i>

Verse 20

[THE FATHER OF SUCH AS DWELL IN TENTS.] The meaning of <i>avi</i> (father of) is first. The same is true of the word <i>av</i> (father)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The father (<i>av</i>) is first, i.e., is born before his son.</i> and the word (<i>aviv</i>) (spring).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The first fruits appear in <i>aviv</i> (spring).</i> When the word for father is in the construct it always has a <i>yod</i> suffixed to it. The same is true with the word for brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Singulars in the construct usually do not have a <i>yod</i> suffixed to them, hence I.E.’s comment that father of is <i>avi</i>, brother of is <i>achi</i>.</i>

Verse 21

THE HARP AND PIPE. Harp and pipe (<i>kinnor ve-ugav</i>) are types of musical instruments. The ability to play these instruments requires great wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The ancients considered music not only a skill but a wisdom, or what we would call an art.</i>

Verse 22

THE FORGER. <i>Lotesh</i> (the forger) means the sharpener. <i>Li-litosh</i> in <i>to sharpen</i> (li-litosh) <i>every man his plowshare</i> (I Sam. 13:20) is similar.

Verse 23

[AND LAMECH SAID…] Note, this <sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 23 and 24. The reason is that I.E. understands verses 23 and 24 to be an attempt by Lamech to induce his wives to cohabit with him. However, verses 20 through 22 tell us that they in fact did so. Hence verses 23 and 24 must describe what happened before verses 20-22. Its meaning is that Lamech had already said to Adah and Zillah. <i>Va-yomer</i> is thus a pluperfect (Krinsky).</i> should have appeared earlier. I have already noted two similar examples of this in my earlier comments.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 1:9.</i> Three additional examples are: <i>that the man took a golden ring</i> (Gen. 24:22);<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This is followed by: <i>and said: Whose daughter art thou</i> (Gen. 24:23). Now, would the servant give a golden ring to the girl before asking her who she was? Therefore Gen. 24:23 must be rendered: And he already said, Whose daughter art thou (Krinsky).</i> <i>And the Lord said unto Moses, say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiff-necked people</i> (Ex. 33:5);<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This is preceded by: <i>And when the people heard these evil tidings</i> (v. 4). However, the evil tidings are reported in verse 5. Thus verse 5 should precede verse 4. Hence the meaning of <i>And when the people heard</i> (v. 4) is: and when the people had heard; i.e., when they heard the following, namely what is reported in the next verse (Meijler).</i> and <i>And I besought the Lord at that time</i> (Deut. 3:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I.E.’s comment on Deut. 3:23. What is reported in this verse took place before Deut. 3:21, viz., <i>And I commanded Joshua</i>, etc. Moses besought God before he commanded Joshua not to fear the kings of Canaan. Hence Deut. 3:23 is to be rendered as <i>And I had besought the Lord</i>. Ibid. I. E.’s commentary.</i> As to our verse, it is to be interpreted as our sages did. The rabbis tell us that Adah and Zillah were afraid to bear children because they feared that their offspring, who were the seventh generation from Cain, would die or be killed as punishment for Cain’s sin. Therefore Lamech said to them, “I am in truth the seventh generation<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">From Cain. However, in truth Lamech lied to them. He was the sixth and not the seventh generation from Cain (Filwarg).</i> and if a man would wound me or a child bruise me, then I would kill them.” <i>I have slain</i> is used in place of <i>I will slay</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Haragti</i> is a perfect.</i> Similar examples are: <i>I will give</i> (natati)<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, I gave.</i> <i>the price of the field</i> (Gen. 23:13), and <i>which I took out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., I took (<i>lakachti</i>) means I will take.</i> <i>of the hand of the Amorite</i> (Gen. 48:22). There are many similar instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the Bible occasionally uses a perfect in place of an imperfect.</i> 
Lamech said to his wives, <i>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold</i> because Cain deliberately murdered and he, Lamech, did not.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">If Cain, who committed willful murder, had his punishment deferred for seven generations, I who did not kill anyone shall not be punished for a very long time (Krinsky). Hence you have nothing to fear from having children with me.</i> In other words, Lamech told his wives that the decree upon Cain was annulled. However, the fact of the matter is that Lamech’s children and all his seed perished in the deluge. Thus Cain’s name was wiped out because he murdered his brother.

[BEGAN TO CALL.] <i>Huchal</i> (began) belongs to those verbs whose second and third root letters are identical.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>chet, lamed, lamed</i>.</i> If the <i>chet</i> were not a guttural, it would receive a <i>dagesh</i>. <i>Huchal</i> comes from the same root as <i>techil’ah</i> (first). The meaning of the clause <i>then began</i> (huchal) <i>men to call upon the name of the Lord</i> is: then men first started praying. If <i>huchal</i> were derived from <i>chillul</i> (profane),<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi: “<i>Huchal</i> is an expression of profaneness.”</i> then <i>the name of the Lord</i> would follow profane.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>huchal</i> means to profane, the verse reads as follows: then was it profaned to call the name of God. An impossible sentence. If <i>huchal</i> means profaned, the verse should read: then was God’s name profaned.</i>

Verse 1

THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM. The children and grandchildren that he begot.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Toledot</i> (generations) comes from the root <i>yod, lamed, dalet</i>.

Scripture notes that Adam <i>begat a son in his own likeness, after his image</i> (v. 3)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">All living creatures produce offspring that resemble them.

The Bible notes that Adam, like God, was able to produce children in the image of God.</i> Scripture does not say the same with regard to Cain and Abel, nor does it state how long Cain lived or how old Cain was when he begot his son Enoch. It omits the above clause because the former was murdered and the latter’s descendants perished in the deluge.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The lines of both Cain and Abel were wiped out. But the Bible notes these things with regard to Seth because Noah was descended from him.</i> The Torah tells the story of the murderer Cain to stress God’s righteousness. God was long-suffering with Cain but he ultimately punished him. This is in keeping with <i>and that (God) will by no means clear the guilty</i> (Ex. 34:7).

Verse 24

AND HE WAS NOT; FOR GOD TOOK HIM. That is, he died. So, too, <i>take, I beseech Thee, my life from me</i> (Jonah 4:3). Scripture similarly states, <i>I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes</i> (Ezek. 24:16) and then explains its meaning, namely, his wife died (Ezek. 24:18). The Bible does not state with regard to Enoch’s being taken that Enoch died, nor is there any reference to a plague causing his death. The meaning of <i>took him</i> in our verse is similar to <i>take me</i> in the psalm of Asaph, <i>And afterward take me with glory</i> (Ps. 73:24), and <i>He shall take me</i>, in the psalm of the sons of Korach, <i>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the netherworld; For He shall take me</i> (Ps. 49:16).

Verse 29

[THIS SAME SHALL COMFORT US.] Lamech was informed by Adam, who was a prophet, that through his newborn child the land would live. Or perhaps they learned the aforementioned through astrology. And so it was, for it was through Noah that the world was preserved. Furthermore, Noah was, as the Bible explicitly states, an expert in agriculture (Gen. 9:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is I.E.’s explanation of <i>ish ha’adamah</i> (a husbandman). Cf. his comments on Gen. 9:20. Krinsky explains that Noah introduced agricultural implements and other advances in working the soil. This is an additional example of Noah giving “life” to the land</i> It is also possible that he got this name after<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He originally had another name.</i> his agricultural successes. We find the same with Jerubbaal.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">His original name was Gideon but he was subsequently called Jerubbaal after breaking the alter of Baal (Jud. 6:32).</i> Noah (rest) is the opposite of toil (<i>etzavon</i>). The meaning of our verse is, this one will comfort us and we will rest (<i>nanu’ach</i>) from the toil of our hands. Moreover, comfort is a relaxation of the heart’s pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible tells us that Noah was so called because Lamech said, <i>This one should comfort us</i>. However, if this was the case he should have named his son Menachem or Nahum which comes from the root <i>nun, chet, mem</i>, meaning to comfort. Noah comes from the root <i>nun, vav, chet</i>, meaning rest, hence I.E.’s comment that he was called Noah because comfort and rest are related.</i> The Hebrews are more concerned with the idea expressed by a word than with its etymology. Proof of the above is the fact that Jerubbaal is referred to as Jerubbesheth.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gideon was called Jerubbaal, meaning “Let Baal contend against him” (Jud. 6:32). In II Sam. 11:21 he is called Jerubbesheth. <i>Boshet</i> is Hebrew for shame. This was an undignified way of referring to Baal. Nevertheless, Jerubbaal and Jerubbesheth express the same idea. In the same way Noah expresses the same idea as Menachem.</i> Those who ask whom Cain and Seth married raise a worthless question. Scripture tells us that Adam begot sons and daughters. The same is true of all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The antediluvian patriarchs prior to Lamech all married their sisters.</i>

Verse 1

[BEGAN.] <i>Hechel</i> (began) is a <i>hifil</i>. It is a denominative of <i>techillah</i> (beginning).

THE SONS OF GOD. The term <i>bene Elohim</i> (the sons of god) refers to the sons of the judges who dispensed God’s (<i>Elohim</i>) justice.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 1:1.</i> Others say that <i>Elohim</i> refers to God Himself and the sons of God are holy ones (saints) living on earth. They are called <i>sons of God</i> in the sense of <i>Ye are the children of the Lord your God</i> (Deut. 14:1). Others say that <i>the sons of God</i> refers to the children of Seth<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning whom it is written that he was created in God’s image.

See previous note.</i> However, it appears to me that <i>the sons of God</i> refers to those who know the will of the most High. These men chose women who matched them astrologically and physically. Hence they produced mighty men. It is possible that they took women even against their will.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And they took them wives</i> implies they took women against their will. If, according to astrology, a given women was fit for a man, he took her even against her will (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 3

MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT ABIDE. Some say that <i>yadon</i> (shall abide) is like the word <i>nedanah</i> (sheath thereof), as in <i>and he put up his sword back into the sheath thereof</i> (nedanah) (I Chron. 21:27), for the body serves as a sheath for the spirit.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of the phrase is: my spirit will not forever be in its sheath (the human body); i.e., man will die (Kimchi).</i> Proof of this is found in <i>my spirit was pained in the midst of my body</i> (nidneh) (Dan. 7:15). Nevertheless, <i>nadan</i> and <i>yadon</i> come from different roots.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yadon</i> (shall abide) comes from the root <i>dalet, vav, nun</i>. <i>Nadan</i> comes from the root <i>nun, dalet, nun</i>.</i> We find the same with the words <i>nasah</i> (lifted) and <i>si’o</i> (his excellency). We read, <i>Though his excellency</i> (si’o) <i>mount up to the heavens</i> (Job 20:6). The root of <i>si’o</i> is <i>sin, vav, alef</i>. Nevertheless, a word derived from <i>nasah</i> (lifted) (whose root is <i>nun, sin, alef</i>) would have a similar meaning. There are many examples of this. Others say that <i>yadon</i> follows the paradigm of <i>ve-yashov</i> (returneth), as in <i>And the dust returneth</i> (ve-yashov) <i>to the earth as it was</i> (Eccles. 12:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>ayin, vav</i> is usually vocalized with a <i>shuruk</i>, as in <i>yakum</i> (he will arise). <i>Yadon</i> is vocalized with a <i>cholam</i>. I.E. points out that the same is true with <i>returneth</i>. It, too, is vocalized <i>ve-yashov</i>, rather than <i>ve-yashuv</i>. <i>Ve-yashov</i> comes from the root <i>shin, vav, bet</i>. It, too, is an <i>ayin, vav</i>.</i> They say that <i>yadon</i> comes from the same root as <i>din</i> (to judge) because the spirit judges the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Man’s spirit (<i>ru’ach</i>) ultimately determines how man will act. God said that this “judge” will not remain united with the body; i.e., man would die. Krinsky explains it differently. He says the meaning of the verse is: my spirit (the spirit which I placed in man) will not judge man; i.e., man follows his evil inclinations. He acts without discernment. He follows the way of the flesh rather than that of the spirit. It appears that he will continually do so, therefore… Cherez explains, God’s spirit judges man. The meaning of the verse is: my spirit will not judge men forever; i.e., I have decided on their punishment.</i>
FOR THAT HE IS ALSO. In the word <i>be-shaggam</i> (for that also) the <i>shin</i> placed before <i>gam</i> (also) has the same meaning as the <i>shin</i> placed before <i>kakhah</i> (thus).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It means that. The <i>shin</i> of <i>be-shaggam</i> is a particle of relation, short for <i>asher</i>. In other words, there is no such word as <i>shaggam</i>. I.E. makes this point because the <i>shin</i> which means <i>that</i> is usually vocalized with a <i>segol</i>, while the <i>shin</i> of <i>shaggam</i> is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>.</i> The term <i>My spirit refers to God’s spirit, for man’s spirit comes from God</i>. Similarly, <i>And the spirit returneth unto God who gave it</i> (Eccles. 12:7). The spirit spoken of by Ecclesiastes refers only to the spirit in man. The meaning of the verse is: My spirit shall not abide in man because of his violent ways and because he is (<i>be-shaggem</i>) made of flesh, grows until he achieves maturity, and then due to his sexual activity begins his decline.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Krinsky and Weiser. This is the second time I.E. has noted that the man begins his decline with sexual maturity (cf. Gen. 3:8). Perhaps I.E. held to the medieval belief that emission of semen weakens the body.</i>
THEREFORE SHALL HIS DAYS BE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS. Some explain that this refers to man’s life span.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Henceforth man’s life span will be limited to 120 years.</i> If we find some living longer than this,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Chap. 11 lists the descendants of Noah. All of them lived more than 120 years and were born subsequent to this decree (Cherez).</i> they are but a few. Our verse speaks of most people. However, this interpretation is not correct. Behold, Shem lived for six hundred years. Also, the generations that followed him lived many, many years beyond a hundred and twenty. It was only in the days of Peleg (Gen. 10:25) that the life span was shortened. From the days of King David onward it has been limited to seventy or eighty years. The correct meaning of <i>therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years</i> is as Onkelos explained, namely, that God set a time for mankind to repent. We see the same idea in <i>Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown</i> (Jonah 3:4). God gave them one hundred and twenty years in which to repent and save themselves, or to remain unrepentant and perish. Scripture’s statement, <i>And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham and Japheth</i> (Gen. 5:32), should not disturb you,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 5:32 tells us that Noah was 500 years old when he had his children. Gen. 6:3 tells us, according to I.E., that man has 120 years in which to repent. Gen. 7:6 tells us that the flood came in the 600th year of Noah’s life. Thus between the statement in Gen. 6:3 and the flood there is at the very most 100 years (cf. Rashi), hence I.E.’s interpretation that Gen. 6:3 occurred before Gen. 5:32.</i> because the Bible is not in chronological sequence.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Gen. 6:3 deals with events that came before those dealt with in Gen. 5:32.</i> Note, the Torah states, <i>and Terah died in Haran</i> (Gen. 11:32), then goes on to say, <i>Now the Lord said unto Abram: Get thee out of thy country</i> (Gen. 12:1). However, we know that Terah did not die until Isaac was thirty-five years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Many years after Abraham left his country. Terah, who lived to be 205 years, was 70 when Abraham was born (Gen. 11:26). Abraham was a hundred when Isaac was born (Gen. 21:5). Thus Terah was 170 when Isaac was born, and 205 when Isaac was 35.</i> There are many other similar instances in Scripture.

Verse 4

[THE NEPHILIM.] They were so named because anyone who saw them lost heart at their huge stature.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, feh, lamed</i>, meaning to fall.</i>

Verse 6

AND IT REPENTED THE LORD. The Torah spoke in the language of men,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>And it repented</i> is an anthropomorphism.</i> for we know that God is not a man that he should repent.

[AND IT GRIEVED HIM AT HIS HEART.] This verse is the opposite of <i>Let the Lord rejoice in His works</i> (Ps. 104:31).

Verse 7

AND THE LORD SAID. In His heart, or to the angels; others say, to Noah. However, it appears to me that <i>And the Lord said</i> is connected to <i>His heart</i> of the previous verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. argues that the meaning of <i>And the Lord said</i> is the Lord said in his heart.

Verse 8

GRACE. <i>Chen</i> (grace) means mercy. From it we get the word <i>techinnah</i> (supplication).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The supplicant seeks mercy. Also, the word <i>techinnah</i> is used in the sense of mercy in Ezra 9:8.

Both <i>ketz</i> and <i>chen</i> drop the final letter of the root.</i> The meaning of <i>found grace (mercy or pity) in the eyes of the Lord</i> is like <i>No eye pitied thee</i> (Ezek. 16:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Finding grace in God’s eyes means that God took pity on a person (Filwarg).

Verse 9

THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS. <i>Toledot</i> (generations) means the events that transpired during his lifetime, as in <i>what a day may bring forth</i> (yeled) (Prov. 27:1). <i>These are the generations of Jacob</i> (Gen. 37:2) is similar.
A MAN RIGHTEOUS. In his deeds.
AND WHOLE-HEARTED. In his heart. <i>Tamim</i> (wholehearted) is an adjective. It belongs to those roots whose second and third letters are the same. All three letters of the root remain in this word.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The root of wholehearted is <i>taf, mem, mem</i>. This root gives birth both to <i>tam</i> (wholehearted) and <i>tamim</i> (wholehearted). In the former, a <i>mem</i> is dropped. In the latter, the whole root is found in the word. I.E. employs a pun. He says <i>tamim</i> is <i>tamim</i>. According to I.E. <i>tamim</i> is an adjective modifying man (Filwarg, Krinsky and Cherez).</i>
[IN HIS GENERATIONS.] At the time of the flood, and in the generations after the flood.

Verse 11

AND THE EARTH WAS CORRUPT. The people of the earth were corrupt. Similarly, <i>when a land sinneth against Me</i> (Ezek. 14:13), and <i>And all countries came into Egypt</i> (Gen. 41:57).
[BEFORE GOD.] Some say this means they sinned in public. Others say it means people were privately corrupt with regard to secret affairs so that only God was aware of their sins. In my opinion, the Torah speaks the language of men so that people will understand what is being said. The meaning of <i>before God</i> is that they acted like a servant, who in the presence of his master, disobeys him and thereby shows that he does not fear him. Those who say that <i>Elohim</i> (God) does not refer to the Almighty are speaking nonsense.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">They say that Elohim refers to judges.</i>
VIOLENCE. Theft, oppression and taking women against their will. 

Verse 12

Our sages are correct in interpreting <i>for all flesh had corrupted their way</i> to mean that all flesh engaged in unnatural and perverted sexual acts. Indeed, how precious is their interpretation to the effect that they corrupted with water<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to semen.

Verse 13

AND GOD SAID UNTO NOAH: THE END OF ALL FLESH. All bodies.
[IS COME BEFORE ME.] The time of their calamity has arrived.
WITH THE EARTH. <i>Et ha’aretz</i> (with the earth) means from the earth. Similarly, <i>As soon as I am gone out of the city</i> (et ha’ir) (Ex. 9:29). It may also be rendered, with the earth, as in <i>with Jacob</i> (et Yaakov) <i>every man came with his household</i> (Ex. 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Et</i> is usually the sign of the accusative. Thus this clause should be rendered: I will destroy them, the earth. This translation is impossible, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It appears to me that <i>mashchitam</i> (I will destroy them) stands for two words. Similarly, the word <i>God</i> in <i>O God of hosts</i> (Ps. 80:8) and <i>thy throne</i> in <i>thy throne God</i> (Ps. 45:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Gen. 2:19, <i>mosekh atzmo</i>, etc. Ps. 80:8 reads, <i>Elohim Tzeva’ot</i> (literally, God hosts). It should read, <i>Elohe Tzeva’ot</i> (God of hosts). Hence <i>Elohim</i> is to be read as if written twice, <i>Elohim Elohe Tzeva’ot</i> (God, God of hosts). Similarly <i>kisakha Elohim</i> (Ps. 45:7) is ungrammatical. It must be read, <i>kisakhakha kisse Elohim</i> (Thy throne, God’s throne).</i> The meaning of our verse is: And, behold, I will destroy them and destroy the earth.

GOPHER. Gopher is the name of a wood that rides lightly upon the water. It is mentioned nowhere else in Scripture.
ROOMS. So that each animal, cattle and fowl would be alone with its mate.
[ARK.] The Bible uses the term ark and not ship, for it did not have the shape of a ship nor did it have oars.

Some say that <i>ve-khafarta</i> (and shalt pitch) comes from the same root as <i>kapporet</i> (cover) (Ex. 25:17), the meaning of <i>and shalt pitch it</i> being you shall cover it by coating it. [PITCH.] Some say that <i>kofer</i> is a pitch-like substance. Others say that a certain clay with pitch-like qualities is found in the ground and is to be identified with the <i>kofer</i> in our verse. Others identify it with a substance similarly called in Arabic while noting that in Arabic it is spelled with a <i>kof</i> rather than a <i>caf</i>. In reality, <i>ve-khafarta</i> (and shalt pitch) is a denominative of <i>kofer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew has many such verbs.

Verse 20

[SHALL COME UNTO THEE.] They will come by themselves. Noah therefore did not have to search for them on islands; neither did he have to hunt for all sorts of fowl. God commanded Noah to prepare food for all the animals in the ark. Foolish ones ask, what did birds of prey eat? What did carnivorous animals such as lions who live on meat eat?

The Bible does not mention the streams because their waters come from the fountains. When the fountains of the deep broke up, their waters gushed upward and the windows of the heavenly storehouse of water were opened and their contents poured down upon the earth. The earth was confounded; there was no way of telling day from night. Proof of the latter is God’s promise to Noah after the flood that <i>and day and night shall not cease</i> (Gen. 8:22).

Verse 16

AND THEY THAT WENT IN, WENT IN MALE AND FEMALE. The meaning of <i>And they that went in</i> is: and they that went into the ark.
[AND THE LORD SHUT HIM IN.] The term <i>shut him in</i> in our verse has a positive connotation. It has to be so interpreted because being shut in at that time was preferable to not being shut in. However, elsewhere it has a negative implication. Thus we read, <i>He shutteth up a man</i> (Job 12:14), and <i>And whom God hath hedged in</i> (Job 3:23). That it has a negative connotation is obvious from the first half of the verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Job 3:23 opens with <i>To a man whose way is hid</i>; similarly Job 12:14 opens with <i>Behold, He breaketh down</i>.</i> Noah closed the door of the ark and God helped him in that no part of the ark cracked open, for had any part opened, then all would have immediately died. Why state, <i>and the flood was forty days upon the earth</i> (v. 17), after having said, <i>And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights</i> (v. 12)? The way to read the verse (v. 17) is as follows: After the flood was forty days upon the earth, <i>the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 17 does not intend to teach us that there was a flood upon the earth; verse 12 does that.

Verse 19

EXCEEDINGLY. The word <i>me’od</i> (exceedingly) is repeated in the text in order to stress that the waters prevailed to their maximum potential. Why state, <i>and the mountains were covered</i> (v. 20), after having said, <i>and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered</i> (v. 19)? Its meaning is: All the high mountains were covered with water (v. 19), and these mountains were covered by fifteen cubits of water (v. 20).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20 should be understood as follows: 15 cubits did the waters prevail, so that the mountains (mentioned in v. 19) were covered (by 15 cubits of water).</i> There are those who maintain that there is a very tall mountain in Greece that the waters did not cover.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Krinsky.</i> However, we believe the words of our God and we put aside the foolish nonsense of man.

Verse 21

[AND ALL FLESH PERISHED.] The meaning of <i>And all flesh perished</i> is: and all flesh had perished.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Perished is a pluperfect. All flesh obviously perished before the mountains were covered by 15 cubits of water.</i> There are many such instances in Scripture, such as <i>And I besought the Lord</i> (Deut. 3:23), and the true meaning of <i>And He caused manna to rain upon them for food</i> (Ps. 78:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>va-yamter</i> (and he caused to rain) does not appear to be a pluperfect, it is, (and he had caused to rain).

[PERISHED.] <i>Va-yigva</i> (perished) means died. I will explain the exact meaning of this term when I comment on <i>And Abraham expired</i> (va-yigva), <i>and died</i> (Gen. 25:8). It is clear<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">From verse 21. I.E.’s point is that <i>ha-romes</i> is a general term. The verse then goes on to enumerate exactly what <i>ha-romes</i> includes.</i> that <i>remes</i> (creeping thing) is a general term that includes fowl, cattle, animals, small thin swarming things and man. It is possible that <i>all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life</i> (v. 22) refers to <i>every man</i> (v. 21),<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22 thus explains only <i>every man</i>, i.e., those who had a <i>neshamat ru’ach chayyim</i>.

Many say that the soul is termed <i>neshamah</i> because it comes from the heaven (<i>shamayim</i>).

Verse 23

AND THEY WERE BLOTTED OUT. Their names were erased from the earth because they left no descendants. [AND NOAH ONLY WAS LEFT.] Only Noah and those with him were left. This verse proves how wrong are some of our ignorant brethren who maintain that the flood did not cover the entire earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Some say this alludes to those who maintain that a certain high mountain in Greece was not covered by the flood; others, to the Rabbinic sages who said that the land of Israel was not covered by the flood.

Others say that I.E. directed his barb against those who take the Rabbinic statement literally.</i>

Verse 24

AND THE WATERS PREVAILED UPON THE EARTH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS. This was so because the fountains were broken up (v. 11) and it rained for a day and stopped for a day for, <i>and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights</i> (v. 4) means it will rain for a period of forty days and forty nights without letup. That it did in fact also rain after the first forty days were over is evident from <i>and the rain from heaven was restrained</i> (Gen. 8:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The rain was now fully restrained, which implies that prior to this it was only partially restrained.</i>

AND THE WATERS ASSUAGED. They rested and no longer prevailed. <i>Then was the king’s wrath assuaged</i> (Esther 7:10) is similar. Assuaged in our verse and in Esther is in the <i>kal</i>. However, in our verse the <i>caf</i> receives a <i>dagesh</i> to make up for the missing middle root letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>shin, caf, caf</i>.

Verse 2

They include 13 days in Cheshvan, 30 days in Kislev, 29 days in Tevet, 30 in Shevat, 29 in Adar and 17 in Nisan: a total of 148 days (Krinsky).</i> Why go to all this trouble? Even if the Bible explicitly stated that Noah employed solar months or that he counted the months from Tishri<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Making Chesvan the second month as the previously quoted second opinion held.</i> this would have no effect on Jewish law, for the laws governing the establishment of the seasons were not given by Noah.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">But by Moses.

Verse 4



Verse 5

IN THE TENTH MONTH, ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH, WERE THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS SEEN.

From that day on the raven continuously went to and fro until Noah left the ark, for Scripture states that <i>it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth</i>. On the day that the earth dried, Noah and all that were with him left the ark. Seven days after sending the raven, Noah sent the dove. The latter event took place on the seventeenth day of Shevat, which was the tenth month from the start of the flood. Noah observed the quarterly watch.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The month is divided into quarters (watches).

Verse 11

IN HER MOUTH AN OLIVE-LEAF FRESHLY PLUCKED. Some say that Scripture employs two words with one meaning,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aleh</i> (leaf) and <i>taraf</i> (freshly plucked) mean the same.

Similarly in Daniel <i>adamah</i> (earth) and <i>afar</i> (dust) mean the same and the Bible could have employed only one word.</i> as it does in <i>the dust of the earth</i> (Dan. 12:2). They interpret <i>taraf</i> (freshly plucked) as leaf. <i>All its sprouting leaves</i> (tarpe tzimchah) (Ezek. 17:9) is similar. That <i>taraf</i> is a noun is evident from the long <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>resh</i>. It is like <i>zahav</i> (gold) and <i>ashan</i> (smoke). However, in my opinion the <i>bet</i> of <i>be-fihah</i> (mouth) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. says that the phrase should read <i>taraf-pihah</i> (its mouth had plucked).

It is also possible that <i>taraf</i> (freshly plucked) is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> because it is an adjective like <i>chacham</i> (wise).

Verse 13

THE WATERS WERE DRIED UP FROM OFF THE EARTH. Only the surface of the earth dried; the soil itself was swampy and hence not yet firm enough to walk upon. The earth did not fully dry until later.

In the first instance Cheshvan and Kislev have 29 days each; in the second Cheshvan has 29 days and Kislev 30; in the third both Cheshvan and Kislev have 30 days each.

SMELLED. <i>Va-yarach</i> (smelled) follows the paradigm of <i>va-yanach</i> (rested) in <i>and rested</i> (va-yanach) <i>in all the borders of Egypt</i> (Ex. 10:14).

According to this interpretation we do not have to add the word “because” before <i>into your hand are they delivered</i>. However, it should be noted that this comment is difficult. <i>U-ve-khol</i> has a <i>vav</i>. Weiser suggests interpreting I.E.: and the <i>bet</i> of <i>u-ve-khol</i> is superfluous. Cf.

The same is true for <i>u-ve-khol</i> (Weiser). According to this explanation the second half of the verse is a continuation of the first half. The entire verse should be read as follows: And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth… and upon all (<i>be-khol</i>) wherewith the ground teemeth, and upon all (<i>u-ve-khol</i>) the fish of the sea; because into your hand are they delivered. According to this interpretation “because” has to be added to the text (Cherez).</i>

Verse 3

EVERY MOVING THING. <i>Remes</i> (moving thing) is a general term for wild and domesticated animals and for all fowl and fish. Man was now permitted to kill and eat them all.

Verse 4

ONLY FLESH WITH THE LIFE THEREOF, WHICH IS THE BLOOD THEREOF, SHALL YE NOT EAT. The meaning of this verse is that you shall not eat flesh with its life (<i>nefesh</i>), which is its blood, as in <i>and thou shalt not eat the life</i> (nefesh, i.e., the blood) <i>with the flesh</i> (Deut. 12:23), and <i>For as to the life</i> (nefesh) <i>of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life</i> (nefesh) <i>thereof</i> (Lev. 17:14). The <i>nefesh</i> (life) which moves and feels is the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>nefesh</i> does not here refer to soul; it means body. However, by extension it also refers to the blood which gives life to the body. Krinsky has an alternate reading: the <i>nefesh</i> spoken of here refers to that which moves and feels within the body, i.e., the blood. According to Cherez, I.E. uses the term body for the blood.</i>

Verse 5

AND SURELY YOUR BLOOD OF YOUR LIVES WILL I REQUIRE. I have permitted you to shed the blood of all living creatures. However, I have prohibited you the spilling of the blood of your lives because you are human. On the contrary, I will avenge that blood (<i>edreshennu</i>), as in <i>For He that avengeth</i> (doresh) <i>blood</i> (Ps. 9:13). Scripture first lays down a general rule, <i>And surely your blood of your lives will I require</i>, and then goes into detail and tells us whom God will punish for taking human life. AND AT THE HAND OF MAN. If many people kill one person or if one man kills another person (even at the hand of every man’s brother), I will avenge that death. I will also punish a beast that kills a man by having another animal kill it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This explains, <i>at the hand of every beast will I require it</i>.</i> Thus man is permitted to kill animals but animals are prohibited from killing humans. In my opinion it is farfetched to maintain that <i>and surely your blood of your lives</i> refers to suicide.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Baba Kama</i> 91b. This verse teaches that a person is prohibited from harming himself. See also Rabbi B. Epstein, <i>Torah Temimah</i> on this verse.</i> 

Verse 6

[WHOSO SHEDDETH MAN’S BLOOD, BY MAN SHALL HIS BLOOD BE SHED.] This is a further elaboration.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">On <i>at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man</i>. God will see to it that the murderers will somehow be killed by another person (Filwarg).</i> It may also be taken, and this appears most likely, as a command to the sons of Noah to execute murderers. The term <i>ba-adam</i> (by man) can be interpreted in one of three ways: in front of witnesses;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bet</i> meaning in front of; <i>ba-adam</i>, in front of people, i.e. witnesses or in public.

Verse 8

AND GOD SPOKE UNTO NOAH, AND TO HIS SONS. God spoke to Noah’s sons through Noah. It is also possible that they were all prophets and God addressed all four of them.

Verse 9

AND WITH YOUR SEED. <i>Ve-et zarakhem</i> is to be rendered: and with your seed.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>et</i> here has the meaning of <i>im</i> (with).</i> The third <i>with you</i> (v. 10) is to be interpreted as meaning: that were <i>with you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ittekhem</i> (with your) appears three times in verses 9 and 10. The third <i>with you</i>, i.e., <i>and every beast of the earth with you</i>, appears redundant because it follows <i>and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle</i>. Hence I.E. interprets the former to mean that were with you in the Ark.</i> It is also possible that <i>with you</i> is repeated for additional explanation.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible repeats itself in order to further explain itself; i.e., the beasts spoken of are those that are with you.</i> The covenant spoken of is that all flesh not be cut off anymore by the waters of the flood (v. 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11 reads, <i>And I will establish My covenant with you; neither shall</i>, etc. Hence it appears that a covenant was made and then God promised <i>neither shall</i>, etc. I.E. points out that <i>neither shall</i> opens the covenant (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11

[NEITHER SHALL ALL FLESH BE CUT OFF.] Flesh refers to the body. The body is so designated because flesh senses and the bones do not. The covenant is a promise that all bodies will never again be destroyed by a flood. God included in His covenant a pledge not to bring a comparable deluge ever again because the first part of His promise, <i>neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood</i>, may be taken to imply that there will be other floods but that God will save humanity. It is concerning this covenant that the prophet says, <i>For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah Should no more go over the earth</i> (Is. 54:9).

Verse 12

THE TOKEN. <i>Ot</i> (token) may be either masculine or feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Here it is feminine. In Ex. 3:12 it is masculine.</i>

Verse 14

WHEN I BRING CLOUDS OVER THE EARTH. The <i>nun</i> of <i>be-aneni</i> (when I bring clouds) does not have a <i>dagesh</i> even though it is a <i>pi’el</i> and therefore should have a <i>dagesh</i> in the middle radical of the root, as in <i>when I speak</i> (be-dabberi) <i>with thee</i> (Ex. 19:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bet</i> of <i>dabberi</i> has a <i>dagesh</i>. I.E. reads, <i>be-dabberi ittakh</i>. However, Ex. 19:9 <i>reads, be-dabberi immakh</i>. According to <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 the reference is to Ezek. 3:27. However, here, too, the quote is not exact. If not a scribal error, it shows that I.E. quoted verses from memory.</i>
AND THE BOW IS SEEN IN THE CLOUDS. If we would believe what the Greek scholars tell us, that the rainbow is produced by the sun’s flames, then we must assume that after the flood God strengthened the sun’s light.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the rainbow was created after the flood. Hence he believes that God now strengthened the sun’s power so that its rays would produce a rainbow.</i> This is the way that a person who understands the sciences will interpret this verse.

Verse 15

[AND THE WATERS SHALL NO MORE BECOME.] The use of the singular <i>yiheyeh</i> (shall become) with <i>mayim</i> (waters) does not prove that <i>mayim</i> is singular.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 1:14.</i> We find the same word used with a plural in <i>But there were</i> (va-yehi)<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yehi</i> is singular.</i> <i>certain men</i> (Num. 9:6).

Verse 16

[AND THE BOW SHALL BE IN THE CLOUD.] The bow is always hidden in the cloud and there seen by God.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Even when man does not see the bow, God sees it and remembers his covenant. When man does not see the bow it is hidden in the clouds.</i>

Verse 17

This is <i>the covenant</i> that I disclosed to you and this is the oath <i>which I have established</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>which I have established</i> does not refer to sign because a sign is not established.

Abraham thus commanded his servant, <i>thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites</i> (Gen. 24:3). Rebecca similarly said, <i>If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth…what good shall my life do me</i> (Gen. 27:46).

Verse 21

AND HE WAS UNCOVERED. <i>Va-yitgal</i> (and he was uncovered) comes from the root <i>gimel, lamed, heh</i>, meaning to uncover. It is a <i>hitpa’el.

BACKWARD. Opposite of the normal way of walking, which is to go forward.

Verse 24

AND NOAH AWOKE. Scripture does not reveal what was done to Noah. Be that as it may, Canaan was the culprit. The sequence of events was as follows: Ham saw his father’s nakedness and unlike his brothers did not cover him. On the contrary, he revealed what he saw. Canaan heard that Noah was lying naked in his tent and did something to Noah. However, the Bible does not tell us what he did to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The sages of the Talmud are divided as to what was done to Noah. Some say that he was castrated. Others say that he was sodomized. Cf. <i>San</i>. 70a.</i> 
The meaning of the verse <i>and (Noah) knew what his youngest son had done unto him</i> is proof<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Ham was not Noah’s youngest son; therefore <i>his youngest son</i> cannot refer to him.

The one who says that Ham was the culprit, and that Canaan was cursed because Noah did not want to curse his son (Ham) because God had blessed Noah’s sons, is indulging in Midrash.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 31:11.</i>

Verse 25

A SERVANT OF SERVANTS. <i>Eved avadim</i> (a servant of servants) means a servant like all other servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>eved avadim</i> means a member of the servant class.</i> If Scripture meant a servant to servants then it would have read <i>eved ha-avadim</i>. Proof of this is: <i>it is most holy</i> (kodesh kodashim) (Lev. 6:18), and <i>In a most holy place</i> (be-kodesh ha-kodashim) (Num. 18:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment to Lev. 6:18 where I.E. points out that <i>kodesh kodashim</i> means holy (<i>kodesh</i>) as one of the holy objects (<i>kodashim</i>). When Scripture wants to say most holy it uses the term <i>kodesh ha-kodashim</i>. Similarly had Scripture read <i>eved ha-avadim</i>, it would have meant a servant of (to) servants.</i>
[UNTO HIS BRETHREN.] To Cush, Mizraim and Put, the sons of Ham his father. There are some who say that the Cushites are enslaved because Noah cursed Ham. However, they have forgotten that the first king to rule after the flood was a Cushite. Thus it is written, <i>and Cush begot Nimrod…And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar</i> (Gen. 10:8-10).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the curse was put on the Canaanites and not on all of Ham’s descendants.</i>

Verse 26

BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF SHEM. We are duty-bound to be bountiful in praise of the Lord, who is the God of Shem, for He will make Canaan a servant of God and Shem.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of our verse.</i> The meaning of our verse is, God will compel Canaan to serve Shem, for <i>lamo</i> (their) has the same meaning as <i>la-hem</i> (to them).<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The second half of the verse literally reads, and let Canaan be a servant to them (<i>lamo</i>). I.E. points out that <i>lamo</i> means to them (<i>la-hem</i>) and refers to God and Shem who are mentioned in the first half of the verse.</i> The <i>vav</i> of <i>lamo</i> is superfluous and is similar to the <i>vav</i> of <i>tevi’emo</i> (<i>Thou bringest them in</i>) (Ex. 15:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> of <i>tevi’emo</i> is also superfluous.</i> Therefore the term “to them” is not encountered in Scripture, spelled either without a <i>heh</i> or a <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since the term for them is either <i>la-hem</i> or <i>lamo</i>, the term <i>lam</i> is not found in Scripture (Netter).</i> The Tetragrammaton is invoked in connection with Shem to honor Shem.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The ancestor of the Israelites who worshiped the Lord (Krinsky).</i> It is not employed with regard to Japheth because he was not his brother’s equal. Saadiah Gaon says that <i>Cursed be Canaan</i> is short for cursed be Canaan’s father.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This answers the question: Why was Canaan cursed when it was in fact Ham who allowed his father to lie naked at the doorway of the tent?</i> He says that <i>In the presence of Hanamel my uncle</i> (Jer. 32:12) is similar, as Hanamel was really Jeremiah’s uncle’s son.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Jer. 32:8. We thus see that Scripture employs such abridgments.</i> However, it is possible that Hanamel was older than Jeremiah and the latter referred to him as “my uncle” because it was an honor for him to be called by his father’s title.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that Jeremiah wanted to honor his cousin who was older than he. He did so by calling him uncle. Hence Saadiah cannot offer proof from this verse that Scripture employs this type of abridgment.</i> Similarly one’s father’s brother’s wife is called aunt in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">An uncle is a <i>dod</i>, his wife is a <i>dodah</i>. She is so called in order to honor her, because she is married to one’s uncle. See I.E. to Lev. 18:14.

Verse 27

[ENLARGE.] Saadiah also explains the word <i>yaft</i> (enlarge) as coming from the Hebrew word for beautiful (<i>yafeh</i>).

The previous verse (v. 26) relates the blessing with which Noah blessed God.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">God rather than Shem is the object of the blessing.

AND LET CANAAN BE THEIR SERVANT. To Shem, to Japheth and also to his brothers. Thus Canaan was to be a slave to all of the world, for from Shem, Japheth and Canaan’s brothers all of humanity is descended. This came to pass many years after the flood.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">According to Krinsky, I.E.’s words apply to the blessing and curse uttered by Noah, namely, that God would dwell in the tents of Shem, that he would enlarge Japheth, and that Canaan would be a slave.</i>

Verse 20

THESE ARE THE SONS OF HAM, AFTER THEIR FAMILIES, AFTER THEIR TONGUES. Scripture says the same concerning the children of Japheth<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 10:5.</i> and the children of Shem.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 10:31.</i>

Verse 21

[THE FATHER OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF EBER.] Scripture informs us that Shem was the father of the Hebrews for no one was greater than he, and the Lord was his God. Similarly it is written, <i>Thus saith the Lord, the God of the Hebrews</i> (ivrim) (Ex. 10:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. identifies the children of Eber (<i>ever</i>) with the Hebrews (<i>ivrim</i>).</i> On the other hand, the Bible tells us that Ham was the father of Canaan<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The text reads, Canaan was the father of Ham. The text is obviously corrupt. Ham was the father of Canaan. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, <i>u-khena’an aviv cham</i>. The <i>vav</i> of <i>aviv</i> was dropped in transmission. Thus <i>aviv</i> (his father) became <i>avi</i> (father of).</i> for no one was baser that he. It is unfitting for the holy and profane to intermingle. 
Scripture notes that Shem was <i>the brother of Japheth the elder</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is the literal meaning of <i>achi yefet ha-gadol</i>. From the text it is not clear whether Japheth or Shem was the elder; the grammatical construction is such that elder may apply to either. I.E. is trying to explain why Scripture tells us that Shem was Japheth’s brother, but does not say the same about Ham.</i> to teach us that Japheth, too, was a worthy person. The Bible lists Shem, who was the youngest, before Japheth,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible lists Noah’s sons as Shem, Ham and Japheth (Gen. 5:32; 6:10). According to I.E. the order of their birth was Japheth, Ham and Shem (Krinsky).</i> who was the elder,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra assumes that elder applies to Japheth (see note 20).</i> out of respect to Shem. Proof that Japheth was the elder lies in Scripture’s stating that Noah was five hundred years old when he begat his first son.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 5:32.</i> There is no room for argument, for it is clear that Noah had no children prior to reaching the age of five hundred. The flood came when Noah was six hundred years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 7:6.</i> Therefore if Shem was the eldest he would be one hundred and one years old when Noah and his sons came out of the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The flood lasted a year.</i> However, Scripture tells us <i>Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood</i> (Gen. 11:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Shem reached the age of 100 two years after the flood and could not have been begotten by Noah when the latter was 500 years old. Therefore Shem was not Noah’s eldest son. Japheth was. Thus the elder in verse 21 refers to Japheth.</i> Others say that Shem was <i>the elder brother of Japheth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation explains <i>achi yefet ha-gadol</i> to mean the elder brother of Japheth. According to this interpretation Shem is the eldest.</i> and it is for this reason that Shem is mentioned first. They explain that Shem was born a few days after Noah entered his five hundredth year, for even a day in a year is considered a year.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Thus 499 years plus a few days is considered 500 years.</i> They say that Noah was born in Iyyar<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Noah was 499 years old in Iyyar.</i> and Shem in Sivan.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Shem was thus born in Noah’s 500th year.</i> When the flood came Noah was five hundred and ninety-nine plus a number of days old.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Noah was in his 600th year when the flood began.</i> Hence Shem was not a full ninety-nine years old when the flood started and was a hundred and one years plus a number of months old when his son Arpachshad was born. The meaning of <i>two years after the flood</i> (Gen. 11:10) therefore is to be interpreted as meaning that Arpachshad was born in the second year following the beginning of the flood. There are also those who maintain that the wife of Shem conceived five months after the start of the flood when the waters started decreasing.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Arpachshad was born two years after the flood, i.e., in the second year following the start of the flood.</i> Shem was thus one hundred years old when Arpachshad was born.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Those who put forth this interpretation agree with the second interpretation. However, they are bothered by one problem. If Shem was 100 years plus some months when Arpachshad was born, why does Scripture say that Shem was 100 years old at the time? It should consider him to be 101 since part of a year is considered a year. They solve this problem by assuming that Shem’s wife conceived in the ark five months after the start of the flood, i.e., in Tishri, and gave birth to Arpachshad the following Sivan, some days before Shem’s 100th birthday. Shem, according to this interpretation, was born in Sivan. Scripture thus tells us that Shem was a hundred years old when Arpachshad was born, i.e., 99 years plus. The Bible is thus consistent in listing the years (Cherez).</i> There are ten similar instances in the Book of Kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Where part of a year is considered a year. Krinsky lists the 10 places as: I Kings 15:1, 2, 9; 22:52; II Kings 1:17; 3:1; 8:16; 9:29; 13:10; 14:23; 15:1; 17:1.</i>

Chapter 11



Verse 1

ONE LANGUAGE. When the word one in the feminine is in the absolute it is vocalized with a <i>segol</i> beneath the <i>alef</i> (<i>echat</i>). However, when it is in the construct it is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>alef</i> (<i>achat</i>). In my book on grammar I have explained why the <i>dalet</i> is missing in the feminine word for one.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The masculine word for one is <i>echad</i>; hence the feminine should be <i>achdat</i>.</i> A logical reading of Scripture indicates that the dispersion took place one hundred years after the flood, and that Peleg, which means divided, was so named because at the time of his birth the earth was divided (Gen. 10:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">People were named for events that occurred at the time of their birth. A careful computation of the years from the flood to the birth of Peleg comes to about 100 years. Arpachshad was born two years after the flood; 35 years later he had Shelah. Shelah was 30 when he begot Eber; Eber was 34 when he begot Peleg. Therefore the dispersion took place about 100 years after the flood (Weiser).</i> <i>Peleg</i> is similar to <i>palga</i>, the Aramaic word for half. <i>Palge</i> (rivers) in <i>rivers of water</i> (palge mayim) (Ps. 119:136) is identical. It refers to the branches into which the river divides. The names given to Ichabod (I Sam. 4:21)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And she named the child Ichabod, saying: ‘The glory is departed from Israel,’ because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband</i> (I Sam. 4:21).</i> and Immanuel,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel (God is with us)</i> (Is. 7:14).</i> who was the son of the prophet Isaiah (Is. 7:14), are similar. Nevertheless, the words of the <i>Seder Olam</i> are also correct, and we will rely upon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To the effect that the dispersion took place at the end of Peleg’s life. <i>Seder Olam</i>, Chap. 1.</i> If this is so, then Abraham was one of the builders of the tower of Babel.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Seder Olam</i>, Abraham was 48 years old when the dispersion took place (Chap. 1). Abraham was a descendant of Peleg. If Peleg was born at the time of the dispersion, this would of course preclude Abraham’s being at the tower of Babel. However, if Peleg was so named because the dispersion took place at the end of his life, which consisted of 239 years (v. 18 and 19), then by computing the years listed in verses 18-26 we conclude that Abraham was 48 years old at the time of the building of the tower of Babel. The computation is as follows: Peleg was born 239 years before the dispersion since the latter took place at the end of his life. Peleg was 30 when he begat Reu. Reu was 32 when he begat Serug. Serug was 30 when he begat Nahor. Nahor was 29 when he begat Terah. Terah was 70 when he begat Abraham. We thus have a total of 191. Two hundred thirty-nine minus 191 is 48. Hence Abraham was 48 at the time of the dispersion.</i> Do not be amazed at this,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that Abraham would participate in such a venture. Noah and Shem also took part in it. It is I.E.’s belief that the builders of the Tower did not commit any sin. I.E. will elaborate on this later on in his commentary.</i> for Noah and Shem were also there.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They, too, were saintly men and yet participated in the building of the tower.</i> Indeed, Shem didn’t die till Jacob was over fifty.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Seder Olam</i>, Chap. 1, Jacob studied Torah with Shem for 50 years.</i> The meaning of <i>safah echat</i> is one language. It appears to me that the one language was Hebrew. Proof of this are the names Adam, Eve, Cain, Seth and Peleg.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">All of these are derived from Hebrew roots.</i>
[AND OF ONE SPEECH.] Unlike today, when there are words which not everybody speaking a given language will understand, the learned and the ignorant in those days spoke alike.<i>Achadim</i> (one) is the plural of <i>echad</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Sometimes the word <i>achadim</i> has the meaning of few. Cf. Gen. 27:44, <i>yamim achadim</i> (a few days). I.E. emphasizes that here it means one.</i> 

Verse 2

[AS THEY JOURNEYED EAST.] This verse shows that the mountains of Ararat are in the east.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads: as they journeyed from the east, i.e., from Mt. Ararat or its vicinity. This shows that Mt. Ararat is in the east (Krinsky).</i>
[THAT THEY FOUND A PLAIN.] Its meaning is, they searched for a good place to build a state. Eventually they found this plain. The meaning of <i>bikah</i> (plain) is a flat area; it is the opposite of <i>the rough places</i> (Is. 40:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 40:4 reads, <i>And the rough places (shall be made) a plain</i> (le-vikah). We thus see that <i>bikah</i> is the opposite of rough places. Hence it must refer to a level area.</i> <i>As the cattle go down into the valley</i> (Ba-bikah) (Is. 63:14) is similar. <i>Bikah</i> possibly refers to a plain between mountains because a valley appears to be a split in the hills.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Baka</i> means split. Thus <i>bikah</i> (valley) means a split in the mountains.</i>

Verse 3

LET US MAKE BRICK. <i>Nilbenah</i> (let us make brick) comes from the same root as <i>levenim</i> (bricks). Even though <i>levenim</i> ends in a <i>mem</i>, it is a feminine word.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A feminine plural ends in a <i>vav, tav</i>. The singular of <i>levenim</i> is <i>levenah</i>, hence the feminine <i>va-tehi</i> in conjunction with <i>ha-levenah</i>.</i> Such irregular feminine plural endings are also found in the words <i>nashim</i> (women) and <i>pilagshim</i> (concubines). They baked the bricks until they became hard. A building made from such material is very strong and will not dissolve in water or fall apart when burned.
AND THEY HAD BRICK FOR STONE. In place of stone.
AND SLIME. In place of mortar. The meaning of <i>chemar</i> (slime) is the same as its Arabic cognate.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chamarah</i> in Arabic is a red earthen substance (Weiser).</i> The builders of the tower were not fools to believe that they could actually ascend the heavens. Neither were they afraid that God would bring another flood, for Noah and his children, to whom the Almighty swore never to bring another deluge, were there and being descendents of Noah and his children they were subservient to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If their intention was to rebel against God, then Noah and Shem would have stopped them. I.E. rejects the notion that the builders of the tower wanted to ascend the heavens and wage war with God. Cf. <i>San</i>. 109a.</i> Scripture reveals their intention and ultimate goal. They wanted to build a great city to dwell in, and a very tall tower to ensure their fame and glory and to serve as a sign indicating the place of the city to those outside it, such as shepherds. The tower, as long as it stood, would also perpetuate their names after their deaths. This is the meaning of <i>and let us make us a name</i>. 

Verse 4

The word <i>havah</i> (come) means give;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>yod, heh, bet</i> means give. Cf. Rashi on Gen. 38:16: “The expression <i>havah</i> denotes preparation except where it is to be rendered giving, and even in those instances where <i>havah</i> denotes preparation it is close in meaning to giving.”</i> its root is <i>yod, heh, bet</i>, as is clear from <i>Cast thy burden</i> (yehavecha) <i>upon the Lord</i> (Ps. 55:23). Because <i>haveh</i> is used often, it remains the same in both the feminine and the plural. Compare, <i>come</i> (havah),<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Strictly speaking, since many are being addressed, <i>havu</i> should be used.</i> <i>let us deal wisely with them</i> (Ex. 1:10), and <i>Come</i> (havah),<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Since a female is being addressed <i>havi</i> should be used.</i> <i>I pray thee, let me come in unto thee</i> (Gen. 38:16). 
Do not be surprised at the phrase <i>with its top in heaven</i>. Moses similarly said, <i>the cities are great and fortified up to heaven</i> (Deut. 1:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The words of Moses are definitely not to be taken literally. Similarly neither is <i>with its top in heaven</i>.</i> The builders of the tower hoped that their city and tower would prevent them from dispersing, but this was not God’s will. However, they did not know this.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">They did not intend to rebel against God. They were merely ignorant of His will.</i>

Verse 5

[AND THE LORD CAME DOWN.] The Bible states this because all things on earth below are dependent upon the powers on high; all actions are arranged from heaven. Therefore God is referred to as the One <i>Who rideth upon the heaven</i> (Deut. 33:26) and the One who is <i>enthroned in the heavens</i> (Ps. 123:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">“God cannot come into contact with the material and changeable” (Husik, p. 191). He rules the lower world via the heavenly beings. “Ibn Ezra holds that the events of the sublunar world are governed by the positions and motions of the heavenly bodies, which in turn are determined by the intelligences or angels” (<i>Ibid</i>., p. 192).</i> The use of the term <i>And the Lord came down</i> is an anthropomorphism.

Verse 6

AND THE LORD SAID: BEHOLD, THEY ARE ONE PEOPLE. God said this to the angels. This took place before <i>And the Lord came down</i>. Its meaning is: And the Lord came down because he said, <i>Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language</i>, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">It is unlikely that God would first go down and then say, <i>Come, let us go down</i> (Filwarg). In other words, verse 5 belongs after verse 7 (Cherez). Our translation follows Filwarg who reads <i>terem</i> in place of <i>ta’am</i>.</i>
ONE PEOPLE. They have one religion. Different religions create jealousy and hatred among people. The same is true with regard to different languages. That is why the king of Persia and Media commanded <i>that every man should bear rule in his own house, and speak according to the language of his people</i> (Es. 1:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The use of only one language per household would prevent strife in that family.</i> The <i>heh</i> of <i>hachillam</i> (what they begin) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> because of the <i>chet</i> which follows it.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">
The <i>heh</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>chataf pattach</i> as is the rule concerning all double roots in the <i>hifil</i> perfect.</i> The <i>heh</i> of <i>hachiloti</i> (I have begun) (Deut. 2:31) is similarly vocalized.
[WITHHOLDEN.] <i>Yibbatzer</i> means will be withholden. <i>Betzurot</i> (fortified) in <i>fortified</i> (betzurot) <i>cities</i> (Deut. 3:5)<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cities so constructed that they hold back any enemy from entering.</i> is like it. The meaning of our verse is: If I permit them to go on, they will think that they can do whatever they wish.
[THEY PURPOSE.] <i>Yazemu</i> (they purpose) has the same meaning as <i>zamemu</i> (devised).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 19:19. <i>Yazemu</i> comes from the root <i>yod, zayin, mem</i>; <i>zamemu</i> from the root, <i>zayin, mem, mem</i>.</i> However, they come from different roots.

Verse 7

COME, LET US GO DOWN. This is what God said to the angels.
[AND THERE CONFOUND THEIR LANGUAGE.] All the grammarians claim that <i>ve-navelah</i> (and confound) is a <i>nifal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>ve-navelah sham sefatam</i> (and there confound their language) means, and their language will be there confounded, the <i>nun</i> of <i>ve-navelah</i> being the <i>nun</i> of the <i>nifal</i>.</i> They compare it to <i>ve-navekah</i> (and shall be made empty) in <i>And the spirit of Egypt shall be made empty</i> (ve-navekah) (Is. 19:3) and to <i>navelah</i> (fadeth) in <i>The earth fainteth and fadeth away</i> (navelah) (Is. 24:4). However, their interpretation is farfetched. Why would the Bible say: Come, let us go down and their language will be confounded, when their language was not confounded because God and the angels went down?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">God’s going down did not in itself confound their language.</i> <i>Ve-navelah</i> can only be interpreted as an active verb.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, and we will confound, its <i>nun</i> not being the sign of the <i>nifal</i> but of a first person plural imperfect prefix.</i> Proof of this is Scripture’s stating at the close of this incident, <i>because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth</i> (v. 9). The following is then the grammatical explanation of <i>ve-navelah</i>. It is a <i>hifil</i>. Scripture should have employed the entire root and read <i>ve-navlilah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This is the way a double root is conjugated in the <i>hifil</i>. The root of <i>ve-navelah</i> is <i>bet, lamed, lamed</i>.</i> or <i>ve-navellah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This is the way a double root is conjugated in the <i>hifil</i> when one of the letters of the double root is dropped (swallowed) in the conjugation. In this case <i>ve-navelah</i> has a <i>tzere</i> beneath the <i>bet</i> and a <i>dagesh forte</i> in the <i>lamed</i>. The <i>dagesh</i> doubles the <i>lamed</i> and thus compensates for the missing <i>lamed</i>.</i> if one of the two <i>lameds</i> of its double root was swallowed. In the latter case it would have followed the paradigm of <i>ve-nasebbah</i> (let us bring back)<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which is <i>samekh, bet, bet</i></i> in <i>and let us bring back</i> (ve-nasebbah) <i>the ark of our God</i> (I Chron. 13:3). Our word reads <i>ve-navelah</i> because one of the <i>lameds</i> of the root was dropped without the remaining <i>lamed</i> receiving a <i>dagesh forte</i> to make up for it. The sages who translated the Torah into Greek correctly rendered <i>ve-navelah</i> as I will confound,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The sages thus understood <i>ve-navelah</i> as an active form, <i>we will confound</i>.</i> rather than we will confound.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">They did this so that the readers of their translation would not think there are many gods. Cf. <i>Megillah</i> 9a.</i> If the above mentioned grammarians are correct, why did the sages omit the <i>nun</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>ve-navelah</i> is passive (<i>nifal</i>), meaning it will be confounded, why did the sages who translated the Bible into Greek change <i>ve-navelah</i> to <i>ve-avelah</i>? Obviously the sages saw it as active, meaning we will confound, hence the change from the plural to the singular.</i> Some say that the people building the tower started hating each other and each one invented a new language. Others say that the One who grants knowledge to man caused them to forget their language. In my opinion, they were first scattered. After their dispersion Nimrod ruled over Babel and other kings arose. With the passage of time and the death of the first generation to be scattered, the original language was forgotten.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the confounding of the language did not take place at one time; it was a slow process. God first dispersed them. This led to the eventual confounding of the original language.</i> God scattered the people for their own benefit. He similarly said, <i>and replenish the earth</i> (Gen. 1:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That is, populate all of the earth, not merely one area of it.</i>

Verse 8

[AND THEY LEFT OFF TO BUILD THE CITY.] Its meaning is: they left off from completing the city because part of the city and the tower had by this time been built. This is so for Scripture reads, <i>the city and the tower, which the children of men builded</i> (v. 5).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5 tells us that God <i>came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded</i>. This indicates that some part of the tower and city had already been completed.</i> It is also possible that the meaning of <i>which the children of men builded</i> is: which the children of men intended to build.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation verse 5 should be interpreted to mean: God came down to see the tower and city which the children of men intended to build. He stopped them before they commenced building.</i> <i>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel</i> (Josh. 24:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Balak never fought Israel. The meaning of the verse is: then Balak…arose and intended to fight Israel.</i> is similar. The first of these interpretations appeals to me.

Verse 9

BABEL. <i>Bavel</i> (Babel) is made up of the words <i>ba</i> (came) and <i>bel</i> (confusion),<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>bel</i> is a noun from the root <i>bet, lamed, lamed</i> (Weiser). <i>Bavel</i> thus means a confusion came.</i> with the <i>alef</i> missing. <i>Bagad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>alef</i> of <i>ba</i> in <i>bagad</i> is missing. <i>Bagad</i> is a compound of <i>ba</i> and <i>gad</i>.</i> (Fortune is come) (Gen. 30:11) and <i>Bamah</i> (high place) (Ezek. 20:29)<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 20:29 explains the word <i>bamah</i> (a high place) as coming from the word <i>ba</i> (visit) and <i>mah</i> (what). Thus the <i>alef</i> is missing.</i> are similar.

Verse 10

[TWO YEARS AFTER THE FLOOD.] I have already explained the meaning of this in the verse <i>the elder brother of Japheth</i> (Gen. 10:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In his comments on Gen. 10:32, I.E. explains that two years after the flood means a year and some days into the second year following the flood.</i> It is possible that Peleg was given this name on the day of his death, the reason for this being as follows: Shem lived for five hundred years following the flood, Arpachshad lived for four hundred and thirty-eight years, his son Shelah lived four hundred and thirty-three years, and his son Eber four hundred and sixty-four years. Now Peleg lived two hundred and thirty-nine years. Thus Peleg’s life span was half that of his ancestors. Reu, the son of Peleg, similarly lived to the same age as Peleg. Reu’s son Serug also lived about the same number of years as Peleg and Reu.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For textual proof of these life spans see verses 11-23.</i> This, then, is the general rule: no one after Peleg, aside from his son, ever lived to be two hundred and thirty-nine years.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. suggests that Peleg was so called at his death because in his time the life span of man was cut in half. Peleg, as I.E. notes above (Gen. 10:25), means half. He now interprets <i>for in his days was the earth divided</i> (10:25) to mean in his days was the life span of the earth’s inhabitants cut in half.</i> Some say that those who built the tower numbered seventy and hence were divided into seventy languages upon their dispersion.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbinic tradition there are 70 primary languages.</i> If you count the sons of Shem, Japheth and Ham you will find them to be seventy.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Listed in Chap. 10 of Genesis.

First of all <i>Pathrusim</i> and <i>Casluhim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Listed among the descendants of Ham in Gen. 10:14.</i> are not the names of two individuals.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">They are the names of nations. Hence they can’t count as two people. Thus we already have more than 70.</i> Furthermore, they neglect to include in the seventy Noah and his sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Who were alive at the time of the building of the tower. Again we have more than 70.</i> According to the <i>Seder Olam</i> the builders of the tower numbered thousands and ten thousands.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Seder Olam</i> the dispersion took place when Abraham was 48 years old. By then the world’s population had grown to the number indicated by I.E. (Weiser).</i>

[AND BEGOT ABRAM.] Abraham was born in a place called Ur of the Chaldees. <i>Therefore glorify ye the Lord in the regions of light</i> (be-urim) (Is. 24:15)<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In Isaiah, I.E. offers two definitions of the word <i>urim</i>: (a) boundaries, i.e., countries or regions; (b) valleys. According to (a) the verse reads: in the regions, honor God. According to (b) the verse should read: In the valleys honor God. The same apparently applies to the term <i>Ur Chasdim</i>. Hence <i>Ur Chasdim</i> means the land of the Chaldees, or the valley of the Chaldees. In Isaiah, I.E. prefers interpretation (a).</i> is like it. It appears to me that at the time of Abraham’s birth Ur of the Chaldees had another name since the Chaldees are descended from Nahor, the brother of Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Via his son Chesed. Cf. Gen. 22:22.</i> and that in writing the Torah Moses used the name in vogue in his time when he cited Ur of the Chaldees. Proof that Abraham was born in Ur of the Chaldees can be found in the fact that Haran died there and Scripture says, <i>And Haran died…in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees</i> (v. 20).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets <i>his nativity</i> as referring to the entire family of Terah (Krinsky).</i> It is also possible that the Chaldees made a flame (altar) and the place thereof was called Ur (the flame, altar) of the Chaldees. In this instance Ur has the meaning of fire, as in <i>whose fire</i> (ur) <i>is in Zion</i> (Is. 31:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. earlier explains <i>Ur</i> as meaning a region or valley (see note 55).

Verse 29

[AND THE NAME OF NAHOR’S WIFE, MILCAH.] The Bible gives the name of Nahor’s wife in order to let us know the pedigree of Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 22:20-23.</i> Our sages, of blessed memory, identified Iscah with Sarah.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 69b.</i> If this is a tradition we will accept it.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">There is no proof from Scripture that it is so; hence if it is an exegetical point we may dispute it.

Similarly if Sarah was the sister of Lot<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">If we identify Sarai with Iscah, then Sarai is Lot’s sister, since Haran was the father of both Lot and Iscah (v. 29 and 31) (Cherez).</i> the Bible would have stated, “and Sarai the daughter of his son,” as it does in the case of Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible states with regard to Lot, <i>And Terah took…Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son</i> (v. 31). It does not say the same with regard to Sarai. It merely says, <i>and Sarai his daughter-in-law</i>.</i> It is possible that Terah’s son Nahor left for Haran before his father. On the other hand he may have left for Haran after his father went there.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible doesn’t mention that Terah took Nahor as it does with regard to Abraham. However, we find Nahor’s children living in Haran. Thus it appears that he, too, journeyed there, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It appears to me that the portion containing the command, <i>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee</i> (Gen. 12:1), was conveyed to Abraham before what is recorded in the verse reading, <i>And Terah took Abram…Lot…Sarai…to go into the land of Canaan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 12:1 occurred before Gen. 11:31.</i> Similarly elsewhere the Pentateuch states, <i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt</i> (Num. 1:1); and then, <i>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year</i> (Ex. 40:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i> this is a difficult comment. Num. 1:1 follows Ex. 40:17; hence the verses are in chronological sequence. I.E. probably intended to cite Num. 9:1, rather than Ex. 40:17. The former literally reads: In the second year…in the first month. He apparently cited from memory and misquoted. Perhaps he wanted to note that Num. 7 records the setting up of the Tabernacle and the sacrifices then offered by the princes of the tribes. However, Ex. 40:17 tells us that the tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month in the second year following the Exodus. We thus see that what is described in Num. 1 occurred after what is described in Num. 7 (Krinsky).</i> Proof of the above<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>Get thee out</i>, etc., was told to Abraham before <i>And Terah took</i>, etc. If God had not yet told Abraham to go to Canaan, why did Terah take his family there? I.E. apparently believes that the impetus behind Terah’s journey to Canaan was God’s command to Abraham, recorded in Gen. 12:1 (Weiser).</i> is found in <i>And they went forth…to go into the land of Canaan</i> (v. 31). When Terah came to Haran, the place found favor in his eyes. He settled there and eventually died there. The general rule thus is that the Bible does not always list events in chronological order.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

GET THEE OUT. God commanded Abraham while he was yet in Ur of the Chaldees to leave his country, his place of birth and also his father’s house. The reason God told Abraham to leave his father’s house is that the Lord knew that, although he set out for Canaan, Terah would settle in Haran.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra implies that had Terah gone to Canaan then God would not have commanded Abraham to separate himself from his father.</i> Terah did not die until sixty years after Abraham left his father’s house in Haran.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Terah was 70 when Abraham was born (Gen. 11:26). Abraham was 75 when he left Haran (Gen. 12:4). Terah was thus 145 when Abraham left him. Terah lived 205 years (Gen. 11:32). Hence Terah lived another 60 years after Abraham left Haran. Thus the command “Get thee out” could not have come after Terah’s death, as a cursory reading of Scripture would indicate (Krinsky).</i> However, the Bible does not tell us how old he was when he left Ur of the Chaldees.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>He</i> refers to Abraham (Cherez). The Bible tells us how old Abraham was when he left Haran (v. 4) but does not tell us his age when he left Ur of the Chaldees. Had the Bible told us this, we would then know how long Abraham dwelt in Haran. Weiser explains <i>he</i> as referring to Terah. I.E.’s point remains the same.</i> After telling Abraham to go <i>unto the land that I will show thee</i>, God revealed his secret to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He told him which land He had in mind.</i> for we read: <i>and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan</i> (v. 5). It is also possible <i>that I will show thee</i> refers to <i>for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it</i> (Gen. 13:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of the phrase is: the land which I will show thee will I give to thee (Cohen). Abraham went from place to place. When he came to Canaan God then told him, this is the land that I have chosen for you (Cherez). According to this interpretation God did not at this point reveal to Abraham his ultimate destination.</i>

Verse 5

THEIR SUBSTANCE. Their cattle.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The term used by Ibn Ezra is <i>mikneh</i>, which includes cows, sheep, asses and camels.</i> <i>Rekhusham</i> (their substance) in <i>And the land was not able to bear them…for their</i> (rekhusham) <i>substance</i> (i.e., their cattle) <i>was great</i> (Gen. 13:6) is similar.
AND THE SOULS THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN IN HARAN. Servants born into their household.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Had gotten</i> thus means: were born to them (Weiser).</i> It is also possible that <i>had gotten</i> means bought.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Previously Ibn Ezra explained <i>gotten</i> as meaning born. He now explains it to mean bought (Weiser).</i> <i>Hath gotten</i> in <i>My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth</i> (Deut. 8:17) is similar. Others say that <i>the souls that they had gotten in Haran</i> refers to the people to whom Abraham showed the truth, to worship God.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:14. Cf. Rashi.</i>
[AND THEY WENT FORTH TO GO.] To the place that God had told them to go.

Verse 6

[SHECHEM.] Shechem<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Like Ur of the Chaldees.</i> was the name used by Moses because it was the name by which the city was known in his time. Shechem was not yet born in Abraham’s day.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ibn Ezra, Shechem was named after Shechem son of Hamor. Cf. Gen. 34:2.</i>
TEREBINTH. <i>Elon</i> (terebinth) has the same meaning as <i>elah</i> (terebinth).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Is. 6:13 and Hos. 4:13. <i>Elon</i> is a type of <i>elah</i> (Krinsky).</i> They are trees. Others say that <i>elon</i> means a field,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the field of Paran, as seen from Gen. 14:6. See also Onkelos on this verse.</i> as in <i>unto El paran</i> (Gen. 14:6).
MOREH. Some identify him with Mamre, the confederate of Abraham. However, it is possible they are not to be so identified and Elon Moreh is the name of a place.
AND THE CANAANITE WAS THEN IN THE LAND. It is possible that the Canaanites seized the land of Canaan from some other tribe at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Canaanite was then, not before this, in the land. Cf. Rashi: “The Canaanite was then engaged in conquering the land of Israel from the seed of Shem.”</i> Should this interpretation be incorrect, then there is a secret meaning to the text. Let the one who understands it remain silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The verse implies that the Canaanite was in the land then but not now (Krinsky). Since the Canaanite was in the land during the days of Moses, this clause would appear to be post-Mosaic.</i>

Verse 7

AND THE LORD APPEARED. In a prophetic vision. <i>Va-yera</i> (appeared) is a <i>nifal</i>. It is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i> to make up for the <i>dagesh</i> which should have been placed in the <i>resh</i> as compensation for the missing <i>nun</i> of the <i>nifal</i> conjugation.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>nun</i> of the <i>nifal</i> is omitted in the imperfect. Hence all imperfect <i>nifal</i> forms have a <i>dagesh</i> in the first letter of the root, i.e., <i>yikkatev</i>, rather than <i>yikhatev</i>. However, the <i>resh</i> of <i>ra’ah</i> (saw), from the root <i>resh, alef, heh</i>, cannot receive a <i>dagesh</i>. Hence it is preceded by a <i>tzere</i>, rather than a <i>chirik</i>. <i>Va-yera</i> is an imperfect changed into a perfect by the <i>vav</i> conversive.</i>
WHO APPEARED UNTO HIM. <i>Nireh</i> is a participle belonging to the above-mentioned conjugation (<i>nifal</i>). <i>Na’aseh</i> (prepared) in <i>Now that which was prepared</i> (na’aseh) <i>for one day</i> (Neh. 5:18) is similar.

Verse 8

AND HE REMOVED. <i>Va-yatek</i> (and he removed) is a transitive verb, in the <i>hifil</i>. However, <i>ve-yetak</i> (removed) in <i>Or shall the rock be removed</i> (ve-yetak) <i>out of its place</i> (Job 18:4) is intransitive. The object of <i>And he removed</i> is <i>his tent</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>va-yatek</i> (and he removed) is transitive, it does not mean he removed himself but he removed his tent.</i> <i>His tent</i> is also the object of <i>he pitched</i>. The meaning (of <i>va-yatek</i>) is: he caused to move. <i>Va-yet</i> (he pitched) is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i> to make up for the missing <i>nun</i> which is the first root letter of <i>va-yet</i> (he pitched).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>va-yet</i> (pitched) is <i>nun, tet, ayin</i>. We would have expected the word to be vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>. Compare, <i>va-yitteh</i>, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> <i>Ve-yez</i> (is dashed) in <i>And their lifeblood is dashed</i> (ve-yez) (Is. 63:3) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>ve-yez</i> (is dashed) is <i>nun, zayin, heh</i>.</i> Both are transitive verbs.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yatek</i> and <i>va-yet</i> (Krinsky) or <i>va-yet</i> and <i>ve-yez</i> (Cherez).</i>
[ON THE WEST.] The word <i>mi-yam</i> means on the west. <i>Yam</i> (sea) means west because the great Spanish Sea (<i>yam</i>, i.e., the Mediterranean) is the western border of the land of Israel. The latter sea is not the Atlantic, the Atlantic being far from the aforementioned country. Abraham journeyed from east of Beth-el westward until Ai was east of his camp.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumes that Abraham journeyed from east to west. He crossed over Ai but stopped before Beth-el. Thus Beth-el was on his west and Ai on his east. However, the interpretation presents a problem. Shechem lies north of Beth-el and Ai. Thus Abraham traveled south not west.</i>
[AND CALLED UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD.] This means he prayed there. It may also mean that he called upon men to worship the Lord.

Verse 9

TOWARD THE SOUTH. <i>Negev</i> means south and it means the same in Aramaic.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that <i>negev</i> is an Aramaic word.</i> <i>Negev</i> in Aramaic means dry as we see from Onkelos, who renders <i>the waters were dried up</i> (Gen. 8:13) as <i>negivu mayya</i>. The south is called <i>Negev</i> (dry) because it is hot there, and the heat parches the land. This is the way <i>for that thou hast set me in the Southlands</i> (eretz ha-negev)<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>eretz ha-negev</i> means a dry land.</i> <i>give me therefore springs of water</i> (Josh. 15:19) should be understood.

Verse 10

AND THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND. In the land of Canaan.

Verse 11

WHEN HE WAS COME NEAR. When he caused his camp to come near.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes <i>hikriv</i> (he came near) to be a transitive verb, its meaning being: when he caused to come near, i.e., when he caused his camp to come near.</i> On the other hand, <i>hikriv</i> (when he came near) may be intransitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In this case <i>hikriv</i> is to be rendered, when he came near.</i> These two interpretations are possible because there are verbs which can be transitive and intransitive.
[NOW.] <i>Na</i> means now. <i>Na</i> in <i>Behold now</i> (na), <i>I am old</i> (Gen. 27:2), and <i>Woe</i> (na) <i>unto us</i> (Lam. 5:16)<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ibn Ezra this should be rendered: woe now unto us.</i> are similar. The reverse of Hebrew is the case in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The Arabic word for now is <i>malan</i>, rather than <i>malna</i> (Weiser).</i>
[BEHOLD NOW, I KNOW.] There were women as beautiful as Sarah in her native country,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture emphasizes <i>now I know</i>, i.e., before I didn’t. This is so because in the country from which she came there were other beautiful women. In Egypt Sarah’s beauty stood out.</i> but in Egypt and the southern land there was none as beautiful. The reason for this is that people’s appearance is shaped by the climate.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the climate of southern countries is not conducive to the development of beautiful women.</i>
[BUT THEE THEY WILL KEEP ALIVE.] They will provide for all of your needs. Abraham said this because those were days of famine.

Verse 12



Verse 13

[THOU ART MY SISTER.] <i>Achoti</i> (my sister) is penultimately accented<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Ordinarily the accent would be placed on the last syllable.</i> because the word which follows it, <i>at</i> (thou), is accented on the first letter. <i>Kara laylah</i> (he called night) (Gen. 1:5) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ordinarily the accent would be placed on the last syllable of <i>kara</i>.</i> The preceding is a general rule in Hebrew grammar.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">When the cantillical notes connect two words and the second word is penultimately accented, so is the first word even though it is ordinarily ultimately accented.</i> The <i>tav</i> of <i>at</i> (thou) receives a <i>dagesh</i> to make up for the missing <i>nun</i>, for the word <i>at</i> (thou) comes from the same root as <i>ani</i> (I).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hence thou in the feminine should be <i>ant</i>, in the masculine <i>antah</i> (Netter). The printed editions read, the word <i>attah</i> comes from the same root as <i>ani. Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, the word <i>at</i> comes from the same root as <i>ani</i>. Since I.E. deals with the feminine, the reading of Vat. Ebr. 38 is to be preferred.</i>
BECAUSE OF THEE. <i>Bi-glalekh</i> (because of thee) and <i>ba-avurekh</i> (for thy sake) always have a <i>bet</i> prefixed to each.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The forms <i>gelalekh</i> (<i>gelal</i>) or <i>avurekh</i> (<i>avur</i>) are not used.</i> The poet who omits this <i>bet</i> errs.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, turns aside from discretion. Ibn Ezra uses a term from Prov. 11:22, <i>As a ring of gold in a swine’s snout, So is a fair woman that turneth aside from discretion</i>. He implies that the poet who deliberately misuses language is like a fair woman who turns aside from discretion. The reference might be to Rabbi Simon ben Isaac of Mayence, an eleventh century liturgical poet who wrote, <i>avur ki fanah yom</i> (now that the day has declined). He should have written <i>ba-avur fanah yom</i>. Rabbi Simon’s composition is found in the concluding service of the Day of Atonement (Cherez). It should be noted that I.E. employs a pun. <i>Shar</i> is a poet. <i>Sar</i> means tumeth aside, hence <i>ha-shar sar</i>, the poet turneth aside.</i>
[THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH ME.] They will give me gifts and presents. And so it is written, <i>And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servant, and she-asses, and camels</i> (v. 16).

Verse 16



Verse 17

AND THE LORD PLAGUED PHARAOH…BECAUSE OF SARAI. The term <i>al devar</i> means because. <i>Al devar</i>’s meaning is <i>al zeh ha-davar</i> (on account of this thing).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>al devar</i> means because. According to the Midrash <i>al devar Sarai</i> means according to Sarah’s word. (Cf. Rashi.) Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 18

[THOU TELL ME.] The root of <i>higgadta</i> (thou tell) is <i>nun, gimel, dalet</i>.

Verse 19

[SO I TOOK HER TO BE MY WIFE.] This indicates that Pharaoh took her to be his wife, to sleep with her. God brought plagues upon him to prevent him from touching her. The Lord sent these plagues to protect the wife of the one whom he loved. The plagues were so severe that Pharaoh was unable to touch Sarah. The following is analogous: <i>When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies…and seest among the captives a woman of goodly form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and takest her to thee to wife</i>. The Bible then says, <i>then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head</i>. It then concludes, <i>and after that thou mayest go in unto her</i> (Deut. 21:10-13).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra argues that wife here has the meaning of a sexual partner as it does in Deuteronomy. For it first says, “and takest her to thee to wife” and concludes with “thou mayest go into her” (Weiser). Krinsky and Cherez argue that I.E. was disturbed by the term <i>took her</i> which implies that Pharaoh had intercourse with Sarah. Hence I.E. points out that Scripture is merely relating Pharaoh’s intentions; i.e., he <i>took her</i> to be his wife but God intervened before he had a chance to sleep with her. I.E. quotes Deut 21:10 where “and thou takest her to wife” similarly does not mean “and sleeps with her” because one cannot have intercourse with a captive woman until certain procedures described in Deut. 21 are first undergone.</i>
[AND GO THY WAY.] The <i>vav</i> of <i>va-lekh</i> (and go thy way) is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> would ordinarily be vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>.</i> because it is prefixed to a word with a cantillical note that ends a phrase. The <i>vav</i> of <i>va-yayin</i> (and wine) in <i>bread and wine</i> (Gen. 14:18) is similar.

Verse 20

AND THEY BROUGHT HIM ON THE WAY. They honorably escorted him.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yeshallechu oto</i> (and they brought him on the way) might conceivably be translated as they sent him away; i.e., they expelled him, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> <i>And Abraham went with them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham obviously did not expel the angels, he accompanied them out of respect.</i> <i>to bring them on the way</i> (Gen. 18:16) is similar.
[AND PHARAOH GAVE MEN CHARGE CONCERNING HIM.] It appears to me that this clause indicates that Pharaoh issued a command to his people concerning Abraham. He warned and charged that it be announced that no one harm Abraham and his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>gave men charge concerning him</i> is not to be connected to <i>and they brought him on the way</i>. <i>Gave men charge</i>, etc., means he issued commands that Abraham not be molested; <i>and they brought him on the way</i> means they escorted him. I.E. interprets this verse thus because he believes that the word <i>tzivvah</i> (commanded, charged) with the preposition <i>al</i> (on) involves a prohibition. Cf. I.E.’s comments on Gen. 2:16 (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 1

[AND ABRAM WENT UP.] I have grammatically explained the word <i>va-ya’al</i> (and went up) in my <i>Book of Foundation</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-ya’al</i> (and he went up) is short for <i>va-ya’aleh</i>.</i>

Verse 2

AND ABRAM WAS VERY RICH. <i>Ve-avram kaved me’od</i> (literally, Abram was very heavy) means that Abraham had great wealth. Whoever is laden with riches moves heavily (with difficulty).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the use of the term <i>kaved</i> (heavy) for rich.</i> Don’t you see that the Hebrew word for honor (<i>kavod</i>) comes from the same root as the word for heavy (<i>koved</i>) in <i>A stone is heavy</i> (koved even) (Prov. 27:3). Conversely, the word for shame (<i>kalon</i>) comes from the same root as the word for light (<i>kal</i>). Compare, <i>light of foot</i> (kal beraglav) (II Sam. 2:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the root <i>caf, bet, dalet</i> in its various forms means heavy. <i>Kavod</i> (honor) really means heavy with glory. Similarly <i>kaved</i> means heavy with possessions.

Verse 5

AND TENTS. I believe that <i>ohel</i> (tent), in the singular, follows the paradigm of <i>kodesh</i> (holy). It is always found in Scripture following this form.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kodesh</i> is vocalized <i>cholam, segol</i>. Similarly, <i>ohel</i>. The latter is the term used in the Bible for tent.</i> In the plural, its <i>alef</i> is vocalized with a <i>chataf kamatz</i>, as in the verse <i>ye shall dwell in tents</i> (Jer. 35:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The plural of <i>kodesh</i> is similarly vocalized with a <i>chataf kamatz</i> beneath the <i>kof</i>.</i> It is vocalized like the word <i>kodashim</i> in <i>he shall not eat of the holy things</i> (ba-kodashim) (Lev. 22:4). However, when the <i>alef</i> of the Hebrew plural for tents is vocalized with a <i>cholam</i>, the singular is vocalized like <i>goral</i> (lot).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized <i>cholam kamatz</i>. In our verse tents (<i>ohalim</i>) is vocalized with a cholam. Hence its singular cannot be <i>ohel</i>, for the singular of <i>ohalim</i> is <i>ohal</i> (<i>cholam kamatz</i>). I. E.’s point is that the Hebrew word for tent can come in two forms, <i>ohel</i> or <i>ohal</i>.</i> The latter is so even though this form for tent (<i>ohal</i>) is not found in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If this is so, we would expect to find the form <i>ohal</i> in Scripture.

Verse 6

TOGETHER. <i>Yachdav</i> (together) can refer to two (as in our verse) or to many, as in <i>And all the people answered together</i> (yachdav) (Ex. 19:8). This word does not follow the rules of Hebrew grammar.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It does not have a <i>yod</i> between the <i>chet</i> and the <i>vav</i> as do all other similar plural forms (Weiser).</i> <i>Yachdav</i> is not synonymous with <i>yachad</i> (together). <i>Yachdav</i> means acting like one person.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">That is, their individuality is blended, as in <i>And all the people answered together</i> (yachdav) (Ex. 19:8), which means that all the people answered as if they were one person. <i>Yachad</i> implies two people acting at the same time, but each one by himself (Weiser).</i>

Verse 8



Verse 9

THEN I WILL GO TO THE RIGHT. <i>Ve-e’minah</i> (I will go to the right) comes from the same root as <i>yamin</i> (right).
[THEN I WILL GO TO THE LEFT.] The <i>alef</i> of the noun <i>semol</i> (left) is enunciated in the verb <i>ve-asme’ilah</i> (then I will go to the left). Now this <i>alef</i> is missing in the word <i>hasmili</i> (direct thyself to the left) in <i>Go thee one way to the right, or direct thyself to the left</i> (Ezek. 21:21). Thus, we cannnot determine whether the <i>alef</i> is part of the root of <i>semol</i> or not.

Verse 10

THE PLAIN OF THE JORDAN. <i>Kikkar</i> (plain) means an area with plants. The <i>caf</i> is doubled in <i>kikkar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The word for an area with plants being <i>kar</i>, as in Is. 30:23. Our word reads <i>kikkar</i> because the <i>caf</i> is doubled.</i> On the other hand, it is possible that one <i>caf</i> has been dropped in <i>kar nirchav</i> (large pastures) (Is. 30:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The basic word being <i>kikkar</i>.</i> Similarly <i>bat</i> (apple of) in <i>bat ayin</i> (the apple of the eye) (Ps. 17:8) is short for <i>bavat</i> in <i>bavat eno</i> (the apple of his eye) (Zechariah 2:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>bet</i> has been dropped in <i>bat</i>, for the full word is <i>bavat</i>, with two <i>bets</i> (Krinsky).

WELL WATERED. <i>Mashkeh</i> (watered) is masculine; <i>khullah</i> (well) is feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">If Scripture were consistent the phrase would have read <i>khullah mashkah</i>.</i> <i>A fire not blown by man shall consume him</i> (Job 20:26)<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Te’okhlehu</i> (shall consume him) is feminine; <i>nuppach</i> (blown) is masculine. Hence Scripture uses both a masculine and feminine word in reference to the same thing (fire). It does the same in our verse with regard to <i>kikkar</i>.</i> is similar.
BEFORE THE LORD DESTROYED SODOM AND GOMORRAH. <i>Shachet</i> (destroyed) is an infinitive in the <i>pi’el</i>. The meaning of <i>li-fene shachet</i> is: before the Lord destroyed.

Verse 11

AND LOT JOURNEYED. From the east,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is I.E.’s translation of <i>va-yissa lot mi-kedem</i> (and Lot journeyed east). According to I.E., Lot journeyed west to Sodom, away from Abraham who was in Beth-el. The problem with I.E.’s interpretation is that Sodom lies east, not west of Beth-el. Because of this difficulty the Midrash homiletically interprets the clause to mean: He removed himself from the ancient one (<i>mi-kedem</i>) of the universe saying, I desire neither Abraham or his God (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 41:7). As to the problem raised by Sodom lying east of Beth-el, Weiser suggests that in order to reach Sodom from Beth-el one had to journey westward first and then eastward. However, this interpretation is forced. M.S. Siegal in his commentary on Genesis suggests that <i>mi-kedem</i> here has the meaning of eastward, or that <i>mi-kedem</i> is short for <i>mi-kedem levet-el</i>; i.e., Lot journeyed east of Beth-el, where Abram had pitched his tent. As to I.E., he most probably was not aware that Sodom lies east and not west of Beth-el.</i> for Sodom is west of Beth-el.

Verse 12

AND MOVED HIS TENT. Pitched his tent.

I.E.’s point is that <i>sad</i> and <i>sid</i> mean the same although they come from different roots (Weiser).</i> (Deut. 27:2) and <i>sad</i> (plaster) in <i>Thou puttest my feet also in the plaster</i> (ba-sad)<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is I.E.’s interpretation of the verse. In Job he explains the verse to mean God had plastered Job’s feet with whitewash so that He could follow Job’s every step. I.E. points out that <i>siddim</i> is the plural of <i>sad</i> in Job. The <i>sin</i> and <i>samach</i> interchange.</i> (Job 13:27). <i>Sad, siddim</i>, is like <i>pat</i> (morsel of bread), <i>pittim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">We would expect the plural of <i>sad</i> (Job. 13:27) to be <i>saddim</i>.

Similarly the plural of <i>sad</i> is <i>siddim</i> and not <i>saddim</i> (Krinsky and Cherez).</i>
VALE. The word vale is to be understood as if written twice.

There the text literally reads, <i>O, Lord, rebuke me not</i> (al) <i>in Thine anger, chasten me in Thy wrath</i>. I.E. says that the verse should be read, O Lord rebuke me not (<i>al</i>) in Thine anger, chasten me not (<i>al</i>) in Thy wrath.

In other words, when <i>be’er</i> refers to live wells it is vocalized <i>sheva tzere</i>; when it refers to pits it is vocalized <i>segol, chataf segol</i> (Krinsky, Netter, Cherez).

Had God sworn an oath, Abraham would not have asked for a sign (Krinsky).</i> Hence Abraham did not sin in requesting that a covenant be made between God and himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That the land of Canaan be unconditionally given to his descendants. I.E.’s view is in contradistinction to a Midrashic view which held that Abraham sinned in asking for a sign. Cf. <i>Nedarim</i> 32a.</i>

Verse 9

A SHE-GOAT OF THREE YEARS OLD. Some render <i>ez meshuleshet</i> as three she-goats.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos, Rashi.</i> However, it appears to me that the correct translation of the phrase is: a she-goat three years old.
AND A RAM. A full grown male sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A ram is a male sheep older than a year (Krinsky).</i>
AND A YOUNG PIGEON. <i>Gozal</i> is a young dove.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>gozal</i> can also be translated as a fledgling. It can thus refer to any bird. Cf. Deut. 32:11.</i> It is to be rendered this way because burnt offerings and other sacrifices were brought only from among the animals and birds mentioned here.

Verse 10

AND DIVIDED THEM IN THE MIDST. He cut them up and separated the pieces. <i>Bater</i> (split) in <i>Upon the split mountains</i> (hare bater)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s rendering, i.e., mountains that are split or divided by valleys. Cf. Segel’s commentary on Canticles.</i> (Cant. 2:17) and <i>betarav</i> (parts of) in <i>between the parts thereof</i> (betarav) (Jer. 34:18) are analogous to <i>va-yevater</i> (and divided them).
AND LAID EACH HALF OVER AGAINST THE OTHER. Note that the word <i>ish</i> (each)<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ish</i> usually means a man. However, our verse reads, <i>ish bitro</i> (each half) and deals with animals. Hence I.E. explains that <i>ish</i> does not necessarily mean man. Here it refers to animals. Its meaning is, the half of each animal.</i> means the same as <i>ba’al</i>, which means the thing itself. Similarly, <i>ish</i> (man) in <i>The Lord is a man</i> (ish) of <i>war</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">We cannot translate <i>ish milchamah</i> as a man of war, as God is not a man. It must mean: the Lord is a being who wages war (Cherez).</i> (Ex. 15:3); and <i>ish</i> (man) in <i>the man</i> (ve-ha-ish) <i>Gabriel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Gabriel is an angel. Therefore the phrase cannot mean the man Gabriel, but rather Gabriel himself.</i> (Dan. 9:21); and <i>ish</i> (fellow) in <i>a base fellow</i> (ish beliyya’al) (II Sam. 20:1). In the latter verse it is in the construct.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to Weiser. This is a most difficult comment. It is hard to understand what I.E. is trying to say. Obviously <i>ish</i> is in the construct with <i>beliyya’al</i>. Cherez writes that he does not understand this comment at all. Filwarg emends <i>ish beliyya’al</i> to <i>ish-ba’al</i> (II Kings 1:8), the point being that we find <i>ish</i> and <i>ba’al</i> in apposition; i.e., <i>ish</i> and <i>ba’al</i> mean the same. Thus <i>ish-ba’al</i> is similar to <i>admat-afar</i> in Dan. 12:2, where <i>admat</i> means the same as <i>afar</i>.</i> <i>Ish</i> is also used in reference to the living creatures seen by Ezekiel,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Their wings were joined one</i> (ishah) <i>to another</i> (Ezek. 1:9).</i> and to the curtains of the Tabernacle, viz., <i>Five curtains shall be coupled together one</i> (ishah) <i>to another</i> (Ex. 26:3). The meaning of our clause is that he placed the piece of each one (<i>ish</i>) over against its counterpart. The term <i>ish</i> is to be so interpreted because man and beast are two different beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ish</i> must be interpreted as meaning a thing, the very thing. Otherwise it could not refer both to man and beast since they are totally different beings.</i>
BUT THE BIRDS DIVIDED HE NOT. The turtle dove and the young dove. <i>Tzippor</i> (birds) is a general term.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>tzippor</i> refers both to the turtle dove and to the young dove.</i>

Verse 11

THE BIRDS OF PREY. <i>Ayit</i> (birds of prey) is a type of bird. <i>Ayit</i> (bird of prey) in <i>Is my heritage unto Me as a speckled bird of prey</i> (ha-ayit) (Jer. 12:9) is similar.
UPON THE CARCASSES. On the lifeless bodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture uses the term <i>pegarim</i> (carcasses) and not <i>betarim</i> (pieces). The reference is to the carcasses of the turtle dove and the young dove (Krinsky).</i>

It should be noted that <i>ayit</i> (birds of prey) is in the singular. I.E. takes it as a collective noun.</i> <i>Yashev</i> (he caused to blow) in <i>He causeth His wind to blow</i> (yashev rucho) (Ps. 147:18) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>nun, shin, bet</i> means to blow. Similarly in our verse Abraham drove the birds off by causing a wind to blow over them, i.e., by flapping at them.</i> On the other hand, he may have flapped at the carcasses to drive the bird of prey off them.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the <i>them</i> refers to the carcasses and <i>ayit</i> refers to one bird. The verse is to be interpreted as follows: the bird of prey came down…and Abraham flapped at the carcasses and drove “it” off.</i>

Verse 12

Verse 13

THAT THY SEED SHALL BE A STRANGER IN A LAND THAT IS NOT THEIRS. In Hebrew a person who has a family is likened to a branch attached to its source. Therefore such an individual is called an <i>ezrach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 12:49. Cf. Lev. 16:29, 18:26, 19:34, 24:16; Num. 9:14. Ps. 37:35 has been rendered in accordance with I.E.’s interpretation in Psalms. <i>Ezrach</i> means native-born. According to I.E. one born in the land is called an <i>ezrach</i> because he is like a branch attached to its tree. It should be added that I.E. points out in his comments on Gen. 2:25 that the Bible compares man to a tree.</i> for the meaning of <i>ezrach</i> is a branch, as in <i>a sprouting tree with many branches</i> (ke-ezrach ra’anan) (Ps. 37:35). On the other hand, a stranger is termed <i>ger</i> in Hebrew from the word <i>gargir</i> (berry), for he is like a berry plucked from a branch. There are some unintelligent people who find this explanation farfetched. However, if they knew the meaning of each letter and its form then they would recognize the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra discusses the meaning and form of letters in his <i>Sefer Ha-Tzachot</i>. He explains that <i>gimel</i> means finished, or weaned (<i>gamal</i>), and <i>resh</i> cut. A poor person is called a <i>rash</i> because he is cut off from his sources. <i>Ger</i> is spelled <i>gimel, resh</i>; it thus means a person weaned and cut off from his family (Cherez, Netter).</i>
FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. Until the end of this period (four hundred years) starting from this very day.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In Ex. 12:40, I.E. writes that the 400 years started with the birth of Isaac. Some versions have “from Isaac’s birth” in our text.</i>

BUT THOU SHALT GO TO THY FATHERS. A euphemism for a natural death.
[IN PEACE.] Unlike your enslaved descendants, you will die in dignity.

Verse 16

AND IN THE FOURTH GENERATION THEY SHALL COME BACK HITHER. Many of the commentaries misunderstood the meaning of the word <i>dor</i> (generation).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">They explain generations as a specific number of years. Cf. I.E.’s commentary on Job 42:16 in which he notes, <i>Isaac the windbag erred in saying that a generation spans 35 years</i>. In Deut. 7:9 he quotes an opinion that a generation is 36 years.</i> The sages of the Talmud said there were ten generations from Adam to Noah.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 5:2. The sages speak of generations in terms of people, not years. Each one of those mentioned had a life span that differed from the other. Hence <i>dor</i> cannot refer to a fixed number of years.</i> We also find, <i>to a thousand generations</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">If a generation is a fixed number of years then a thousand generations is a thousand times that number. In Deut. 7:9, I.E. argues that it cannot be so. Cf. I.E.’s comments on Deut. 7:9.</i> (Deut. 7:9) and Job speaks of four generations (Job 42:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In Job the four generations come to 140 years. We thus see that a generation is not a fixed number of years, for each time it is encountered it does not refer to the same number of years.</i> In my opinion the meaning of <i>dor</i> (generation) is dwells. Compare <i>dur</i> (dwell) in <i>Than to dwell</i> (mi-dur) <i>in the tents of wickedness</i> (Ps. 84:11). A generation is measured by a person’s life span. Some are long and some are short. Our verse refers to the fourth generation starting from the first that lived as strangers in Egypt. Thus it is written, <i>thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land</i> (Deut. 23:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This verse spells out that the Hebrews were strangers in Egypt.</i> And so it was: Kohath, Amram, Moses and Aaron were strangers in Egypt. Their children, who were the fourth generation, returned to the land of Canaan.
FOR THE INIQUITY OF THE AMORITE IS NOT YET FULL. I have explained the meaning of <i>iniquity</i> in my comments on <i>My punishment is greater than I can bear</i> (Gen. 4:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Iniquity at times means punishment. That is its meaning in this verse; i.e., I have not yet finished punishing them (Cherez).</i> The Amorites are singled out because they were the most powerful of the Canaanite peoples.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Actually this verse refers to all the inhabitants of Canaan.</i> Behold, the great kings whom Moses slew were Amorites.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 2:24-36; 4:47. The Bible singles out these kings as being mighty (Weiser).</i> Furthermore, it was five Amorite kings who united to fight Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 10:5.</i> There are other proofs.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In Scripture that the Amorites were the most powerful inhabitants of Canaan.</i> Similarly the prophet says concerning the Amorites, <i>Whose height was like the height of the cedars, And he was strong as the oaks</i> (Am. 2:9). Whoever says that <i>Emori</i> (Amorite) comes from the same root as <i>amar</i> (saying) does not contribute anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets <i>the iniquity of the Amorite</i> (avon ha’emori) to mean the sin for saying (<i>avon ha-amirah</i>): O Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it. <i>Pesikta Zutarta</i>, Gen. 15:16.</i>

Verse 17

AND IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN. Until now the sun had not yet set. It is similarly written, <i>when the sun was about to go down</i> (v. 12).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This is the literal meaning of <i>va-yehi ha-shemesh la-vo</i> (when the sun was going down). We thus see that what transpired until now took place before the sun went down.</i>
THICK DARKNESS. <i>Alatah</i> (thick darkness) means darkness. The word <i>alatah</i> is also found in Ezekiel (12:6, 7, 12). It means a cloudy night. It might also refer to the darkness that sets in as soon as the last light has disappeared in the clouds.
BEHOLD A SMOKING FURNACE, AND A FLAMING TORCH. An image of a smoking furnace with a flaming torch in it.
BETWEEN THESE PIECES. <i>Ben ha-gezarim</i> means between the pieces. This<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The passing of the smoking furnace with the flaming torch inside it between the pieces.</i> was the actual taking of the oath. <i>The words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof</i> (Jer. 34:18) is similar. We thus read in the next verse, <i>In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, ‘Unto thy seed have I given this land,’</i> etc.

Verse 18

Verse 20

AND THE REPHAIM. This is what <i>That also is accounted a land of Rephaim</i> (Deut. 2:20) refers to.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The point of I.E.’s comment is that <i>Rephaim</i> in our verse refers to the land of Rephaim and not to the Rephaim per se, since the latter were not Canaanites (Weiser). However, Krinsky explains that the Rephaim were a branch of the Canaanites.</i> Do not be surprised that Scripture lists the Canaanite and after him the Jebusite.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Canaan was the father of these nations. Why, then, list him between the Kenites and Jebusites (Meijler)?</i> Note: Each one of the seven nations that dwelled in Canaan were Canaanites. They descended from Canaan, who fathered eleven sons. Elsewhere Scripture lists six Canaanite nations by their specific names and includes the remainder under the term Canaanite.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Canaan refers to the Canaanite people (Weiser).</i> In our chapter Scripture lists ten of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Two are included in the name Canaan.</i> At other times Scripture includes them all in the term Canaanite without enumerating them. Scripture similarly states, <i>Judah and Israel were many</i> (I Kings 4:20) even though the term Israel includes Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the Bible at times is especially explicit. Similarly, although Canaanite can refer to all seven nations, the Bible mentions Canaanite and then notes a number of them.</i>

Verse 2

IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL BE BUILDED UP. <i>Ibbaneh</i> (I shall be builded up) comes from the same root as <i>ben</i> (son).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>ibbaneh</i> (I shall be builded up) means I shall have a son.</i> It is possible that the word for son (<i>ben</i>) comes from the root <i>bet, nun, heh</i> (to build), with the <i>heh</i> dropped because, metaphorically speaking, the father serves as the foundation and the son as the building.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. comments thusly because the root of <i>ibbaneh</i> is obviously <i>bet, nun, heh</i>.</i> <i>Chai</i> (life) in the third person perfect and in the adjectival form is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>chet, yod, heh</i>.</i>
AND ABRAM HEARKENED. Abraham said yes to her.

Verse 3

AFTER ABRAM HAD DWELT TEN YEARS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN. Our sages, of blessed memory, transmitted a law that a man shall not remain married more that ten years to a woman who has not borne him a child. They used this verse as sort of a support for this law. It is a good support.

Verse 4

WAS DESPISED. The <i>tzere</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The letters added to the root to indicate that it is in the imperfect are, with the exception of the first person singular, always vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> in the <i>nifal</i>.

He is referring to the <i>tzere</i> which has a <i>yod</i> sound.</i> in <i>va-tekal</i> (was despised) is in place of the <i>dagesh</i> which should be placed in the <i>kof</i> to make up for one of the missing root letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>lamed</i>. The root of <i>va-tekal</i> (was despised) being <i>kof, lamed, lamed</i>. This comment is difficult.

FOUND HER. <i>Va-yimtza’ah</i> (found her) is irregular.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse should have read, <i>va-yimtza’eha</i>.</i> It should have been vocalized like <i>va-yisna’eha</i> (and he hateth her) (Deut. 22:16).

Verse 8

I FLEE. The <i>resh</i> of <i>borachat</i> (I flee) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> because it is followed by a guttural.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The second radical of a participle in the feminine is usually vocalized with a <i>segol</i>.

The reason the middle letter of the root of the above words is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> is that it precedes gutturals. They are: <i>alef, chet, heh, ayin</i>. This is the rule. There is no exception.

Verse 11

BEHOLD THOU. <i>Hinnakh</i> (behold thou) is the form used when a female is being addressed, because it is a preposition.

ISHMAEL. The <i>alef</i> of Ishmael is not pronounced to simplify enunciation.

Verse 12

A WILD ASS OF A MAN. He will be free among men.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As a wild ass is. No one controls the wild ass or places a burden on him. Similarly Ishmael shall be a free and uncontrolled person. The Hebrew has <i>pereh adam</i>, literally, wild ass-man, hence the different interpretations which follow.</i> Compare, <i>Who hath sent out the wild ass free</i> (Job 39:5). The meaning of our clause is that no stranger will rule over him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser.</i> Others say that we should render <i>perah adam</i> (a wild ass of a man) by a wild ass and a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a connective <i>vav</i> should be placed before <i>adam</i> (man).

Verse 13

A GOD OF SEEING. <i>Ro’</i> i (seeing) follows the paradigm of <i>oni</i> (affliction).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ro’</i> i, like <i>oni</i>, is a noun (Krinsky) and both are vocalized with a <i>chataf kamatz</i> beneath the first letter.</i> Compare, <i>I am the man that hath seen affliction</i> (oni) (Lam. 3:1). The meaning of <i>a God of seeing</i> is a God who appears in visions.
HAVE I EVEN HERE. The commentaries translate <i>halom</i> as now.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to Weiser.</i> However, its correct meaning is here. <i>Halom</i> (hither) in <i>Is there yet a man come hither</i> (halom) (I Sam. 10:22) is similar.

Chapter 17



Verse 1

GOD ALMIGHTY. <i>Shaddai</i> is an adjective meaning mighty. <i>Shaddai</i> in <i>like a mighty voice</i> (ke-kol shaddai)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Our translation follows that of I.E. Cf. Kimchi on Ezek. 1:24. I.E.’s point is that here, too, <i>Shaddai</i> is an adjective meaning mighty.</i> (Ezek. 1:24) is similar. Also, <i>Shaddai</i> in <i>And mighty will be thy silver</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. on Job. 22:24, 25 renders <i>betzer</i> by <i>kesef</i> (silver). <i>And mighty will be thy silver</i> means you will have a great amount of money.</i> (shaddai betzarekha) (Job 22:25) is similar because the word <i>betzarekha</i> (thy silver) has the same meaning as the word <i>betzer</i> (silver) in <i>And lay thy treasure (or silver)</i> (betzer) <i>in the dust</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the verse is to be rendered: And mighty (<i>Shaddai</i>) will be thy silver. Thus <i>Shaddai</i> is an adjective meaning mighty</i> (Job 22:24). The word <i>Shaddai</i> follows the paradigm of <i>davvai</i> (faint), in <i>And my heart is faint</i> (davvai) (Lam. 1:22). Many derive <i>Shaddai</i> from the same root as <i>shoded</i> (overpowering),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Brown, Driver and Briggs (<i>Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament</i>) define <i>shoded</i> as: deals violently with, despoils, devastates, ruins. Cf. Jer. 6:26. Thus <i>shoded</i> has the connotation of overpowering. In keeping with the concept of I.E., but more important out of respect to God, we have translated <i>shoded</i> as overpowering.</i> meaning, He is victorious and overpowering. The reason God used this name at this time was to impress upon Abraham the fear of God so that he would circumcise himself. The correct interpretation of the divine names is as follows: <i>Shaddai</i> is an adjective describing God’s power over creation. The Tetragrammaton, God’s revered and awesome name, stands in contrast to it. The world exists by virtue of these two names.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Tetragrammaton expresses God’s essence, His eternality, and His being the cause of all existence. <i>Shaddai</i> emphasizes His power over creation. Thus these two names stand opposite each other; i.e., these names teach that there is an Eternal God who created all (Tetragrammaton) and has the power over all (<i>Shaddai</i>). Furthermore, on a more “practical” level it is via the Tetragrammaton that the world was created, and via the name <i>Shaddai</i> that nature is overcome. Others comment that the Tetragrammaton stands for creation and <i>Shaddai</i>, for destroying or limiting the creation (Krinsky). See I.E.’s comment on Ex. 3:15, 6:3.</i> Whoever understands the secret of God’s name will accept my interpretation.
AND BE THOU WHOLE-HEARTED. Do not question the reason for circumcision.

ABRAHAM. The new name with the addition of the <i>resh</i> means the mighty one of a multitude of nations. This is so because the new name did not come to diminish a letter from Abraham’s original name but to add one.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i> there is no meaning for the <i>resh</i> in Abraham. I.E. argues that it does not have a meaning, for the <i>resh</i> is an integral part of the new name. Abraham means <i>avir hamon goyim</i>, for <i>av hamon goyim</i> with the <i>resh</i> added gives <i>avir hamon goyim</i>. I.E. is in contradistinction to Rashi who comments that the <i>resh</i> in Abraham was carried over from Abram and did not signify anything. We have followed <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 in our translation, which reads, <i>Abraham im tosefet ha-resh avir hamon goyim</i>.</i>

[EVERY MALE AMONG YOU SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED.] <i>Himmol</i> (shall be circumcised) is to be read as if it had a <i>lamed</i> prefixed to it. It is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it means shall be circumcised. <i>Himmol</i> might be taken to be an imperative, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It belongs to the verbs having a <i>vav</i> as the middle letter of their root.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is an <i>ayin, vav</i>, its root being <i>mem, vav, lamed</i>.</i> It is like <i>va-yamal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Whose root is also <i>mem, vav, lamed</i>.</i> in <i>and circumcised</i> (va-yamal) <i>the flesh of their foreskin</i> (v. 23). It follows the paradigm of <i>le-hikkon</i> (to be prepared).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ez. 38:7; Amos 4:12. The root of <i>le-hikkon</i> is <i>caf, vav, nun</i>. <i>Le-himmol</i> is the same form as <i>le-hikkon</i>. Both <i>le-himmol</i> and <i>le-hikkon</i> are <i>nifal</i> infinitives.</i>

Verse 11

AND YE SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED. <i>U-nemaltem</i> (and ye shall be circumcised) is similar to <i>u-shemartem</i> (and ye shall keep).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>U-shemartem</i> is a <i>kal</i>. Similarly <i>u-nemaltem</i> (and ye shall be circumcised) is a <i>kal</i>, meaning: and ye shall circumcise.</i> The <i>nun</i> of <i>u-nemaltem</i> is a root letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>nun, mem, lamed</i>. There are thus two roots meaning to circumcise, viz., <i>nun, mem, lamed</i> and <i>mem, vav, lamed</i>.

(Rendering Gen. 6:3 according to I.E. See I.E. on Gen. 6:3).</i>

Verse 12

SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED AMONG YOU. <i>Yimmol</i> (shall be circumcised) is a <i>nifal</i>, as are <i>himmol yimmol</i> (must needs be circumcised) (v. 13). Why does Scripture state twice, <i>He that is born in thy house…must needs be circumcised</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13 seems to repeat what is in verse 12. I.E. asks why.</i> This is the answer: Scripture first states that in the future all males, those of thy seed and also those <i>born in the house or bought with money</i>, shall be circumcised on the eighth day. It then states, “ Abraham immediately circumcise all males <i>born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money</i> although they are adults.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It might have been thought that since the command speaks of circumcision on the eighth day, those past that age when the command was given were exempt. Thus verse 12 speaks of the future and verse 13 of the present. Thus there is no repetition.</i>

Verse 13



Verse 14

AND THE UNCIRCUMCISED MALE WHO IS NOT CIRCUMCISED. <i>Yimmol</i> (is circumcised) is a <i>kal</i>. It is like <i>yiddor</i> (voweth) in <i>When a man voweth</i> (yiddor) <i>a vow</i> (Num. 30:3). It comes from the same root as <i>u-nemaltem</i> (and ye shall be circumcised) in <i>and ye shall be circumcised</i> (u-nemaltem) <i>in the flesh of your foreskin</i> (v. 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. renders both <i>yimmol</i> and <i>u-nemaltem</i> as <i>nifals</i>. I.E. renders them as <i>kals</i>, as actives whose root is <i>nun, mem, lamed.</i>. Our verse should thus be rendered: And the uncircumcised male who does not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin.</i> The meaning of the verse is, a male who reaches the age when he is obligated to observe the commandments of the Torah and does not circumcise himself is subject to the penalty of <i>karet</i> (being cut off). The verse refers to an adult because while a person is yet a child, the obligation to circumcise him falls upon his father. However, should his father fail to do so, then upon reaching maturity he must circumcise himself. <i>Karet</i> (being cut off) is a penalty inflicted by God. Those who err hold that a child that dies uncircumcised does not have a share in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It is for this reason that Jews customarily circumcise, prior to burial, a child who dies uncircumcised. Cf. <i>Shulchan Arukh Yoreh Deah</i> 263:5. It is clear from I.E.’s refutation of the belief that an uncircumcised child does not have a share in the world to come that those who held this view based it on the verse: <i>And the uncircumcised male…that soul</i> (nefesh) <i>shall be cut off from his people</i> (v. 14). They interpreted <i>nefesh</i> as soul and cut off as referring to the world to come (Weiser).</i> However, the meaning of the word <i>nefesh</i> is not as they think, a soul<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">They translated <i>nefesh</i> as soul.</i>, but a person; it means a body containing a soul. Similarly, <i>If anyone</i> (nefesh) <i>shall sin</i> (Lev. 4:2). Some say that <i>karet</i> refers to death before the age of fifty-two. Others say it means the eradication of one’s name via the death of one’s children. Therefore Scripture states, <i>that soul shall be cut off from his people</i>, for a person who leaves children is considered to live on even after his death, and his name is not cut off.

Verse 15



Verse 16

AND MOREOVER I WILL GIVE THEE. <i>Natati</i> (I will give thee) in our verse is like <i>natati</i> in <i>I will give</i> (natati) <i>the price of the field</i> (Gen. 23:13). Observe, although both are perfects, they are to be rendered as imperfects.

Verse 17

SHALL A CHILD BE BORN UNTO HIM THAT IS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD. Abraham was amazed at being told that he would have a son because the sperm of an old man is cold<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Medieval medicine believed in four humors.</i> and therefore aged men are infertile. However, he was even more amazed that Sarah, a woman whose menstrual cycle had ceased, would bear a child, since the embryo is made and constructed from the woman’s menstrual blood. If you will reflect you will conclude that Sarah’s conceiving was a greater wonder than Abraham’s begetting a child. For we find instances of men over ninety begetting children in later generations,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">However, we do not find in Scripture any report of an aged woman bearing a child. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, “We find that King David’s forefathers each sired a son when over 90.” Cf. I.E.’s comment on Ruth 4:17.</i> and the life span of people in Abraham’s time was much longer than in later times.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since men of later generations whose life spans were shorter than that of Abraham sired children when over 90, it diminishes the uniqueness of Abraham’s experience. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, “The life span of people in Abraham’s generation was longer than that of David’s generation.”</i> As soon as the angel left, Abraham immediately circumcised Ishmael and all those born in his house and those bought with money.

IN THE SELFSAME DAY. Abraham did not hesitate to carry out the commandment of circumcision. Behold, Abraham’s household consisted of three hundred eighteen males <i>born in his house</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. 14:15.</i> aside from those <i>bought with his money</i>. After circumcising them, Abraham circumcised himself on that very day.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible states, <i>And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money…and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day</i> (v. 23). After stating this, Scripture notes, <i>And Abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised</i> (v. 24). Thus Abraham was circumcised last.</i> Now Ishmael his son plus all those born in his house and bought with his money were voluntarily circumcised with him (Abraham) (v. 27). For the meaning of “with him” (v. 27) is that Abraham did not have to force his household to comply with God’s commandment. They all voluntarily hurried to do and fulfill God’s will.

Verse 27

WERE CIRCUMCISED WITH HIM. <i>Nimmolu</i> (were circumcised) is a <i>nifal</i>. Its root is <i>nun, mem, lamed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hence there is a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>mem</i> of <i>nimmolu</i> to make up for the missing <i>nun</i> of the root. The <i>nun</i> of <i>nimmolu</i> is the <i>nun</i> of the <i>nifal</i>.</i> <i>Ve-nishlo’ach</i> (were sent) in <i>And letters were sent</i> (ve-nishlo’ach sefarim) (Est. 3:13) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>cholam</i> in <i>nimmolu</i> presents a problem. When a letter having a <i>nun</i> as the first letter of its root is conjugated in the <i>nifal</i> as a <i>shelamim</i> it is not vocalized with a <i>cholam</i> (Weiser). I.E. thus points out that we find the same with <i>nishlo’ach. Nishlo’ach</i> is a <i>shelemim nifal</i> and it, too, is vocalized with a <i>cholam</i>, i.e., <i>nishlo’ach</i> rather than <i>nishlach</i> (Filwarg).</i>

Chapter 18



Verse 1

AND THE LORD APPEARED. Behold, a few say that God is three men: He is one and He is three and they are inseparable.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This comment of I.E. is cryptic. Krinsky sees in it an allusion to the Christian doctrine of trinity. According to him, <i>a few say</i> refers to the Christians. Filwarg disagrees. He insists that I.E. is merely saying that God’s revelation took the form of three angels appearing to Abraham. One can argue on behalf of Krinsky that the Christians did use this verse as “proof” of their doctrine of trinity. And indeed, I.E.’s language seems to support Krinsky. On the other hand, would I.E. refer to the Christians as <i>a few say</i>, thereby giving some credence to their trinitarian interpretation? Furthermore, Rashbam accepts this interpretation minus, of course, its trinitarian aspects. Commenting on this verse, Rashbam says, <i>And the Lord appeared to him. How? Three men who were angels came to him</i>. Thus Rashbam interprets this verse in a way similar to the phrase <i>a few say</i> quoted by I.E. Hence <i>a few say</i> may very well refer to a Jewish interpretation. However, it should be noted that Saadiah Gaon, in rejecting the doctrine of trinity, writes, “Others (finally) conjecturing about the implication of the passage, <i>And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre</i> (Gen. 18:1), declare that the thing that appeared to Abraham and was designated by this name was a trinity because Scripture later on explicitly states: <i>And, lo, three men stood over against him</i> (Gen. 18:2). Let me explain, then, that these are more ignorant (than the opinions concerning God’s essence previously refuted) because they did not wait until they reached the end of the passage. For had they had patience until they heard the verse: <i>And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i> (Gen. 18:22), they would have realized that the <i>men</i> had departed while the light of God remained stationary with Abraham, who was in its presence. The thought therefore that God was identical with these men is completely refuted” (<i>The Book of Beliefs and Opinions</i>, Rosenblat translation, p. 108). Reading Ibn Ezra’s comments side by side with that of Saadiah seems to leave no doubt that both deal with the same group, the Christians. Indeed, it seems that Saadiah was the source of I.E.’s comments.</i> They forget that Scripture expressly states, <i>And the two angels came to Sodom at even</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 19:1. This verse clearly shows that the three are separable and thus cannot refer to God. The <i>few say</i> state that the three are inseparable.</i> However, the commentaries tell us<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps the term <i>mefareshim</i> (commentators) is used to indicate that what they say is acceptable in contrast to the first ones quoted who are not even deemed Biblical commentators. See preceding notes.</i> that God first appeared to Abraham in a vision after which Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw three angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi.</i> One came to bring happy tidings to Sarah<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That she would have a son.</i> and the other two went on to Sodom, one to destroy it and one to save Lot. 
The meaning of <i>And they did eat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Angels do not eat.</i> (v. 8) is that the bread was consumed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The angels caused the bread to be consumed. Thus it appeared to have been eaten.</i> Eaten, in our verse, has the same meaning as the identical word in <i>whereto the fire hath eaten</i> (consumed) (Lev. 6:3).

[FORASMUCH AS YE ARE COME.] <i>Ki al ken avartem</i> (forasmuch as ye are come) means the same as <i>ho’il va-avartem</i> (since you are come) in Rabbinic Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ki al ken</i> means the same as the Rabbinic term <i>ho’il</i> (since). The Hebrew <i>ki al ken</i> can also be explained to mean, for this reason; i.e., the verse can be read: I will fetch a morsal of bread and stay your heart…for this reason (to eat) are ye come to your servant (Netter), hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is like <i>forasmuch as</i> (ki al ken) <i>as they are come under the shadow of my roof</i> (Gen. 19:8).

Since the root <i>lamed, vav, shin</i> is not often found in Scripture, I.E. quotes an additional verse to illustrate its meaning (Filwarg). Cherez explains that since <i>lushi</i> is a transitive verb we would expect to find the object “dough,” i.e., knead the dough, as in <i>and the women knead the dough</i> (Jer. 7:18). Hence I.E. points out that occasionally the word dough is left out, as in I Sam. 28:24.</i>

Abraham sat in the tent door and consequently could not see Sarah. Others say that the door of Sarah’s tent was behind the tent of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>ve-hu</i> is to be rendered: and it.

PLEASURE. The word <i>ednah</i> means pleasure and enjoyment. <i>Va-yitaddenu</i> (and luxuriated) in <i>and luxuriated</i> (va-yitaddenu) <i>in Thy great goodness</i> (Neh. 9:25) is similar. The meaning of our verse is: How can the enjoyment and pleasure of youth be renewed in me, seeing that I have waxed old and aged and my husband, too, is old.

Verse 13

WHOM AM OLD. This explains <i>After I am waxed old</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Sarah said, <i>achare viloti</i> (after I am waxed old).

They interpret <i>ani zakanti</i> (I whom am old) as referring to Sarah’s statement of <i>va-adoni zaken</i> (my lord being old also). I.E. disagrees with this interpretation (see note 17).</i> 
The <i>mem</i> of <i>umnam</i> (of a surety) is not a root letter. It is like the <i>mem</i> of <i>shilshom</i> (the day before yesterday) (Gen. 31:5). Other commentators maintain that Abraham’s three guests were prophets. If one should argue, why would God send a message via a prophet to Abraham who himself was a prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">God could have revealed his prophecy to Abraham directly, as he did to the three prophets who visited him. What need was there to send a prophet to him?</i> since it is only when one prophet is greater than the other, as in the case of Moses who was sent with a prophesy to Aaron,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ex. 4:14-16, 28.</i> that God transmits his intentions to a prophet through another prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was obviously the greatest prophet in his generation.</i> then they would answer that the three prophets came not to Abraham but to Sarah. Indeed, Scripture explicitly states, <i>And they said unto him: Where is Sarah thy wife</i> (v. 9).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This indicates that the message was for Sarah.</i> After one of the prophets delivered the message to Sarah, the other two went on to Sodom. Also, do not be troubled by the clause <i>for we will destroy this place</i> (Gen.19:13),<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A prophet cannot destroy a city. An angel can. Therefore, this clause implies that they were angels.</i> as we find a similar expression with regard to Moses and Aaron: <i>And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh</i> (Ex. 11:10). In reality God did the wonders and they were attributed to Moses and Aaron because they were the agents by which the miracles were performed. Now according to this interpretation, <i>and they did eat</i> (v. 8) is to be taken literally. Similarly, according to this interpretation, the term <i>Adonai</i> (Lord) in <i>My lord</i>, (Adonai) <i>if now I have found favor in thy sight</i> (v. 3) does not refer to the Deity, but means my lords. Hence there is a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>nun</i>, and it is not vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> as would be the case if it referred to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Adonai</i> with a <i>pattach</i> means my lords; with a <i>kamatz</i>, it means Lord.</i> However, in those copies of the Pentateuch where <i>Adonai</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> the term must be interpreted as: O prophet of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In our copies of the Pentateuch, <i>Adonai</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>.</i> Also (according to the aforementioned interpretation), the reason Abraham said, <i>if now I have found favor in thy sight</i> (v. 3)<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">If Abraham addressed three prophets why did he employ the singular <i>be-enekha</i> ?

There are still others who say that the verses are not in order of their occurrence.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Abraham first saw the angels (v. 2-16) and then God appeared to him (v. 1). According to this interpretation the Bible introduces the chapter with a statement that God appeared to Abraham. It then tells us that before God appeared to Abraham angels visited him. Scipture then records what God told Abraham when He appeared to him (v. 17-21). According to the earlier interpretation God first appeared to Abraham and then Abraham saw the angels.</i> According to this interpretation, <i>And he lifted up</i> (v. 2) is to be interpreted: and he had already lifted up his eyes and looked and done so and so. After this, God appeared to him and said, <i>Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing</i>, etc. (v. 17), and <i>Verily the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great</i>, etc. (v. 20). <i>But Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i> (v. 22) when the two angels who left for Sodom arrived there. In any case,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Whichever of the above interpretations we adopt.</i> <i>And the Lord said: Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing</i>, etc., relates either to what God directly revealed to Abraham or to what He told the angels to relate to Abraham. However, all opinions agree that <i>And the Lord said: Verily the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and verily their sin is exceedingly grievous</i>, etc. (v. 20 and 21), definitely records God’s words to Abraham. Upon hearing this, Abraham drew near and said, <i>Wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked</i>, etc. (v. 23-32).<i>And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i>, (v. 22) is a parenthetical statement noting that at the very moment that the men came to Sodom, God told Abraham, <i>Verily, the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great</i>. This is similar: <i>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul: ‘Bid the servant pass on before us - and he passed on - but stand thou still at this time, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God’</i> (I Sam. 9:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And he passed on</i> is a parenthetical statement.

However, out of respect for God the Scribes reversed the passage to read: <i>But Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i>. Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 49:7; <i>Va-yikra Rabbah</i> 11:5. For the reason that the Midrash assumed the verse originally read: but the Lord yet stood before Abraham; see Rashi and Krinsky. I.E. claims that there never was, in fact, any scribal emendation, as the literal meaning of the text does not support such an assumption (Filwarg).</i> from <i>but the Lord stood yet before Abraham</i> to <i>but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i>. Indeed, the verse <i>And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord</i> (Gen. 19:27) proves that there was no scribal emendation.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This verse clearly states that it was Abraham who stood before the Lord.</i> I will allude to my own beliefs with regard to the appearance of the angels in my commentary on the first Torah portion of Exodus.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Following Krinsky.

Verse 19



Verse 20

[VERILY THE CRY OF SODOM.] Either the cry of its blasphemy or the cry of those victimized by its violence.
AND, VERILY, THEIR SIN IS EXCEEDINGLY GRIEVOUS. And the earth cannot bear it.

Verse 21

[I WILL GO DOWN NOW, AND SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE DONE ALTOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE CRY OF IT.] Some say this verse is to be interpreted as follows: If they have done so then I will destroy them (<i>kalah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>kalah</i> (altogether) means destruction. <i>If they have done so</i> is I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>whether they have done according to the cry of it, which is come unto me</i>.</i>
AND IF NOT, I WILL KNOW. <i>Eda’ah</i> means I will have pity upon them. They similarly interpret <i>va-yeda Elohim</i> (and God took cognizance of them)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>va-yeda Elohim</i> means God pitied them.</i> (Ex. 2:25). However, I believe that this verse is to be explained as follows: I will go down and see if all of them (<i>kalah</i>) have done this evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>kalah</i> (altogether) is to be rendered as all, as in Ex. 11:1 (Krinsky). <i>Have done this evil</i> is a paraphrase of <i>according to the cry of it, which is come unto me</i>.</i> For in truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The reason that Scripture relates that God went down to see if they all did according to the cry that came before him.</i> God who is All knows the individual in a general rather than in a detailed manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra seems to be saying that “Ordinarily…God does not know the particular individual as such. He knows him only as implied in the whole” (Husik, p. 193). Thus it was necessary for God to <i>go down and see</i>. Nachmanides criticized Ibn Ezra on this point for introducing alien philosophical concepts into Judaism. Cf. Nachmanides’ commentary on the Pentateuch, on this verse. Other commentaries could not accept the literal implication of Ibn Ezra’s words and harmonized his comments to conform to traditional thinking. See Krinsky. Some argue that this comment did not come from I.E.’s hand but was inserted in the text by a misguided student.</i> Proof that this interpretation is correct, although it is a great mystery, is Abraham’s plea, <i>Wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked</i> (v. 23).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham asked God not to judge Sodom by his general knowledge but to look upon each of the city’s inhabitants as an individual.</i> The <i>heh</i> of <i>ha’af</i> (wilt) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">An interrogative <i>heh</i> is vocalized with a <i>chataf pattach</i>.</i> even though it is an interrogative <i>heh</i>, because it is followed by an <i>alef</i>, which is a guttural, and it is the rule in Hebrew to elongate the vowel before gutturals.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Hence an interrogative <i>heh</i> preceding the gutturals <i>alef, heh, chet, ayin</i> is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>, rather than with a <i>chataf pattach</i>.

Verse 22



Verse 23

THAT WILT SWEEP AWAY. <i>Tispeh</i> (thou wilt sweep away) is a transitive verb. It means is thou wilt destroy (or finish). <i>Aspeh</i> (finish) in <i>I will finish</i> (aspeh) <i>evils upon them</i> (Deut. 32:23) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I will spend (finish) all evil upon them.

Verse 24

AND NOT FORGIVE THE PLACE. <i>Tissa</i> means forgive. Compare, <i>nose</i> (forgiving) in <i>forgiving iniquity</i> (nose avon) (Ex. 34:7).
[THE PLACE.] Sodom. For it was on account of Sodom that Abraham approached God in prayer. He did so to save Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes issue with those who maintain that Abraham pleaded for the other cities as well.

Verse 25

Similarly, <i>for thou art even as Pharaoh</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ki kha-mokha ke-faroh</i> is to be understood as if written: for thou art even as Pharaoh, and Pharaoh is even as thou.</i> (Gen. 44:18); <i>my people as thy people</i> (I Kings 22:4);<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ke-ammi khe-ammekha</i>, which should be understood: my people as thy people, thy people as my people.</i> and <i>The darkness is even as the light</i> (Ps. 139:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ka-chashekhah ka-orah</i> : And the darkness is even as the light, and the light even as the darkness.</i> The thrust of Abraham’s appeal is: How is it possible for the Judge of all the earth to act unjustly?

Verse 26

Verse 27

[I HAVE TAKEN UPON ME.] <i>Ho’alti</i> (I have taken upon me) does not mean I began; it means I wanted. <i>Ho’il Moshe</i> (took Moses upon him) (Deut. 1:5) is similar. The <i>caf</i> of <i>anokhi</i> (I) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Anokhi</i>, meaning I, is a variant of <i>ani</i>.

Hence I.E. explains that dust and ashes refer to man’s bones, which are made out of earth (Krinsky). Cf. I.E.’s comment on Gen. 3:18.</i>

Verse 28

PERADVENTURE THERE SHALL LACK FIVE. Perhaps a tenth of the number will be lacking.
[WILT THOU DESTROY ALL THE CITY FOR LACK OF FIVE.] Will you destroy the city because of the five who are missing from the fifty?<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-chamishah</i> means because, i.e., because of five. I.E. makes this comment because <i>bet</i> usually means in.</i> Abraham then repeated his request and said, “Will you destroy the city if a ninth are missing from the number (forty-five) concerning which you stated that if there be found there that many righteous men I will not destroy them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">That is, if there are 40 righteous people in Sodom.</i> 

Verse 29

[I WILL NOT DO IT FOR THE FORTY’S SAKE.] <i>I will not do it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The text literally reads: I will not do for the sake of the 40.

I.E. points out that they mean the same thing.</i> means I will not bring destruction. And so as not to prolong his prayers Abraham combined the two previous subtractions.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">That is, from 50 to 45, from 45 to 40. Then Abraham asked if the Lord would destroy the city if 10 were missing from the number to which God had acceded. He no longer asked concerning five.</i> Thus Abraham asked if one quarter of the forty was missing would God destroy the city. He then asked if a third of the thirty were missing, would God destroy it. He concluded by asking if God would destroy the city if half of the twenty righteous men were missing. Some say that Abraham did not ask God to spare for less than ten people because there were five cities and thus less than two righteous per city. However, they are mistaken, for Scripture expressly tells us that Abraham spoke only of Sodom.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">According to Cherez and Krinsky. Cf. I.E.’s comment on verse 24. Perhaps we should render for God only promised with regard to Sodom as: <i>If I find in Sodom</i>, etc. (v. 26).

[WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT THEM FORTH.] <i>Ke-hotzi’am</i> (when they had brought) is an infinitive. <i>Ke-hotzi’am</i> should not be confused with <i>le-hotzi’am</i> (to bring them out), in <i>to bring them out</i> (le-hotzi’am) <i>of the land of Egypt</i> (Jer. 31:32), for in our verse the <i>mem</i> suffix stands for the subject, i.e., the angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">While in <i>le-hotzi’am</i> the <i>mem</i> suffix stands for the object.</i> The object of the sentence, Lot and his family, are indicated by the word <i>otam</i> (them).

OH, NOT SO MY LORD. <i>Adonai</i> (my lord) does not refer to God.

The meaning of our verse is as follows: When the angels told Lot, <i>escape to the mountain</i>, Lot replied, “Oh, not so my lords.” 

Verse 19

He then turned to one of the angels and said, <i>behold now, thy servant</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avdekha</i> (thy servant) is in the singular.

He did so because he considered this angel to be the more important of the two. The truth is that even among angels there are superiors who lord it over other angels. The <i>tav</i> of the root of <i>mavet</i> (death) is dropped in the word <i>va-matti</i> (and I die). The reason for this is that in the first person perfect a <i>tav</i> and a <i>yod</i> are added to the root.

Verse 30



Verse 31

AND THE FIRST-BORN SAID. Lot possibly had a wife who predeceased the wife who turned into a pillar of salt.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible mentions that Lot had married daughters (v. 14) in addition to the ones whom he had at home (v. 8). It is unlikely that any of the unmarried daughters was older than any one of the married ones. I.E. therefore concludes that the married daughters were from a wife other than the mother of the first-born mentioned in our verse. Since the “elder” (literally, the first-born) was younger than the married daughters, she was from the second wife. In view of that fact that Scripture refers only to one wife in the account of Lot’s fleeing from Sodom, I.E. assumes that Lot’s first wife was then no longer alive.</i> Lot’s daughters thought that the world was destroyed by fire and brimstone in the same manner that it had previously been destroyed by the flood.

The word <i>el</i> in <i>el Sarah</i> (of Sarah) should be rendered <i>al</i> (of, concerning).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>El</i> is usually rendered to. Thus our phrase would ordinarily be translated: And Abraham said to Sarah she is my sister. However, this makes no sense.

Some identify Sarah with Iscah, the daughter of Haran. I.E. rejects this identification. Cf. I.E.’s commentary on Gen. 11:29. Krinsky suggests that what I.E. means is that grandchildren are considered as children. Thus Sarah, the daughter of Haran, was considered Terah’s daughter and hence Abraham’s sister. Similarly Jacob is considered Abraham’s son.</i> However, I believe that Abraham put Abimelech off with a timely excuse.

Verse 13

WHEN GOD CAUSED ME TO WANDER. The word <i>Elohim</i> is to be rendered as God.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hitu</i> is the plural. Hence at first glance <i>Elohim</i> cannot refer to God since there is only one God. I.E. points out that even so, <i>Elohim</i> here refers to God.

Adler’s commentary on Onkelos, <i>Netivat Ha-Ger</i>, Israel, 1968.</i> The meaning of <i>hitu oti Elohim</i> (God caused me to wander) is that God made Abraham journey from place to place without Abraham knowing where he would go next. <i>To’eh</i> (wandering) in <i>and, behold he was wandering</i> (to’eh) <i>in the field</i> (Gen. 37:15) is similar. <i>Hitu</i> (caused me to wander) in our verse is not to be translated as caused me to err.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>to’eh</i> as err.

BEHOLD, IT IS FOR THEE A COVERING OF THE EYES. Some say that this alludes to the dimming of her son’s (Isaac’s) eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 27:1.</i> However, the latter is a Midrashic interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 15a; <i>Baba Kama</i> 93a), Abimelech cursed Sarah for deceiving him. The Talmud states, “Abimelech cursed Sarah and said, may your eyes be covered…The curse took effect on her seed as it is written, <i>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim</i>.”</i> I believe that the phrase <i>kesut enayim</i> (a covering of the eyes) is to be read as if written twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 2:8 and the note thereto. The verse should be read as follows: Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, he is for thee a covering of the eyes; and he is also a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. The Hebrew word <i>hu</i> can mean either he or it, Hebrew having no neuter term. I.E. translates the word <i>hu</i> in our verse as he and explains that it refers to Abraham.</i> It is similar to the word not (<i>al</i>) in <i>O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, and chasten me in Thy wrath</i> (Ps. 38:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The word not (<i>al</i>) in Ps. 38:2 is to be read as if written twice: O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, chasten me not in thy wrath.</i> There are many other such examples in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In which a word written once is to be read as if written twice.

What I.E. seems to be saying is that <i>covering of the eyes</i> refers to other men’s eyes, i.e., because of Abraham it is as if other men’s eyes are covered.</i> He is similarly a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee, namely, the handmaidens who are married to his servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">No one will molest any of the handmaidens; i.e., because of Abraham no one will dare lift up his eyes to Sarah or her handmaidens (Filwarg).

If the <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-nokhachat</i> were a connective <i>vav</i>, the phrase would read: and after all this and she was chastened, a very awkward construction.</i> Others explain that <i>behold, it is for thee</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See note 27. According to this interpretation <i>a covering of the eyes</i> means a garment appealing to the eyes.</i> refers to money which Abimelech gave for the purchase of a garment, and it is the word <i>natati</i> (I have given) that is to be read as if written twice. The verse is to be interpreted as follows: Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver to buy thee a covering (<i>kesut</i>), meaning a garment, that is appealing to the eye (<i>enayim</i>) and I have also given gifts to all that are with thee, and I have also given Abraham sheep, cattle, man and maidservants.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This is implied in <i>ve-et kol</i> (and all).

It should be noted that this third <i>natati</i> is implied in <i>ve-et kol</i> and does not pertain to the <i>natati</i> which is to be taken as if written twice.</i> However, my above quoted interpretation is better. It means that Abraham is a covering of the eyes to thee, before the servants that you had prior to coming here and before the servants that I have given you. class="footnote">According to I.E. the root of <i>ve-nokhachat</i> is <i>yod, caf, chet</i>, meaning to chasten, show (Weiser).

However, the presence of the phrase <i>all the wombs</i> (v. 18) clearly refutes their interpretation.

A WITNESS. <i>Le-edah</i> means a witness.

An oath is somehow connected to this mystery. It is for this reason that Abraham took seven ewe lambs (Weiser).

Verse 1

THAT GOD DID PROVE ABRAHAM. Some say that the word <i>nissah</i> (did prove, tested) is a variation of <i>nissa</i> (lifted up),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The problem which some commentators found in a literal translation of <i>nissah</i> as prove is that it seemed to imply that God did not know what Abraham’s response to his request would be. They thus interpreted <i>nissa</i> as coming from <i>nun, sin, alef</i>, meaning lifted up; i.e., God exalted Abraham by showing him to be a paragon of absolute obedience to the Lord’s will. Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 80:55.</i> with the <i>sin</i> replacing the <i>samekh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nissah</i> is spelled <i>nun, samekh, heh</i> ; <i>nassah</i> is spelled <i>nun, sin, alef</i>.</i> and the <i>heh</i> replacing the <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i> in <i>nissah</i>, like the <i>alef</i> in <i>nasa</i>, is silent.</i> However, the plain meaning of the entire chapter contradicts this interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The chapter deals with a test, a trial. Hence <i>nissah</i> means proved, tested, not exalted.</i> The word <i>nissah</i> is thus to be taken literally. The philosophers teach that there are two kinds of knowledge, knowledge of events prior to their occurrence, and knowledge of what is presently in existence. The latter is the meaning of <i>God did prove,</i> and <i>for now I know</i> (v. 12).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God knew (now I know) what Abraham would do if tested. However, until Abraham offered Isaac, God’s knowledge was knowledge of the potential or possible. He tested Abraham (did prove) to actualize His knowledge (Krinsky). He now knew what Abraham did, not only what Abraham would do.</i> Saadiah Gaon says that <i>did prove</i> means that God tested Abraham in order to demonstrate his piety to mankind; furthermore, he interprets <i>for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man</i> (v. 12) to mean that now I have made known to all that thou art a God-fearing man. But didn’t Saadiah know that even Abraham’s young men were not present when he bound Isaac and placed him on the altar?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. verse 5. In other words, no one was there to witness his act.</i> Others say that <i>and offer him there for a burnt offering</i> is to be interpreted as: bring him up to the mountain; this will be considered as if you brought him up as a burnt offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The word translated as offer him { <i>ve-ha’alehu</i>) literally means bring him up.</i> However, Abraham did not understand his prophetic vision<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He thought that God actually wanted him to offer his son as a burnt offering.</i> and hurried to sacrifice Isaac. God then told him, “I did not ask you to slay Isaac.”Still others say that God told Abraham: act as if you were bringing him up as a burnt offering. We find a similar occurrence in connection with the prophet Jeremiah, who was commanded to <i>Go unto the house of the Rechabites…and give them wine to drink</i> (Jer. 35:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Rechabites were foresworn by Rechab from drinking wine (Jer., Chap. 35). When God told Jeremiah, <i>and give them wine to drink</i> he did not intend that Jeremiah actually make them drink. Similarly God’s intention was not that Abraham actually sacrifice Isaac. He wanted Abraham to make all the preparations necessary for the sacrifice, i.e., to bind Isaac, lay him on the altar, etc. He was to do everything as if he were offering him as a sacrifice.</i> Now these geonim offered the above interpretations because they held that it is not possible that God would issue a command and then take it back.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God is unchangeable; hence his mind, too, is unchangeable. Therefore they offered the latter two interpretations.</i> However, they overlooked the fact that God took the firstborn to serve Him and after a year replaced them with the Levites.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The first-born were at first sanctified to God to minister before him (Ex. 13:2). However, the next year the Levites took their place. Cf. Num. 3:40-44.</i> In reality all questions are removed by Scripture’s first stating <i>that God did prove Abraham</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">God did not change His mind. He never intended for Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.</i> The reason God tested Abraham was in order to reward him.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For his willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to His will. I.E. now backsteps and explains why God, who is all-knowing, tested Abraham. He had earlier insisted that “prove” is to be taken literally. He now explains why. He similarly alludes to the meaning of <i>for now I know</i>.</i> 
The meaning of <i>for now I know that</i> (v. 12) is the same as <i>and if not, I will know</i> (Gen. 18:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 18:21.</i> I will also explain, if God who knows all hidden things will help me, the secret meaning of this term in my comments on <i>I know thee by name</i> (Ex. 33:12).

Verse 2

UPON ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS. The temple was later built on this mountain. This is explicitly stated in Scripture: <i>So Solomon built the house on Mount Moriah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I Kings 6:14 and II Chron. 3:1. The verse quoted by I.E. does not appear anywhere in the Bible. It is a composite of these two verses.</i> It was not a very tall mountain. The threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite was on it.

Verse 3

AND HE CLEAVED THE WOOD FOR THE BURNT-OFFERING. And placed them on his ass.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. derives this from Scripture’s stating that after Abraham left his young men with the ass (v. 5), he placed the wood on Isaac (v. 6). This implies that until then the wood was on the ass (Weiser).</i>

Verse 4

ON THE THIRD DAY. That he set out from Beersheba. 

Verse 5

Some ask, how could Abraham say, <i>and (we will) come back to you</i> (v. 5)?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">When he knew that only he would return. He should have said, “and I will return.”</i> Others answer them by saying that Abraham intended to return with Isaac’s bones, and he disguised his intentions so that his young men would wait for him till he returned and Isaac would not know what was about to happen and flee.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A prophet may tell an untruth if necessary. See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 20:12; 27:19.</i> Our sages, of blessed memory, say that Isaac was thirty-seven years old at the time of his binding.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 56:11.</i> If this be a tradition, we will accept it. However, from a strictly logical point of view it is unacceptable. If Isaac was an adult at this time, then his piety should have been revealed in Scripture and his reward should be double that of his father for willingly having submitted himself to be sacrificed. Yet Scripture says nothing concerning Isaac’s great self-sacrifice. Others say that Isaac was five years old at the time of his binding. This, too, is unacceptable, since Isaac carried the wood for the sacrificial pyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A child of five would be unable to carry that much wood.</i> It thus appears logical to assume that Isaac was close to thirteen years old and that Abraham overpowered him and bound him against his will. Proof of this can be seen from the fact that Abraham hid his intention from Isaac and told him, <i>God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son</i> (v. 8). Abraham knew that if he said, “You are to be the burnt-offering,” Isaac would quite possibly have fled.

Verse 13

BEHIND HIM A RAM CAUGHT IN THE THICKET. Abraham beheld a ram after (<i>achar</i>) it had been caught in the thicket by its horns.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads: <i>achar ne’achaz</i>. This is ungrammatical. I.E. suggests that it be interpreted as if written, <i>achar she-ne’echaz</i> (after it had been caught). J.P.S. renders <i>achar</i> (after) as behind him.</i> If the <i>chet</i> of <i>ne’echaz</i> (caught) is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>, then the word “was” is missing from the text and the meaning of the phrase is, after it was yet caught in the thicket.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In our texts the word <i>ne’echaz</i> (caught) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>. When <i>ne’echaz</i> is so vocalized it is a third person perfect, meaning it was caught. However, there are texts in which <i>ne’echaz</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>. In this instance <i>ne’echaz</i> is a participle, meaning it is caught. If this be the case, then the word “was” has to be inserted in the text to make sense out of the verse, as “was” followed by a participle is proper Hebrew.</i> There are many other similar instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">“Was” followed by a participle indicates a continuous action. Compare, in Rabbinic literature, <i>hu hayah omer</i> { <i>Aboth</i> 1:2), literally translated, he was saying; i.e., he used to say.</i> Others say that <i>achar</i> is connected to <i>And Abraham lifted up his eyes</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of our verse being: and Abraham lifted up his eyes after this and saw a ram caught in the thicket by its horns. Until now I.E. explains <i>achar</i> (after) as being connected to caught. This new interpretation suggests that <i>achar</i> concludes the first clause in our verse. This is the opinion of Rashi and Onkelos. According to them our verse reads: And Abraham lifted up his eyes after this.</i> But if this were so, the word <i>achar</i> would have been followed by <i>ken</i> or <i>zot</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 and Filwarg. Our text is probably corrupt. The word <i>achar</i> is always in the construct. When <i>achar</i> is not in the construct it is written, <i>achar ken</i> or <i>achar zot</i>. Hence our verse should read <i>achar ken</i>. Since it does not, <i>achar</i> cannot be connected to the preceding clause but rather to what follows.</i> as is the case whenever the word <i>achar</i> (after) indicates a pause.

Verse 1

THE LIFE OF. The word life (<i>chayyim</i>) is always encountered in the plural. We never find it in the singular. [A HUNDRED AND SEVEN AND TWENTY YEARS.] Hebrew usually first lists the larger numbers and then the smaller ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1 literally reads, <i>And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty and seven years</i>.</i> But we also find the opposite, an example being Scripture’s enumeration of Jacob’s years<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 47:28 literally reads, <i>So the days of Jacob, the years of his life were seven years and forty and a hundred years</i>.

Verse 3

BEFORE HIS DEAD. This alludes to the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">His dead (<i>meto</i>) is in the masculine. However, Sarah was a woman.

Verse 4

MY LORD. Not our lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture states, <i>And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying…Hear us, my lord</i>.

SHALL WITHHOLD. <i>Yikhleh</i> means shall withhold.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>caf, lamed, heh</i> means to finish (see Gen. 2:1). The root <i>caf, lamed, alef</i> means to withhold (see Gen. 8:2; Ps. 40:12). <i>Yikhleh</i> is spelled with a <i>heh</i> in our verse.

The word <i>male</i> means full. The opposite of full is empty (<i>rek</i>). I.E. points out that in our case this does not apply. One cannot say, <i>kesef rek</i> (empty money). However, one can say, <i>chaser kesef</i> (money is lacking). Hence <i>male</i> in our verse means the full amount and it is the opposite of <i>chaser</i>, rather than of <i>rek</i> (Filwarg).

Verse 14

SHE THAT THOU HAST APPOINTED. The servant relied on the efficacy of the prophet’s<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham.</i> prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thou hast appointed</i> implies that God had already chosen a bride for Isaac. How did the servant know this? I.E. suggests that the servant believed that God had accepted Abraham’s prayer (Krinsky). Or I.E.’s point is that the servant did not set up a test to see if the Lord set aside a damsel for Isaac. He trusted that God had because he relied on Abraham’s prayer (Filwarg). Throughout this section I.E. refers to the servant as “the servant.” He apparently was uncertain as to whether to identify him with Eliezer, as the Midrash and other medieval commentators did.</i> He was certain that God accepted it and sent an angel, the latter being God’s very own messenger, to help him by appointing a damsel in a dream.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s comment is vague. Weiser suggests that an angel appeared to Rebekah and directed (appointed) her to go out to the well. According to Krinsky the angel appeared to Rebekah’s family in a dream and told them to appoint a damsel for Isaac.</i> The servant reasoned that there was no family as charitable as his master’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Hence a girl saying, <i>Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also</i> would most probably be of Abraham’s family (Krinsky).</i> Many are perplexed <sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Taanit</i> 4a.</i> because they say that the servant expressed his request improperly.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In other words they claim that the servant selected an improper omen as proof of God’s choice. “What would the servant have done if a lame or a blind girl would have offered to give him and his flocks water? What would he have done if she was not of Abraham’s family and kindred” (<i>Taanit</i> 4a)?</i> I, however, do not see anything wrong in what he said, for had it been another damsel, one not of Abraham’s family, who offered to give him drink and water his camels, he would have left her and nothing would have been lost, for the verse <i>and said; Whose daughter art thou</i> means he had previously said, before he gave the ring and bracelets to Rebekah, <i>whose daughter art thou</i> ?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 22 and 23 state that the servant first gave Rebekah a golden ring and two bracelets and then said, <i>Whose daughter art thou</i> ? This implies that he took Rebekah for Isaac before he knew who she was. This contradicts what I.E. has just said, hence his interpretation.</i> Scripture similarly states, <i>And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she said: The daughter of Bethuel…And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands</i> (v. 47). The sum of the matter is the servant prayed that God would appoint for Isaac a young lady from the family of his master, the sign of God’s choice being that the damsel would act graciously as a woman of noble character should.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Cant. 7:2 (<i>bat nadiv</i>).</i> God heard his prayer. However, the case of Jonathan is totally different.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that the servant did not really set up a test to determine God’s will. He merely offered a prayer that God send him what he was looking for. His choice was not dependent on what the girl would do. If she acted in a certain way then he would investigate further. However, Jonathan set up a test. If such and such would happen he would act thus; if it did not, he would act differently. Jonathan’s test related to his attacking the Philistines. Jonathan said, <i>If they say thus unto us: Tarry until we come unto you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. But if they say thus: Come up unto us; then we will go up; for the Lord hath delivered them unto our hand; and this shall be the sign unto us</i> (I Sam. 14:9, 10).</i>

Verse 1

KETURAH. Keturah is not to be identified with Hagar<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 61:4; also Rashi’s comments.</i> because Scripture explicitly states, <i>But unto the sons of the concubines</i> (pilagshim), <i>that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts</i> (v. 6).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">“Concubines” indicates that Abraham had more than one concubine. If Keturah and Hagar were one and the same person the verse would have read concubine. I.E. goes on to note that <i>pilegesh</i> (concubine) refers exclusively to a handmaid to forestall the argument that verse 6 refers to male slaves (<i>pilagshim</i> has a masculine ending) and therefore negate his argument that Abraham had more than one concubine.</i> The meaning of <i>pilegesh</i> (concubine) is a handmaid. This term cannot refer to a male. We can explain <i>upon concubinage</i> (Ezek. 23:20) as referring to females.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The printed editions have, “We can explain on concubines as women.” If we accept this reading the point that I.E. is apparently making is that even though the word <i>pilagshim</i> has a masculine ending it refers to females (Weiser). However, Filwarg and Krinsky, as well as Weiser himself, point out that I.E. may be alluding to Ezek. 23:20, <i>And she doted on concubinage</i> (pilagshehem) <i>with them, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses</i>. The words <i>be-saram</i> (whose flesh) and <i>zirmatam</i> (whose issue) are masculine; hence the concubines spoken of in this verse appear to be males. Indeed, Kimchi in his comments on Ezek. 23:20 quotes an opinion which maintains that the concubines referred to in this verse are male slaves. Therefore I.E. points out that <i>pilagshim</i> refers only to females. Filwarg suggests amending our texts of I.E. to read <i>pilagshehem</i>, as in Ezek. 23:20. In this case the allusion to Ezekiel would be unmistakable. The fact of the matter is that <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads <i>al pilagshehem</i>, and we have translated accordingly.</i>

East means east of the land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Eastward refers to the entire eastern compass point, be it northeast or southeast (Weiser). According to this interpretation <i>unto the east country</i> is an explanation of <i>eastward</i> in the same way that <i>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</i> is an explanation of <i>him</i>.</i> Others say that <i>kedemah</i> (eastward) means to the place where the son of Ishmael dwelt.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This explanation is that <i>kedemah</i> means to Kedemah. Kedemah was a son of Ishmael (v. 15). According to this interpretation the verse is not redundant in stating <i>unto the east country</i>, for it is telling us where Kedemah dwelt.</i> The first of these two interpretations is the correct one.

Verse 7



Verse 8

[AND ABRAHAM EXPIRED.] Expired refers to a death wherein the soul leaves the body in a moment, without pain or delay. Proof of this is <i>he (Jacob) gathered up his feet unto the bed</i> and then immediately expired (Gen. 49:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that <i>gava</i> refers to a quick and painless death.</i> Every expiration (<i>gevi’ah</i>) is a death, but not every death is an expiration (<i>gevi’ah</i>). Hence Scripture states, with regard to those who perished in the flood, <i>And all flesh expired</i> (Gen. 7:21). <sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., Gen. 7:12 teaches that the flood killed swiftly (Weiser).</i> 
The meaning of, <i>and (Abraham) died</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">There was no need to state “and Abraham died” after stating “and he expired,” since expired means he died quickly.</i> is that he died at a ripe old age.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And Abraham died</i> is not redundant since it is not connected to expired but to what follows, i.e., <i>and Abraham died in a good old age</i> (Filwarg).</i>
AND WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE. Some say that this refers to the soul of life which, even while functioning<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. uses the term <i>kevod ha-nefesh</i> literally, the glory of life. The “glory” refers to man’s soul which gives life to the body.</i> in the body, is a separate entity. When it separates from the body it returns to its source.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. man’s soul is derived from a universal soul. While in the body the soul does not share the former’s corporeal properties. It has its own existence and can function independently of the body. It is thus a “separate entity” (Levine, p. 13).</i> Others say that <i>and was gathered to his people</i> is a mere idiom.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation there is no philosophical implication in the verse.</i> One who follows in the footsteps of his ancestors is said, as it were, to be joining them. <i>But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace</i> (Gen. 15:15) is similar.

Or it refers to the fact that most of the Ishmaelites journeyed from place to place. In this case <i>nafal</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it means passed over.</i> is like <i>nofel</i> in <i>Thou fallest away</i> (nofel) <i>to the Chaldeans</i> (Jer. 37:13).

Verse 19

AND THESE. After recording the generations of Ishmael, Scripture returns to record the progeny of Isaac, Esau and Jacob.

AND ISAAC ENTREATED. <i>Va-yetar</i> (entreated) is in the <i>kal</i>. However, <i>hatiru</i> (entreat) in <i>Entreat the Lord</i> (Ex. 8:4) is in the <i>hifil</i>.

Krinsky tries to justify this reading by maintaining that I.E. explains why entreat is here in the <i>kal</i> and in Ex. 8:4 in the <i>hifil</i>. It is here in the <i>kal</i> because God wanted their prayers. However, He really did not want to hear prayers on behalf of Pharaoh, hence the <i>hifil</i> form in Exodus. The latter being in the causative form implies that Moses burdened God with his prayers on behalf of Pharaoh. Krinsky also suggests that the text be read: he appeased God (vocalizing <i>ritzah</i> rather than <i>ratzah</i>) with their prayers, that is, with Isaac and Rebekah’s prayers. This is a bit forced. <i>Vat. Ebr.’s</i> reading is superior and has been followed.</i>
AND THE LORD LET HIMSELF BE ENTREATED. <i>Va-ye’ater</i> means and He was appeased. It is a <i>nifal</i>.

Verse 22

AND THE CHILDREN STRUGGLED TOGETHER. <i>Va-yitrotzatzu</i> (and they struggled) comes from the word that means running.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The root of run is <i>rash, vav, tzadi</i>.

TWINS. The root letter <i>alef</i> is missing in the word <i>tomim</i> (twins). <i>Tomim</i> in this regard is like the word <i>sheritikha</i> (release thee)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This is the J.P.S. translation. I.E. renders it your remnant. <i>She’erit</i> is usually spelled with an <i>alef</i>, which is missing in our verse.

[LIKE A MANTLE.] <i>Ke-adderet</i> (like a mantle) is not in the construct with <i>se’ar</i> (hairy).<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the text is not to be interpreted as <i>kullo ke-adderet se’ar</i> (all over like a hairy mantle) but as <i>kullo se’ar ke-adderet</i> (all over hairy; like a mantle). In other words, <i>kullo</i> (all over) refers to <i>se’ar</i> (hairy) even though the word <i>ke-adderet</i> (like a mantle) separates the two (Krinsky).</i> The verse is to be read as follows: all over hairy, like a mantle. However, others say that <i>ke-adderet</i> is in the construct with <i>se’ar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In this case the verse reads: all over like a mantle of hair.</i>
AND THEY CALLED HIS NAME. Those who saw him called him thus.

Filwarg explains that Esau’s birth was a unique event (<i>ma’aseh</i>) in that unlike all other children he was born hairy.</i> This birth was extremely wondrous. Every human being leaves the womb in a placenta which covers him.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Jacob and Esau were each in a separate placenta.

Verse 27

A CUNNING HUNTER. Esau was constantly practicing deception, for most animals are trapped through trickery.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture’s purpose in telling us at this point that Esau was a hunter is to inform us that Esau was a cunning and deceptive individual (Weiser).</i> Jacob was his antithesis, because he was a man of integrity.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew <i>ish tam</i> is translated by J.P.S. as <i>a quiet man</i>.

It is possible that the meaning of <i>dwelling in tents</i> is like <i>dwell in tents and have cattle</i> (Gen. 4:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">It does not meant that Jacob was a homebody, but that he was a keeper of herds and flocks.

Verse 29

AND HE WAS FAINT. <i>Ayef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ayef</i> (faint) may imply faint from exertion or faint from lack of food or water.

Verse 31

SELL ME. <i>Mikhrah</i> (sell me) is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mikhrah</i> (sell me) is an elongated imperative, the usual imperative of sell being <i>mekhor</i>. The rule in Hebrew grammar is that when a word in the <i>kal</i> follows the <i>efol</i>, vocalization of its elongated imperative is written with a <i>kamatz katan</i>, i.e., <i>zekhor</i> (remember) is elongated like <i>zokhrah</i> (Neh. 5:19), and <i>shemor</i> (keep) to <i>shomrah</i> (Ps. 25:20). Hence <i>mekhor</i> should become <i>mokhrah</i>. I.E. points out that even though <i>mekhor</i> follows the <i>efol</i> conjugation, it is elongated as an <i>efal</i>. In the latter, the elongated imperative is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> (Cherez).</i> like <i>shilchah</i> (send) in <i>Send</i> (shilchah) <i>the lad</i> (Gen. 43:8) and <i>shikhvah</i> (lie) in <i>Lie</i> (shikhvah) <i>with me</i> (Gen. 39:7.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">These words are conjugated in the <i>efal</i> and are thus vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> in the elongated imperative.</i> The birthright refers to the double share of the father’s wealth which belongs to the first born.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

I.E. offers this interpretation either because he believes that Isaac was poor at this time and the double share was insignificant, or because the law of the double share of the first-born took effect only after the revelation at Sinai.</i>

Verse 32

[BEHOLD, I AM AT THE POINT TO DIE.] He was daily exposed to danger when he went out hunting, as an animal might kill him. Thus there was a possibility that he would predecease his father.

SO ESAU DESPISED. Esau also despised the birthright<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The opening line of I.E. is difficult to comprehend. It literally reads: also this birthright because… Weiser, Filwarg, and Krinsky suggest that the text is corrupt. We have followed Filwarg’s reconstruction since it involves adding only one letter, viz., emending <i>gam zot</i> (also this birthright) to <i>gam baz et</i> (he also despised the birthright). The point is that in addition to selling the birthright because he was weary, he also despised the birthright because his father had no wealth to leave him (Weiser).</i> because he saw that his father had no wealth. Many are amazed at this because Abraham left Isaac a vast amount of money?”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 24:34, 37.</i> Have they never seen a man very rich in his youth and poor in his old age? Proof that Isaac was poor is the fact that he loved Esau because of his need.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. verse 28.

Furthermore, why did Isaac have to tell Esau, <i>Bring me venison</i> (Gen. 27:7), if he had savory meat at home for his daily meals? Additionally, why did Jacob not have choice garments <sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 27:15.</i> and why didn’t Rebekah give Jacob gold and silver for his journey (when he fled to Haran), seeing that Jacob was so poor that he had to say, <i>“If God will…give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on”</i> (Gen. 28:20). Also, why did Rebekah, who loved him so much, not send him money in view of the fact that he was so impoverished that he had to tend Laban’s flock? As to the verse which states, <i>And the man waxed great…And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household</i> (Gen. 26:13, 14), it refers to the period prior to Isaac’s old age. Now, those who are intellectually blind think that wealth is a great distinction for the righteous. However, the prophet Elijah shows that the opposite is the case.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 17:6, where Elijah’s poverty is described.</i> They further ask, why did God withhold wealth from Isaac?

Additional Midrashic reasons for Isaac’s blindness are quoted by Krinsky in his comments on Gen. 27:1.</i> for there is a secret meaning in the matter<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Either for Isaac’s blindness (Weiser, Krinsky) or to the Midrash (Filwarg).</i> and we must not probe into it, for the thoughts of God are deep and beyond the ken of man.

AND KEPT MY CHARGE. <i>Mishmarti</i> (my charge) is a general term for all that Abraham was obligated to observe from the commandments (<i>mitzvot</i>), statutes (<i>chukkim</i>) and laws (<i>torot</i>). It is possible that the commandments spoken of in our verse refer to <i>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred</i> etc. (Gen. 12:1), and <i>Take now thy son…even Isaac…and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains</i> etc. (Gen. 22:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains that <i>My commandments</i> refers to Gen. 12:1 and Gen. 22:2, as these were commandments. <i>Statutes</i> pertain to Abraham’s emulating God’s ways and laws. It should be noted that I.E. explains <i>chok</i> to mean a logical law. This is in contradistinction to Rashi, who explains <i>chukkim</i> as irrational laws. I.E seems to imply that Abraham did not observe all the laws, statutes and commandments contained in the Torah. This is contrary to the Rabbinic sage Rav, who held that Abraham observed the entire Torah, as seen from the verse <i>because that Abraham hearkened to My voice, and kept My charge</i> etc. (<i>Yoma</i> 28b).</i> 
The statutes spoken of in our text pertain to the works of God that a man should uphold.

The <i>torot</i> (laws) mentioned in our verse relate to Abraham’s circumcision of himself, his children and his servants.

See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 20:13. <i>Le-ishto</i> might be rendered to his wife, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> We find a similar meaning for this word in <i>that men say not of me</i> (li) (Jud. 9:54).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Here too the <i>lamed</i> means about. Thus <i>li</i> should be rendered about me, not to me.</i>
FOR HE FEARED. <i>Yare</i> (he feared) is a perfect,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yare</i> can also be a participle, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> as is the word <i>zaken</i> (old) in <i>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old</i> (zaken) (Gen. 27:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zaken</i> can also be a participle. However, in this verse it cannot be so, for the verse opens with a perfect viz., <i>va-yehi</i> (and it came to pass).</i> The words “because he said” have been omitted before <i>lest the men of the place should kill me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads: <i>for he feared to say ‘My wife:’ lest the men of the place should kill me</i>. According to I.E. this is an abridged verse and should be read as if written: for he feared to say my wife, “because he said” lest the men of this place, etc.</i> We find this phrase similarly omitted in <i>for God hath made me fruitful</i> (Gen. 41:52).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It should be read: “because he said” for God hath made me fruitful.</i>

Verse 12

A HUNDREDFOLD. The word <i>sha’ar</i> means the same as the Rabbinic term <i>shi’ur</i> (estimate, reckon). The meaning of <i>me’ah she’arim</i> (a hundredfold) is that Isaac was blessed in that the earth produced one hundred times more than what he sowed was estimated to produce. The word <i>she’arim</i> comes from the same root as <i>sha’ar</i> in <i>For as one that hath reckoned</i> (sha’ar) <i>within himself</i> (Prov. 23:7).

Verse 13

AND GREW. <i>Ve-gadel</i> (and grew) is a perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The word grew is written twice in the second part of the sentence. The first time it is written <i>gadel</i>, the second time <i>gadal</i>. Hence I.E. points out that both are perfects and mean the same. I.E.’s comment is pertinent because <i>gadel</i> can also be a participle (Krinsky, Weiser).</i>

Verse 14

AND A GREAT HOUSEHOLD. Isaac had man and maidservants to serve him. <i>Avuddah</i> (household) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>avuddah</i> is an adjective, with the noun which it is modifying missing. Scripture should have read: <i>adamah avuddah</i>, ground worked by man and maidservants (Cherez, Weiser). I.E. interprets thus because the form <i>avuddah</i> looks like an adjective.</i> On the other hand, it may be a noun following the paradigm of <i>segullah</i> (treasure).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A collective noun, following the paradigm of <i>segullah</i>, or <i>kedushah</i>, the point being we find nouns with this vocalization. Hence <i>avuddah</i> does not have to be an adjective. In this case the meaning of <i>avuddah</i> is simply servants, both male and female.</i>

These two forms were employed by Scripture to avoid redundancy (Weiser). According to Filwarg what I.E. is saying is that one of these phrases could have been left out since they mean the same; i.e., <i>benotenu</i> (betwixt us) means the same as <i>benenu u-venekha</i> (even betwixt us and thee) Scripture repeated itself for emphasis.</i>

BEER-SHEBA.

Scripture then adds, <i>Wherefore that place was called Beer-Sheba because there they swore both of them</i>. However, here we are told that Beersheba was so called because of the oath (<i>shevu’ah</i>) taken by Isaac and Abimelech (cf. Rashi). I.E. points out that Beersheba was so called because of the oaths taken by Abraham and Isaac. Or possibly the two reasons for the name are: Abraham’s setting aside the seven (<i>shevah</i>) lambs and his oath (<i>shevu’ah</i>). Isaac merely repeated Abraham’s oath (Weiser). Or Abraham called the place Beersheba because of the setting aside of the seven lambs and Isaac called it thus because of the oath (Cherez).</i> On the other hand, it is possible that this Beersheba is not to be identified with the Beersheba previously mentioned (Gen. 21:28-31).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This would explain the two accounts for the name Beersheba in Scripture.

BASEMATH. Basemath is to be identified with Adah.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse we read, <i>Basemath, the daughter of Elon, the Hittite</i>.

A BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT. Each one of Esau’s wives<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And they were</i> is in the plural; <i>morat</i> is a singular. Scripture should have used the plural <i>morot</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> was a <i>morat ru’ach</i> (bitterness of spirit) to Isaac and Rebekah. Some say that <i>morat</i> (bitterness) is similar to the word <i>moreh</i> (rebellious) in <i>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious</i> (moreh) <i>son</i> (Deut. 21:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the verse reads: and each one of them was rebellious (<i>morat</i>) against the wishes of (<i>ru’ach</i>) Isaac and Rebekah.</i> However, I believe that <i>morat</i> comes from the same root as <i>marah</i> (bitter) in <i>bitter (marah) as wormwood</i> (Prov. 5:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>morat</i> is not a verb meaning rebellious but a noun meaning bitter. The meaning of <i>morat ru’ach</i> is: they were a bitterness of the spirit; i.e., Isaac and Rebekah were displeased with having Canaanite daughters-in-law. In this case one does not have to interpret <i>morat ru’ach</i> as each one was a <i>morat ru’ach</i>, because it can be interpreted as both were a bitterness of spirit. Thus there is no problem with <i>And they were</i> being in the plural and <i>morat ru’ach</i> in the singular (Krinsky).</i> Indeed, it is explicitly written, <i>and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew literally reads: were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father; that is, Isaac did not like them. In other words, they were a bitterness of spirit to him because they were Canaanites, not because they rebelled against him.</i> <i>Isaac, his father</i> (Gen. 28:8). The account of Esau’s wives was recorded so that the Israelites would keep themselves from taking Canaanite women.

THY WEAPONS. <i>Khelekha</i> (thy weapons) is possibly a general term, the particulars being <i>thy quiver and thy bow</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The verse should be understood as follows: take, I pray thee, thy weapons, namely thy quiver and thy bow.</i> <i>Telyekha</i> (thy quiver) is a sheath hanging<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>tav, lamed, heh</i> means to hang.</i> from its bearer wherein arrows are placed. On the other hand, <i>khelekha</i> may refer to a sword.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows the <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 text. The printed texts have <i>telyekha</i> referring to a sword. If this reading is accepted, why does I.E. say a <i>vav</i> should have been placed before <i>telyekha</i>? The first particular following a general term does not require a <i>vav</i>, as I.E. himself implies in his comment on Gen. 26:5. Furthermore, why should a <i>vav</i> be placed before <i>telyekha</i> if it means a sword and not if it means a quiver? For an attempt to explain the printed texts see Krinsky and Cherez. However, for the impossibility of the printed versions see Filwarg. The reading of <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 seems correct.</i> However, in this case a conjunctive <i>vav</i> should have been placed in front of <i>telyekha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture is listing three separate items, sword, quiver and bow, a conjunctive <i>vav</i> should be placed before quiver as it is before bow. The verse should read: take thy sword and thy quiver (<i>ve-telyekha</i>) and thy bow.</i> Nevertheless, it does not refute the latter interpretation, for we find a similar instance in <i>Adam, Seth, Enosh</i> (I Chron. 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Here, too, we find three separate individuals listed without a <i>vav</i> before the final two.

HAIRY. The word <i>sa’ir</i> means hairy. The opposite of <i>sa’ir</i> is <i>chalak</i> (smooth) (v. 11).

We thus find that King David, whom Scripture calls <i>the man of God</i> (II Chron. 8:14) and who said, <i>The spirit of the Lord spoke by me</i> (II Sam. 23:2), perverted the truth out of need of the hour when he spoke to Abimelech and said, <i>Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy</i> (I Sam. 21:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">When David asked for the holy bread, he had no young men with him.

I.E. points out that the <i>kere</i> is the correct meaning of the verse. Thus Elisha misled the king of Aram. He told him that he would live although he knew that he would be killed (Netter). For a description of the incident see II Kings 8:7-15.</i> Similarly the prophet Micaiah uttered a vain prayer out of deference to King Ahab when he told him, <i>Go up and prosper; and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king</i> (I Kings 22:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">King Ahab inquired of the prophet if he would succeed in his attempt to regain Ramoth-Gilead from Aram.

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS WHEN THOU SHALT BREAK LOOSE. <i>Tarid</i> (thou shalt break loose) has the same meaning as <i>tirdeh</i> (thou shalt rule) (Lev. 25:43).

Indeed, he said, <i>The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau</i> (v. 22). What Isaac did was bless the one in his presence without regard to whether it was Esau or Jacob, the reason being that both were his sons.

[GOD’S HOUSE.] The meaning of <i>shall be God’s House</i> is: it will be a fixed place for my prayers and for my tithing; for out of all the money <i>that thou shalt give me</i>, I will give a tithe out of respect for God to one who is fit to receive it.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Such as Melchizedek.

WRESTLINGS. <i>Naftule</i> (wrestlings) is a noun in the <i>nifal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It is a noun from the root <i>peh, tav, lamed</i> following a <i>nifal</i> paradigm. From this root we get the verb <i>niftalti</i> (I wrestled). The same is the case with the proper name Naphtali (Weiser). Krinsky and Cherez maintain that what I.E. means is that <i>naphtali</i> is an infinitive.</i> Its meaning is I strove, as a man who, when wrestling<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Naftulai</i> thus means twistings of (Weiser). I.E. uses twistings in a specific sense, twisting while fighting.</i> with another, twists (<i>yiftol</i>) in his effort to overpower his opponent in order to throw him to the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that Rachel did not actually wrestle with her sister. She strove with her with the determination of a person trying to overpower his opponent. However, the literal meaning of <i>naftule</i> is twistings (wrestlings).</i> The word <i>tittappal</i> (Thou dost deal tortuously) (II Sam. 22:27) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The point of the verse is that God deals with a person measure for measure, viz., <i>With the pure Thou dost show thyself pure, And with the twisted</i> (ikkesh) <i>Thou dost deal tortuously</i> (tittappal). In the latter verse <i>tittappal</i> (tortuously) is parallel to <i>ikkesh</i> (twisted). Hence <i>tittappal</i> implies crookedness or twisting. <i>Tittappal</i> is a variation of <i>titpattal</i> (Kimchi), and Ps. 18:27 which has the identical theme reads <i>titpattal</i>. Thus it seems that the root <i>peh, tav, lamed</i> and its variation <i>tav, peh, lamed</i> mean to twist (Weiser).</i> The reason Rachel mentioned God, (<i>naftule Elohim</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Naftule Elohim</i>, wrestlings of God.</i> is either that out of respect for the Lord she had given her handmaiden to her husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Naftule Elohim</i> (with mighty wrestlings) is to be rendered: Godly wrestlings.</i> or that God helped her in her struggle.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>naftule Elohim</i> means wrestlings with God’s help.</i>

Verse 11

FORTUNE IS COME. <i>Bagad</i> (fortune is come) is really two words<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It is a combination of two words <i>ba</i> (spelled <i>bet, alef</i>) and <i>gad</i> (Weiser).

The meaning of Gad is a troop.

MANDRAKES. Onkelos renders <i>dudaim yavruchin</i> (Aramaic for mandrakes). They are similarly called in Arabic. Mandrakes give off a pleasant scent.

Therefore I.E. points out that <i>ni</i> here does not have the meaning of <i>oti</i> (me) but <i>immi</i> (with me). Since the suffix <i>ni</i> means <i>oti</i> (me), it is usually combined only with a transitive verb, compare, <i>zevadani</i> (endowed me); <i>hikkani</i> (smite me), <i>yahargeni</i> (will kill me) and others (Weiser).</i> i.e., his dwelling (<i>zevulo</i>) will always be with me.

GOD HATH TAKEN AWAY MY REPROACH. <i>Asaf</i> (taken away) is to be rendered cut off. Compare, <i>And gladness and joy are taken away</i> (ve-ne’esaf) (Is. 16:10). Others interpret what Rachel said as, God saw the insults which the women hurled at me because I was barren and by giving me a son He, as it were, gathered (<i>asaf</i>) and collected the insults.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>asaf</i> means gathered rather than cut off.</i> It is clear from Scripture that Jacob’s twelve children were born in seven years.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Seder Olam</i> 2, “Jacob spent 20 years in Laban’s house. Seven before marrying the matriarchs, and seven after marrying them and six years after the birth of the eleven tribes and Dinah. We thus find that the tribes with the exception of Benjamin were born in seven years, each one every seven months.” That is, six months and some days (Weiser). The point is that Jacob had acquired eleven sons and Dinah by the time he had finished serving his 14 years for his wives (v. 25). The first seven years he had no wife (v. 20). Hence all his children, with the exception of Benjamin who was born after he had left Laban, were born during seven years.</i> When the ancients numbered them they could only explain how this was possible by saying that each was born six months and some days after conception.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells us that Jacob’s children were born in sequence; Reuben, Simon, Levi, etc. Since Jacob had twelve children in seven years, he had to have had a child every seven months since there are 84 months in seven years and 84 divided by 12 is 7. The reason I.E. says that Jacob’s sons were born six months and some days following conception is to allow for the days of “uncleanliness” following childbirth during which Jacob abstained from intercourse with those wives who conceived twice in one year (cf. <i>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chap. 36). The <i>Seder Olam</i> quoted above employs a round number (Cherez).</i> However, this was not necessarily so. It is posssible that Leah gave her handmaiden to Jacob before Naphtali was born, that Rachel conceived before the birth of Zebulun,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Zilpah could have conceived Gad while Bilhah was pregnant with Naphtali, and Rachel could have conceived before Zebulun was born. The fact that Scripture tells us that Leah gave Zilpah to Jacob after Naphtali was born does not mean that that was the sequence of events. Cf. Cherez and Weiser. The point is there is no reason to assume that Jacob’s children were born seven months apart.</i> and that we do not know when Dinah was born.

Nokvah</i> is an elongated form.</i> It follows the paradigm of <i>zokhrah</i> (remember) in <i>Remember</i> (zokhrah) <i>me, O my God, for good</i> (Neh. 13:31). The meaning of <i>nokvah</i> (appoint) is, clearly state, as we see from <i>Which the mouth of the Lord shall mark out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Or clearly state.</i> (yikkovennu) (Is. 62:2). The <i>dagesh</i> of <i>yikkovennu</i> (shall mark out) compensates for the missing <i>nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>nokvah</i> and <i>yikkovennu</i> have the same root, <i>nun, kof, bet</i> and mean the same, viz., clearly state.</i> We find the same with the word <i>yiddevennu</i> (make them willing) in <i>whose heart maketh him willing</i> (yiddevennu) (Ex. 25:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yiddevennu</i> has a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>dalet</i> to make up for the missing <i>nun</i>. Thus <i>yikkovennu</i> and <i>yiddevenu</i> are similar. Both have a <i>nun</i> as a first root letter and the <i>nun</i> drops out in the imperfect and is replaced by a <i>dagesh</i>.</i>

Verse 30

WITHERSOEVER I TURNED. <i>Le-ragli</i> (withersoever I turned) is to be rendered: because of my foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ragli</i> literally means my foot. The <i>lamed</i> prefixed to it is a causal <i>lamed</i>, in Hebrew, <i>lamed ha-sibbah</i> (Weiser).</i> It is the custom of people to say so and so has a good foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">So and so brings good fortune (Weiser).</i> What Jacob was saying was: you have been blessed ever since I came to your house. The <i>heh</i> of <i>me’umah</i> (aught in v. 31) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is penultimately accented.</i> The word is also found spelled without the <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mum</i> in Job 31:7.</i>

Verse 31



Verse 32

STREAKED.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The words upon which I.E. comments, i.e., <i>akuddim, nekuddim, beruddim</i> are found in Gen. 31:10. I.E. inserted it here because he wanted to clarify the type of marks that the Bible refers to before proceeding to comment on the account of Jacob’s hire.</i> The streak was on the animal’s foot. <i>Akuddim</i> (streaked) refers to a cord-like mark that bound the foot<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>ayin, kof, dalet</i> means to bind. <i>Akuddim</i> is a mark resembling a cord going around the foot of the animal at the place where it is normally bound. This is what I.E. means by “a mark that bound the foot.”</i>
SPECKLED. <i>Nekuddim</i> means speckled.
GRIZZLED. <i>Beruddim</i> (grizzled) comes from the same root as <i>barad</i> (hail). It means having white spots.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Like hail.</i>
[SPOTTED.] <i>Talu</i> is a general term for all type of spots.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">At various places in the body (Weiser).</i> It comes from the same root as <i>u-metulla’ot</i> (and clouted) in <i>and worn shoes and clouted</i> (u-metulla’ot) <i>upon their feet</i> (Josh. 9:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>tet, lamed, alef</i>.</i> The meaning of <i>u-metulla’ot</i> is marked.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The patches (clouts) marked the shoes. We thus see that <i>talu</i> is a general term for spotted.</i> The term <i>seh</i> (v. 32), refers to he-goats.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. this clause should be translated: removing from thence every speckled and spotted he-goat. I.E. explains that <i>seh</i> refers to he-goats because the sheep were not speckled and spotted but were <i>chum</i> (dark) and the she-goats are mentioned in the final part of the verse. Hence <i>seh</i> must refer to he-goats (Cherez).</i> It is similarly written <i>the sheep</i> (seh kevasim) <i>and the goat</i> (seh izim) (Deut. 14:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>seh</i> can thus apply to both goats and sheep. In the first part of our verse it applies to he-goats.</i> Now since <i>talu</i> (spotted) is a general term for all type of spots, the meaning of <i>every speckled and spotted</i> (talu) <i>one</i> is: every he-goat speckled, streaked and grizzled.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains that <i>nakod</i> means speckled and <i>talu</i> includes the other types of spots, i.e., a mark around the ankle, <i>akuddim</i> (streaked), and hail like spots, <i>beruddim</i>.</i>
AND EVERY DARK ONE AMONG THE SHEEP. <i>Chum</i> means black. It is possible that <i>chum</i> means black because it is affected by heat (<i>chom</i>), for a black object gets hotter than a white object.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">What I.E. probably means is that black objects absorb heat from the sun more than do white objects. This shows that heat causes blackness.</i>
AND THE SPOTTED AND SPECKLED AMONG THE GOATS. Streaked, grizzled and speckled.

Verse 33

EVERY ONE THAT IS NOT SPECKLED AND SPOTTED AMONG THE GOATS. Speckled, grizzled and streaked.
AMONG THE GOATS. He and she-goats.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since goats stand in contradistinction to sheep in our verse, it refers to all goats, both male and female.</i> 

Verse 34



Verse 35

AND HE REMOVED THAT DAY THE HE-GOATS THAT WERE STREAKED AND SPOTTED. Spotted (<i>telu’im</i>) means speckled and grizzled.
[AND ALL THE SHE-GOATS THAT WERE SPECKLED AND SPOTTED.] The interpretation of <i>telu’ot</i> (spotted) is streaked and grizzled.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Speckled is mentioned in the verse; hence <i>telu’ot</i> (spotted) refers to the other types of marks.</i> This is what Scripture means by <i>everyone that had white in it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The verse should be read as follows: speckled and spotted, that is, every one that had white in it (Weiser). The spots were white. “Every one that had white in it” explains speckled and spotted (Weiser).</i>
AND ALL THE DARK ONES AMONG THE SHEEP. The black sheep. <i>Chum</i> (dark, black) is an adjective similar to a <i>pa’ul</i>. It follows the paradigm of <i>sug</i> (dissembler) in <i>The dissembler</i> (sug) <i>in heart</i> (Prov. 14:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. calls it similar to <i>pa’ul</i> because only transitive verbs come in the <i>pa’ul. Chum</i> is intransitive. Nevertheless, it is similar to <i>pa’ul</i> in that it is an adjective. The same is true of <i>sug</i> (Cherez). Weiser translates: It is an adjective in the <i>pu’al</i>, following the paradigm of <i>sug</i>; that is, it is an <i>ayin, vav</i> in the <i>pu’al</i>.</i> A great grammarian explained the word <i>haser</i> (removing)<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Haser</i> can be either an infinitive or an imperative. The grammarian explained it as an infinitive because of the difficulty of coordinating <i>I will pass</i> with the imperative remove.</i> in <i>removing</i> (haser) <i>from thence</i> (v. 32) as an infinitive, meaning to remove. The meaning of the aforementioned verse according to this scholar is: I will pass through all thy flock today to remove from thence every…and that which I remove will be my hire.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of: and of such shall be my hire.</i> He further explained <i>And gave them into the hands of his sons</i> (v. 35) as referring to Jacob’s sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since according to this interpretation Jacob did the removing, he is the subject of verse 35 which reads: <i>And he removed</i>; and <i>his sons</i> refers to Jacob’s sons.</i> However, he said that <i>he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob</i> (v. 36) pertains to Laban.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This is obvious.</i> This comment is wrong in view of the fact that Jacob had no son older than Reuben, and he was not yet seven years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The events described in our passage took place after the close of Jacob’s 14 years of service to Laban. Reuben, his oldest, was then not yet seven years old. How, then, could Jacob give the sheep to his small children to keep?</i> This is the way our passage is to be explained: <i>haser</i> (v. 32) is, as its form indicates, an imperative meaning “remove” and the meaning of <i>and of such shall be my hire</i> (v. 32) is: such as these which you now remove will in the future be my hire.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 32 does not tell us that Jacob removed the sheep and kept them as his hire and then gave them to his children to keep (v. 35). Rather, it tells us that Jacob told Laban, “Remove the spotted…sheep and goats from your flock and keep them. However, in the future such as these shall be my hire.” Verse 35 tells us that Laban removed them and gave them to his (Laban’s sons) to keep.</i>
SO SHALL MY RIGHTEOUSNESS WITNESS AGAINST ME. My righteousness shall testify for me <i>before thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. connects <i>before thee</i> with <i>so shall my righteousness witness against me</i>, rather than with <i>my hire</i>, which precedes it (Krinsky, Cherez).</i> when you come and look over my hire, viz., the flock that I have separated for myself. If you find among the latter a he and she-goat that is not streaked, speckled and grizzled or a sheep that is not black, then it <i>shall be counted stolen</i>. Behold you have already removed from the flock all goats streaked, speckled and grizzled and all black sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Hence all such animals found with me must be mine.</i>
AND LABAN SAID: BEHOLD. <i>Hen</i> (behold) is identical in meaning to <i>hinneh</i>, the <i>heh</i> being superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. makes this comment because the usual term for behold in Scripture is <i>hinneh</i>.</i> It is similar in this regard to <i>ha-eleh</i> (these) and <i>ha-el</i> (these).<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 19:8. Both <i>ha-el</i> and <i>ha-eleh</i> mean the same, the <i>heh</i> being superfluous.</i>
AND HE REMOVED. Laban removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. makes this point because according to the grammarian quoted above, <i>And he removed</i> refers to Jacob.</i>

Verse 36

AND HE SET. Here, too, Scripture speaks of Laban.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">According to the grammarian quoted above, <i>And he removed</i> refers to Jacob and <i>And he set</i> refers to Laban. Hence I.E. points out that both refer to Laban.</i>

Verse 37

RODS OF. <i>Makkal</i> (rods of) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> because it is in the construct.
POPLAR…ALMOND…AND PLANE TREE. <i>Livneh</i> (poplar), <i>luz</i> (almond) and <i>armon</i> (plane tree) are names of trees. However, <i>lach</i> (fresh) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads, <i>livneh lach, ve-luz ve-armon</i>. Conceivably <i>lach</i> could be taken to be the name of a tree. Hence I.E. points out that <i>lach</i> is an adjective modifying <i>livneh</i>, i.e., fresh</i> Saadiah Gaon says that <i>luz</i> means almond since that is its meaning in Arabic, and Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic belong to the same family.
MAKING THE WHITE APPEAR. He peeled the bark. Compare, <i>The Lord hath made bare</i> (chasaf) <i>His holy arm</i> (Is. 52:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the root <i>chet, sin, peh</i> means to lay bare. Hence <i>machsof ha-lavan</i> means he laid bare the white (Weiser). He did this by peeling the bark. I.E. makes this point because the root <i>chet, sin, peh</i> can also mean to strip. Hence <i>machsof ha-laven</i> might be translated, stripping off the white.</i>

Verse 38

PEELED. The word <i>pitzel</i> (peeled) means he made small cuts.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The verb <i>pitzel</i> is found in Scripture only in verses 37 and 38. According to I.E. it does not exactly mean to peel. See S.D. Luzzato’s commentary on this verse.</i>
IN THE GUTTERS. Pools containing water for the sheep to drink from.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently interpreted <i>rehatim</i> (gutters) as being synonymous with <i>shikatot ha-mayim</i> (watering troughs) (Weiser).</i>
AND THEY CONCEIVED. <i>Va-yechamnah</i> (and they conceived) is a combination of masculine and feminine forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The feminine form third person plural is <i>va-techamnah</i>. The <i>yod</i> is a masculine prefix. Hence <i>va-yechamnah</i> combines the masculine (the <i>yod</i>) with the feminine.</i> We find the same in the word <i>va-yisharnah</i> (and took…the straight way) in <i>And the kine took the straightway</i> (va-yisharnah) (I Sam. 6:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The correct feminine form is <i>va-tisharnah</i>. See note 69. The feminine should have been used since <i>kine</i> is feminine.</i>

Verse 39

AND THE FLOCKS CONCEIVED. <i>Va-yechemu</i> means: and they conceived.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>yod, chet, mem</i>, meaning to be hot, that is, hot with sexual desire and by extension to conceive.</i> This word is irregularly vocalized because of the <i>chet</i> which is a guttural. It should have been vocalized as <i>va-yeshevu</i> (and they sat down) in <i>And they sat down</i> (va-yeshevu) <i>to eat bread</i> (Gen. 37:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the root of <i>va-yechemu</i> is <i>yod, chet, mem</i>. Being a <i>peh yod</i> it should follow that paradigm. Thus the <i>yod</i> should be vocalized with a <i>tzere</i> as the <i>yod</i> of <i>va-yeshev</i>. However, since the <i>chet</i> is a guttural and is vocalized with a <i>chataf segol</i>, the <i>yad</i> is vocalized with a <i>segol</i> (Cherez).</i> Don’t be surprised at Scripture’s use of the masculine<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yechemu</i>. Females conceive, hence Scripture should have stated <i>va-techamna hatzon</i> rather than <i>va-yechemu hatzon</i>.</i> when referring to female sheep. Hebrew is strict in differentiating between the masculine and feminine forms only in the singular and not in the plural.
AT THE SIGHT OF THE RODS. <i>El ha-maklot</i> should be rendered at the sight of the rod. Many are amazed at what is reported in our verse<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">That the sheep’s fetuses were influenced by what the sheep looked at.</i> and say that it can only be described as an out of the ordinary phenomenon. Really, what Scripture describes is indeed one of the wonders of nature. However, it is a natural law. Even a woman who is created in the image of the angels affects her fetus by what she looks at while she is pregnant.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. believed that it is a law that applies to all females. Hence what is described in our verse is not a supernatural phenomenon.</i>
AND SPOTTED. Grizzled. This is so because <i>telu’im</i> (spotted) is a general term for all types of spots.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>telu’im</i> is a general term for speckled, streaked and grizzled, and speckled and streaked are specifically mentioned in our verse, <i>telu’im</i> can only refer to grizzled (Krinsky). The Bible sometimes uses a general term for the particular (Weiser).</i>

Verse 40

AND JACOB SEPARATED THE LAMBS. Jacob also did one more thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to peeling the sticks and having the goats face them while coupling.</i> He separated the lambs and chose the streaked and the dark ones and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and dark ones so that they would produce similar offspring. This resulted in his having his own droves<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Cherez.</i> which he did not <i>put unto Laban’s flock</i>. Others say that Jacob separated the lambs from his own flock and that <i>and put his own droves apart</i> should have preceded <i>and Jacob separated the lambs</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The verse should be read as if written: And (Jacob) put his own droves apart and put them not unto Laban’s flock, and Jacob separated the lambs (from his own droves) and set the faces of the flocks (of Laban) toward the streaked and all the dark (of Jacob’s flock), he did this to all the flocks of Laban. It should be noted that according to this interpretation the meaning of <i>be-tzon lavan</i> (in the flock of Laban) is, he did this to all of Laban’s flock. See Filwarg and Cherez.</i>

Verse 41

WHENSOEVER THE STRONGER OF THE FLOCK DID CONCEIVE. In the month of Nisan,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Those born in the month of Nisan (Krinsky, Weiser).</i> so that all those born would be strong and healthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The sun is strong then and the sheep born in this month are healthier.</i>

Verse 42

BUT WHEN THE FLOCK WERE FEEBLE. In the month of Tishri.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Born in Tishri.</i> Jacob did this so that Laban would not know that he was employing the sticks to produce spotted goats.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Had Jacob not done this, all the sheep would have been black and all the goats spotted and Laban would have known that something was wrong. Thus Jacob had to produce sheep for Laban. He did so when the offspring would be of inferior quality.</i>
FEEBLE. <i>Atufim</i> means feeble; compare, <i>Their soul fainted</i> (titattaf) <i>in them</i> (Ps. 107:5).

Verse 5

YOUR FATHER’S COUNTENANCE. I can tell by looking at your father’s countenance that he is not (<i>ennenu</i>) toward me as beforetime.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads: <i>Ro-eh anokhi et pene avichen ki enennu elai kitmol shilshom. Pene</i> (countenance) is a plural. The word <i>enennu</i> can be translated: he is not or it is not. If <i>enennu</i> is connected to <i>pene</i> the Bible should have employed <i>enam</i>, which is a plural, rather than <i>enennu</i> which is a singular. Hence <i>enennu</i> cannot refer to <i>pene</i>. It is rather connected to <i>avikhen</i> (your father) (Filwarg, Cherez). The verse is thus to be rendered: I see by your father’s countenance that he is not toward me as beforetime.</i> On the other hand, <i>enennu</i> (he is not) may refer to countenance (<i>pene</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In this case the meaning of the verse is: I see your father’s countenance that it (the countenance) is not toward me as beforetime.</i> Compare, <i>The anger</i> (pene) <i>of the Lord hath divided them</i> (chillekam) (Lam. 4:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Where we find <i>pene</i>, a plural, connected to a singular. In this verse the verb pertaining to <i>pene, chillekam</i> (hath divided them) is in the singular. We thus see that while <i>pene</i> is a plural, it can be treated as a singular (Filwarg, Cherez). Hence <i>enennu</i> can refer to face. Weiser explains that <i>pene</i> is not really treated as a singular. It is a plural but a singular follows it for emphasis.</i>

Verse 6



Verse 7

HATH MOCKED ME. <i>Hetel</i> is irregular in that it lacks a <i>dagesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>dagesh</i> should have been placed in the <i>tav</i>. According to I.E. <i>hetel</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>. The middle root letter of a <i>pi’el</i> perfect receives a <i>dagesh</i>, and the first root letter is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>. Thus “mocked” should have been vocalized <i>hittel</i>. Hence <i>hetel</i> is irregular (Filwarg).</i> It should have a <i>dagesh</i> like the word <i>va-yehattel</i> (and he mocked) in <i>that Elijah mocked</i> (va-yehattel) <i>them</i> (I Kings 18:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yehattel</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>, has a <i>dagesh</i> and follows the normal <i>pi’el</i> paradigm.</i> The meaning of <i>hetel</i> is mocked.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">It means to mock by deceiving.</i>
TEN TIMES.

Verse 8

From the statement, <i>The streaked shall be thy wages</i>, it is clear that Laban changed Jacob’s hire so that it was limited only to streaked goats.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob’s wages were to consist of speckled, spotted and streaked goats. Laban, as this verse indicates, changed his original conditions and gave Jacob only one of this kind rather than all three.</i> At other times Laban limited Jacob’s hire to speckled goats.

Verse 9

THUS GOD HATH TAKEN AWAY. <i>Va-yatzel</i> (hath taken away) is similar in meaning to <i>va-yenatzelu</i> (and they despoiled) in <i>And they despoiled</i> (va-yenatzelu) <i>the Egyptians</i> (Ex. 12:36).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">They both mean to take. However, there is a difference in nuance between them. In our verse the word is in the <i>hifil</i> and it connotes taking what rightfully belongs to one. In Ex. 12:36 it is in the <i>pi’el</i> (the intensive) and it means to take highhandedly, to despoil (Weiser).</i> Both (<i>va-yatzel</i> and <i>va-yenatzelu</i>) come from the same root as <i>hatzileni</i> (deliver me)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The root being <i>nun, tzadi, lamed</i>.</i> (Gen. 32:12), although in the latter case the meaning of the word is a bit different from the first two examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Here it means to save from death, take away from danger, to deliver.</i> What Jacob told his wives was also true.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Not only is what Jacob reported concerning Laban’s cheating true, but the report of the dream is also true.

NOW LABAN WAS GONE TO SHEAR HIS SHEEP. That were in the care of his sons who were three days journey away, as is reported by Scripture (Gen. 30:35, 36).

THE TERAPHIM.

Quite the contrary, it is juxtaposed with the ephod, a garment used in the service of the Lord.</i> it can be explained in two ways. One, the prophet says, <i>Israel shall be without king, and without prince</i> because God chose only members of the Davidic family to be kings over Israel. Therefore the verse which follows says, <i>afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king</i> (v. 5). The verse continues, <i>and without sacrifice, and without pillar</i>; this refers to sacrifices and pillars to the idols. In a similar manner, <i>and without ephod</i> also refers to idolatry, because the worshippers of Baal made an imitation of the ephod that Moses made.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The two interpretations of Hos. 3:4 are: A. The verse deals with idol worship, hence the juxtaposition of ephod and teraphim. B. The verse deals both with the worship of God and with idolatry. According to the latter interpretation <i>and without ephod or teraphim</i> means neither the worship of God nor idolatry.</i> Hence Scripture reads <i>ephod</i> and not “the ephod” as in <i>Bring hither the ephod</i> (I Sam. 23:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. ephod means <i>an</i> ephod. <i>The</i> ephod, with the definite article prefixed to it, is the ephod made by Moses.</i> Therefore <i>an ephod in his hand</i> (<i>Ibid</i>. v. 6) does not refer to the ephod made by Moses. I will explain the ephod and offer irrefutable proofs for my interpretation concerning it in the proper place if God will be kind to me and grant me life.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I.E.’s “long commentary” on Ex. 28:6.</i> The second interpretation is that <i>and without ephod or teraphim</i> means, they will neither serve God (<i>without ephod</i>) nor idols (<i>or teraphim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the ephod mentioned in Hos. 3:4 refers to the one used in the worship of the Lord.</i> That teraphim are idols can be ascertained by Laban’s referring to them as gods (v. 30).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the teraphim were used in idol worship although they were not originally made for that purpose. This validates I.E.’s interpretation that the teraphim refer to idol worship. In Hosea I.E. explains this second interpretation as follows: <i>and without sacrifice</i> to God, <i>and without pillar</i> to Baal, <i>and without ephod</i> to God <i>or teraphim</i> to Baal.</i> Some say that Rachel stole the teraphim in order to keep her father from idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi.</i> If this were the case, why did she take them with her and not bury them on the way?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As Jacob did with the idols his children had on them. Cf. Gen. 35:2-4.</i> The most likely reason that Rachel stole the teraphim was that Laban, her father, was an astrologer, and Rachel feared that he would look at the stars and discover which way they fled.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The teraphim, which were in human form, drew powers from the stars and revealed hidden things to Laban. Krinsky and Weiser suggest that I.E. is of the opinion that the teraphim had images of stars on them and through them Laban could divine hidden things.</i>

Verse 20

AND JACOB OUTWITTED LABAN. Jacob stole nothing from Laban save his “wits.” Scripture uses the term heart for wits because the heart is the seat of man’s intelligence.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20 literally reads: And Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Aramean. I.E. points out that unlike Rachel, who stole the teraphim, Jacob stole only Laban’s heart; i.e., he fooled him.</i>

Verse 24

AND GOD CAME TO LABAN THE ARAMEAN. This occurred before <i>he overtook him</i> (v. 23). Therefore its (v. 4) meaning is, and God had already come to Laban the Aramean. I have already pointed out many similar instances. <sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Of the use of the pluperfect. See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 1:9. Would Laban spend the night doing nothing after overtaking Jacob, thereby give him a chance to escape? Thus we must assume that upon overtaking Jacob, he confronted him and that <i>And God came to Laban…in a dream</i> means, and God had come to Laban…in a dream.</i> God appeared to Laban out of respect for Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Laban was no prophet. It was only out of God’s regard for Jacob that He appeared to Laban.</i>
EITHER GOOD OR BAD. Do not speak to Jacob about returning even if you think it is for his good.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This is what Scripture means by good.

What God meant was, do not try to convince him to return by threats, or by promises, even if the latter are sincere (Weiser).</i>

Verse 25

AND LABAN WITH HIS BRETHREN PITCHED. <i>Et echav</i> is to be rendered: with his brethren.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Et</i> is the sign of the direct object Hence <i>et echav</i> means his brethren. The verse thus might conceivably be rendered: Laban pitched his brethren. However, this is impossible since pitched refers to tents, hence I.E. points out that <i>et</i> here is not the sign of the direct object but is to be rendered with.</i> 
The word tent written in reference to Jacob also carries over to Laban.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The object following pitched with reference to Laban is missing, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> That is, now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban pitched his tent with his brethren in the mountain of Gilead.

LONGEST. <i>Nikhsof</i> (longest) is an infinitive in the <i>nifal</i>. It is similar to <i>nilchom</i> (fight) in <i>or did he ever fight</i> (nilchom) <i>against them</i> (Jud. 11:25). 
The word <i>nikhsafta</i> means thou longest. <i>Yikhsof</i> (eager) in <i>He is like a lion that is eager</i> (yikhsof) <i>to tear in pieces</i> (Ps. 17:12) is similar.

Verse 33

AND LABAN WENT INTO JACOB’S TENT, AND INTO LEAH’S TENT, AND INTO THE TENT OF THE TWO MAID-SERVANTS. Both maid-servants shared one tent. Or it (v. 33) means into the tent of each one of the two maid-servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And into the tent of the two maid-servants</i> is short for: into the tent of each of the two maid-servants (Weiser).</i> Afterward<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">After searching the tents of Jacob, Leah and the two maid-servants.</i> Laban entered Leah’s tent a second time. Proof of this is Scripture’s statement, <i>And he went out of Leah’s tent</i>. It is also possible that Jacob’s tent was between Leah’s and Rachel’s tents.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The question which I.E. deals with here is: Why did Laban search Rachel’s tent last? We would expect him to search her tent after that of Leah. I.E. suggests that Jacob’s tent was in the middle, between that of Rachel and Leah, and that to the side of Leah’s tent stood the tent (or tents) of the maid servants. After searching Jacob’s tent, Laban decided to search the tent of his older daughter first. Coming out of Leah’s tent he found the tent of the maid servants and searched it On his way back he stepped another time into Leah’s tent, found nothing there and proceeded to search Rachel’s tent He did not search Rachel’s tent after that of Leah because it was not next to it (Cherez).</i> However, it appears to me that the Bible tells us what happened in abridged form<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">It omits telling us that the search of Rachel’s tent took place after the search of Leah’s tent. Scripture first tells us about those tents where Laban found nothing. It then tells us what happened when Laban searched Rachel’s tent.</i> and puts off the mention of Rachel’s tent for last. The sequence of events was as follows. Laban searched Jacob’s tent, then Leah’s tent, then Rachel’s tent and then the tent of the two maid-servants. The meaning of our verses (33 and 34) is that Laban searched Jacob’s tent, Leah’s tent and the tent of the two maid-servants and found nothing because there was nothing of his there. Scripture then tells us that when Laban went out of Leah’s tent and into Rachel’s tent where the teraphim had been, Rachel had by then taken them and put them in the saddle of the camel.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture puts off telling what happened when he searched Rachel’s tent in order to be able to elaborate.</i>

Verse 34

[IN THE SADDLE.] Some say that <i>kar</i> (saddle) is a kind of saddle cloth.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser.</i> However, I believe that the term <i>kar ha-gamal</i> (saddle of the camel)<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains <i>kar ha-gamal</i> as a double word and that Scripture uses two words having the same meaning even though one word would suffice.

Weiser claims that I.E.’s comment was transposed from verse 49 by a scribe who mistakenly thought that <i>it</i> referred to the heap. What I.E. is saying is that the heap was called Galeed and the pillar Mizpah. Cherez claims that <i>it</i> refers to the place.

Verse 51

WHICH I HAVE SET UP.

Laban said, <i>I have cast</i>, because it was Laban and his brethren who made the heap, for we read, <i>And they took stones and made a heap</i> (v. 46).</i> They cast stones and formed the heap. <i>Yariti</i> comes from the same root as <i>yarah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>yod, resh, heh</i> and it means to cast.</i> (cast) in <i>hath He cast</i> (yarah) <i>into the sea</i> (Ex. 15:4).

Verse 9

CAMP. The word for camp (<i>machaneh</i>) can be either masculine or feminine<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. makes the point because the word is found in both the masculine and the feminine in our verse. <i>Machaneh ha-achat</i> (one camp) is feminine. However, the suffix of <i>ve-hikkahu</i> (smite it) is masculine, as is <i>machanah ha-nishar</i> (the camp which is left).</i> like the word for house (<i>bayit</i>) and place (<i>makom</i>).
THEN THE CAMP WHICH IS LEFT SHALL ESCAPE. Perhaps<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-hayah</i> does not indicate certainty, for how could Jacob be certain one camp would escape? Its meaning is perhaps. Thus rather than translating our verse: then the camp which is left shall escape, it should he rendered: perhaps the camp that is left shall escape.</i> the camp that is left shall flee, or perhaps my brother’s anger shall be assuaged after smiting one of the camps, or perhaps God will send them relief and deliverance. <i>If the Arameans be too strong for me, then thou shalt save me</i> (II Sam. 10:11) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Here, too, there was no certainty. What Joab said was, if the Arameans be too strong for me perhaps you will be able to save me. Thus <i>ve-hayita li li-shu’ah</i> (II Sam. 10:11) does not mean, then thou shalt save me.</i> Rabbi Solomon’s<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi.</i> comment, to the effect that <i>then the camp that is left shall escape</i> means that the camp will be saved despite Esau’s intention, is Midrashic.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi apparently interpreted <i>ve-hayah</i> as indicating certainty, then (<i>ve-hayah</i>) the camp that is left shall escape, i.e., despite Esau’s will, it shall be saved. I.E. claims that this is not the literal meaning of the verse (Cherez).</i> Although God promised Jacob, <i>And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth</i> (Gen. 28:14),<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This verse indicates that Jacob’s children would not be destroyed. I.E. now argues that one cannot substantiate Rashi’s interpretation that Jacob was certain, on the basis of God’s promise to him in Gen. 28:14, that at least one of his camps would escape (Cherez).</i> Jacob did not know whether it referred to the children he now had, or to children he would have in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">How could Jacob be sure that one camp would escape, since the promise may not have applied to the children he now had (Cherez).</i> A prophet does not know hidden things unless God reveals them to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that Jacob was a prophet does not mean that he knew that God’s promise recorded in Gen 28:14 applied to his present children.</i> Jacob was alive when Joseph was sold into slavery and yet was unaware of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">He thought Joseph was dead and was unaware that he had been sold into slavery.</i> Similarly Elisha said, <i>and the Lord hath hid it from me</i> (II Kings 4:27). The above also answers those who ask, why was Jacob afraid considering that God promised that he would protect him, viz., God’s assurance, <i>and I will be with thee</i> (Gen. 31:3)? The latter is also the promise referred to by Jacob when he said, <i>And thou saidest I will surely do thee good</i> (v. 13).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">We do not find God saying, <i>I will surely do thee good</i>. Hence when Jacob said, <i>And Thou saidest: I will surely do thee good</i>, he was restating, <i>and I will be with thee</i>.</i> Jacob was afraid because of the possibility that he alone would escape. Furthermore, we know that the personality of the individual is taken into account when his sins are considered, be they major or minor transgressions. Therefore, a minor sin committed by a great personality is considered a major transgression. Jacob was afraid that he may have sinned or inadvertently transgressed in his mind and as a result of this God no longer would be with him. Do not be amazed at what I write, for behold, Moses the greatest of men, whom God himself sent to bring Israel out of Egypt erred and God sent an angel to kill him.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Moses erred in not immediately circumcising his son. As a result God sent an angel to kill him (Ex. 4:24-26). God acted in this manner because a minor sin committed by a man of Moses’ stature was considered by the Almighty to be a major transgression. Similarly Jacob was afraid that he might have committed a minor sin resulting in God’s removal of His divine protection, hence his anxiety.</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11

I AM NOT WORTHY. <i>Katonti</i> (I am not worthy) is vocalized like <i>yakholti</i> (I have prevailed) in <i>gam yakholti</i> (Gen. 30:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kal</i> in the perfect is usually vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the middle root letter. However, <i>katonti</i> and <i>yacholti</i> are vocalized with a <i>cholam</i>.</i> The meaning of our verse is: I am insignificant and of little worth for you to have done all these merciful deeds for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads: I am small. I.E. interprets this to mean I am insignificant. Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 76:4: <i>Katonti</i>.

Verse 12

AND SMITE ME. <i>And smite me</i> applies to two phrases.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-hekkani</i> is in the singular and <i>prima facie</i> refers only to Jacob.

I.E. says that captains of should be read as if written twice, i.e., And two men, captains of bands, were captains of Saul’s son. Cf.

Verse 16



Verse 17

AND PUT A SPACE. The word <i>revach</i> means a space. <i>Harevachah</i> (respite) in <i>That there was respite</i> (harevachah) (Ex. 8:11) is close in meaning to it. The meaning of the latter is, there was a separation between one plague and the other. It is similar to <i>ve-ravach</i> (found relief) in <i>so Saul found relief</i> (ve-ravach le-sha’ul) (I Sam. 16:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Saul had space. Figuratively speaking, he went out of his straits to an open space. Thus the root <i>resh, vav, chet</i> can refer to physical space, or space in time, to relief.</i>

Verse 18

AND ASKETH THEE SAYING. <i>U-she’elekha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">when a <i>kal</i> in the third person has the suffix <i>kha</i> added to it, the second root letter is usually vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> (and asketh thee) is vocalized the same as <i>ahevekha</i> (he loveth thee).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 15:16. It, too, is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i> rather than with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath the second root letter (the <i>heh</i>).</i>

Verse 19



Verse 20

AND ALL THAT FOLLOWED. Scripture says this because there were five groups.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Goats, sheep, camels, cattle and asses. Scripture notes that Jacob commanded the foremost, the second and the third group, <i>and all that followed</i> what to tell Esau because there were five groups and each group was instructed what to say.</i>
WHEN YE FIND HIM. The <i>tzadi</i> of <i>be-motza’akhem</i> (when ye find) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> because it precedes a guttural.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">When an infinitive is combined with a pronominal suffix, the second root letter is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>, as in <i>be-shovbekha</i> (Deut. 6:7) or <i>tofsekhem</i> (Josh. 8:8). However, in our case rather than being vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>, the second root letter is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>. We thus read, <i>motza’akhem</i> rather than <i>motzakhem</i>. I.E. explains that this is so because the <i>tsadi</i> precedes a guttural (the <i>alef</i>) (Cherez).</i> This is so even though we do not find another example of this in the Bible.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In all other similar cases, i.e., even preceding a guttural, the second root letter is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>. Compare, <i>shomakhem</i> (Deut. 5:20), where the <i>mem</i> is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> even though it precedes an <i>ayin</i>, a guttural (Cherez). Thus I.E. notes that while his explanation is correct with regard to our word it does not hold for similar words in Scripture.</i>

Verse 21

FOR HE SAID. He said in his heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob thought this. He did not instruct his messengers to say this to Esau, as one might gather from the verse.</i> These are the words of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Moses in writing the Torah explained what motivated Jacob to send these gifts to Esau.</i>
[I WILL APPEASE HIM.] <i>Akhapperah</i> (I will appease him) means I will cover or hide.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>akhapperah</i> is <i>caf, peh, resh</i>, which means to cover.</i> <i>Panav</i> (him)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Panav</i> usually means face or countenance. Here it means anger. Jacob said, “I will cover his anger”; i.e., I will appease him. Weiser suggests that since anger is expressed in the face, face is, by extension, occasionally used as a synonym for anger.</i> means his anger. <i>Peneha</i> (her countenance) in <i>and her countenance</i> (u-faneha) <i>was no more sad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. this should be rendered: her anger was no more, i.e., she was pacified.</i> (I Sam. 1:18) is similar.

Verse 22



Verse 23

AND PASSED OVER THE FORD OF THE JABBOK. Jacob passed over first.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads: <i>And he rose up that night and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and (he) passed over the ford Jabbok</i> (v. 23). <i>And he took them, and sent them over the stream</i> (v. 24). This is difficult to understand. Why interrupt the sequence of the narrative with <i>and (he) passed over the ford Jabbok</i>? Furthermore, if Jacob passed over the ford by himself, how could he take his wives and children over? Hence I.E. interprets that Scripture tells us that Jacob took his wives and children over but prior to this he had gone over himself (to see if it was safe for the others to pass-Nachmanides). Scripture then resumes the narrative by relating, <i>And he took them and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had</i> (Cherez).</i> He then returned and took his wives and children and brought them over the ford. Thus the meaning of <i>and passed over</i> is and he had already passed over. He then went back for a final look to see if anything was forgotten.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">After taking his family across the river Jacob went back for a final look. Hence he was left alone.</i>

Verse 24



Verse 25

AND THERE WRESTLED A MAN. <i>Va-ye’avek</i> (and there wrestled) comes from the same root as <i>avak</i> (dust). They struggled so that dust arose between them.
UNTIL THE BREAKING OF THE DAY. <i>Ad alot ha-shachar</i> (until the breaking of the day) means until the darkness of the night went away.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets <i>alot</i> (breaking) to mean go up, i.e., to depart, and <i>shacher</i> (dawn) to mean darkness, for this is what the root of <i>shachar</i> means.</i> Others say that <i>shachar</i> (dawn) refers to the image of light that appears in the clouds before sunrise.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>shachar</i> means dawn and <i>alot</i> the rising. <i>Alot ha-shachar</i> thus means the breaking of dawn.</i> <i>Shacher</i> (light) in <i>wherein there is no light</i> (shacher) (Is. 8:20) is similar.

Verse 26

THAT HE PREVAILED NOT AGAINST HIM. The angel against Jacob.
HE TOUCHED THE HOLLOW OF HIS THIGH. Jacob’s thigh.

LET US TAKE OUR JOURNEY. Some say that <i>nisah</i> (let us take our journey) is an imperative.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>nisah</i> (let us take our journey) means, take your journey.

The usual imperative form for take your journey is <i>sa</i>. The commentators quoted by I.E. point out that in the elongated imperative the first letter of the root is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> and the last with a <i>kamatz</i>, as in <i>shilchah</i>. Cf.

According to the second interpretation “work” can refer directly to cattle, for one’s possessions are one’s work.</i> Also, one’s property is called <i>melakhah</i>, as in <i>whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods</i> (melekhet) (Ex. 22:7). The word messenger (<i>malakh</i>) comes from the same root. A <i>malakh</i> (messenger) is so called because he is under the control of the one who sends him. The meaning of the word <i>regel</i> (the pace) is the same as <i>le-ragli</i> (because of me),<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-regel</i> (according to the pace) means because. Although the basic meaning of <i>melachah</i> is changed in the second interpretation, the meaning of <i>le-regel</i> (because) remains unchanged.</i> as in <i>and the Lord hath blessed thee because of me</i> (le-ragli) (Gen. 30:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of Gen. 30:30.</i> However, it is possible that <i>le-regel</i> should be taken literally, since Jacob led the animals on foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>melakhah</i> means cattle, why not interpret <i>regel</i> literally as meaning feet, since the animals walked, viz., according to the pace (foot) of the cattle.</i>

I.E. explains that this is not the way to interpret the verse. <i>Lammah zeh</i> is not to be connected to <i>emtza chen</i>, etc. The verse is to be interpreted: <i>lammah zeh</i>, why this? That is, why do this when I have no need of it? <i>Emtza chen be-ene adoni</i> is another clause meaning: I merely want to find favor in your eyes (Weiser, Krinsky). Cf. Rashi.</i>

AND JACOB CAME IN PEACE. <i>Shalem</i> (peace) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shalem</i> can be taken to be the name of a place, Salem.

Verse 19

THE PARCEL OF GROUND. A portion in the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains that Jacob did not buy the <i>parcel of ground where he had spread his tent</i>.

Whosoever has a portion in it is as though he had a portion in the world to come.

Verse 20

[AND CALLED IT EL-ELOHE-ISRAEL.]<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">God, the God of Israel.</i> Saadiah explained that <i>and called it El-elohe-Israel</i> means, He called to the Lord, “El-elohe-Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>lo</i> can mean either it or him. Saadiah had difficulty in accepting that Jacob called the altar God, the God of Israel. Hence he did not interpret <i>lo</i> as meaning it, i.e., the altar, but rather as Him, i.e., God. He interprets our verse as: And called to Him, God, God of Israel (Krinsky). For a slightly different interpretation see Cherez.</i> However, the correct interpretation is that he called the altar El-elohe-Israel (God, the God of Israel). Moses similarly called the altar he erected <i>Adonai-nissi</i> (the Lord is my banner) (Ex. 17:15) because of the miracle God performed in that place. Similarly, when the Divine Presence will once again return to Jerusalem, the city will be called <i>Adonai-shammah</i> (the Lord is there) (Ezek. 48:35). Jacob similarly called the altar whereupon he served the Lord, El-elohe-Israel (God, the God of Israel) because God came to his aid. The name <i>El</i> (God) means the One who is powerful and mighty.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">God thereby demonstrated His might Therefore, Jacob called him El, mighty and powerful.</i>
ELOHE-ISRAEL. He saved him on the way and ensured his safe arrival in Canaan, where Succoth<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 17.</i> and Shechem are located.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Where Jacob now camped.</i> I believe that Jacob spent many years in the city of Shechem, for at the time of Jacob’s arrival in Shechem, Dinah was less than seven years old and also Simeon and Levi were yet small children.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob stayed in Laban’s house for 20 years. He married Leah and Rachel after seven years, and with the exception of Benjamin, all of his children were born in the next seven years (cf. I.E. on Gen. 30:23). Reuben, his eldest, was a little over 12. Simeon and Levi, the next two in order, a bit younger. Dinah, who was born in the 14th year of Jacob’s service to Laban, had to be under seven. The question thus arises, could what is described in Chapter 34 apply to such a little girl? Dinah is described as a young lady of age. Furthermore, could children of Simeon and Levi’s age, preadolescents, overcome and slay a city? Could pre-adolescents act and talk the way Jacob’s sons are described as doing in Chapter 34? I.E. thus suggests that many years passed between the end of Chapter 33 and Chapter 34. During these years Jacob’s children had grown. It should be noted that in putting forth this interpretation I.E. is taking issue with the Midrash which states that Simeon and Levi were 13 when they destroyed Shechem. Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 80.</i>

A REPROACH. It will be a reproach for generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cherez interprets I.E. to mean that future generations will look down upon us. They will ask, how could they give their sister to an uncircumcised man?</i> This is the meaning of <i>because he had wrought a vile deed in Israel</i> (v. 7).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the vile deed refers to having intercourse with an uncircumcised male (Weiser). Israel in verse 7 refers to a later time when there was a people of Israel. It was then shameful to recall that Dinah had slept with an uncircumcised man (Joseph ben Eliezer Ha-Sephardi).</i> 
[13. AND SPOKE BECAUSE HE HAD DEFILED.] And spoke to Shechem who had (<i>asher</i>) defiled their sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads: <i>va-yedabberu, asher timme et dinah achotam</i> which literally means: and they spoke who had defiled Dinah their sister. This makes no sense. Hence I.E. points out that Shechem, who is mentioned in the first part of the verse (<i>et shechem</i>), is also the object here. We should thus read it as if it were written: <i>va-yedabberu et shechem asher timme et dinah achotam</i>, viz., and spoke to Shechem who had defiled their sister. It should be noted that according to this interpretation, <i>asher</i> means who.</i> We may interpret our verse in this manner because we find Scripture stating, <i>dabbero le-shalom</i> (Gen. 37:4), which is to be rendered: speak peaceably unto him (Gen. 37:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. claims that <i>dabber et Shechem</i> is grammatically similar to <i>dabbero</i>. For an explanation of their linguistic similarity see Filwarg. See also notes to Gen. 37:4. For alternate interpretations see Weiser, Cherez and Krinsky.</i> On the other hand <i>asher</i> may mean because. In this case the Bible is telling us that they answered with guile because (<i>asher</i>) he had defiled Dinah their sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cherez.</i>
TO ONE THAT IS UNCIRCUMCISED. One whose sexual member is uncircumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew literally reads: to one who has an <i>orlah</i>, hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> The meaning of the term <i>orlah</i> (uncircumcised) is something which is heavy. <i>Aral</i> (uncircumcised), in <i>uncircumcised</i> (aral) <i>lips</i> (Ex. 6:12), and <i>arelah</i> (dull), in <i>their ear is dull</i> (arelah) (Jer. 6:10), are similar. An <i>orlah</i> is something which lays heavy because it is an unnecessary appendage.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Krinsky. In the case of the foreskin the heaviness is physical. In the case of lips and ears, metaphoric. I.E. renders “uncircumcised lips” as heavy lips. There is, as it were, a burden on the lips which makes speaking difficult. The same applies to the ears.</i> Those who say that Abraham blemished himself by undergoing circumcision, and thereby violated God’s charge to him, <i>and be thou whole</i> (Gen. 17:1), err. The opposite is true.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">By circumcision Abraham became “whole.” His impediment was removed. So Cherez and Filwarg. For an alternate interpretation see Weiser.</i> Proof of this can be offered from the animal kingdom. <sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Animals have no foreskin. We thus see that it is an unnecessary appendage.</i> As to their query, why remove that which God created, we respond that God also created the umbilical cord.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that God created appendages that require removal (Weiser).</i>

The reason he is listed among the chiefs of Eliphaz<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Adah’s son. See note 8.</i> is that he lived among them. It is also possible, since he was Oholibamah’s youngest son, that his mother died when he was still a child and that Adah raised him along with her own family and Scripture includes him with her children. Our case is similar to <i>the five sons of Michal</i> (II Sam. 21:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The five sons of Michal were really the children of Merab. Cf. <i>San</i>. 19b., “Michal bore these five children? Did not Merab give birth to them?” The Talmud answers, “Merab bore them but Michal raised them.

Scripture similarly says that Amalek was a son of Adah<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16 lists the chief of Amalek among the children of Adah. However, verse 12 states, <i>And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek</i>.

Verse 12 state that Timna was Eliphaz’s concubine, not Esau’s concubine. Cherez posits a scribal error; i.e., in place of <i>her husband</i>, read her son. Weiser suggests that I.E. had a tradition that Timna was first Esau’s concubine and then Eliphaz’s concubine, hence I.E.’s statement, “concubine of her husband.” The Bible lists Amalek among Adah’s children because Adah helped raise him (Weiser).</i>
[CHIEF.] The meaning of <i>alluf</i> is a prince or chief. However, this is not the meaning of <i>alluf</i> (docile)<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. translates <i>alluf</i> as ox. <i>Ke-kheves alluf</i> does not mean like a great sheep, but rather like a lamb or like an ox.</i> in <i>ke-kheves alluf</i> (like a docile lamb) (Jer. 11:19). In the latter verse the <i>caf</i> prefixed to <i>keves</i> (lamb) also pertains to <i>alluf</i>; i.e., the verse is to be read as if written <i>ke-kheves ke-alluf</i> (like a lamb, like an ox). The latter is normal Hebrew usage,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It is normal Hebrew usage to place two <i>cafs</i> in succession, meaning like this or like that.</i> as can be seen in <i>I went about as though it had been my friend</i> (ke-re’a) <i>or my brother</i> (ke-ach) (Ps. 35:14).

SEIR. We do not know his pedigree. Scripture lists the children of Seir to inform us that they were of a different lineage from the children of Esau.

THE HORITE. <i>Chori</i> (Horite) means nobles.

The computation of the 193 years is as follows: The Israelites spent 210 years in Egypt, starting with Jacob’s descent to Egypt. Jacob lived there 17 years before he died. Esau died on the very day that Jacob did (<i>Sotah</i> 13a). We thus subtract 17 from 210 and we get 193 (Cherez).</i> when we find double the number of kings in Israel in about the same number of years?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The kingdom of Israel lasted for 241 years during which time Israel had 19 kings (Krinsky). I.E. says that Israel had double the number of kings of the Edomites. Either he uses a round number or does not count Zimri (I Kings 16:15) who reigned seven days; Zechariah (II Kings 15:8) who reigned six months; and Shallum who reigned a month (<i>Ibid</i>., v. 13). Thus Israel had 16 kings in 241 years. Why, then, is it so hard to believe that eight Edomite kings reigned in 193 years (Krinsky)? Cherez explains that the first 16 kings of Israel reigned 210 years. Thus Israel had 16 kings in 210 years.</i> Furthermore, there were also proportionally many more kings of Judah in the same time period than the eight Edomite kings who reigned till the age of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Judah had 21 kings in 500 years (Krinsky). Hence why couldn’t the Edomites have eight kings in 193 years.</i> The truth is that king, in <i>before there reigned any king over the children of Israel</i>, refers to Moses who was king over Israel, and so it is written, <i>And there was a king in Jeshurun</i> (Deut. 33:5).

Verse 2

The meaning of <i>These are the generations of Jacob</i> is: these are the events which befell him and the incidents which came upon him. <i>Toledot</i> (generations) comes from the same root as <i>yeled</i> (bring forth) in <i>What a day may bring forth</i> (yeled) (Prov. 27:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Toledot</i> is not rendered generations but events, as evidenced by the word of the same root, <i>yod, lamed, dalet</i> in Prov. 27:1.</i>
BEING STILL A LAD, EVEN WITH THE SONS OF BILHAH, AND WITH THE SONS OF ZILPAH. The sons of the concubines (the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah) made Joseph their attendant (servant) since he was their younger brother. This was the <i>evil report of them</i> which he brought unto their father. Had the children of Leah, the mistress of the house, made Joseph their attendant, then no wrong would have been done.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph would thus not have had any <i>evil report</i> of his brothers to bring unto their father.</i> The view that <i>evil report</i> pertains to limbs torn from living animals is a Midrashic interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash Joseph told his father that his brothers ate limbs torn from living animals. Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 84:7.</i> That Joseph did not bring an evil report to Jacob concerning Leah’s children is clear from the fact that Scripture only mentions the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah in our verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse mentions only the sons of Zilpah and the sons of Bilhah. Hence the pronominal suffix of <i>dibbtam</i> (report of them) must refer to Zilpah and Bilhah’s sons. This comment is either a proof of what I.E. wrote above, viz., that Joseph spoke only about the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah (Krinsky), or its purpose is to negate a Midrashic statement to the effect that Joseph spoke ill only of Leah’s children, viz., that he told Jacob that Leah’s children refer to the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah as the children of slave girls (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 3

BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON OF HIS OLD AGE. This is to be taken literally since Joseph was born to Jacob when the latter was ninety-one years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph was 30 when Pharaoh appointed him vizier over Egypt. Jacob came to Egypt nine years later, after the seven years of plenty and two of famine (Gen. 45:11). At that time Jacob was 130 years old (<i>Ibid</i>., 47:9) and Joseph 39. Thus Jacob was 91 years older than Joseph (Cherez). I.E. notes that <i>ben zekunim</i> is to be taken literally, viz., son of old age, because the Midrash and Onkelos interpret it to mean a wise son. Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 84:8 and Rashi.</i> Also, Benjamin, his brother, is referred to by Scripture as <i>a child of his</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Jacob’s.</i> <i>old age</i> (Gen. 44:20).

Compare, <i>Behold, I will destroy</i> (go’er) <i>the seed for your hurt</i> (Mal. 2:3).

Verse 23

THAT THEY STRIPPED. <i>Va-yafshitu</i> (that they stripped)<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yafshitu</i> is a <i>hifil. Hifil</i> is the causative form.

Joseph was thus left standing naked (Cherez). Cf. Rashi. However, Cherez’s interpretation seems forced. It appears that I.E. identified the <i>ketonet passim</i> with the garment worn next to the skin.</i>

A CARAVAN OF ISHMAELITES. <i>Orechat</i> is to be rendered caravan as Onkelos does. A caravan is so called because it travels on the roads (<i>orechot</i>).
SPICERY. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See notes to I.E.’s comments on Gen. 1:26.</i> explains <i>nekhot</i> (spicery) to mean a precious thing. <i>Bet nekhoto</i> (his treasure house) in <i>and showed them all his treasure-house</i> (bet nekhoto) (II Kings 20:13) is similar. <i>Nekhot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Spelled <i>nun, caf, alef, tav</i>.</i> and <i>nekhoto</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Spelled <i>nun, caf, vav, tav</i>. The problem is that the word is not so spelled in II Kings 20:13. Krinsky and Cherez suggest that since the word is pronounced <i>nekhoto</i>, it is as if a <i>vav</i> is placed after the <i>caf</i>.</i> are similar because the <i>vav</i> and the <i>alef</i> are interchangeable since they are quiescent letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>alef</i> and <i>vav</i> in <i>nekhot</i> are not pronounced. Hence they are quiescent. I.E. refers to the <i>alef, vav, heh, yod</i> as quiescent letters (<i>otiyot ha-nach</i>) because they are not always enunciated.</i>
AND BALM. The word for balm is encountered in Scripture vocalized with a quiescent <i>sheva</i> beneath the <i>tzadi</i> (<i>utzri</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">It is so found in our verse but not so found elsewhere in Scripture. I.E.’s basic point is that balm is spelled with a <i>sheva</i> in our verse, <i>tzeri</i>. However, there is an important grammatical aside in this note. I.E. calls our <i>sheva</i> a quiescent <i>sheva</i>, a <i>sheva nach</i>. However, according to standard grammatical usage a <i>sheva</i> following a long vowel is vocal. Thus our <i>sheva</i> should be a vocal <i>sheva</i>, a <i>sheva na</i>, and not a quiescent one. Therefore our word should be read <i>u-tzeri</i> and not <i>utzri</i>. William Chomsky points out that the vocal pronunciation of the <i>sheva</i> following a long vowel was introduced by the Kimchis and that the pre-Kimchi grammarians had no such concept. I.E.’s note seems to bear this out. Cf. W. Chomsky, “The pronunciation of the Sheva,” <i>The Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, Vol. LXII, October, 1971. For an alternate interpretation see Cherez.</i> We also find it vocalized with a <i>chataf kamatz</i> beneath the <i>tzadi</i>, viz., <i>Is there no balm</i> (ha-tzori) <i>in Gilead</i>? (Jer. 8:22). It also appears with the <i>tzadi</i> vocalized with a <i>cholem</i>, viz., <i>and honey, and oil, and balm</i> (ve-tzori) (Ezek. 27:17). Saadiah Gaon explained that <i>tzeri</i> (balm)<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">He said that it is identical to an Arabic medicine called <i>triak</i> (Weiser).</i> is a mixture of 75 roots. Others say that <i>tzeri</i> is a type of fruit.

Verse 26

WHAT PROFIT. <i>Mah betza</i> means what profit. <i>Betza</i> (profit) is close in meaning to <i>chefetz</i> (desire). <i>What profit</i> (betza) <i>is there in my blood</i> (Ps. 30:10) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 30:10 continues, <i>Shall the dust praise Thee? Shall it declare Thy truth</i>? Hence what desire (<i>mah betza</i>) is there in my death? Similarly the meaning of <i>mah betza</i> in our verse is: what desire is there in slaying our brother.</i>

Verse 27

HE IS OUR BROTHER OUR FLESH. He is as our flesh<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">They obviously were not all one flesh.

However, they did not all have the same mother. Therefore the interpretation must be as follows: we all came from the same father.</i>

Verse 28

AND THERE PASSED BY. When the Ishmaelite merchantmen passed by them.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> of <i>va-ya’avru</i> (and there passed by) is to be rendered when rather than and. The meaning of the verse is: when the Midianite (Ishmaelite) merchantmen passed by, they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit (Krinsky). I.E.’s point is that the Midianites in our verse refers to the caravan of Ishmaelites of verse 25. Thus <i>va-ya’avru</i> does not introduce new material. Hence I.E.’s paraphrase: when, etc. (Filwarg).</i> Scripture refers to the Ishmaelites as Midianites because the Midianites are called Ishmaelites. The Book of Judges similarly says concerning the kings of Midian, <i>because they were Ishmaelites</i> (Jud. 8:24).

Verse 30

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

WITHOUT DOUBT TORN IN PIECES. <i>Toraf</i> (torn) is a <i>pu’al</i>.

Verse 35

AND HIS FATHER WEPT FOR HIM. Our sages interpreted this as referring to Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 84:19.

Isaac was overcome with grief over Jacob’s trouble.</i> The truth is that Isaac did not die until Joseph reached the age of twenty-nine.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Thus from this point of view the Midrashic interpretation is possible. I.E.’s accounting is as follows: Isaac was 60 when Jacob was born (Gen. 25:26). Jacob was 91 when Joseph was born (see note 7). Thus Isaac was 151 when Joseph was born. Isaac died at the age of 180 (Gen. 35:28), at which time Joseph was 29 years old as Isaac was 151 years older than Joseph. Joseph was 17 when he was sold. Thus Isaac lived 12 years past the year in which Joseph was sold (Weiser).</i> Some say that the prophetic spirit was removed from both Jacob and Isaac because of their mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The question arises, why didn’t Jacob and Isaac, two prophets, know that Joseph was alive?</i> They offer proof from Elisha.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">That a prophet cannot prophesy when in a state of depression.

Similarly Job states, <i>The nether-world</i> (she’ol) <i>is naked before Him</i> (Job 26:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The verse concludes, <i>And destruction (the grave) hath no covering</i>. Now <i>she’ol</i> is parallel to destruction (grave). Hence it, too, must mean grave.</i> There are many other verses which prove that <i>she’ol</i> does not refer to hell.

Verse 1

AND IT CAME TO PASS AT THAT TIME. This does not refer to the time that Joseph was sold.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As the sequence of chapters would tend to indicate.</i> It refers to the events that happened prior to that time. <i>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod…At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day</i> (Deut. 10:7, 8) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The two events described in the latter verse did not take place at the same time even though Deut. 10:8 says, <i>At that time</i>.</i> The tribe of Levi was chosen to minister unto the Lord in the second year while Israel journeyed to Gudgod in the fortieth year.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Following the Exodus.</i> I will explain the latter verses in their proper place. Why, then, did Scripture insert this chapter (Chap. 38) at this point when logic dictates that <i>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt</i> (Gen. 39:1) should follow <i>And the Midianites sold him (Joseph) into Egypt</i> (Gen. 37:36)?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Chap. 39 should follow Chap. 37.</i> The Bible placed this chapter (38) here to contrast the behavior of Joseph vis-a-vis his master’s wife with that of Judah toward his daughter-in-law.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph controlled his passions. When Potiphar’s wife said to him, <i>Lie with me</i> (Gen. 39:7) he refused. On the other hand when Judah saw the harlot in the entrance to Enaim he said to her, <i>Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee</i> (Gen. 38:16).</i> What forced me to offer this interpretation is the fact that only twenty-two years passed between the sale of Joseph and the descent of our ancestors into Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph was 17 when sold. He was 30 when appointed vizier over Egypt. Jacob came to Egypt after seven years of plenty and two of hunger passed. Thus a total of 22 years passed from the sale of Joseph to Jacob’s descent into Egypt (Cherez). It is impossible for the events described in Chap. 38 to have occurred in such a short time.</i> Now we learn in this chapter of the birth of Onan, Judah’s second son,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that not only does Scripture tell of the birth of Er, the eldest son of Judah, it also tells of the birth of and marriage of his second son, Onan, as well. Er was at least close to a year older than Onan. Thus at least 13 years had to pass between the sale of Joseph and the marriage of Onan and Tamar.</i> and his reaching the age of procreation, which at the very earliest starts at the age of 12. Scripture goes on to state, <i>And in the process of time</i> (v. 12).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew literally reads, <i>and the days became many</i>. That is, following Onan’s death Tamar, his widow, dwelt in her father’s house for a long time.</i> The chapter then tells us that Tamar conceived and gave birth to Perez. This same Perez came to Egypt with two sons of his own (Gen. 46:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">We thus have to allow at least 13 years for the birth and marriage of Onan. We have to allow for the years that Tamar spent in her father’s house. We have to allow 12 years for Perez’s coming of age and two each for the birth of his sons. All of this could not have happened in 22 years, even assuming the above minimum figures.</i> Do not be disturbed by the question of Bezalel,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud the early generations produced children at the age of eight. If this is the case then it is possible for all of the above to have taken place in 22 years: namely, Er was married in the ninth year after Joseph’s sale. A year later Onan married. Tamar then stayed for many days in her father’s house. We can interpret many days to mean a year. Eight years later Perez gave birth to a son and a year later to a second one. Thus it is possible for all that is reported in Chap. 38 to have taken place between the sale of Joseph and the descent into Egypt.<br>The Talmud concludes from the account of Bezalel that the early generations had children at the age of eight We read in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 69b: “Whence do we know that the first generations produced children at eight years? This is to be inferred from the following: <i>Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah</i> (Ex. 35:30), and it is written:..<i>And Caleb (the son of Hezron) took unto him Ephrath, who bore him Hur. And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel</i> (I Chron. 2:19, 20). When Bezalel was engaged in building the Tabernacle he was at least 13 years old as it is written, <i>came every man from his work which they wrought</i> (Ex. 36:4) and one is not called a man before the age of 13. And there is a Baraitha which states: The first year Moses prepared all that was necessary for the Tabernacle, and in the second year he erected it and sent the spies. And it is written: <i>And Caleb the son of Jephunneh said…Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea</i> (Josh. 14:6, 7) Now deduct 14, the age of Bezalel, from the age of Caleb when he was sent as a spy and there remains 26. Deduct two years for the three pregnancies with Uri and Hur and Bezalel, and there remains 24. Hence each of them produced children at the age of 8.” It should be noted that the above is based on identifying Caleb ben Hezron (I Chron. 2:18-20) as Caleb ben Jephunneh (Josh. 14:6, 7). However, according to I.E. these two Calebs were not the same. Hence, the entire Talmudic passage quoted above is Aggadic and not in keeping with the plain meaning of the text.</i> for I will explain it when I come to it.

Verse 2

Some say that <i>kena’ani</i> (Canaanite) means a merchant,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The commentators were bothered by Judah marrying a Canaanite woman.

However, it is possible that the word <i>kena’ani</i> is to be taken literally.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">It means a Canaanite.</i> Our sages said, <i>that Judah went down</i> (v. 1) means that Judah was demoted from his leadership.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">He thus went down from his exalted position.

WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT FORTH.

Verse 26

FORASMUCH AS I GAVE HER NOT. The expression <i>ki al ken</i> (for as much) has the same meaning as the Rabbinic term <i>ho’il</i> (since), as in <i>forasmuch</i> (ki al ken) <i>as I have seen thy face</i> (Gen. 33:10).

Verse 2

The fact that the <i>samekh</i> of <i>sarisav</i> (his officers) retains its <i>kamatz</i> is proof that the <i>resh</i> of <i>saris</i> (officer) should have received a <i>dagesh</i>, and since it cannot the <i>samekh</i> was vocalized with a long <i>kamatz</i> to compensate for the missing <i>dagesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Words vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath their first letter in the singular are vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> under their first letter in the plural; i.e., <i>nagid</i> becomes <i>negidim</i>. <i>Saris</i> does not follow this rule. Its plural is <i>sarisim</i>, not <i>serisim</i>. Hence the word presents a problem. I.E. suggests that <i>saris</i> belongs to the group of nouns vocalized <i>pattach-chirik</i>. The latter retain their <i>pattach</i> in the plural; i.e., <i>kabbir</i> becomes <i>kabbirim</i>. I.E. points out that <i>saris</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>samekh</i> but due to the fact that a <i>resh</i> cannot receive a <i>dagesh</i> (a <i>dagesh</i> usually follows a <i>pattach</i>), the <i>samekh</i> was vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> to compensate for the missing <i>dagesh</i>.

AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD CHARGED. When these two officers were put in a ward in the house of the captain of the guard, the latter remembered (<i>pakad</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In this interpretation <i>va-yifkod</i> (charged) is translated as remembered.

Filwarg interprets: remembered the Jospeh episode, i.e., that Joseph, like the butler and the baker, offended his master.

The Hebrew reading of I.E. is <i>zakhar devarav</i>.</i> and brought him to his house<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation Joseph was originally in a different prison and was now brought to the one in the home of the captain of the guard.</i> and placed him in a dungeon<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. verse 15.</i> which is the ward spoken of in our verse. The latter is the opinion of the great grammarian.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah Ibn Janah.</i> However, I believe that the prison was in the house of the captain of the guard and Joseph was there to begin with.

There was no nonsensical part in the dream. Every part of the dream had a meaning and was interpretable (Filwarg based on the reading of I.E. quoted by Nahmanides which is borne out by <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38). Our printed texts read, “Each one saw the interpretation of the dream and what happened to him” The problem with this reading is, if they saw the interpretation of their dream in their nocturnal vision why, then, did they turn to Joseph for its interpretation? Hence we have translated according to <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i>

Verse 6

Verse 8

[DO NOT INTERPRETATIONS BELONG TO GOD.] Its meaning is that the interpretations of dreams belong to the Lord because He knows the future.

Since this is so, and all interpretations belong to God, do not be concerned about telling me your dreams.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The point is, only God knows the future and what He knows will come to pass.

AND PRESSED THEM. <i>Va-eschat</i> (pressed) is similar to <i>shochate</i> (slay) in <i>That slay</i> (shochate) <i>the children in the valleys</i> (Is. 57:5). Saadiah Gaon’s interpretation of <i>va-eschat</i> is wrong.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is a very difficult comment to unravel. The most acceptable interpretation is offered by Filwarg. According to Filwarg, I.E. maintains that <i>va-eschat</i> does not mean to press or squeeze as Saadiah Gaon says (this interpretation is accepted by J.P.S. and all others) since the word is not found elsewhere in the Bible. The word <i>sachat</i>, meaning to squeeze, is found in Rabbinic literature, but there it is spelled with a <i>samakh</i> and not with a <i>sin</i>. I.E. notes that the word <i>shachat</i> spelled with a <i>shin</i> or <i>sachat</i> spelled with a <i>sin</i> as in our verse means the same, to cut, hence to slay by cutting the throat. Thus our verse should be rendered: And I cut the grape so that its juice ran. It is also possible that in I.E.’s copy of Isaiah <i>shochate</i> was spelled with a <i>sin</i>, i.e., he read <i>sochate</i>, and what I.E. is doing is noting that <i>va-eschat</i> is like <i>sochate</i>. For additional interpretations see Cherez and Weiser.</i>

Verse 12

THE INTERPRETATION OF IT. <i>Pitrono</i> (the interpretation of it) means its explanation.

According to Krinsky the question raised in I.E. is not answered. The way Krinsky read I.E. is: I.E. asks, “How did Joseph know that the three branches refer to three days?” He then goes on to explain the meaning of the clause <i>yom hulledet et paroh</i>.</i> possibly means the day on which Pharaoh was born.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph knew that Pharaoh’s birthday would be in three days and it was obvious to him that the branches referred to this festive event (Filwarg, Weiser, Cherez).</i> For today there are kings who make a party on their birthday and invite their servants and distribute gifts to them. It is also possible that the queen was pregnant.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">And that <i>yom hulledet et paroh</i> means the day that a child was born to Pharaoh.

Verse 13

SHALL PHARAOH LIFT UP THY HEAD. <i>Yissa</i> means shall lift up.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh will raise the chief butler from his fallen state.</i> In its correct sense, <i>yissa</i> means to lift up by counting. <sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See note 25.</i> Proof of this is Scripture stating, <i>and he lifted up</i> (va-yissa) <i>the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants</i> (v. 20).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Here the term <i>va-yissa</i> must mean and he counted because Pharaoh did not exalt the chief baker.</i> I will explain this term in my comments on the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i> (Ex. 30:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In his short commentary on Ex. 30:12, I.E. points out that one who counts people lists them in a row and places the most important at the top. Thus when Pharaoh will count his servants he will have a list of his butlers and bakers made. The name of the chief butler will head the list of butlers and that of the baker the list of bakers. Thus to “lift up” means to count. However, it does so only in a specific sense. It is not a mere synonym for counting. It should be noted that some commmentaries maintain that I.E. is of the opinion that to lift up is another way of saying to count. Cf. Krinsky and Cherez.</i>

EARS OF CORN. <i>Shibbolim</i> (ears of corn) is a feminine plural even though it ends in a <i>mem</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Which ordinarily indicates that a word is a masculine plural.</i> It is similar to <i>nashim</i> (women) and <i>pilagshim</i> (concubines).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Both of which are feminine plural nouns with masculine endings.</i>

Verse 6

AND BLASTED. <i>U-shedufot kadim</i> means they were blasted by a wind coming from the east for <i>kadim</i> means east. East is so termed because the sun rises there first.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kedem</i> means first. Cf. Is. 23:7; Ezek. 38:17. I.E. makes this point because <i>kedem</i> can also mean front. However, a circular object (the earth) has no front (Krinsky). <i>Shedufot kadim</i> can be rendered as blasted by the east. Hence I.E. points out that east refers to an east wind.</i>

Verse 7

<i>Ha-mele’ot</i> (full) has the same meaning as <i>ha-beri’ot</i> (rank).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5 reads <i>beri’ot ve-tovot</i> (rank and good). Similarly verse 7 reads, <i>ha-beri’ot ve-ha-mele’ot</i> (rank and full). I.E. points out that <i>beri’ot</i> when referring to ears of corn means full because the term <i>bari</i> (rank), which means fat, can only be used when referring to animals; i.e., one cannot speak of a fat plant. Hence I.E. points out that here <i>bari</i> means full (Filwarg). Thus <i>beri’ot ve-tovot</i> means the same as <i>mele’ot ve-tovot</i>. On the other hand I.E.’s comment may pertain only to verse 7. In this case I.E. is pointing out that the Bible there uses two synonyms, <i>mele’ot</i> and <i>beri’ot</i>, for full (Weiser).</i>

Verse 8

THAT HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED. <i>Va-tippa’em</i> (was troubled) is a <i>nifal</i>. It is similar to <i>nifamti</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a <i>nifal</i>. The <i>nun</i> of the <i>nifal</i> is missing in <i>va-tippa’em</i> because it is an imperfect with a conversive <i>vav</i>, and the <i>nun</i> of the <i>nifal</i> is dropped in the future and is compensated by a <i>dagesh</i> in the first letter of the root.</i> in <i>I am troubled</i> (nifamti) <i>and cannot speak</i> (Ps. 77:5). Others say<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The “others” do not dispute what has been said until now. They explain the meaning of the word, whereas the first interpretation gave the conjugation of the word (Cherez).</i> that both <i>va-tippa’em</i> and <i>nifamti</i> come from the same root as <i>pa’am</i> (anvil)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>va-tippa’em rucho</i> (that his spirit was troubled) thus is: that his spirit was beaten.</i> in <i>that smiteth the anvil</i> (pa’am) (Is. 41:7). Its meaning is that his spirit was like a beaten body.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It was pained and troubled. Spirit is immaterial and cannot be beaten. However, it may be compared to a beaten body. His spirit was beaten as if it were a body (Weiser). Hence the verb <i>va-tippa’em</i> (was beaten) can govern <i>rucho</i> (his spirit).</i>
MAGICIANS OF. <i>Chartume</i> (magicians of) comes from a quadriliteral root.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Its root being <i>chet, resh, tet, mem</i>.</i> However, it is possibly an Aramaic or Egyptian word. It means a scientist.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser.</i>

Verse 9

MY FAULTS. Even though I will recall my faults.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It is not fitting to recall one’s offenses before the king. Nevertheless, in this case I must (Krinsky). I will tell you of an interpreter, even though I have to recall my faults (Cohen).</i>

Verse 10

PHARAOH WAS WROTH WITH HIS SERVANTS. I believe that Pharaoh is an adjective<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">What I.E. means by “adjective” is an adjectival noun, a descriptive term like <i>melekh</i> (king). Cf.

It is a title as Hiram in Tyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., Hiram is not a proper noun. It is a term like Pharaoh or <i>melekh</i>. We thus find a Hiram in the days of David (II Sam. 5:11) and in the days of Solomon (I Kings 5:15) (Krinsky).</i> Similarly in our day all great Arab kings are called “prince of the believers.” Hence we find a Pharaoh in the days of Abraham and a Pharaoh in the days of Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">They obviously were not the same person.</i> We also read that a Pharaoh died and a new Pharaoh arose.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 1:8.</i> Similarly we find a Pharaoh in the days of Jeremiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 44:30.</i> Do you not see that Scripture itself explains that Pharaoh is a term for the king of Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible in a number of places explains that Pharaoh is a king of Egypt. Cf. Ex. 6:13, 29; Jer. 44:30. Filwarg questions this reading and suggests emending it. According to Filwarg we should translate, “Do you not see that Scripture does not explain the term Pharaoh. It does not do so because Pharaoh is a title for the kings of Egypt.” According to Filwarg, I.E.’s point is that the Bible usually does not identify the Pharaoh because it is known to be a title for the king of Egypt. If Pharaoh was a proper name, king of Egypt would follow it.</i> as evidenced by the terms Pharaoh Hophra and Pharaoh Neco,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 44:30; 46:2.</i> wherein Hophra and Neco are proper nouns.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore Pharaoh must be an adjective.</i> Do not raise any objection from the Midrash concerning Solomon’s throne,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash, <i>Va-yikra Rabbah</i> 20, Pharaoh Neco means Pharaoh the lame. Thus <i>Neco</i> is an adjective. According to the Midrash this Pharaoh tried to sit on Solomon’s throne, which had been brought to Egypt by an earlier Pharaoh named Shishak, and had his leg bitten and broken by a lion, hence the name Pharaoh Neco, Pharaoh the lame.</i> for the king of Egypt did not take it to Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">King Solomon’s throne was never brought to Egypt as it is not included among the spoil taken by Shishak. Cf.

ME AND THE CHIEF BAKER. The word me is mentioned twice in this verse in keeping with Hebrew usage. Compare, <i>and as for me, whither shall I go</i> (Gen. 37:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 37:30 and the notes thereto.

Verse 12



Verse 13

I WAS RESTORED. By Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads: me he restored (<i>oti heshiv</i>), him he hanged (<i>oto talah</i>). The question is, to whom does “he” refer. According to the first interpretation it refers to Pharaoh, according to the second, to Joseph.</i> Or its meaning is, Joseph’s word<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since Joseph said it, it was as if he had done it (Filwarg). Or Joseph’s saying it was the cause of it (Krinsky).</i> or Joseph’s interpretation restored me and hanged him.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph, by so interpreting, caused it to happen (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 14

AND THEY BROUGHT HIM HASTILY. Pharaoh’s messengers.
AND HE SHAVED HIMSELF. Someone shaved him.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>va-yegakkach</i>. If Joseph shaved himself Scripture would have used the <i>hitpa’el va-yitgallach</i> rather than the <i>pi’el va-yegallach</i> (Cherez), the meaning of which is, and he shaved. However, <i>va-yegallach</i> presents a problem. The subject is missing. Hence I.E. notes that it should be rendered: and someone shaved him. According to Krinsky, I.E. is of the opinion (for the aforementioned reasons) that our verse is abridged and the reader has to supply the subject. Our verse should thus be rendered: and the shaver shaved him. I.E.’s note consists of one word, <i>ha-megalle’ach</i> (the shaver).</i>

Verse 15



Verse 16

IT IS NOT IN ME. <i>Biladai</i> (it is not in me) is a compound of two words.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">It is a compound of <i>bal</i> (not) and <i>ade</i> (unto).</i> <i>It is not in me</i> refers to <i>And I have heard say of thee that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it</i> (v. 15). When Joseph heard Pharaoh say this he replied, <i>it is not in me, but God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace via my interpretation</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The problem is what does <i>biladai</i> (it is not in me) refer to. According to this explanation <i>biladai</i> refers to the power to interpret dreams. The power to interpret dreams is not in me, it comes from God (Cherez).</i> Others say that when Joseph heard Pharaoh say, <i>thou canst interpret dreams</i>, Jospeh replied, I am not (it is not in me) the interpreter; God is, and He will give the king an answer of peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>biladai</i> means not I, and refers to the interpreter (Cherez). It should be noted that I.E. is vague and that Krinsky, Kaputa and others interpret differently.</i>
[WILL GIVE AN ANSWER.] The meaning of <i>ya’aneh</i> (will give an answer) is, He will always provide. Compare, <i>ma’aneh</i> in <i>for God answereth him</i> (ma’aneh) <i>in the joy of his heart</i> (Eccles. 5:19), and <i>ta’aneh</i> in <i>And the earth shall respond</i> (ta’aneh) (Hos. 2:24). Nevertheless, the word is close to its primary meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Its primary meaning is to answer. When one provides, he, as it were, answers (Cherez). For an alternate translation see Weiser.</i> 

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

[POOR AND VERY ILL-FAVORED.] In relating the dream Pharaoh added the word <i>dallot</i> (poor), and in place of <i>mareh</i> (favored) he used the term <i>to’ar</i> (favored) because their meanings are similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 3 we read that Pharaoh saw <i>ill-favored</i> (ra’ot mareh) <i>and lean fleshed</i> kine in his dream. In our verse Pharaoh describes them as <i>poor and very ill-favored</i> (ve-ra’ot to’ar me’od) <i>and lean fleshed</i>. I.E. says there is no discrepancy in the descriptions because adding a word or using a synonym does not change the meaning. He further expands on this point in his comments on Ex. 20:1 where he uses this argument to explain why there are two different versions of the Ten Commandments in the Pentateuch.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

BUT THEY WERE STILL ILL-FAVORED. Each one of the kine was ill-favored.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Marehen</i> (favored) is a plural; <i>ra</i> (ill) is a singular. Thus <i>marehen ra</i> is a combination of singular and plural. I.E. explains this by noting that it means each one of the kine was ill-favored. This is how the medieval grammarians explained this type of combination (Weiser).</i> Here Pharaoh expanded in his description of his dream and added that after the ill-favored kine had eaten the fat kine, <i>they were still ill-favored as at the beginning</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">When the dream was first described in verse 4, it was not indicated that after swallowing the seven fat kine, the seven lean ones <i>were still ill-favored as at the beginning</i>. Here, unlike verse 19, the addition is significant. The entire verse consists of Pharaoh’s elaboration of his dream.</i>

Verse 22



Verse 23

WITHERED. The word <i>tzenumot</i> (withered) is not found elsewhere in Scripture. Its meaning is the same as that of <i>rekot</i> (empty).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph in verse 27 refers to the ears as <i>rekot</i> (empty). In our verse they are described as <i>tzenumot</i>. According to I.E., Joseph substituted a synonym. I.E. explains these substitutions in his comments on verse 19.</i> Others say that <i>tzenumot</i> means images,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In a manner of speaking images are imitations. Similarly applying this concept these things were in the shape of ears but empty on the inside (Krinsky). Or images have no practical use, neither did these ears (Cherez). Weiser suggests that what I.E. says is that images are hard; these, too, were hard and could not serve as food. According to the latter interpretation I.E. agrees with Rashi who interprets <i>tzenumot</i> as hard.</i> for that is its meaning in Arabic.

Verse 29

GREAT PLENTY. <i>Sava</i> (plenty) is a noun. It is like <i>ra’av</i> (famine).<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Both <i>sava</i> and <i>ra’av</i> are nouns.</i> Hence the one who says in his Sabbath prayers<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>nishmat</i> prayer.</i> <i>u-ve-sova kilkaltanu</i> errs because <i>sova</i> spelled with a <i>vav</i> is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer reads, <i>during famine</i> (ra’av) <i>thou didst feed us, and didst sustain us in plenty</i> (p. 419, <i>The Authorized Prayer Book</i>, trans. by J. H. Hertz). Plenty is parallel to famine. As <i>ra’av</i> is a noun so its parallel must be a noun. Hence the correct reading is <i>sava</i> and not <i>sova</i>.</i> The correct way to read this prayer is without a <i>vav</i>, viz., <i>u-ve-sava</i> (and in plenty) <i>kilkaltanu</i> (thou sustained us).

Verse 30



Verse 31

[AND THE PLENTY SHALL NOT BE KNOWN IN THE LAND.] Joseph based this on <i>but they were still ill-favored as at the beginning</i> (v. 21).

Verse 32

AND FOR THAT THE DREAM WAS DOUBLED. <i>Hishanot</i> (was doubled) is a <i>nifal</i>. It comes from the same root as <i>shenayim</i> (two). Its meaning is the dream coming twice, once with kine as its symbol and then with ears of corn as its symbol, also attests<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Not only do the kine and the ears allude to seven years of plenty and famine, they also indicate that the decree is established by God; i.e., it is unchangeable.</i> that <i>the thing is established by God</i>. Furthermore, the occurrence of the two dreams in one night is proof that <i>God will shortly bring it to pass</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The dream could have come on two different nights. The fact that it occurred twice in one night is proof that God is bringing it about soon. Our verse reads: <i>The dream was doubled…twice</i>. This appears redundant; hence I.E. explains <i>was doubled</i> came in two versions, <i>twice</i>, twice in one night. <i>It is because the thing is established by God</i> corresponds to <i>was doubled</i>; and <i>and God will shortly bring it to pass</i> corresponds to <i>twice</i>.</i>

Verse 33



Verse 34

LET PHARAOH DO THIS. <i>Ya’aseh paro</i> (literally let Pharaoh do) is short for let Pharaoh do according to the following council. Or <i>ya’aseh</i> (do) means get, like <i>asah</i> in <i>My power and the might of my hand hath gotten</i> (asah) <i>me this wealth</i> (Deut. 8:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>ya’aseh paro</i> means let Pharoah get.

Verse 35

AND LAY UP CORN. The overseers. Some say that <i>bar</i> (corn) refers to corn in its ears.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Grain that has not been purified from its stubble (Weiser).</i> However, I think that <i>bar</i> is the term applied to the corn after it has been fanned and cleansed.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Grain whose impurities have been removed. I.E. is paraphrasing Jer. 4:11. Our texts read, fanned or cleansed. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, fanned and cleansed.

Verse 38

CAN WE FIND SUCH A ONE AS THIS. <i>Nimtza</i> (we find) is a <i>nifal</i> perfect and the meaning of <i>ha-nimtza kha-zeh ish</i> (can we find such a one as this) is, was such a one as this ever found in the world. It is also possible that the <i>nun</i> of <i>nimtza</i> is a first person plural prefix.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>nun</i> is prefixed to the Hebrew root in the first person plural imperfect.

The point is that <i>nimtza</i> can either be a third person singular <i>nifal</i> perfect or a first person plural <i>kal</i> imperfect.

Verse 40

THOU SHALT BE OVER MY HOUSE. Thou shalt be chief over my house.

Krinsky suggests translating it, thy word shall all my people kiss. Literally, <i>pikha</i> means thy mouth.</i> However, the latter is far fetched.
ONLY IN THE THRONE WILL I BE GREATER THAN THOU. It is known that <i>egdal</i> (I will be greater) is an intransitive verb. The meaning of <i>rak ha-kisse egdal mi-mekka</i> is, I will not be greater than you except for the dignity of the throne.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Egdal</i> being intransitive refers to Pharaoh and not the throne.</i> The word <i>gedelani</i> (he grew up with me) in <i>Nay from my youth he grew up with me</i> (gedelani) <i>as with a father</i> (Job 31:18) is not a transitive verb<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, brought me up. If <i>gedelani</i> was transitive it would disprove I.E.’s contention that <i>egdal</i> is intransitive since they are both <i>kals</i>.</i> but an intransitive verb meaning he grew up with me.

Verse 43

THE SECOND. <i>Mishneh</i> (the second) comes from the same root as <i>shenayim</i> (two).

CHARIOT. A wooden chariot pulled by four horses,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Some interpret <i>mirkevet</i> (chariot) to mean a horse or mule. Cf.

The reference therefore must be to Jer. 25:3 (speaking betimes and often) where the word for betimes is written <i>ashkem</i> with an <i>alef</i>.

FOR GOD HATH MADE ME FORGET.

Similarly <i>nashani</i> comes from the root <i>nun, shin, shin</i>.

Compare, <i>tzivvani</i> whose root is <i>tzadi, vav, heh</i>. The problem is that the first letter of a <i>pi’el</i> perfect is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>, and <i>nashani</i> is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>, hence Rabbi Moses’ explanation that a <i>pattach</i> has been substituted for a <i>chirik</i>. Thus <i>nashani</i> is a variant of <i>nishani</i>.</i>

Verse 56

AND JOSEPH OPENED ALL. The storehouses which they had.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads: And Joseph opened what was <i>ba-hem</i> (in them). I.E. interprets <i>ba-hem</i> to mean, had with them, i.e., their storehouses.</i>

Hence Joseph sold it. Thus <i>va-yishbor</i> means, and he sold (Krinsky). <i>Va-yishbor</i> usually means, and he bought corn. This is the sense in which this root is used throughout Chap. 42 and in Is. 55:1. However, here <i>va-yishbor</i> seems to mean, and he sold corn. I.E.’s apparent solution to the problem is to explain that <i>va-yishbor</i> can apply either to the seller or to the buyer as the transfer of corn (<i>shever</i>) is effectuated by two individuals, the one giving (selling) the corn and the other buying it. The aforementioned is how Kimchi explains <i>va-yishbor</i> and it appears to be the meaning of I.E.’s comment (Cherez).</i>

Verse 57

WHY DO YOU LOOK ONE UPON ANOTHER. <i>Lammah titra</i>’u (why do you look one upon another) means, don’t show yourselves as having an abundance of food.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi, “Why do you show yourselves before the children of Ishmael and the children of Esau as having plenty to eat?” Why do you show yourselves is thus short for, why do you show yourselves as having an abundance of food.</i> Or it may mean, do not quarrel with each other, as in <i>Come, let us look one another</i> (nitra’eh) <i>in the face</i> (II Chron. 25:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. translates <i>nitra’eh</i> in II Chron. 25:17 as fight. Thus the root <i>resh, alef, heh</i> which usually means to see, at times also means to fight or quarrel. Hence <i>titra</i>’u is similar to <i>nitra’eh</i>, i.e., it means to quarrel.</i>

Verse 2

ROUGHLY. <i>Kashot</i> (roughly) is an adjective. Its meaning is rough words.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The word “words” has to be added to the text Thus rough (<i>kashot</i>) is short for rough words (Weiser).

Verse 9

THE NAKEDNESS OF THE LAND. Nakedness is a figure of speech for shame, since it is customary to hide one’s nakedness because of its unseemliness.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Nakedness thus means shame. Weiser takes I.E.’s comment at face value and explains that shame refers to the shame of the country. Cherez explains that shame refers to the areas of the country open to invasion. Be that as it may, according to this interpretation, the nakedness of the land means the shame of the land.</i> Or nakedness refers to secrets, since one’s nakedness is covered. Joseph thus said to them, “You have come to learn the secrets of the land.” I prefer the latter interpretation.

UPRIGHT. <i>Kenim</i> means truthful.

IS YOUR FATHER WELL, THE OLD MAN.

His solution is to suggest that <i>ha-shalom avikhem</i> is short for <i>ha-shalom la avikhem</i>.</i> It is abridged, and should be read as if written, <i>ha-shalom la-avikhem</i> (is your father in peace). <i>Ve-attah shalom</i> (and peace be unto thee) (I Sam. 25:6) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I Sam. 25:6 reads, <i>ve-attah shalom</i>.

Hence here, too, the verse is abridged and should be read as if written <i>ve-attah shalom lekha</i>.</i>

Verse 28

AND THEY BOWED THE HEAD. <i>Va-yikkedu</i> (and they bowed the head) means, and they placed their head to the ground.

[CLEAR OURSELVES.] There is a <i>tet</i> in place of the <i>tav</i> of the <i>hitpa’el</i> conjugation in the word <i>nitztaddak</i> (clear ourselves) because the first root letter is a <i>tzadi</i>.
GOD HAS FOUND OUT THE INIQUITY OF THY SERVANTS. They spoke by way of parable.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Found implies that God was unaware of the sin till the present, and he now found it.

Verse 12

THAT IT IS MY MOUTH. It is well known that <i>peh</i> (mouth) spelled <i>peh, heh</i> is in the absolute.

[ALL THE SOULS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB, THAT CAME INTO EGYPT, WERE THREESCORE AND TEN.] An exegate says that <i>three score and ten</i> is a round number, since in fact they numbered sixty-nine.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The names of Jacob’s descendants listed in our chapter come to 69, not 70.</i> However, this commentator erred, since we find Scripture stating, with regard to Leah’s offspring who numbered thirty-two, <i>all the souls of his sons and daughters were thirty and three</i> (v. 15). <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 8-14 list the children of Leah and their offspring. Thirty-two individuals are listed by name. However, in giving their total Scripture says they were thirty-three. Now 70 is a round number with regard to 69. However, 33 is not a round number with regard to 32. It should be noted that it is the one person missing from the list of Leah’s offspring that is missing from our list of 70; i.e., if Leah’s thirty-three were listed here, we would have 70.</i> The Midrash tries to solve the problem by saying that Jochebed was born between the ramparts when they entered Egypt. <sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Baba Batra</i> 123a-b. The point being that when Jacob was going down to Egypt, Jochebed was yet in her mother’s womb and could not be counted as a person. However, as soon as the Israelites come to Egypt she was born. Hence 70 descendants of Jacob came to Egypt.</i> However, this, too, presents a problem, viz., why doesn’t Scripture record the great wonder of Jochebed giving birth to Moses when she was one hundred and thirty years old?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to Talmudic tradition the Israelites were in Egypt for 210 years (<i>Seder Olam</i>). Moses was 80 at the time of the Exodus (Ex. 7:7); thus Moses was born 130 years after the descent into Egypt. If his mother was born at the beginning of the descent then she had to be 130 years old at the time of Moses’ birth.</i> Furthermore, why does Scripture note that Sarah was ninety when she bore a son?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">When the Torah doesn’t see fit to note that Jochebed was 130 when she brought a child into the world.</i> And as if we didn’t have enough problems with the above, the liturgical poets composed a hymn for Simchat Torah reading, <i>Jochebed my mother will be comforted after me</i> thereby indicating that Jochebed was two hundred and fifty years old at the time of Moses’ death.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If this is really so, why wasn’t Jochebed’s longevity mentioned in Scripture?</i> As to the Midrash which states that Ahijah the Shilonite lived for hundreds of years,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Baba Batra</i> 121b and <i>Seder Olam</i> 1. There it is stated that the prophet Ahijah, who prophesied during the reign of King Jeroboam, saw Amram the father of Moses. Ahijah thus lived close to 600 years. This is therefore a greater miracle than that of Jochebed, and yet Scripture doesn’t mention it. Hence this Midrash can serve as support for the liturgical poets that Scripture omits certain miracles (Cherez). Krinsky explains that the liturgical poets can argue that if Ahijah could live 600 years, why is it hard to believe that Jochebed was still alive at the time of Moses’ death?</i> it is an aggadic statement or an individual opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It is therefore not binding and cannot be offered as proof.</i> I believe that the way to solve our problem is by recognizing the fact that the Bible includes Jacob among the seventy who came into Egypt and starts the count of the seventy from him. The verse (15) is to be interpreted as if it read: all the souls of his sons and his daughters plus himself were thirty-three. Proof that this is the way to interpret this verse is that Scripture previously states, <i>And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons</i> (v. 8).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Jacob is included in the number of those who came to Egypt.</i> Should one argue and say, “Does not Scripture explicitly state, <i>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls</i> (Ex. 1:5)?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob obviously cannot be included in those that came out of his loins.</i> Know that Scripture isn’t concerned with noting that one of the seventy did not come from Jacob’s loins, as it didn’t bother to leave out Benjamin when it said, <i>These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram</i> (Gen. 35:26), even though Benjamin was not born there. We have two proofs in our own Torah portion that this is the style of Scripture. First, the Pentateuch states, <i>And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons</i> (v. 8). The Torah thus includes Jacob among the sons of Israel. It does so because Scripture speaks of the majority of those who came to Egypt. Secondly, Scripture states, <i>all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were three score and ten</i> (Gen. 46:27). However, Manasseh and Ephraim did not come into Egypt, they were there to begin with, having been born in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Yet Scripture lists them among those who came to Egypt (v. 20).</i> In the same vein another verse<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i> reads, <i>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with three score and ten souls</i> (Deut. 10:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nefesh</i> has been translated as souls, in keeping with I.E.’s translation.</i> However, as noted, Manasseh and Ephraim did not go down to Egypt. This verse<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is either to verse 27 (Krinsky) or both verse 27 and Deut. 10:22 (Cherez), or possibly only to Deut. 10:22.</i> is also proof that Jacob is counted among the seventy, for he had a soul<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were three score and ten</i>. Since Jacob had a soul he is included in the souls that came into Egypt and similarly with Deut. 10:22.</i> and he was the most important of them all.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is unlikely that he would not be included in the number of those that went down (Weiser).</i>

WAS ALL SPENT. <i>Va-yittom</i> (was all spent) comes from a root whose second and third letters are identical.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>tav, mem, mem</i> and it is a <i>kal</i> (Filwarg).</i> It is similar to <i>va-yiddom</i> (stood still) in <i>And the sun stood still</i> (va-yiddom) (Josh. 10:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>dalet, mem, mem</i>.

Verse 16

GIVE. According to the rules of Hebrew grammar the <i>heh</i> of <i>havu</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>chataf pattach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>havu</i> is <i>yod, heh, bet</i>. Such a word drops its first root letter in the plural masculine imperative and its second root letter is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>. Compare, <i>yada</i> and <i>yatza</i> which in the imperative plural masculine become <i>de</i>’u and <i>tze</i>’u. Thus <i>havu</i> should have a <i>chataf pattach</i> beneath the <i>heh</i>. However, it does not. The <i>heh</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>. It is therefore irregular.</i>
IF MONEY FAIL. <i>Afes</i> (fail) is a perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A third person perfect is usually vocalized <i>kamatz, pattach</i>. However, some words are conjugated according to the paradigm of <i>pa’el</i>. These words are vocalized <i>kamatz, tzere</i> both in the third person masculine perfect and in the present tense. Thus <i>afes</i> can either be a perfect or a participle, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is similar to the word <i>yare</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See above note.

Verse 19

[WHEREFORE SHOULD WE DIE…BOTH WE AND OUR LAND.] One should not be surprised that the Bible employs the term death to the land. We also find the reverse in <i>Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon…and Thou givest them all life</i> (Neh. 9:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. In this verse we find life, which is the opposite of death, applied to heaven and earth.</i>
BE NOT DESOLATE. <i>Tesham</i> (be desolate) comes from the same root as <i>tishamenah</i> in <i>and the high places shall be desolate</i> (tishamenah) (Ezek. 6:6). <i>Tesham</i> follows the paradigm of <i>teda</i> (she will know).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the root of <i>tesham</i> is <i>yod, shin, mem</i> (Filwarg). The <i>yod</i> drops out and the letters prefixed to the root which indicate that the word is an imperfect are vocalized with a <i>tzere</i>, as in the case of the imperfect of the word <i>yada</i> from the root <i>yod, dalet, ayin</i>.</i> The Midrash tells us that the hunger ceased because of Jacob’s merit.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 89:11. See also <i>Tosephta, Sotah</i> 10, “Before Jacob came down to Egypt there was a famine there…after he came there Scripture tells us, <i>Then Joseph said unto the people…Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings</i> (Gen. 47:23-24), which indicates that the famine ceased.”</i> However, it is possible that the hunger lasted for seven years but that it was less intense in the final three years than during the first four years.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. wants to reconcile the Midrash with Joseph’s prophecy that there would be seven years of hunger. He does so by accepting the fact that there were seven years of hunger and interprets the Midrashic statement as meaning that the hunger eased. It should be noted that <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 has the reading: “The Midrash tells us that the hunger ceased because of Jacob’s merit. This is possible. It is also possible that the hunger continued during the last three years of the famine but that it was less intense than during the first four years.” According to Weiser, I.E. is of the opinion that Joseph’s collection of the money (v. 14 and 15); of the cattle (v. 16 and 17); and of buying the land (v. 18 and 19) took place successively during the last three years of the famine and that it eased during these years. For another interpretation see Filwarg, Weiser and Krinsky.</i>

Verse 21

AND AS FOR THE PEOPLE, HE REMOVED THEM. He uprooted each and every Egyptian from his place.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>ve-et ha-am he-evir oto le-arim</i> (And as for the people, he removed them city by city). <i>Am</i> (people) is a plural. <i>Oto</i> (him) is a singular, hence I.E.’s interpretation (Krinsky). This is the way I.E. explains the combination of singulars and plurals.</i> Some say that Scripture speaks of the people of Egypt’s main city. Joseph removed them from the capital to villages so that they would till the soil.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-et ha-am he-evir oto le-arim</i> literally means: And as for the people, he removed them to the cities, hence I.E.’s second interpretation.</i>

Verse 30

BUT WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY FATHERS. This is a euphemism for death.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the verse reads, <i>But when I die (when I sleep with my fathers), thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place</i>.</i> Or it may mean: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt (v. 29), but I will sleep (be buried) with my fathers.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation, <i>ve-shakhavti im avotai</i> (but when I sleep with my fathers) means, but I will be buried with my fathers.</i> The latter will come to pass because thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>But when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place</i>. If <i>ve-shakhavti im avotai</i> (but when I sleep with my fathers) means I will be buried with my fathers, then the verse is redundant, hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i>

Verse 31

AND ISRAEL BOWED DOWN. He payed homage to Joseph because he held royal position. However, I believe it means he bowed to God in praise. Our verse is different from the verse which records the bowing of Abraham (Gen. 23:7), for in the latter case it is explicitly stated that Abraham bowed to the children of Heth.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 23:7 tells us that Abraham bowed before the children of Heth. Some interpret that verse to mean that Abraham bowed before God. I.E. on Gen. 23:6 rejects that interpretation on the grounds that Scripture explicitly states, <i>And Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth</i>. However, here Scripture does not explicitly state that Jacob bowed down to Joseph. Hence we may interpret that Jacob bowed to God. Cf. I.E.’s comments on Gen. 23:6 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 4

[BEHOLD, I WILL MAKE THEE FRUITFUL.] According to Saadiah Gaon Jacob told Joseph: God appeared to me and told me, <i>Behold I will make thee fruitful</i>. However, following this promise I had no other children, and Rachel died. I now know that the Divine promise of <i>Behold, I will make thee fruitful</i> was said concerning your children.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>Ephraim and Manasseh…shall be mine</i> (v. 5).</i> This interpretation is totally unpalatable. What difference is there between Joseph’s children and Reuben’s children?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">How did Jacob know the promise referred to Joseph’s children and not to Reuben’s children when both are his descendants and the Divine promise, <i>Behold, I will make thee fruitful</i> could apply to both?</i> Furthermore, Benjamin was born after this prophetic vision.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The vision in which God told Jacob, <i>Behold, I will make thee fruitful</i>, is recorded in Gen. 35:9-16. Benjamin’s birth follows immediately in verse 18.

I now give you a first born’s share<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since the land was given to me, I may pass it on as I see fit.</i> in this land. Therefore let Ephraim and Manasseh share in the land in the same manner as Reuben and Simeon, my two eldest sons (v. 5). However, any children that will be born to you in addition to Ephraim and Manasseh<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Viz., <i>And thy issue, that thou begettest after them</i>.

If his interpretation is correct, why does Scripture say, <i>they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance</i> (v. 6)?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Machir’s children received Machir’s share in the land.

If we cannot apply it to Joseph’s sons other than Manasseh and Ephraim, since he had no others, then the Bible must be referring to grandchildren.</i> It is not convincing. It is quite possible that Joseph had additional children but they are not mentioned because they received their inheritance among their brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since they were included in the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, there was no reason to mention them.</i> There are many other such instances in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Where names were left out because they had no significance.</i>

Verse 7

[AND AS FOR ME, WHEN I CAME FROM PADDAN.] Rachel died suddenly and I was not able to transport her to the cave of Machpelah and inter her there, as I did with Leah. Jacob told this to Joseph so that he would not be angry with him for requesting that he do for him what he didn’t do for his mother.

Verse 8

[AND ISRAEL BEHELD JOSEPH’S SONS.] After stating in our verse, <i>And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons</i>, how could Scripture go on to say, <i>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see</i> (v. 10)? The answer is, <i>so that he could not see</i> means he was not able to see clearly and recognize their faces.

The point being that Manesseh and Ephraim were between Joseph’s knees until the conclusion of the blessing. Hence our verse should have followed verse 20. However, the problem remains, why is this verse misplaced? Filwarg interprets I.E. as saying that Scripture first summarizes what transpired during the blessing and then goes into detail, that is, Scripture in verses 9-12 tells us that Joseph brought his children to Jacob and that Jacob placed them between his knees, kissed them and blessed them and that Joseph took them from between his knees, and bowed in gratitude before his father for blessing his children. Then in verses 13-20 the Bible tells us exactly what transpired during the blessing.</i>

AND JOSEPH TOOK THEM BOTH. Its meaning is: And Joseph had taken them both.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In other words <i>va-yikkach</i> (took) is a pluperfect that means had taken. In verse 9 we are told that Jacob told Joseph, <i>Bring them (your sons), I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them</i>. Verse 10, while stating that Jacob kissed them, does not state that Joseph brought them to his father. This is stated in verse 13. Filwarg in keeping with his interpretation of I.E., viz., that verses 9-12 summarize what happened and verses 13-20 tell in detail what occurred, interprets as follows: Scripture is about to relate the details of the blessing. It begins by telling that Joseph had brought his children to his father in the following manner, Ephraim in his right hand and Manasseh in his left hand.</i> I have already noted many other such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Of the pluperfect in Scripture.

Rachel was the one Jacob originally wanted to marry and the one whom he loved.

He also gave the birthright to Joseph because he was the first born of his true mate. When Reuben showed himself unfit for the birthright he transferred it to Joseph who was Rachel’s first born, rather than to Dan or Gad because they were sons of the handmaidens.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Dan was Bilhah’s first born (Gen. 30:6). Gad was Zilpah’s first born (Gen. 30:11). Jacob thus gave the birthright to Joseph even though Dan and Gad were older than Joseph and were first born.

ONE PORTION. Some say that <i>shekhem</i> (portion) alludes to the city of Shechem which was in the portion of the land allotted to Joseph. 
<i>With my sword and with my bow</i> refers to God, as in David’s statement, <i>The lord is my rock…My shield and my horn of salvation</i> (Ps. 18:3; II Sam. 22:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">That is, with the help of God, who is my sword and bow.</i> However, I believe that <i>shekhem</i> means a portion and <i>shekhem echad</i> is to be rendered one portion. The word <i>shekhem</i> is related to the words <i>shikhmam</i> (their shoulders) and <i>shekhem</i> (shoulder) in, <i>upon their shoulders</i> (shichmam) (Ex. 12:34), and <i>To serve Him with one consent</i> (shekhem echad) (Zeph. 3:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A portion is called a <i>shekhem</i> (shoulder) because the shoulder is a part of the body (Filwarg).</i>

Jacob’s statement, <i>Which I took</i>, presents no problems<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If Jacob was speaking of the future, why did he use the perfect <i>lakachti</i> (took)?</i> because the Patriarchs considered the land as theirs from the moment that God verbally gave it to Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Once God promised it to the patriarchs they were sure that they would inherit it.

Verse 1

THAT WHICH SHALL BEFALL YOU. Prophecies foretelling that which shall befall you in the future. Those who base themselves on Scripture’s closing remark, <i>and this is that their father spoke unto them and blessed them</i> (v. 28), and conclude that they (Jacob’s words) are blessings, err.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture concludes with <i>and this is that their father spoke unto them and blessed them</i> (v. 28), it implies that what precedes are blessings.</i> For if it were so, where are the blessings of Reuben, Simeon and Levi?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These three sons were castigated, not blessed.</i> The way to understand <i>and this is that their father spoke unto them and blessed them</i> is as follows: and this (v. 3-27) is what their father spoke unto them by way of prophecy after which he blessed them. Scripture omits the blessings.

Verse 2



Verse 3

REUBEN, THOU ART MY FIRST-BORN, MY MIGHT, AND THE FIRST-FRUITS OF MY STRENGTH. My might was first seen in thee. The first-born is called the first of one’s strength. We find an identical expression in <i>And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham</i> (Ps. 78:51).
THE EXCELLENCY OF DIGNITY. You were suited by virtue of being first-born for the advantage of being exalted above all your brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. translates <i>yeter se’et</i> (the excellency of dignity) as the advantage (<i>yeter</i>) of rank (<i>se’et</i>) and interprets accordingly. It should be noted that <i>se’et</i> comes from the root <i>nun, sin, alef</i>, meaning raised up or exalted.</i>
AND THE EXCELLENCY OF POWER. This means the same as <i>The excellency of dignity</i>. It is prophetic style to repeat the same idea in different words.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. translates our line: The advantage of rank / the advantage of power. The first in rank has dominion over those below him, hence power is parallel to rank and the advantage of power means the same as the advantage of rank. Modem scholars refer to this as synonymous parallelism. The latter is a feature of Biblical poetry.</i> The meaning of <i>oz</i> is power.

Verse 4

UNSTABLE. Because you acted unstably as water does.
HAVE NOT THOU THE EXCELLENCY. (Some say) that <i>al totar</i> (have not thou the excellency) means, you will not have the advantage.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation our line reads: Unstable as water / you will not have the advantage; i.e., because you acted unstably as water does, you will not have the advantage of rank and power.</i> However, if this were the case then our text should have read <i>al tutar</i> rather than <i>al totar</i>; i.e., the <i>vav</i> of <i>totar</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>shuruk</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Totar</i> is vocalized with a <i>cholam</i>. If <i>al totar</i> means you will not have the advantage then <i>totar</i> is a passive, i.e., a <i>hofal</i>, and should be written <i>tutar</i> and not <i>totar</i> which is a <i>hifil</i> and a causative. Cf. Filwarg.</i> Others say that our clause should be interpreted thus: you acted unstably as water that is poured out of a vessel and you gained nothing thereby (<i>al totar</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The advantage of this interpretation is that <i>totar</i> is not irregularly vocalized. <i>Al totar</i> is a <i>hifil</i> imperfect with the meaning of a perfect It literally means you will not gain. Here it means you did not gain anything; that is, you gained nothing by acting rashly. For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky.</i> However, I disagree with this interpretation. The term <i>al</i> is always used in Scripture as an imperative.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The point is <i>al totar</i> cannot be translated as you gained nothing because <i>al</i> is an imperative meaning don’t This comment also negates the first interpretation quoted by I.E. since there, too, <i>al</i> is not used as an imperative (Filwarg).</i> The latter fact is not negated by the fact that we find <i>al</i> used once in a non-imperative sense in <i>In the way of righteousness is life, And in the pathway thereof there is no</i> (al) <i>death</i> (Prov. 12:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that one irregular usage of <i>al</i> does not disprove his contention that <i>al</i> is always used as an imperative.</i> The correct translation of our clause is: do not seek any advantage (<i>al totar</i>) even one as insignificant as water.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In other words <i>al totar</i> means do not seek any advantage. This comment presents a problem. I.E. reads, “even one as insignificant as water (<i>afilu pachaz ka-mayim</i>).” This reading is extremely difficult since up to now I.E. explains <i>pachaz ka-mayim</i> as referring to Reuben’s action, not to Reuben’s punishment. Filwarg suggests deleting these words. Krinsky and Cherez emend <i>afilu</i> to <i>attah</i> (you). Weiser suggests that this comment has been misplaced and that its proper place is after Saadiah’s comment. In this case I.E. amplifies Saadiah’s explanation that <i>pachaz</i> means something insignificant. However, it appears that I.E. anticipated Saadiah’s interpretation of <i>pachaz ka-mayim</i>.</i> Accordingly the <i>vav</i> of <i>totar</i> is properly vocalized with a <i>cholam</i>, and it follows the paradigm of <i>tosaf</i> (more) in <i>Think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more</i> (al tosaf) (Job 40:32).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Totar</i> is a <i>hifil</i> and follows the paradigm of <i>tosaf</i> which is also a <i>hifil</i>. Since <i>tosaf</i> is a <i>hifil</i> the text should have read <i>tosef</i>. But as the word comes at the end of a verse the <i>tzere</i> changes to a <i>pattach</i>. Similarly <i>totar</i> should have been written <i>toter</i> but as it concludes a segment of a poetical line the <i>tzere</i> changes to a <i>pattach</i>. Cf. Rashi on Job 40:32 (Cherez). Thus <i>totar</i> is similar to <i>tosaf</i>.</i> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon explains our line as follows: you will not have any advantage over your brothers even one as insignificant as water. According to Saadiah <i>pachaz</i> (unstable) comes from the same root as <i>pochazim</i> (light, insignificant) in <i>vain and light</i> (pochazim) <i>fellows</i> (Judges 9:4), and the root of the word <i>pachaz</i> does not have to be inverted. <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As it must be if we interpret the word to mean unstable. <i>Pachaz</i> (unstable) comes from the root <i>chet, peh, zayin (chafaz</i>) which means to hurry. However, the root of <i>pachaz</i> is obviously <i>peh, chet, zayin</i>. By interpreting <i>pachaz</i> to mean unstable we are saying that we must invert the root <i>chet, peh, zayin</i> into <i>peh, chet, zayin</i>. However, according to Saadiah <i>pachaz</i> has its own root, <i>peh, chet, zayin</i>, and means light, insignificant.</i>
THEN DEFILEDST THOU IT. From the day that thou defiled my couch, my conjugal couch was removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The part of the verse under discussion reads: Then defiledst thou / my couch went up. I.E. reads “my couch went up” as if written, my couch went up from me. He interprets it to mean, my couch was taken away from me. According to I.E., in Chapter 7 of his <i>Yesod Mora</i>, Jacob ceased cohabiting with his wives after Reuben defiled his couch. His reason was: Rachel was dead, Bilhah defiled, and he was angry at Leah because of what her son did and therefore slept neither with her nor her handmaiden Zilpah. “My couch went up” thus means, my conjugal bed ceased to function. Filwarg suggests that the reference may be only to Bilhah.</i> <i>Yetzu’i alah</i> (he went up to my couch) is to be interpreted as if written <i>yetzu’i alah me’alai</i> (my conjugal couch went up from me). Furthermore, the word <i>alah</i> (went up) at times has the meaning of cut off,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In this case <i>yetzu’i alah</i> means my couch was cut off or destroyed.</i> as in <i>O my God, take me not away</i> (al ta’aleni) <i>in the midst of my days</i> (Ps. 102:25). Our chapter is clearly explained in Chronicles where we read, <i>Reuben (was) the first-born of Israel…but, forasmuch as he defiled his father’s couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, and he was not to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born</i> (I Chron. 5:1). Chronicles then tells us that Joseph received the birthright and Judah the kingship (<i>Ibid</i>. v. 2). Some explain that <i>and he was not to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born</i> means that the listing of the order of the twelve sons would start with Reuben.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>and he was not to be reckoned in the genealogy as first born</i> refers to Joseph, not to Reuben.</i>

Verse 5

SIMEON AND LEVI ARE BRETHREN. He referred to them as brethren because of what they did to the city of Shechem.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The point is all twelve sons were brethren, Why, then, does Jacob single out Simeon and Levi as brethren? Scripture tells us that at Shechem <i>two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi…took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males</i> (Gen. 34:25). Simeon and Levi were thus brothers in council with regard to the destruction of Shechem (Weiser).</i>
THEIR KINSHIP. Some say that the word <i>mekherotehem</i> (their kinship) is similar in meaning to <i>ha-karat</i> (the show of) in <i>The show of</i> (ha-karat) <i>their countenance doth witness against them</i> (Is. 3:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">That is, one can tell by looking at them that they employ weapons of violence (Weiser).</i> However, this interpretation is grammatically impossible.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekherotehem</i> and <i>ha-karat</i> come from different roots (Weiser).</i> Others say that <i>mekherotehem</i> is to be rendered their possessions<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Our text is thus to be rendered: weapons of violence are their possessions.</i> and is to be compared to the word <i>tikhru</i> (ye shall buy) in <i>and ye shall also buy</i> (tikhru) <i>water of them for money</i> (Deut. 2:6). However, this, too, is incorrect for the word <i>tikhru</i> means to dig.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 2:6 is thus to be rendered: ye shall dig water of them for money; that is, pay them so that they will give you permission to dig for water (Cherez).</i> Others say that <i>mekherotehem</i> is related to the word <i>mekhirah</i> (sale) and the meaning of <i>mekherotehem</i> is they sold themselves,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they sold themselves to weapons of destruction.</i> as in <i>a people that jeoparded</i> (cheref) <i>their lives unto the death</i> (Jud. 5:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Kimchi in Jud. 5:18. Although different verbs are employed in our verse and in Jud. 5:18, the idea is the same.

We thus see that Scripture occasionally omits the prepositional <i>bet</i>.</i> <i>the Lord</i> (II Kings 16:8) and with the word <i>ma’on</i> (habitation) in <i>which I have commanded in My habitation</i> (ma’on) (I Sam. 2:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture should have read <i>be-ma’on</i> rather than <i>ma’on</i>.

Gen. 34. <i>Weapons of violence their kinship</i> should thus be rendered: they employed weapons of violence in the land of their origin.</i>

Verse 6

LET MY SOUL NOT COME INTO THEIR COUNCIL. Rabbi Aaron<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Gaon of the school of Pumbedita. The great Hai Gaon was among his students.</i> explained the word <i>tavo</i> (come) in <i>Let my soul not come</i> (tavo) as having the meaning of set like the meaning of <i>ba</i> (goeth down, to set) in <i>and the sun goeth down</i> (ba) (Eccles. 1:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ba</i> means to come. In Eccles. 1:5 the word <i>ba</i> means sets, i.e., when the sun goes down (sets) it is no longer in the sky. Similarly the word <i>tavo</i>, which comes from the same root, here means will set. Let my soul not set from their council means let my soul always be in their council.</i> He interpreted <i>let my soul not come into their council</i> as meaning, I do not want to be outside of their council. However, Rabbi Aaron’s interpretation inverts the meaning of the verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Aaron interpreted <i>Let my soul not come in to their council</i> to mean let my soul not set from their council. The verse means I do not want my soul to be in their council. Thus Rabbi Aaron’s interpretation is precisely the opposite of what the verse actually says.</i> If Jacob praised Simeon and Levi, why did he mention weapons of violence? Furthermore, Jacob told his sons, <i>Ye have troubled me, to make me odious unto the inhabitants of the land</i> (Gen. 34:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Jacob was angry at what his sons did to the inhabitants of Shechem and on his deathbed would not praise them for this act.</i> The truth of the matter is that Simeon and Levi placed Jacob and his household in great jeopardy by their actions in Shechem. Indeed, were it not for the <i>terror of God</i> that <i>was upon the cities that were round about them</i> (Gen. 35:5), they would have surrounded Jacob and his family and exterminated them all. He (Rabbi Aaron) similarly explained<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in a positive manner, not that Jacob castigated his sons but praised them for slaying the inhabitants of Shechem and destroying its wall. Rabbi Aaron interprets verses 6-7 as follows: Let my soul not set from their council, from their assembly let my glory not be excluded; For in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they uprooted a cursed wall; For their anger was fierce, and their wrath it was cruel. Rabbi Aaron interprets verse 8 as follows: I will give them a good portion in Jacob (<i>achallekem be-ya’akov</i>) and may they multiply in Israel (<i>va-afitzem bi’yisra’el</i>) (Filwarg).</i> <i>Cursed be their anger</i> (v. 7) as meaning <i>and in their self will they uprooted a cursed wall</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Aaron renders <i>ikkeru shor</i> (they houghed oxen) as they uprooted a wall.</i> <i>for their anger was fierce</i>. The above explanations are unpalatable.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, cold, i.e., unpalatable as cold food (Krinsky).</i> Let my soul not come into their council.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I reject them. I.E. takes Jacob’s words and gives them a new twist.</i> Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Moses ben Samuel Gikatilla, an 11th century Bible commentator. See I.E. on Gen. 1:26 and the notes thereto.</i> says that <i>kevodi</i> (my glory) is synonymous with <i>nafshi</i> (my soul). He notes that we find the two often used synonymously in the book of Psalms. Rabbi Moses’ interpretation is correct since our text repeats itself in different words,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the second half of the line repeats what the first half said but in different words. In the first half it uses <i>nafshi</i>, in the second <i>kevodi</i>. However, both mean one and the same.</i> as is the style of prophetic statements. We thus find, <i>Ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, Thine elders, and they will tell thee</i> (Deut. 32:7), and (in Num. 23:8) <i>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I execrate, whom the Lord hath not execrated</i>? Thus <i>into their council</i> means the same as <i>unto their assembly</i>, come (<i>tavoh</i>) the same as be united (<i>techad</i>), and <i>nafshi</i> the same as <i>kevodi</i>. However, Rabbi Judah ben Balam the Spaniard<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Bible commentator and grammarian who lived in the 10th and 11th centuries. “His commentaries (in Arabic) on most of the Bible are remarkable for their philosophical method and use of comparison with Arabic.” (Cecil Roth, <i>Standard Jewish Encyclopedia</i>, p. 940).</i> says that Rabbi Moses erred. He maintains that <i>kavod</i> (glory) refers to the body because the body is the glory (<i>kavod</i>) of the soul in the same way that a necklace is the ornament to the neck,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The body is inferior to the soul, yet it is considered the soul’s glory in the same way that a necklace, although certainly less important than the neck, is nevertheless called the ornament of the neck (Cherez).</i> as we find in the verse <i>Who satisfieth thy body</i> (edyekh) <i>with good things</i> (Ps. 103:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew <i>edyekh</i> ordinarily means your ornament. J.P.S. translates it as thine old age. Rabbi Judah Balam interprets <i>edyekh</i> as referring to the body. However, I.E. in Psalms interprets <i>edyekh</i> as referring to the soul.</i> Rabbi Judah offers as a proof text,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>kavod</i> refers to the body.</i> <i>Yea, let him lay my glory</i> (kevodi) <i>in the dust. Selah</i>. (Ps. 7:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Which proves that glory cannot refer to the soul for it is impossible to lay the soul in the dust.</i> However, I say that Rabbi Judah errs, for we find Scripture saying, <i>So that my glory</i> (kevodi) <i>may sing praise to Thee</i> (Ps. 30:13),<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets this verse in his commentaries on Psalms as follows: So that all that have a soul (<i>kavod</i>) may sing praise to thee. We thus see that <i>kavod</i> refers to the soul. Rabbi Judah might retort that Ps. 30:13 should be interpreted: so that my body may sing praise to thee, or all that have a human form (<i>kavod</i>) may sing praise to thee.</i> and <i>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory</i> (kevodi) <i>rejoiceth; My flesh</i> (i.e., my body) <i>also dwelleth in safety</i> (Ps. 16:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kavod</i> must refer to the soul for otherwise body is mentioned twice in our verse. I.E. in Psalms interprets <i>my heart</i> as referring to man’s intelligence, <i>my glory</i> (kevodi) to man’s soul, and <i>my flesh</i> to the body.</i> As to the proof which Rabbi Judah offered from <i>Yea, let him lay my glory in the dust</i>, it is figurative. What the verse means is that my soul will be lowered as low as possible, i.e., to the dust. Positive proof that my interpretation is correct comes from <i>My soul</i> (nafshi) <i>cleaveth unto the dust</i> (Ps. 119:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This verse certainly must be taken figuratively. Similarly, Ps. 119:25.</i>
BE UNITED. <i>Techad</i> (be united) is related to the word <i>yachad</i> (united).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>yod, chet, dalet</i>.</i> However, according to Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen, the grammarian of blessed memory, the <i>tzere</i> beneath the <i>tav</i> of <i>techad</i> takes the place of the <i>alef</i> of <i>echad</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">That is, its root is <i>alef, chet, dalet</i>.</i> He similarly explains the word <i>tesham</i> (be desolate) in <i>and that the land be not desolate</i> (tesham) (Gen. 47:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that the root of <i>tesham</i> is <i>alef, shin, mem</i> and the <i>tav</i> is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i> to make up for the dropped <i>alef</i>. I.E. holds that it comes from the root <i>yod, shin, mem</i>. Cf. I.E.’s comments on Gen. 47:19.</i>
[INTO THEIR COUNCIL.] <i>Be-sodam</i> (into their council) is analogous to <i>be-hivvasedam</i> (while they took council) in <i>while they took council</i> (be-hivvasedam) <i>together against me</i> (Ps. 31:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Both words come from the root <i>samekh, vav, dalet</i> (Krinsky) and mean secret council.</i> The meaning of our verse is: since Simeon and Levi’s weapons are ones of violence (v. 5), <i>Let my soul not come into their council</i>.
THEY SLEW MEN. Scripture employs the term <i>ish</i> (man) generically as it does <i>shor</i> (ox) and <i>chamor</i> (ass) for oxen and asses (Gen. 32:6). <i>They slew men</i> alludes to the inhabitants of the city of Shechem.
OXEN. <i>Shor</i> (oxen) is to be rendered as wall. We similarly read, <i>Its branches run over the wall</i> (shur) (v. 22). I have already explained in my work <i>Moznayim</i> that the <i>cholam</i> and <i>shuruk</i> interchange.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore the fact that our verse reads <i>shor</i> and verse 22 <i>shur</i> presents no problem.</i>
[HOUGHED.] <i>Ikkeru</i> (houghed) is similar to the word <i>te’akker</i> (hough) in <i>thou shalt hough</i> (te’akker) <i>their horses</i> (Josh. 11:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>ikkeru shor</i> is to be translated, they uprooted a wall.</i> This verse shows that Shechem was a large city since it had a wall.

Verse 7

CURSED BE THEIR ANGER, FOR IT WAS FIERCE. Jacob either prophesied or offered a prayer that Simeon and Levi’s anger would (or should) diminish and that this would be for their very own good. For curse is the opposite of bless, and as a blessing means an increase, so a curse means a diminution.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>Cursed be their anger</i> means may their anger be diminished or their anger will be diminished.</i>
AND THEIR WRATH. A repetition in different words of <i>their anger</i>. The same is true with <i>I will divide them</i> and <i>And scatter them</i>. The meaning of <i>I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel</i> is, Simeon and Levi deserve to be separated and disunited. And so it was. For we find that the lot of the tribe of Simeon fell within the inheritance of the tribe of Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Josh. 19:1.</i> Simeon was thus under Judah’s dominion. Furthermore, its cities were discontiguous and scattered throughout the boundary of Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to having their inheritance within the tribe of Judah, their cities were also scattered within Judah’s boundaries (Weiser).</i> Similarly the forty-eight cities of the tribe of Levi were scattered among the other tribes.

Verse 8

JUDAH. Thou art as thy name,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">That is, thy name Judah means praise.</i> and thy brethren shall so praise thee.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads: Judah thou, thy brethren shall praise thee. I.E interprets thus: Judah thou art as thy name and thy brethren shall so praise thee.</i> When thy brothers shall see that <i>Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father’s sons shall bow down before thee</i> as to a king. This prophecy came to pass.

Verse 9

JUDAH IS A LION’S WHELP. Jacob compared Judah to a small lion’s whelp, to a type of whelp that grows into a lion.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>gur aryeh. Gur</i> (whelp) can be applied to any young animal. I.E. points out that <i>gur</i> (whelp) <i>aryeh</i> (lion) means a <i>gur</i> that grows up to be a lion, that is, a <i>gur</i> of the lion family (Cherez).</i> The comparative <i>caf</i> (meaning like) has been omitted,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads: Judah is a lion’s whelp. It should have read: Judah is as a lion’s whelp (<i>ke-gur</i>).</i> as it is in <i>When a wild ass’s colt</i> (ayir pere) <i>is born a man</i> (Job. 11:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">There, too, a <i>caf</i> should have been placed before <i>ayir pere</i> (a wild ass’s colt). We thus see that Scripture occasionally omits the comparative <i>caf</i>. However, it should be supplied by the reader.</i>
FROM THE PREY, MY SON, THOU ART GONE UP. My son, you appear to me as a lion’s whelp when thou art gone up from the prey. <i>From the prey</i> means after tearing a prey apart.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">According to Weiser.</i> This is its plain meaning. For us to interpret it as referring to the saving of Joseph,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">That it means: from the prey you brought up (saved) my son (Joseph). So Cherez.

The rest of the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Which reads, <i>He stooped down, he couched as a lion</i>, etc. (Cherez). According to Krinsky and Weiser: the next verse, which reads, <i>The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet</i>, is proof that our verse deals with Judah’s ability as a warrior and not with his saving Joseph. I.E. literally reads: “The following verse is proof.” Filwarg suggests that the word “following” is a scribal error.</i> is proof that the first part of the verse deals with Judah’s tearing of a prey and not with Judah’s saving of Joseph from being a prey. Observe the verse <i>And she brought up</i> (va-ta’al) <i>one of her whelps</i> (Ezek. 19:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">And you will see that when Scripture wants to say brought up, it employs the <i>hifil va-ta’al</i>.

Verse 10

THE SCEPTRE SHALL NOT DEPART FROM JUDAH. The sceptre of greatness shall not depart from Judah until David, who inaugurated the Kingdom of Judah, comes.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>The scepter shall not depart from Judah…as long as men come to Shiloh</i> The last part of the latter quote literally reads, until Shiloh cometh. I.E. interprets <i>shiloh</i> as referring to David, hence his interpretation: the scepter shall not depart from Judah…until David comes. Later in his commentary I.E. explains why Shiloh refers to David.</i> And so it was. Observe that in Israel’s march toward the promised land, the standard of the tribe of Judah set forth in the first (Num. 10:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the tribe of Judah was pre-eminent.</i> God also said, <i>Judah shall go up first</i> (Jud. 1:1, 2).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>After the death of Joshua,…the children of Israel asked of the Lord saying: Who shall go up for us to fight against the Canaanites, to fight against them? And the Lord said: Judah shall go up</i> (Jud. 1:1, 2). I.E. reads, “Judah shall go up first.” Either I.E. quoted from memory and erred or he amplified the Biblical verse. According to Krinsky the reference is to Jud. 20:18. There we read, with regard to the war against Benjamin, that Israel asked of the Lord, “Who shall go up to fight Benjamin first?” Scripture tells us, <i>And the Lord said: Judah first</i>. According to Krinsky, I.E. combined Jud. 1:2 and 2:18.</i>
[NOR THE RULER’S STAFF.] A scribe (<i>mechokek</i>) who will write (<i>she-yachok</i>) in a book.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>mechokek</i> (ruler’s staff) as scribe. The root <i>chet, kof, kof</i> means to inscribe. Cf. Is. 30:8, <i>And inscribe</i> (chukkah) <i>it in a book</i>. Thus <i>mechokek</i> is an inscriber, i.e., a scribe.</i>
[FROM BETWEEN HIS FEET.] Scribes sit at the feet of the ruler.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">According to Cohen.</i>
SHILOH. Some interpret <i>Shiloh</i> as Onkelos does. They say that it means “his.”<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>ad ki yavo shiloh</i> (literally, until shiloh cometh) as until the Messiah, to whom is the kingdom (shiloh meaning <i>shelo</i>, his) cometh.

The meaning of <i>ad ki yavo shiloh</i> thus is: until the child comes, the reference being until David from the house of Judah comes (Filwarg). Krinsky and Weiser apply it to the Messiah. Filwarg’s interpretation seems to be correct in view of the fact that I.E. explicitly states that this verse applies to David.</i> Others connect it to the Rabbinic term <i>shalil</i> (embryo).<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The interpretation being the same as in the note above.</i> There is also a commentator who says that <i>shiloh</i> refers to the city Shilo.

That is, Judah’s pre-eminence will continue throughout the period of Shiloh and when that is destroyed, it will be superseded by the royal line of David.</i> For it is written, <i>And he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh</i> (Ps. 78:60), and then, <i>He chose David also His servant</i> (Ps. 78:70). The latter interpretation is also not implausible. It is also possible that <i>Shiloh</i> means his son, with the <i>heh</i> taking the place of the <i>vav</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>shiloh</i> means his son, then the word should end in a <i>vav</i> rather than in a <i>heh</i>, as the <i>vav</i> with a <i>cholem</i> suffixed to a noun is the sign of the pronoun his. I.E. here accepts the interpretation that <i>shiloh</i> means his son. However, he connects it to the words <i>tashleh</i> rather than to <i>shelil</i> or <i>shilyah</i> as was done above (Filwarg).</i> as in the word <i>oholoh</i> (his tent) (Gen. 9:21), and that the word <i>shiloh</i> comes from the same root as <i>tashleh</i> (give birth) in <i>lo tashleh oti</i> (don’t cause me to give birth) (II Kings 4:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Don’t pray to God that I should give birth (Weiser, Cherez).</i>
[OBEDIENCE.] The word <i>yikkehat</i> (obedience of) is similar to the word <i>li-kehat</i> in <i>to obey</i> (li-kehat) <i>his mother</i> (Prov. 30:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">They both come from the root <i>kof, heh, tov</i> meaning obedience.</i> The <i>yod</i> of <i>yikkehat</i> is a third person imperfect prefix.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>yod</i> prefixed to a verb is the sign of the third person future.</i> The meaning of <i>ve-lo yikkehat ammim</i> is that nations shall obey him.

The <i>yod</i> of <i>oseri</i> (binding) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>oser</i>.</i> It is similar to the superflous <i>yods</i> of <i>ha-yoshevi</i> (that are enthroned) (Ps. 123:1)<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>ha-yoshev</i>.</i> and <i>le-susati</i> (to a steed) (Cant. 1:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>le-susah</i>.</i> both of which are superfluous.
HIS FOAL. <i>Iroh</i> (his foal) is similar to <i>ayarim</i> (ass colts) in <i>on thirty ass colts</i> (ayarim) (Jud. 10:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The singular is <i>ayir</i> and it means a young and vigorous male ass. The <i>heh</i> of <i>iroh</i> is in place of a <i>vav</i> as is indicated by the <i>keri</i> (Krinsky).</i> 
The <i>yod</i> of <i>beni</i> (colt) in <i>beni atono</i> (his ass’s colt) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beni atono</i> is a variation of <i>ben atono. Beni</i> thus does not mean my son.</i> The meaning of our verse then is: Binding his foal unto the vine and binding his ass’s colt unto the choice vine, for the word binding is to be read as if written twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The text has “binding” once. I.E. notes that it applies both to <i>his foal</i> and to <i>his ass’s colt</i>. This translation follows <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 which reads, “<i>ve-yehi perusho oseri la-gefen…ki…</i>, and its meaning is: Binding his foal…because <i>oseri</i> is to be read as if written twice.” The printed text reads, “<i>o yehiyeh pirusho ki</i>…or its meaning is because <i>oseri</i> is to be read as if written twice.” This reading is impossible. It implies that according to the first interpretation (that the <i>yod</i> of <i>oseri</i> is superfluous) <i>oseri</i> does not apply to the second part of the verse. However, according to the first interpretation <i>oseri</i> also refers to the second part of the verse as well, for how else can we interpret <i>And his ass’s colt unto the choice vine</i>, except by: And binding his ass’s colt unto the choice vine. Both Filwarg and Cherez note that I.E.’s comment as written in the printed text is incomprehensible. They suggest their own emendation. However, the reading in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 eliminates most of the difficulties. The reading in the printed texts probably arose because a scribe omitted <i>Binding his foal</i>, etc., and a latter scribe changed <i>ve-yehiyeh</i> to <i>o yehiyeh</i> in an attempt to make sense out of the remaining fragment. However, he failed to do so.</i>
UNTO THE CHOICE VINE. Scripture repeats the same idea in different words, for <i>sorekah</i> (vine) means the same as <i>gefen</i>, and <i>ayir</i> (foal) the same as <i>aton</i>. 
Similarly, <i>And his vesture in the blood of grapes</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Which means the same as <i>his garments in wine</i>.</i> Some say that <i>suto</i> (his vesture) is the word <i>kesuto</i> (his vesture) with the <i>kaf</i> missing.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>sutoh</i> comes from the root <i>caf, samekh, heh</i> which gives us the noun <i>kesut</i> (a covering, a vesture) (Cherez).</i> However, I believe that <i>sutoh</i> comes from the same root as <i>masveh</i> (veil) (Ex. 34:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">In this case the root of <i>sutoh</i> is <i>samekh, vav, heh</i>. Both opinions agree that <i>sutoh</i> means a vesture. They differ only in explaining the word’s origin.</i> The meaning of our verse is that his vineyards will produce so many grapes that Judah will bind<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>ye’esor</i> as in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i> his foal to the vine and he will not care if the animal eats of the grapes; and he will have so much wine that he will wash his garments in wine rather than in water. Scripture terms wine <i>the blood of grapes</i> because wine is red.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Prov. 23:31, <i>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red</i>.</i> The Bible speaks figuratively here, as it does in <i>And it shall come to pass in that day, That the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, And the hills shall flow with milk</i> (Joel 4:18). The land will produce so much wine that Judah will be called “red eyes” because of the great amount of wine that he will drink. <sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads: red eyes from wine. I.E. interprets accordingly.</i> He will be so called because the eyes of one who drinks much wine look red.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Prov. 23:29, 30, <i>Who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine</i>.</i> Similarly Judah’s teeth will be white from the large amount of milk that he will drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. The printed texts have “from eating milk.” But milk is drunk not eaten. The verse literally reads: and his teeth white from milk. I.E. interprets accordingly.</i>

Verse 12

AND HIS TEETH WHITE. <i>U-leven</i> (white) is an adjective modifying <i>shinnayim</i> (teeth).<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that <i>u-leven shinnayim</i> means white teeth not whiteness of teeth; hence he points out that <i>u-leven</i> is an adjective (Filwarg).</i> <i>Shinnayim</i> is in the dual form because the teeth are arranged in two sets.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">The dual form is usually limited to nouns that come in pairs, i.e., <i>oznayim</i> (ears), <i>yadayim</i> (hands). However, there is more than one tooth in the mouth. Hence the plural of <i>shen</i> (tooth) should not be in the dual form. I.E. thus explains that <i>shinayyim</i> is in the dual form because teeth come in two sets, an upper and a lower.</i> Saadiah Gaon, of blessed memory, explains <i>His eyes shall based with wine</i> to mean that his eyes shall be redder than wine. He similarly explains <i>And his teeth white with milk</i> to mean that his teeth shall be whiter than milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads <i>mi-yayin</i> (with wine), and <i>me-chalav</i> (with milk). The <i>mem</i> can have the meaning more than. Thus <i>mi-yayin</i> can mean more than wine, and <i>me-chalav</i>, more than milk.</i> Others say that <i>And his teeth white with milk</i> means that he will not eat an unclean thing and will not follow what his eyes see.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">According to Krinsky the reference is to an oath that Judah took to be especially scrupulous in what he would eat and what he would look upon (women). Judah considered certain permitted foods as “unclean” and abstained from them. Judah took his oath of superpiety after the incident of Tamar (Gen. 39) as a form of penance and to ensure that henceforth he would act more saintly.</i> The latter is a ridiculous homily.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">It implies that the other brothers were not as saintly as Judah in that they did not take the same oath that Judah did (Krinsky). Or this interpretation is extremely far fetched because there is no allusion to it in the text.</i> 
Jacob at first enumerated the tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob in prophesying about his children first prophesied about the sons of Leah, then about the sons of the handmaids, and finally concerning the sons of Rachel. In prophesying about the sons of Leah, Jacob followed the order of their birth. However, in prophesying concerning the sons of the handmaidens he did not follow the order of their birth. That is what I.E. means by <i>Jacob at first listed the tribes in order of their birth</i>.</i> in the order of their birth. However, he listed Zebulun before Issachar because Issachar’s inheritance fell between Zebulun and Dan.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Issachar is listed between Zebulun and Dan. Cf. Josh. 19.</i>

Verse 13

AT THE SHORE OF THE SEA. This, too, is proof that Jacob prophesied.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is obviously a prophecy that Zebulun would inherit a portion which borders on the sea shore in the land of Israel. This supports I.E.’s contention that Jacob’s final words to his children recorded in Chap. 49 are prophesies. Cf. I.E.’s comments on verse 1.</i> The meaning of <i>le-chof</i> (at the shore) is, at the border of. It comes from the same root as <i>chofef</i> (covereth) in <i>He covereth</i> (chofef) <i>him all the day</i> (Deut. 33:12). The border of the sea is called <i>chof</i> because it “covers” the boats as boats cannot be anchored in places that are open to the wind.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the border or shore (<i>chof</i>) protects or covers (<i>chofef</i>) the ships. Weiser suggests that what I.E. means by border is an inlet where the ships are anchored for protection.</i>
AND HIS FLANK SHALL BE UPON ZIDON. His flank shall extend to Zidon.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">His border shall extend to Zidon (Weiser)</i>

Verse 14

ISSACHAR IS A LARGE-BONED ASS. Jacob compared Issachar to an ass whose bones are heavy.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">That is, strong (Krinsky).</i> <i>Chamor</i> (ass) is in the construct with <i>garem</i> (bones).<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chamor garem</i> thus means an ass (<i>chamor</i>) of heavy bones (<i>garem</i>), rather than a heavy-boned ass. I.E.’s point is that <i>garem</i> is not an adjective modifying <i>chamor</i> (Filwarg, Weiser).</i> Due to the heaviness of his bones, he is wont to couch.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">According to Filwarg. The point is that this type of beast carries heavy loads and therefore often couches down to rest when burdened. It should be noted that I.E. is vague and that Weiser, Cherez and Krinsky offer other interpretations.</i>
BETWEEN THE SHEEPFOLDS. <i>Ben ha-mishpatayim</i> (between the sheepfolds) means between the arranged rows.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. does not tell us what he means by “arranged rows.” The reference may be to the burdens borne by the ass which are arranged in two rows, one on the right side of the animal and one on the left (Krinsky), or to the rows of the sheep-folds (Weiser).</i> It is possible that <i>mishpatayim</i> comes from the same root as <i>tishpot</i> (arrange) in <i>Lord, Thou wilt arrange</i> (tishpot) <i>peace for us</i> (Is. 26:12).

Verse 15

FOR HE SAW A RESTING-PLACE THAT IT WAS GOOD. When Issachar saw that his land and resting-place were pleasant, he, as an ass, bowed his shoulder to bear any and all burdens and became as a servant that pays levies. Scripture says this concerning Issachar because this tribe did not consist of warriors and its men did not want to leave their homes to go to war. Moses similarly said concerning Issachar, <i>Rejoice…Issachar, in thy tents</i> (Deut. 33:18). The levy mentioned in our verse may refer to Issachar’s payment of a money levy to the king in Israel in lieu of furnishing soldiers for his army, or it may refer to a payment of money to foreign nations that they should not attack them.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, “or to foreign nations who attacked them.” The point is that the tribe of Issachar were as servants (<i>mas oved</i>) because they paid a levy either to the king of Israel or to foreign nations.</i>

Verse 16

DAN SHALL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE. Jacob hinted that Dan, although born of a handmaid, would have a standard just as the tribes born of the wives did.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">For the standards see Num. 2. The four tribes with standards were: Reuben, Judah, Ephraim and Dan. The first three were descended from Jacob’s wives, Dan was the son of Bilhah, Rachael’s handmaid.</i> Dan was thus a ruler over all the other tribes that were descended from the handmaids.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">This explains <i>Dan shall judge his people</i>, i.e., he shall be a ruler over the tribes descended from the handmaids.</i> 

Verse 17

[A SERPENT.] Jacob compared Dan in his strength to a serpent.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture says that Dan shall be a serpent in the way. I.E. points out that Jacob compared Dan to a serpent only with regard to his ability to harm his enemies.</i> It is also possible that <i>shefifon</i> (a horned snake) comes from the same root as <i>yeshufekha</i> (they shall bruise thy) in <i>they shall bruise thy</i> (yeshufekha) <i>head</i> (Gen. 3:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>shefifon</i> means a snake. It is so called because it bruises (Krinsky).</i> According to this interpretation <i>shefifon ale orach</i> (a horned snake in the path) means the same as <i>nachash ale derech</i> (a serpent in the way).

Verse 18

[I WAIT FOR THY SALVATION, O LORD.] When the serpent bites the horse’s heel, it is afraid that the rider will smash its head with his sword. Hence the prophet prayed, <i>I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">When the serpent strikes (<i>that biteth the horse’s heels, so that his rider falleth backward</i>), he is not out of danger. The rider can still kill him. Hence Jacob prayed that God be with Dan so that when he struck his enemy he would escape safely.</i> The “thy” of <i>Thy salvation</i> refers to Dan.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>caf</i> of <i>li-shu’atekha</i> (for thy salvation) does not refer to God but to Dan. I.E. interprets thus because he believes our verse to be a prayer to God on behalf of Dan.</i> The meaning of our verse is: I trust to God for thy salvation. It is also possible that Scripture employs a noun (salvation) in place of an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets <i>li-shu’atekha</i> (for thy salvation) as if written <i>le-hoshi’akha</i>. The latter is a verb, the former a noun.</i> Our verse should thus be rendered: I trust that God will save thee. <i>Thy salvation</i> in <i>We will shout for joy in thy salvation</i> (Ps. 20:6) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Here, too, the “thy” in <i>thy salvation</i> does not refer to God.</i> The aforementioned is the case whether the “thy” of <i>thy salvation</i> (Ps. 20:6) refers to King David or to the anointed, his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">The Messiah (Cherez). Any of the Judean kings descended from David (Weiser). The point is that the <i>caf</i> suffixed to <i>yeshu’ah</i> (salvation or victory) does not refer to God. The same holds true in our verse (Filwarg, Cherez). <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, “Thy salvation (thy victory) is similar in that “thy” refers either to David or to the anointed his son.”</i> Rabbi Samuel Ha-Nagid says that the word <i>va-yomer</i> has been omitted from our clause and it should be read as if written: and he will say (<i>va-yomer</i>), I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">The subject of <i>va-yomer</i> is Dan, i.e., Dan after biting the horse’s heel will say, <i>I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord</i> (Filwarg). According to this interpretation “thy” in <i>Thy salvation</i> refers to God.</i> Rabbi Isaac<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">According to Weiser, the reference is to Rabbi Isaac, one of the early Gaonim of Sura.</i> explains our verse as follows: when the prophet Jacob prophetically saw his son Dan in the form of a serpent, he was overtaken by fright and exclaimed, “Save me, O Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">“Save me, O Lord” is a paraphrase of, <i>I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord</i>. According to this interpretation also, “thy” in <i>Thy salvation</i> refers to God. The reason for Jacob’s fright was explained by I.E. at the beginning of his comment.</i>

Verse 19

GAD. Jacob prophesied that a troop (an army) would attack Gad but that he would ultimately be victorious.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of <i>But he shall troop upon their heel</i>, heel meaning in the end. Cf. I.E.’s comments on Gen. 3:15.</i>
SHALL TROOP UPON HIM. <i>Yegudennu</i> (shall troop upon him) is similar to <i>yegudennu</i> (he invadeth) in <i>the people that he invadeth</i> (yegudennu) (Hab. 3:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>Gad gedud yegudennu</i> (Gad, a troop shall troop upon him) means, Gad, a troop shall invade or attack him.</i> <i>Yagud</i> (he shall troop), like <i>gedud</i> (a troop), comes from the root <i>gimel, dalet, dalet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">I. E.’s point is that <i>gedud</i> (a troop), <i>yegudennu</i> (shall troop upon him) and <i>yagud</i> (he shall troop) all come from the same double root, <i>gimel, dalet, dalet</i>. That <i>gedud</i> comes from this root is obvious. That <i>yagud</i> and <i>yegudennu</i> (<i>yagud</i> plus the suffix <i>nu</i>) come from this root is not as apparent. Double root letters are vocalized with a <i>cholam</i> and <i>ayin vav</i> roots with a <i>shuruk</i> in the <i>kal</i> imperfect. It thus appears that <i>yagud</i> and <i>yegudennu</i> come from the root <i>gimel, vav, dalet</i>, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is vocalized with a <i>shuruk</i> in place of a <i>cholam</i> like the word <i>yarun</i> (doth sing) in <i>But the righteous doth sing</i> (yarun) <i>and rejoice</i> (Prov. 29:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yarun</i> comes from the root <i>resh, nun, nun</i>, so it should have been vocalized <i>yaron</i>. We thus see that at times a double root is vocalized as an <i>ayin vav</i> (Cherez).</i> We do not know exactly to what incident Jacob was referring because we don’t know all the tribulations that our ancestors endured.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Cherez. We do not know when the tribe of Gad was attacked by an invading army.</i>

Verse 20

AS FOR ASHER. Some say that the <i>mem</i> of <i>me-asher</i> (as for Asher) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">None of the other tribes have a <i>mem</i> prefixed to their names (Weiser). Our verse should thus be translated: Asher, his bread shall be fat.</i> However, I believe that what our clause means is: from the land of Asher “fat bread” will come.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Or fat food, following <i>Vat.

Verse 22

JOSEPH IS A FRUITFUL VINE. <i>Ben</i> means a branch<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ben</i> means a son. Metaphorically speaking, the branch is the son of the tree. Hence <i>ben</i> can also mean a branch (Cherez).</i> and it is a feminine noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ben</i> is usually masculine. However, <i>porat</i> is feminine. Thus <i>ben</i> in <i>ben porat yosef</i> (Joseph is a fruitful branch) has to be feminine. If <i>ben</i> was masculine our phrase would read <i>ben poreh yosef</i>.</i> <i>Ben</i> in <i>And the branch</i> (ben) <i>that Thou madest strong for Thyself</i> (Ps. 80:16) has a similar meaning.

According to this interpretation <i>ben porat yosef</i> means Joseph is a plant containing branches (Krinsky).</i> The Bible repeats the phrase <i>ben porot</i> twice in succession, for that is Hebrew style. Compare, <i>For, lo, Thine enemies, O Lord, For, lo, Thine enemies shall perish</i> (Ps. 92:10). The repetition of a phrase indicates permanence. According to the second quoted interpretation<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>porat</i> is related to <i>porot</i> (in Ezek. 17:6)</i> a <i>tav</i> has been substituted for a <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">In the word <i>porat</i>. If <i>porat</i> means a branch then our verse should have read <i>ben porah</i>, since <i>porah</i> is the singular of <i>porot</i> (branches).

Rabbi Samuel Ha-Nagid explains this verse as meaning: they set his gall for a target (<i>va-yemareruhu</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mererah</i> means gall, hence Rabbi Samuel Ha-Nagid’s interpretation.</i> and then the archers shot at him (<i>va-robbu</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>yaru</i>, as in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i> The word <i>rabbim</i> (archers) in <i>Call together the archers</i> (rabbim) <i>against Babylon, All them that bend the bow</i> (Jer. 50:29) is similar to <i>va-robbu</i> in our verse. <sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the word <i>rabbim</i> means archers. <i>Va-robbu</i> is its verbal form. The root of the word is <i>resh, bet, bet</i>.</i> <i>His archers compass me round about…He poureth out my gall upon the ground</i> (Job 16:13) is similar to our verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">In that it speaks of the gall as a target for archers (Cherez).</i>
AND HATED HIM. First they hated him and then they set up his gall as a target. We must thus explain <i>va-yistemuhu</i> to mean, and they had hated him.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yistemuhu</i> (and hated him) follows <i>va-robbu</i> (and they shot at him). 
Logically, <i>va-yistemuhu</i> should come first, i.e., the sequence should be they hated him, they set his gall as a target, and they shot at thim. Hence <i>va-yistemuhu</i> should be taken as a pluperfect (Weiser).</i> This<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">The archers who hated and shot at Joseph.</i> alludes to Joseph’s brothers who sold him into slavery.

Verse 24

BUT HIS BOW ABODE FIRM. His bow abode in a firm place.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-etan</i> literally means in firm, which is short for <i>be-makom etan</i> (in a firm place) (Weiser).</i>
WERE MADE SUPPLE. <i>Va-yafozzu</i> means, and they strengthened themselves. I believe that <i>va-yafozzu</i> comes from the same root as <i>mefazzez</i> (leaping) (II Sam. 6:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">One who leaps gathers up strength (Filwarg). One who leaps strengthens (tightens) his girdle (Cherez quoting Kimchi).</i> There are those who connect <i>va-yafozzu</i> to the word <i>paz</i> (pure gold).<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">They explain <i>va-yafozzu zero’e yadav</i> (and the arms of his hand were made supple) to mean, and the arms of his hand were gilded, an allusion to the golden ring Pharaoh gave him. Cf. Rashi.</i> However, their interpretation makes no sense. 
The meaning of our text (v. 23 and 24) is that the archers hated Joseph and gathered together to spill his gall. However, his adversaries were afraid of him because his bow and hands were strong. They therefore could not overcome him.
BY THE HANDS OF THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB. FROM THENCE. <i>The Mighty One of Jacob</i> alludes to the Lord. From the power that Joseph received from <i>the Mighty One of Jacob</i> he was able to become, and indeed became, “the shepherd of the stone of Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The Stone of Israel</i> refers to the children of Israel (Cherez).</i> And so it was, for we read, <i>And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread</i> (Gen. 47:12). Jacob employed the term <i>Mighty One of Jacob</i> for God<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob could have employed the term, the Mighty One of Abraham or the Mighty One of Isaac (Krinsky).</i> because God knew of his deep love for Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph became “the shepherd of Israel” because of Jacob’s merit. God chose Joseph for this great honor and thereby elevated him above all his brothers because the Lord knew Jacob’s love for Joseph. Hence <i>By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob etc</i>. means: you became the shepherd of the stone (children) of Israel from the power that came to you from the God who knew of my deep love for you.</i> 
The meaning of <i>stone</i> is the very thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Stone</i> represents essence, the very thing. The reference is to Jacob and his family. Cf. Rashi.</i> Some say<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Rabbi Isaac ibn Giat (Weiser, Cherez).</i> that <i>mi-sham</i> (from thence) should be interpreted from that time. However, we never find the word <i>sham</i> (there) to have this meaning anywhere in Scripture. This commentator also interprets <i>the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel</i> as meaning: the one whose heart died and was as stone,<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Jacob whose heart died within him when he was told that Joseph was alive (Gen. 45:26,27). In I Sam. 25:37 such an experience is described as the heart turning to stone (Weiser, Cherez). According to Krinsky the reference is to Jacob and his family who would have died (their hearts would have turned to stone) had Joseph not fed them.</i> but who revived to feed (<i>ro’eh</i>), i.e., to live by eating. However, this interpretation is farfetched.

Verse 25

EVEN BY THE GOD OF THY FATHER. I believe that this verse is connected to the preceding one.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Even by God</i> literally reads, from the God (<i>me’el</i>). This term presents a problem. What came from God? I.E.’s answer is that from God refers to Joseph’s power which is referred to in the previous verse.</i> Its meaning is: the power which you possess came to you <i>from the God of thy father, who shall help thee</i>. The <i>mem</i> of <i>me-el</i> (even by God) is also to be prefixed to <i>ve-et</i> (and by).<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>ve-et</i> is to be read as if written <i>u-me-et</i> (and from by).</i> The <i>mem</i> of <i>me-el</i> is like the <i>bet</i> of <i>be-el</i> (as God) (Ex. 6:3) which is also to be prefixed to <i>u-ve-shemi</i> (but by my name).<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Our text is thus to be read as if written: From the God of thy father who shall help thee, and from the Almighty who shall bless thee. Ex. 6:3 literally reads: <i>and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty</i> (be-el shaddai) <i>but my name</i> (u-shemi) <i>YHVH I made Me not known to them</i>. According to I.E. we should read the aforementioned as if written: and I appeared…as God Almighty (<i>be-el shaddai</i>) but with My name (<i>u-ve-shemi</i>) YHVH I made Me not known to them.</i> Thus <i>And from the Almighty, who shall bless thee</i> repeats the idea contained in <i>From the God of thy father, who shall help thee</i>. Saadiah Gaon explains the phrase <i>me-el avikha</i> to mean, I will ask of the God of thy fathers.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah, too, was bothered by the term <i>from the God</i>. He explained <i>from the God</i> not as connected to the previous verse, but as a new thought; viz., I will ask of the God of thy fathers that he help thee and of the Almighty that he bless thee (Cherez).</i> It is possible that <i>With blessings of heaven above</i> is connected to, <i>From the God of thy father</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation, like the previous one, deals with the problem of verse 25 opening with the words <i>From the God</i>. It similarly rejects the notion that verse 25 is connected to verse 24. It, too, sees in verse 25 a new thought. It explains <i>From the God</i> as relating to the blessings mentioned in the second half of the verse, which shall come to you <i>from the God of thy father</i>.</i> The meaning of our text is explained by <i>They (the blessings) shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the prince among his brethren</i> (v. 26).<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26 seems to conclude the blessing started in verse 25. The sequence thus appears to be: From God shall come to you blessings of the heavens above, of the deep that coucheth beneath, blessings of the breasts and womb. The aforementioned blessings shall be added to my mighty blessings and to the blessings of my progenitors and shall be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of the prince among his brethren (Krinsky).</i>
BLESSSINGS OF THE DEEP. Moses similarly said, <i>And for the precious things of the earth and the fullness thereof</i> (Deut. 33:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">So Cherez. The point is that the blessing of the deep means that the land will be well watered and fertile, as Moses blessed the tribe of Joseph with a fertile land. Krinsky suggests that our text is corrupt and that the proof text should read: <i>For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath</i> (Deut. 33:13). In this case I.E. is pointing out that Jacob and Moses’ blessings are identical.</i> The word <i>tehom</i> (the deep) is feminine both in our verse and in Deut. (33:16). It is similarly feminine in <i>The deep</i> (tehom) <i>made it to grow</i> (Ezek. 31:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>tehom rovetzet</i> (the deep that coucheth). Deut. 33:13 reads, <i>u-mi-tehom rovetzet</i> (and for the deep that coucheth). <i>Rovetzet</i> (coucheth) is feminine, hence <i>tehom</i> (the deep) must be feminine. Ezek. 31:4 reads, <i>tehom romematehu</i> (the deep made it to grow). Since <i>romematehu</i> is feminine, <i>tehom</i>, too, must be feminine. I.E. makes this point because <i>tehom</i> is masculine in Ps. 42:8. Thus we see that <i>tehom</i> is both masculine and feminine.</i> The meaning of <i>With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath</i> is that rain will descend from the heavens above upon the land of Joseph and that the deep which coucheth beneath the earth will fill its rivers and springs with an abundance of water.
BLESSINGS OF THE BREASTS, AND OF THE WOMB. Jacob likened the breasts to heaven and the womb to the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>With blessings of heaven…Blessings of the deep…Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb</i>. According to I.E. breast and womb are similar to heaven and earth in that they produce life-giving substance and bring forth fruit. Hence they are included in the same verse.</i> its meaning being that Joseph will be blessed with many children.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">For an alternate interpretation see Krinsky and Cherez.</i> The opposite of this blessing is the curse, <i>Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts</i> (Hos. 9:14).

Verse 26

THE BLESSINGS OF THY FATHER. These blessings which I have blessed you with are mighty and are added to the blessing with which my progenitors blessed me.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">The point being, may you be blessed with the mighty blessings with which I bless you (<i>birkat avikhah gaveru</i>) plus the blessings with which my begetters blessed me (<i>al birkat horai</i>). Cherez explains that I.E. interprets <i>al</i> (beyond) as meaning <i>im</i> (with, plus).</i>
[PROGENITORS.] <i>Horai</i> is to be rendered my begetters.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>horai</i> is <i>heh, resh, heh</i> which means to be pregnant or to conceive. However, inasmuch as <i>horai</i> is in the plural it must refer to both Jacob’s mother and father. We obviously cannot explain <i>horai</i> as meaning the ones who bore me. Rather it must be interpreted to mean the ones who begot me (Cherez).</i> <i>Va-tahar</i> (and she gave birth to) in <i>and she gave birth to</i> (va-tahar) <i>Miriam</i> (I Chron. 4:17)<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Here, too, the root <i>heh, resh, heh</i> does not means to conceive or be pregnant with, for Chronicles deals with births and not with pregnancies. Thus <i>va-tahar</i> in I Chron. 4:17 means she gave birth to.</i> and <i>horah</i> (brought forth) in, <i>A man-child is brought forth</i> (horah) (Job 3:3)<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Here, too, the root <i>heh, resh, heh</i> does not mean to conceive but to bring forth, for its parallel reads <i>ivvaled</i> (I was born).</i> are similar.
UNTO THE UTMOST BOUND. <i>Ta’avat</i> (utmost bound of) comes from the same root as <i>ve-hitavvitem</i> (and ye shall mark out your line) (Num. 34:10). The meaning of our verse is: these blessings will be as high as the line marked out by the everlasting hills.
THE PRINCE AMONG HIS BRETHREN. <i>Nezir</i> (prince of) comes from the same root as <i>nezer</i> (crown).<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">It means crowned, the one who was crowned over his brethren (Krinsky, Weiser and Cherez). Filwarg suggests reading, “From the same root as <i>nazir</i> (Nazirite).” This reading fits in very well with I.E.’s comparison of <i>nezir</i> to <i>nediv</i>, for <i>nazir</i> has the same vocalization as <i>nadiv</i>, both in the absolute and in the construct. Thus in the absolute we have <i>nazir</i> and <i>nadiv</i> and in the construct <i>nezir</i> and <i>nediv</i>.</i> It is in the construct with <i>echav</i> (his brethren) and is therefore vocalized <i>nezir</i>. Compare, <i>nediv lev</i> (willing-hearted) (Ex. 35:22).

Verse 27

BENJAMIN. Jacob compared Benjamin to a wolf because Benjamin was mighty. The men of Gibeah are proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">At Gibeah 26,700 Benjamites defeated an army of 400,000 Israelites. Cf. Jud. 20.</i>
THE PREY. <i>Ad</i> (the prey) has the same meaning as the Aramaic word for spoil (<i>ada</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>kemo targum shelal</i> as in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 rather than <i>targum shalal</i> as in the printed manuscripts. Also cf. Kimchi’s commentary on Is. 33:23.</i> Similarly, <i>ad</i> in <i>Then is the prey</i> (ad) <i>of a great spoil divided</i> (Is. 33:23) and in <i>Until the day that I rise up to the prey</i> (ad) (Zeph. 3:8); and <i>iddim</i> (a polluted garment) (Is. 64:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. on Is. 64:5 notes that a garment taken in spoil is polluted by blood. He points out that <i>iddim</i> and <i>ed</i> are similar. I.E. interprets <i>ed</i> (prey) to mean spoil.</i>.
[AND AT EVEN HE DIVIDETH.] At even he divideth among his children the prey that he has taken as spoil. Joshua says<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">A Karaite scholar.</i> that our verse alludes to King Saul who defeated the Amalekites.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Saul is likened to a wolf who takes spoil. Saul defeated the Amalekites and despoiled them. Cf. I Sam. 15.</i> He explains <i>In the morning</i> as alluding to the beginning of Israel’s kingdom<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">At the beginning of Israel’s kingdom Saul, who came from the tribe of Benjamin, despoiled Amalek. In exile, Mordecai the Benjamite despoiled Haman who was an Amalekite. Cf. Es. 8:1,2, <i>On that day did king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman…unto Esther the queen…And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman</i>.</i> and <i>at even</i> as referring to the period of Israel’s exile with regard to Mordecai. However, this interpretation is the way of the Midrash.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 99:3 and <i>Tanchuma</i> 1:14; 2:15.

Verse 28

EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS BLESSING. The blessing which Jacob gave each one of his sons came to pass upon each one. The meaning of <i>every one according to his blessing</i> is similar in meaning to <i>each man according to the interpretation of his dream</i> (Gen. 41:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph’s interpretation of the dreams came true for the butler and the baker, <i>each man according to the interpretation of his dream</i>. (Gen. 41:11).</i>

Verse 29

AND HE CHARGED THEM. He (Jacob) charged that all should go along with Joseph to bury him.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And he charged them</i> refers to <i>bury me with my fathers</i>. In the text they are not directly connected, hence I.E.’s comment. Krinsky points out that Jacob had made Joseph take an oath to bury him in the cave of Machpelah (Gen. 47:30). He now commanded all of his sons to join Joseph in his burial. Therefore, according to Krinsky, I.E. notes that the charge in our verse was to all of Jacob’s sons.</i>

Verse 33

HE GATHERED UP HIS FEET INTO THE BED. Until then he had been sitting on the bed with his feet dangling over its edge as is contemporarily the custom in Christian communities. The beds in Moslem countries are constructed differently from the beds in Christian countries.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains that Egyptian beds were the same as the beds used in Christian countries; hence it was possible for Jacob’s feet to dangle from his bed. However, had his bed been like those used in Moslem countries, that is, a bed that lies flat on the ground, this would have been impossible. I.E. makes this point so that readers in Moslem countries could understand how Jacob could be in bed with his feet over its side.</i>

Verse 2

AND THE PHYSICIANS EMBALMED ISRAEL. They powdered his body with a preservative.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This according to I.E. is the way a body is embalmed (Weiser). Krinsky holds that I.E. believes that only Jacob was embalmed in this manner so that his body would be spared the desecration that the usual embalming procedure entails.</i> It is possible, though a bit far fetched, that <i>chanetah</i> (putteth forth) in <i>The fig-tree putteth forth</i> (chanetah) <i>her green figs</i> (Cant. 2:13) is analogous to <i>va-yechantu</i> (embalmed).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Verse 5

WHICH I HAVE DIGGED. <i>Kariti</i> means I have digged. <i>Kariti</i> is similar to <i>yikhreh</i> in <i>if a man shall dig</i> (yikhreh) <i>a pit</i> (Ex. 21:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to Krinsky, I.E. believes that Jacob prepared his own grave in the cave of Machpelah.</i>

Verse 7

AND WITH HIM WENT UP ALL THE SERVANTS OF PHARAOH. All of Egypt with the exception of Joseph are called servants of Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The verse speaks of <i>the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house</i>. If the aforementioned are elders, why does the Bible refer to them as servants? Hence I.E.’s comment. According to Cherez and Krinsky, I.E. was troubled by the clause <i>all the servants of Pharaoh</i>. If all the servants went along with Joseph to bury Jacob then no servants remained in Egypt to serve Pharaoh. This appears highly unlikely. Hence I.E. points out that <i>all the servants</i> refers to the Egyptians who accompanied Jacob’s body, for all the Egyptians are called Pharaoh’s servants.</i>

Verse 10

AND HE MADE A MOURNING FOR HIS FATHER SEVEN DAYS. This, as our sages of blessed memory say, took place after they interred Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">What I.E. means is, even though the actual burial of Jacob is reported in verse 13, it occurred before <i>he made a mourning for his father seven days</i>. This is so because the sages of the talmud say that mourning commences after the burial of the deceased. Cf. <i>Sanhedrin</i>. 47b.</i>

Verse 12

AND HIS SONS DID UNTO HIM. That is: And behold his sons did as he commanded them, namely, carried him and buried him in the place that he commanded them to inter him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since the mourning described in verse 10 took place after the burial of Jacob we cannot interpret <i>And his sons did unto him</i>, etc., as a report of what happened after the mourning for Jacob.

Verse 15

IT MAY BE THAT JOSEPH WILL HATE US.

AND HE WAS PUT IN A COFFIN. Someone put him in a coffin.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>va-yisem</i> is a <i>kal</i> which means, and he put However, the subject has been omitted. Hence we must interpret it as, and someone put. Similarly the word <i>oto</i> (him) is to be added to the text Hence <i>va-yisem ba-aron</i> should be rendered, and someone put him in a coffin.</i> The root of <i>va-yisem</i> is <i>yod, sin, mem</i> and follows the paradigm of <i>va-yitzer</i> (formed) (Gen. 2:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yitzer</i> is a <i>peh yod, kal</i>.

Hence Rabbi Jonah says that <i>va-yisem</i> has been vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> in place of a <i>shuruk</i>. According to Rabbi Jonah <i>va-yisem ba-aron</i> is to be rendered: and he was put in a coffin. The advantage of this interpretation is that one does not have to add the pronoun <i>oto</i> (him) to the text and the subject is not omitted from the verse.</i> However, I consider this interpretation to be far-fetched.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If Scripture intended to use a <i>hofal</i>, it would have vocalized <i>va-yisem</i> like a <i>hofal</i>.

[IN A COFFIN.] The reason why <i>ba-aron</i> (in a coffin) is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> is that it signifies the coffin which he had prepared for himself. <sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-aron</i> means in a coffin. <i>Ba-aron</i> on the other hand means in the coffin.
