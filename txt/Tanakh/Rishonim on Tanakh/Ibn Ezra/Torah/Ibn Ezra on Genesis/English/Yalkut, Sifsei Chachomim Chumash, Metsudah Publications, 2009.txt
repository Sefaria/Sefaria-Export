Verse 17

<b>Ad-noy Elokim commanded.</b> Hashem would not have commanded Adam to begin with if he possessed no intelligence. Moreover, he obviously possessed the intellect to give names to the other creatures. It was only knowledge of good and evil that he lacked.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>And it said to the woman.</b> Some say that Chavah understood the gesticulations of the animals. According to Rav Sadyah Gaon, however, whenever speech is ascribed to an animal it is actually an angel that is speaking on its behalf. Alternatively, it is possible that these verses are to be taken literally, since it is no more difficult for Hashem to give intelligence to a serpent than to human beings.

<b>Righteous.</b> In his deeds.
<b>Flawless.</b> In his heart.
<b>In his generation (literally, “generations”).</b> In the generation of the Flood and all the succeeding generations through which he lived. Noach did not die until Avraham was fifty-eight years old.

Verse 10



Verse 11

Verse 3

<b>Elokim came.</b> An angel appeared to him on Avraham’s behalf. Pharaoh was afflicted with severe plagues (12:17) whereas regarding Avimelech it is written only that Hashem “restrained every womb.” This is because Avimelech was less wicked than Pharaoh.

Verse 4

<b>Will You also kill an innocent nation.</b> He prayed on behalf of his entire nation.

<b>Bread and a skin of water.</b> Since Hashem told him to listen to all that Sarah said he could not give Hagar anything without Sarah’s permission. Nevertheless, after Sarah’s death he gave the sons of his concubines gifts (25:6). 
It is also possible that he gave Hagar gifts that Scripture does not mention. <b>She went and lost her way.</b> Avraham gave her sufficient supplies to reach Beer Sheva had she not become lost.

Alternatively, he entered the tent of <i>one</i> of the two handmaids. <b>He left Leah’s tent.</b> After he left the tents of the handmaids he returned to Leah’s tent. Alternatively, Scripture delayed mentioning that he entered Rochel’s tent immediately upon leaving Leah’s in order to conclude with Rochel’s subterfuge.
