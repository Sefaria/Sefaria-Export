Ibn Ezra on Leviticus



Chapter 1



Verse 1

In the name of God who commandsthat a fire offering be brought before him.I begin to explain the book <i>And The Lord Called Unto Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. This poem is omitted in the printed editions of I.E.</i><br>AND THE LORD CALLED. We find two reasons for the covenant made with an individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>berit yachid</i>. The reference is to the covenant of circumcision that God made with Abraham (Gen. 17:9). The commentaries on I.E. differ as to what these two reasons are. Scripture tells us that circumcision is a sign that the Lord will be God to Abraham and his seed after him (Gen. 17:7). I.E. believes that circumcision is also a sign not to act promiscuously. I.E. writes, “The excision of the foreskin of the flesh is a sign of the covenant between man and his creator not to defile one’s soul by engaging in an act of sexual intercourse that is not in accordance with the way of truth” (<i>Yesod Morah</i>, (Strickman translation, p. 102).</i> It is also possible for one commandment to have many reasons. The commandment regarding the burnt offering and the sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The other sacrifices.</i> are examples of the latter, for when the officiant offers each part<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Of the sacrifice.</i> in its proper time, then the part<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The person. The individual Jew is a part of the people of Israel and of the human species. Hence I.E. refers to the individual as a part.</i> which has a part<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A portion.</i> in the world to come is saved.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the sacrificial animal serves as a substitute for the celebrant. “All these acts are performed in order that when they are done, a person should realize that he has sinned against his God…and that his blood should really be spilled and his body burned, were it not for the loving-kindness of the Creator, Who took from him a substitute and a ransom, namely, this offering, so that its blood should be in place of his blood, its life in place of his life, and that the chief limbs of the offering should be in place of the chief parts of his body” (Nachmanides, Chavel translation, Lev. 1:9, p. 21).</i> Therefore the meaning of <i>le-khapper</i> (to make atonement) (v. 4) is to give ransom. The opening of the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 30:11-16.</i> is proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>le-khapper</i> means to offer a ransom, for we read there that each male Israelite was to give a half shekel as a ransom for his soul (<i>kofer nefesh</i>) (Ex. 30:12). Scripture goes on to say, <i>that there be no plague among them</i>.</i> Scripture therefore reads, <i>lest He</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God.</i> <i>fall upon us with pestilence</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If we do not sacrifice to God.</i> (Ex. 5:3). There is also a secret<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the one just given.</i> regarding the future in the burnt offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When accepted by God, it ensures one’s future (Weiser).</i> One can also learn from each sacrifice the secret of nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The sacrifices inspire the celebrant. His mind is opened to study the secrets of nature.</i> The purpose of the sin offering<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Whose flesh was eaten by the <i>kohanim</i>.</i> and the unleavened bread<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">From a thanksgiving offering (Lev. 7:14) or a meal offering (Lev. 2:3; 7:9). Our text reads <i>ve-ha-matzot. Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 and some editions read <i>veha-manot</i> (and the portions), i.e., the portions of the sacrifices which are to be eaten by the <i>kohanim</i>.</i> is to sustain the teachers of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohanim</i>, who teach Torah to the Jewish people. See Lev. 33:10; Mal. 2:7.</i> The reason <i>And the Lord called unto Moses</i> follows <i>And Moses was not able to enter</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The sanctuary.</i> (Ex. 40:35) is that the Glory<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">God’s glory.</i> called to Moses from the tent of meeting and told him to come there, and there He would speak with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The end of the Book of Exodus tells that when the construction of the tabernacle was concluded, Moses could not enter the tabernacle because God’s glory filled it. (Ex. 40:35). Leviticus picks up where Exodus leaves off and tells us at its opening, <i>And the Lord called unto Moses</i>; that is, God invited Moses to the tabernacle.</i> The Glory was on the other side of the curtain<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>parochet</i> which separated the Holy of Holies from the holy. The Glory was in the Holy of Holies.</i> and Moses entered there.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Into the Holy of Holies.</i> The latter is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 25:22.</i> This is the meaning of <i>and the similitude of the Lord doth he behold</i> (Num. 12:8). The reason Scripture mentions the sacrifices before the commandments<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Book of Leviticus opens with the laws dealing with sacrifices and then goes on to legislate laws of purity, prohibited sexual relations, interpersonal relations, etc. I.E. raises the question why the laws dealing with the sacrifices are given priority.</i> is that God’s presence will return to its place<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In heaven. See Hos. 5:15, <i>I</i> (God) <i>will go and return to My place</i>.</i> if Israel does not keep the law of the burnt offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>olah</i>.</i> The latter came to pass.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The destruction of the temples, which resulted in the cessation of the burnt offering, signified the removal of the manifestation of God’s presence over Israel (Weiser).</i> Far be it from God to require a burnt offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For His own purposes.</i> Scripture clearly states, <i>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee…</i>(Ps. 50:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>For the world is mine…Do I eat the flesh of hulls or drink the blood of goats?</i> These two verses completely dispel the idea that the sacrifices were food for God.</i> On the contrary, it<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The burnt offering.</i> has a secret meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the burnt offering causes “a power from on high to rest on man,” Gen. 8:21 (Vol. 1, p. 119).</i>

Verse 2

OF YOU. The word <i>mikkem</i> (of you) is placed at the end of the clause.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Our clause reads, <i>adam ki yakriv mikkem</i>. The latter literally reads, when any man bringeth an offering of you. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The clause should be read as if written, <i>adam mikkem ki yakriv</i> (when any man of you bringeth an offering). There are many such examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Where a word placed at the end of clause should be read as if placed earlier.</i> On the other hand, the word <i>mikkem</i> might mean from your property.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>mikkem</i> (of you) means of your property. In this case the word <i>mikkem</i> does not have to be moved, for the meaning of <i>the clause</i> is, when any man bringeth an offering of your (that is, his) property.</i> The term <i>mikkem</i> might also hint that one is not permitted to bring an offering that is stolen,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In this case our verse is to be read as follows: When any man bringeth an offering of you, that is, it shall be of yours. It shall belong to you.</i> for Scripture states, <i>I hate robbery with iniquity</i> (Is. 61:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>be-olah. Be-elah</i> may be rendered iniquity or burnt offering. I.E. translates it as burnt offering.</i>
OF THE CATTLE. Shall the sacrifice be. This<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Cattle. Hebrew, <i>behemah</i>.</i> is a general term. Scripture then gives the particulars and states, <i>even of the herd</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>bakar</i>.</i> <i>or of the flock</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tzon</i>.</i> The flock refers to the species of the sheep and the goat. <i>Your offering</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Which concludes our verse.</i> is also a general term.

Verse 3

IF HIS OFFERING BE A BURNT–OFFERING. This<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>burnt offering</i>.</i> is a particular. The term <i>olah</i> (burnt offering) is self-explanatory.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>ayin, lamed</i>, <i>heh</i>, which means to go up. The term <i>olah</i> is thus connected in meaning to the word <i>oleh</i> (going up).</i>
OF THE HERD. Fully grown or young but more than eight days.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">An animal younger than eight days is unfit to be brought as a sacrifice. See Lev. 22:27.</i> The burnt offering is brought from the choicest animals because it is entirely for God. The male is chosen above the female. Therefore a female animal is not brought for a burnt offering.
WITHOUT BLEMISH. <i>Tammim</i> means without blemish.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>tammim</i> literally means whole. This might be taken to mean not missing an organ. Hence I.E. comments that whole means without blemish.</i> After stating <i>he shall offer it</i>, Scripture goes on to explain the place where the celebrant is to bring it. It states that he is to enter into the courtyard of the tent of meeting.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The door of the tent of meeting</i> was located in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.</i>
BEFORE THE LORD. This is to be understood as connected to <i>he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is to be understood as follows: he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting before the Lord.</i> THAT HE MAY BE ACCEPTED<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>li-retozno</i>. I.E. renders this as, of his own free will. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> 
BEFORE THE LORD. He shall offer it willingly, not by coercion.

Verse 4

AND HE SHALL LAY HIS HAND. It would appear from the plain meaning of the text that the celebrant lays one hand<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture reads <i>yado</i> (his hand).</i> on the animal about to be sacrificed, for the manner of the scapegoat<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the goat which is sent, the scapegoat which is sent into the wilderness on Yom Kippur. Scripture explicitly tells us that two hands are to be laid on the scapegoat. See Lev. 16:21.</i> is unlike all sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The scapegoat is not treated as all other sacrifices. Its blood is not sprinkled on the altar, and none of its flesh is offered on the altar. It is sent away into the wilderness. Hence we cannot generalize from it.</i> Scripture therefore changed [the manner of the laying of the hands with regard to it].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike other sacrifices, it requires the laying of two hands.</i> However, we find that the sages who transmitted the laws to us stated that all “laying” is done with two hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever Scripture speaks of laying the hand it refers to the laying of two hands.</i> We rely on them. The body<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The body of the animal which serves as a sacrifice.</i> which is offered to atone for that which comes (<i>ha-olah</i>) into the mind<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According to the sage, Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai, the burnt offering is brought to atone for improper thoughts. See <i>Va-Yikrah Rabba</i> 7:3.</i> is called an <i>olah</i> (burnt offering). The sacrifices brought for sins and guilt are also called <i>chattat</i> (sin offering) and <i>asham</i> (guilt offering).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Their names also explain the reason for these sacrifices.</i> 
AND IT SHALL BE ACCEPTED<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-nirtzeh</i> (literally, he will be favored). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> FOR HIM. He will obtain favor from God.
TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIM.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>le-khapper alav</i>.</i> To serve as a ransom for the punishment due him.

Verse 5

BEFORE THE LORD. Like the burnt offering of the flock, on the side of the altar northward, opposite the table.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The table of showbread. The latter was placed in the northern part of the tabernacle.</i> 
The meaning of <i>and he shall kill</i> is that the <i>kohen</i> shall kill. One slaughters<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-shachat</i> (and he shall kill) is in the singular.</i> and many dash the blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-zareku</i> (and dash) is in the plural and thus refers to Aaron’s sons.</i> Scripture clearly states this i.e., <i>and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood</i> (Lev. 9:12). 
Scripture states, <i>that is at the door of the tent of meeting</i> because it wants to exclude the altar of incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Which was inside the tent of meeting.</i>

Verse 6

AND HE SHALL FLAY. A <i>kohen</i> or a Levite accompanies him.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In order to assist him.</i>

Verse 7

AND THE SONS OF AARON THE PRIEST. Levites shall not approach.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">To perform the service described in our verse.</i> This commandment was given to the <i>kohanim</i>. Not less than two<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kohanim</i>.</i> are required.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">For the verse speaks of sons of Aaron.</i>

Verse 8

AND THE SUET. Many wise men of the generation explain that the word <i>pader</i> (suet) refers to the carcass. However, in my opinion the <i>pader</i> refers to the fat. Our verse is to be understood as follows: <i>And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces</i>, that is, the pieces of the carcass;<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible to read our verse as follows: And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the suet. In other words, <i>the pieces</i> refers to the head and the suet. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> <i>and the head, and the suet</i>, that is, the fat. A connective <i>vav</i> is missing from the word <i>ha-rosh</i> (and the head).<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha-rosh</i> (literally, the head) is to be read as if written <i>ve-ha-rosh</i> (and the head). In other words, our verse is to be read as follows: And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the suet.</i> This is in keeping with the style of the language.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture occasionally omits the connective <i>vav</i>. However, the text is to be understood as if it were present.</i> Compare, <i>odem pitidah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pitidah</i> is to be read as if written <i>u-pitidah</i> (and carnelian). See I.E. on Ex. 1:4 (Vol. 2, p. 6).</i> <i>u-vareket</i> (carnelian, topaz, and smargd) (Ex. 28:17). <i>And he shall cut it into its pieces</i> (v. 12)<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And cut it</i> (the burnt offering) into its pieces. I.E. points out that a parallel verse literally reads, <i>And he shall cut it into its pieces and its head</i> (ve-et rosho) <i>and its suet</i> (v. 12). We thus see that <i>its pieces</i> refers <i>to the</i> carcass <i>of</i> the animal, not to its head and suet.</i> and along with the pieces, its head and its suet. On the other hand, <i>et ha-rosh</i> (and the head) might mean with the head.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In this case a connective <i>vav</i> need not be placed before <i>ha-rosh</i>, for the meaning of our verse is: And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, with the head and the suet.</i> There are many such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Where <i>et</i> has the meaning of with. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 27).</i> The proof of this<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>the pieces</i> do not include the head and the suet.</i> is: <i>Moses made the head, and the pieces, and the suet smoke</i> (Lev. 8:20).
SHALL LAY THE PIECES. Scripture reads <i>ve-arekhu</i> (shall lay)<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-arekhu</i> (shall lay) is a plural. It literally means, and they shall lay.</i> because it speaks of a bullock, a large animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">And it requires more than one person to handle it.</i> Regarding a sheep,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a small animal.</i> Scripture states, <i>and the priest shall lay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-arakh</i>, which is in the singular.</i> <i>them</i> (v. 12).

Verse 9

SHALL HE WASH WITH WATER. A <i>kohen</i> or a Levite. Scripture therefore has to add the word <i>kohen</i> to <i>shall make the whole smoke</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">For only the <i>kohen</i> may perform this work.</i>
A BURNT-OFFERING. The word <i>isheh</i> (burnt offering) is an adjective. It means a fire offering. It describes the word <i>hakol</i> (the whole).<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">All of it shall be offered as a burnt offering.</i>
A SWEET SAVOUR. The word <i>nicho’ach</i> (a sweet savour) is self-explanatory.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">It is obviously related to the word <i>menuchah</i> (rest). See I.E. on Gen. 5:8 (Vol. 1, p. 118). He explains <i>nicho’ach</i> as meaning that the sacrifice assuages God’s anger, or that it causes a power from on high to rest on man.</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11

ON THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR. On the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yerakh</i> which literally means side of, at times can mean beyond the side.</i> Similarly [<i>Even mount Zion</i> ], <i>the uttermost part</i> (yarkete) <i>of the north</i><sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The northern part of Jerusalem. The verse literally reads, <i>Even mount Zion, the side of the north</i>.</i> (Ps. 48:3). For many err and say that the tower of Zion<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Which was located on Mount Zion. See Ps. 48:13.</i> was in the midst of Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The side</i> means on the outside, next to.</i>

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

TURTLE-DOVES. Fully grown, not young.
YOUNG PIGEONS. Scripture reads <i>bene yonah</i> (young pigeons) because it wants to exclude fully grown pigeons. It therefore does not say <i>yonim</i> (pigeons).<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Which would indicate fully grown pigeons.</i>

Verse 15

PINCH. The word <i>malak</i> (pinch) has no brother in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The word is not found again in Scripture.</i> We know the laws of “pinching” from our tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohen</i> “cuts with his nail against the nape of the neck of the fowl and cuts its neck until he reaches the organs and severs them” (Rashi). Also see <i>Zevachim</i> 65a; <i>Chulin</i> 21b.</i>
AND THE BLOOD THEREOF SHALL BE DRAINED OUT. <i>Ve-nimtzah</i> (shall be drained out) is a <i>nifal</i>. It is related to the word <i>matzit</i> (drained) (Is. 51:17).

Verse 16

ITS CROP. The meaning of <i>murato</i> (its crop) is known.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Everybody knows that it refers to the crop.</i> The word <i>more’ah</i> (filthy) in <i>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted</i> (Zeph. 3:1) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The contents of the crop are filthy. Hence the term <i>murah</i> (crop).</i>
WITH THE FEATHERS THEREOF. The meaning of <i>be-not-zatah</i> is, with the feathers thereof.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">There is an opinion that <i>notzatah</i> means its entrails (see Rashi). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The word <i>notzah</i> (feathers) in <i>Full of feathers</i> (Ezek. 17:3) is similar.
BESIDE THE ALTAR. On the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Of the altar.</i>
ON THE EAST PART. For it is far from the place of the Glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The altar (Weiser). The crop and its feathers were not placed on the altar, but outside of it.</i>
IN THE PLACE OF THE ASHES. They shall also place it there.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Among the ashes, which were removed far away from the altar.</i>

Verse 17

AND HE SHALL REND IT. The word <i>ve-shissa</i> (and he shall rend it) is related to <i>ve-shosa’at shesa</i> (and is wholly cloven) (Lev. 11:3). The meaning of <i>shissa</i> is split.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

AND WHEN ANY ONE BRINGETH. The word <i>nefesh</i> (anyone) means a person. Scripture mentions <i>nefesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture here refers to a person by the term <i>nefesh</i>. However, in chapter 1, it refers to a person by the term <i>adam</i> (man). See Lev. 1:2. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> because the meal offering is a free will offering and <i>nefesh</i> is called “willing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nefesh</i> also means spirit.</i> Compare, <i>And let a willing spirit uphold me</i> (Ps. 51:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the deeper meaning of our verse is, when a willing spirit brings a free will offering unto the Lord. For another interpretation of why Scripture here employs the term <i>nefesh</i> and not <i>adam</i> see Rashi on verse 1.</i>
FINE FLOUR. The meaning of <i>solet</i> (fine flour) is pure wheat flour. It is the same as that which is called <i>samid</i> in Arabic. Look, it is not fitting that a meal offering brought to the Most High come from anything than which nothing better exists.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it is unfit that a meal offering brought to the Most High come from anything but the best.</i> What is the value of this work today? From an historical and intellectual view, Ibn Ezra’s commentary on the Pentateuch is most important, as explained previously in the preface to Genesis. His influence can be seen in all subsequent Hebrew Biblical commentaries, particularly that of Nahmanides. His influence is equally apparent on Maimonides both in his philosophical work, the <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i>, and his <i>halakhic</i> work, his <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, extending also to many later Biblical scholars and philosophers. All this is well documented in Dr. Strickman’s forewords to the five books of this set. In spite of all of this, however, the question of the English translation’s value still remains. In his introduction to his commentary on the Torah, Ibn Ezra writes, “With regard to verses which deal with laws, statutes and regulations, if we find two possible interpretations for a verse and one of them in keeping with the interpretation of the transmitters of tradition, all of whom were righteous men, then without reservation and with all our might we will rely on the truth of their words. Heaven forbid that we should join the Sadducees who claim that the traditions of the Rabbinic sages contradict the literal meaning of Scripture and the rules of grammar. The fact of the matter is that our ancient sages are true and all their words are true” (Vol. 1, pp. 18,19). However, it must be noted that the rabbis who posited post-Mosaic changes in the Torah were men of stellar reputation. Abarbanel (Num. 21:1) claimed, though his opinion is very questionable, that Nahmanides held such views regarding Num. 21:1-3. Furthermore, despite the fact that Maimonides’ thirteen principles of Judaism ultimately became part of the liturgy and thus were accepted at face value by all pious Jews, in practice not all of Maimonides’ pronouncements on what constitutes heresy were accepted by post-Maimonidian authorities. There was room for difference. For example, according to Maimonides one who directs his or her prayer to anyone but God is guilty of idol worship. Nevertheless, there are prayers that are directed to angels or to God’s attributes. Thus there had to be another reason for normative Judaism’s rejection of the notion of any post-Mosaic changes in the Torah.

Verse 2

AND HE SHALL TAKE. <i>Ve-kamatz</i> (and he shall take) is related to the word <i>li-kematzim</i> (in heaps) (Gen. 41:47).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation, <i>ve-kamatz</i> (and he shall take) means and he shall gather.</i> Our sages explained that <i>melo kumtzo</i> means a handful.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Menachot</i> 9a, 18b.</i> Their words are true.
OF THE FINE FLOUR THEREOF. A little of it, and so too of the oil. However, he shall burn all of the frankincense.
THE MEMORIAL-PART THEREOF. The <i>alef</i> of <i>azkaratah</i> (the memorial part thereof) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to this opinion <i>azkaratah</i> comes from the root <i>zayin, kaf, resh</i>. The <i>alef</i> serves no purpose.</i> <i>Azkaratah</i> is so called because the meal offering by the celebrant serves as a memorial before God.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>azkaratah</i> means <i>the memorial part thereof</i>. God recalls the celebrant because of his meal offering.</i> Others say that <i>azkaratah</i> means its scent. It is like scent of the incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The portion of the meal offering offered on the altar is similar to the incense offered on the altar.</i> Compare, <i>The scent thereof</i> (zikhro) <i>shall be as the wine of Lebanon</i> (Hos. 14:8).

Verse 3

SHALL BE AARON’S AND HIS SONS’. And to all <i>kohanim</i> equally.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the meal offerings that are baked in the oven which belong to the priest who offers them (Lev. 7:9), a meal offering mingled with oil is shared by all the <i>kohanim</i> (Lev. 7:10) (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 4

UNLEAVENED CAKES. The word <i>challot</i> (cakes) means thick cakes.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>challot matzot</i> (unleavened cakes) means thick unleavened cakes.</i> Others connect <i>challot</i> to the Rabbinic term <i>chalilah</i> (circle).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">They say that <i>challot</i> means rounded cakes. See <i>Sukkah</i> 5:6.</i>

Verse 11

LEAVEN. <i>Se’or</i> refers to leaven. It is the same case with honey. Some say that our verse speaks of date honey.

The latter seems to place honey among the produce of the field. Others say that the reference is to Neh. 10:36.</i>

Verse 12

AS AN OFFERING OF FIRST-FRUITS YE MAY BRING THEM UNTO THE LORD. As the two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah which were waved before God on the festival of Shavu’ot (Lev. 23:17). The meaning of <i>unto the Lord</i> is, even though they are holy <i>unto the Lord</i> they are food for the <i>kohen</i>.

Verse 13

THE COVENANT OF THY GOD. God caused you to enter the covenant and made you swear that you would not offer anything which is unsalted and inedible, for that is an insult.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">To God.</i>

IF ANY ONE SHALL SIN.

Verse 14

WHEN THE SIN WHEREIN THEY HAVE SINNED IS KNOWN. The same law,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A person shall bring a sin offering only after learning that he has sinned. The same law applies to the <i>kohen gadol</i>.</i> even though it is not mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture doesn’t state, “when their sin is known” in the law dealing with the <i>kohen gadol</i>.</i> applies to the <i>kohen gadol</i>, for if the sin not be known to the <i>kohen gadol</i>, then he does not bring a sin offering. Others say that the <i>kohen gadol</i> shall bring this sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A sin offering.</i> every year because he may have sinned.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture does not state “when the sin wherein he sinned is known” with regard to the <i>kohen gadol</i>.</i> Scripture mentions <i>the sin…is known</i> with regard to the whole congregation of Israel, for it is possible that the <i>kohen</i> will inform them. However, there is no one to inform the <i>kohen;</i> he informs himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohen gadol</i> realizes by himself that he has sinned.</i> The sin offering of the congregation is the same as that of the <i>kohen gadol</i> in all details.

Verse 21

IT IS THE SIN-OFFERING. The bullock.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>chattat ha-kahal hu. Hu</i> is in the masculine. Hence it refers to the bullock, not to the sin offering. Thus our text is to be understood as follows: The bullock is the sin offering of the assembly.</i> If Israel errs and they do not do one of the positive commandments, then they shall bring a bullock as a burnt offering and a he-goat as a sin offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Our text tells us that if the congregation sins in error they then bring a bullock as a sin offering. However, Num. 15:22-24 tells us that if the congregation sins in error they shall bring a bullock as a burnt offering and a he-goat as a sin offering. Hence I.E. points out that our text deals with the violation of a negative precept while Numbers deals with the violation of a positive precept, for the text reads, <i>and do any of the things which the Lord hath commanded not to be done</i> while Num. 15:22 reads, <i>and not observe all these commandments</i>.</i>

Verse 22

WHEN A RULER SINNETH. The words are inverted.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>asher nasi yechete</i> (when a ruler sinneth).</i> Our verse should be read as if written, when the sinner is the ruler.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our text should be interpreted as if written, <i>asher yechete nasi</i>. I.E. interprets thus because he believes that <i>asher</i> (when) is connected to the verb (<i>yechete</i>), not to the noun (<i>nasi</i>).</i> It is connected to that which is written above,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hence our verse does not open with <i>ve-im</i> (and if) but with <i>asher</i> (the one who).</i> that is, <i>And if the whole congregation of Israel…</i> (v. 13).

The verse speaks of those who walk haughtily. The he-goat walks with its head held high, as does the king. Hence a goat was chosen as the animal to be offered by the ruler (the king) as a sin offering.</i> The latter is in accordance with the interpretation of the Gaon in the Book of Proverbs. The offering consists of a male, in keeping with the status of the ruler. However, its blood is not brought inside of the sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to the blood of the bullock brought by the <i>kohen gadol</i> and the congregation.</i> The <i>kohanim</i>, as is stated in Scripture,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 6:19.</i> eat of the ruler’s sin offering to atone for the ruler.

Verse 1

The Lord commanded that the place where some of the blood of the sin offering fell on the garment be washed because the sin offering is holy.

Two: And when (<i>asher</i>) there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, the place where (<i>makom asher</i>) something is sprinkled upon it (the garment), you shall wash in a holy place.</i> It means: Or if someone shall sprinkle upon it, that is, upon the flesh, then the <i>kohen</i> shall wash the flesh and then eat it.

Morak</i> is vocalized with a <i>cholam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than with a <i>kubbutz</i>, as is the case in the <i>pu’al</i>.</i> because of the <i>resh</i> which, except in a few places,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>massorah</i> records seven instances in Scripture when a <i>dagesh</i> is placed in the <i>resh</i> (Krinsky).</i> does not receive a <i>dagesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>dagesh</i> is placed in the middle root letter in the <i>pu’al</i>. However, the <i>resh</i> does not receive a <i>dagesh</i>.

The one who offers the sacrifice, his family, and all who are clean shall eat it, for the peace offerings are also holy<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Hence only those who are clean may eat of it.</i> even though they are lesser holy offerings.

Verse 16

A VOW. A vow uttered by the lips when in trouble.
OR A FREEWILL-OFFERING. His sprit moved him to bring a sacrifice to God, not because he had made a vow, or for thanksgiving.
ON THE DAY THAT HE OFFERETH HIS SACRIFICE. The word <i>hakrivo</i> is an infinitive<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">With a pronominal suffix.</i> in the <i>hifil</i>.

Verse 17

SHALL BE BURNT WITH FIRE. Like the parts of a sacrifice which Scripture designates for burning. However, it should not be burned on the altar.

Verse 18

[NEITHER SHALL IT BE IMPUTED UNTO HIM THAT OFFERETH IT.] Its meaning is, since Scripture designates that specific parts of the sacrifice be offered to God, all that remains of the animal is holy. Similarly the stones of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The stones used in constructing the altar.</i> Since they are holy, it is unfit that anything that remains from them be used in a non-sacred way.

ABHORRED.

According to the law, the peace offerings must be holy. However that which is abhorred is not holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The slaughterer of the sacrifice disqualified the offering by intending during the slaughter to eat of the sacrifice on the third day.

Verse 19



Verse 20

[HAVING HIS UNCLEANLINESS.] This means if his uncleanliness comes from his body, as in the case of a flux<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>zav</i>.</i> or a leper.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>metzora</i>.</i> Also because of uncleanliness caused by a nocturnal emission, as Scripture states, <i>for he thought: Something</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">A nocturnal emission.</i> <i>hath befallen him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">And rendered him unclean.</i> (I Sam. 20:26). It also applies to uncleanliness that comes from contact with an outside source<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Coming into contact with an outside unclean source.</i> such as a dead body, or a living person who experienced a flux or is a leper, or an unclean beast which may not be eaten, or a detestable thing from among the fowl and that which swarms.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 1-31.</i> A Sadducee<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">A Karaite.</i> once came to me and asked, “Does the Torah prohibit the fat tail?”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The fat of the tail (Hebrew, <i>alyah</i>).</i> I answered that it is true that the fat tail is called “fat” (<i>chelev</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Fat is proscribed by Jewish law.</i> for the Torah states, <i>the fat thereof, the fat tail entire</i> (Lev. 3:9). However, while our sages prohibited all fat, they permitted the fat tail.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This statement was disconcerting among Biblical commentaries, for according to the Talmud all fat is prohibited by the Torah (not the sages), and the violator incurs the penalty of <i>karet</i>. Nahmanides charged that Ibn Ezra’s position is more heretical than that of the Karaites. Luzzato claimed that I.E. did not really believe that fat (<i>chelev</i>) is permitted. He was merely playing devil’s advocate. However, Nahmanides correctly interpreted Ibn Ezra. I.E. held that biblically speaking only the fat of an animal actually offered on the altar is prohibited. Other fat is prohibited by the rabbis. See I.E. on Deut. 12:15. The importance of I.E.’s comment on this verse for understanding Ibn Ezra’s approach to the <i>halakhah</i> is discussed in the introduction to this volume.</i> The Sadducee then replied, “Does not the Torah prohibit all fat? Indeed it is written, <i>that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood</i> (Lev. 3:17). The latter is preceded by Scripture’s statement, <i>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>).”I once again answered him that this verse<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 3:17.</i> relates to the peace offering. Also, the clause <i>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This clause may be taken to imply that the fat of animals not sacrificed is prohibited, for <i>throughout the generations</i> implies even in a time when the sanctuary no longer exists.</i> does not provide complete proof, for we see that Scripture states, <i>And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your God</i> (Lev. 23:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>omer</i>.</i> Now Scripture there writes, <i>it is a statute for ever</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). Shall we then not eat bread in the Diaspora? For we have not brought the <i>omer</i> offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>for ever</i> means as long as the sanctuary exits. Similarly <i>a perpetual statute</i>.</i> He, on his part, replied, “<i>Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat</i> (v. 23).”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaite assumed that this verse applies to all animals forever.</i> I again answered that this verse too refers to a peace offering. <i>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering</i> (v. 25) is proof, for the latter excludes the fat of all flesh which is not offered as a peace offering, that is, all secular meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">All non-sacrificed flesh.</i> Scripture therefore states in our section, <i>And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it</i> (v. 24). It is known<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">From earlier Biblical passages. See Ex. 22:30.</i> that the flesh of that which dies of itself and that which is torn of beasts is prohibited. It is the flesh that is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 22:30 speaks only of the flesh. The latter may be taken to imply that the fat of carrion or of an animal that dies of itself is permitted.</i> Now since the fat<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Of an animal that dies or is torn by another animal.</i> is not offered on the altar, one might think that it is permitted. Hence Scripture warns,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 24.</i> <i>but ye shall in no wise eat of it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The fat (<i>chelev</i>) of an animal that dies or is torn by another animal.</i> It is for this reason that Scripture does not mention the blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 24, for Scripture earlier prohibited the eating of blood.</i> This section<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 20-25.</i> was written in order to explain the punishment incurred by one who eats the fat of sacred flesh. The verse relating to <i>any blood</i> (v. 27) was similarly written to add that the blood of fowl is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise there would be no need for this verse, for Scripture earlier prohibited the blood of animals.</i> The fat of fowl is therefore permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Only the blood of fowl is spoken of in verse 27.

TO PRESENT THEIR OFFERINGS UNTO THE LORD, IN THE WILDERNESS OF SINAI. For Israel did not offer sacrifices until they came to Mount Sinai.

AND MOSES BROUGHT AARON’S SONS. Scripture notes this a second time<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">After stating this in verse 6.</i> because it speaks at length.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">About other things. In other words, after stating in verse 6 that Moses brought Aaron and his sons to the laver, Scripture drops Aaron’s sons and goes on to speak of Aaron and the tabernacle. Hence, now that it goes on to speak of Aaron’s sons, it once again mentions that Moses brought Aaron and his sons to the laver and goes on to say what followed then.</i> On the other hand, this means that when Moses brought Aaron’s sons he dressed them in tunics.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>va-yakrev</i> here does not mean and brought. Rather it means when he brought. In this case there is no repetition in our verse.</i> The word <i>va-yalbishem</i> (and clothed them) is a verb that governs two actions.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It is a <i>hifil</i>. Moses caused them to be dressed, and they were dressed.</i>

Verse 16

AND HE TOOK ALL THE FAT THAT WAS UPON THE INWARDS. Scripture earlier stated, <i>the fat that covereth the inwards</i> (Lev. 7:3) Another verse states, <i>the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards</i> (Lev. 3:3). Note, the <i>fat that covereth</i> [<i>the inwards</i> ] is substantial. However, the <i>fat that is upon the inwards</i> consists of a little from here and there.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It is not part of the layer of fat that covers the inwards.</i> That which <i>covereth</i> [<i>the inwards</i> ] is also <i>upon the inwards</i>. Hence Scripture employed abridged terminology.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse only speaks of <i>the fat that was upon the inwards</i>. The latter can be taken to refer to itself and also to <i>the fat that covereth the inwards</i>, for they are located in the same place.</i>

Verse 17

ONE UNLEAVENED CAKE. The reference is to <i>the one loaf</i> (kikkar) <i>of bread</i> (Ex. 29:2s).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kikkar</i> usually refers to leavened bread. Hence I.E. explains that Ex 29:3 is to be understood as the one loaf of unleavened bread.

AND PLACED THEM ON THE FAT. Scripture does not mention the lobe<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>yoteret</i>.</i> of the liver and the kidneys, for the lobe was small. The meaning of <i>yoteret</i> (lobe) is similar to the meaning of the word <i>yitron</i> (profit)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Or addition.</i> in <i>What profit hath man</i> (Eccles. 1:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yoteret</i> means the addition [to the liver].</i> The kidneys<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in verse 25.</i> are offered with their fat,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse states, <i>and placed them on the fat.

Verse 27

HE SHALL CONSECRATE YOU. The word <i>ketz</i> (end) was omitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">From the last clause in our verse. The latter reads, <i>ki shivat yamim yemalle et yodkham</i> (for he shall consecrate you seven days). The verse may be taken to read, for seven days shall consecrate you.

Verse 34

AS HATH BEEN DONE THIS DAY.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, as he did this day.</i> This means, as Moses did on this day, so God commanded to be done during the seven days of consecration. Scripture should have read, as I<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Moses.</i> did.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than as he (Moses) did.</i> However, such is the style of the holy tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Biblical characters occasionally refer to themselves in the third person.</i> Compare, <i>Thus shall Ezekiel he unto you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel refers to himself in the third person.</i> (Ezek. 24:24); <i>and Jephthah, and Samuel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel refers to himself in the third person.</i> (I Sam. 12:11).

It is possible that I.E. erred, for I.E. wrote many of his comments without a text of Scripture before him and he didn’t always edit his works. On the other hand, it is possible that I.E. was of the opinion that the blood of both rams was placed on Aaron and his sons even though Scripture only mentions it with regard to the second ram. Weiser suggests that our reading is due to an error by a copyist. Rabbi Shemu’el Tzartza believes that “I believe, etc.” is a gloss that found its way into I.E.’s commentary.</i> and the second ram’s flesh was to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 29:32.</i> However, the sin offering bullock was to consecrate the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The two rams are not mentioned in Ex. 29:36 because the latter speaks only of consecrating the altar.</i> Scripture clearly states, <i>al hakippurim</i> (beside the other offerings of atonement) (Ex. 29:36), the meaning of which is, for atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that the bullock was offered on the altar to atone, i.e., to purify the altar in order to consecrate it, while the rams were part of the consecration ritual of Aaron and his sons.

Verse 35

Verse 7

AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THYSELF, AND FOR THE PEOPLE. There is a divine command that you make atonement for yourself and for all of the people. You will atone for yourself with a sin offering bullock.

Verse 15

AND THE PEOPLE’S OFFERING WAS PRESENTED.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>va-yakrev</i> (literally, and he brought).

Verse 24

THE BURNT-OFFERING. The burnt offering of Aaron, the burnt offering of the people, and the continual burnt offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>olat tamid</i>.</i> for Scripture states, <i>beside the burnt-offering of the morning</i> (Num. 28:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The full verse reads, <i>Ye shall offer these</i> (the festival offerings) <i>beside the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering</i>.

AND THE FAT. From the bull-calf and the ram of Aaron, and the he-goat, the ox, and the ram
THEY SHOUTED. <i>Va-yaronnu</i> (they shouted) means they raised their voices. Compare, <i>rinnah</i> (cry) in <i>And there went a cry throughout the host</i> (I Kings 22:36).

AND THEY DIED BEFORE THE LORD. They thought that they were doing something favorable before Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Before the Lord</i> means serving God. Their intention was to serve God.</i>

Verse 4

CARRY YOUR BRETHREN FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY. Some say<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.

Verse 5



Verse 6

LET NOT THE HAIR OF YOUR HEADS GO LOOSE. Some say that <i>tifra’u</i> (go loose) means to let the hair grow long.
REND. The word <i>tifromu</i> means rend.

Hence the difference of opinion regarding the latter has no bearing on the definition of <i>tifra’u</i> (Meijler).</i>
THAT YE DIE NOT. The word <i>ve-lo</i> (that…not) is to be read as if written twice. Compare, <i>And I have not learned wisdom</i> (Prov. 30:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 30:3 literally reads: “I have not learned wisdom, I have knowledge of the Holy One.” According to I.E. this should be read, I have not (<i>lo</i>) learned wisdom, I have no (<i>lo</i>) knowledge of the Holy One.</i> Our verse is to be understood as follows: and that He be not wroth with all the congregation,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>ve’al kol ha-edah yiktzof</i>. The latter literally reads, and that He be wroth with all the congregation. That makes no sense in this context.

[BUT LET YOUR BRETHREN, THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL.] You will find the meaning of this alluded to in the Torah portion <i>Behold, I Set</i> (Deut. 11:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear what I.E. is referring to. Weiser suggests that I.E. intended to allude to our verse in his comments on the Torah portion <i>Re’eh</i>, but did not follow through on his intention.</i>

Verse 8

AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO AARON. For Aaron was a prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 31:18 (Vol. 2, p. 655).</i> Others say through Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">God spoke to Aaron through the agency of Moses.</i> as in <i>And the Lord spoke again unto Ahaz</i> (Is. 7:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">God spoke to Ahaz through the agency of Isaiah.

Verse 9

NOR STRONG DRINK. Made from any kind of wheat, honey, or dates, for wine destroys the reason of the one who imbibes it and he confuses things. Hence Scripture states, <i>And that ye may put difference</i> (v. 10).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since you must differentiate between the holy and the profane you must be able to think clearly. In most of the editions, “hence” opens a new comment on verse 10. However, Sarim’s edition has the comment as a continuation of verse 9.

Verse 10

AND BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN AND THE CLEAN. Among cattle and things that swarm in the water and that fly. Therefore the section opening with the words <i>These are the living things</i> (Lev. 10:11), and then the sections dealing with the woman who gives birth (Lev. 12:1-8) and the leprosy that is found in humans (Lev. 13:1-46), on garments (Lev. 13:47-59) and in houses (Lev. 14:33-53); one who experiences a seminal emission (Lev. 15:16-18); a male or female who experiences a flux (Lev. 15:1-15, 25-33); and a menstruant (Lev. 15:19-24) follow this section. This is the meaning of <i>and between the unclean and the clean</i>.

Verse 11

AND THAT YE MAY TEACH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The rest of the commandments. Similarly <i>and do according to all that the priests…shall teach you</i> (Deut. 24:8).

Verse 12

TAKE THE MEAL-OFFERING.

The <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The interrogative <i>heh</i>.</i> is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> because two mobile <i>shevas</i> cannot come back to back.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The interrogative <i>heh</i> is vocalized with a <i>chataf pattach</i>. However, when the interrogative <i>heh</i> precedes a letter vocalized by a <i>sheva na</i> (a mobile <i>sheva</i>), it is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>, for the <i>chataf pattach</i> has a <i>sheva na</i> within it and two mobile <i>shevas</i> cannot follow each other.</i> Now, since they<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The grammarians.</i> found that the <i>yod</i> of <i>ha-yitav</i> (would it have been well pleasing) has a <i>dagesh</i> in it, they said that the <i>heh</i> of <i>ha-yitav</i> is the <i>heh</i> which indicates the direct object,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>heh</i> of <i>ha-yitav</i> is not an interrogative <i>heh</i>.</i> like the <i>heh</i> of <i>ha-shavah</i> (that came) in <i>that came back with Naomi</i> (Ruth 2:6); the <i>heh</i> in <i>ha-nimtze’u foh</i> (that are found here) (I Chron. 29:17); the <i>heh</i> in <i>ha-hullalah</i> (the renowned) in <i>The renowned city</i> (Ezek. 26:17).

Verse 13

THE GREAT VULTURE The meaning of <i>nesher</i> (the great vulture) is known. This is also the bird which has the same name in the language of the Ishmaelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">It is called <i>niser</i> in Arabic. Hence we have additional proof of the identity of this bird.</i> There is something of a proof that this is the case, because the two languages are related.
AND THE OSPRAY. Even though there is an individual opinion that it (the osprey) is not found in inhabited places, the Gaon erred in rendering it <i>al enka</i>, for this term in the language of the Ishmaelites refers to something that never existed. It refers to something that was not created and never was. It is only employed metaphorically. The Arab grammarians admit this. This being the case, it is not possible that the Torah would prohibit something that never existed.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the first quoted opinion is superior to that of the Gaon.</i>

Verse 14

AND THE KITE. The term <i>da’ah</i> (kite) is a general term which takes in two kinds, namely, the <i>da’ah</i> (kite) and the <i>dayyah</i> (falcon).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Which is not in our verse but is mentioned in Deut. 14:13. <i>Vat.

Thus there is no contradiction between the list of the 20 prohibited birds in our chapter and the 21 in Deut. 14. Also, see I.E. on Deut. 14:11 (Vol. 5, pp. 93,94).</i> Compare, <i>tzippor</i> (birds), the word used for a turtle-dove and a young pigeon in <i>but the birds divided he not</i> (Gen. 15:10).

Verse 15

<i>orev</i> (raven) is related to the word <i>erev</i> (evening). It is so called because of its darkness.

Verse 16

AND THE OSTRICH. Some say that the <i>bat ha-ya’anah</i> (ostrich)<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bat ha-ya’anah</i> is feminine.</i> is a kind among whom males are not found.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture mentions only the feminine.</i> It is like the hare. There is no argument from the word <i>ka-ye’enim</i> (like the ostriches)<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ye’enim</i> is a masculine plural form. The singular of this form is <i>ya’an</i>.

AND THE NIGHT-HAWK. <i>Tachmas</i> (night-hawk) is related to the word <i>chamas</i> (violence) (Gen. 5:11).
THE SEA-MEW. The <i>shachaf</i> (sea-mew) gives birth to consumption (<i>shachefet</i>) (Lev. 26:16).
AND THE HAWK. The <i>netz</i> (hawk) has many feathers.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for feather is <i>notzah</i>.</i> It most likely refers to the well-known bird which always spreads its wings to the south,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Job 39:26, <i>Doth the hawk</i> (netz) <i>soar by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south</i>?</i> for it seeks a warm place.

Verse 17

AND THE LITTLE OWL. The word <i>kos</i> (little owl) is similar to the word <i>kos</i> (owl) in <i>as an owl of the waste places</i> (Ps. 102:7). Some say that the bird is hidden (<i>nikhseh</i>) from the eyes of people. It therefore rests in uninhabited places.
AND THE CORMORANT. Some say that the <i>shalakh</i> (cormorant) is so called because its nature is to cast (<i>le-haslikh</i>) its offspring down.
AND THE GREAT OWL. The <i>yanshuf</i> (great owl) is a bird that flies at night (<i>neshef</i>), for it cannot see during the day because of the brightness of the sun light.

Verse 18

AND THE HORNED OWL. Whoever looks at the <i>tinshemet</i> (the horned owl) is astonished (<i>yishom</i>). The term <i>tinshemet</i> is also found among the swarming things (v. 30).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>tinshemet</i> refers to both a bird and a reptile. This is an anomaly which I.E. points out.</i>
AND THE PELICAN. Some say that the <i>ka’at</i> (pelican) is a bird whose nature is to regurgitate (<i>le-haki</i>) its food.
AND THE CARRION-VULTURE. The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> says that the <i>racham</i> (carrion-vulture) is the animal which is similarly called in Arabic,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>rakham</i>.</i> with the <i>chet</i> interchanging with a <i>khaf</i>, for they are written with the same letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Arabic <i>chet</i> and <i>khaf</i> are similarly writtten.</i> Others say that <i>racham</i> refers to a bird that has pity (<i>merachem</i>) upon its offspring.

Verse 19

AND THE STORK. Some say the <i>chasidah</i> (stork) is the bird which appears at certain well-known times in the year. Others say that it scatters loving kindness (<i>chesed</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi: “Why is it called “<i>chasidah</i>? It is so called because it acts kindly towards its fellow creatures with regard to food.” See also <i>Chullin</i> 63a.</i> This is far-fetched.
AND THE HERON. The <i>anafah</i> (heron) grows angry (<i>yitannef</i>) quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Chullin</i> 63a.</i>
AND THE HOOPOE. The Sadducees say that the <i>dukhifat</i> (hoopoe) refers to the chicken. However, they are the world’s greatest fools, for who told them this?
AND THE BAT. A small bird that flies at night. The word <i>atalef</i> (bat) is a quadriliteral; that is, it comes from a four-letter root. 
Note that the word <i>teshakketzu</i> in <i>teshakketzu min ha-of</i> (these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls) (v. 13) has a slightly different grammatical meaning from <i>teshakketzu</i> in <i>al teshakketzu et nafshotekhem</i> (ye shall not make yourselves detestable) (v. 43). In the latter instance the word <i>nafshotekhem</i> (yourselves) is the object, while in the case of the fowl (v. 13) its meaning is, you shall know that they are detestable and they shall be considered detestable to you. All winged swarming things that at times fly and at times go upon all fours are detestable.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of verse 20.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

WHICH HAVE JOINTED LEGS. The main reading is the one that spells <i>lo</i> with a <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kre</i>. The <i>ketiv</i> spells <i>lo</i> with a <i>vav</i>. With a <i>vav</i> the phrase means “which have jointed legs;” without a <i>vav</i> it reads, “which does not have jointed legs.” According to the rabbis the meaning of the latter is: which does not have jointed legs now but will grow them later. See <i>Sifra</i> on this verse.</i>
TO LEAP. The word <i>le-natter</i> has no brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The word is not found again in Scripture.</i> The Aramaic translator renders <i>le-natter ba-hen</i> by <i>le-kappatza behen;</i> since the word <i>le-kappatza</i> is similar to <i>mekappetz</i> (leaping) (Cant. 2:8),<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>le-kappatza ve-hon</i> means wherewith to leap.</i> its meaning is leaping. He translated correctly.

Verse 22

[THE LOCUST.] The word <i>arbeh</i> (locust) is connected to the word <i>ribbuy</i> (large amount).
AND THE BALD LOCUST. The <i>sale’am</i> (bald locust) refers to a kind of locust which climbs on rocks (<i>sela’im</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sela</i> means a rock. Thus <i>sela’im</i> means the “rocker,” i.e., the grasshopper that climbs a rock.</i>
AND THE CRICKET. If the word <i>chargol</i> (cricket) is a quadriliteral, then it has no brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">There is no similar word in Scripture.</i> If it is a combination of two words<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Charag</i> (trembling). See I. E. on Ps. 18:46 and <i>regel</i> (foot).</i> like the word <i>palmoni</i> (certain one) in <i>unto that certain one who spoke</i> (Dan 8:13), then the nature of the <i>chargal</i> is the reverse of the nature of the <i>sale’am</i> (bald locust).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>sale’am</i> climbs rocks while the <i>chargal</i> has “trembling feet” and is not adept at climbing.</i>
AND THE GRASSHOPPER. Its meaning is known from the language of the Ishmaelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">A grasshopper is called <i>chajaba</i> in Arabic.</i>

Verse 23

[BUT ALL WINGED SWARMING THINGS.] Scripture had previously stated, <i>that go upon all fours</i> (v. 20).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture had previously stated that <i>go on all four are…detestable</i> (v. 21). Why then state here, <i>But all winged swarming things which have four feet are…detestable</i>?</i> The Torah now states, <i>But all winged swarming things, which have four feet</i>, because it is possible that there is a swarming creature that has four legs but that does not walk upon them but only flies.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20 teaches that a swarming creature that walks on four legs is detestable. Our verse teaches that a swarming creature that has four legs is detestable even if it does not walk upon them. Our verse thus not repeat verse 20.</i>

Verse 24

AND BY THESE YE SHALL BECOME UNCLEAN. By all winged swarming things that have four feet; <i>And these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 13. In other words, verses 24 and 25 refer to that which comes before, that is to unclean fowl and unclean winged swarming things.</i> Others believe that the word <i>elleh</i> (these) (v. 24) refers to <i>among all the beasts</i> and to <i>And whatsoever goeth upon its paws</i> (v. 27).<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, verses 23 and 24 introduce that which follows. See Rashi and Rashbam.</i> I believe that the word <i>elleh</i> refers to all those mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Unclean fowl and unclean winged swarming things.</i>
YE SHALL BECOME UNCLEAN. The word <i>tittamma’u</i> (ye shall become unclean) is a <i>hitpa’el</i>. The <i>tet</i> receives a <i>dagesh</i> because the <i>tav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Of the <i>hitpa’el</i>.</i> is swallowed. The same is the case with the word <i>middabber</i> (speaking) in <i>then he heard the Voice speaking unto him</i> (Num. 7:89) and the word <i>mittaher</i> (cleansed) in <i>And he that is to be cleansed shall wash</i> (Lev. 14:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Both words are <i>hitpa’els</i> whose <i>tav</i> is compensated for by a <i>dagesh</i>.</i>
SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. Scripture chose the path of brevity, for the unclean must bathe in water.

Verse 25

AND WHOSOEVER BEARETH. Bearing is more serious than touching. Therefore the bearer must wash his garments. How much more so [must he bathe] his body. The same law applies to all beasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">It does not apply only to unclean fowl and unclean winged swarming things.</i> Scripture also follows the path of brevity here.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">As it did in verse 24.</i> The verse is to be understood as follows, or is clovenfooted but cheweth not the cud or cheweth the cud but is not cloven-footed.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse seems to imply that only an animal that has two signs of uncleanliness is unclean, for it speaks of a <i>beast which parteth the hoof, but is not cloven-footed, nor cheweth the cud</i>. However, this contradicts verses 4-7 which teache that an animal with only one kosher sign is unclean. Hence I.E. points out that the above clause is short for: a beast which cheweth the cud and parteth the hoof but is not cloven-footed, or a beast that cheweth not the cud but which parteth the hoof and is cloven-footed.</i> Scripture has previously stated, <i>and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you</i> (v. 8).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture does not mention here that their carcasses are unclean (Weiser).</i>

Verse 26

[EVERY ONE THAT TOUCHETH THEM.] This means everyone who touches any of the above-mentioned carcasses shall become unclean until the evening, for that is the law regarding the previously mentioned carcasses. There is a type of misbeliever who belongs to the Sadducee heresy who says that <i>every one that toucheth them</i> means whoever touches them while they are alive shall be unclean. There is no need to respond to insane talk, for Scripture only prohibited their flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">To be eaten. The point is that the law dealing with touching unclean animals only concerns dead unclean animals, for Scripture explicitly states, <i>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</i> (v. 8). Hence the prohibition against touching unclean animals applies only to their carcasses.</i> It states, <i>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</i> (v. 8).

Verse 27

AND WHATSOEVER GOETH UPON ITS PAWS. At first<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Before they died.</i> the law is the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">They have the same law as the animals mentioned in verse 26.</i> Similarly <i>And he that beareth the carcass of them</i> (v. 28).<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The law that governs the animals mentioned in verse 28 applies here too.</i> This verse affirms my explanation of the words <i>And by these ye shall be come unclean</i> (v. 24),<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>And by these ye shall be come unclean</i> applies to what comes before, not what follows. See I.E. on verse 24.</i> for Scripture there states, <i>And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them</i> (v. 25).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">And verse 28 states, <i>And</i> <i>he that beareth the carcass of them</i>. According to I.E., Scripture is not repeating itself, for verse 25 refers to winged creatures while verse 28 refers to animals that walk on all fours.</i> Both of them are in one section. 
The reason Scripture states, <i>They are unclean unto you</i>, is that it wants to include all of Israel: men, women, and children.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26 states, <i>Every one that toucheth them shall be unclean</i>. Hence <i>unclean unto you</i> in our verse is not a mere repetition of the same statement.</i> One law applies to all.

Verse 29

The meaning of <i>shall be unclean until the even</i> is, after he bathes he shall be unclean until the evening.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 25.</i>

Verse 32

IT MUST BE PUT INTO WATER. The garment or the sack or the vessel which is susceptible of uncleanness.

[AND HE THAT EATETH.] The law regarding he that eats<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Of the carcass of the animal that dies of itself.</i> is stricter.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Than the law regarding one who touches.</i> It is similar to the law governing he that that carries,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">The carcass of the animal that dies of itself.</i> for both bear.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">The carcass.</i> One carries outside<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">On the outside of the body.</i> and the other<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">The one who eats.</i> inside.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Of his or her body.</i> 

Verse 41

[AND EVERY SWARMING THING.] This means all swarming things of the earth.

Verse 42

THE BELLY. The word <i>gachon</i> (belly) is similar to the word <i>gechonekha</i> (thy belly) in <i>upon thy belly shalt thou go</i> (Gen. 3:14).
AND WHATSOEVER GOETH UPON ALL FOURS. Among the swarming things which are small, as I explained with regard to the swarming things in the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 10.</i>
MANY FEET. The word <i>marbeh</i> (many) is an adjective. It is in the construct.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">With <i>raglayim</i> (feet).</i>

Verse 43

YE SHALL NOT MAKE YOURSELVES DETESTABLE. By being filthy and dirty.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">By eating filthy and dirty things.</i>

THAT YE SHOULD BE DEFILED THEREBY. The word <i>ve-nitmetem</i> (that ye should be defiled) is missing an <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nitmetem</i> is spelled <i>nun, tet, mem, tav, mem</i>.

Verse 44

YE SHALL THEREFORE BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY. Hence I told you <i>neither shall ye defile yourselves</i> (v. 44).

Verse 45

[FOR I AM THE LORD.] This means I did not take you out of Egypt for any reason but to be your God. If you will not be holy, I will not be a God to you. Hence if you want Me to be your God you must be holy.

Verse 1



Verse 2

IF A WOMAN BE DELIVERED.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tazri’a</i> (literally, produces a seed).</i> After Scripture concludes the law of clean and unclean food, it deals with human uncleanliness. The Torah starts<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Its regulations of human uncleanliness.</i> with the woman who gives birth, because human life begins at birth. Many say that if the woman produces the seed first,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Before the male.</i> then she gives birth to a male.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">However, when the male produces the seed first then the result is a female. See <i>Berakhot</i> 60a; <i>Niddah</i> 28a.</i> Scripture therefore states, <i>and bear a man-child</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Scripture therefore says, If a woman produce seed and bear a man-child.</i> The wise men of the Greeks similarly believed that the seed is of the woman. The seed of the male congeals.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Greeks believed that the male seed gives form to the seed of the woman.</i> All of the child is created out of the blood of the woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Greek sages the woman provides the matter and the man the form of the embryo. See I.E. on Deut. 13:7 (Vol. 5, pp. 89,90).</i> Note, the meaning of <i>tazri’a</i> (be delivered) means will give seed, for a woman<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>he</i> (she) as in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 rather than <i>hu</i> (it) as in some printed editions.</i> is like the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the field nurtures the seed planted in it. The same is the case with a woman. Compare, <i>And as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it</i> (zeru’ehah) <i>to spring forth</i> (Is. 62:11). Thus <i>ishah ki tazri’a</i> (if a woman be delivered) literally means if a woman gives forth her seed, i.e., the seed planted in her.</i> 
The <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-tame’ah</i> (then shall be unclean) is like the unaspirated <i>vav</i> in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It does not always indicate the start of a new clause. See I.E. on Gen. 1:2 (Vol. 1, p. 30). In other words, <i>ve-tame’ah</i> is not to be rendered: and she shall be unclean, but, then she shall be unclean.</i> The reason that she is unclean for seven days is that she must wait until she completes<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, returns to.</i> a quarter of days.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The month is divided into quarters. According to the astrologers there is a change in nature and in fate at the end of each quarter.

THE IMPURITY OF. The word <i>niddat</i> (impurity of) is a noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In the construct.</i> It follows the paradigm of <i>bizzat</i> (spoil of).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The word is not found in the Bible.

Bizzat</i> from <i>bet, zayin, zayin</i>.</i>
HER SICKNESS. <i>Devotah</i> (her sickness) is a noun in the plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It’s the plural of <i>davah</i> plus the feminine pronominal suffix.</i> Compare, <i>madveh</i> (diseases) in <i>the evil diseases of Egypt</i> (Deut. 7:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devotah</i> (her sickness) and <i>madveh</i> (diseases) come from the same root. Thus <i>devotah</i> means her illness. Some interpret <i>devotah</i> as her flow.

See Rashi, “No woman sees a flow of blood…without first experiencing a heaviness in her head and limbs.”</i>

Verse 3

SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED. <i>Yimmol</i> (shall be circumcised) is a <i>nifal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>mem, vav, lamed</i>.</i> Compare, <i>yikkon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>kaf, vav, nun</i>.</i> (be established) in <i>shall not be established</i> (Ps. 101:7). According to this opinion, <i>yimmol</i> is related to the word <i>mullim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>mem, vav, lamed</i>.</i> (circumcised) in <i>were circumcised</i> (Josh. 5:5). It is also possible that <i>yimmol</i> is missing a <i>nun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In this case <i>yimmol</i> comes from the root <i>nun, mem. lamed</i>.</i> and is related to the word <i>u-nemaltem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, mem, lamed</i>.</i> (and ye shall be circumcised) (Gen. 17:11). <i>Yimmol</i> is like the word <i>yiddor</i> (voweth)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, dalet, resh</i>.</i> in <i>When a man voweth a vow unto the Lord</i> (Num. 30:3).

In this case the subject is missing, for Scripture omits who “he” is. Hence I.E. points out that “he” refers to the father of the child, the Beth Din, or any authorized person. For similar comments of I.E., see I.E. on Gen. 25:26; 48:1; 50:26 (Vol. 1, pp. 251, 412, 452).</i>
HIS FORESKIN.

When the word <i>orlah</i> (foreskin) stands by itself, it refers to the foreskin of the penis. When Scripture uses the term <i>orlah</i> metaphorically, it connects it to another word, as in <i>aral sefatayim</i> (of uncircumcised lips) (Ex. 6:12).</i>

His point is that our verse reads “a man,” not an Israelite.</i> because it wants to include strangers.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Sifra</i>, Scripture employs the term “man” because the latter includes converts to Judaism.

QUICK. The meaning of <i>michyat</i> (quick) is live flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>basar chai</i> (raw flesh; literally, live flesh) explains <i>michyat</i> (quick).</i> Flesh which does not feel is not alive.

<i>Yasgirennu</i> (shut him up) governs two actions.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s term for the <i>hifil</i>.</i> It means he shall command that the afflicted be shut up.

Verse 12



Verse 13

HE SHALL PRONOUNCE HIM CLEAN THAT HATH THE PLAGUE. For the plague has already surfaced and removed itself from the afflicted. The meaning of <i>ve-tiher et hanaga</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and he shall clean the malady.</i> (he shall pronounce him unclean that hath the plague) is that he shall verbally clean the affliction; that is, he shall declare that this plague will not make others unclean.

Verse 18



Verse 19

REDDISH-WHITE. A mixture of the two colors. Or a little of each. 
The word <i>tzara’at</i> (leprosy) (v. 20) means a disease. Similarly <i>ha-tzirah</i> (the disease)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> in <i>I will send the disease</i> (Ex. 23:28).

There are some who argue that the term “sent” (<i>shalach</i>) applies only to living things. They translate <i>ha-tizirah</i> (the disease) in Ex. 23:28 as the hornet. They render Ex. 23:28 as <i>I will send the hornet</i>.</i> for Scripture reads, <i>He sent His word</i> (Ps. 107:20); <i>For I…send all My plagues</i> (Ex. 9:14); and <i>He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger</i> (Ps. 78:49).

SCAR. The word <i>tzarevet</i> (scar) is similar to the word <i>ve-nitzrevu</i> (shall be seared) in <i>and all faces…shall be seared</i> (Ezek. 21:30).

The word <i>kehah</i> (dim) is to be understood as I explained it earlier (v. 6).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>kehah</i> means be diminished.</i> Scripture does not mention <i>kehah</i> (dim) the first time, <i>But if the bright spot stay in its place</i> (v. 23), because there the bright spot remains as it was.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 23 if the affliction remains as it was, it is declared clean.

Verse 30

YELLOW. The word <i>tzahov</i> (yellow) in Arabic refers to a color that is close to white.
IT IS A SCALL. The word <i>netek</i> (scall) is related to the word <i>yennatek</i> (is broken) in <i>as a string of tow is broken</i> (Jud. 16:9).

Verse 33

THEN HE SHALL BE SHAVEN. The head or the beard shall be shaven. However, the place of the <i>netek</i> (scall) shall not be shaven.

Verse 34

AND HE SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES. It is unnecessary to say that he shall bathe in water.

Verse 35



Verse 36

SHALL NOT SEEK. The meaning of <i>yevakker</i> is, he shall seek. Similarly <i>u-vikkartim</i> (and seek them out) (Ezek. 34:11). It is close in meaning to the word separate.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">It means to investigate in order to separate.</i> Similarly <i>He shall not inquire</i> (yevakker) <i>whether it be good or bad</i> (Lev. 27:33).

Verse 39

A TETTER. The word <i>bohak</i> (tetter) is known in Rabbinic literature.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">It has the meaning of shine or glisten. See <i>Yershalmi, Pes</i>. 1: “When the candles burned brightly (<i>mavhikim</i>).”</i> It has no counterpart in Scripture.

Verse 40

BE FALLEN OFF. <i>Yimmaret</i> (be fallen off) is similar to <i>moretim</i> (them that plucked off the hair) in <i>And my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair</i> (Is. 50:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Both words come from the root <i>mem, resh, tet</i> and have a similar meaning.</i> The latter<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the similar word in our verse, which refers to the hair on the head.</i> refers to the hair that is around the cheeks.
HE IS BALD. <i>Kere’ach</i> (bald) is similar to <i>korchah</i> (baldness) in <i>nor make any baldness</i> (Deut. 14:1). The meaning of <i>his head</i> is, his entire head.

Verse 41

FOREHEAD-BALD. The word <i>gibbe’ach</i> (forehead-bald) has no neighbor<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>gibbe’ach</i> is not found elsewhere in Scripture.</i> except in this section. <i>Gibbe’ach</i> is an adjective.

Verse 44



Verse 45

HIS CLOTHES SHALL BE RENT. The word <i>perumim</i> means rent. The leper is to be so dressed so that he may be recognized because of his abnormal garb. Or the leper is to behave like a mourner. Scripture therefore states, <i>his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose</i>. The reason for the latter is so that the leper mourn for his evil actions, for this plague came upon him because of his deeds.
HIS UPPER LIP. <i>Safam</i> refers to the upper lip. The <i>mem</i> of <i>safam</i> is a root letter. The word <i>sefamo</i> (his beard) in <i>nor trimmed his beard</i> (II Sam. 19:22)<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders this as <i>nor trimmed his upper lip</i>.</i> is proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>mem</i> of <i>safam</i> were not a root letter, then it would not be present when the word is followed by a pronominal suffix.</i>

The word <i>yateh</i> (he shall cover) is related to the word <i>oteh</i> (coverest) in <i>Who coverest Thyself with light</i> (Ps. 104:2). He shall cover his upper lip so that he does not harm anyone with the breath of his mouth.
AND…UNCLEAN. The word <i>unclean</i> is repeated.

Verse 48

OR IN THE WARP, OR IN THE WOOF. The meaning of <i>sheti</i> (warp) and <i>erev</i> (woof) is known.

Verse 51

MALIGNANT. The word <i>mameret</i> (malignant) is similar to the word <i>mammir</i> (pricking) in <i>a pricking brier</i> (sillon mamir) (Ezek. 28:24).

The Gaon says that <i>karachat</i> refers to the underside of the garment, for <i>gabachat</i> refers to the face of the garment. If this is the case, then the word <i>kere’ach</i> (bald) (v. 40) refers to the back of the head. He explained well.

Verse 56



Verse 57

Verse 58

THEN IT SHALL BE WASHED THE SECOND TIME. There is divine command to wash it twice.
IF THE PLAGUE BE DEPARTED FROM THEM. <i>Ve-sar me-hem ha-naga</i> means if the plague be departed from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Not and the affliction will depart from them.</i> I have previously shown you many such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Where the <i>vav</i> does not mean and, but indicates the pluperfect.</i>

Chapter 14



Verse 1

[AND THE LORD SPOKE.] Scripture states <i>and the Lord spoke</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Our chapter continues the theme of the preceding chapter. Thus the statement <i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses</i> in Lev. 13:1 would appear to apply to our chapter as well. Therefore the clause <i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses</i> in Lev. 14:1 seems unnecessary. Hence I.E. points out that our portion begins with <i>And the Lord spoke</i> because it contains a new commandment, <i>viz</i>., the laws of the cleansing of the leper. In other words, our chapter is not a mere continuation of what came before it.</i> because it begins the laws of the one who is cleansed. Rabbi Jonah the Spaniard, the grammarian, says that <i>and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper</i> (v. 3) is inverted. It should have read “and, behold, if the leper be healed from the plague of leprosy.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our verse should be interpreted as if written, if the leper be healed from the plague of leprosy, for according to Rabbi Jonah it is the person not the plague who is healed.</i>

Verse 41

AND HE SHALL CAUSE THE HOUSE TO BE SCRAPED. The word <i>yaktzi’a</i> (he shall cause…to be scraped) is related to the word <i>maktzu’ot</i> (planes) (Is. 44:13) and the word <i>ketzi’ot</i> (cassia) in <i>Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia</i> (Ps. 45:9). The meaning of <i>ketz’ot</i> (cassia) is cuttings.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">He renders <i>yaktzi’a</i> he shall cut.</i> Some say the corner<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>miktzo’a</i> (corner).</i> shall be peeled.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>yaktzi’a</i> is, they shall peel the corner.

Verse 1

AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND TO AARON. For the <i>kohanim</i> distinguish between a woman who has an issue (<i>zavah</i>) and one who menstruates (<i>niddah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hence this commandment was also communicated to Aaron.</i> Compare the Rabbinic interpretation on <i>between blood and blood</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 17:8-9 states that if there be a dispute regarding <i>blood and blood</i> then the <i>kohen</i> shall decide the aforementioned. The Rabbis interpret <i>between blood and blood</i> as meaning between “between menstrual blood and blood of an issue and blood of childbirth (<i>Sifre</i>, on Deut. 17:8).”</i> (Deut. 17:8). Scripture now begins to deal with those who become unclean from a hidden source,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Such as an issue.</i> for until now it dealt with leprosy which is a visible plague.

Verse 2

AN ISSUE. The word <i>zav</i> (issue) is similar to the word <i>zavat</i> (flowing) in <i>flowing with milk</i> (Ex. 44:13). <i>Zav</i> refers to dripping drops.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets Ex. 44:13 as “dripping with milk.”</i>
OUT OF HIS FLESH. A euphemism for the male’s private part.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Flesh</i> is a euphemism for the penis.</i>
HIS ISSUE. <i>Zovo</i> (his issue) is a noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">With the pronominal suffix.</i>

Verse 3

AND THIS SHALL BE HIS UNCLEANLINESS. This means the issue takes two forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>His flesh will run with his issue or be stopped with his issue</i> (v. 3).</i>
HIS FLESH RUN WITH HIS ISSUE. The word <i>rar</i> (run) is related to the word <i>riro</i> (his spittle) in, <i>and let his spittle fall down upon his beard</i> (I Sam. 21:14).
OR BE STOPPED. The word <i>hechtim</i> means stopped. It is related to the word <i>chatum</i> (sealed) in <i>that is sealed</i> (Is. 29:11). It means that the issue pools and congeals so that semen is not ejaculated when the afflicted sleeps with a women. 

Verse 4

The same law applies to what the one who has an issue lies or sits on.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They have to be immersed in water and are unclean till the evening.</i> Similarly, there is one law regarding the one who touches what the afflicted lies on or sits on.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He has to immerse himself and his clothes and remains unclean until evening.</i>

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

ANDS HE THAT TOUCHETH THE FLESH OF HIM THAT HATH THE ISSUE. Any part without exception.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike earlier (v. 2 and v. 3) where the word <i>flesh</i> refers to the penis here it refers to any organ. Thus the meaning of <i>and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue</i> means, and he that touches any part of him that has the issue.</i>

Verse 8

SPIT. The meaning of <i>yarok</i> (spit) is known. It comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>resh, kof, kof</i>.</i> The fact that the <i>kof</i> of <i>rukki</i> (my spittle) (Job 7:19) has a <i>dagesh</i> is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>dagesh</i> compensates for the missing root <i>kof</i>.</i> Note, the spit of the one who suffers an issue is harmful,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is a source of uncleanliness.</i> for the issue is one of the infectious diseases. It is not the practice of men to spit in the face of other people.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And if</i> (<i>ve-khi</i>) <i>he that hath an issue spit upon him that is clean</i> could conceivably be rendered, and when (<i>ve-khi</i>) he that hath an issue spit upon him that is clean. “And when” implies that this is the normal course of events. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> What happened occurred unintentionally. The one suffering from an issue expectorated his spittle and it fell on a clean person.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-khi</i> is to be rendered as “and if” that is and if by accident.</i>

Verse 9

AND WHAT SADDLE. Which, as the transmitters of tradition explained, becomes unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rabbis the term <i>mercav</i> (saddle) refers to equipment set aside for riding. See <i>Torat Kohanim, Metzora</i> 3:9. Also see Rashi, “…The hold in front of the saddle…becomes unclean as a part of something for riding on (<i>mercav</i>)…and the saddle…is unclean as being something to sit upon (<i>moshav</i>)” (Rosenbaum and Silverman translation).</i>

Verse 10

ANY THING THAT IS UNDER HIM. Under the saddle shall become lightly unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It does not require immersion of garments (Weiser).</i> However, the uncleanliness of those who carry them<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The objects earlier mentioned, i.e., that which the one having an issue lies upon, sits upon, or rides upon.</i> is more strict.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It requires the immersion of garments.</i>

Verse 11

WITHOUT HAVING RINSED HIS HANDS IN WATER. It would have appeared to us<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">From a plain reading of the text.</i> that any food or anything similar, that the one having an issue touched by hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In others words, <i>toucheth</i> means touched by hand.</i> and the hands were washed, is not unclean, for the afflicted did not touch the place of the issue.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The hands most certainly did not have any issue on them, hence his hands do not defile. However, if the hands were not washed they may have come into contact with his issue, hence they defile.</i> However, since we saw that our fathers<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis of the Talmud.</i> explained that the hands are like the body<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rabbis the term hands in our verse does not only refer to the hands. It refers to the whole body. According tao the <i>Rabbis without having rinsed his hands with water</i> means without immersing his body. See <i>Niddah</i> 66b; <i>Kiddushin</i> 25a.</i> we accept their words. According to the plain meaning of our verse if the one experiencing an issue touches someone with hands that have been washed the one touched is unclean but his garments are not unclean. However, if the one suffering the issue did not wash his hands then the garments are unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>halakhah</i> there is no difference whether the one having an issue touched a person with hands that have or have not been washed.</i> This law is similar<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In that at times it entails a light uncleanliness and at times a strict uncleanliness.</i> to the one regarding he who touches anything which is under the saddle.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">One who touches that which is under the saddle becomes lightly unclean. However, one carries these objects becomes more strictly unclean. See I.E. on verse 10.</i>

Verse 14

The sacrifice consists of a burnt-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">To atone for evil thoughts. See I.E. on Lev. 1:4. The reference might be to thoughts of forbidden sexual practices. See next note.</i> and a sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">To atone for transgressions actually committed. According to Krinsky the reference is to prohibited sexual practices. The fact that Scripture goes on to speak of a man having an emission of semen might support this interpretation.</i> for the issue is a punishment for sin.

Verse 15



Verse 16

GO OUT. Involuntarily.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For verse 18 speaks of voluntary emission of semen.</i>
FLOW OF SEED. <i>Shikhvat</i> (flow) is similar to <i>shikhvat</i> (layer) in <i>the layer of dew</i> (Ex. 16:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Which I.E. renders a descent or a pouring down of dew. See I.E. on Ex. 16:14 (Vol. 2, p. 320).</i> It is related to the word <i>yashkiv</i> (pour out) in <i>who can pour out</i> (Job 38:37). 

Verse 17

It would appear to us<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">From the plain meaning of the text.</i> that the garment or the skin requires washing if it has wet semen or dry semen on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">If it come into contact with wet or dry semen, for the verse does not differentiate among them.</i> However, the truth lies with the words of tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah in <i>Niddah</i> 7:1 states, “Semen [coveys] uncleanliness when wet but not when dry.”</i>

Verse 23

The meaning of <i>And if he be on the bed</i> (v. 23) refers back to the object<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>And if he</i> (hu) <i>be on the bed</i> as, And if it be on the bed, for the word <i>hu</i> may mean he or it.</i> that she sits upon (v. 22).

Had the man had an evil intention when he had intercourse with the menstruating women then Scripture would have mentioned that he committed a major sin. Scripture appears to state, as a matter of fact, that a man who sleeps with a menstruating woman is unclean. One may take this to imply that one is permitted to sleep with a menstruating woman but is unclean if he does so.

Verse 31

THUS SHALL YE SEPARATE. Some say that <i>ve-hizzartem</i> (thus shall ye separate) is missing a <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>ve-hizzartem</i> comes from the root <i>zayin, heh, resh</i>.</i> and is to be interpreted <i>ve-hizzhartem</i> (and you shall warn). This cannot be so, for the <i>heh</i> is not vowel letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">A vowel letter is occasionally dropped, for it is not sounded.</i> It is only silent at the end of a word.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">It serves as a vowel letter at the end of the word. However, when it comes in the middle of a word it is sounded. Hence it is not dropped.</i> On the contrary, <i>ve-hizzartem</i> is related to the word <i>ve-yinnazeru</i> (that they separate)<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>nun, zayin, resh</i>.</i> in <i>that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</i> (Lev. 22:2). The meaning of that <i>ve-hizzartem</i> is, and you shall distance.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Or <i>thus shall ye separate</i>.</i> The word <i>nazir</i> (nazirite) is derived from the same root. A <i>nazir</i> is one who has distanced himself from the lusts of the world. <i>Ve-hizzartem</i> is vocalized like the word <i>ve-hippaltem</i> (and you shall divide)<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, peh, lamed</i>.</i> in, <i>and you shall divide the land</i> (Ezek. 45:1), for the <i>nun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>nuns of ve-hizzartem</i> and <i>ve-hippaltem</i>.</i> is swallowed in the <i>dagesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>zayin</i> of <i>ve-hizzartem</i> and the <i>peh of ve-hippaltem</i>.</i>

The veil separated the Holy of Holies and the rest of the tabernacle. Our chapter relates that after Aaron’s sons died, God told Moses to caution Aaron against entering the Holy of Holies so as not to die as his sons did. The implication of the latter is that Aaron’s sons died because they entered the Holy of Holies.</i>
[WHEN THEY DREW NEAR.] The word <i>be-korvatam</i> (when they drew near) is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">An infinitive with a pronoun suffixed to it.</i> Compare, <i>le-korvah</i> (to come unto) in <i>to come unto the work</i> (Ex. 36:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Korvatam</i> is made up of the infinitive <i>korvah</i> plus the pronominal suffix.</i> The <i>heh</i> in <i>le-korvah</i> has been turned into a <i>tav</i> in <i>be-korvatam</i> as is the practice with the feminine <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When a feminine word ending in a <i>heh</i> is connected to a pronominal suffix, the <i>heh</i> changes into a <i>tav</i>.</i> Rabbi Joshua,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A Karaite Bible commentator.</i> who says that <i>be-korvatam</i> is a noun following the paradigm of <i>chokhmatam</i> (their wisdom) (Jer. 49:7),<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That is; <i>korvatam</i> is made up of the noun <i>korvah</i> plus a pronominal suffix.</i> errs.

Verse 2

INTO THE HOLY PLACE. In contrast to the tent of meeting.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The tent of meeting is also a holy place. Hence I.E. points out that <i>the holy</i> here refers to the place that is considered holy with regard to the tent of meeting, i.e., it is holier than the tent of meeting.</i>
FOR I APPEAR IN THE CLOUD.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ki be-anan</i>, which I.E. renders: for only with a cloud.</i> It means Aaron shall only enter with incense. He shall produce smoke so that God’s glory will not be seen, and as a result he dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation renders <i>ki be-anan era’eh al ha-kapporet</i>,: for only with a cloud may I be seen over the ark-cover.</i> Note, the meaning of <i>ki be-anan era’eh</i> (for I appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover) is, I will not appear to him except through the agency of a cloud.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron is not permitted to look directly at God’s glory. He must screen God’s glory with the smoke of the incense. According to this interpretation <i>ki be-anan era’eh al ha-kapporet</i> means, I may only be seen through the smoke of the incense.</i> There are those who say that the meaning of <i>ki be-anan era’eh al ha-kapporet</i> (for I appear in the cloud) is, because I dwell in a cloud upon the ark-covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Aaron shall <i>come not at all times into the holy place</i> (v. 2).</i> <i>For I appear in the cloud</i> is similar in meaning to <i>The Lord hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness</i> (I Kings 8:12).

Verse 3

WITH A YOUNG BULLOCK. Its meaning is not that Aaron should bring the bullock into the holy place<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock</i> might be taken to mean that Aaron should bring the bullock into the Holy of Holies.

Others say also for the Levites,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The bullock also atones for the Levites.</i> for they found, <i>And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi</i> (Num. 17:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the Levites and the <i>kohanim</i> form one unit.</i> However, this is farfetched. On the contrary, the Levites are considered among the Israelites.

Scripture does not mention the ephod,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 28:6-12.</i> the breastplate,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 28:15-27.</i> and the robe of the ephod,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 28: 31-35.</i> for it earlier mentioned, <i>and the sound thereof</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The sound of the bells of the <i>ephod</i>.</i> <i>shall be heard when he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohen gadol</i>.</i> <i>goeth in unto the holy place</i> (Ex. 28:35).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The point is Ex. 28:35 tells us that the <i>kohen</i> must wear the robe when he enters the Holy of Holies. Now, the <i>ephod</i> and the breastplate were attached to the robe. Hence there was no need for Scripture to repeat once again that Aaron shall wear these garments when he enters the Holy of Holies. Rashbam on Ex. 28:35 explains similarly. It should be noted that this interpretation is contrary to the accepted <i>halakhic</i> opinion which rules that the <i>kohen gadol</i> does not enter the Holy of Holies wearing the <i>ephod</i>, its band, the breastplate, and the robe. See <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 26a. Also see Rashi, “This teaches us that he must not officiate in the interior (the Holy of Holies) robed in the eight garments which were the insignia of the High Priest…in which he performed the service outside…but in the four garments…like an ordinary priest” (Rosenbaum and Silbermann).</i> The men of the second temple who served without the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Thummim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Which was placed in the breastplate (Ex. 28:30).</i> learned from this verse [that their practice was proper].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture does not mention the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Thummim</i> in our verse, it appears that the wearing of the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Thummim</i> is not essential for the service to be valid.</i> There were also prophets there.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">At the beginning of the second temple period. These prophets taught the Israelites that the <i>kohen gadol</i> may officiate without the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Thumim</i> if the latter are not available.</i>

Verse 8

LOTS. We know what they are from the words of our sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yoma</i> 36a.</i> The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> says that Azazel is the name of a mountain. It is so called because of its might.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hard and rocky. See <i>Yoma</i> 63a. Azazel is a combination of <i>az</i> (strong) and <i>el</i> (tall). Azazel thus means mighty and tall mountain (Krinsky).</i> God’s name<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The divine name El. El means mighty.</i> is mentioned in Azazel as it is in <i>ke-harere el</i> (the mighty mountains) (Ps. 36:7) and in <i>yakti’el</i> (Joktheel) (II Kings 14:7). The Gaon, the Levite,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Neither I.E. nor any of the commentaries identify him.</i> caught him in error. He pointed out that the <i>alef</i> of Azazel is placed between one <i>zayin</i> and the other <i>zayin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The word Azazel in Hebrew does not have the word <i>alef lamed</i> in it, for the word is spelled <i>ayin, zayin, alef, zayin lamed</i>.</i> There are those who say that Azazel is the name of a mountain close to Mount Sinai. God commanded that the goat be led and brought up there until it slipped down the mountain. Later on in the time of the temple, they led it to a different mountain. “And Aaron did” (v. 34) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>and he did</i>. I.E.’s point is that Scripture goes out of the way to state that Aaron did as God commanded him in the wilderness, for later on when Israel entered Israel some parts of the Yom Kippur ritual were performed a bit differently. The sending of the goat to Mount Azazel is an example.</i> The same, in my opinion, as I will explain in its place,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 23:11.</i> is true of the festival of Shavu’ot.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., God commanded Israel to observe the first Shavu’ot on a Sunday. However, the latter did not apply in succeeding years. See I.E. on Lev. 23:11.</i> There are those who say that the service<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Yom Kippur service.</i> during the second temple was unlike that of the first, for the <i>kohen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The high priest.</i> lacked the garments<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The priestly garments, <i>viz</i>., the ephod, its band, the breastplate, and the robe.</i> and there was no ark-cover. This commentator says that the goat was sent into the wilderness, for Scripture states, <i>and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness</i> (v. 22).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the goat was sent into the desert unaccompanied.</i> The latter is similar in meaning to the bird of the one who is cleansed from leprosy<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 14:1-7. This bird was sent unaccompanied. According to the rabbis of the Talmud the goat was accompanied by a person set aside for this purpose. This commentator believes that this was not the case in the desert, for the ritual in the second temple period was not exactly the same as the one described in our chapter.</i> which is sent into the open field, an uninhabited place. <i>A land which is cut off</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture’s description of the place where the goat is sent.</i> (v. 22) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">That the goat is sent into a wilderness.</i> We answered him that they sent the goat into the wilderness as it is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 22.</i> However, the goat was pursued<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">By a person set aside for this purpose (v. 21), literally, he pursued.</i> until it fled and climbed up a rock. The rabbis therefore said, “and he<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The man who pursues it.</i> pushes it down.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 67a. The point is that since a person accompanied the goat it was possible for him to push the goat off the mountain.</i> Rabbi Samuel<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni Ha-Gaon.</i> says that even though it is written that the goat offered as a sin offering is to be offered to God, the goat that was sent was also offered to God. There is no need for this interpretation, for the goat sent into the wilderness did not serve as an offering since it was not slaughtered. If you are able to understand the secret that follows Azazel<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10 reads, <i>la-azazel ha-midbarah</i> (for Azazel into the wilderness). According to I.E. the word <i>ha-midbarah</i> is the key to understanding the meaning of Azazel.</i> then you will know its secret and the secret of its name, for it has comrades in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., Azazel is a compound word. It is made up of the two words <i>ez</i> (goat) and <i>azal</i> (to go). There are many such compound names in Scripture. Compare, Emmanuel (God is with us). According to I. E. the meaning of <i>la-azazel ha-midbarah</i> is, for a goat that goes into the wilderness.</i> I will reveal a bit of its secret to you in a hint. When you are thirty-three, you will understand it.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According Nahmanides what Ibn Ezra means is, if you count 33 verses you will understand why the goat was sent into the wilderness. If we count 33 verses we come to Lev. 17:7. The Torah there prohibits Israel from sacrificing to the <i>se’irim</i> (satyrs). According to I.E. the <i>se’irim</i> were demons that had the shape of goats. Now it is not clear what the purpose was of sending the goat to demons who were shaped like goats. According to Nahmanides the goat was a gift to Satan so that he would not interfere with Israel’s sacrifice. However, it is doubtful that I.E. had this in mind. Weiser suggests that the goat was sent to a place of demons so that the sins which it (literally or symbolically) bore would not contaminate people, for demons dwell in a place which is uninhabited.</i>

Verse 10

SHALL BE SET ALIVE. The word <i>yo’omad</i> (shall be set) is a <i>hofal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, from the heavy conjugation which has a word added to it and whose subject is not mentioned.</i> The <i>yod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Prefixed to the root.</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>shuruk</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kubbutz</i>, for that is the way words in the imperfect are conjugated in the <i>hofal</i>.

Verse 11

AND AARON SHALL PRESENT. Scripture goes on to explain that after Aaron has presented the bullock and the two goats to the tent of meeting, he shall begin to slaughter his bullock.

Verse 13



Verse 14

It would have appeared to us that <i>upon the ark-cover</i> (v. 14); <i>and before the arkcover</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) are to be taken literally. However, the transmitters of tradition said that <i>upon the ark-cover</i> means between the staves.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud the <i>kohen</i> stands between the staves of the ark and sprinkles from there. Furthermore, according to the rabbis the <i>kohen</i> does not actually sprinkle blood on the ark-cover but upward towards the ark-cover.

AND IT SHALL BE A STATUTE FOR EVER UNTO YOU. This service.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">This service shall be <i>a statute forever unto you</i>.</i>
IN THE SEVENTH MONTH, ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH, YE SHALL AFFLICT YOUR SOULS. Since Scripture writes, <i>And let your soul delight itself in fatness</i> (Is. 55:2), we know that affliction is the reverse of delight and that affliction of the soul refers to fasting.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">When a person eats, the soul is said to “delight itself.” Thus when Scripture speaks of the soul being afflicted it means the reverse; i.e., the reference is to a fast.</i> Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>And satisfy the afflicted soul</i> (Is. 58:10), the meaning of which is like <i>And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.), for it is the style of the prophets to repeat themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The hungry</i> is another way of saying <i>the afflicted soul</i>. We thus see that affliction of the soul refers to a lack of food. Hence it refers to fasting.</i> Now since we have tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">That affliction of the soul refers to fasting.</i> there is no reason to go on searching.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">For proof that our verse speaks of fasting.</i> <i>I afflicted my soul with fasting</i> (Ps. 35:13) is no proof<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">That afflicting the soul means fasting, for one may argue that since Scripture goes on to explain that the psalmist afflicted his soul by fasting, in cases where the “affliction of the soul” is not qualified, the reference is not to fasting.</i> because the word fast is mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse.</i> The general rule is, whenever we find in Scripture the word affliction connected to soul, the reference is to a fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever the Torah speaks of the affliction of the soul the reference is to fasting.</i>
THE HOME-BORN, OR THE STRANGER THAT SOJOURNETH AMONG YOU. We are not permitted to let him<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The stranger.</i> do any work,<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">On Yom Kippur.</i> but we do not force him<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>nachrichennu</i> as in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 instead of <i>nachritennu</i> (we shall cut him off).</i> to fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture does not mention the stranger when it speaks of fasting. It only mentions the stranger when it speaks of not doing work on Yom Kippur.</i>

Verse 30

SHALL ATONEMENT BE MADE FOR YOU. By the <i>kohen</i>. The commentators therefore say regarding the goat which is sent into the wilderness, concerning which it is written, <i>shall be set alive…to make atonement over him</i> (v. 10), that the atonement becomes effective by the placing of the goat before the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, atonement is not affected by driving the goat into the wilderness, for the latter is not done by the <i>kohen gadol</i>.</i>
FROM ALL YOUR SINS. This is to be understood in accordance with my earlier explanation that the noun <i>chattat</i> (sin) is a general term. It is therefore found with reference to both accidental and deliberate sin.

Verse 31

IT IS A SABBATH OF SOLEMN REST. Some say that <i>shabbat shabbaton</i> (a sabbath of solemn rest) means rest for the soul and rest for the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">For the word <i>shabbat</i> is repeated in the phrase.</i> Others say that <i>shabbat shabbaton</i> means a rest above which there is no other rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">It means a total rest.</i> Both words<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">In the phrase.</i> are nouns. At times the other word comes first.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads: <i>shabbat shabbaton</i>. However, Ex. 16:23 reads <i>shabbaton shabbat</i>.</i> They have one meaning,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> and <i>shabbaton</i> have one meaning.</i> This interpretation is not farfetched.
IT IS A STATUTE FOR EVER. To fast.

Verse 32

AND THE PRIEST…SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT. Scripture now goes on to explain what the <i>kohen</i> shall make atonement for.
WHO SHALL BE ANOINTED. By the anointer<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads: And the priest who shall anoint him (<i>yimshach oto</i>) and who shall be consecrated…shall make atonement. Now the priest who anoints the <i>kohen gadol</i> does not make atonement. Neither is the priest who anoints consecrated to wear the high priestly vestments. Furthermore, the text omits with what the anointed shall do the anointing. Hence I.E. points out that <i>yimshach oto</i> is short for <i>yimshach ha-moshech oto</i>, which means whom the anointer shall anoint. Thus according to I.E. the first part of our verse should be rendered: And the priest whom the anointer shall anoint with the anointing oil.</i> with the anointing oil<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not say with what the <i>kohen gadol</i> was anointed. Hence I.E. points out that <i>asher yimshach oto</i> is short for <i>yimshach oto be-shemen ha-mishchah</i>.</i> after he has been consecrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>and who shall be consecrated</i>.</i>
AND HE SHALL PUT ON. He<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohen gadol</i>.</i> is the one who shall put on these holy garments, for another person may not wear them.

Verse 33

THE MOST HOLY PLACE. Which is located on the inner side of the veil.
AND SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THE PRIESTS AND FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE ASSEMBLY. The Levites are included among the latter, for the Levites are not called <i>kohanim</i>. On the contrary, every <i>kohen</i> is a Levite<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">For he is a member of the tribe of Levi.</i> but every Levite is not a <i>kohen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Only those descended from Aaron are <i>kohanim</i>.</i>

Verse 34

AND THIS SHALL BE…UNTO YOU. Scripture already stated this.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 29.</i> It is repeated to add <i>once in the year</i>.
AND HE DID. And Aaron did.

Chapter 17



Verse 1



Verse 2

SPEAK UNTO AARON, AND UNTO HIS SONS. For they are the ones who slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The sacrifices.</i> for Israel. 

Verse 3

If the Torah had read, <i>in the camp</i> (v. 3),<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That is, if verse 3 had only stated, <i>in the camp</i>.</i> then it would have been permissible to slaughter it<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Any one of the animals mentioned in our verse.</i> outside the camp.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hence verse 3 reads, <i>in the camp, or…without the camp</i>.</i> Also, this<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The law codified in verses 3 and 4.</i> commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Like many others which precede it.</i> is dependent upon the Holy Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">It is in effect only when a central sanctuary for the bringing of sacrifices exists.</i> However, this law applies only to any place that is close to Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Even when the temple stood, the law applied only to places which were close to Jerusalem. I.E. is interpreting according to the plain meaning of the text. According to the rabbis, our verse speaks of sacrifices; i.e., sacrifices are not to be offered in any place except for the tabernacle or the temple. See <i>Sifra</i> and Rashi.</i> We know how close from the words of tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kiddishin</i> 57b.</i> for if the place is far, one is permitted to slaughter flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He is permitted to slaughter an animal for the purpose of eating its flesh without presenting it for an offering.</i> The latter is so, for Scripture states it.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 12:21.</i> Many say that it is forbidden to eat flesh in the exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This was a Karaite opinion.</i> They explain <i>neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth</i> (Dan. 10:3)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel, who lived in Babylon, tells us that he refrained from meat and wine while he fasted. This indicates that he ate meat when he did not fast.</i> as referring to the flesh of fish.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites explain the word “flesh” in <i>neither came flesh…in my mouth</i> as referring to the flesh of fish, for they maintain that one cannot eat meat outside of the Land of Israel.</i> They did not speak correctly. I do not want to dwell on this and answer them.

Verse 4



Verse 5

TO THE END THAT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MAY BRING. This is the reason for this commandment. <i>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</i> (v. 7) explains <i>in the open field</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The reason Israel shall not sacrifice in the open field is so that <i>they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</i> whom they believe to dwell there.</i>

Verse 6



Verse 7

UNTO THE SATYRS. <i>Se’irim</i> (satyrs) are the demons. They are so called because the body of one who sees them “storms.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The person who sees them is agitated. This opinion connects <i>se’irim</i>, spelled with a <i>sin</i>, to the word <i>sa’arah</i> (storm), spelled with a <i>samekh</i>.</i> However, it appears that they are so called because the insane see them in the form of goats (<i>se’irim</i>). The word “more” teaches that the Israelites did so in Egypt.
AFTER WHOM THEY GO ASTRAY. For whoever seeks after them and believes in them strays from under his God, for he thinks that there is someone aside from God the glorious and awe inspiring who does good or bad. This section<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Which prohibits the slaughter of meat except as an offering.</i> does not mention the stranger, for the commandment regarding sacrifices and burnt offerings falls on Israel. Scripture mentions the stranger<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 8, which prohibits offering a sacrifice outside of the sanctuary.</i> in order to teach that Israel shall not permit a stranger to sacrifice to idols in the Land of Israel. The law regarding <i>all manner of blood</i> (v. 10) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It is the same case with the law regarding the prohibition of eating all manner of blood.</i> The eating of blood is prohibited<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">To the Israelite and to the stranger.</i> because it is the very life, for the flesh lives by the blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The blood is offered on the altar to atone for the life of the sinner, life for life. It is therefore not to be eaten.</i> The truth of the matter is that the life by which a person lives is in the blood which is in the heart.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

THAT MAKETH ATONEMENT BY REASON OF THE LIFE.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ba-nefesh yekhapper</i>.</i> The blood makes atonement by the life which is in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation renders <i>ba-nefesh yekhapper</i> (makes atonement by reason of the life) as makes atonement with the life which is in it.</i> The reason for the latter is life for life.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The life of the animal is given in place of the life of the sinner.</i> There are others who explain <i>ba-nefesh yekhapper</i> (that maketh atonement by reason of the life) as, to make atonement for your souls.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">They render <i>ba-nefesh</i> (by reason of the life) as for the soul, the reference being for the soul of the sinner.</i> However, the latter makes no sense, for what reason is there for Scripture to say this after stating <i>to make atonement for your souls</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">What reason is there for Scripture to repeat itself?</i>

Verse 12



Verse 13

THAT TAKETH IN HUNTING ANY BEAST OR FOWL THAT MAY BE EATEN. Such as a deer or a gazelle.
OR FOWL THAT MAY BE EATEN. We also learn from this verse that we should not allow the stranger to eat in our land the flesh of a pig or a horse, or any bird of prey which is unclean. It is possible that God commanded that all blood which is not offered on the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>the blood of any beast</i> (chayyah) <i>or fowl that may be eaten</i>.</i> be covered so that the one who sees the blood of the deer, stag, or fowl not think that it comes from a sacrifice that was offered to an idol, for God had commanded that no blood be eaten and that no blood from God’s altar be spilled outside of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Hence a person who sees blood pooled on the ground will assume that it is from blood offered to idols.</i> I will explain the secret of this verse in the Torah portion opening with the words <i>Behold, I set</i> (Deut. 11:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 12:25. I.E. there explains that eating the blood of an animal will harm one’s soul as well as have a bad effect on one’s children.</i>

Verse 14

THE BLOOD THEREOF IS ALL ONE WITH THE LIFE THEREOF. The blood is coupled with the life thereof,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>damo be-nafsho</i> as the blood thereof is with the life thereof.</i> for it is known<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">That was the belief of physicians in I.E.’s time.</i> that the threads<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">What we call arteries and veins.</i> that go out from the left side of the heart are divided, half for blood and half for the breath, like the olive oil and the light thereof.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Breath and life are tied to the blood in the same way that light is coupled to oil. Blood maintains one’s breath and life.</i>
THEREFORE I SAID UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The meaning of <i>va-omar</i> (therefore I said) is, and I have previously said.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 10.</i> The reference is to the section now mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This very section.</i> 

Verse 15

Since Scripture mentions the beast (<i>chayyah</i>) which is not offered as a sacrifice, and similarly the fowl,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 13.</i> it goes on to speak of <i>every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself</i> (v. 15), which is also not offered as a sacrifice. Scripture also mentions the latter because of its reference to an animal which is taken in hunting.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 13. Animals taken in hunting are very likely to fall into the category of <i>nevelah</i> (dying of itself) or <i>terefah</i> (tom), for they are taken by bow and arrow or traps.</i> If one does so deliberately<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">If he deliberately eats of an animal <i>which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts</i>.</i> he violates a negative precept<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 22:30; Deut. 14:21.</i> and is flogged.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15 tells us that one who <i>eateth that which dieth of itself</i> also is unclean. Hence I.E. points out that he is not only unclean but he violates the law which prohibits the eating of an animal that dies of itself or is torn.</i> If he does so accidentally, he brings a sin offering. If one should argue,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">With I.E.’s earlier statement that verse 13 teaches that Israel is not permitted to allow the stranger to eat the flesh of a pig or a horse in the Land of Israel.</i> does not Scripture state, <i>thou mayest give it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The flesh of an animal that dies of itself and, by extension, the flesh of all prohibited animals.</i> <i>unto the stranger that is within thy gates, that he may eat it</i> (Deut. 14:21)? The answer is that this<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> speaks of a stranger who dwells in the Land of Israel. Scripture similarly reads, <i>or the stranger that sojourneth among you</i> (Lev. 16:29). We shall not allow him to eat anything that dies of itself. However, we may give it<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Forbidden meat.</i> to the stranger that comes into our gates<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The stranger who does not live in the Land of Israel but visits it. This is what Deut. 14:21 deals with.</i> and he will eat it outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Outside the city gates.</i>

Verse 16

THEN HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY. Permanently. He<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Filwarg emends to or. In this case I.E. reads: Permanently. Or he will be forgiven for his sin by the punishment which God shall bring upon him.</i> will be forgiven for his sin by the punishment which God shall bring upon him. This section<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 18, which opens with <i>After the doings of the land of Egypt…shall ye not do</i> (v. 13).</i> follows because Scripture mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 7.</i> the topic of the satyrs which Israel sacrificed to in Egypt. The prohibited sexual practices<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in chapter 18.</i> deal with those of the land of Canaan,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">While <i>the doings of the land of Egypt</i> refers to offering to the satyrs.</i> for Scripture so states at the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In Lev. 18:27.</i>

Chapter 18



Verse 1



Verse 2

[I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD.] The meaning of this verse is, on this condition<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Keeping God’s ordinances (v. 4).</i> I will be your God.

Verse 3

NEITHER SHALL YE WALK IN THEIR STATUTES.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>chukkotehem</i>.</i> A person should not habituate himself to walk in this way<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The way of the Canaanites. I.E. interprets statutes as referring to the practices of the Canaanites because verses 27 and 28 make it clear that the practices enumerated in our chapter refer to Canaanite mores.</i> to the point where it becomes a statute for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It becomes his second nature.</i> 
However, <i>after the doings of the land of Egypt</i> refers to their ordinances.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Their laws.</i> <i>Mine ordinances</i> (mishpatai)<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Not those of the Egyptians.</i> <i>shall ye do</i> (v. 4) is proof of this. The latter refers to the ordinances recorded in the Book of the Covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 24:7. The Book of the Covenant was given to Israel three months after the Exodus.</i> which is set forth in the Torah portion that opens with <i>Now these are the ordinances</i> (mishpatim) (Ex. 21:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets our verse as follows: Do not follow the laws of Egypt where you lived, nor the practices of the land of Canaan where I will bring you.</i>

Verse 4

I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. I will then be your God.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If you do not follow the laws of Egypt, nor the practices of the land of Canaan.</i> 

Verse 5

The reason Scripture states, <i>Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances</i> (v. 5) is to make it clear that they are a source of life in both worlds<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This world and the world to come.</i> to those who observe them. God will give eternal life to the person who understands their secret. He will never die.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">His soul shall live on after the death of the body.</i> Scripture, as I have explained, therefore reads, <i>I am the Lord your God</i>.

Verse 6

NONE OF YOU. <i>Ish ish</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, man, man.</i> (none of you) means each and every man. Since Scripture does not mention the house of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> we learn that we are not permitted to allow the stranger to practice in our country any of the abominations mentioned, so that he does not defile the land.
ANY THAT IS NEAR OF KIN TO HIM. <i>She’er</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, flesh, that is, one’s flesh, i.e., one’s near relative.</i> (near) is a general term for all those with whom one is prohibited to engage in sexual relations. Scripture then goes into detail.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">And lists the people with whom one may not have sexual intercourse.</i> Rabbi Aaron Ha-Kohen<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A Gaon in Pumpaditha, author of a commentary on the Torah. Rabbi Hai Gaon was his student.</i> says that the reference is to the emission of semen in vain.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Aaron Ha-Kohen our verse does not speak of sexual intercourse but deals with approaching a near relative and uncovering her nakedness for the purpose of obtaining sexual pleasure (ejaculation).</i>
NONE OF YOU SHALL APPROACH. Approach is a euphemism for lying with.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Engaging in sexual intercourse.</i> Similarly <i>And I approached the prophetess</i> (Is. 8:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, I had intercourse with the prophetess.</i> Our verse is close to <i>come not near a woman</i> (Ex. 19:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, do not have intercourse with a woman.</i>
NAKEDNESS. <i>Ervah</i> (nakedness) refers to something unseemly which is exposed and has to be covered. 
The meaning of <i>I am the Lord</i> is that God loves the one who separates himself to serve God and to obey his word. What happened at Mount Sinai is proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Before the revelation Israel had to separate themselves from sexual relations and sanctify themselves. See Ex. 19:15.</i> The first man is proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., Adam experienced sexual desire only after eating from the tree of knowledge. See I.E. on Gen. 3:6 (Vol. 1, p. 67). He was expelled from the presence of the Lord because of his lust.</i> This is the secret of man.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Man is to separate himself from the pleasures of this world and serve God. See the introduction to Vol. 4. Also, see <i>Yesod Mora</i> 10; 12.</i> Since the inclination of the heart of man is like that of beasts, it was not possible to prohibit all women.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Since people have sexual desire, the Torah did not prohibit it. It limited it.</i> Note, Scripture prohibited all women that are found around a person at all times.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">If Scripture had permitted close relatives, then a person would indulge in sexual intercourse at all times.</i> I will reveal to you a hidden and sealed secret in the Torah portion <i>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies</i> (Deut. 23:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 23:10. So too Maimonides, <i>Guide</i> 3:64, “The female relatives whom a man may not marry…as a rule…(being) constantly together with him in his house; they would easily listen to him, and do what he desires; they are near at hand, and he would have no difficulty in procuring them” (Friedlander translation, p. 376).</i> Observe, whoever defiles himself is distanced from God, from receiving God.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">God can only be received when a person is in a state of purity. God turns away from those who are defiled. See Deut. 23:15.</i> Scripture therefore mentions, <i>I am the Lord</i>.

Verse 7

THE NAKEDNESS OF THY FATHER. Scripture begins<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The list of those with whom one is not permitted to engage in sexual intercourse.</i> with the father, who precedes the son.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture begins the list of those with whom one is not allowed to engage in sexual intercourse with those related to one’s closest male relative.</i> Scripture states that anyone who is closely related to his father or mother<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, of the nakedness of the father or the nakedness of the mother.</i> is prohibited. Note, the nakedness of the mother is the one that is mentioned first.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For she is the most closely related female.</i> The nakedness of the father’s wife, who is not the mother, follows. Then comes the sister, who is the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.

Verse 8



Verse 9

BORN AT HOME. Who was born in accordance with the laws of the house of Israel following the first and second stage of marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A Jewish marriage is effectuated in two stages, <i>erusin</i> and <i>nusu’in</i>. During the first stage the bride still lives with her parents. In the second step she moves into her husbands house. Today the two stages are combined.</i>
BORN ABROAD. Unconventionally.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Out of wedlock.</i> Some say that <i>born at home</i> is similar to <i>were born upon Joseph’s knees</i> (Gen. 50:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>were brought up on Joseph’s knees</i> means were brought up in Joseph’s house.</i> It means she grew up with you in the same house. It is possible that <i>born abroad</i> means she is in a different place and a different city and grew up away from you, outside of your father’s house. Scripture next mentions <i>thy son’s daughter</i> (v. 10).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">After mentioning those closest to one’s father, his wives, and his daughters, it mentions those close to one’s son.</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11

THE NAKEDNESS OF THY FATHER’S WIFE’S DAUGHTER. There are those who say that this refers to a sister from a father and mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">While verse 9 speaks of a sister from one’s father or one’s mother. Hence our verse is not redundant.</i> We know<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">From this verse; i.e., we learn from this verse.</i> that the one who sleeps with a sister from a father and mother violates two negative laws.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">He transgresses the law prohibiting intercourse with the daughter of one’s father (v. 9) and the law forbidding intercourse with the daughter of the wife of one’s father.</i> There are those who say that our verse was written for emphasis.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It repeats what is written in verse 9 to emphasize that one is not to sleep with one’s sister.</i> The Sadducees<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that <i>thy father’s wife’s daughter</i> does not refer to the daughter of one’s mother. They explain that <i>begotten of thy father</i> means whom your father raised. Our verse deals with an instance in which the father took a woman who had a small daughter. They say the same thing regarding Tamar.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Tamar was the daughter of David. She was raped by her brother Amnon. See II Sam. 13:1-22. According to the Karaites, Tamar was not actually David’s daughter. She was his stepdaughter. When David married her mother she was already grown. According to the Karaites, Scripture only prohibits a stepsister that grew up in one’s home. Hence it was permitted for Amnon to take her in marriage,</i> Their proof is, <i>for he will not withhold me from thee</i> (II Sam. 13:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">If she were his real sister, she would not have said this to Amnon.</i> She thus was not begotten by David. Now since the transmitters of tradition said that the daughter of your father’s wife is permitted, we have no need to answer those who invent things in their hearts. It is possible that “the daughter of thy father’s wife” refers to a daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Of one’s father.</i> resulting from a rape.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">While verse 9 speak of a sister born in wedlock. Hence our verse is not redundant.</i> 

Verse 12

The word <i>she’er</i> (kin<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, flesh.</i>) and <i>basar</i> (kin)<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, flesh.</i> are close in meaning.

Verse 13



Verse 14

SHE IS THINE AUNT. She is considered as your aunt.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For she is the wife of your uncle.</i> Similarly “Behold Hanamel, my uncle.”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">There is no such verse. The reference appears to be to Jer. 32:7, <i>Behold Hanamel, the son of Shallum thine uncle. Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads: <i>in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle</i> (Jer. 32:6). Be that as it may, I.E.’s point is that Hanamel was not Jeremiah’s uncle. He was the son of Jeremiah’s uncle. Nevertheless, Scripture refers to him as his uncle.</i> Now what will those who rely on the Torah alone for the commandments<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> do? For Scripture does not prohibit the wife of the brother of one’s mother, and not the mother of one’s father, or the mother of one’s mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">They are prohibited by Rabbinic dictate. However, the Karaites, who do not accept Rabbinic tradition, have no basis for prohibiting these women.</i> We therefore need tradition. It is possible that the reason that Scripture did not mention that the wife of one’s mother’s brother is prohibited is that we learn this from the prohibition of the wife of the father’s brother. The prohibition of the wife of one’s brother is mentioned in the Torah (Lev. 19:3) portion <i>Ye shall be holy</i>. Also, the reason that those whom I mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The mother of one’s father and the mother of one’s mother.</i> are not listed in Scripture is that the Torah speaks of that which is prevalent.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Sexual intercourse with grandparents is extremely rare.</i>

Verse 15



Verse 16

THOU SHALT NOT UNCOVER THE NAKEDNESS OF THY BROTHER’S WIFE. This is explained in the Torah portion <i>If brethren dwell together</i> (Deut. 25:5). 
To the one who asks why didn’t Scripture mention a daughter, [I reply] that the daughter is stated in <i>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter</i> (Lev. 18:17), whether or not it is his daughter, for once he has slept with the mother the daughter is prohibited.

Verse 17

THEY ARE NEAR KINSWOMEN. <i>She’er</i> (kin) and <i>sha’arah</i> (kinswomen) are two nouns. If the <i>alef</i> of <i>sha’arah</i> were not a guttural, it would be quiescent like the <i>lamed</i> of <i>salmah</i> (raiment) (Ex. 22:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is, if the <i>alef</i> of <i>sha’arah</i> were not a guttural, it would have been vocalized with a <i>sheva na</i>, rather than with a <i>chataf pattach</i>.</i>

Verse 18

TO BE A RIVAL. <i>Li-tzeror</i> (to be a rival) is related to the word <i>tzaratah</i> (her rival) in <i>And her rival vexed her</i> (I Sam. 1:6). Note, Scripture does not mention in the Torah portion <i>Ye shall be holy</i> (Lev. 19:2)<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah portion <i>Ye shall be holy</i> lists those with whom one is not permitted to have sexual intercourse and the punishment for violating these prohibitions.</i> the punishment for sleeping with two sisters, and it does not mention the punishment for sleeping with the daughter of one’s son and with the daughter of one’s daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. notes this. However, he does not explain why.</i> The one who says that Rachel and Leah<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Two sisters whom Jacob married.</i> were not sisters<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Jacob was permitted to marry them.</i> errs. His proof is, <i>for all these abominations…</i> (Lev. 18:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Marrying two sisters is thus an abomination. Jacob would not commit an abominable act.</i> However, this is not a rigorous proof. There are those who answer the one who asks, how could God punish for something He did not warn against,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 27 and 28 tells us that the Canaanites were punished for practicing the sexual acts that the Torah prohibits. Hence the question arose from the anonymous commentator quoted by I.E.</i> by saying the sons of Noah were warned about these sexual offenses. Others say<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In reply to the problem raised by Jacob marrying two sisters.</i> that even though Scripture makes a general statement, <i>for all these abominations…</i>, the reference is not to all these abominations but to most of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase does not include two sisters. Thus marrying two sisters is not an abomination. The law prohibiting two sisters did not apply to Jacob, who lived before the Torah was given to Israel.</i> You will learn my opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding why Jacob was permitted to marry two sisters.</i> in the Torah portion <i>And Moses went</i> (Deut. 31:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 31:16 and the notes thereto (Vol. 4, p. 227).</i> 

Verse 19

One who sleeps with a menstruating woman is considered to have slept with a woman whose nakedness one is prohibited from uncovering.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the prohibition to have intercourse with her is limited to the time of her menses and the child born from such an act is not considered a <i>mamzer</i> (illegitimate).</i>

Verse 20

WITH THY NEIGHBOR’S WIFE. This excludes the captive woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 21:10-14.</i> There are those who say that she<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse does not deal with a non-Jewish woman, for a non-Jewish woman is prohibited to an Israelite whether she is married or not. However, a Jewish woman is prohibited to an Israelite only if she is married.

For other interpretations see Rabbi Samuel Zarza, Krinsky, and Weiser.</i> was previously prohibited. Those whose sexual craving<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, lust of their inclination.</i> overcame the intelligence of their heart erred in explaining the meaning of <i>le-zara</i><sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to give seed.</i> (carnally).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">These commentators read our verse as follows: You shall not lie with your neighbor’s wife for the purpose of seed that is to impregnate her.</i> We know that sexual intercourse is divided into three groups. One, to be fruitful and multiply<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">For reproduction.</i> and not to satisfy lust. Two, to relieve the fullness of the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">For release of sexual tension. So too Maimonides, <i>M.T. Hilkhot De’ot</i> 3:2, “He will…not engage in sexual intercourse whenever he lusts, but only when he knows that he has to ejaculate for reasons of health.”</i> Three, for the purpose of lust, which is similar to the lust of an animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">For pure sexual pleasure.</i> Now since Scripture says <i>le-zara</i> (carnally), the meaning of which is even for seed,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders our verse: You shall not lie with your neighbor’s wife even for the purpose of producing seed (children), that is, to impregnate her.</i> a married woman is prohibited by a very severe prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">For a married woman is prohibited even if the adultery is not committed for the purpose of sexual lust.</i> <i>And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech</i> (v. 21) is proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>le-zara</i> (for seed) means for the purpose of children, for the word seed in verse 21 definitely applies to children.</i> Scripture adds to <i>defile thyself with her</i> to let us know that the one who touches her will not be cleansed; he will be defiled forever. This verse<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> does not at all prohibit a non-Jewish woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation verse 21 prohibits intercourse with a non-Jewish woman, who will offer her children to Molech (Weiser). See I.E. on Lev. 21:2. Other non-Jewish women are not included in this verse. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads: This verse (verse 21) prohibits all non-Jewish women.</i> There is no argument from the captive woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">That one may marry non-Jewish women, for the captive woman is not Jewish and yet an Israelite may marry her.</i> for she converts to Judaism.

Verse 21

TO MOLECH. Molech is the name of an image. The rabbis interpreted Molech as a general term for all<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Any idol.</i> whom a person accepts as a king over him.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">For the word Molech is connected to the word <i>melekh</i> (king).</i> It is possible that Molech is the abomination of the Ammonites.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">God of the Ammonites.</i> 
The word <i>le-ha’avir</i> (to set apart) is to burn, for that was the way Molech was worshipped. Some say that they used to pass<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>le-ha’avir</i> (to set apart) literally means to pass over.</i> their sons over the fire. Some lived and some died. In view of the fact that the verse does not mention fire, some explained <i>le-ha’avir lamolekh</i> (to set apart to Molech) as meaning to cause to pass over from the Torah of God to another religion.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads: You shall not give any of your seed to cause them to pass over to Molech.</i> You will defile the Lord who is known as your God<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the Lord who is called over you that He is your God.</i> when you give from the holy seed to Molech. The Gaon says that fornication has eight levels.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 20:13 (Vol. 2, p. 430).</i> The most severe is intercourse with a beast of another species; afterwards comes the male, the entire gender of which is prohibited; afterwards comes the nakedness of the father’s wife and her companions,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Other women who are similarly prohibited.</i> which are prohibited at all times. I will not dwell on this, for what purpose is there to these words since Scripture says, concerning all of them, <i>even the souls that do them shall be cut off</i> (v. 29).

Verse 22

WITH MANKIND. Since we find, <i>Behold, I lay yester-night with my father</i> (Gen. 19:34), we see that the prohibition<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thou shalt not lie</i>.</i> applies to the one who lay and the one who is lain with.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">For Lot’s daughter was lain with and yet she said, <i>Behold, I lay yesternight with my father</i>.</i> Rabbi Hannanel, of blessed memory, says that there are those in whose body a female genitalia is newly formed.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Hannanel our verse speaks of anal intercourse and vaginal intercourse with a man who has an artificial vagina.</i> However, this is impossible according to the laws of nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture would not prohibit something which does not normally exist.</i> There are those who say that the reference is to an androgynous person. All this pain was caused by the fact that Scripture employs the plural <i>mishkeve ishah</i> (as with womankind).<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>mishkeve ishah</i> is “intercourses of a woman.” Intercourses is plural. It implies more than one type of intercourse, i.e., anal and vaginal intercourse.</i> There is an individual opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmud. See <i>San</i>. 55a.</i> that <i>mishkeve ishah</i> refers to two types of intercourse.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Vaginal and anal. This interpretation explains our verse as follows: You shall not sleep with a man by employing one of the two types of intercourse that one employs when having intercourse with a woman. In other words, do not engage in anal intercourse with a male.</i> I believe that the precept is to be taken literally.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The reference in our verse is to anal intercourse.</i> The men of sound wisdom<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis.</i> also applied the death penalty to those who performed this act.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yevamot</i> 83b.</i> Scripture employed respectable language in saying [thou shalt not lie].<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lie</i> is a euphemism for intercourse.</i> Compare, <i>thou shalt not approach</i> (v. 14).<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Approach</i> is a euphemism for intercourse.</i> Now, since the male was created to make<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">To penetrate the woman and thus impregnate her.</i> and the female to be made,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">To be penetrated and impregnated.</i> Scripture notes that one should not reverse the words of God. There is a type of laying whose aim is to emit semen.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>mishkeve</i> literally means layings of. I.E.’s point is that <i>mishkeve</i> here refers to laying down for the purpose of pouring seed; i.e., it is a euphemism for intercourse.</i> Hence Scripture employs the term <i>mishkeve</i> which is a plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Both partners in the homosexual act emit semen. Hence the plural <i>mishkeve</i> (Krinsky).</i> It is unfit to dwell at length on this. 
Scripture states <i>it is abomination</i>, for it is an abomination to a holy soul even by the laws of nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">It is not only prohibited by the Torah, it is unnatural.</i> 

Verse 23

I have already explained the word <i>shekhovtekha</i> (lie carnally).<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 20.</i> It is possible that the word <i>shekhovtekha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, your laying.</i> is derived from <i>shekhivah</i> (lying), for the emission of semen comes along with lying.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Hence laying is a euphemism for ejaculation.</i> As Scripture states to defile <i>thyself with her</i> (v. 20) with regard to a married woman, it similarly says so with regard to a beast.
AND…ANY BEAST. A female beast.
BEFORE A BEAST. A male beast.
TO LIE DOWN THERETO.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>le-rivah</i> (to lie her down) i.e., to have intercourse with her.</i> <i>Le-rivah</i> reverts to the beast, for the woman is the one who is penetrated.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-rivah</i> literally means to lie her down, i.e., to have intercourse with her. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> The word <i>rivah</i> (lie down) is related to the word <i>arba’ah</i> (four).<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">An animals lies down on all fours.</i>
IT IS PERVERSION. The grammarians say that the word <i>tevel</i> (perversion) comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>bet, lamed, lamed</i>.</i> Compare, <i>temes</i> (melteth)<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Whose root is <i>mem, samekh, samekh</i>.</i> in <i>which melteth and passeth away</i> (Ps. 58:9). The <i>tav</i> of <i>tevel</i> is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">It has no translatable meaning.

This is the general rule: Scripture prohibits all kinds of women with which it is possible for a person to be alone;<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Close relatives.

THESE. <i>Ha-el</i> (these) and <i>ha-elleh</i> (these) (v. 29) have one meaning. Compare, <i>ha-hem</i> (those) and <i>ha-hemah</i> (those). However, this is not the opinion of the Gaon.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 19:8 (Vol. 1, p. 204).</i>

Chapter 19



Verse 1



Verse 2

[UNTO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] The reason that Scripture states <i>unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</i> is to exclude strangers<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. <i>Mikra’ot Gedolot</i> reads, <i>The reason why Scripture states unto all the congregation of the children of Israel is to <span class="underline">include</span> the strangers</i>. The reading in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 appears correct, for <i>unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</i> seems to imply that what follows only applies to the children of Israel. Furthermore, in his comments on Lev. 20:1, I.E. explicitly says that our chapter applies only to the children of Israel. By strangers I.E. means non-Jews living in Israel. See I.E. on Ex. 20:9 (Vol. 2, p. 427).</i> since they, like the Israelites, are commanded to abstain from prohibited sexual relations. 
The reason this chapter follows the one dealing with prohibited sexual relations is that the Israelites should not imagine that they would remain in the land by observing only the laws dealing with the prohibited sexual relations. God informs them that there are other commandments. If they do not observe them, they will be exiled from the land. The aforementioned are the ten statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In our chapter. Our chapter, as I.E. goes on to explain, contains ten precepts which parallel the Decalogue.</i> God warns against idol worship after stating, <i>I the Lord…am holy</i> which, according to many commentators, is parallel to the first statement of the Decalogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>For I the Lord…am holy</i> (Ex. 20:7).</i> <i>And ye shall not swear by my name falsely</i> (v. 12) is parallel to <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</i> (Ex. 20:7).

Verse 3

AND YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. This parallels <i>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy</i> (Ex. 20:8). <i>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</i> is similar to <i>Honor thy father and thy mother</i> (Ex. 20:12). <i>Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor</i> (v. 16) is likewise the same as the statement <i>Thou shalt not murder</i> (Ex. 20:13). The law regarding the bondmaid designated for a man (v. 20) is parallel to <i>Thou shalt not commit adultery</i> (Ex. 20:13 with a free woman. Similarly, <i>Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another</i> (v. 11); <i>Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor</i> (v. 13) are parallel to the three remaining statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Decalogue. <i>Ye shall not steal</i> is parallel to <i>Thou shalt not steal</i> (Ex. 20:13). <i>Neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another</i> is parallel to <i>Thou shalt not bear false witness</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.). <i>Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor</i> is parallel to <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> (Ex. 20:14).</i> I have previously told you in my comments on the Torah portion <i>Ve-Elleh Ha-Mishpatim</i> (now these are the ordinances) (Ex. 21:1) that each and every precept stands by itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Each and every precept is an independent statement.

See I.E. on Ex. 21:2 (Vol. 2, p. 448).</i> However,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>lakhen</i> (literally, therefore). However, I.E. occasionally uses the term <i>lakhen</i> in the sense of however (Filwarg). It is also possible that we should read <i>akeh</i> rather than <i>lakhen</i>.</i> there is some support for connecting the verses.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If we try, we can find a reason that the commandments follow each other.</i> Note, the section that opens with the words <i>Ye shall be holy</i> (v. 2) begins with <i>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</i> (v. 3). Now Scripture tells us that the years of the one who honors his parents will be long (Ex. 20:12). This implies that the days of one who disrespects his parents will be shortened. Scripture therefore says, <i>Ye shall fear</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20:12 reads, <i>Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long</i>. The implication is that one who disrespects his parents will suffer premature death. According to I.E. the meaning of <i>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and father</i> is, be afraid of disrespecting your parents, for if you dishonor them you will suffer dire consequences. Our verse is thus parallel to Ex. 20:12.</i> The reason Scripture mentions the mother before the father is that a child first recognizes only its mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. our verse is directed at a child. Hence it mentions the mother first. When the Bible mentions the father first (Ex. 20:12) it is directed at an adult.</i> Then it recognizes its father. The Torah next mentions the Sabbath because, unlike all the other festivals, a child is commanded to keep the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. a father is obligated to prevent his child from doing work on the Sabbath. See I.E. on Ex. 20:8 (Vol. 2, p. 426).</i> The child shall then recognize his God who rested on the seventh day.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">By resting on the Sabbath the child will come to know that there is a God in the world. Hence our verse concludes with <i>I am the Lord your God</i>. I.E. speaks of a progression. The child learns to recognize its mother, then its father, and then God.</i> Scripture next mentions, <i>Turn ye not unto the idols</i> (v. 4). We know from tradition what Scripture means by fearing parents.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Sifra</i> fearing one’s father refers to sitting in his place, speaking in his turn, and contradicting him. See <i>Sifra</i> on this verse.</i> Our verse employs the word <i>ish</i> (every man) once<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Elsewhere the Torah uses the term <i>ish ish</i>. See Lev. 17:3,10,13; Lev. 15:2.</i> because it wants to be brief. Scripture employs the plural <i>tira’u</i> (ye shall fear)<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ish</i> is in the singular. Thus the verb governing it should be in the singular. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> because those who observe the child have to teach him and force him to fear his parents. It is the same case regarding Sabbath observance.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Those who observe the child violating the Sabbath have to correct him.</i> 
The meaning of <i>I am the Lord your God</i> is, act as I did, for I rested from all work on the Sabbath.

Verse 4

TURN YE NOT. Even in your hearts to look upon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Do not even think about looking at idols.</i>
UNTO THE IDOLS.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>elilim</i>.</i> The reference is to statues. They are called <i>elilim</i> because they are false objects. Compare the word <i>elil</i> (no value) in <i>Ye are physicians of no value</i> (Job 13:4). It is possibly related to the word <i>al</i> (not). <i>Elilim</i> means things that do not exist.
NOR…MOLTEN GODS. Made to receive power from those who are on high, for there is no need for another god along with Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 31:19 (Vol. 1, p. 300); Ex. 20:20 (Vol. 2, p. 437).</i> Scripture therefore states,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">At the end of our verse.</i> <i>I am the Lord your God</i>. Scripture employs the plurals <i>tifnu</i> (turn ye) and <i>ta’asu</i> (make), for the one who sees idol worship and does not reveal the matter is a partner of the idolater.

Verse 5

AND WHEN YE OFFER A SACRIFICE OF PEACE-OFFERINGS. This is connected to what is written above.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The previous verse.</i> It means that one shall not sacrifice to the demons, no-gods,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of Deut. 32:17’s description of idols.</i> but only unto God. Scripture employs the plural <i>tizbechu</i> (ye offer), for Scripture is speaking about what is most prevalent, for people to join together to offer a sacrifice. 
Scripture reads <i>li-retzonekhem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, in accordance with your will.</i> (that ye may be accepted) because they shall not be forced to bring the offering but shall offer it of their own free will.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

BUT EVERY ONE THAT EATETH IT. The meaning of <i>okhelav</i> is every one that eats of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Okhelav</i> is a plural. It literally means they that eat of it. Our verse thus literally reads, they that eat of it shall bear his iniquity. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> Similarly <i>But the righteous are secure as a young lion</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Prov. 28:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the meaning of Prov. 28:1 is, each one of the righteous is secure as a young lion. See I.E. on Gen. 49:22 (Vol. 1, p. 44, notes 156,157).</i>
BECAUSE HE HATH PROFANED THE HOLY THING OF THE LORD. After he offered the parts designated to God by Scripture, all the flesh<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Of the sacrifice.</i> is holy. <i>Chillel</i> (profaned) is related to the word <i>chol</i> (profane). It is something that has no significance.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, meaning.</i> It is like an empty space (<i>challel</i>). In this section<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike Lev. 7:18.</i> Scripture explains the punishment,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">For eating on the third day from that which remains of a peace offering.</i> namely, <i>and that soul shall be cut off</i>.

Verse 9

[AND WHEN YE REAP THE HARVEST.] This follows the law dealing with the peace offering, for as you gave to God the parts designated in Scripture, so shall you, out of respect for God, give what Scripture designates from the harvest of your land<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 9 and 10.</i> for the poor and the stranger. The word <i>u-ve-kutzrekhem</i> (and when ye reap the harvest) is grammatically irregular.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The word should have been vocalized with a <i>kamatz katan</i> rather than with a <i>kubbutz</i>. In other words, <i>u-ve-kutzrekhem</i> should have read <i>u-ve-kotzrekhem</i>.</i> It is an infinitive<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">With a pronominal suffix.</i> in the <i>kal</i>.
THE CORNER OF THY FIELD. The Israelite shall leave a corner in the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field</i> means you shall leave a corner of the field.</i>
THE GLEANING. The meaning of <i>leket</i> (gleaning) is known.

Verse 10

GLEAN. <i>Te’olel</i> (glean) means to cut off the <i>olelot</i>, that is the young grapes. Compare, <i>olel</i> (young child). Very young children are also called <i>yonekot</i> (sucklings).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See Lam. 2:11, <i>olel ve-yonek</i> (young children and the sucklings).</i> This word<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Olel</i> means a young child or a young plant. <i>Te’olel</i> thus appears to mean to plant a young shoot. However, it has the opposite meaning. It means to harvest a young plant. Thus a word coming from a root meaning a young plant can, in the <i>pi’el</i>, have the opposite meaning, i.e., to destroy a young plant.</i> is similar to <i>shereshkha</i> (root thee out)<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shereshkha</i> comes from the stem meaning root. Thus the word might be taken to mean to root. However, it has the opposite meaning in the <i>pi’el</i>.</i> in <i>And root thee out of the land of the living</i> (Ps. 52:7), the meaning of which is, to cut the root. Similarly the meaning <i>of mesa’ef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mesa’ef</i> comes from the same root as <i>se’if</i> (a branch). However, in the <i>p’iel</i> it means to cut the branches.</i> <i>purah</i> (Is. 10:33) is to lop the boughs.
THE FALLEN FRUIT. The meaning of <i>peret</i> (fallen fruit) is known in the words of tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>perat</i> is often used in Rabbinic tradition and there has the meaning of that which is singled out. See <i>Sotah</i> 37b; <i>Chagigah</i> 6a. Thus <i>peret</i> means the single grapes that fall off the vine. See <i>Pe’ah</i> 6:5, <i>Two grapes are peret; three are not peret</i>.</i> It is related to the word <i>poretim</i> (thrum)<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>ha-poretim…al ha-navel</i> means those that pluck on each one of the strings of the psaltery.</i> in <i>That thrum on the psaltery</i> (Amos 6:5).
FOR THE POOR. Of Israel.
AND FOR THE STRANGER. Who lives among you.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The non-Jewish stranger. See I.E. on verse 2 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 11

[YE SHALL NOT STEAL.] <i>Ye shall not steal</i> follows,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The laws of leaving part of the produce to the poor.</i> for Scripture, as it were, says I have commanded that you give from your property to the poor out of respect for God.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>I am the Lord your God</i> (v. 10) which concludes the laws of leaving part of the produce to the poor.</i> You shall certainly not take what belongs to others. 
Scripture employs the plural <i>Ye shall not steal</i>, for the one who sees and is silent is also a thief.
NEITHER SHALL YE DEAL FALSELY. This applies to something which has been deposited with you. The one who knows and does not testify also deals falsely.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the plural, “ye.”</i>
NOR LIE. Seek money from one who does not owe you anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The verse deals with appropriating someone else’s property. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 12

[AND YE SHALL NOT SWEAR BY MY NAME FALSELY.] This follows <i>Ye shall not steal</i>, for the one who is suspected of theft and dealing falsely with regard to a deposit swears.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 5:20-25.</i> Scripture employs the plural <i>ye shall not swear</i> because it wants to include the one who causes an oath to be taken.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">One is not permitted to concoct a story and force someone to take an unnecessary oath (Krinsky).</i> 
Scripture reads, <i>so that thou profane the name of thy God</i> because, as I have noted,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 20:7 (Vol. 2, pp. 423-425).</i> the one who swears falsely denies God.

Verse 13

THOU SHALT NOT OPPRESS THY NEIGHBOR. In secret.
NOR ROB HIM. Openly by the use of force.
THE WAGES. <i>Pe’ulat</i> means the wages of.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>pe’ulat</i> literally means labor of. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Compare, <i>Behold, His reward</i> (u-fe’ulato) <i>is with Him</i> (Is. 40:10). It is possible that Scripture is elliptical and that <i>pe’ulat</i> is short for <i>sekhar pe’ulato</i> (the wages of his labor). Many say that Scripture speaks of a person hired for the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">According to this opinion a person hired for the day must be paid as soon as the day is over.</i> One is not permitted to tell him to work the next morning and in the morning say I will pay you for two days’ work. The transmitters of tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bava Metzi’a</i> 61a.</i> say that our verse<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Which states that a worker must be paid before the morning.</i> refers to someone hired for a day,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis a person hired for the day must be paid before the arrival of the next morning.</i> for the sun is not permitted to set on a worker<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">An unpaid worker.</i> who is hired for the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the verse in Deut. 19:24 which states that a worker’s wages are to be paid before the sun sets speaks of a worker hired for the night; that is, the employer has the entire following day to pay him.</i>

Verse 14

[THOU SHALT NOT CURSE THE DEAF.] Because you have the power to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Hence our verse follows verse 13, which speaks of the misuse of power to oppress and rob.</i> You shall likewise not put a stumbling block before the blind.
BUT THOU SHALT FEAR THY GOD. For He is able to punish you and make you deaf and blind.

Verse 15

YE SHALL DO NO UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. Scripture speaks of the judges and the witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it employs the plural.</i>
THE PERSON OF THE MIGHTY. Great in money such as Barzillai (II Sam. 19:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Barzillai the Gileadite, a friend of King David. Scripture described Barzillai as a very great man. The context makes it clear that the reference is to great wealth, for Barzillai sustained King David when David dwelt in Mahanim.</i>

Verse 16

A TALEBEARER. The word <i>rakhil</i> (talebearer) is similar to <i>rekhulltekh</i> (thy merchandise) (Ezek. 26:12) and <i>rokhel</i> (merchant) in <i>With all powders of the merchant</i> (Cant. 3:6). <i>Rakhil</i> means a slanderer, for the merchant moves goods. He buys from one person and sells to another. The talebearer reveals to one person what he heard from another person.
NEITHER SHALT THOU STAND IDLY BY THE BLOOD OF THY NEIGHBOR. A person should not join bloodthirsty men.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, men of blood, persons who resort to violence to gain their end. See Prov. 29:10.</i> It is known that many people have been murdered and killed because of slander.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor</i> follows the law prohibiting tale-bearing.</i> Doeg the Edomite<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Doeg told King Saul that Achimelech, the <i>kohen</i> of Nob, fed David. This resulted in the destruction of the city of Nob. See I Sam. 22:19.</i> is proof of this. 
The meaning of <i>I am the Lord</i> is, I see what you do in secret.

Verse 17

THOU SHALT NOT HATE THY BROTHER IN THY HEART. This is the reverse of <i>but thou shalt love thy neighbor</i> (v. 18). Now all of these commandments are implanted in the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">They are rational laws. See I.E. on Ex. 20:1 (Vol. 1, pp. 407,408); <i>Yesod Mora</i>, Chapter 5.</i> Israel will dwell in the land when they observe them, for the second temple was destroyed because of hatred of one’s neighbor for no reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 10:9.</i>
THOU SHALT SURELY REBUKE THY NEIGHBOR. Perhaps you suspected him of something which was not so.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">If you rebuke your neighbor he may explain himself and you will learn that you had no reason to be angry at him.</i> The meaning of <i>and not bear sin because of him</i> is that you be punished because of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">If you suspect him of something of which he is innocent (Weiser).</i>

Verse 18

THOU SHALT NOT TAKE VENGEANCE, NOR BEAR ANY GRUDGE. This is explained in the words of our rabbis of blessed memory.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on this verse. “If one says to another, Lend me your sickle, and he replies, No. The next day the latter says to the former, Lend me your hatchet, and he replies, I am not going to lend it to you, just as you refused to lend me your sickle—this is taking vengeance…If one says to another, Lend me your sickle, and he replies, No! and the next day the latter says to the former, Lend me your hatchet, and he replies, Here it is; I am not like you, because you would not lend me—this is called bearing a grudge.” See also <i>Yoma</i> 23a.</i>
BUT THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOR. Many are of the opinion that the <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-re’akha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-re’akha</i> literally means to thy neighbor.</i> (thy neighbor) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">If we take <i>le-re’akha</i> literally, then our verse reads, but thou shalt love to thy neighbor as thyself. This does not appears to make sense. Hence this interpretation means that we should ignore the <i>lamed</i> prefixed to <i>re’akha</i> and interpret our verse as reading, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</i> It is like the <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-avner</i> (Abner) (II Sam. 3:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-avner</i> is to be interpreted as if written <i>avner</i>.</i> I believe that <i>le-re’akha</i> is to be taken literally.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-re’akha</i> (thy neighbor) is not superfluous.</i> Its meaning is that one should love that which is good for one’s neighbor as he does for himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. interprets the <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-re’akha</i> as meaning “for.” He interprets our verse as follows: You shall love for your neighbor what you love for yourself (Krinsky). Weiser claims that I.E. interprets the <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-re’akha</i> as meaning “of.” He interprets our verse as follows: You shall love of your neighbor’s welfare as you love your own welfare.</i> 
The meaning of <i>I am the Lord</i> is, I the Lord alone created all of you.

Verse 19

[THOU SHALT NOT LET THY CATTLE GENDER WITH A DIVERSE KIND.] The reason Scripture states <i>Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind</i> is to warn us. Since you are holy, in that you do not act violently towards your fellow human being, you must also not do anything to an animal which entails changing God’s work. Scripture therefore reads, <i>Ye shall keep My statutes</i>; that is, each species is to be preserved. A kind is not to interbreed with another kind.
WITH A DIVERSE KIND. <i>Kilayim</i> (a diverse kind) means two kinds. I will yet explain the meaning of <i>kilayim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently never got around to this (Weiser).</i> The reason for the law regarding a field and a garment is that they serve as reminders,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">They remind us not to alter the species, which God has created, by crossbreeding or cross-planting.</i> for many commandments serve as reminders. Examples of the latter are: the festival of unleavened bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The unleavened bread serves as a reminder of Exodus. See Deut. 16:3.</i> Sukkot,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>sukkot</i> serve as a reminder of booths in which the Israelites dwelled during their sojourn in the desert (Lev. 23:43).</i> <i>tzitzit</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tzitzit</i> serve as a reminder of God’s commandments (Num. 15:39).</i> <i>shofar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture speaks of Rosh Ha-Shanah as being a memorial proclaimed with the blast of the horn.

Know that “the complete is very complete.”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">A person who is spiritually perfect does not need any reminder of what God desires of him, for on his own he knows God’s will.</i> Scripture therefore says with regard to Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Who was complete.</i> <i>and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws</i> (Gen. 26:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham on his own knew and kept God’s charge, commandments, statutes, and laws</i>
OF TWO KINDS. The transmitters of tradition said that the word <i>shatnez</i> (two kinds) is made up of three words.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis the term <i>shatnez</i> is a combination of <i>shu’a</i> (hackled), <i>tavuy</i> (spun), and <i>nuz</i> (twined).</i> It may come from a five-letter root.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>shin, ayin, tet, nun, zayin</i>.</i> The meaning of <i>shatnez</i> is “mixed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to a garment made out of a mixture of linen and wool.

Verse 20

A BONDMAID, DESIGNATED FOR A MAN. The deniers<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that the bondmaid is not a Jewess. However, the correct interpretation according to the plain meaning of the text is that the bondmaid is the one mentioned in <i>And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant</i> (Ex. 21:7) and that she is an Israelite. Our verse deals with an instance in which the bondmaid was designated for marriage to her master or his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 21:8,9.</i> However, she had not undergone the first stage of marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">In ancient times marriage was effectuated in two stages. The first stage was called <i>erusin</i>. During the period of <i>erusin</i>, which lasted for a year, the bride remained with her family. In the second stage, called <i>nesu’im</i>, the bride went to live with her husband.</i> The meaning of <i>nor was freedom given her</i> is that she is not free until she undergoes the first stage of marriage as is the practice of young ladies. 
Many believe that <i>necherefet</i> means designated. However, I believe that <i>necherefet</i> is related to the word <i>cherpah</i> (reproach) because she is an unmarried virgin maidservant under the control of a stranger.
REDEEMED. <i>Hofdeh</i> (redeemed) is an infinitive in the <i>hofal</i>. The meaning of <i>and not at all redeemed</i> is that her father or any other family member did not redeem her before she became a young woman.
FREEDOM. The <i>shuruk</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kubbutz</i>.</i> in <i>chufshah</i> (freedom) is in place of a furtive <i>kamatz</i>, for the individual form of the word is <i>chofesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Nouns that are vocalized <i>cholam, segol</i> are vocalized with a <i>kamatz katan</i> when declined. Compare, <i>kotel, kotlah</i>; <i>chodesh, chodshah</i>. Thus <i>chufshah</i> should have read <i>chofshah</i>, for the word <i>chufshah</i> (freedom) is the word <i>chofesh</i> plus the pronominal suffix.</i> Scripture states, <i>nor was freedom given her</i>, because it was traditional to write a writ of manumission<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">When she was released from bondage.</i> if her father sold her for a set time. The transmitters of tradition said that our verse speaks of a woman who was half free and half servant.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Keritot</i> 2:5. “What manner of bondwoman [does Scripture speak of in Lev. 19:20]? She that is half bondwoman and half freedwoman.”</i> What they said is true.
THERE SHALL BE AN INQUISITION. Some say that <i>bikkoret</i> (inquisition) means a concubine.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation renders <i>bikkoret tiheyeh</i> (there shall be an inquisition) as she shall be a concubine; that is, she shall not be considered a fully married woman.</i> They say that the same applies to the word <i>biykkrotekha</i> (among thy favorites) in <i>Kings’ daughters are among thy favorites</i> (Ps. 45:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation renders Ps. 45:10, Kings’ daughters are your concubines.</i> However, they did not explain it correctly, for the meaning of <i>biykkrotekha</i> is, among the precious handmaidens.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>biykkrotekha</i> is the word <i>yikkrotekha</i> (your precious ones), i.e., your precious maidens plus the <i>bet</i> prefix. There is no connection between <i>bikkoret</i> and <i>biykkrotekha</i>, for the former comes from the root <i>bet, kof, resh</i> and the latter from the root <i>yod, kof, resh</i>.</i> The <i>yod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>biykkrotekha</i>.</i> is missing<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Is silent.</i> because the <i>bet</i>, which serves as a preposition, is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>yod</i> of <i>yikkrotekha</i> is swallowed up by the <i>chirik</i>.</i> It is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> because of the confluence of two mobile <i>shevas</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Biyikkrotekha</i> is a combination of the prefix <i>be</i> plus the word <i>yekkrotekha</i>.

See <i>Makkot</i> 3:12. This interpretation renders <i>bikkoret</i> as cattled, i.e., lashed with a strap made of cattle hide. In our texts of Rabbinic literature there is no such interpretation. Radak quotes this interpretation in the name of Rabbi Saadiah Gaon. See Weiser.</i> This is true by way of tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The law that the bondwoman is whipped with a strap made from cattle hide is true.

Verse 21



Verse 22

AND HE SHALL BE FORGIVEN.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-nislach lo</i>.</i> I will explain this later.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">In his comments on Num. 14:19, I.E. explains that the meaning of <i>ve-nislach</i> is that punishment shall be delayed until the person fully repents. See Volume 4, p. 110.</i> The reason Scripture now discusses forbidden fruit is that Scripture had previously mentioned the seed of the field<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i> and the seed of the woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i> who is likened to the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 12:2.</i> Scripture therefore<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Because it had previously mentioned seed with regard to the field and a woman.</i> now mentions that which is planted. It is known that fruit which grows before three years have passed is of no value and is harmful to the body. It is like all fish that have no fins and scales that are injurious to the body,0 and like all flesh of birds of prey and unclean animals that harm the wise soul. The intelligent will understand this.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 11:43.</i>

Verse 23

[THEN YE SHALL COUNT THE FRUIT THEREOF AS FORBIDDEN.] The meaning of <i>ve-areltem et orlato</i> (then ye shall count as forbidden) is that the fruit is counted as a foreskin<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>ve-areltem et orlato</i> as, and you shall consider its fruit as foreskin. <i>Orlah</i> means a foreskin.

See Ex. 6:12.</i> the ear,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">A metaphor for something which interferes with hearing. See Jer. 6:10.</i> and the foreskin of the penis. 
The meaning of <i>ve-areltem</i> (then ye shall count) is, you shall consider it as a foreskin. It is also beautifully explained in the Aramaic translation.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>ve-areltem et orlato</i>, you shall surely distance.</i> 
SHALL IT BE AS FORBIDDEN<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hebrew, arelim</i> (literally, foreskins).</i> 
UNTO YOU.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders this, it shall be as foreskins forbidden unto you.</i> This explains the meaning of <i>ve-areltem</i> (then ye shall count).<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the meaning of <i>ve-areltem</i> is, then you shall consider it as a foreskin.</i>

Verse 24

SHALL BE HOLY, FOR GIVING PRAISE. For giving praise to the Lord. The <i>kohen</i> shall eat it.

Verse 25

[THAT IT MAY YIELD UNTO YOU MORE RICHLY THE INCREASE THEREOF.] <i>That it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof is</i> connected to <i>shall be holy, for giving praise</i> (v. 24) even though it is some distance from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>That it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof</i> is connected to <i>shall be holy, for giving praise</i> even though it does not immediately follow it.</i> <i>If he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft</i> (Ex. 22:2) is similarly connected to <i>he shall pay five oxen for an ox</i> (Ex. 21:37). There are many other similar instances. 
The meaning of <i>I am the Lord your God</i> is, I will place a blessing upon the produce.

Verse 26

YE SHALL NOT EAT WITH THE BLOOD. This is connected<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">That is, related.</i> to what is written above it.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">To the law which precedes it.</i> Scripture warned against eating from the fruit of any planted tree until the fifth year. It similarly also prohibited one, if he is in the proximity of the sanctuary, to eat from any permitted flesh unless its blood first be sprinkled on the altar of God. The account of King Saul is a faithful witness to this interpretation, for the ark of the Lord was with Saul, and Scripture explicitly states, “Behold, the people are eating with the blood.”<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">See I Sam. 14:33. The exact reading of the latter is, <i>Behold, the people sin against the Lord, in that they eat with the blood</i>.</i> As I explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 17:7.</i> it was as if the people were sacrificing to the demons, for this was their custom in Egypt. There they were accustomed to sacrifice in the name of the demons. Now this is clear,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">That the animal was sacrificed to the demons (Weiser). Or I.E.’s interpretation of <i>Ye shall not eat with the blood</i> is clear (Krinsky).</i> since the blood was not poured on the altar in the worship of God. <i>Neither shall ye practice divination</i> is connected to <i>ye shall not eat with the blood</i> because they used to eat with the blood and go astray after the demons in Egypt, and they used to practice divination and soothsaying in Canaan. The aforementioned is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 18:10-14.</i> This too was like the <i>doings of the land of Egypt;</i>…and…<i>the doings of the land of Canaan</i> (Lev. 18:3). The word <i>menachesh</i> means divines. Compare, <i>I have observed the signs</i> (nichashti), <i>And the Lord hath blessed me</i> (Gen. 30:27). Divinations take many forms. There are types of divination that employs images,<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Making predictions based on the images drawn on cards (Krinsky).</i> sticks,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Such as making predictions based on the way sticks fall.</i> actions,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Making predictions based on whom a person meets or what happens to something a person owns, i.e., a black cat crossing one’s path or a mirror breaking.</i> movements,<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Bodily movements.</i> days,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Lucky days.</i> and hours.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Lucky hours.</i>
SOOTHSAYING. Some say that the word <i>te’onennu</i> (soothsaying) is related to the word <i>anah</i> (answer). The soothsayer imagines something in his heart and inclines his ear to hear what the speaker will answer.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">The practitioner of this type of divination has a question in mind. He does not reveal the question to the person whom he is speaking to. However, he divines an answer to his question from what the person with whom he is conversing says. According to this interpretation <i>ve-lo te’onennu</i> means “and do not practice answering.”</i> However, the rule of grammar rejects this interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Anah</i> (answer) comes from the root <i>ayin, nun, heh</i>. Verbs from this root do not double their middle stem.</i> There are those who say that <i>te’onennu</i> comes from the word <i>onah</i> (time). It is similar to the word <i>onatah</i> (her conjugal rights)<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The time set aside for conjugal rights.</i> in <i>and her conjugal rights, shall he not diminish</i> (Ex. 21:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>ve-lo te’onennu</i> is, and do not set times; that is, do not divine by setting aside lucky days.</i> However, it appears to me that <i>te’onennu</i> is related to the word <i>anan</i> (cloud), for it is known that the one who practices divination looks at the clouds and observes their forms and their movements. <i>Te’onennu</i> probably comes from a verb with a doubled root.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>ayin, nun, nun</i>.</i> It is like the word <i>tesovevu</i> (you will go round about),<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Which comes from the root <i>samekh, bet, bet</i>.</i> for we find, <i>And with soothsayers</i> (onenim) <i>like the Philistines</i> (Is. 2:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Onenim</i> is a <i>kal</i>. There is no question that <i>onenim</i> comes from the root <i>ayin, nun, nun</i>.</i> [I note this] for it is possible that <i>te’onennu</i> is a doubled form.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">A word from the root <i>ayin, vav, nun</i>. A verb which has a <i>vav</i> as it middle letter has its last stem letter doubled in the <i>pi’el</i>. In other words, the root of <i>te’onennu</i> is <i>ayin, vav, nun</i>. The last stem letter is doubled in the <i>pi’el</i>. Compare, <i>te-komem</i> from <i>kof, vav, mem</i>.</i> <i>Me’onen</i> (one that uses divination) <i>u-menachesh</i> (Deut. 18:9) is proof.

Verse 27

[YE SHALL NOT ROUND THE CORNERS OF YOUR HEADS.] Scripture states, <i>Ye shall not round the corners of your heads</i> as the non-Jewish nations do, so that you will be separated from them. Now since the hair on the head and the beard serve to glorify a person it is unfit to destroy them. Some say that this verse is connected to <i>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead</i> (v. 28), for there are people who destroy the hair on the corner of their heads and also on the corner of their beards for the dead.

Verse 28

CUTTINGS. We know the meaning of the corners of the head and of the beard from the words of tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kiddushin</i> 32b.</i> 
The word <i>le-nefesh</i> means for a dead body. It is also so rendered in the Aramaic translation.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>la-nefesh, al mit</i>.</i> This is its true meaning. The <i>nun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>la-nefesh</i>.</i> does not receive a <i>dagesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">A preposition prefixed to a stressed syllable of a noun can be vocalized with a <i>sheva, pattach</i>, or <i>kamatz</i>. If it is vocalized with <i>a pattach</i>, the letter which follows it receives a <i>dagesh</i>. I.E. explains that Scripture chose to vocalize <i>la-nefesh</i> with a <i>kamatz</i> to simplify enunciation (Weiser). However, it should be noted that if the <i>lamed</i> of <i>la-nefesh</i> was vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>, then the <i>nun</i> would also not receive a <i>dagesh</i>. Thus I.E.’s interpretation does not explain why the <i>lamed</i> of <i>la-nefesh</i> was not vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>. It is possible that in I.E.’s version of the Torah <i>la-nefesh</i> was vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> and that I.E. is explaining why, contrary to the laws of grammar, there is no <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>nun</i> of <i>la-nefesh</i>.</i> in order to simplify enunciation.
IMPRINT ANY MARKS. Some say that this is connected to <i>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh</i>, for there are people who, employing fire, mark their bodies with a recognizable form for the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">They brand an image of the deceased into their flesh (Weiser).</i> Even today there are those who, while young, mark their faces so that they [may] be recognized.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">This is still practiced among certain Arab tribes (Weiser).</i> The word <i>ka’aka</i> (marks) is doubled.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kof</i> and <i>ayin</i> root letters are doubled.</i> Compare, <i>He that spread forth</i> the <i>earth and that which cometh out of it</i> (ve-tze’etza’ehah)<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tzadi</i> and <i>alef</i> of the root <i>yod, tzadi, alef</i> are doubled in <i>ve-tze’etza’ehah</i></i> (Is. 42:5). <i>Ka’aka</i> is related to the word <i>ve-hoka</i> (and hang)<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>resh, kof, ayin</i>.</i> in <i>and hang them up</i> (Num. 25:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">So too Rashi. “[<i>ka’aka</i> ] is a writing dug into the flesh. <i>Ka’aka</i> is related to <i>ve-hoka</i> in <i>and hang them up</i> (Num. 25:4)…” They were hanged upon poles which were driven into the ground.</i> According to the Aramaic translator, it is also an irregular word. He is also correct [in translating <i>ka’aka</i> as engraved].

Verse 29

[PROFANE NOT THY DAUGHTER.] Scripture now mentions <i>profane not thy daughter</i> because it earlier stated <i>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh</i> (v. 28). The import of our verse is, your daughter shall not be displayed before the public.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Your daughter shall not make markings upon her flesh for the dead because she may expose the place of the mark to show that she cut her flesh as a sign of mourning.</i> Now the voice of a woman is like her nakedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachot</i> 24a.</i> A cutting is certainly so.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">If it is prohibited to hear a women’s voice, it is certainly prohibited to look upon any part of her body that is exposed.</i>
LEST THE LAND FALL INTO HARLOTRY. The reference is to the harlotry of the people of the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>lest the land</i> is short for lest the people of the land.</i> Compare, <i>when a land sinneth against Me</i> (Ezek. 14:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, when the people of the land.</i>

Verse 30

[YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS.] Scripture now says, <i>Ye shall keep My sabbaths</i>, because it earlier<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 28.</i> dealt with the dead, for there is no mourning on the Sabbath. 
<i>And reverence My sanctuary</i> is to be understood as referring to the <i>kohen gadol;</i> he shall not act as other mourners do.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohen gadol</i> is not to observe mourning customs. See Lev. 21:10-12.</i> There is a similar prohibition upon all the people of the sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And reverence My sanctuary</i> applies to all those who serve in the sanctuary.</i> 
The meaning of <i>I am the Lord</i> is, God will punish you if you do not revere the sanctuary and respect it. Scripture similarly next mentions <i>the ghosts</i> and <i>the familiar spirits</i> (v. 31) because of the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture earlier spoke of the dead. It now tells us that we are not to inquire of the dead by employing a ghost or a familiar spirit.</i> It similarly writes in Isaiah <i>on behalf of the living unto the dead</i> (Is. 8:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">The full verse reads: <i>And when they say unto you: Seek unto the ghosts and the familiar spirits, that chirp and that mutter; should not a people seek unto their God? On behalf of the living unto the dead</i>; i.e., instead of seeking ghosts and familiar spirits and the dead concerning the welfare and future of the living, a people should inquire of God.</i>

Verse 31

THE GHOSTS. <i>Ovot</i> (ghosts) is related to the word <i>ovot</i> (wineskins) in <i>Like new wine-skins</i> (Job 32:19), for wineskins are the main instruments in this “art.”<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">The practitioners of this “art” use wineskins to make ghost-like sounds.</i>
NOR UNTO FAMILIAR SPIRITS. <i>Yidonim</i> (familiar spirits) is related to the word <i>da’at</i> (knowledge). Those who turn to <i>yidonim</i> seek to know the future. The empty heads say if there were no truth in the <i>ovot</i> (ghosts) and in various magical practices, then Scripture would not have prohibited them. However, I say the reverse. Scripture would not have permitted that which was true. It only prohibited that which is false. <i>The idols</i> (elilim)<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>elilim</i> means something which does not exist. See I.E. on verse 4.</i> and <i>the images</i> (v. 4) are proof of this. Were it not that I do not want to go on at length, I would have explained the incident of the woman who was an expert in divining by ghosts.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">The witch of En-dor. See I Sam 28:15. According to I.E the witch did not actually bring up the prophet Samuel. She employed trickery. See I.E. on Ex. 20:3 (Vol. 2, p. 418, and the notes thereto).</i> I would have brought unquestionable proof to my explanation. 
The meaning of <i>Turn ye not</i> is, do not turn to the one who knows the art.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Of communicating with the dead.</i> 
The meaning of <i>seek them not out</i> is, do not inquire of them as king Saul did. 
The meaning of <i>I am the Lord your God</i> is, you shall not seek except for the Lord alone. Note, Scripture reads, <i>to be defiled by them</i>, because the soul of the one who inquires of a ghost or a familiar spirit is defiled, for it does not cleave to the Lord.

Verse 32

[THOU SHALT RISE UP BEFORE THE HOARY HEAD.] Scripture mentions the hoary head because it earlier mentioned the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 28.</i> and the aged are close to death, for the bodies of the old are considered dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">They do not fully function.</i> Note, our verse refers to all the old and to every hoary head.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Contrary to the opinion that our verse refers only to an old man who has acquired wisdom. See <i>Kiddushin</i> 32b. Also see Rashi.</i> 
The meaning of <i>and thou shalt fear thy God</i> is, fear the Lord who shall punish you in your old age.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">If you do not respect the aged when you are young.</i>

Verse 33

AND IF A STRANGER SOUJORN WITH THEE. Scripture mentions the stranger after the old man. It does so to, as it were, to say, as I warned you to respect the old Israelite because he has no strength, I warn you not to wrong the foreigner because you are stronger than he is, or who has no power because he is in your country and subject to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">But is otherwise not powerless.</i>

Verse 34

AND THOU SHALT LOVE HIM AS THYSELF. This has been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 18.</i>

Verse 35

[YE SHALL DO NO UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.] Scripture states, <i>Ye shall do no unrighteousness</i> because it earlier dealt with the stranger. Our verse is similar to <i>and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him</i> (Deut. 1:16). You shall similarly not cheat in measurements; that is, you shall not deceive in measuring cubits, for the cubits vary.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">From person to person.</i> It is also possible that the meaning of <i>in judgment</i> is according to the known practice of the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Use a measure which is accepted in the land. Do not use a foreign measure.</i>

Verse 36

JUST BALANCES, JUST WEIGHT. <i>Avne tzedek</i><sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, just stones.</i> means just weights.
A JUST EPHAH. For that which is dry.
AND A JUST HIN. For liquid. <i>A just hin</i> explains <i>in measure</i> (v. 36). 
Scripture states, <i>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt</i>, because it earlier mentioned <i>for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt</i> (v. 34). Therefore, you are obligated to keep My statutes and ordinances in mind and observe them. 

Verse 37

The meaning of <i>I am the Lord</i> is, you shall pursue my statutes which I placed upon you, for they are all righteous.

Chapter 20



Verse 1

[AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING.] Scripture earlier<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19:2.</i> stated, <i>unto all the congregation…of Israel</i>, because the commandments, which followed, are obligatory upon all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That is, only upon Israel.</i> Strangers have no part in them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Non-Jews do not share these laws with Israel.</i> Scripture now begins to mention the punishment for harlotry, which will befall anyone who lives in the Land of Israel, be he native born<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">An Israelite.</i> or resident alien.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A non-Jew living in Israel. Hence our chapter explicitly notes that what follows applies to both an Israelite and a non-Israelite.</i> It begins with the most severe of them all, namely, with the individual who gives of his seed to Molech, that is, the one who has intercourse with a woman who worships idols.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation is rejected by the Mishnah. See <i>Megillah</i> 4:9: “If a man says <i>And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech</i> (Lev. 18:21) means, and thou shalt not give of thy seed to make it pass to heathendom, they put him to silence with a rebuke.”</i> 

Verse 2

The meaning of <i>the people of the land</i> is, the people of the land wherein the culprit resides, be he a native or a resident stranger.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The term “the land” indicates a specific land. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> This<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Stoning.</i> applies to one who publicly offers his offspring to Molach.

Verse 3

I ALSO WILL SET MY FACE AGAINST THAT MAN. If the sin was committed secretly.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For if the sin is committed in public, the culprit is executed (v. 2).</i> Others say that the reference<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>I also will set my face against that man</i>.</i> is to the extirpation of the culprit’s seed.
TO DEFILE MY SANCTUARY. Which is in the Land of Israel.
AND TO PROFANE MY HOLY NAME. For nations will hear.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Of the sin that was committed in the Land of Israel.</i> 
It would have appeared to us that <i>ba-even</i> (with stones)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, with a stone.</i> (v. 2) is a collective noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>ba-even</i> is to be rendered with stones.</i> Compare, <i>And I have oxen</i> (shor),<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, an ox.</i> <i>and asses</i> (chamor)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, an ass.</i> (Gen. 32:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and I have an ox and an ass.</i> However, the words of tradition are correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis took <i>ba-even</i> literally. According to the Midrash the culprit was first stoned by one stone. See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 6:4, “The place of stoning was twice the height of a man. One of the witnesses knocked him down…If he died that sufficed; but if not, the second witness took a stone and dropped it on his heart. If he died that sufficed; but if not, he was stoned by all Israel.”</i> They are true. Rabbi Jonah the Spanish grammarian who rests in paradise says that <i>and against his family</i> (v. 5) means all those like him.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Jonah was bothered by God’s threatening the family of the sinner with punishment when they apparently did not commit any sin.</i> Who brought us into this trouble?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Of not interpreting our verse literally.</i> Our verse is to be taken literally.

Verse 4



Verse 5

[AND ALL THAT GO ASTRAY AFTER HIM.] This means others will go astray if the culprit is not put to death.

Verse 6

AND THE SOUL THAT TURNETH UNTO THE GHOSTS. This means as I will cut off the one who gives from his seed to Molech in secret or in public if the people of the land do not kill him, so will I cut off the one who strays from me and turns to ghosts. We find the term <i>nefashim</i> (souls) (Ezek. 20:13) in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nefashim</i> (souls) is masculine. <i>Nefesh</i> (soul) is usually feminine. However, our verse reads, <i>ve-hikhratti oto</i> (and will cut him [the soul] off). It thus treats <i>nefesh</i> as masculine. I.E. therefore points out that <i>nefesh</i> is sometimes treated as a masculine in Scripture.</i> We also find <i>all the souls</i> (nefesh) <i>were fourteen</i> (arba’ah asar)<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Arba’ah asar</i> (fourteen) is masculine. Thus Gen. 46:22 treats <i>nefesh</i> as masculine.</i> (Gen. 46:22). We similarly read,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> <i>and will cut him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The soul.</i> (oto) <i>off</i>.

Verse 7

SANCTIFY YOURSELVES THEREFORE, AND BE YE HOLY; FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. <i>Ki ani Adonai Elohekhem</i> (for I am the Lord your God) means for I the Lord your God am holy. I have given you statutes to observe in order to sanctify you.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">That is, I who am holy have given you statutes in order to sanctify you.</i> Scripture has already mentioned this.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 11:44.</i> It repeats this command so as to include the strangers residing among Israel, for they too are obligated to be holy so that they may continue to be allowed to dwell in a holy land.

Verse 9

Scripture begins the list of punishments at the beginning of the section<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the list of punishments for the sins following verse 7, which reads, <i>Sanctify yourselves therefore and be holy</i>.</i> with the person who curses his father in the same manner that Scripture earlier starts with <i>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</i> (Lev. 19:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding verse is, <i>Ye shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy</i> (Lev. 19:2).</i> Our verse mentions the father before the mother out of respect for the father. It is unlike <i>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Where the mother is placed before the father.</i> for he is not put to death if he has not reached the age of <i>mitzvah</i> observance.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Hence our verse speaks of an adult. Scripture thus places the father before the mother. However, Lev. 19:3 speaks of a minor. Hence it places mother before father. See I.E.’s comment on Lev. 19:3: “The reason Scripture mentions the mother before the father is that a child first recognizes only its mother. Then it recognizes its father.”</i>
FOR WHATSOEVER MAN THERE BE THAT CURSETH HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, For whatsoever man there be that curses his father and his mother shall surely be put to death.</i> The phrase <i>asher yekallel</i> (that curseth) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse is to be read as if written, “and whoever curses his mother.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse should be interpreted as if written: For whatsoever man there be that curses his father or that curses his mother shall surely be put to death.</i> <i>He hath cursed his father or his mother</i> is another way of saying he has committed a great abomination.
HIS BLOOD SHALL BE UPON HIM. Compare, <i>his blood shall be upon his head</i> (Josh. 2:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">He, not the one who executes him, is responsible for his death.</i> The blood of those who are stoned and strangled is upon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">They are responsible for their deaths.</i> I will now state a general rule concerning all executions. We cannot derive the manner of execution from Scripture. Hence we need the tradition of our fathers.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">If we want to know how the death penalty is applied.</i> Scripture similarly does not state at what age one is obligated to observe the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">And is subject to the death penalty.</i>

Verse 10

[AND THE MAN THAT COMMITTETH ADULTERY WITH ANOTHER MAN’S WIFE.] Scripture next mentions, <i>and the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Shall be put to death.</i> for she was prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture earlier prohibited adultery (Lev. 18:20). However, Lev. 18:20 does not describe the punishment for this sin. Our verse does. The prohibition against adultery is not stated in our verse, for it was stated in Lev. 18:20.</i> The meaning of <i>even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife</i> is similar to <i>he hath cursed his father or his mother</i> (v. 9). It means he committed an evil act.
AND THE ADULTERESS. Women who are raped would not be so termed.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">A married woman who is raped is not executed, for a raped woman is not an adulteress.</i>

Verse 11

HE HATH UNCOVERED HIS FATHER’S NAKEDNESS. He has committed a great sin.

Verse 12

HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. <i>Kallato</i> means his daughter-in-law.
CORRUPTION. I have previously explained the meaning of <i>tevel</i> (corruption).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 18:23.</i>

Verse 13

BOTH OF THEM HAVE COMMITTED ABOMINATION. If the one who was penetrated was not raped.

Verse 14

AND IF A MAN TAKE WITH HIS WIFE ALSO HER MOTHER, IT IS WICKEDNESS. <i>Zimmah</i> (wickedness) means a promiscuous thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Such an act is the result of promiscuous thinking or planning. The word <i>zimmah</i> comes from the Hebrew root <i>zayin, mem, mem</i> which means to plan, devise, purpose. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
AND THEY. This one or that one. If the mother<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Of the woman with whom he had intercourse.</i> was his wife, then the daughter is burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">If the daughter of the woman with whom he had intercourse was his wife, then the mother is burned.</i> The same is true in the reverse.

Verse 15

AND YE SHALL SLAY THE BEAST. So that it not cause another to sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">If the animal had intercourse with a human being it might let another person approach it for sexual purposes.</i> Others say, to hide the shame.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">People looking at the animal will be reminded that a human being committed a sexual act with it. See Mishnah, <i>San.</i> 7:4, “Lest the beast should go through the market and people say, this is the beast by reason of which so and so was stoned.”</i>

Verse 16

AND LIE DOWN THERETO. <i>Le-rivah</i> (and lie down thereto) is an infinitive even though it is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-rivah</i> (and lie down thereto) is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> rather than with a <i>kamatz katan</i> (<i>le-rovah</i>). Compare, <i>le-korvah</i> (Ex. 36:2).</i> for the forms of the infinitive change. Compare, <i>be-shivri</i> (when I break) (Lev. 26:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-shivri</i> is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> rather than with a <i>kamatz katan</i> (<i>be-shovri</i>).</i>

Verse 17

AND IF A MAN SHALL TAKE HIS SISTER, HIS FATHER’S DAUGHTER. In a place where he is unknown and afterwards the facts become known.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">A person would not dare to marry a woman whom everyone knows to be his sister.</i> 
The meaning of <i>and see</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-ra’ah</i>.</i> <i>her nakedness</i> is, or see her nakedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Engage in intercourse outside of marriage (Krinsky). According to I.E. our verse is to be understood as follows: If a man marries his sister or has sexual intercourse with her outside of marriage.</i> It is like <i>he hath cursed his father or his mother</i> (v. 9).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-et immo</i> (literally, and his mother). Here the <i>vav</i> has the meaning of or. See I.E. on verse 9.</i> See means uncover. 
The meaning of <i>and she see his nakedness</i> is that they both agreed to this.
IT IS A SHAMEFUL THING. The word <i>chesed</i> (shameful thing) is related to <i>yechassedkha</i> (revile thee) in <i>Lest he that heareth revile thee</i> (Prov. 25:9). <i>Chesed hu</i> (it is a shameful thing) means it is an inflated act of harlotry.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chesed</i> usually has the meaning of an act of kindness, which is beyond the norm. Here it means an especially perverse evil act.</i>
HE HATH UNCOVERED HIS SISTER’S NAKEDNESS. Employing force.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Hence this additional clause.</i>
HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY. He alone shall bear his iniquity. The reason scripture mentions these things<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Marriage, consensual intercourse outside of marriage, and rape. It does not mention all three with regard to the other prohibited relations.</i> regarding the sister is that they grew up in one house and are young people who play. The brother is always alone with his sister. Scripture does not mention the punishment for intercourse with the daughter of one’s son or the daughter of one’s daughter, for it relied on the oral Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 51a.</i> It is possible that they are not mentioned because of the father’s lack of desire,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For his granddaughter.</i> for he is advanced in years when he has a mature daughter. It is for this reason that Scripture does not mention the mother of one’s father and the mother of one’s mother, for they are aged.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Hence their grandsons have no desire to have intercourse with them.</i>

Verse 18

SICKNESS. She is ill because of her blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">She is menstruating.</i> 
<i>And shall uncover her nakedness</i> means that he committed a great abomination. 
The meaning of <i>and she hath uncovered</i> is that she willingly uncovered, for if she was forced to have intercourse the man alone is cut off.

Verse 19

AND…THE NAKEDNESS OF THY MOTHER’S SISTER. Its meaning is, I have previously<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 18:12,13.</i> warned you not to uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">All the other verses open with, <i>And the man that… And if a man lie… And if a man take…</i> However, our verse reads, <i>And…the nakedness of thy mother’s sister…</i> Why the anomaly? Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Now the one who uncovers the nakedness<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Of his mother’s sister or his father’s sister.</i> has made naked his near kin.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>For he hath made naked his near kin</i> is another way of saying he has committed a heinous act. See I.E. on verse 9.</i>
THEY SHALL BEAR THEIR INIQUITY. If they willingly acted thus. Scripture does not mention the punishment for having intercourse with the sister of one’s father. It also does not even hint at the punishment for taking two sisters.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the one who marries his aunt, Scripture writes, <i>they shall hear their iniquity</i>. However, there is no mention of the punishment for marrying two sisters.</i> The intelligent will understand why.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">For Amram married the sister of his father and Jacob married two sisters (Krinsky; Weiser).</i> The words of tradition are also true.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis they shall be punished with <i>karet</i> (excision). See <i>Sifra</i> on the Torah portion <i>Tzav</i> 13:2.</i>

Verse 20

WITH HIS UNCLE’S WIFE. <i>Dodato</i> refers to his uncle’s wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The wife of his father’s brother. See Lev. 18:14.</i>
THEY SHALL DIE CHILDLESS. The Sadducees<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Anan and other Karaites (Krinsky). I.E. often refers to the Karaites by the term Sadducees.</i> say that <i>aririm</i> (childless) means naked and that the meaning of <i>yamutu</i> (they shall die) is, they shall be put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">They shall be executed naked.</i> They did not speak the truth. The correct interpretation is found in the words of the Aramaic translator,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>aririm yamutu</i>, they shall die childless.</i> for <i>aririm</i> is similar to <i>ariri</i> (childless) in <i>I go hence childless</i> (ariri) (Gen. 15:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>aririm</i> means childless.</i> I have previously explained <i>Write ye this man childless</i> (ariri) (Jer. 22:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">We do not have I.E.’s comment on Jeremiah.</i> 

Verse 21

[IT IS IMPURITY.] Scripture employs the term <i>niddah</i> (impurity) with regard to a brother’s wife. The meaning of <i>niddah hiy</i> (it is impurity)<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. renders <i>niddah hiy</i>, she is distanced. The term <i>niddah</i> usually refers to a menstruating women.</i> is, it is fitting for him to distance himself from her.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>niddah</i> comes from the root <i>nun, dalet, dalet</i>, which means to wander.</i> Similarly, <i>Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out</i> (menaddekhem)…<i>have said</i> (Is. 66:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>menaddekhem</i>, which is related to the word <i>niddah</i>, has the meaning of to distance.</i> Note, there is no mention of <i>niddah</i> in all of the prohibited sexual partners<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">None of the prohibited sexual partners is termed a <i>niddah</i>.</i> except with regard to a brother’s wife. A <i>niddah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">A menstruating woman.</i> is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 18,19.</i> However, a time comes when she is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Seven days after the start of her menstrual flow. See Lev. 15:19. It should be noted that today all women experiencing a menstrual flow are considered <i>zibbot</i>, and they immerse themselves seven days after the cessation of their menstrual flow, with 12 days being the minimum.</i> This possibility,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The possibility of permissibility.</i> as I will explain in the section <i>If brethren dwell together</i> (Deut. 25:5), also arises in the case of a brother’s wife. My reply to those who say,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Karaites.</i> as it is prohibited to marry the sister of the father (v. 19) so it is prohibited for a woman to marry her uncle<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites believe that it is prohibited for a woman to marry the brother of her father. They argue that there is no difference between a man taking his aunt, which is explicitly prohibited by Scripture (v. 19), and a woman marrying her uncle.</i> is: this is not the way of Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not legislate prohibitions of choosing sexual partners upon women, for it is the man who does the “taking” (Weiser). Or, the male plays the dominant role in the marriage. Thus it is proper to dominate a niece. However, it is unseemly for a nephew to dominate the sister of his father or his mother (Filwarg).</i> It is the males who are dominant<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 3:16, <i>And he</i> (your husband) <i>shall rule over thee</i>.</i> with regard to the prohibited sexual practices.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">It is the male who does the taking. If Scripture had wanted to prohibit a man from marrying the daughter of his brother it would have said so.</i> No one dominates the male.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">No female legally dominates a male.</i> Let those who accept the faulty logic of those who offer the above interpretation<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">That as it is prohibited to marry the sister of the father, so it is prohibited for a woman to marry her uncle.</i> show us why we should not accept the testimony of two women.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">If we argue that as males may not marry their aunts so nieces may not marry their uncles, then we are in effect saying that what applies to males also applies to females. Applying this logic we should argue that as males are fit to be witnesses so are females. However, the Karaites like the Rabbinites do not accept the testimony of women.</i> If they<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> argue from the laws of evaluation<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">That women are inferior to men and therefore cannot serve as witnesses. According to Lev. 27:3 a male’s valuation is 50 shekels and a female’s 30.</i> then four women should be equal to two male witnesses. We therefore need tradition.

Verse 22

YE SHALL THEREFORE KEEP ALL MY STATUTES. Not to violate the laws regarding these prohibited sexual practices.
AND ALL MINE ORDINANCES. The laws governing the punishment of those who engage in prohibited sexual practices.
[VOMIT YOU OUT.] I will explain this in the Torah portion <i>Va-Yelech</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 31:16 (Vol. 5, pp. 227,228).</i>

Verse 23

AND THEREFORE I ABHORRED THEM. This was stated metaphorically.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">According to medieval Jewish philosophy God does not have emotions. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Compare, <i>and His soul were grieved</i> (Jud. 10:16). 

Verse 24

The meaning of <i>a land flowing with milk and honey</i> (v. 24) is, there is no land like it.
WHO HAVE SET YOU APART FROM THE PEOPLES. With these statutes.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The statutes describing those with whom sexual relations are prohibited.</i> Furthermore, <i>Ye shall…separate between the clean beast…</i>(v. 25).<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Not only are you to be distinguished from people by your social codes, but you shall also be distinguished from them by observing dietary laws.</i> 

Verse 25

[THE CLEAN.] The ten mentioned beasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The ten clean beasts mentioned in Deut. 14:4,5.</i> All the others are unclean. 
<i>The unclean fowl</i> means the unclean fowl which are mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">In Lev. 11:13-20 and Deut. 14:12-18.</i> All others are clean. 
The meaning of <i>to hold unclean</i> is that you shall know in your mind and in your speech<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">When you speak about these animals it shall be clear that they are unclean.</i> that it is unclean. Similarly, <i>ye shall have in detestation among the fowls</i> (Lev. 11:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, the meaning of <i>ye shall have in detestation among the fowls</i> is, you shall know in your mind and in your speech that these fowl are unclean.</i> A resident alien<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">A non-Jew living in the Land of Israel.</i> shall therefore not eat that which is unclean in the clean land. He shall dwell in the land on this condition.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">This is the literal meaning of the verse according to I.E.

Verse 26

If you keep all that I command you, you will then be holy. You are obligated to follow Me,<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Follow My word. The literal translation is, walk after Me.</i> <i>for I the Lord am holy</i>.

Verse 27

[A MAN ALSO OR A WOMAN.] The reason Scripture states <i>A man also or a woman that divineth by a ghost or a familiar spirit, shall surely be put to death</i> is that the Torah earlier had said concerning ghosts and familiar spirits, <i>seek them not out to be defiled by them</i> (Lev. 19:31). Scripture now says, be holy and put to death the one who defiles himself with a ghost or a familiar spirit. Previously it did not mention the punishment for publicly turning to a ghost. Scripture mentions <i>woman</i>, for this art is mostly practiced by women. Similarly, <i>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</i> (Ex. 22:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture mention a sorceress because women practice sorcery more than men. See I.E. on Ex. 22:17 (Vol. 2, p. 487).</i>

Chapter 21



Verse 1

SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS. After charging the Israelites, and the sons of Aaron who are included among them, to be holy,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In chapters 18, 19, and 20.</i> the Lord told the sons of Aaron that they are commanded to keep themselves from other things, for they are the ministers of God. It is possible that <i>speak unto the priests</i> refers to the section which is mentioned above,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in the above-noted chapters.</i> for the Torah is in the hands of the <i>kohanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is the duty of the <i>kohanim</i> to teach these laws to the children of Israel. See Deut. 31:9; 17:8-13.</i>
AND SAY UNTO THEM. This refers to the commandments which they alone are obligated to keep.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The laws, which follow.</i>
FOR THE DEAD. <i>Le-nefesh</i> (for the dead) refers to the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>nefesh</i> usually refers to a living body.</i> 
The word <i>yittamma</i> (defile) is a <i>hitpa’el</i>. The <i>tet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>yittamma</i>.</i> receives a <i>dagesh</i> because the <i>tav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>the hitpa’el</i>.</i> is, swallowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">By the <i>tet</i>. In other words, the <i>dagesh</i> compensates for the missing <i>tav</i> of the <i>hitpae’el</i> form.</i> 
The meaning of <i>be-amav</i> (among his people) is among all of Israel, who are his people.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-amav</i> (among his people) literally means in his people. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 2

EXCEPT FOR HIS KIN. It had appeared to us that the meaning of <i>she’ero</i> (His kin) is similar to <i>she’er</i> (near of kin) in <i>None of you…to any that is near of kin to him</i> (Lev. 18:6). In other words, <i>she’ero</i> is a general term,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning a close relative.</i> with the details <i>for his mother, and for his father</i> following. 
The meaning of <i>ba’al be-amav</i> (a chief man among his people) (v. 4) is that a husband<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Who is a <i>kohen</i>.</i> shall not defile himself for his wife. However, since we saw that our teachers transmitted to us the law that a <i>kohen</i> is permitted to defile himself for his wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 22b.</i> the first interpretation falls away. They employed the word <i>she’er</i> as a support,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>She’ero</i> (his kin) literally means his flesh. According to the rabbis the reference is to a wife. The sages render <i>ki im le-she’ero</i> (except for his kin), except for his wife. According to I.E. the plain meaning of <i>she’ero</i> is not his wife. He believes that the rabbis used this verse as a support for a law which they knew by tradition.</i> as I explained in my comments on the phrase <i>unto a foreign people</i> (Ex. 21:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis <i>unto a foreign people</i> means to any stranger. According to I.E. this is not the literal meaning of this phrase. The rabbis merely used this verse as a support. See I.E. on Ex. 21:8 (Vol. 2, pp. 458,459).</i> The rabbis said that the meaning of <i>ba’al</i> is, a chief who rules over the people, as in <i>the owner thereof</i> (be-alav) <i>not being with it</i> (Ex. 22:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis the meaning of <i>lo yittamma ba’al be-amav</i> (He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people) is: “Seeing that he is fit to become the highest and most honored one among his people [i.e., a high priest], it (Scripture) warns him not to profane his distinction with the impurity of the dead” (Nachmanides, Chavel translation).</i> The reason Scripture mentions the mother of the <i>kohen</i> before the father is that in most cases the male lives longer than the female.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In most cases the <i>kohen</i> will mourn for his mother before he does so for his father. Hence she is mentioned first.</i>

Verse 3

THAT IS NEAR UNTO HIM. In that she is his sister from his father and his mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>That is near</i> indicates that the sister spoken of is a full sister.</i> Now, aside from those mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 2 and 3.</i> a chief (v. 4) shall not defile himself for any of his people, be they <i>kohanim</i> or Israelites.

Verse 4

TO PROFANE HIMSELF. The <i>lamed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>le-hechallo</i>.</i> has a <i>dagesh</i> in it to compensate for the missing other <i>lamed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hechallo</i> is spelled with one <i>lamed</i>. However, it comes from a root that has two <i>lameds</i>. The <i>dagesh</i> in <i>hechallo</i> compensates for the missing root letter.</i> <i>Le-hechallo</i> (to profane himself) is an infinitive in the <i>nifal</i>.

Verse 5

THEY SHALL NOT MAKE BALDNESS UPON THEIR HEAD. Over the dead.
THE CORNERS OF THEIR BEARD. Over the dead, as is the practice in places in the land of the Chaldeans. The meaning of the <i>corners of thy beard</i> (Lev. 19:27) is thus clarified.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It too refers to an act of mourning. See I.E. on Lev. 19:27.</i> 
<i>Saratet</i> (cuttings) means even one cut.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Saratet</i> (cuttings) is singular.

See Lev. 19:27,28.</i> The reason Scripture warns the <i>kohanim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">After already having told the Israelites.</i> about this is that one who has a bald head, or whose beard has been shorn, or whose flesh is cut shall not serve before the Lord.

Verse 6

AND NOT PROFANE THE NAME OF GOD. The reason being, for <i>the offerings made by fire…they do offer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>For the offerings made by fire…they do offer</i> refers to <i>and not profane the name of God</i>, not to <i>They shall be holy unto their God</i>.</i>

Verse 7

WOMAN THAT IS A HARLOT. If we follow the plain meaning of the text then we do not find in all of Scripture the word <i>zonah</i> (harlot) to have any but its literal meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a <i>zonah</i> is a woman who sells her body. According to the rabbis a <i>zonah</i> is a woman who had intercourse with an individual whom she is not permitted to marry, i.e., a woman who has relations with a close relative or with a non-Jew. Such a woman is considered a <i>zonah</i> even if the intercourse was not with her consent. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The meaning of and <i>have given a boy for a harlot</i> (zonah) (Joel 4:3) is also as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>zonah</i> in Joel 4:3 refers to a harlot. It means that they gave a young man in payment for sexual favors.</i>
OR PROFANED. A woman who is not known as a harlot.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">A woman who is not a harlot but has been defiled. I.E. does not define how the woman was profaned. However, from the context it appears that I.E. refers to a woman who is not a prostitute but had intercourse with someone who is not a <i>kohen</i>. It is also possible that I.E. refers to a woman who is promiscuous but not a prostitute. It should be noted that according to the rabbis the reference is to a woman born of a marriage between a <i>kohen</i> and a woman prohibited to him (<i>Kiddushin</i> 77a).</i> According to the plain meaning, it would appear from the words of Ezekiel<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 44:22.</i> that the widow of a <i>kohen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">That is, only the widow of a <i>kohen</i>.</i> is permitted to marry other <i>kohanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 44:22 seems to imply that the only widow a <i>kohen</i> may marry is the widow of another <i>kohen</i>, for Ezekiel states, <i>Neither shall they take for their wives a widow…but they shall take…a widow that is the widow of a priest</i>.</i> The words of tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">To the effect that a <i>kohen</i> may marry any widow.

We thus must interpret Ezek. 44:22 as follows: Neither shall a <i>kohen gadol</i> take for their wives a widow…but some of the <i>kohanim</i>, that is, a common <i>kohen</i>, may take a widow (any widow, not only the widow of a <i>kohen</i>). See <i>Kiddushin</i> 78b.</i>

Verse 9

IF SHE PROFANE HERSELF BY PLAYING THE HARLOT. Many believe that <i>techel</i> (profane) is related to <i>techillah</i> (beginning).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation renders <i>ki techel li-zenot</i> (if she profane herself by playing the harlot) as if she begins to play the harlot.</i> However, I believe that it is related to the word <i>chillul</i> (profane) but it is a <i>hifil</i>. Compare, <i>he shall not break</i> (yachel)<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Or profane.</i> <i>his word</i> (Num. 30:3).

Compare, <i>achel</i> (I will begin), <i>tachel</i> (she will begin), etc.</i> It is possible that the word <i>hechel</i> (profaned) (Ezek. 20:9) and the word <i>techel</i> are both irregular in that the <i>tav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tav</i> of <i>techel</i></i> is vocalized with a <i>tzereh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a small <i>kamatz</i>.</i> so that it not is confused in meaning with <i>techillah</i> (beginning).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Beginning and profane both come from the same root, <i>chet, lamed, lamed</i>.

Verse 11

NEITHER SHALL HE GO IN TO ANY DEAD BODY. <i>Nafshot met</i> is to be read as if written <i>nafshot guf met</i> (dead body). The word <i>guf</i> (body)<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Guf</i> is masculine.</i> is missing, for <i>met</i> (dead) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Modifying <i>guf.

The meaning of <i>he shall</i> [not] <i>go in</i> is, he shall not go into a tent or a house where the dead body is located. 
The meaning of <i>for his father, or his mother</i> is, for his father and mother, whom he is obligated to respect while they live and after their death. The <i>kohen gadol</i> may certainly not defile himself over his brother or his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse only mentions the <i>kohen gadol</i>’s father and mother.

NEITHER SHALL HE GO OUT OF THE SANCTUARY. After the dead, so said the transmitters of tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>San.</i> 18a. Also see Rashi.</i> What they said is correct. Some say that the reference is to the seven days of consecration. However, this cannot be so, for Scripture has already stated, <i>and</i> [the kohen] <i>that is consecrated</i> (v. 10).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our verse speaks of a <i>kohen</i> who is already consecrated.</i> It is also possible that the meaning of our verse is that the <i>kohen gadol</i> shall not go out of the sanctuary except for the purpose of observing a precept.

Verse 13

IN HER VIRGINITY. There are nouns in Hebrew that never come in the singular. Compare, <i>ne’urim</i> (youth), <i>zekunim</i> (old age), <i>alumim</i> (youth), and <i>betulim</i> (virginity). There are other words which never come in the plural, i.e., <i>taf</i> (children), <i>shekhem</i> (shoulder), <i>zahav</i> (gold), and <i>barzel</i> (iron).

Verse 14

A WIDOW, OR ONE DIVORCED. Any woman widowed or divorced from a <i>kohen</i> or an Israelite.

Verse 15

Verse 16



Verse 17

THE BREAD OF HIS GOD. The reference is to the sacrifices offered on the altar. The <i>kohanim</i> spoken of in our verse refer to common priests. Scripture therefore states anyone who is of the seed of Aaron the <i>kohen</i>.

Verse 18

MAIMED. <i>Charum</i> (maimed) is the reverse of <i>saru’a</i> (too long). Note, <i>charum</i> is related to the word <i>cherem</i> (destruction).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>saru’a</i> refers to a person who has an extra-large limb while <i>charum</i> refers to a person who has a limb that is undersized.</i>

Verse 19



Verse 20

OR CROOK-BACKED. The word <i>gibben</i> (crook-backed) is most probably related to the word <i>gavnunnim</i> (peaks) in <i>ye mountains of peaks</i> (Ps. 68:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>gibben</i> is someone who is extremely tall.</i> The <i>nun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>gibben</i>.</i> is a root letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Hence we can relate <i>gibben</i> (crook-backed) to <i>gavnunnim</i> (peaks).</i> <i>Gibben</i> is an adjective.

HATH HIS EYE OVERSPREAD.

STONES. <i>Ashekh</i> (stones) refers to the testicle. After listing specific blemishes the Torah issues a general statement and says, <i>no man…that hath a blemish</i> (v. 21).

The meaning of <i>hath a blemish</i> is similar to <i>he hath cursed his father or his mother</i> (Lev. 20:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The repetition is for emphasis. See I.E. on Lev. 20:9.</i>

Verse 22

THE BREAD OF HIS GOD…OF THE MOST HOLY. The showbread, the guilt offering, and the sin offering, which in comparison to the peace offerings are most holy, for the peace offerings are also holy.

Chapter 22



Verse 1



Verse 2

THAT THEY SEPARATE THEMSELVES. <i>Ve-yinnazeru</i> (that they separate themselves) is similar to <i>ve-hizzhartem</i> (thus shall ye separate) (Lev. 15:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Both words come from the root <i>nun, zayin, resh</i>.</i> <i>Ve-yinnazeru</i> is a <i>nifal</i>.

AND THAT THEY PROFANE NOT. <i>And that they profane not</i> applies to what immediately follows it and to what follows later. Our verse is to be read as follows: And that they profane not My holy name, and that they profane not that which they hallow unto Me. 
The meaning of <i>I am the Lord</i> is, I the Lord am holy.

Verse 3

[FROM BEFORE ME: I AM THE LORD.] This means since he is cut off from God, he will cease to exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">God is the cause and sustainer of existence.

Verse 6



Verse 7

AND WHEN THE SUN IS DOWN, HE SHALL BE CLEAN. It is known that <i>he shall be clean</i> refers to the unclean, for there is no mention of the word day in the verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>ve-taher</i> (and he shall be clean) cannot refer to the day.</i> Compare, <i>and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean</i> (Lev. 12:8).

Verse 8

Those whose brains are empty explain the verse in Ezekiel, which reads, <i>The priests shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be fowl or beast</i> (Ezek. 44:31), as meaning that the priests shall not eat anything brought down or torn by animals or fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 22:30 prohibits an Israelite from eating that which is torn (<i>terefah</i>). Deut. 44:21 prohibits an Israelite from eating meat which dies of itself (<i>nevelah</i>). Ezek 44:21 seems to limit the prohibition to eat <i>nevalah</i> and <i>terefah</i> only to <i>kohanim</i>. In order to harmonize Ezekiel and the Torah, there were those who claimed that Ezekiel spoke of an animal that has been properly slaughtered and then ripped apart and befouled by birds and beasts. In other words, the Torah prohibits any Israelite from eating the meat of any animal that has been ripped apart by an animal of prey, while Ezekiel adds that a <i>kohen</i> is also prohibited from eating kosher meat that has been befouled. It should be noted that according to this interpretation the word <i>nevelah</i> is not to be taken literally but means flesh which is as disgusting as meat that dies of itself (Filwarg). For other interpretations see Sarim and Meijler.</i> However, this is nonsense, for the Torah states all that dies of itself or is torn he<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohen</i>.</i> shall not eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of verse 8, which literally reads: that which dies of itself, or is torn, he shall not eat.</i> The meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Of verse 8 and Ezek. 44:21.</i> is if he eats<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">That which dies of itself or is torn.</i> he shall not minister.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of our verse and that of Ezekiel is, if a <i>kohen</i> eats that which was torn or died of itself he is ritually unclean and shall not serve in the tabernacle or eat sacred food.</i>

Verse 9

THEY SHALL THEREFORE KEEP MY CHARGE. <i>Mishmarti</i> (my charge) alludes to the sanctuary. Scripture therefore reads, <i>lest they bear sin for it</i> (alav), <i>and die therein</i> (vo).

Verse 10

THERE SHALL NO COMMON MAN. One who is not of the seed of Aaron.

Verse 11

THEY MAY EAT OF HIS BREAD. Males and females.

THAT WHICH IS SET APART FROM THE HOLY THINGS. The thigh and the breast (Lev. 10:15).

Verse 13

SHE MAY EAT OF HER FATHER’S BREAD. As at first.
BUT THERE SHALL NO COMMON MAN EAT OF IT. The reference is to a son, if she has one. She cannot eat of the holy food because of her son.

Hence this interpretation.</i> On the other hand, <i>and shall give unto the priest</i> might apply to what precedes it and to what follows it. Our verse is to be interpreted as follows: Then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it and shall give it unto the priest, and he shall give unto the priest the holy thing.

BLIND. <i>Avveret</i> (blind) is an adjective relating to the eye.

Verse 29

[AND WHEN YE SACRIFICE A SACRIFICE OF THANKSGIVING.] The reason that <i>And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving…On the same day it shall he eaten</i> follows is that Scripture earlier noted it is prohibited to kill a cow or a ewe [and its young together] in one day.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The law codified in our verse and the law dealt with in the previous verse both deal with “one day.”</i> Scripture adds to what is written in the Torah portion <i>Tzav</i> (Lev. 6:2),<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding a sacrifice of thanksgiving.</i> <i>that ye may be accepted</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Hence verses 29 and 30 are not redundant.</i>

Verse 1



Verse 2

[EVEN THESE ARE MY APPOINTED SEASONS.] Scripture reads, <i>even these are My appointed seasons</i> (mo’adai) because there are many Sabbaths in the year.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. verse 2 refers only to the Sabbath. That being the case, the verse should have read this is My appointed season. I.E. thus points out that <i>My appointed seasons</i> refers to all the Sabbaths (of the year. After stating that all the Sabbaths are God’s appointed seasons, Scripture goes on to speak of the weekly Sabbath in verse 3. For another interpretation see Rashi.</i>

Verse 3

IN ALL YOUR DWELLINGS. In your country and outside of your country, at home and on the way.
I have previously explained the meaning of <i>it is a sabbath unto the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 16:23 (Vol. 2, p. 325). It is called “<i>a sabbath day unto the Lord</i>…because He rested from all His work on the seventh day.”</i> 

Verse 4

Scripture then mentions the festivals (v. 4). The Torah says, <i>even these are My appointed seasons</i>, with regard to the Sabbath and <i>in their appointed season</i> with regard to the festivals. The meaning of <i>in their appointed season</i> is, in any day of the week in which they fall. Note, I will now lay down a general rule with regard to the festivals. During the time of the Temple the festivals were in the hands of the Beth Din. Do you not see that Scripture says, <i>For the king had taken counsel</i> (II Chron. 30:2), with regard to the Passover proclaimed by Hezekiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hezekiah put off the observance of Passover for a month. According to I.E., Hezekiah’s actions were based on a ruling of the Bet Din. See Vol. 1, pp. 9,10.</i> After Hezekiah established the new moon of Nisan he proclaimed a leap year.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And proclaimed that Passover be observed in the next month.</i> Our sages, of blessed memory, criticized him for this, for he should not have added a Nisan on Nisan.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>See Berakhot</i> 10b.</i> The transmitters of tradition said that the Beth Din took many things into consideration in estabhshing the year.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 11a,b. The Bet Din had to consider many things in deciding whether or not to make a year a leap year.</i> They said, regarding Rabbi Akiba, that he established two leap years back to back according to the needs of the hour.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>San.</i> 12a. However, the text there speaks of three years. Hence Krinsky suggests emending I.E. to read three years. <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 omits the word two. It reads, “He established leap years back to back.”</i> There is no proof in Scripture as to how Israel established the months and the festivals. The Gaon’s statement to the effect that they relied on the intercalational calculation<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The rules governing the establishment of the fixed Jewish calendar.</i> is not true, for there are proofs in the Mishnah and also in the Talmud that Passover fell on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Which cannot occur under the rules of the fixed Jewish calendar.</i> There are also two stories in the Talmud [which show that they did not rely on a fixed calendar].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah, <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 2:9 records a controversy between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua as to when Yom Kippur fell in a certain year. If the rabbis of the Mishnah had used a fixed calendar there would be no place for this difference of opinion. The Mishnah (<i>Ibid.</i> 2:8) also reports an instance of two sets of witnesses contradicting themselves as to the position of the new moon. The latter shows that the month was established by actually seeing the new moon and not by calculation. See Weiser and Krinsky.</i> Leap years<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Of which there are seven in an 19 year cycle.</i> come close to compensating for the additional days which a solar year has over a lunar year.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The solar year is about ten days longer than the lunar year.

What follows is a bit complicated. Hence a few words are in order. The Jewish months begin with the conjunction of the sun and moon. The calculation starts with the very first conjunction. That conjunction theoretically occurred at the end of five hours and 204 parts of an hour of the second day of the week (the rabbis divided an hour into 1,080 parts). The latter is known as <i>molad tohu</i>, or <i>molad baharad</i>, which is the Hebrew abbreviation for five hours and 204 parts of an hour of the second day of the week. How do we arrive at this calculation? Ibn Ezra explains that we do so by counting back a year from the conjunction which occurred on the day that Adam was born. It should be noted that that year, except for the five days preceding the birth of Adam, did not exist in reality. It was a theoretical year.</i> starts with the end of 14 hours of the sixth day;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Adam was born on Friday. That day was the first day of the month of Tishri. According to the rabbis the moon was then in conjunction with the sun at the end of 14 hours of the day.</i> that is, add four days, eight hours, and 876 parts<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The days between the start of one simple lunar year to the next lunar year. See Maimonides, <i>M.T., Laws of the Sanctification of the New Moon</i>, 6:4,5.</i> to five hours and 204 parts of an hour of the second day of the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">There were five days preceding the birth of Adam. Those days belonged to the previous year. In that year the conjunction of the sun and the moon (had they existed) would have taken place at five hours plus 204 parts of on hour of the second day. The calculation is as follows. A lunar month consists of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 3 1/3 seconds. A year consists of 12 months. If we work backwards from the birth of Adam, who was born on a Friday, a day which we mark as the New Year, then the previous New Year which came 12 months earlier had to fall on a Monday. For 12 times 29 1/2 days and 44 minutes comes to 50 weeks plus four days and some five hours.</i> Then the birth of the new moon will occur at the end of 14 hours of the sixth day.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Adam was born on a Friday.

I.E.’s point is that our calendar is accurate. It is based on a 19-year cycle. The 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th year of the cycle are leap years. In those years we add a second month of Adar. According to current calculations the first leap year occurred a year after Adam was born (the third year from creation). If we begin the calendar two years before Adam was born, our calendar would have to be accordingly readjusted. However, we cannot do so, for there was nothing in existence two years before Adam’s birth. Hence the calendar must begin a year before the birth of Adam, not before.</i> for it did not yet exist.

See I.E., <i>Sefer Ha-Ibbur</i>, pp. 11,12.</i> due to the “postponements.” For in a year when the birth of the new moon<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Of Tishri.</i> occurs at nine hours and 204 parts of the hour on the third day of the week, they should fast on what is the eighth day of the month according to our calculation if they rely on the conjunction.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">For in this instance the first day of the month falls two days after the birth of the new moon.

Josh. 5:11 relates: <i>And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day</i>. This scholar believed that the term <i>“passover”</i> in Josh. 5:11 refers to the 15th of Nisan. Hence <i>the morrow after the passover</i> refers to the 16th. This scholar also assumed that the <i>unleavened cakes and parched corn</i> came from the new produce. Now, since eating of new produce is forbidden till the <i>omer</i> is offered, and Scripture tells us, <i>And they did eat of the produce of the land</i>, we must assume that the eating of the new grain was preceded by the offering of the <i>omer</i>. We thus see that the <i>omer</i> is brought on the 16th of Nisan. Furthermore, Josh. 5:11 shows that <i>on the morrow after the sabbath</i> means on the morrow following the first day of the festival.</i> He did not know that it cost him his life,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">This is metaphorical. That is, he trapped himself. See Prov. 7:23, <i>As a bird hasteneth to the snare–And knoweth not that it is at the cost of his life</i>. The “proof” offered by this scholar does not prove that which he intended. In fact, the Karaites or Sadducees can, as we shall see below, use his interpretation for their own purposes.</i> for the Passover falls on the 14th<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Of Nisan.</i> and the morrow following it is on the 15th.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Day of Nisan. I.E.’s point is that in Scripture the term Passover is limited to the 14th of Nisan when the Passover sacrifice was offered. The seven days following are referred to as the Festival of Unleavened Bread (<i>chag ha-matzot</i>). Thus if we interpret Joshua 5:11 as alluding to the bringing of the <i>omer</i>, then we have to assume that the <i>omer</i> was brought on the 15th of Nisan, which we today call the first day of Passover. This is not in keeping with Rabbinic tradition. On the contrary, it supports the Karaites, for they believe that the <i>morrow after the sabbath</i> in Leviticus 23:16 refers to the first Sunday following the start of Passover. In other words, the Karaites say that in the year that Israel celebrated the first Passover in Canaan, the 15th of Nisan fell on a Sunday and Israel therefore offered the <i>omer</i> on that day.</i> Scripture similarly reads, <i>And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month</i> (Num. 33:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The complete clause reads: <i>And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first of the first month; on the morrow after the passover</i>. We thus clearly see that <i>on the morrow after the passover</i> refers to the 15th of Nisan.</i> The eating of parched corn is prohibited until the waving of the <i>omer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Josh. 5:11 cannot refer to the new grain.</i> The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon interprets <i>And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn</i> as follows: And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the Passover of the Lord, i.e., the morrow following the 15th day.</i> says that there are two Passovers, a Passover of the Lord and a Passover of Israel. The Passover of God is on the night of the 15th.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">While the Passover of Israel is on the 14th. The Passover of the Lord falls on the 15th, for that is when God killed the first-born of Egypt. The Passover of Israel falls on the 14th because that is the day that Israel sacrifices the paschal lamb.</i> Now, the <i>day after the Passover</i> in Joshua refers to the 16th day.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Of Nisan.</i> It follows from this that the interpretation of <i>on the morrow after the passover</i> (Num. 33:3), is on the morrow following the sacrifice of the Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The paschal lamb.</i> What he said has no value. The festival<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The 14th of Nisan.</i> is called Passover only because God skipped over the houses.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Israelites. Thus the term Passover cannot be applied to first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread (<i>chag ha-matzot</i>). Hence the term Passover in Josh. 5:11 cannot refer to the 15th of Nisan.</i> Its morrow is the morning of the 15th.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Not the morning of the 16th.</i> Scripture similarly writes, <i>all that day, and all the night, and all the next day</i> (yom ha-mochorat)<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the day of the morning. The point is that <i>mochorat</i> (morrow) refers to the following morning.</i> (Num. 11:32). The Gaon further states that the unleavened cakes and the parched corn were from the old grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">From the grain of the previous year. In this case Josh. 5:11 is to be interpreted literally and it presents no problem, for it merely states that Israel ate unleavened cakes and the parched corn from the old grain on the 15th of Nisan (<i>on the morrow after the passover</i>).</i> This is not far-fetched, for Scripture says that the waving of the <i>omer</i> should begin <i>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn</i> (Deut. 16:9). If the <i>omer</i> was waved on the 15th<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Of Nisan</i> when did they harvest and make unleavened bread?<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>omer</i> was waved on the 15th of Nisan when Israel entered the Land of Israel as the Karaites maintain, when did they harvest the grain to make the unleavened bread?

It is possible that the term <i>avur</i> refers to the produce of the year that has passed.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The verb <i>avar</i> means passed. Hence this interpretation.</i> The meaning of <i>the produce of the land</i> is the produce of the land of Sihon and Og.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Which are located in Transjordan. The Israelites brought grain from Transjordan when they entered Canaan.</i> The fact that Scripture afterwards states, <i>of the fruit of the land of Canaan</i> (Josh. 5:12), is proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 5:12 states, <i>but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year</i>. This implies that Josh. 5:11 refers to grain that was not from the land of Canaan.</i> Furthermore, <i>kaluy</i> (parched corn) (Josh. 5:11) is not the same as <i>kali</i> (parched com) (Lev. 23:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kali</i> (Lev.23:14) refers to parched corn from the new produce. <i>Kaluy</i> (Josh. 5:11) refers to any parched corn.</i> Now, Scripture says, <i>And ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corn</i> (kali), <i>nor fresh ears</i> (v. 14). The verse which reads <i>kaluy ba-esh</i> (parched with fire) (Lev. 2:14)<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 2:14 speaks of a meal offering of first-fruits (<i>bikkurim</i>).</i> cannot serve as an argument to the contrary,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>kaluy</i> refers to the new grain.</i> for it describes the act<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">It is an adjective.</i> since corn in the ear parched in fire is called <i>kaluy</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 2:14 speaks of grain parched in fire.

I.E.’s point is that Josh. 5:11 does not state, <i>And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn</i>, to inform us that they waved the <i>omer</i> and then ate matzot and grain from the new produce. It rather tells us, <i>And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn</i>, because the manna ceased.</i> The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> further says: If the word Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>on the morrow after the sabbath</i>.</i> is to be taken literally<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">As the Karaites do.</i> then from which Sabbath shall we start to count? Joshua<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">A Karaite scholar.</i> answers that there are 18 days aside from the Sabbath whereon sacrifices are offered. These days are called <i>mo’adim</i> (festivals). Now, since there is a sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">A special sacrifice.</i> on the day that the <i>omer</i> is offered<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">And Scripture does not specify that day as a separate festival.</i> it is a sign and a witness that the waving takes place on one of the days of the spring festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">One of the days of Passover.

Hence if we reject the Rabbinic tradition and take the word Sabbath literally, we do not know from which Sabbath to start the count of seven weeks.</i> Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>After this manner ye shall offer daily</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">On the Festival of Unleavened Bread.</i> <i>for seven days</i> (Num. 28:24).

It does not start on a Sunday.</i> Look, I will hint at a secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the festival of Shavu’ot. The secret is what follows: All the festivals are contingent on a specific day of the month. Scripture does not give a specific date of the month for the festival of shavu’ot (so Weiser). The question arises, what sort of secret is this? This is obvious. It is possible that I.E. is hinting that the establishment of the observance of Shavu’ot 50 days from the second day of Passover is not of Pentateuchal origin. The Torah states that the counting of the seven weeks starts from the day <i>of putting the sickle to the corn</i>. It does not date when the counting is to begin. See Judah Ha-Levi, <i>The Book of Kuzari</i> 3:41, “…The Synhedrion and all the sages found that this period [of 50 days] was fixed with the intention to create an interval of fifty days between ‘the first fruits of harvest of the barley and the harvest of wheat,’ and to observe ‘seven weeks,’ which are seven complete Sabbaths.’ The first day of the week [<i>the morrow after the Sabbath</i> ] is only mentioned for argument’s sake in the following manner: should the day of putting ‘the sickle to the corn’ be on a Sunday, you count till Sunday…The date of putting of the sickle from which we count is left for us to fix” (<i>The Book of Kuzari</i>, translated by H. Hirschfeld, N.Y., 1946, p. 153).</i> All the festivals are contingent on a specific day of the month. Scripture does not give a date for the festival of Shavu’ot<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">It does not state on which day of the month Shavu’ot falls.</i> because of the counting, which is a commandment. The rabbis, of blessed memory, transmitted the tradition that the Torah was given on the festival of Shavu’ot and that it is concerning this day that Scripture states, <i>for we must hold a feast unto the Lord</i> (Ex. 10:9). 
Some say that whenever the Torah uses the term <i>li-retzonekhem</i> it means to be accepted from you,<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">That is, so that God will accept it from you.</i> for Scripture reads, <i>And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you</i> (li-retzonekhem) (v. 11). The meaning of the aforementioned is that you shall wave it willingly.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>li-retzonkhem</i> means willingly.</i> This means you shall offer a he-lamb<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Along with the sheaf. This seems to contradict what came before, for up to now <i>li-retzonkhem</i> was interpreted as meaning to be accepted for you. Filwarg suggests emending “the meaning of the aforementioned is <span class="underline">not</span> that you shall wave it willingly.” Meijler suggests the following: However, the meaning of the aforementioned is that you shall wave it willingly; in other words, our sentence introduces a new interpretation.</i> of the first year so that you will be accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">According to Meijler it means you shall offer a he-lamb willingly so that you will be accepted.</i> 

Verse 12

Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that <i>ben shanah</i> (of the first year) (Ex. 12:5) does not have the same meaning as <i>ben shenato</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, of his first year.</i> (of the first year), for <i>ben shanato</i> refers to a lamb under a year and <i>ben shanah</i> refers to a lamb of a complete year. Note, they did not read the section dealing with the dedication of the altar. The latter reads, <i>one he-lamb of the first year</i> (ben shenato), for a burnt offering (Num. 7:15). However, in the final section<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Which summarizes the number of sacrifices offered when the altar was dedicated.</i> it reads, <i>the he-lambs of the first year</i> (bene shanah) <i>twelve</i> (Num. 7:87).<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Scripture refers to the same lamb by either phrase.

Verse 15

If it were not for tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">That requires us to count the days between the waving of the <i>omer</i> and Shavu’ot.</i> it would have appeared that the counting of the days is similar to the counting of the years<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ki-shenot</i>.

The ritual is to be performed on the eighth day (Motot). According to Filwarg, I.E.’s point is that the Torah tells us to count seven weeks and to offer the sacrifice on the 50<sup>th</sup> day. Similarly, when Scripture requires seven days to pass (as in the case of one experiencing an issue, or a Nazirite who defiled himself) and then to offer a sacrifice, it means count seven days and offer the sacrifice on the eighth day.</i>

Verse 19

Now, since the slaughtering of the peace offerings took place on the festival of Shavu’ot and it is a day of holy assembly, it is thus permissible to slaughter<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">An animal for meat.</i> on all the festivals.

[SPOKE.] The reason the statement <i>And the Lord spoke</i> precedes the law dealing with the day of the sounding of the <i>shofar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Which it does not do with regard to the festival of Shavu’ot.</i> is that the latter is a festival unto itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">The laws dealing with the festival of Rosh Ha-Shanah opens with <i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying</i>.

Verse 24

IN THE SEVENTH MONTH. We begin the count of months from Nisan,<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 12:2.</i> for we then left Egypt.

Verse 27

[HOWBEIT.] Scripture reads, <i>Howbeit on the tenth day</i>, because a day of solemn assembly (v. 24) is a joyful day.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">This verse refers to Rosh Ha-Shanah. We thus see that a <i>day of holy convocation</i> is a joyful day.</i> The Book of Ezra similarly reads, <i>Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet</i> (Neh. 8:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">This verse occurred on Rosh Ha-Shanah. However (<i>Howbeit</i>), Yom Kippur does not have these characteristics. I.E. considered Ezra and Nehemia one book.</i>
AND YE SHALL AFFLICT. I have previously explained the meaning of afflict.<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 16:29.</i>

Verse 28

TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOU. Its meaning is, it is a day of atonement for you alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">It is a day of atonement for Israel alone.</i>

Verse 29

FOR WHATSOEVER SOUL IT SHALL BE THAT SHALL NOT BE AFFLICTED. <i>Te’unneh</i> (be afflicted) is a <i>pu’al</i>. This<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">The use of the <i>pu’al te’unneh</i> (be afflicted).</i> is a sign that if we know of a person who does not observe this precept as we observe it, then we shall force that individual to fast.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be afflicted</i> implies that one is forced to fast.</i> The reason Scripture says that <i>no</i> manner of work is to be done on Yom Kippur is so that people will not be engaged in anything but seeking atonement for sins.

Verse 30

THAT SOUL WILL I DESTROY. There is a difference between “destroy” and “cut off” (v. 29). I cannot explain the difference.<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">I am not permitted to explain. According to I.E. “cut off” means death either by execution or by the hand of God (see I.E. on Lev. 18:29). In Ps. 1:6 he explains that “destruction” refers to the obliteration of the soul following death. “I cannot explain” might mean that I.E. cannot explain how the soul is destroyed.</i> 

Verse 31

[NO MANNER OF WORK.] Scripture repeats, <i>Ye shall do no manner of work</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition to do work on Yom Kippur was previously stated in verse 28.</i> in order to add, <i>it is a statue for ever throughout your generations</i>.

Verse 32

Verse 36

SEVEN DAYS YE SHALL BRING AN OFFERING MADE BY FIRE. Even though it is not the same as the <i>offering made by fire</i> that is brought on Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah tells us that on Passover and Sukkot the Jews are to bring an <i>offering made by fire</i>. However, there is a difference in the sacrifices offered on Passover and Sukkot. Thus <i>an offering made by fire</i> does not refer to a specific sacrifice.</i>
IT IS A DAY OF SOLEMN ASSEMBLY. Some say that <i>atzeret</i> (solemn assembly) means an assembly as in <i>azteret bogedim</i> (an assembly of treacherous men) (Jer. 9:1). <i>Azteret</i> refers to the gathering of all of Israel on the three pilgrimage festivals. However, they did not speak correctly, for look, Scripture states with regard to Passover, <i>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly</i> (atzeret) (Deut. 16:8). However, it also states <i>and thou shalt turn in the morning</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">On the second day of Passsover. See I.E. on Deut. 16:7 (Vol. 5, p. 112).</i> <i>and go unto thy tents</i> (Deut. 16:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">There was thus no gathering of all Israel on the seventh day of Passover. Yet the Torah refers to this day as an <i>atzeret</i>.</i> It appears that <i>atzeret</i> is similar to <i>netzar</i> (detained)<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Or held back. From the root <i>ayin, tzadi, resh</i>.</i> in <i>detained before the Lord</i> (I Sam. 21:8). <i>Atzeret</i> means that the Israelite shall not be involved in any worldly affairs.<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelite shall hold himself back from doing work.</i> The meaning of <i>atzeret</i> is, <i>ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</i> explains the term <i>atzeret</i>.</i> Scripture writes similarly with regard to the <i>atzeret</i> of the festival of Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 16:8 reads: “And on the seventh day [of Passover] shall be an <i>azeret</i>…thou shall do no work therein.”</i>

Verse 37

THESE ARE THE APPOINTED SEASONS OF THE LORD. Whereon you are obligated to bring an offering made by fire. Scripture explains<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Scripture now explains.</i> that on all of these festivals a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">The festival offerings.</i> and libations are to be brought, for until now Scripture only mentioned an offering made by fire, and it is possible that an offering made by fire refers only to a burnt offering or only to a meal offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Hence our verse explains that the term burnt offering refers to an offering made by fire.</i>

Verse 38

AND BESIDE YOUR GIFTS. On the three pilgrimage festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 16:17.</i> Similarly, And the vows of the congregation and of the individual and their freewill offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">Which people were wont to bring when they came to God’s house on the festivals.</i>

Verse 39

[HOWBEIT.] Scripture reads <i>howbeit</i> because it mentioned the affliction of the soul in the preceding section. The Torah prohibited fasting on the festival of Sukkot, for Scripture reads with regard to this festival, <i>And thou shalt rejoice</i> (Deut. 16:14)…<i>and thou shalt be altogether joyful</i> (Deut. 16:15).
WHEN YE HAVE GATHERED IN THE FRUITS OF THE LAND. From the fields and vineyards.
YE SHALL KEEP THE FEAST. <i>Tachoggu</i> (ye shall keep the feast) comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>chet, gimel, gimel</i>.</i> The reference is to the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">The peace offerings.</i>
ON THE FIRST DAY SHALL BE A SOLEMN REST.<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, On the first day a solemn rest.</i> <i>Shabbaton</i> (a solemn rest) is a noun. The words “shall be unto you” are missing.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>On the first day a solemn rest</i> should be read as if written: On the first day shall be a solemn rest unto you.</i> If <i>shabbaton</i> were an adjective, the word <i>yom</i> (day) would have a <i>heh</i> rather than a <i>bet</i> prefixed to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>be yom ha-rishon shabbaton</i> (on the first day…a solemn rest). If <i>shabbaton</i> were an adjective, then our verse would read <i>ha-yom ha-rishon shabbaton</i> (the first day a solemn rest).</i>

Verse 40

The reference is to the magnates of the land who are the great ones of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 23:44.</i> Some say that <i>Whosoever curseth his God</i> (v. 15) means whosoever curseth his God in secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For our verse does not specify the punishment of the one who curses God.</i> The correct interpretation is as follows. The term <i>Elohim</i> (god) is an adjective. The angels are called elohim.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 26).</i> So are the judges.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>.</i> Who can know what is in the mind of the one who curses? However, if he enunciates the glorious name of God, which stands by itself and is not an adjective and is not intertwined with any noun, [he shall be stoned]. Its meaning is,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>Whosoever curseth his God</i>.</i> when one curses and enunciates the Name he shall be put to death if he enunciates the Name as the son of the Egyptian did.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, verses 15 and 16 are connected to each other.</i> The Name<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">God’s name.</i> is not mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 17.</i> out of respect for God. Scripture reads, <i>as well the stranger, as the home-born…shall be put to death</i>. It is possible that the ones who quarreled (v. 10) struck each other. This section<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 17-22.</i> was therefore written.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">At this point. In other words, the laws dealing with personal injuries follow the laws of the men who quarreled because the latter came to blows.</i> It<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The section about the laws dealing with personal injuries. See Ex. 21:12-27.</i> had previously been mentioned. However, our chapter adds, <i>as well for the stranger, as for the home-born</i> (v. 22).[17. AND HE THAT SMITETH.] Scripture begins<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The laws dealing with personal injury.</i> with <i>and he that smiteth any man mortally</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Shall be put to death.</i> He is not participating in war and deliberately smites any man, be that man a stranger or a native

Verse 17



Verse 18

AND HE THAT SMITETH A BEAST MORTALLY SHALL MAKE IT GOOD. Note, the phrase <i>life for life</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Which concludes verse 18.</i> serves two verses.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 17 and 18. I.E. reads verse 17 as follows: <i>And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death</i>, life for life.</i>

Verse 19

SO SHALL IT BE DONE TO HIM. Samson said, <i>so have I done unto them</i> (Jud. 15:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The full clause reads, <i>As they did unto me, so have I done unto them</i>. The latter is not to be taken literally, for Samson did not repay his enemies exactly tit for tat. We thus see that <i>as he hath done, so shall it be done to him</i> is not necessarily to be taken literally. It rather means punishment is to be inflicted.</i> The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> brought proof from logic that <i>breach for breach</i> (v. 20) cannot be taken literally. The first wound was made unintentionally. How can we justify making a similar wound?<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah does not distinguish (except for murder) between one who harms his neighbor intentionally and one who harms him unintentionally. This being the case, if someone wounded his neighbor unintentionally, how can we justify making a similar wound in him? It should be noted that Rabbi Saadiah Gaon held that the Torah does not contain laws that contradict reason.</i> If the wound is in a vital area, the person will die. The same applies to the eye. How are we to do the same to one who injured his neighbor by causing him to suffer the loss of a third of the sight of an eye?<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">How can we be sure that we are only removing a third of the eye’s vision of the one guilty of doing the same to his neighbor?</i> The words of tradition are thus true.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>as he hath done, so shall it be done to him</i> is not to be taken literally. It rather means that he shall make commensurate compensation.</i> Scripture is to be understood as follows. Ransom money is to be paid in all of these cases. It is fitting to remove his eye if he does not ransom it.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E.’s short commentary on Ex. 21:24 the eye of the one who blinds his neighbor is removed if he refuses to pay ransom.</i> Should one argue against us and say, what happens if the injurer is poor? Then we answer, Scripture speaks about the majority of cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Most people are not poor.</i> It is possible for the poor to become rich.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">That is, furthermore it is possible for the poor to become rich. In other words, the poor will pay when they eventually have the means to do so.</i> This also answers those who argue, what shall we do in instances when the injurer of the eye is blind?<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">And the law of an eye for an eye cannot be applied literally. I.E. in his commentary on Ex. 21:24 (Vol. 2, p. 476) quotes Saadiah Gaon as arguing that <i>an eye for an eye</i> cannot be taken literally, for what shall we do in instances when the injurer is blind? I.E. here counters that argument by saying that Scripture speaks of what is usual, and in cases where a blind person blinds someone the penalty of an eye for an eye is not applicable.</i>

Verse 20

SO SHALL IT BE RENDERED UNTO HIM.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>bo</i> (literally in him). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> There are instances where the <i>bet</i> has the meaning of on.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>bo</i> means unto him. I.E. renders our clause, “so shall it be rendered upon him,” i.e., a penalty shall be placed upon him.</i> Compare, <i>the beast that I rode upon</i> (bah) (Neh. 2:12). There are many such instances. On the other hand, its meaning might be, so shall it be rendered unto him if he does not pay ransom.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In this case <i>bo</i> means unto him.</i> 

Verse 21

[AND HE THAT KILLETH A BEAST.] Scripture repeats <i>And he that killeth a beast…</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And he that killeth a man…</i></i> because it wants to mention the stranger, for when Scripture speaks of maiming (v. 19) it speaks of an Israelite, for the Torah clearly says,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 19.</i> <i>his neighbor</i>. However, there is one law for both the stranger and the native regarding he that kills a person and he that kills a beast.I have previously informed you that Scripture is being brief when two <i>cafs</i> come together.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">That is, when two words with a <i>kaf</i> prefix follow each other. Our verse reads <i>ka-ger ka-ezrach</i> (as well for the stranger, as for the home-born). According to I.E. <i>ka-ger ka-ezrach</i> is short for <i>ha-ger ke-ezrach, ve-ha’ezrach ka-ger</i> (the stranger is like the home-born and the home-born is like the stranger). See I.E. on Gen. 44:18 (Vol. 1, p. 396).</i> Scripture also chooses to employ brevity when it does not add “and he dies” to <i>u-makkeh adam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and he that strikes a man.</i> (and he that killeth a man), for it is known that the culprit is not executed unless the one who is struck dies. Another interpretation for the repetition<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Why verse 21 repeats verses 17 and 18.</i> is that Scripture earlier mentions “mortally” (v. 17).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>nefesh</i>.</i> The latter refers to a blow struck in a vital area. Scripture then lays down<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> the following general law: A person who kills shall be put to death whether the blow was struck in a vital area or in a non-vital area. The word <i>nefesh</i> (mortal) is thus not mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> 

Verse 22

[YOUR GOD.] The God of the native and the God of the stranger.

Verse 23

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID. They did from this day and onward to one who injures his neighbor, in accordance with this law.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

IN MOUNT SINAI. There is no chronological order in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This concept is first found in the Talmud and Midrash. See E. Z. Malamud, <i>Meforshe Ha-Mikreh</i>, Jerusalem, 1978, pp. 18-21.</i> This section<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Our Torah portion.</i> precedes, <i>And the Lord called</i> (Lev. 1:1) and all the sections that follow it, for the words recorded in our section were told to Moses on Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas all that procedes our chapter was told to Moses in the tent of meeting.</i> Moses now<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">After receiving the laws dealing with the Sabbatical year and what follows.</i> made the covenant recorded in the Torah portion <i>Now these are the ordinances</i> (Ex. 21:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 24:4-8. According to I.E. the covenant recorded in the Torah portion <i>Be-Chukkta</i> (Lev. 24:3-46) is the same covenant that is recorded in Ex. 24:4-8. See Nachmanides, who explains I.E. in detail.</i> Moses inserted this portion<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The laws dealing with the Sabbatical year and that which follows.</i> at this point to place in proximity the conditions under which the Israelites could dwell in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 18:28 and 20:22 tell us that Israel will dwell in the Land of Israel on condition that they refrain from perverse sexual practices. Lev. 26:34-43 tells us that Israel will dwell in the land only if they observe the Sabbatical year. Our section which deals with the Sabbatical year was inserted here to place these two conditions in the same portion.</i> He said that the land would spit out the Israelites if they violated the laws of prohibited sexual relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 18:28; 20:22.</i> He said a similar thing in the Torah portion <i>If ye walk in My statutes</i> (Lev. 26:3) with regard to the Sabbaths of the land. Moses first mentions the Sabbaths.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The section opens with the Sabbatical year. The law of the Jubilee, which follows seven Sabbatical years then follows.</i>

Verse 2

THEN SHALL THE LAND KEEP A SABBATH UNTO THE LORD. There is a commandment upon the Israelite not to allow a stranger to sow in the Sabbatical year.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture tells us that the land shall keep a Sabbath unto the Lord.</i> This is similar to the commandment that we not allow a stranger to do work on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 20:8 and I.E.’s comments thereto (Vol. 2, p. 427).</i> Scripture commands this, for the stranger is in our power.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hence we can prevent him from working on the Sabbath and sowing during the Sabbatical year.</i>
<i>A sabbath unto the Lord</i> is similar in meaning to the Sabbath day.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath day is also referred to as a <i>sabbath unto the Lord</i> (Ex. 20:10).</i> The secret of the days of the world is alluded to in this place.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:5, “There is a secret meaning to the Midrashic statement to the effect that the world will exist for six thousand years” (Vol. 1, p. 33).

Verse 3

THE PRODUCE THEREOF. Of the land mentioned in the first verse.

Verse 4

A SABBATH OF SOLEMN REST. I previously explained the meaning of <i>shabbat shabbaton</i> (a Sabbath of solemn rest).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 16:31.</i>

Verse 5

THAT WHICH GROWETH OF ITSELF. It is known that the word <i>safi’ach</i> (that which groweth of itself) is connected to the word <i>sefacheni</i> (put me)<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Or attach me.</i> in <i>Put me, I pray thee</i> (I Sam. 3:36).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Safi’ach</i> (that which groweth of itself) refers to produce which fell to the ground at the time of the harvest and attached itself to the ground (Weiser).</i> It is also known that the word <i>nezirekha</i> (undressed vine) is related to the word <i>nazir</i> (nazirite).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>nazirite</i> distances himself from a vineyard, for he is not permitted to eat of its fruit. An undressed vine is referred to by the term <i>nazir</i> because the owner of the vineyard distanced himself from the vine and did not dress it (Weiser).</i>
A YEAR OF SOLEMN REST. Its meaning is, because it is a year of solemn rest for the land; that is, the land is not in your possession in this year.

Verse 6

AND THE SABBATH-PRODUCE…SHALL BE FOR YOU. <i>Sabbath-produce</i> refers to all that the land brought out by itself. 
The meaning of <i>lakhem</i> (for you) is, for everyone.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lakhem</i> (for you) is plural. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 9

THEN SHALT THOU MAKE PROCLAMATION WITH THE BLAST OF THE HORN. There is a difference of opinion as to whether the world was created in Nisan or in Tishri.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 10a, 11a.</i> There is no need to dwell on this, for the transmitters of the law ordained that we are to say in the Rosh Ha-Shanah prayer which they established for us, “This day marks the beginning of Your works, it is a memorial of the first day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the accepted opinion among the sages is that the world was created on Rosh Ha-Shanah.</i> We also read in Scripture that the <i>shofar</i> is to be sounded in the Jubilee year in the month of Tishri at the beginning of the year.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9.</i> Furthermore,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence and the following sentence are omitted in some editions of I.E. The <i>Mikra’ot Gedolot</i> places it in parentheses.</i> the Torah, in the portion commanding the people to gather to hear the Torah read states that the Torah is to be read on the festival of Sukkot.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">At the start of the Sabbatical year. This is the way I.E. interprets Deut 31:10. See Vol. 4, p. 225. See Deut. 31:10-13.</i> Scripture writes, <i>that they may hear, and that they may learn</i> (Deut. 31:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>that they may hear, and that they may learn</i> means that they may hear, and that they may learn the entire year. See I.E. on Deut. 31:12 (Vol. 5, p. 225).</i> It is not possible for this<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The reading and the study of the Torah.</i> to take place after half a year has passed.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">If Nisan is the beginning of the year then the public reading of the Torah which initiates a mass study of the Torah takes place six months after the start of the New Year. According to I.E. this makes no sense, for the study of the Torah in the Sabbatical year is similar to the study of the Torah on the Sabbath (I.E. on Deut. 31:12). Now the study of the Torah on the Sabbath starts with the onset of the Sabbath. It does not start at midday. Similarly, the study of the Torah in the Sabbatical year. Furthermore, why waste half of a year that could be devoted to Torah study.</i> Furthermore,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following sentence are omitted in the <i>Margali’ot Tuva</i> edition of I.E. The <i>Mikra’ot Gedolot</i> places it in brackets.</i> Scripture states, <i>and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year</i> (Ex. 23:16). Similarly, <i>and the feast of the ingathering at the turn of the year</i> (Ex. 34:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the Festival of Sukkot comes at the turn of the year, not six months earlier. According to I.E. and other commentaries, the year in these two verses is agricultural, so “turn of the year” and “end of the year” have a similar meaning. See Vol. 3, pp. 503,723.</i> The faithful proof is the Sabbatical year, regarding which it is written, <i>ye shall not sow</i> (v. 11). They start sowing in the month of Marcheshvan in the Land of Israel. If the beginning of the year started in Nisan, then they would not harvest that which they sowed in the sixth year<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In the fall preceding the Sabbatical year, for harvesting is prohibited in the Sabbatical year.</i> and they would not sow,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In the seventh year.</i> for it is the Sabbatical year. Since they will not harvest<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In the seventh year.</i> what they planted in the sixth year, they will not sow twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In the sixth and in the seventh year. There is no point to sowing in the sixth year if what is planted cannot be harvested. Hence they will not sow in the sixth year. They will thus not sow in the sixth and seventh years.</i> However, Scripture states that they should not sow in the seventh year alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Scripture speaks only of not sowing in the seventh year.</i> Judah Ha-Parsi<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">An early Karaite.

For example, the wise men of India add a fifth of an hour to the quarter of the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">A solar year consists of about 365 and 1/4 days.

Note, there is no year at all to the moon.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">If we follow a lunar calendar then strictly speaking there is no year, for a year is determined by the cycle of the sun.</i> However, as the sun has no months, the calculators<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Of the calendar.</i> sought<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">For practical reasons.</i> a number of months close to that of a solar year.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Those who employed a solar calendar wanted to divide the year into months.</i> They found them to be 12.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Twelve cycles of the moon come close to one cycle of the sun.</i> The calculators<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Of the calendar.</i> sought a number of days for the month<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Of a solar year.</i> that would be close to the number of days into which a lunar month is divided.

AND YE SHALL HALLOW THE FIFTIETH YEAR. All the inhabitants with regard to working the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hallowing</i> in our context means abstaining from working the land.</i>
LIBERTY. The meaning of the word <i>deror</i> is known.

JUBILEE.

Verse 20

[OUR INCREASE.] The Sadducees<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that <i>our increase</i><sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tevu’atenu</i>.</i> proves that the year begins in Nisan.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">For what is planted in the fall is harvested in the spring. However, if the year begins in Tishri the land is not sown and there is nothing to harvest in the spring. However, our verse indicates that this is not so, for it states, <i>nor gather in our increase</i>.</i> This is no proof, for it is possible that the meaning of <i>our increase</i> is what the earth produces of itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">That which grows of itself.</i> If they<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that what the earth produces of itself is not called <i>tevu’ah</i> (increase)<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The term used in our verse.</i> but <i>safi’ach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">See verses 5 and 11.</i> then <i>ye shall eat the increase thereof</i> (tevu’atah) <i>out of the field</i> (v. 12) contradicts them.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">For the previous verse speaks of what grows of itself (<i>safi’ach</i>).</i> Furthermore, let them inform us how the Israelites were to act in the Jubilee year, for they would not sow in the sixth, seventh,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">In the sixth and seventh years of the seventh cycle of Sabbatical years.

Why didn’t Scripture mention this, for Scripture only mentions <i>for the three years</i> (v. 21).<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21 says that the sixth year will produce food for three years. However, according to the Karaites, Scripture should have said that the land would produce food for four years, i.e., for the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth years. It should be noted that I.E. interprets the three years in verse 21 as referring to the seventh, eighth and ninth years.</i> It appears to me that the meaning of <i>and it shall bring forth produce</i> (v. 21) is, I will place a blessing on the sixth year<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Of every Sabbatical year.</i> that it will be sufficient for the sixth and an additional year.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">The seventh year.</i> However, in the Jubilee year there will be food for three years and no more.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21 reads, <i>then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years</i>. I.E. interprets the aforementioned as: then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year. Now in all Sabbatical years the land will produce food for the sixth and seventh years. However, the sixth year shall bring forth produce for precisely three years when it precedes the year of Jubilee. I.E. comments thus because our verse seems to imply that God will bless the sixth year only when it precedes the Jubilee.</i> 

Verse 21

[AND IT SHALL BRING FORTH.] The word <i>ve-asat</i> (and it shall bring forth) is irregular.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-asat</i> is short for <i>ve-asetat</i>, which is a variation of <i>ve-asetah</i>.

Verse 22

THE OLD STORE. The word <i>yashan</i> (the old store) adverts to the word <i>min</i> (of).<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Not to the word <i>tevu’ah</i> (produce), which precedes it, for <i>tevu’ah</i> is feminine and <i>yashan</i> (old store) is masculine. I.E. says that <i>min ha-tevu’ah yashan</i> (of the produce, the old store) is to be interpreted as if written <i>min yashan ha-tevu’ah</i> (of the very old store of the grain).</i> The meaning of <i>min</i> (of) is, of the very thing. Similarly, <i>with</i> (min) <i>the ark-cover</i><sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">I.E renders <i>With</i> (min) <i>the ark-cover shall ye make the cherubim</i> as, of the very ark-cover shall ye make the cherubim</i> <i>shall ye make the cherubim</i> (Ex. 25:19).

Verse 23

IN PERPETUITY. The word <i>tzemitut</i> (perpetuity) is similar<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">In meaning. According to I.E. the literal meaning of our verse is, the land shall not be sold in such a way that it is permanently cut off (divorced) from its owners.</i> to <i>keritut</i> (divorcement) (Is. 50:1). The <i>tav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>tzemitut</i>. Its root is <i>tzadi, mem, tav</i>.</i> is a root letter. <i>Tzemitut</i> is related to the word <i>yatzmitem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>tzadi, mem, tav</i>.</i> (will cut them off) in <i>The Lord will cut them off</i> (Ps. 94:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets our verse as follows: the land shall not be sold in such a manner that it is permanently cut off from its owners.</i>

A FULL YEAR.

A PERPETUAL RIGHT OF REDEMPTION. <i>Olam</i> (a perpetual right) means forever. 

Verse 33

Scripture reads, <i>va-asher yigal</i> (and if a man purchase)<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>va-asher yikneh.

In other words, if a Levite buys a house from another Levite, even in a walled city, that house goes out in the Jubilee. One might think that the law governing a purchase of a house in a Levitical city by one Levite from another is the same as that governing the sale of a house in a walled city by one Israelite from another Israelite, i.e., that the house can only be redeemed during the first year of its purchase.</i> The <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-yatza</i> (then…shall go out) (v. 33) has the same meaning as the unaspirated <i>fa</i> in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> is not to be rendered as “and” but as “then” or “the like.” For the meaning of the Arabic <i>fa</i> see Vol. 1, p. xvi; p. 30.</i> A house and a city (v. 33) have one law.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>bayit ve-ir</i> (the house…in the city), which literally means a house and a city, is to be rendered a house or a city.

[IF THERE BE YET MANY YEARS.] The <i>vav</i> in <i>If there be yet many years…and if</i> (ve-im) <i>there remain but few years</i> (v. 52) is like an unaspirated <i>fa</i> in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>vav</i> in <i>ve-im</i> (v. 52) does not mean and.

Verse 55

FOR UNTO ME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ARE SERVANTS. This means you shall inform the stranger who buys an Israelite as a servant that the children of Israel are My servants.

Chapter 26



Verse 1

YE SHALL MAKE YOU NO IDOLS. Scripture speaks of an Israelite who was sold to a non-Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 25:47-55.</i> It therefore warns the Israelite against the worship of idols. He (the Israelite slave) must not serve his master in anything relating to an idol. The Israelite shall also not serve his master on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the Sabbath was mentioned in verse 2.</i> The foreigner can purchase an Israelite only under these conditions.

Verse 2

AND REVERENCE MY SANCTUARY. By coming to the sanctuary during the three pilgrimage festivals. It is possible that Scripture states <i>Ye shall make you no idols</i> because Scripture had earlier stated, <i>they are My servants</i> (Lev. 25:55). Now, since they are My servants they shall serve Me alone and not other gods.
NEITHER…A GRAVEN IMAGE. The meaning of <i>pesel</i> (a graven image) is known.
OR A PILLAR. For a graven image.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. Scripture only prohibited a pillar made for the purpose of idol worship. See I.E. on Deut. 16:22 (Vol. 5, p. 117).</i>
FIGURED. <i>Maskit</i> (figured) is a noun. It is similar to <i>marbit</i> (increase) (Lev. 25:36).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Both words are nouns that come from a root that end in a <i>heh</i> and have similar forms. The root of <i>maskit</i> is <i>sin, kaf, heh</i>. The root of <i>marbit</i> is <i>resh, bet, heh</i>.</i> <i>Maskit</i> refers to a stone with figures on it. It is related to the word <i>maskiyyot</i> (imaginations) in <i>the imaginations of their heart</i> (Ps. 73)<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That which their hearts see.</i> and <i>sekhiyyot</i> (imagery) in <i>delightful imagery</i> (Is. 2:16).
NEITHER SHALL YE PLACE…IN YOUR LAND. This<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Setting up a stone with figures on it.</i> is the way pagans worship Mercury.
FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. You shall bow to Me. It<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>even maskit</i>.</i> is so explained in the Jerusalem Targum.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to what is now referred to as Targum Jonathan. The latter renders <i>even maskit</i> by <i>setatyu chakik be-tziyurin</i> (a stone engraved with images).</i>
YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. The Sabbatical years.
AND REVERENCE MY SANCTUARY. The year of Jubilee, for Scripture clearly states, <i>it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The year of Jubilee.</i> <i>shall be holy unto you</i> (Lev. 25:12).I believe that Scripture employs <i>My sabbaths</i> in the sense of <i>And from one sabbath to another, Shall all flesh come to bow before Me</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Is. 66:23),<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>My sabbaths</i> refers to the seventh day of the week, not to the Sabbatical year.</i> for Scripture mentions <i>to bow down unto it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 and Filwarg. <i>Mikra’ot Gedolot</i> reads, and not (<i>ve-lo</i>) because Scripture mentioned <i>to bow down unto it</i>. The reading in <i>Mikra’ot Gedolot</i> is very hard to explain and appears to be in error. See Filwarg.</i> (v. 1).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>To bow down unto it</i> indicates that <i>My sabbaths</i> refers to the seventh day of the week, not to the Sabbatical year. For Is. 66:2 tells us that the Sabbath is the time that people are to come and bow before the Lord.</i> The meaning of <i>Ye shall keep My sabbaths</i> is you shall come every Sabbath to bow before Me, and not to a stone with figures on it. You shall come to My sanctuary alone. Note, Scripture mentions the chosen day,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath.</i> for this day, as I have previously noted,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 20:8 (Vol. 2, pp. 425,426).</i> was chosen for the worship of God. Scripture also mentions the chosen place.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">God’s sanctuary.</i> 
The meaning of <i>for I am the Lord</i> is, for I rested from all work on the Sabbath and My glory dwells in the sanctuary. Scripture therefore says <i>and reverence</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">My sanctuary.</i>

Verse 3

IF YE WALK IN MY STATUTES, AND KEEP…AND DO. This is a commandment to study, to teach, and to observe.

Verse 4

[THEN I WILL GIVE.] The <i>vav</i> in <i>ve-natati</i> (then I will give) is like the <i>vav</i> in <i>ve-ha’aretz</i> (now the earth) in <i>Now the earth was unformed and void</i> (Gen. 1:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>vav</i> in <i>ve-natati</i> (then I will give), like the <i>vav</i> in <i>ve-ha’aretz</i> (now the earth), does not introduce an independent verse. According to I.E. the meaning of <i>ve-natati</i> is not “and I will give,” but “then I will give.” For the <i>vav</i> in <i>ve-ha’aretz</i>, see I.E. on Gen. 1:2 (Vol. 1, p. 30).</i> When a word which has a <i>vav</i> prefixed to it<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Such as <i>ve-natati</i> (then 1 will give).</i> is ultimately accented,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As is the case with <i>ve-natati</i> (then I will give).</i> the word is an imperfect. When it is penultimately accented it is in the perfect. The above is, aside from a few instances, always the case.
HER PRODUCE. The word <i>yevulah</i> (her produce) is related to the word <i>vul</i> (food) in <i>Surely the mountains bring him forth food</i> (Job 40:20). We do not know whether the <i>yod</i> in <i>yevul</i> is a root letter or is like the <i>yod</i> in <i>yekum</i> (living substance) (Gen.7:23),<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>kof, vav, mem</i>.</i> which is not a root letter.

Verse 5

THRESHING SHALL REACH UNTO THE VINTAGE. Note, <i>when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field</i> (Ex. 23:16) is now explained as meaning from the field and the vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Field in Ex. 23:16 refers to these two types of produce, for our verse speaks of threshing and vintage.</i>
YE HAVE ENOUGH. <i>Sova</i> (enough) is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it has the form of a verb. <i>La-sova</i> is a variation of <i>li-sebo’a</i>.</i>
SAFELY. <i>La-vetach</i> (safely) has the same meaning whether spelled with a <i>lamed</i> or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads <i>vi-yeshavtem la-vetach</i> (and dwell in…safely). I.E. says that the verse would have the same meaning if it read <i>vi-yeshavtem betach</i>.</i> The same is true of the word <i>levadad</i> (alone) (Num. 23:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Levadad</i> and <i>levad</i> have the same meaning.</i> Note, Scripture mentions <i>sova</i> (enough) first,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing of abundance of food is mentioned before other divine gifts.</i> for that is most important. 
Scripture states, <i>and dwell in your land safely</i>, because people wander from their place in days of famine. Its meaning is similar to <i>it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be</i> (Gen. 4:12).

Verse 6

AND I WILL GIVE PEACE IN THE LAND. Among yourselves.
AND NONE SHALL MAKE YOU AFRAID. No evil beast and no enemy.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Shall make you afraid.</i> On the contrary, you will chase your enemies and they shall fall before you. 

Verse 7



Verse 8

The greater wonder shall be that a small number of you shall pursue a large number of your enemies. I have previously informed you in my book <i>Moznayim</i> that ten, one hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand are round numbers.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, are the sum of the count. The ones end in ten, the tens end in a hundred, the hundreds end in a thousand, and the thousands end in ten thousand. I.E.’s point is that if a person wants to exaggerate “ones,” he says ten; if he wants to exaggerate tens, he says a hundred; to exaggerate hundreds he says a thousand; if he wants to exaggerate thousands, he says ten thousand.</i> It is customary for one who magnifies a number to say “one to ten.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">If one wants to say that one person shall pursue many, one says he shall pursue ten. If one wants to say that a hundred shall pursue many, one says one hundred shall pursue a thousand, and so forth.</i> Compare, <i>but thou art worth ten thousand of us</i> (II Sam 18:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Ten thousand is not to be taken literally.</i> Scripture here mentions that a hundred shall be chased by five.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The usual way of making the point that Scripture is making is to say that ten shall pursue a hundred.</i> Note, Scripture doubled the number used by the one who magnifies.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">If ten chase a hundred, then five chase fifty. However, Scripture tells us that five shall purse a hundred. Hence it doubles the amount that the Israelites would pursue.</i> Each one of a hundred Israelites shall chase a hundred of their enemies.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture states, <i>and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand</i>.</i> There are those who say that Scripture adds to the number because the number is increased when the individuals come together.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Five Israelites shall chase a hundred of their enemies but a hundred Israelites shall chase ten thousand of their enemies because a hundred Israelites fighting together can achieve a greater victory per person than five Israelites fighting together.</i> Similarly, <i>How should one chase a thousand</i> (Deut. 32:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>And two put ten thousand to flight</i>. Here too the Israelites accomplish more when they fight together.</i> There is no need for this.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture employs exaggerated numbers which are not to be taken literally.</i>
AND YOUR ENEMIES SHALL FALL. This is stated a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture had already stated in the previous verse that Israel’s enemies would fall before them.</i> The repetition indicates that they will fall time after time. They will not rise again.

Verse 9

AND I WILL HAVE RESPECT UNTO YOU. To greatly increase your wealth, to make you fruitful, and to multiply you with sons and daughters. It appears to me that <i>and make you fruitful</i> is the reverse of <i>the barren womb</i> (Prov. 30:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In this case our verse is to be understood as, I will ensure that you are not barren and I will multiply you.</i>
AND WILL ESTABLISH MY COVENANT WITH YOU. In that you will be <i>as the stars of heaven for multitude</i> (Deut.1:11) and <i>as the dust of the earth</i> (Gen. 13:16).

Verse 10

AND YE SHALL EAT OLD STORE LONG KEPT. Amazingly, even though you shall be numerous there shall be so much produce that whoever will want to, shall eat from the old store and also from the old store long kept, which is older than the old store. The word <i>noshan</i> (long kept) is a <i>nifal</i>. There will be those who shall remove the old store from their house to make room for the new produce, for they will have no place to store it.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new</i>.</i> There is a commentator who says that the meaning of <i>and ye shall bring forth</i> is you shall take it out to the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">To use as seed for the new crop.</i>

Verse 11

AND I WILL SET MY TABERNACLE. You will not fear that you might ever lack anything, for My glory shall dwell among you. I am not like a human being who abhors to dwell in one place.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. might be hinting here as to why he chose a transient life.</i> Furthermore, when you go into the land of your enemies<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">When you go into exile.</i> and the temple is no longer among you,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For it will be destroyed.</i> My glory shall go with you. Note, I shall be your God. You shall be My people, for I took you out of the land of Egypt for that purpose.

Verse 12



Verse 13

AND I HAVE BROKEN THE BARS OF YOUR YOKE. Scripture employs the metaphor of a plowing bullock<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is compared to a plowing bullock who has a yoke attached to its neck.</i> that works the land of its owner, for Israel was forced to work as slaves in improving the land. The latter is clearly stated.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 1:14.</i>
UPRIGHT. <i>Kommemiyyut</i> means upright. 

Verse 14

The empty heads say that there are more curses than blessings. However, they do not speak the truth. What Scripture does is to speak of the blessings in general terms. However, it lists the curses in detail in order to frighten and scare the listeners. What I say will be clear to the one who reads the text carefully.
ALL THESE COMMANDMENTS. These that are written.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The commandments written in the Torah.</i>

Verse 15

BUT BREAK. The word <i>le-hafrekhem</i> (but break) is grammatically irregular,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>la-hafirkhem</i> or <i>la-haferkhem</i></i> for the forms of verbs change.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Scripture occasionally employs irregular forms.</i>

Verse 16

AND I WILL APPOINT…OVER YOU. As one who is appointed over another does whatever he wants, to him.
TERROR…EVEN CONSUMPTION AND FEVER. Common diseases. The meaning of <i>et</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Here. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 27).</i> (even) is “with”. 
The meaning of <i>behalah</i> (terror) is that you will be terrified and will not know what to do. There are those who say that <i>behalah</i> (terror) means suddenly.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The diseases will strike suddenly and you will not be able to guard against them.</i> Many say that <i>shachefet</i> (consumption) and <i>kadachat</i> (fever) are diseases of the seed like blasting<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>shiddafon</i>.</i> and mildew,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>yerakon</i>.</i> for Scripture clearly states that the latter are such diseases (Amos 4:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">We know that blasting and mildew are diseases of the seed because Scripture speaks thus of them in Amos 4:9.</i> They say this<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>shachefet</i> (consumption) and <i>kadachat</i> (fever) are diseases of the seed.</i> because our verse states, <i>and ye shall sow your seed in vain</i>. However, there is no need for this,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">To interpret <i>shachefet</i> (consumption) and <i>kadachat</i> (fever) as diseases of the seed on the basis of the verse’s stating <i>and ye shall sow your seed in vain</i>.</i> for the meaning of our verse is that they shall be struck with illnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">That is, with <i>shachefet</i> (consumption) and <i>kadachat</i> (fever).</i> and if marauders shall come to the villages they shall then eat their seed, for there will not be anyone to go out and scatter the raiders.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it</i>.</i> 
The meaning of <i>that shall make the eyes to fail</i> is that these diseases will darken the eyes and languish the soul. The <i>alef</i> is missing in the word <i>medivot</i> (languish) in and <i>the soul to languish</i>. It is similarly missing in the word <i>mezin</i> (giveth ear) in <i>And a liar giveth ear</i> (Prov.17:4). Some say that <i>the eyes to fail</i> speaks of the eyes of the body<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>the eyes to fail</i> is to be taken literally, not as a metaphor.</i> because it goes on to say <i>and the soul to languish</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The soul will languish because the eyes fail.</i> However, there is no need for this interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For just as <i>and the soul to languish</i> refers to spiritual pain so does <i>the eyes to fail</i>.</i>

Verse 17

AND I WILL SET MY FACE AGAINST YOU. My wrath and My anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>My face</i> means My anger.</i> Compare, <i>and her countenance</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Or her face.</i> <i>was no more</i> (I Sam. 1:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. this is to be interpreted as she no longer was angry.</i> The meaning of our verse is that those that remain and are not stricken by disease will be smitten before their enemies, should they go out to fight them. At other times they will flee when no one pursues them as in the case of the Aramean camp.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See II Kings 7:6,7. The Arameans panicked and fled because they thought that they were about to be attacked by a superior force. In reality, no one was about to engage them.</i>

Verse 18

AND IF YE WILL NOT YET FOR THESE THINGS. The plagues.
SEVEN. The number seven is used for “many” because it is a complete number.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">It has special significance. See I.E. on Num. 23:1.</i> Similarly, <i>For a righteous man falleth seven times</i> (Prov. 24:16); <i>While the barren hath born seven</i> (I Sam. 2:5). <i>Al chatatekhem</i> (for your sins) does not add the number seven to each sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins</i> does not mean that they will be punished seven times for each sin.</i> Its meaning is, I will punish you again for each sin. <i>Ve-yasafti</i> (then …more) is similar to <i>yasaf</i> (more) in <i>and it went on no more</i> (Deut. 5:19). 
The meaning of <i>al chatatekhem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Al chatatekhem</i> literally means on your sins. Hence I.E.’s comments.</i> is, because of your sins. Some say that the number seven is to be taken literally.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rashi, Targum Jonathan, and the <i>Sifra</i>.</i> However, the first interpretation<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">That the number seven is not to be taken literally.</i> is correct, for if we count <i>And I will break…</i>(v. 19) as one; <i>your heaven as iron</i> (v. 19) as two; <i>and your earth as brass</i> (v. 19);<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">As three.</i> <i>And your strength shall be spent in vain</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">As four.</i> (v. 20); <i>for your land…her produce</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">As five.</i> (v. 20); <i>the trees of the land…their fruit</i> (v. 20), then we have six. Note, the plague of <i>beast of the field</i> (v. 22) makes seven.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture mentions the plague of <i>beast of the field</i> after it states, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you. If Scripture was listing the seven plagues that God would bring upon Israel, then the plague of the beasts would have been mentioned before the statement, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you.</i>

Verse 19

THE PRIDE OF YOUR POWER. The satiated,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">From an abundance of food.</i> as in <i>But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked</i> (Deut. 32:15). When the proud are broken they fall and are brought low.

Verse 20

AND YOUR STRENGTH SHALL BE SPENT IN VAIN. The strength which you expended in working the soil.

Verse 21

CONTRARY. Many say that the meaning of <i>keri</i> (contrary) is power and might.

In this case the word <i>halikhat</i> is missing from our text.</i> I have already shown you many such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Where Scripture omits a word.</i> Note, our verse reads <i>according to your sins</i>.

The meaning of <i>al chatatekhem</i> (for your sins)<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Not in addition to or more than your sins.</i> is because of your sins.

Verse 22

AND I WILL SEND…AMONG YOU. <i>Ve-hishlakhti</i> (and I will send) is related to the word <i>mashli’ach</i> (send) in <i>behold, I will send</i> (Ex.8: 17).<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, “send” here has the meaning of sending misfortune.</i>

YE WILL NOT BE CORRECTED. <i>Tivvaseru</i> (be corrected) is a <i>nifal</i> imperfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>yod, samekh, resh</i>.</i>

THE VENGEANCE OF THE COVENANT.

Verse 26

WHEN I BREAK. <i>Shivri</i> (I break) is an infinitive. It is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than with a small <i>kamatz</i>.</i> Compare, <i>shikhvah</i> (she lay down) in <i>when she lay down, nor when she arose</i> (Gen. 19:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">It too is an infinitive and is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> rather than with a small <i>kamatz</i>.</i> The Torah employs the term <i>break</i> because it speaks of the <i>staff of bread</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">A staff breaks.</i> The latter is a metaphor. We find that Isaiah employs the phrase <i>stay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>mishan</i> (a staff).</i> <i>of bread</i> (Is.3:1), for bread <i>stays man’s heart</i> (Ps. 104:15).

Verse 30

YOUR SUN-PILLARS. <i>Chammnekhem</i> is related to the word <i>chammah</i> (sun).<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>chet, mem, mem</i>.</i> <i>Chammnekhem</i> refers to structures built for the purpose of bowing down to the sun.

YOUR CARCASSES. <i>Pigrekhem</i> means your carcasses. Compare, <i>As a carcass</i> (peger) <i>trodden under foot</i> (Is. 14:19).
YOUR IDOLS. <i>Gillulekhem</i> (your idols) is a disparaging term for idols. <i>Gillulekhem</i> is related to the word <i>galal</i> (dung) in <i>sweepeth away dung</i> (I Kings 14:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gillulekhem</i> literally means your dung.</i> The meaning of our verse is that when Israel joins themselves to temples dedicated to idol worship they will be killed there and their enemies will destroy the images of their idols. I (God) will not help them.
AND MY SOUL SHALL ABHOR YOU. The divine presence shall be removed. 

Verse 31

and <i>your cities</i> will then be destroyed and your sanctuaries desolated. <i>Your sanctuaries</i> (v. 31) refers to the temples, which were at first My (God’s) sanctuaries.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they are referred to as your sanctuaries rather than My sanctuaries.</i>

Verse 32

After stating <i>your cities</i> and <i>your sanctuaries</i>, Scripture mentions the land. The reference is to all of the Land of Israel.
SHALL BE ASTONISHED AT IT. There will be so much destruction that the enemies who dwell there will also be astonished. Our verse is in contrast to <i>The joy of the whole earth</i> (Lam. 2:15).

Verse 33

WILL I SCATTER. <i>Ezareh</i> (will I scatter) is a <i>pi’el</i>. Not only will you be scattered but <i>I will also draw out the sword after you</i>. 
The meaning of <i>draw out</i> is draw out from its sheath.
AND YOUR LAND. This is connected to the verse which follows it. Its meaning is, when your land shall be desolate it will then be paid for its Sabbaths.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">See next verse.</i> 

Verse 34

The word <i>tirtzeh</i> means pay. Compare, <i>Till he shall accomplish</i><sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Or pay, i.e., pay with his labor.</i> (yirtzeh), <i>as a hireling, his day</i> (Job 14:6); <i>That her guilt is paid off</i> (nirtzah) (Is. 40:2).

The meaning of <i>as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies’ land</i> is that the land will be desolate, for you will not inhabit it. Then the land will not be worked and it will find rest and complete its Sabbaths.

Verse 35

[35. AS LONG AS IT LIETH DESOLATE.] The meaning of <i>as long as it lieth desolate</i> is, the number of years that it shall not be worked. This is explained in Ezekiel.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">The prophet Ezekiel was commanded to lie on his left side for 390 days and on his right side for 40 days. Each of these days represented a year that the Israelites sinned in not observing the Sabbatical years. See Ezek. 4:4-6. Also see Rashi on our verse and on Ezekiel.</i>

Verse 36

AND AS FOR THEM THAT ARE LEFT OF YOU. Scripture says this because it previously stated, <i>and I will draw out the sword after you</i> (v. 33).<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And as for them that are left of you</i> (v. 36) refers to those who survive the sword’s destruction.</i>

Verse 38

SHALL EAT YOU UP. It is the norm for most of those exiled to other places to die because of the effect that the change in the air and the water has upon them.

Verse 39

AND THEY THAT ARE LEFT. And from those that are left.
[SHALL PINE AWAY.] <i>Yimmakku</i> (shall pine away) follows the form of <i>yissabbu</i> (turned) in <i>they turned not</i> (Ezek. 1:9). Both words come from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yimmakku</i> comes from the root <i>mem, kof, kof.

AND ALSO IN THE INIQUITIES OF THEIR FATHERS SHALL THEY PINE AWAY WITH THEM. Its meaning is like that of <i>Our fathers have sinned</i> (Lam. 5:7). I explained this in my commentary on Lamentations.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. there explains Lam. 5:7 as meaning our sins were joined to the sins of our fathers and the combinations of our and our father’s sins reached the stage where punishment was due.

Verse 40

AND THEY SHALL CONFESS. <i>Ve-hitvaddu</i> (and they shall confess) is a <i>hitpa’el</i>.
IN THEIR TREACHERY WHICH THEY COMMITTED AGAINST ME. Which their fathers committed against Me.
AND ALSO THAT THEY HAVE WALKED CONTRARY UNTO ME. These, their children, have walked contrary unto Me.

THEY THEN BE PAID THE PUNISHMENT OF THEIR INIQUITY. <i>Yirtzu</i> (be paid) means they will compensate and pay.

Verse 42

Verse 43

FOR THE LAND SHALL LIE FORSAKEN WITHOUT THEM. This means I will also remember the land that paid off its Sabbaths and was forsaken without them. I will also remember that they paid for their sin.
BECAUSE, EVEN BECAUSE. The first <i>because</i> corresponds to <i>they rejected Mine ordinances</i>. The second one corresponds to <i>and their soul abhorred My statutes</i>. The <i>bet</i> of <i>ve-ya’an</i> (even because) is superfluous.

NEITHER WILL I ABHOR THEM. <i>Ge’altim</i> (will I abhor them) means I did not turn away from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">I did not treat them as an abhorrent thing.</i> Or, it means I did not abhor them.
TO BREAK MY COVENANT. Which I made with them by oath. Even though, as Scripture states, they broke My covenant, I will not break My covenant with them, for I am the Lord.

Verse 45

BUT I WILL FOR THEIR SAKES REMEMBER. Forever.
THE COVENANT OF THEIR ANCESTORS.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>rishonim</i> (literally, the first).</i> The reference is to the covenant made at Sinai.

The first interpretation appears to me to be the correct one.

WHICH THE LORD MADE BETWEEN HIM AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This alludes to the covenant made at Sinai, for after the tabernacle was erected and the glory was present in the tent of meeting, Moses did not ascend Mount Sinai.
