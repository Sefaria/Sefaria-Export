<b><i>Mishkon</i> of Testimony. </b>This is the Tent of Meeting, the <i>Mishkon</i> of the Ark that contained the Tablets of Testimony. 
<b>And over all of its utensils. </b>Such as the Menorah, the Table, and the Altars. 
<b>And over all that belongs to it. </b>This refers to the utensils used for the utensils.
<b>They shall carry.</b> They are the ones who carry when the camp travels, and they are the ones who serve when they are in an encampment, and they shall camp surrounding the <i>Mishkon</i>.

<b>With the insignia</b>. There were insignias on each banner. The Sages said that Reuven’s banner had the picture of a man, based on the mandrakes, Yehudah’s banner had a lion, to which he was compared by Yaakov, Ephraim had the picture of an ox, based on “the firstborn ox,” Dan’s banner had the picture of an eagle, until they resembled the cherubs seen by the prophet Yechezkel.  
<b>מנגד</b>. At a distance.

Many have erred in the explanation of the verse <b>and the Curtain and all of the work involving these things — </b>but the clear truth is that it refers to the Curtain of the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. <b>All of the work</b> — its ropes.

<b>Being spoken.</b> This was always the way Hashem spoke to him.

 <b>The Tent of Testimony</b>. In this case the ל of לאהל means <i>on</i> the Tent of Meeting, and there are many examples of this.

 <b>And followed Me fully.</b> He followed My word and fulfilled it, for the Land of Israel is very good and there was no bad report to be said.

Verse 39

<b>And it will be to you for fringes.</b> Anyone who has a garment with four corners is commanded to always wear it during the day, and not take it off, so that he shall remember. Those that pray with a tallis [only] during the time of prayer do so because of the verses they read during the Shema: “Make for themselves, <i>tzitzis</i>-fringes” and “And it will be to you for fringes.” In my view, however, one has a greater obligation to wear <i>tzitzis</i> at other times than prayer, so that he will remember and not err, and not commit a transgression at any time. During prayer, however, he will likely not transgress. 
<b>And you will look upon it.</b> It is a commandment for the <i>tzitzis</i> to be seen.
<b>After [the desire of] your hearts.</b> The eye sees and the heart desires. The <i>tzitzis</i> are a sign that a person should not chase after his desirous thoughts and anything his eyes seek.
<b>Which cause you to go astray.</b> Someone who follows after his desires is straying from the service of his God.

Verse 40

<b>In order that you will remember.</b> It already said, “And you will remember all of Hashem’s commandments.” This teaches that if you will remember you will be holy, and you will not become defiled by the heart’s desires, which pollute the intellect.

Chapter 16



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>You have [taken] too much for yourselves.</b> This is similar to די לכם — it is enough for you, i.e., you have seized the larger portion.  
<b>Since the entire congregation are all holy.</b> From the day of standing at Mount Sinai, the entire congregation became holy. 
<b>And Adonoy is in their midst.</b> The Levites were chosen after Hashem’s honor was in the midst of Bnei Yisroel. And even if Moshe knew that the tribe of Levi would be chosen when he was at Mount Sinai, he never told the Bnei Yisroel.  
<b>Why do you raise yourselves</b> — for Aharon to be the <i>Kohein Gadol</i>, and Moshe above him, for he taught him.

<b>We will not go up.</b> It is possible that the Tent of Meeting was located on high ground within the camp, and therefore it was appropriate to use the language “go up.” Alternatively, it can be explained that one who goes to the service of Hashem or to the chosen place is going up.

<b>If one man sins.</b> This refers to Korach, who congregated the entire congregation against Moshe and Aharon. Some hold the view that <b>Almighty, the God of the spirits </b>connotes that He has the power to search out a man’s spirit because He is his God, and He knows that one man alone, Korach, sinned, even if he caused others to sin.

<b>In the Book of the Wars of Adonoy.</b> This was a separate Book, in which the Wars of Hashem on behalf of those who fear Him were written. Possibly, it existed in the days of Avraham, for many books were lost and are not extant anymore, such as the words of Nasan and Ido, the Divrei HaYamim of the Kings of Yisroel, the Songs of Shlomo and his Proverbs.

<b>Behold, a people that rises like a young lion.</b> This is a hint that they will conquer the Canaanite kings in a similar way, for example, as their victory against Midian which was unheard of. Not a single person from Israel was lost, five kings were killed, and the number of women captives who had not had relations with a man was thirty-two thousand.
<b>And drinks the blood of its kill.</b> The entire army and all the spoils. This verse could also be interpreted as: Moshe does not lie down until he devours his prey. Similarly, the verse says (31:2), Take revenge for Bnei Yisroel against the Midianites, afterwards, you shall be gathered to your people (die).

<b>But the sons of Korach did not die.</b> The testimony to this is Shmuel and his sons and sons’ sons, who were the singers (see Divrei HaYamim I 6:18-22), and they were called the Korachites (Divrei HaYamim II 20:19), also: “For the conductor, by the sons of Korach, a song” (Tehillim 49:1). Additionally, in the Torah it is written (v. 58) “and the Korachite family” as well. Scripture mentioned the sons of Korach together with the sons of Reuven because all the sons of Dasan and Aviram died, even the minors. Thus, the evil that befell Dasan and Aviram was worse than that of Korach.

Verse 21



Chapter 28



Verse 1

<b>Command Bnei Yisroel.</b> The reason the section on offerings is placed here is because Hashem then asked Moshe to command Bnei Yisroel about the obligatory offerings, for he would not enter the Land with them. Scripture begins by mentioning the constant burnt-offering. Although it was mentioned earlier (Shemos 29:42), perhaps that mention was only on Mount Sinai; alternatively, it is mentioned here as well so that the entire system of offerings would be in order.
