Ibn Ezra on Numbers



Chapter 1



Verse 1

In the name of God who counted those numbered above<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The stars. See Ps. 147:4, <i>He counteth the number of the stars</i>.</i> and below;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i>I begin to explain according to the plain meaningthe Torah portion which begins with <i>va-yedabber</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Book of Numbers begins with the word <i>va-yedabber</i> (spoke).</i> IN THE WILDERNESS. This verse<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which states that <i>the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting</i>.</i> informs us that Moses did not go up to Mount Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For revelation.</i> since God’s glory was now present in the tent of meeting.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, what follows would have been told to Moses on Mount Sinai.</i>
ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE SECOND MONTH. To tell him to arrange the standards and to instruct him how the Israelites were to journey and how they were to camp with reference to the tabernacle,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Filwarg suggests emending <i>ba’avur ha-mishkan</i> (with reference to the tabernacle) to <i>be’evre ha-mishkan</i> (on the sides of the tabernacle).</i> for they journeyed on the twentieth day of the second month.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it was necessary to inform Moses of these things prior to their journey.</i>

Verse 2

TAKE YE THE SUM. <i>Se’u et rosh bene yisra’el</i> (take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel) is similar to <i>ki tissa et rosh bene yisra’el</i> (when thou takest the sum of the children of Israel) (Ex. 30:12). I have explained its meaning there.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Exodus, (Vol. 2, p. 631). I.E. explains that <i>ki tissa et rosh</i> literally means: when you lift up the head. One who takes a census writes the particulars after the sum, which he writes at the top of the page. Thus when Scripture speaks of raising up the head, it means take up the sum.</i>
BY THEIR FAMILIES BY THEIR FATHER’S HOUSES. For pedigree is not determined by the mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture qualified <i>by their families</i> with <i>by their fathers’ houses</i>.</i>
BY THEIR POLLS. I have already explained the meaning of <i>gulgelotam</i> (their polls).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>gulgelotam</i> (their polls) literally means their skulls. In his short commentary (S.C.) on Exodus, I.E. explains that the word <i>gulgolet</i> means a head. The head is so called because it is round. Compare, <i>galgal</i> (wheel, i.e., a round object). See I.E. on Ex. 16:16 (S.C.).</i>

Verse 3

IN ISRAEL. This excludes the mixed multitude.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Foreigners who joined Israel during the Exodus. See Ex. 12:38.</i>

Verse 4

EVERY ONE HEAD OF HIS FATHERS’ HOUSE. <i>Ish rosh le-vet avotav</i> (every one head of his fathers’ house) is an abridged phrase. The text should have read, <i>ish ish rosh le-vet avotav</i> (every one head of his fathers’ house).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The first part of the verse reads, <i>ish ish la-matteh</i> (a man of every tribe). Hence, in keeping with the rules of parallelism, the second part of the verse should read, <i>ish ish rosh le-vet avotav hu</i>) (every one head of his father’s house).</i>

Verse 5

OF REUBEN. Scripture begins with Jacob’s first-born,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Jacob took away Reuben’s birthright. See Gen. 49:3,4.</i> as it is stated, <i>yet not so that he was to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born</i> (I Chron. 5:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I Chronicles explains that even though Reuben lost his birthright to Joseph, he was always to be reckoned as the first-born as far as genealogy was concerned.</i>

Verse 10

OF THE CHILDREN OF JOSEPH. The children of Joseph are mentioned after the children of Leah because Rachel’s status was greater than that of the handmaids.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Rachel’s descendants are mentioned before those of the handmaids even though the children of the handmaids precede them in birth.</i> Scripture begins with Ephraim, in keeping with the actions of our father Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Manassah was older than Ephraim. However, Jacob placed Ephraim before Manasseh. See Gen. 48:21.</i> Scripture places Ephraim and Manasseh<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph’s sons.</i> before Benjamin because they are in place of Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph was born before Benjamin.</i> Scripture then begins with Dan,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The son of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid.</i> who was the first-born of the handmaids.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Of the children born to the handmaids’. See Gen. 30:6.</i> Asher follows Dan<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Gad and Asher were the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid. According to Gen. 30:10-13, Gad was Zilpah’s first-born. Thus Scripture should have mentioned Gad before Asher. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> because God knew that Asher would be the head of those who camp under the standard of Dan.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Asher pitched next to Dan and was therefore next in importance under that standard. Gad was third under the standard of Reuben. See Num. 2:14,27.</i> Scripture then mentions Gad because he was the first-born of Leah’s handmaid.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 30:10,11.</i>

Verse 16

THESE WERE THE ELECT OF THE CONGREGATION. The meaning of <i>keru’e ha-edah</i> (the elect of the congregation)<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the called of the congregation. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> is that the congregation does nothing unless they are called.
THE TRIBES OF THEIR FATHERS. The meaning of <i>mattot avotam</i> is the tribes of their fathers. Thus each one<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Each one of those listed in verses 5-16.</i> was prince of a tribe.
THEY WERE THE HEADS OF THE THOUSANDS OF ISRAEL. Each one was a leader over all the thousands that comprised a tribe, for there was also a chief over one thousand.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The tribes were divided into units of thousands. Each of these units was headed by a <i>sar</i> (chief). See Ex. 18:21, <i>sarei alafim</i> (rulers over thousands). Also see I Sam. 17:8, <i>sar ha-elef</i> (the captain of their thousand). Each one listed in verses 5-15 was the head of all the captains of the thousands of their respective tribes.</i>

Verse 17

AND MOSES AND AARON TOOK. With them.
THAT ARE POINTED OUT BY NAME. <i>Nikkevu</i> means that are pointed out. Compare, <i>yikkvennu</i> (mark out) in <i>Which the mouth of the Lord shall mark out</i> (Is. 62:2).

Verse 18

AND THEY DECLARED THEIR PEDIGREES. They were asked for their birth dates,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical text reads, <i>va-yityalledu</i> (and they declared their pedigrees). I.E. translates this as: they gave their birth dates.</i> for only those from twenty and above were to be counted. Their progeny were then recorded.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 2. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, “Or, their progeny were recorded.” According to this interpretation, <i>va-yityalledu</i> means: and they declared their children.</i>

Verse 19

SO DID HE NUMBER THEM. The reference is to Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yifkedem</i> (so did he count them) is in the singular. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> who was the most important.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Actually Aaron and the heads of the tribes also participated in counting the people (see verse 44). However, Scripture here mentions only Moses, because he was the most important.</i> Scripture begins<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The count.</i> with Reuben,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i> as he was the first-born. Simeon is next<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> because he was born after Reuben. Gad the first-born of Leah’s handmaid,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See note 24.</i> follows. We thus have Reuben’s standard.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 20-25. The tribes listed in verses 20-25 (Reuben, Simeon, and Gad) made up the standard of Reuben. See Num. 2:10-16.</i> Next<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 26-30.</i> comes the standard of Judah,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 2:3-9.</i> followed by the standard of Ephraim<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 32-37. Also see Num. 2:18-24.</i> and the standard of Dan.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 38-43. Also see Num. 2:25-31.</i> Those who camped around each standard did so in the same manner in which they offered the sacrifices dedicating the altar. Note, there were twelve tribes,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 20-43; and in Num. 2:10-31.</i> for Levi was not counted and Joseph’s two sons were. Now the world has four sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">North, south, east, and west.</i> Behold, three tribes camped on each one of the four sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For purposes of symmetry.</i> Now Leah had five sons,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">That is, five of Leah’s six sons were counted among the twelve tribes of Israel. They were Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</i> for one of her six sons<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Levi.</i> was not counted. She had two standards.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The standards of Judah and Reuben. See Num. 2:3-16.</i> They [Moses and Aaron] completed one of her standards<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The standard of Reuben. See Num. 2:10-16.</i> with [Gad] the first-born of her handmaid.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See note 20.</i> They placed Gad with the standard of Reuben, who was also a first-born. Judah made up the second standard [of Leah]. His younger brothers camped with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Issachar and Zebulun.</i> Rachel had a standard of her own.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The standard of Ephraim. See Num. 2:18-24.</i> Ephraim was in place of Joseph. He preceded Manasseh, in keeping with the words of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 48-14-20.</i> The fourth standard was that of Rachel’s handmaid. It was led by [Dan] her first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 2:25-31.</i> Asher followed<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Asher pitched next to Dan. See Num. 2:27.</i> even though he was younger than Naphtali.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The standard of Dan consisted of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali. Asher, who was younger than Naphtali, pitched next to Dan.</i> The son of Leah’s handmaid<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Asher.</i> was so honored because the standard belonged to Rachel’s handmaid.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Asher, son of the handmaid Zilpah, was pacified for being under the standard of Dan, the son of the handmaid Bilhah, by being placed before Naphtali, another son of Bilhah.</i> If you look carefully into things, you will know that the south is the head and the north the tail.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The sun in its annual journey moves from north to south. The face of the sun is thus to the south while its back, the tail, is to the north (see Weiser).</i> I cannot explain the aforementioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">When I.E. uses this expression it means that he is unable or does not want to explain further.</i> Reuben was therefore placed in the south<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The standard of Reuben was on the south side of the tabernacle. See Num. 2:10.</i> because he was the head.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">He was the first-born.</i> Dan was placed in the north.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">That is, at the tail of the camp. See Num. 2:25.</i> Observe, there was no one among the tribes comparable in might to Judah, who was compared to a lion’s whelp (Gen. 49:9),<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In Jacob’s blessing.</i> and to the tribe of Dan, who is likewise compared to a lion by Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 33:22.</i> These tribes were thus first and last.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">When the tribes marched, the standard of Judah marched first and that of Dan last. See Num. 10:14-25.</i> Scripture mentions <i>by their polls</i> (le-gulgelotam) with regard to Reuben<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i> and also with regard to Simeon<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> to show that it was the same case with the other tribes,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the term is not mentioned with regard to the other tribes.</i> for Scripture was being brief.

[AND ALL THOSE THAT WERE NUMBERED OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BY THEIR FATHERS’ HOUSES, FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD.] It means that only those who were aged twenty and above were counted. Scripture then goes on to say,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 46.</i> <i>even all those that were numbered</i>. The latter refers to their<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Those 20 and older.</i> total number.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our verse speaks of the age of those numbered, while verse 46 speaks of the total number of those who were counted.</i>

Verse 46



Verse 47

WERE NOT NUMBERED AMONG THEM. The word <i>hotpakdu</i> (were not numbered) is of two forms. It is both a <i>hitpa’el</i> and a <i>hofal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i> and <i>tav</i> placed in front of the root is the sign of the <i>hitpa’el</i>. The <i>kamatz katan</i> placed beneath the <i>heh</i> is the sign of the <i>hofal</i>.</i>

Verse 48



Verse 49

HOWBEIT THE TRIBE OF LEVI THOU SHALT NOT NUMBER. This explains <i>were not numbered</i> (v. 47),<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, why inform us once again that the Levites were not counted.</i> that the Levites were not numbered because this is what God commanded.
NEITHER SHALT THOU TAKE THE SUM OF THEM. Their total number, as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Scriptures reads, <i>ve-et rosham lo tissa</i> (neither shalt thou take the sum of them). This literally means <i>neither shalt thou lift up their heads</i>. I.E. earlier noted that <i>to lift up the head</i> means to write the total sum at the top of a page. See I.E.’s comment on verse 2.</i>

Verse 50

BUT APPOINT THOU THE LEVITES OVER THE TABERNACLE. Scripture explains here why the Levites were not counted. They were not counted because the charge of the tabernacle was upon them. Therefore they did not serve in the army.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. believes that those who were counted were counted for military purposes. This is also the view of Rashbam. See Rashbam on verse 2.</i>
THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY. The reference is to the tent of meeting and the tabernacle of the ark, which contains the testimony.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The tent of meeting was called the tabernacle of testimony because it served as a tabernacle for the ark, which contained the tables of testimony (<i>luchot ha-edut</i>) (Weiser). <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads: The tabernacle of testimony refers to the ark wherein the testimonies are (that is, the tablets on which the ten commandments were written).</i>
AND OVER ALL THE FURNITURE<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads <i>kelim</i>, which means articles, utensils, or vessels. This is the way I.E. interprets the term.</i> THEREOF. Such as the menorah, the table, and the altars.
AND OVER ALL THAT BELONGETH TO IT. The reference is the utensils which serve the furniture.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the utensils which served the menorah and the table of showbread.</i>
AND THEY SHALL BEAR THE TABERNACLE. They are the very ones who carry the tabernacle when the camp journeys, and they are the ones who shall minister unto the tabernacle when they camp. They shall camp around the tabernacle.

Verse 51

AND WHEN THE TABERNACLE SETTETH FORWARD, THE LEVITES SHALL TAKE IT DOWN. They shall remove its bars and posts. When the tabernacle rests, they shall set it up.
AND THE COMMON MAN.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>zar</i> is a stranger. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> A person who is not a Levite, even if he is an Israelite. SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH. A law court shall put him to death.

Verse 52

[AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL PITCH.] Its meaning is, “when” the children of Israel shall pitch.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>And the children of Israel shall pitch…every man with his own standard</i>. However, the command to set up standards had not yet been given. Hence I.E.’s interpretation</i>
EVERY MAN WITH HIS OWN CAMP. The meaning of every man is each tribe.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the meaning of <i>ish</i> in our verse is each and every man.</i>
[AND EVERY MAN WITH HIS OWN STANDARD.] Its meaning is that the tribe of one standard shall not be mixed with the tribe of another standard.

Verse 53

BUT THE LEVITES SHALL PITCH ROUND ABOUT THE TABERNACLE OF TESTIMONY. Our verse explains why the earlier verse<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 50.</i> stated that the Levites were to encamp round about the tabernacle:<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Krinsky’s edition of I.E. reads, “The explanation of <i>and shall encamp round about</i> (v. 50). Our verse explains why the earlier verse stated that the Levites were to encamp round about the tabernacle.”</i> so that no one from the congregation of Israel should draw close to the tabernacle and die. This is the meaning of <i>that there be no wrath upon…the children of Israel</i>, as there was in the case of Uzzah, who touched the ark.
Scripture there states, <i>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah</i> (II Sam. 6:7). The meaning of <i>upon the congregation of the children of Israel</i> is, upon anyone from the children of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">For God would not punish all of Israel for the acts of one person.</i> It is similar to <i>and was buried in the cities of Gilead</i><sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Jud. 12:7)<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, <i>And was buried in one of the cities of Gilead</i>, for Jephthah was not buried in all the cities of Gilead.</i> and <i>Even upon a colt the foal of asses</i><sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Zech. 9:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is, <i>Even upon a colt the foal of an ass</i>.</i> There are many such cases.
AND THE LEVITES SHALL KEEP THE CHARGE. The Levites are obligated to guard the tabernacle.

Verse 54

THUS DID THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. They never touched the tabernacle.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

[AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON.] Scripture reads, <i>unto Moses and unto Aaron</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In most cases, only Moses is mentioned when God addresses commands. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> because Aaron and his sons were to command the Kohathites as to which burdens they were to carry upon their shoulders.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For the burden of the Kohathites, see Num. 4:4-19.</i>

Verse 2

ACCORDING TO THE ENSIGNS. There were signs upon each and every standard. The ancients<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmudic sages.</i> said that the banner of Reuben had the form of a person on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ba-Midbar Rabbah</i> 2:6.</i> Their statement is based on a midrashic interpretation concerning the mandrakes found by Reuben.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The mandrakes have the appearance of a person. See I.E. on Gen. 30:14.</i> The ancients also tell us that there was an image of a lion on the standard of Judah, for Jacob had compared Judah to a lion.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 49:9.</i> They also tell us that the banner of Ephraim<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The son of Joseph.</i> had the image of an ox upon it, in keeping with the verse, <i>His firstling bullock</i> (Deut. 33:17). The flag of Dan had the image of an eagle. Thus the banners were similar to the cherubim which the prophet Ezekiel saw.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Each one of the cherubim seen by Ezekiel had four faces, the face of a man, an ox, an eagle, and a lion. See Ezek. 1:10. The camp of Israel similarly carried each one of these four images. In Ezekiel’s vision these cherubim supported the divine throne. Similarly, according to the sages, God’s spirit rested upon the camp of Israel.</i>
A GOOD WAY OFF. The word <i>mi-neged</i> means a good way off.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>neged</i> literally means opposite. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 3

ON THE EAST SIDE TOWARD THE SUNRISING. The beginning of the east.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>kedemah mizrachah</i>. This literally means toward the east. According to I.E., <i>kedemah mizrachah</i> is a technical term for the beginning of the east, i.e., northeast. See I.E. on Ex. 27:9 and the notes thereto (Vol. 2, pp. 581-2).</i>

Verse 4

AND HIS HOST (<i>U-FEKUDEHEM</i>). Scripture could have read <i>u-fekudav</i> (and his host).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As it does in verse 8.</i> There is no difference between the two terms.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>U-fekudehem</i> literally means and their host. <i>U-fekudav</i> means and his host. I.E. indicates that Scripture employs the singular for the plural, as the Bible uses collective nouns.</i>

Verse 5

AND THOSE THAT PITCH NEXT UNTO HIM. <i>Ve-hachonim alav</i> means those that pitch with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Alav</i> literally means on him. Thus the literal meaning of <i>ve-hachonim alav</i> (and those that pitch next unto him) is, and those that pitch upon him. Hence I.E.’s comment that <i>alav</i> means with him.</i> Issachar was behind Judah and in front of Zebulun who was third.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

THEY SHALL SET FORTH FIRST. The meaning of <i>rishonah yissa’u</i> is, they shall set forth first.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>rishonah yissa’u</i> should be read as if written <i>ba-rishonah yissa’u</i>. (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 10

ON THE SOUTH SIDE. The word <i>temanah</i> (on the south side) comes from the same root as the word <i>yemin</i> (right).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">When a person faces east, the south is at his right.</i>

Verse 17

THEN THE TENT OF MEETING, WITH THE CAMP OF THE LEVITES, SHALL SET FORWARD IN THE MIDST OF THE CAMPS. In the midst of the above-mentioned camps,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The camps of Judah and Reuben.</i> for the Gershonites and Merarites journeyed between the banner of Judah and the banner of Reuben.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 10:14-20.</i> And the Kohathites, and with them Aaron and his sons, journeyed between the banner of Reuben and the banner of Ephraim.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 10: 21-24.</i>
AS THEY ENCAMP, SO SHALL THEY SET FORWARD. The reference is to <i>the camps</i>, which refers to the camp of the Israelites. It<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>As they set encamp, so shall they set forward</i>.</i> does not refer to the camp of the Levites. The Gershonites, who pitched on the west<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 3:23.</i> of the sanctuary, and the Merarites on the north<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 3:35.</i> journeyed together,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 10:17. Unlike the way they camped.</i> after the camp of Judah who pitched on the east.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Judah who pitched on the east marched first, followed by Reuben who pitched on the south, followed by Ephraim who pitched on the west, followed by Dan who pitched on the north. However, the Levites who camped on all four sides of the tabernacle did not follow this order.</i>
EVERY MAN IN HIS PLACE. The meaning of <i>al yado</i> (in his place) is, in his corner and place.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>yado</i> literally means his hand. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The same applies to <i>yad ha-yarden</i> (by the side of the Jordan) (Num. 13:29) and <i>ve-yad tiheyah lekha</i> (and thou shalt have a paddle) (Deut. 23:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>yad</i>, literally hand, is to be rendered as place in both of these verses.</i>

Chapter 3



Verse 1

NOW THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF AARON AND MOSES. Scripture states this<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Our Torah portion deals with the census taken in the second year following the Exodus (see Num. 1:1; 3:14). The question thus arises, why does Scripture then tell us how many offspring Moses and Aaron had on the day that the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai?</i> because it wants to inform us that their offspring did not beget children and did not increase<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the generations of Moses and Aaron were the same at the time of the census as they had been on the day that Moses stood on Mount Sinai ten months earlier. Hence it was not necessary to count them again when the Levites were counted. See verse 15.</i> in close to ten months.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ten months passed from the day that Moses stood on Mount Sinai in the month of Sivan and the census was taken on the first day of the second month (Iyyar) following the Exodus.</i> God chose the tribe of Levi at the time God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, when Moses ascended to atone for the making of the golden calf. God then said to Moses, <i>Bring the tribe of Levi near</i> (v. 6). The Lord then also related all that is contained in the section<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 12 and 13.</i> that opens with <i>And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel</i> (v. 12). When the tabernacle was erected, God told Moses, <i>Number the children of Levi</i> (v. 15). God’s presence was then manifest in the tabernacle. Scripture therefore reads, <i>in the wilderness of Sinai</i> (v. 14).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">And not on Mount Sinai. The point is that the Levites were numbered when the tabernacle stood at the foot of Mount Sinai. Scripture tells us that God spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai and told him to number the Levites, because once the tabernacle was erected God’s presence was manifest there, and God spoke to Moses there. Thus what is reported in 3:1-13 took place on Mount Sinai, and what is reported in 3:14-39 took place in the wilderness of Sinai.</i> Now the descendants of Aaron and Moses in the wilderness of Sinai numbered the same as they did at Mount Sinai. However, two sons of Aaron were missing.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is the point of verse 4.</i>I therefore<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. only those who went forth to war were counted by offering half a shekel as ransom for their souls. However, the Levites were in the service of God and did not have to offer a ransom for their souls. See I.E.’s short commentary on Ex. 38:25.</i> said that the Levites did not give a ransom for their souls, for Scripture clearly states, <i>for every one that passed over to them that are numbered</i> (Ex. 38:26). Some say that Moses did not count the Israelites before the tabernacle was constructed. He knew their number only by way of prophecy. However, Scripture contradicts them. It clearly states, <i>When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel</i> (Ex. 30:11).

Verse 3

THE PRIESTS THAT WERE ANOINTED. With the anointing oil, for they were high priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Being anointed with the anointing oil (<i>shemen ha-mishkhah</i>) gave the sons of Aaron the status of high priests.</i>
[AND THEY HAD NO CHILDREN.]<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And they had no children</i> appears in verse 4, but I.E. comments upon it here.</i> They did not leave behind any grown or small children. Therefore the Levites were lacking in number,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For the other tribes increased in number from the first census. The tribe of Levi did not do so due to the loss of Nadab and Abihu.</i> for it is possible for the grown children to beget children.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture tells us that Nadab and Abihu did not have any.</i>

Verse 6

BEFORE AARON THE PRIEST. Who was the prince of the tribe. The meaning of <i>ve-ha’amadt</i> (and set them)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and stand them up.</i> is, <i>that they may minister.

AND THE CHARGE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. They will make sure that an Israelite does not enter the tabernacle.

Verse 9

THEY ARE WHOLLY GIVEN UNTO HIM. Forever. Or to them and their descendants who take their place.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>netunim netunim</i> (wholly given). This literally means, given given. I.E.’s first interpretation is that the repetition of the tern <i>netunim</i> indicates forever. His second interpretation is that the first <i>netunim</i> refers to them, and the second to their children.</i>
UNTO AARON AND TO HIS SONS. Both those who are presently alive and those who will arise after them.
FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. To be separated from the children of Israel.

Verse 10

AND THOU SHALT APPOINT AARON AND HIS SONS. <i>His sons</i> includes the sons of his sons. The meaning of <i>and thou shalt appoint</i> (tifkod) is, you shall appoint each one of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tifkod</i> can meant to count.

Verse 23

BEHIND THE TABERNACLE. <i>Achare</i> (behind) means the same as <i>achore</i> (behind).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Achare</i> literally means after.

However, it appears to me that its meaning is, and they had already spread a cloth all of blue over the screen covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>u-fareshu</i> (and shall spread) is a pluperfect and is to be rendered, and they had already spread. According to this interpretation, the blue cover was placed on the ark, and the <i>tachash</i> (sealskin) covering was placed over the blue covering.</i> If the blue cover was used in order to glorify the ark, then the first interpretation appears correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Blue is a royal color. Hence it stands to reason that if it was placed on the ark, it should be visible.</i> The <i>tachash</i> covering served to protect [the ark] from the rain and the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the blue covering, which served as a decoration.</i>
AND SHALL SET THE STAVES THEREOF. Note, they removed the staves until the ark was covered.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ex. 25:15 the staves were never to be removed from the ark. I.E. believes that the staves were momentarily removed while the ark was being covered. Hence Scripture states, and shall set the staves thereof (back in place).</i> Some say that they shall set the staves upon the shoulders of the bearers.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>and they shall set the staves thereof</i> is, they shall set the staves upon the bearers of the ark. Thus our verse does not imply that the staves were ever removed from the ark. See <i>Tosafot Yoma</i> 72a.</i>

Verse 7

AND UPON THE TABLE OF SHOWBREAD. To teach us that there were other tables there<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture identifies the table.</i> for the use of the meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For the use of the sacrificial meat.</i> Furthermore, the showbread which was placed upon this table was not removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is referred to as the table of showbread.</i>

Verse 8

A CLOTH OF SCARLET. Look. There were two cloth coverings<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">One of blue (v. 7) and one of scarlet (v. 8).</i> plus a covering of skin upon the table. There were similarly a screen covering,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>parokhot ha-masakh</i> (v. 5).</i> a blue cloth covering, and a covering of skin over the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> A cloth covering and a cover of skin were over the menorah.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 9 and 10.</i>

Verse 9



Verse 10

AND SHALL PUT IT UPON A BAR. For it did not have any staves.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">By which to carry it.</i> It is similar to <i>and they bore it upon a pole</i> (Num. 13:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">There too the grapes, which of course did not have any staves, were placed on a bar in order to be carried. Weiser suggests that I.E. believed that bar is to be interpreted as two bars, in the same manner that pole is to be interpreted as poles.</i>

Verse 11

AND UPON THE GOLDEN ALTAR THEY SHALL SPREAD. Another cloth<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>beged acher</i>. Some emend to one cloth (<i>beged echad</i>) (Filwarg).</i> and a covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to a covering of <i>tachash</i> (sealskin).</i>[15.] OF COVERING THE HOLY FURNITURE, AND ALL THE HOLY VESSELS.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s comment is misplaced. It belongs in verse 15.</i> The ark, the table, the menorah, the altars, and all the utensils of ministry such as the knives, the spoons, and the plates.

Verse 12



Verse 13

AND THEY SHALL TAKE AWAY THE ASHES. It means, and they shall take away the ashes from the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>deshen</i> means ashes. Thus <i>ve-dishenu</i> literally means, and they shall ash. This might be taken to mean, and they shall put on ashes. Hence I.E.’s interpretation that <i>ve-dishenu</i> means, and they shall remove the ashes.</i>

Verse 14



Verse 15

THESE THINGS ARE THE BURDEN OF THE SONS OF KOHATH IN THE TENT OF MEETING. For they did not carry the tent and the tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture states, <i>These things are the burden</i>, because they did not do any carrying.</i>

Verse 16

AND THE CHARGE OF. <i>U-fekudat</i> (and the charge of) is related to the word <i>pakid</i> (overseer).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">One who assigns tasks.</i>
THE OIL FOR THE LIGHT. Some say that Eleazar carried oil for one night’s light and similarly the continual meal offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The daily continual meal offering. See <i>Yerushalmi, Sabbath</i> 10:13. Eleazar carried oil for the lighting in his right hand and the sweet incense in his left hand, while the continual meal offering hung from his arm.</i> However, I believe that Eleazar was in charge of giving <i>the oil for the light</i>, that is, of the utensil containing the oil for the light, and similarly the vessel containing the anointing oil and the vessel containing the sweet incense, to the children of Kohath.
[HE SHALL HAVE THE CHARGE OF ALL THE TABERNACLE.] Scripture states this because Eleazar had charge over the tabernacle along with his brother Ithamar.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">If Eleazar was in charge of the entire tabernacle, why does Scripture tell us that he was in charge of the oil, the sweet incense, and the meal offering? Hence I.E.’s comments.</i> However, Eleazar alone had charge over the oil, the sweet incense, and the meal offering because of his great status.

Verse 17

[UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON.] Scripture states this because Aaron and his sons were commanded to take heed that the sons of Kohath do not come to the penalty of excision (<i>karet</i>).

Verse 18

The command <i>Cut ye not off</i> was given to Moses, Aaron and his sons.

Verse 19

THAT THEY MAY LIVE. That their lives may be extended.
AND NOT DIE. By excision. The meaning of our verse is that the family of the Kohathites will be rewarded if they observe and will be punished if they do not. Without the phrase <i>and not die</i>, our verse could be taken to imply that they will not be punished.
AND APPOINT THEM.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-samu otam</i>, which literally means, and put them. This can be interpreted as referring to the <i>kohanim</i>. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> The ark, the table, the menorah, and the altars.
EVERY ONE TO HIS SERVICE. This refers to the holy vessels.
AND TO HIS BURDEN. To be carried on the shoulder.

Verse 20

BUT THEY SHALL NOT GO IN. The Kohathites shall not go in to the tent of meeting to see the holy things as they are being covered. The meaning of <i>ke-vala et ha-kodesh</i> (the holy things as they are being covered) is, when the structure is taken down, the veil of the curtain is removed and the ark is revealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the meaning of <i>the holy things as they are being covered</i> is, when the holy (i.e., the tabernacle) is taken down.</i> Others say that the meaning of <i>ke-vala</i> is, when they are being covered. Thus the meaning of <i>ke-vala et ha-kodesh</i> is, when they cover the ark in order to carry it.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ke-vala</i> means when it is covered. The word <i>bala</i> means swallowed. Thus <i>ke-vala</i> literally means when he swallows, i.e., when he covers.</i> This interpretation is more plausible than the first one. Now there are two prohibitions. One, not to touch the holy vessels-they are to be carried only by staves. Two, the Kohathites shall not see the holy things.

Verse 21



Verse 22

TAKE THE SUM. <i>Naso</i> (take the sum) is an infinitive. It is like <i>zakhor</i> (remember) in <i>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy</i> (Ex. 20:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Which is an infinitive too.</i> The meaning of <i>naso</i> is, take the sum.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, even though <i>naso</i> is an infinitive, it has the meaning of an imperative. The same applies to <i>zakhor</i>.</i>
ALSO. Because he had already counted the Kohathites.

Verse 23



Verse 24

IN SERVING. To put up the tabernacle, to make the showbread, to slaughter, and to guard.
AND IN BEARING BURDENS. <i>Le-massa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, sin, alef</i>.</i> (bearing burdens) is an infinitive. Similarly <i>le-massa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, sin, ayin</i>.</i> (causing to set forward) in <i>and for causing the camps to set forward</i> (Num. 10:2). The forms of verbs change.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-massa</i> in our verse is vocalized <i>kamatz, pattach</i>. <i>Le-massa</i> in Num. 10:2 is vocalized <i>pattach, pattach</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 25

AND THE COVERING OF SEALSKIN THAT IS ABOVE IT. Scripture is being brief, for it does not mention the ramskin covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Which was above the sealskin covering. See Ex. 26:14.</i> Some say that the two coverings were attached.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the covering of sealskin includes the ramskin covering.</i>

Verse 26

AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF THEIR SERVICE. Such as tables, pegs, and cords.
AND WHATSOEVER THERE MAY BE TO DO WITH THEM. The instruments of service, or the tabernacle and the altar.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

AS FOR THE SONS OF MERARI. Scripture does not mention that they were counted, for this section<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 29-37.</i> is connected to the one above.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 21-28.

THE WORK OF SERVICE. This is to be understood as I have already explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In his comments on verse 15, I.E. hints that the term <i>work of service</i> applies to the carrying of the tent and the tabernacle, which was the work assigned to the sons of Gershon and Merari, while the term <i>the work of bearing burdens</i> refers to the work done by the sons of Kohath (Weiser).</i> Now the meaning of <i>All those that were numbered</i> (v. 46) is, all those from thirty years old that were numbered.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our verse is a continuation of verse 46.</i>

Verse 48



Verse 49

EVERY ONE. The reference is to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
TO HIS SERVICE, AND TO HIS BURDEN. Hence <i>and his numbered</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>u-fekudav</i>. The singular <i>u-fekudav</i> is employed because the terms which precede it (<i>avodato</i>, his service, and <i>masa’o</i>, his burden) are i n the singular. It should be noted that J.P.S. renders <i>u-fekudav</i> as <i>they were also numbered</i>.</i> follows. The section <i>put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead</i> (Num. 5:2) follows, because God’s presence was in the camps of Israel when they journeyed and when they rested.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hence all those who were unclean had to leave the camp.</i>

Chapter 5



Verse 1



Verse 2

EVERY LEPER, AND EVERY ONE THAT HATH AN ISSUE,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>zav</i>. A <i>zav</i> or a <i>zavah</i> is a person who has an abnormal discharge from the genital organs.</i> AND WHOSOEVER IS UNCLEAN BY THE DEAD. These are states of uncleanliness that last for seven days. They also render others unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For the uncleanliness of the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zavah</i>, see Lev. 15:1-28. For the uncleanliness of those who come into contact with the dead, see Num. 19:1- 22.</i> Therefore a person who had a seminal omission does not leave the camp.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The camp discussed in our chapter, i.e., the camp of the entire people of Israel. I.E. comments thus because one who has a seminal mission is obligated to leave a camp of soldiers who go to war.

I will explain this in its proper place.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 23:10. For another interpretation, see Weiser.</i>

Verse 3

The section that begins with <i>When a man or woman</i> [<i>shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass against the Lord</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 6-10.</i> follows the previous chapter<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 1-4.</i> because leprosy and unclean issue<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>zav</i>.</i> are brought about by trespassing against the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">They are punishments for sin. See <i>Arakin</i> 16b.</i> The reason this section is repeated<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The material in verses 5-10 repeats what has already been stated in Lev. 5:20-26.</i> is that the Torah wants to mention <i>but if the man have no kinsman</i> (v. 8).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This law is not mentioned in Lev 5:20-26.</i>

Verse 9



Verse 10

AND EVERY MAN’S HALLOWED THINGS SHALL BE HIS. Its meaning is that they belong to the one who hallows them. He may give them to any <i>kohen</i> that he wants to.

IF ANY MAN’S WIFE GO ASIDE. <i>Tisteh</i> means will go aside from the right way.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>tisteh</i> means to go aside.

CARNALLY. <i>Shikhvat zera</i> (carnally) refers to carnal laying. It is called <i>shikhvat zera</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, laying of seed.</i> because its purpose is for seed.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Its purpose is for ejaculation (Weiser).

COME. Come upon his mind.

Verse 15

BRING. Against her will.
FOR HER. <i>Aleha</i> (for her) means with her or because of her.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The usual meaning of <i>aleha</i> is, upon her. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
BARLEY MEAL. Our rabbis said, she acted like a beast, let her bring the food of a beast.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah, Sotah</i> 2:1.</i> A free-will meal offering consists of pure wheat flower so that the celebrant will be remembered for good. However, this meal offering recalls a sin, if a sin was committed. Hence it is an inferior offering and consists of barley without oil and without frankincense.

Verse 16

AND THE PRIEST SHALL BRING HER NEAR. <i>Her</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>otah</i>.</i> refers to the meal offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Not the woman. The word <i>otah</i> literally means her. However, it also means it.</i>

Verse 18

AND LET THE HAIR OF THE WOMAN’S HEAD GO LOOSE. <i>Para</i> (go loose) means he shall uncover.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">According to this opinion the meaning of our verse is, <i>and he shall uncover (u-fara) the hair of the woman</i>.</i> However, I believe that it means he shall take out the hair of the woman, which was covered, and let it go loose.
THE WATER OF BITTERNESS. It is my opinion that the word <i>me</i> (water) is in the construct<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">With a missing word.</i> and the word <i>ha-marim</i> is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Describing the missing word.</i> If so, then its secret is known.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">We know what word is missing. According to I.E. the phrase <i>me ha- marim</i> is short for <i>me ha-sammim ha-marim</i> (the water containing the bitter ingredient). See <i>Sotah</i> 20a.</i> It is also possible that the waters were so called because of their ultimate taste.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The waters were not yet bitter. They only turned bitter at the end.

Thus what Scripture means is that the one who was ultimately naked was stripped.</i> <i>And the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter</i> (v. 24) is proof of this, for this verse indicates that the <i>oaths</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in verse 19. The waters turned bitter after the oaths were dissolved in it.</i> which <i>they that cause the curses</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The curses come about through her false swearing.</i> refers to, will make the sweet waters bitter.
The word <i>ha-me’arerim</i> (that causeth the curse) is a <i>pi’el</i>. It is like the word <i>erarah</i> (cursed) in <i>which the Lord hath cursed</i> (Gen. 5:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">It too is a <i>pi’el</i>. The root <i>alef, resh, resh</i> usually comes in the <i>kal</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 19

[SHALL CAUSE HER TO SWEAR.] Its meaning is that the woman shall answer, <i>Amen, Amen</i>.
IF NO MAN HAVE LAIN WITH THEE. Its meaning is, if another man has not forced himself upon you.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>If no man have lain with thee</i> cannot be taken literally because we are dealing with a married women. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
AND IF THOU HAST NOT GONE ASIDE. Willingly. <i>Satit</i> means you have gone aside and committed an unclean act.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>satit</i> is short for <i>satit tume’ah</i>.</i> It is similar to <i>thou shalt not build it of hewn stones</i> (Ex. 20:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20:25 literally reads, <i>you shall not build them uncut stones</i>.

BE THOU FREE. The meaning of <i>hinnaki</i> is, be thou free.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hinnaki</i> is an imperative. It literally means free yourself. However, it cannot mean that here, for it is not in the power of the woman to free herself.

THE MEMORIAL-PART THEREOF.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads <i>azkaratah</i>. This literally means her memorial. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> That which served as her memorial, for good or bad in accordance with her deeds.

Verse 27

AND HAVE ACTED UNFAITHFULLY. <i>Va-timal ma’al</i> (and have acted unfaithfully) is to be understood here as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 5:15.</i> It refers to something covered.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. on Lev. 5:15, the phrase <i>li-me’ol ma’al</i> means to remove a cover (<i>me’il</i>), to uncover that which should remain covered. <i>Va-time’ol ma’al</i> thus means, and have committed an act of treachery.</i>

Verse 28

AND SHALL CONCEIVE SEED. God will give her seed in recompense for the shame which befell her.

Verse 30



Verse 31

SHALL BEAR HER INIQUITY. If she was defiled.
Our verse states, <i>And the man shall be clear from iniquity</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">If the woman is exonerated and he has relations with her.</i> For if a spirit of jealousy came upon him she is prohibited to him. He is not allowed to be with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">If a man suspects his wife of adultery, he is prohibited from having sexual relations with her until she is exonerated.</i> If he sleeps with her, he is guilty of sin. Some say that the section dealing with the Nazirite follows the section dealing with the wife who is accused of adultery because if the latter was not defiled, then she will have a son who is a Nazirite. However, I believe that the chapter dealing with the Nazirite follows [the chapter dealing with the wife who is accused of adultery] because it lays down the law regarding a female Nazirite who is the reverse of the unfaithful wife. Now wine<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Which the Nazirite forswears.</i> causes most sins. Furthermore, a woman who does not fix her hair<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The Nazirite is prohibited from cutting hair.</i> does not seek sexual relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the female Nazirite who abstains from wine and does not cut her hair is the reverse of the unfaithful wife who drinks wine and does cut her hair.</i>

Chapter 6



Verse 1



Verse 2

SHALL CLEARLY UTTER A VOW. The word <i>yafli</i> means to set aside. On the other hand, it might mean doing something out of the ordinary,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>yafli</i> is related to the word <i>pele</i> (wonder).</i> for most people follow their lusts.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">But this person took an oath to separate himself from the pleasure of drinking. Hence what he did was wondrous.</i>
THE VOW OF A NAZIRITE. <i>Neder nazir</i> means an oath to be a Nazirite, for the word <i>nazir</i> (Nazirite) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nazir</i> modifies the person who takes the oath, for according to I.E. the meaning of <i>neder nazir</i> is to be a Nazirite person. See Weiser.</i> The word <i>ve-yenazeru</i> (that they separate) (Lev. 22:13) is related to it.
[TO CONSECRATE HIMSELF UNTO THE LORD.]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>le-hazir la-Adonai</i>. This literally means to separate himself unto the Lord. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> To distance himself from lust. He does this in order to serve God, for wine destroys reason and the proper service of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>le-nazir la-Adonai</i> means to separate (himself from wine) in order to serve God.</i> I will hint at a secret in the chapter that opens with <i>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies</i> (Deut. 23:10).

Verse 3

[HE SHALL ABSTAIN FROM WINE AND STRONG DRINK.] Its meaning is, if he took a vow to be a Nazirite and holy, then he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. According to the transmitters of tradition, <i>shekhar</i> (strong drink) is aged wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>shekhar</i> refers to old wine while <i>yayin</i> refers to young wine. See Targum and Rashi.</i> Others say that <i>shekhar</i> is to be taken literally; it refers to any drink that intoxicates a person.
[HE SHALL DRINK NO VINEGAR OF WINE…NEITHER SHALL HE DRINK ANY LIQUOR OF GRAPES, NOR EAT FRESH GRAPES.] This explains the oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Taken by the Nazirite.</i> He must distance himself from anything connected to wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he must not eat any grapes or grape products even if they are not intoxicating.</i> In the account of the wife of Manoah,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The mother of Samson.</i> Scripture states, <i>and eat not any unclean thing</i> (Jud. 13:7). <i>She</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Samson’s mother.</i> <i>may not eat of any thing that cometh of the grape-vine</i> (Jud. 13:14).
LIQUOR OF. The word <i>mishrat</i> (liquor of) is not found elsewhere in Scripture. The <i>tav</i> indicates that the word is feminine and is in the construct. <i>Mishrat anavim</i> refers to anything that has been mashed with grapes. Others say that <i>mishrat anavim</i> refers to a cooked drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Made from grapes.</i>

Verse 4

PRESSED GRAPES. The word <i>chartzannim</i> (pressed grapes) is not found anywhere else in Scripture. The same applies to the word <i>zag</i> (grape-stone). The commentaries tells us that <i>chartzannim</i> refers to the outer skin of the grape and <i>zag</i> to the pits. Others say the reverse.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Nazir</i> 34b.</i> According to these interpretations, <i>me-chartzannim</i> (from the pressed grapes)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>me-chartzannim ad zag</i> (from the pressed grapes even to the grape-stone).</i> is connected to <i>nothing that is made of the grape-vine</i>. The meaning of our verse is that the Nazirite shall eat nothing made from the grapevine, that is, from these two things.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The outer skin and the pit of the grape.</i>

Verse 5

HE SHALL LET THE LOCKS OF THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD GROW LONG. The word <i>gaddel</i> (grow) is a <i>pi’el</i> infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture employs an infinitive with the meaning of a third person imperfect (<i>yegaddel</i>).</i> The meaning of <i>gaddel</i> is, he shall grow.

Verse 6

THAT HE CONSECRATETH. The word <i>hazziro</i> (that he consecrateth) is a <i>hifil</i> infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It is not a perfect; if it were, it would be vocalized <i>hiziro</i>.</i>
A DEAD BODY.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>nefesh met</i>.</i> The word <i>met</i> (dead) is an adjective describing body (<i>nefesh</i>). On the other hand, the word <i>guf</i> (body) is missing from our text.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, the word <i>met</i> is describing the word <i>guf</i>. Our verse reads, <i>nefesh met</i>.</i>

Verse 7

FOR HIS FATHER, OR FOR HIS MOTHER. And certainly not for his wife, his daughter, and others. Some say that the word <i>nazir</i> (Nazirite) is related to the word <i>nezer</i> (crown). <i>Because his consecration</i> (nezer) <i>unto God is upon his head</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders this clause, “Because the crown of (<i>nezer</i>) his God is upon his head.”</i> is proof of this. This interpretation is not farfetched.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">It is not <i>aggadic</i>.</i> Note that most people are slaves to worldly lusts. The true king, the one who has a crown, the one who wears the royal diadem, is the person who is free from this lust.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the term <i>nazir</i>, the one who wears the crown.</i>

Verse 8



Verse 9

VERY SUDDENLY. The words <i>peta</i> and <i>pitom</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. renders <i>peta pitom</i> as very suddenly. According to I.E. the literal meaning of <i>peto pitom</i> is suddenly, suddenly.</i> are close in meaning. The same applies to <i>admat afar</i> (dust of the earth) (Dan. 12:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>adamah</i> and <i>afar</i> mean the same. See I.E. on Gen. 8:11 (Vol. 1, p. 115.</i>
AND HE DEFILE. The corpse will defile him.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>and he defile his consecrated head</i> does not mean and the Nazirite will defile himself, but that the corpse will defile the Nazirite.</i>
IN THE DAY OF HIS CLEANSING. By the waters of purification,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 19:1-22.</i> for he was defiled by a corpse.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>.</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11

ONE FOR A SIN-OFFERING AND THE OTHER FOR A BURNT-OFFERING. Its secret was explained by the sages. They said that the reward of sin is sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abot</i> 4:2. I.E.’s point is that the Nazirite must have been guilty of some sin for uncleanliness to have befallen him during his period of Naziriteship (Filwarg).</i>
FOR THAT HE SINNED BY REASON OF THE BODY.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>nefesh</i>. J.P.S. renders it as dead.</i> The reference is to a dead body. Compare the word <i>nefesh</i> (body) in <i>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for a body</i> (Lev. 19:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>la-nefesh</i>. J.P.S. renders it as the dead.</i> If the sin referred to a sin committed against his very own body,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Eleazar Ha-Kappar, the Nazirite sins by abstaining from wine. See <i>Nazir</i> 19:a; <i>Nedarim</i> 10:2.</i> then Scripture would not command him to return to his sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">To start the days of his Nazirite term anew (v. 12).</i>

Verse 12

AND HE SHALL CONSECRATE UNTO THE LORD THE DAYS OF HIS NAZIRITESHIP. All the days that he vowed to be a Nazirite. He shall now begin to count them.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">He shall now start to count them anew.</i>
BECAUSE HIS CONSECRATION WAS DEFILED. For he vowed to be a Nazirite for a fixed number of days in succession without anything intervening and breaking them up.

Verse 13

FULFILLED. <i>Melot</i> (fulfilled) is an infinitive. Its final root letter is an <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>mem, lamed, alef</i>.</i> It is conjugated like a word that has a <i>heh</i> as a final root letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the ending <i>ot</i>. Words that end in an <i>alef</i> end in an <i>o</i> in the infinitive. Thus the infinitive of <i>mem, lamed, alef</i> should be <i>melo</i>.</i> It is like the word <i>kero’ot</i> (call)<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Which comes from the root <i>kof, resh, alef</i>, but whose infinitive form follows the paradigm of a word ending in a <i>heh</i>.</i> in <i>that thou didst call us</i> (Jud. 8:1).
HE SHALL BRING IT.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>oto</i>. <i>Oto</i> can mean him or it.

Literally, them (<i>otam</i>). However, in order to makes sense of the verse we must render <i>otam</i> as themselves. Similarly, <i>oto</i> (him) in our verse is to be rendered as himself.</i> Or <i>yavi oto</i> means that the <i>kohen</i> shall bring him<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Nazirite if he refuses to bring his offering.</i> against his will by commanding that he be forced to bring his sacrifice.

Verse 14

ONE HE-LAMB. A male, as is the law regarding all burnt offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 1:3.</i>
ONE EWE-LAMB. A female, as is the law with all sin offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 4:27-29.</i>

Verse 15



Verse 16

HIS SIN-OFFERING. The sin offering is mentioned first<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse, even though the burnt offering was offered first.</i> because it was mentioned last,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 14.</i> for this is Hebrew style.

Verse 18

THE HAIR OF. The Hebrew word for <i>hair of</i> is vocalized in two ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Se’ar</i> (<i>sheva, pattach</i>) in our verse, and <i>sa’ar</i> (<i>pattach, pattach</i>) in Is. 7:20.</i>

Verse 19

WHEN IT IS SODDEN.

This literally means the shoulder cooked. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
AFTER HE HATH SHAVEN HIS CONSECRATED HEAD. This is a sign that the <i>kodesh hu</i> (this is holy) (v. 20) refers to the word <i>shoulder</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> for that is the main organ that is being waved. On the other hand, the word <i>hu</i> (this)<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>kodesh hu</i>.</i> may refer to all that is waved.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Even though <i>hu</i> is a singular. Thus <i>kodesh hu</i> refers to all that is being waved.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

[BESIDE THAT FOR WHICH HIS MEANS SUFFICE.] It means that he is obligated to give in accordance with his wealth. He is also obligated to give in accordance with the days of his vow, whether they are few or whether they are many.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The additional offerings brought by the Nazirite are contingent upon the length of his vow; the longer the vow period, the more sacrifices to be brought.</i> The chapter dealing with the blessings of the <i>kohanim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 22-26.</i> follows the chapter dealing with the Nazirite because, after concluding the laws of the Nazirite who is holy, Scripture mentions the laws of the <i>kohanim</i> who are holy. Those who contradict Rabbinic tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that the <i>kohen</i> used this blessing to bless all who brought a gift. They claim that the blessing of the <i>kohanim</i> follows the law of the Nazirite because the latter concludes with “beside that which the means of the celebrant suffice.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>beside that for which his means suffice</i>.</i> However, the truth is in keeping with the tradition of our sages of blessed memory.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis teach that this is a blessing to be given to all of Israel.

This portion<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 24-26.</i> was written because God commanded Aaron to bless the people when the tabernacle was erected. Scripture there<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In Lev. 9:22.</i> mentions, <i>nesi’at kappayim</i> (the lifting of the hands),<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbinic term for the blessing given by the <i>kohanim</i>.</i> for the word <i>kappayim</i> means the same as <i>yadayim</i> (hands).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 9:22 reads: <i>Va-yissa et yadav</i> (lifted up his hands). According to I.E. this means the same as <i>va-yissa et kapav</i>. Thus Lev. 9:22 refers to what the rabbis call <i>nisi’at kappayim</i>, that is, the blessing given by the <i>kohanim</i>.</i> However, the term <i>yadayim</i> is a more general term.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">It takes in the entire hand, while <i>kappayim</i> technically refers to the fingers and their sockets (Weiser).</i>

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

THE LORD BLESS THEE. The Lord increase your life and your wealth.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. a blessing means an increase in the good. See his comments on Gen. 2:3 (Vol. 1, p. 50).</i>
AND KEEP THEE. God will protect what he has increased so that no one steals it.

Verse 25

THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON THEE. Its meaning is the same as <i>In the light of the king’s countenance is life</i> (Prov. 16:15). It means may God make his face to shine upon you when you ask something of Him and at the time that you make the request. May God accept you and may His will be to immediately fulfill your request.
[AND BE GRACIOUS TO THEE.] If you make a request of God in a time of trouble, may He be gracious to you. <i>Ve-yechunekka</i> (and be gracious to thee) is similar to <i>channuni</i> (have pity) in <i>have pity upon me, O ye</i> (Job. 19:21) and <i>chanan</i> (graciously given) in <i>The children whom God hath graciously given</i> (Gen. 33:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. this should be rendered, <i>The children whom God out His pity hath given</i>.</i> <i>Ve-yechunekka</i> comes from the same root as <i>chanan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Which I.E. renders, to have pity. See I.E. on Ex. 22:26 (Vol. 2, p. 490).</i>

Verse 26

THE LORD LIFT UP HIS COUNTENANCE UPON THEE. The reverse of <i>I will hide Mine eyes from you</i> (Is. 1:15). As I have already explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">It isn’t clear where I.E. made this comment earlier.</i> its meaning is, wherever you go My face shall be lifted up to you.
AND GIVE THEE PEACE. Its meaning is similar to, <i>no evil</i> — from stones, from evil animals, from any enemy — <i>touch thee</i> (Job. 5:19).

Verse 27

SO SHALL THEY PUT MY NAME. Its meaning is similar to <i>to set His name there</i> (Deut. 14:24),<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">It means that “the place” will be sanctified because it shall be called by God’s name.</i> that is, the children of Israel be sanctified by God’s name. Or it means that when they shall mention My name over the children of Israel [I will bless them], for God’s revered and awe-inspiring name is found in each one of the three verses.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Hence this is what <i>So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel</i> refers to.</i>
AND I WILL BLESS THEM. It is possible that the <i>mem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mem</i> of <i>va-avarekhem</i> is a pronominal suffix meaning them.</i> of <i>avarekhem</i> (I will bless them) refers to the <i>kohanim</i> who utter the blessing. It means they will bless Israel, and I will bless those who bless.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them</i> is: the <i>kohanim</i> shall bless Israel and I will bless the <i>kohanim</i>.</i> It is also possible that the <i>mem</i> of <i>avarekhem</i> refers to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>and I will bless them</i> means and I will bless Israel.</i> Its meaning is, if the <i>kohanim</i> bless Israel, then I will bless Israel; that is, I will fulfill the blessing of the <i>kohanim</i>. In my opinion, the <i>mem</i> of <i>avarekhem</i> refers to all of them, the <i>kohanim</i> and the Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the meaning of <i>and I will bless them</i> is, I will bless both Israel and the <i>kohanim</i>.</i>

Chapter 7



Verse 1

[AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD MADE AN END OF SETTING UP THE TABERNACLE.] Moses made an end to the setting up of the tabernacle after the blessing of the <i>kohanim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">After the <i>kohanim</i> blessed Israel. See Num. 6:24-26; Lev. 9:22.</i> as this was how events unfolded.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 7 follows the blessing of the <i>kohanim</i> at the end of chapter 6.</i> On the day that Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 9:22.</i> the dedication of the tabernacle began.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse.</i> The verse <i>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle</i> is proof of the words of our sages, that Moses took the tabernacle down, raised it up and took it down again, and erected it again throughout the seven days of dedication to train the <i>kohanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis, <i>had made an end of setting up the tabernacle</i> indicates that the tabernacle had been set up and taken down a number of times. See I.E. on Ex. 40:2 and the notes thereto (Vol. 2, p. 754). It should be noted that I.E. there rejects the opinion that Moses erected and took down the tabernacle during the seven days of dedication.</i> For the meaning of <i>and sanctified them</i> is that he sanctified them [the furniture, the altar, and the vessels] by the sprinkling of the blood<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 29:21; Ex. 29:35-7; Lev. 8:30.</i> during the seven days of dedication.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">When the tabernacle was set up and taken down.</i>
AND THE ALTAR AND ALL THE VESSELS THEREOF. This is connected to <i>on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle</i> also applies to <i>and the altar</i>.</i> It means that he set the altar up in its place.
AND ALL THE VESSELS THEREOF, AND HAD ANOINTED THEM. With the anointing oil
AND SANCTIFIED THEM. With blood. Scripture mentions the altar because of its dedication.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i>, the altar is included in <i>the furniture thereof</i>. Hence I.E. points out the altar is singled out for special mention because it had a special dedication. <br>According to I.E. sex is one of the things that creates a barrier between man and God (<i>Yesod Mora</i>, chapter 7, pp. 107 and 108). The Nazirite is an individual who takes a vow to abstain from wine and haircutting. I.E. connects wine and hair to sexuality. He believes that most sexual taboos are violated because the transgressor has imbibed wine. As to the prohibition of cutting the hair, I.E. writes, “A woman who does not fix her hair does not seek to engage in sexual relationships” (Num. 5:31). He similarly notes that the Torah states that “a razor shall not come upon the head of a Nazirite so that he does not make himself attractive to women.” (<i>Yesod Mora</i>, p. 62).</i>

Verse 2

THAT THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL…OFFERED. Scripture employs a general term.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse tells us in general terms that the princes brought an offering. Unlike the offerings brought by the princes when the altar was dedicated (verses 12-83), Scripture does not list the offerings prince by prince.</i> Its meaning is that they brought their offering to the Lord before the opening of the tabernacle.

Verse 3

COVERED. The word <i>tzav</i> (covered) here is similar to the word <i>tzabbim</i> (Utters) in <i>and in litters, and upon mules</i> (Is. 66:20). The reference is to a type of ox that pulls wagons.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation, here <i>eglot tzav</i> (covered wagons) means wagons pulled by a <i>tzav</i>. This commentary renders Is. 66:20, <i>and upon oxen and mules</i>.</i> Others say that <i>eglot tzav</i> (covered wagons) refers to a wagon that is overloaded and that <i>tzav</i> is connected to the word <i>tzavah</i> (swell) (Num. 5:21). However, this is farfetched.
[AND TWELVE OXEN.] I have already explained in my work <i>Moznayim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A work on grammar.</i> that the <i>mem</i> in <i>shenem asar</i> (twelve) remains both in the absolute<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in the word two (<i>shenayim</i>).</i> and in the construct.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In the phrase <i>shenem asar</i> (twelve). When a word ending in a <i>mem</i> is connected to another word, the <i>mem</i> is dropped. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The meaning of <i>shenem asar</i> (twelve) is two (<i>shenayim</i>) and ten (<i>eser</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>shenem asar</i> is short for <i>shenayim ve-asar</i>, Hence the change in the vowel, <i>shenem</i> rather than <i>shenayim</i>.</i> The word <i>shenem</i> is connected to <i>aser</i> for purposes of brevity. The same applies to <i>shelosh elleh</i> (these three) (Ex. 21:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shelosh</i> is in the construct with <i>elleh</i>. Otherwise the phrase would be written <i>shalosh elleh</i>.

[13. AND HIS OFFERING.] Scripture reads, <i>and his offering</i> because Scripture had already stated, <i>And he that presented</i> [<i>his offering</i>] (v. 12). The <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-korbano</i> (and his offering) means, and this was his offering. Scripture writes with regard to the second day, <i>hikriv et korbano</i> (he offered his offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.

ON THE SEVENTH DAY. Some say that Elishama the son of Ammihud presented his offering on the Sabbath.

ON THE ELEVENTH DAY. I have already explained in my work <i>moznayim</i> why this number<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ashte asar</i> (eleven).</i> differs [from the other numbers].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">All the other teens are written by adding the one number to ten. For example, 12 is written <i>shenem</i> (2) <i>asar</i>; 13, <i>sheloshah</i> (3) <i>asar</i> (10); etc. However, the word for eleven in our verse is <i>ashte asar</i> and not <i>ahad</i> (1) <i>asar</i> (10).</i> The word <i>ashte</i> in (<i>ashte asar</i>, eleven) is similar to the word <i>eshtonotav</i> (his thoughts) (Ps. 146:4). It (<i>ashte</i>) refers to that which a person’s thoughts give birth to. The number ten, as it were begets [eleven, etc.]. This is a great secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., “Ten is the foundation of all sums, for all sums that follow ten are made up of a part or parts of ten, or come into being by doubling ten, multiplying ten, or a combination of the two” (<i>The Secret of the Torah</i>, p. 163).</i> Rabbi Jonah the Sephardi<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah ibn Janach, the eleventh-century grammarian.</i> says that <i>ashte asar</i> is short for <i>al shete asar</i>. Its meaning is, the number that precedes twelve.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ashte asar</i> means eleven.</i> Now Rabbi Jonah made two great mistakes. One, contrary to his words, the number twelve is beyond (<i>al</i>) the number eleven.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>al</i> means above, not before. Hence if <i>ashte asar</i> is short for <i>al shetem asar</i>, then its meaning is, not before 12 but beyond 12.</i> <i>From twenty years old and upward</i> (va-ma’alah) (Num. 1:3) is proof of the aforementioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-ma’alah</i> and <i>al</i> come from the same root. We thus see that <i>al</i> means upward or beyond, not before.</i> His second mistake is that if the word <i>ashte</i> is short for <i>al shete</i>, then the text should have read <i>ashne asar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Because the word for 12 is <i>shenem asar</i>.</i> not <i>ashte asar</i>. For <i>ashte</i> is in the feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Jonah, <i>ashte</i> is short for <i>shetem asar</i>. <i>Shetem asar</i> is feminine. Now <i>yom</i> is masculine. Why would Scripture employ a feminine?</i> <i>Ashte</i> is therefore one word.

[AND WHEN MOSES WENT IN.] It is likely that the beginning of God’s word to Moses [in the tabernacle], which is what <i>And the Lord called unto Moses</i> (Lev. 1:1) refers to, was uttered when the dedication of the tabernacle was completed. All the grammarians say that the word <i>middabber</i> (speaking) in <i>speaking unto him</i> is a <i>hitpa’el</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">So too Rashi.</i> with the <i>tav</i> swallowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">By the <i>dallet</i>. In other words, <i>middabber</i> is short for <i>mitdabber</i>.</i> However, in my opinion <i>middadbber</i> is an infinitive. It is similar to the word <i>dabber</i> (speak)<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Which is an infinitive.</i> in <i>behold, I cannot speak</i> (Jer. 1:5). The <i>mem</i> prefixed to <i>middabber</i> is in place of the word <i>min</i>, as is the rule in the Hebrew language.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mem</i> placed in front of a word has the meaning of from. I.E. renders <i>va-yishma et ha-kol middabber elav</i> (then he heard the voice speaking unto him) as, then he heard the voice of the One who spoke to him.</i>
The meaning of <i>va-yishma</i> (then he heard) is that only Moses heard the voice. Anyone in the tent of meeting outside of the curtain did not hear the voice. The following is also correct: God made Moses’ ear supersensitive<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">So that Moses heard what others did not</i> as he added to the sight of Elisha’s young man (II Kings 6:17). Similarly <i>Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam</i> (Num. 22:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Which, according to I.E., means God made his eyes more sensitive than the eyes of other people.</i>

SPEAK UNTO AARON. For he is obligated to fulfill the commandment of lighting the lamps.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 27:21.</i>
IN FRONT OF THE CANDLESTICK. This explains <i>to give light</i> (he’ir) <i>over against it</i> (Ex. 25:37).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>to give light over against it</i> is, shall give light in front of the candlestick.</i> Now the word <i>he’ir</i> (give light)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In Ex. 25:37.</i> is transitive. It is similar to the word <i>ta’ir</i> (dost light) in <i>For Thou dost light my light</i> (Ps. 18:29). However, this is not the case with the word <i>ya’iru</i> (shall give light)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse. According to I.E., <i>ya’iru</i> (shall give light) is intransitive and means shall shine, not shall shine upon. I.E. renders our clause, <i>shall shine in front of the candlestick</i>.</i> and the word <i>he’irah</i> (did shine) in <i>and the earth did shine</i> (Ezek. 43:2). This section<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 1-4.</i> follows<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The statement telling us that God spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting.</i> in order to teach that God’s word also came at night, for the light was to burn in the tabernacle and was not to be extinguished.

Verse 4

AND THIS WAS THE WORK OF THE CANDLESTICK. Scripture teaches that no such menorah was ever seen.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture describes the menorah because it was a unique work of art. The menorah had already been described in Ex. 25:31-40. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
BEATEN. I have already explained the meaning of <i>mikshah</i> (beaten).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Mikshah</i> means equal” (I.E. on Ex. 25:31, Vol. 2, p. 547). According to I.E. the various parts of the menorah were of equal size.</i>
THE BASE THEREOF. This refers to the shaft upon which it stood,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The shaft, to which the menorah’s branches were attached.</i> for Scripture explicitly states, <i>its base, and its shaft</i> (Ex. 25:31).
THE FLOWERS THEREOF. The meaning of the word <i>pirchah</i> (flowers thereof) is well known.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Hence there is no reason to explain it.</i> If God had not shown Moses the menorah in a prophetic vision, then no wise craftsman would have had the ability to make the menorah described in Scripture.
SO HE MADE. This refers to Moses. The meaning of <i>made</i> is, made by command.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Moses commanded a craftsman to make the menorah.</i> The same applies to <i>And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold</i> (Ex. 25:31).
The section dealing with the Levites follows the one dealing with the lighting of the menorah to teach us that Aaron shall occupy himself with the kindling of the lamps.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">By himself, as stated in verse 2.</i> However, the Levites shall assist him in the other services and shall stand before him to do all that he commands.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 19.</i>

Verse 5



Verse 6

Verse 7

THE WATER OF PURIFICATION. <i>Chattat</i> (purification)<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>chattat</i> usually means sin. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> here is similar to the word <i>techatteni</i> (purify me) (Ps. 51:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> Or it is possible that the <i>me chattat</i> (the water of purification) was similar to a sin offering (<i>korban chattat</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, <i>me chattat</i> (the water of purification) means sin water, water which serves as a sin offering. In other words, the water atones for sin.</i>
SPRINKLE…UPON THEM. Rabbi Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Moses ibn Gikatilla, an 11th-century Spanish philologist and Bible commentator.</i> says that the first root letter of <i>hazzeh</i> (sprinkle) is a <i>nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the root of <i>hazzeh</i> is <i>nun, zayin, heh</i>.</i> Compare, <i>hakkeh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>hakkeh</i> (and of <i>takkeh</i>) is <i>nun, kof, heh</i>. Thus <i>hazzeh</i> is like <i>hakkeh</i>. They are both in the <i>hifil</i> and they both come from a root that opens with a <i>nun</i>.</i> <i>takkeh</i> (thou shalt surely smite) (Deut. 13:16). Rabbi Moses is correct.
AND LET THEM CAUSE A RAZOR TO PASS OVER ALL THEIR FLESH. Its meaning is, and they have already caused a razor to pass over their flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-he’eviru</i> (and let them cause to pass) is a pluperfect. I.E. comments thus because the shaving of the body preceded the sprinkling.</i> The sages said<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Nazir</i> 40-41.</i> even the beard,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 14:9.</i> but not the corner of the beard.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 21:5.</i>
AND LET THEM WASH THEIR CLOTHES. And after this<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">After they wash their clothes.</i> they will be cleansed, being purified by the waters of purification.
[AND CLEANSE THEMSELVES.] The word <i>ve-hitteharu</i> (and cleanse themselves) is a <i>hitpa’el</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it does not have a <i>tav</i> in it.</i> The <i>tav</i> of the <i>hitpa’el</i> is swallowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">By the <i>tet</i>.</i> Compare, <i>ha-mitkaddeshim ve-ha-mittaharim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mittaharim</i> is in the <i>hitpa’el</i> and does not have a <i>tav</i> in it, for its <i>tav</i> is swallowed by its <i>tet</i>.</i> (They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves) (Is. 66:17).

Verse 8

A YOUNG BULLOCK. The term <i>ben bakar</i> indicates a young bullock.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew literally reads, a bull (<i>par</i>) <i>ben bakar</i> (the son of cattle). I.E. points out that this should be interpreted as a bull, a young bovine.</i>
FINE FLOUR. Three-tenth parts (of an <i>efah</i>) as is the law.
SHALT THOU TAKE. By issuing a command, for the Levites shall take.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse opens by saying, <i>Then let them</i> (the Levites) <i>take a young bullock</i>. Thus it is the Levites who do the taking.</i> The meaning of <i>Then let them take</i> (ve-lakechu) is, then let them give.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>shalt thou take</i> means shalt thou offer.</i> Compare, <i>ve-yikechu li terumah</i> (that they take for Me an offering).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, that they give (<i>ve-yikechu</i>) to Me an offering. We thus see that the Hebrew word <i>yikkach</i> (to take) sometimes has the meaning of to give.</i> On the other hand, the meaning of <i>Then let them take</i> might be that they shall take with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, <i>ve-lakechu</i> (then let them take) has its usual meaning.</i> Compare, <i>they shall take</i> (ve-yikechu) <i>to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses</i> (Ex. 12:3).

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

BEFORE THE LORD. Its meaning is, when you present the Levites before the tent, the Levites shall lay their hands upon the head of each one of the bullocks.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>al rosh ha-parim</i> (upon the heads of the bullocks). This literally reads, upon the head of the bullocks. I.E. interprets this to mean upon the head of each one of the bullocks.</i> There are many similar instances in Scripture.

Verse 12

AND OFFER THOU. Offer by command, for Aaron was the celebrant. Scripture’s statement that the sin offering and also the burnt offering were to make atonement for the Levites is true proof of the aforementioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">That Aaron was the celebrant, for Aaron was the one making atonement offerings (v. 21).</i> Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>and Aaron made an atonement for them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The Levites.</i> (v. 21).

Verse 13

[AND THOU SHALT SET THE LEVITES BEFORE AARON.] After Aaron shall make atonement for the Levites, you shall set them up before Aaron, and Aaron shall offer them for a wave offering.
AND OFFER THEM FOR A WAVE-OFFERING. Via your command. Compare, <i>And offer thou</i> (v. 12).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. The <i>Mikra’ot Gedolot</i> reads, and whatsoever there may be to do with them (Num. 4:26). However, this appears to be an error. See Filwarg.</i>

Verse 14

AND THE LEVITES SHALL BE MINE. This is a great status.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the Levites were elevated to a great status.</i>

Verse 15

AND AFTER THAT SHALL THE LEVITES GO IN. After you purify them.
AND OFFER THEM. Via your command.

Verse 16

FOR THEY ARE WHOLLY GIVEN UNTO ME. They, and their children, are given unto Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>ki netunim, netunim li</i> (for they are wholly given unto Me).

Verse 17

ON THE DAY THAT I SMOTE.

Verse 18

[AND I HAVE TAKEN THE LEVITES.] Scripture has already stated, <i>have I taken them unto Me</i> (v. 16). This is the style of Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">To repeat itself after digressing.</i> <i>And I have taken the Levites</i> is connected to the verse which follows.

Verse 19

AND TO MAKE ATONEMENT. To be an atonement for the souls of the children of Israel, as I have already explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 32:29.</i>

Verse 20

THUS DID MOSES AND AARON. Moses by command, Aaron by waving them, and Israel by the laying of their hands on them.

Verse 21

[AND THE LEVITES PURIFIED THEMSELVES.] Scripture tells us that they also performed [purification rituals].
AND AARON MADE ATONEMENT FOR THEM. And Aaron had already made atonement for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Before Aaron offered them as a sacred gift before the Lord. Thus <i>va-yekhapper</i> is a pluperfect that means had made atonement.</i> Others say that the Levites first purified themselves and afterwards laid their hands on the bullocks.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">After which Aaron offered them for a wave offering and made atonement for them (Krinsky).</i> This interpretation is not far off the mark.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For it is based on a literal interpretation of <i>va-yekhapper</i> (and made atonement).</i> If this is so, then the meaning of <i>And thou shalt set the Levites</i> (v. 13) is: and you have already set the Levites<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The atonement ritual was the final act in the cleansing ritual of the Levites.</i> at the beginning.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">That is, before Aaron made atoonement fot them.

Verse 22

SO DID THEY UNTO THEM. So did the sons of Aaron always unto the children of the Levites.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the commandments in our chapter regarding the Levites (verses 6-14). This apparently applies to future generations as well.</i>

Verse 23



Verse 24

THIS IS THAT WHICH PERTAINETH UNTO THE LEVITES. Its meaning is, this is the set time of service which pertains to the Levites.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>zot</i> (this is) is short for <i>zot ha-kitzvah</i> (the set time of service).</i> The verse reading <i>from thirty years and upward</i> (Num. 4:23)<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 4:23 gives as the age of <i>all that enter…to do service in the tent of meeting</i>.</i> does not contradict our verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Hullin</i> 24a, they begin their studies at the age of 25 and their service at the age of 30.

We do not have to search for the meaning of this phrase, for our sages have already transmitted to us the meaning of <i>afar off</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Mishnah, <i>Pes</i>. 9:2, <i>afar off</i> means outside of the threshold of the temple courtyard. For other opinions see <i>Pes</i>. 9:2.</i>
OF YOU. This refers to being unclean by reason of a dead body.
OR OF YOUR GENERATIONS. This refers to both a person who is unclean by reason of a dead body and to one in a journey far off.

Verse 12



Verse 13

AND IS NOT ON A JOURNEY. <i>U-ve-derekh</i> (and on a journey) is to be rendered, or is on a journey.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>vav</i> of <i>u-ve-derekh</i> is to be rendered “or,” not “and.” I.E. comments thus because he believes that the law of being far off did not apply in the wilderness (I.E. on verse 10). Hence he reads our verse as follows: But the man that is unclean in the wilderness, and is on a journey in future generations. So Filwarg. For additional interpretations see Krinsky and Avi Ezri.</i> <i>U-makkeh aviv ve-immo</i> (and he that smiteth his father, or his mother)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and he that smiteth his father and his mother.</i> (Ex. 21:15) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In that its meaning is, and he that smiteth his father, or his mother.</i>
SHALL BEAR HIS SIN. He alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Not his descendants.</i>

Verse 14

AND IF A STRANGER SHALL SOJOURN AMONG YOU. He too shall observe the second Passover<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If unclean or far off.</i> in accordance with the ordinance. Others say that the reference is to the first Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Passover observed in Nisan.</i>

Verse 15

AND ON THE DAY THAT THE TABERNACLE WAS REARED UP. Scripture begins to count the journeys of Israel. It was thus compelled to make mention of the cloud that rested on the tabernacle, for when it camped they camped and when it journeyed<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. Our texts read, <i>when they journeyed, they journeyed</i>.</i> they journeyed.
EVEN THE TENT OF THE TESTIMONY. <i>Le-ohel</i> (even the tent) is to be rendered, on the tent.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>lamed</i> usually has the meaning of to. Hence I.E.’s comment. I.E. renders our verse, the cloud covered the tabernacle, on the tent of the testimony.</i> There are many such instances in Scripture.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

AT THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED. Its meaning is clear, for God caused the cloud to rest and God caused it to journey.

Verse 19

AND WHEN THE CLOUD TARRIED. The meaning of <i>u- ve-ha’arikh</i> (and when it tarried) is to be rendered, and if it tarried.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Nahmanides interprets similarly.</i> Scripture first speaks in general terms.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That Israel travelled and camped in the wilderness.</i> It then goes on to say that sometimes the Israelites would journey for a few days or encamp according to the commandment of the Lord.

Verse 20



Verse 21

OR IF IT CONTINUED BY DAY AND BY NIGHT. They thus occasionally journeyed at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This means that <i>yomam va-laylah</i> (by day and by night) is to be rendered, by day <i>or</i> by night. Our verse reads as follows: or if it (the cloud) continued by day or by night, when the cloud was taken up they journeyed. In other words, sometimes the cloud stayed over the tabernacle during the day and was taken up at the beginning of the night. Thus Israel at times took up their journey at night.</i> Others say that <i>yomam va-laylah</i> (by day and by night) is to be interpreted literally.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>vav</i> of <i>yomam va-laylah</i> is to be translated literally. Thus <i>yomam va-laylah</i> means by day <i>and</i> by night. Therefore what the verse is telling us is that the cloud continued on the tabernacle a day and a night and was taken up in the morning, and then Israel journeyed. The verse thus teaches that Israel journeyed in the morning, not at night.</i> This interpretation appears correct to me. The term <i>yomayim</i> (two days) (v. 22)<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. See also Filwarg. The printed texts have <i>yomam</i>.</i> is proof that this interpretation is correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>yomayim</i> follows <i>yomam va-laylah</i>. <i>Yomayim</i> refers to two days and two nights. Hence <i>yomam va-laylah</i> must refer to a day and a night.</i>

Verse 22

OR A YEAR. The word <i>yomam</i> means a full year.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 25:29.</i>

Verse 23

AT THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD THEY ENCAMPED. This is stated at the end of the chapter to indicate that this was the procedure as long as Israel lived in the wilderness.

Chapter 10



Verse 1



Verse 2

MAKE THEE TWO TRUMPETS OF SILVER. <i>Chatzotzerot</i> (trumpets) is a noun. In its verbal form, one of the <i>tzadis</i> is not pronounced even though it is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>machtzerim</i> (did blow) in I Chron. 15:24. <i>Machtzerim</i> is spelled with two <i>tzadis</i>. However, only one of them is pronounced.</i>
FOR THE CALLING. <i>Le-mikra</i> (for the calling) is an infinitive. The same applies to <i>u-le-massa</i> (and for causing to set forward). On the other hand, they might be nouns. In this case, the word <i>le-mikra</i> (for the calling) means at the time of calling, and <i>le-massa</i> (and for causing to set forward), at the time of journeying.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the last clause of our verse reads, and they shall be unto thee (for use) at the time of the calling of the congregation and at the time when the camps set forward.</i> The first interpretation appears correct to me.

Verse 3

AND WHEN THEY SHALL BLOW WITH THEM. And when the trumpeters shall blow with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The subject of “and when they shall blow” is not in the text.

If a <i>tru’ah</i> (an alarm)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to tradition a <i>tru’ah</i> is a wavering sound.</i> sounds, then the standard of Judah shall journey, even though the cloud is upon the tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And thus could not as yet lead Israel, for the tabernacle was dismantled after the tribe of Judah started their journey. See verse 17. I.E. points this out because, according to Num. 14:14, Israel was led by a cloud. See next note.</i> In the opinion of many, another cloud<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Aside from the one that rested on the tabernacle.</i> journeyed before the Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For Num. 14:14 clearly states, <i>And Thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud</i>.</i>

Verse 5

THE CAMPS THAT LIE ON THE EAST SIDE SHALL TAKE THEIR JOURNEY. For they consisted of three camps.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the standard of Judah (Num. 2:3). Now the standard of Judah (and so every other standard) consisted of three camps. Hence Scripture refers to the standard of Judah by the term “camps.”</i>

Verse 6

AN ALARM THE SECOND TIME. So that the standard of Reuben will take up its journey. They did not blow the trumpets again,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">After the tribe of Reuben journeyed.</i> for the family of Kohath and with them the <i>kohanim</i> who blew the trumpets journeyed before the standard of Ephraim.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohanim</i> journeyed between the standard of Reuben and the standard of Ephraim. Thus when it came time for Ephraim to journey, the <i>kohanim</i> had already journeyed and were not in a position to sound the trumpets.</i>
THEY SHALL BLOW AN ALARM FOR THEIR JOURNEYS. The <i>kohanim</i> shall blow an alarm for their journeys, for they journeyed after the standard of Reuben.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hence after the standard of Reuben journeyed, the trumpets were no longer sounded.</i>

Verse 7



Verse 8

Verse 9

AND YE SHALL BE REMEMBERED. For you have done what God the glorious commanded you do. The alarm (<i>tru’ah</i>) also serves as a reminder to the people to cry out to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">An additional reason for sounding the <i>tru’ah</i>.</i>

Verse 28

THUS WERE THE JOURNEYINGS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Its meaning is, thus did they journey all the days that they were in the wilderness.

Verse 29

[29. AND MOSES SAID UNTO HOBAB, THE SON OF REUEL.] We find Scripture telling us that Zipporah was the daughter of Reuel, for it is written, <i>and he</i> [Reuel] <i>gave Moses Zipporah his daughter</i> (Ex. 2:21). Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>to water their father’s flock</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Reuel’s daughters, that is, Zipporah and her sisters.</i> (Ex. 2:16), <i>and to Reuel their</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Zipporah and her sisters.</i> <i>father</i> (Ex. 2:18). Now Hobab was the son of Reuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated in our verse.</i> Thus Hobab<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The son of Reuel.</i> was the brother of Zipporah.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The daughter of Reuel.</i> According to a rational analysis of Scripture, Hobab is to be identified with Jethro, because the Torah states, <i>as thou</i> [Hobab] <i>knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness</i> (v. 31) and it states with regard to Jethro when he came to the wilderness, <i>into the wilderness where he was encamped</i> (Ex. 18:5). Should one disagree<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">With the identification of Hobab with Jethro.</i> and argue that Scripture refers to Jethro as <i>choten mosheh</i> (Moses’ father-in-law) (Ex. 18:1), then one can respond that it is the way of Scripture to refer to the father and the brother of a young woman by the term <i>choten</i> (father-in-law).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Thus according to I.E. the word <i>choten</i> means a father or brother-in-law.</i> <i>Unto Hobab, the son of Reuel…choten mosheh</i> (Moses’ father-in-law)<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse.</i> is proof of the aforementioned. For it has already been made clear to you that Hobab was the brother of Zipporah, and Scripture calls him <i>choten mosheh</i> (Moses’ father-in-law). Should one argue that <i>choten mosheh</i> (Moses’ father-in-law) is not connected to Hobab but to Reuel, then the response is, Scripture explicitly states <i>Hobab choten mosheh</i> (the father-in-law of Moses) (Jud. 4:11). Many say that Hobab and Jethro are one and the same. They maintain that Jethro/Hobab was the father of Zipporah and that Reuel was the grandfather of Zipporah. They argue that Scripture says, <i>to Reuel their father</i> (Ex. 2:18)<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The father of Zipporah and her sister.</i> in the same manner that Jacob said, <i>O God of my father Abraham</i> (Gen. 32:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac, not Abraham, was Jacob’s father. Thus father is used for grandfather. Similarly, in Ex. 2:18 father refers to grandfather.</i> Scripture similarly refers to Zipporah as Reuel’s daughter in the same manner that it refers to Belshazzar as Nebuchadnezzar’s son,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Dan. 5:2; 18:22.</i> when in fact he was Nebuchadnezzar’s grandson. Our sages say that Jethro had seven names.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta,Va-yishma Yitro</i> 1.</i> There are seventy faces to the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">A quote from <i>Otiyyot de-Rabbi Akiva</i>, a late aggadic Midrash on the alphabet composed sometime between 700-900 C.E. Some manuscripts read, there are seven faces to the Torah. According to the rabbis, Jethro, Hobab, and Reuel are one and the same person (see Rashi on Ex. 18:1 where he quotes all seven names). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 30

TO MINE OWN LAND, AND TO MY KINDRED.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads <i>moladti</i>.

Verse 31

LEAVE US NOT, I PRAY THEE. The word <i>na</i> (I pray thee) means now. The same applies to the word <i>na</i> in all of Scripture. The opposite is the case in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">In Arabic the word for now is <i>an</i> or <i>malan</i>. See I.E. on Gen. 12:11 (Vol. 1, p. 154).</i>
FORASMUCH AS THOU KNOWEST. <i>Ki al ken</i> (forasmuch) here means the same as <i>ki al ken</i> in <i>forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son</i> (Gen. 38:26). Since (<i>ki al ken</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the meaning of <i>ki al ken</i> is since.</i> you know the place where we encamped, come with us.
AND THOU SHALT BE TO US INSTEAD OF EYES. You will show us the way.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eyes</i> is a metaphor for a guide (Weiser).</i> Many say that <i>ve-hayita</i> (and thou shalt be) is to be taken as a perfect<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it is technically an imperfect.</i> and alludes to the advice which Jethro gave Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the appointment of judges, see Ex. 18:21-23.</i> He showed Moses what Moses did not know. They say this is what eyes refers to. 
The meaning of <i>And he said: Leave us not, I pray thee</i> is, and he had already said to him [leave us not I pray thee]<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, what is reported in verse 31 took place before what is reported in verse 30.</i> but it was to no avail.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of our verse.</i>

Verse 32



Verse 33

[33. AND THEY SET FORWARD FROM THE MOUNT OF THE LORD THREE DAYS’ JOURNEY.] In my opinion the first journey was unlike the rest of the journeys. The verse which states, <i>and the Kohathites…set forward</i> (v. 21) after the two standards journeyed refers to all the other journeys except this one, for<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">During the first journey.</i> the ark journeyed before the camp of the Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">And in all of the other journeys, it journeyed amidst the camp of the Israelites. See Num. 2:17.</i> However, this was the case for only three days. This is the meaning of <i>three days</i> (v. 33). Similarly, <i>And they went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham</i> (Num. 33:8) does not mean that they traveled a three days journey in one day.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">It means they traveled for three days.</i> Others say<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">That the meaning of our verse is.</i> that they traveled a three-day journey in one day.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rashi.</i> Others say that they traveled a journey of three days corresponding to the journeys when they left Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">When Israel crossed the Sea of Reeds, they journeyed for three days (Ex. 15:22). They similarly journeyed for three days when they left the wilderness of Sinai.</i> and the ark was a three-day distance from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This is how others interpret, <i>And the ark of the covenant…went before them three days’ journey to seek out a resting-place for them</i>.</i> This is the meaning of <i>and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</i> (v. 12).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation Paran is three days’ journey from Sinai. The ark traveled three days’ distance from Israel and rested in the wilderness of Paran. When the ark rested, Israel began its journey.</i> They explain that <i>And they took their first journey</i> (v. 13), means that they journeyed by the command of Moses, for the cloud traveled immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">With the ark. In other words, the cloud which led Israel was with the ark, not with the camp of Israel.</i> However, this is not so, for Moses did not distance himself from the ark, as proved by <i>And it came to pass, when the ark set forward</i> (v. 35) <i>And when it rested</i> (v. 36). What I said above appears correct to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">That the first journey was different from all other journeys (Weiser). Or, that the ark did not travel a three days’ journey from the camp but that it journeyed in front of the camp (Krinsky).</i> <i>Paran</i>, in <i>and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</i> (v. 12), is a general name for Taberah,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 11:3.</i> which is the same as Kibroth-hattaavah (v. 34), Hazeroth (Num. 33:17), Rithmah (Num. 33:18), and many other journeys.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, is the name of the district where Israel encamped in the wilderness.</i> The fact that Scripture does not mention the wilderness of Paran in the Torah portion <i>Elleh Mase</i> (these are the stages)<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Which lists the journeys of the children of Israel. See Num. 33:1-49.</i> is proof of this. I will explain this later.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of verse 12. See I.E. on Num. 12:16.</i>
The meaning of <i>according to the commandment of the Lord</i> (v. 13) is, when the trumpets sounded the alarm.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">For Moses and the cloud were traveling before the camp.</i>

Verse 36

AND WHEN IT RESTED. When the ark rested. <i>U-venucho</i> (when it rested) is spelled with a <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than a <i>vav</i>.

RETURN, O LORD.

It is possible that ten thousand is called a <i>revavah</i> because it is a great number. The word <i>revavah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">In its plural form <i>revevot</i>.</i> is therefore connected to the word <i>alfe</i> (thousands).<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Thus I.E. renders our clause, Give rest, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel (<i>revevot alfe yisra’el</i>).</i> Moses prayed that God would grant rest and quiet to all of Israel, though they be many.

Verse 2

Verse 4

AND THE MIXED MULTITUDE. Who were gathered unto the children of Israel but were not of Israelite stock. The <i>asafsuf</i> (the mixed multitude) refers to the <i>erev rav</i> (the mixed multitude).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in Ex. 12:38.</i> The word is constructed by doubling two root letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Its two final root letters, <i>samekh, feh</i>.</i> Compare, <i>secharchar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>samekh, chet, resh</i>, doubling the <i>chet</i> and <i>resh</i>.</i> (fluttereth) (Ps. 38:11) and <i>chamarmaru</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>chet, mem, resh</i>, doubling the <i>mem</i> and <i>resh</i>.</i> (burn) (Lam. 1:20).

With them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>va-yashuvu va-yivku gam bene yisra’el</i> (and the children of Israel also wept on their part). I.E. interprets <i>va-yashuvu va- yivku</i> as referring to the mixed multitude. He reads our verse as follows: And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a-lusting, and after lusting turned and wept, also the children of Israel with them. I.E.’s point is that the mixed multitude caused Israel to weep and ask for meat (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 5

THE FISH. The word <i>dagah</i> (fish) is a general term.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For all the different species of fish.</i>
FOR NOUGHT. Cheaply, as if we got it for nothing.
THE CUCUMBERS. An <i>alef</i> has been substituted for a <i>heh</i> in the word <i>kishu’im</i> (cucumbers), for <i>kishu’im</i> is related to the word <i>mikshah</i> (cucumber) (Is. 1:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mikshah</i> is spelled with a <i>heh</i>.</i> Compare, <i>telu’im</i> (suspense) in <i>And My people are in suspense about returning to Me</i> (Hos. 11:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Telu’im</i> is spelled with an <i>alef</i>. However, it comes from the root <i>tav, lamed, heh</i>, and should read <i>teluyim</i>. Thus here too an <i>alef</i> has been substituted for a <i>heh</i>.</i> There are many such instances.
MELONS. We can ascertain the meaning of <i>avatichim</i> (melons) from Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Arabic word for melon is <i>batikha</i>.</i> It has no cognate in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, no neighbor in Scripture.</i>
AND THE LEEKS. The word <i>chatzir</i> (leeks) refers to vegetables,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>yerakot</i> (literally, greens).</i> which are the grass of the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chatzir</i> means grass. However, people do not eat grass. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Compare, <i>Who maketh the mountains to spring with grass</i> (chatzir) (Ps. 147:8). <i>Chatzir</i> is thus an all-inclusive noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to all types of greens.</i> However, the Aramaic translation<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos.</i> says that it refers to a specific kind.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>chatzir</i> by the term <i>kerate</i> (leeks).</i> It too is correct.

Verse 6

BUT NOW OUR SOUL IS DRIED AWAY. The reference is to the lusting soul, which is implanted in the liver.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>The Secret of the Torah</i>, page 96. According to I.E. there are three souls in the body, <i>neshamah, ru’ach</i>, and <i>nefesh</i>. The <i>neshamah</i> (rational soul) is manifested in the brain; the <i>ru’ach</i> (spirit) is located in the heart; and the <i>nefesh</i> (the lusting soul), the part of the psyche that desires food and sex, is in the liver.</i>
THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL. We lack everything.
TO LOOK TO. For the manna came down from heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">We watch the manna come down from the heavens (Weiser).</i>

Verse 7

NOW THE MANNA. Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse.</i> describes the stupidity of those who lusted, for the manna was like coriander seed, which is easy to pick, and it was easy to see, for it was white. Furthermore, they could eat it as it was. They could also grind it in mills and make cakes out of it. They could also beat it in mortars and cook it in pots. It had an especially good taste, for it tasted like [food] with the finest oil. Additionally, it came down after the dew had washed the place [upon which it fell]. It thus descended upon a clean place.
LIKE CORIANDER SEED. <i>Zera</i> (seed) is in the construct.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> rather than with a <i>segol</i> beneath the <i>zayin</i>.</i> It is like the word <i>neta</i> (plant of)<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Which is vocalized with a <i>sheva</i> rather than with a <i>segol</i> beneath the <i>nun</i>.</i> in <i>the plant of His delight</i> (Is. 5:7).
CORIANDER. Some identify this with <i>kusbarta</i>. Others say that it refers to mustard. They connect <i>gad</i> (coriander) with the word <i>gidin</i> (sinews).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Something hard (bitter) to the taste, i.e., mustard seed. See I.E.’s short commentary on Ex. 16:31.</i> However, I do not know its meaning.

Verse 8

THE PEOPLE WENT ABOUT. The word <i>shatu</i> (went about) is related to the word <i>shut</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>shin, vav, tet</i>.</i> (going to and fro) in <i>From going to and fro</i> (mi-shut) <i>in the earth</i> (Job 1:7). This shows that the individual pieces of manna did not fall in one place<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, together. It did not fall in one large pile but evenly over some distance.</i> but were spread and scattered.
IN MILLS. Operated by hand. The word <i>rechayim</i> (mills) does not come in the singular,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>rechayim</i> is in the plural. However, it also refers to the singular, that is, to a mill as in our verse, for <i>rechayim</i> (mills) is parallel to <i>medochah</i> (mortar), which is singular.</i> for a mill consists of two parts.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">An upper and a lower stone.</i>
IN MORTARS. A vessel made out of wood or stone. It is called a <i>medocha</i> (mortars)<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a mortar. See previous note.</i> because they pound in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>medocha</i> comes from the root <i>dalet, caf, heh</i>, which means to crush.</i> It was also possible to make cakes from what they pounded.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to cooking it. Scripture reads, <i>and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it</i>. I.E. notes that this should be interpreted, and seethed it in pots, <i>or</i> made cakes of it.</i>
AND MADE CAKES. Compare, <i>and make cakes</i> (Gen. 18:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the word make can mean bake.</i>
A CAKE. Some say that the <i>lamed</i> of <i>leshad</i> (cake) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The basic word is <i>shad</i> (breast). According to this interpretation, <i>leshad ha-shamen</i> means breast of the oil. See <i>Sifre</i> on Num. 11:8. “Just as the suckling imbibes, so to speak, every possible flavor with the mother-milk, so the Israelites found all flavors in the manna” (translated by Rosenbaum &amp; Silbermann, Num. p. 54). So too Rashi, “Our Rabbis explained it as meaning breasts.”</i> It is similar to the <i>lamed</i> of <i>shalanan</i> (at ease)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The basic word being <i>sha’anan</i>.</i> in <i>at ease and quiet</i> (Job 21:23). The word <i>ha-shamen</i> (with oil) should have been ultimately accented<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">However, <i>ha-shamen</i> is ultimately accented. When the word <i>shemen</i> or <i>shamen</i> is a noun, it is penultimately accented; when an adjective, it is ultimately accented.</i> because<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation.</i> the word <i>shamen</i> (oil) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Describing <i>leshad</i>.</i> However, I believe that the <i>lamed</i> of <i>leshad</i> is a root letter. The word <i>leshad</i> is similar to the word <i>leshadi</i> (my sap) in <i>My sap was turned</i> (Ps. 32:4). <i>My</i> (leshadi) <i>sap</i> stands in contrast to <i>the droughts</i> (charvone) in <i>the droughts of summer</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.)<i>. Leshad</i> refers to the finest part of the oil that floats on top of all oil. In this case, the word <i>ha-shamen</i> is penultimately vocalized in accordance with the meaning of the word.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For the word is a noun.</i>

Verse 9



Verse 10

WEEPING, FAMILY BY FAMILY. The families gathered together to cry, as they do when they mourn for the dead.
EVERY MAN AT THE DOOR OF HIS TENT. In public.
AND MOSES WAS DISPLEASED. The word <i>ra</i> (displeased) is a perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">And also a present form.

Verse 12

HAVE I CONCEIVED. Am I their mother?
HAVE I BROUGHT THEM FORTH. Or am I their father? <i>Yelidtihu</i> (brought them forth) is like the word <i>yalad</i> (begot) in <i>and Shelah begot Eber</i> (Gen. 10:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders our clause: Did I beget them?</i>
CARRY THEM. Until they come to the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads, <i>sa’eh…al ha-adamah</i>. This literally means, carry them…upon the land.

Verse 13

WHENCE.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>me-ayin</i>.</i> When the word <i>ayin</i> has a <i>mem</i> prefixed to it,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">As in our verse.</i> it means from which place.

Verse 14

BECAUSE IT IS TOO HEAVY FOR ME. The word <i>kaved</i> (heavy) is a verb in the perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">And also a present.

Verse 27

AND THERE RAN A YOUNG MAN. The word <i>na’ar</i> (young man) has the definite article prefixed to it because it refers to the young man<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not identify the young man.</i> who, aside from Joshua, was known to serve Moses. For Joshua’s service was not the usual service rendered by young men.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua served Moses in more dignified tasks.</i>

Verse 28

FROM HIS YOUTH UP. Some say that the meaning of <i>mi-bechurav</i> (from his youth up) is, from his youth. It means that he did not speak as an elder speaks.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">He spoke as a youth speaks.</i> Others connect <i>mi-bechurav</i> (from his youth up) to <i>mesharet mosheh</i> (the minister of Moses);<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">They read our text as follows: <i>mesharet mosheh mi-bechurav</i>, meaning the minister of Moses from his (Joshua’s) youth on.</i> this means the one who served Moses from the time of his youth.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">So Onkelos and Rashbam.</i> However, this is incorrect, for this event occurred in the second year.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Following the Exodus. However, Scripture nowhere tells us that Joshua served Moses before this date.</i> In my opinion, the word <i>mi-bechurav</i> means from the chosen. It means that he was one of those chosen to serve Moses, for there were others with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. our clause should be interpreted: And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen, answered and said.</i> Note that the word <i>bachur</i> (youth, or chosen) sometimes changes in the plural and sometimes does not.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">In the plural the word is at times vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> (Ps. 78:31) and at other times with a <i>sheva</i> as in our verse (<i>bechurav</i>, rather than <i>bachurav</i>).</i> The same applies to the word <i>saris</i> (officer).<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">The plural of <i>saris</i> is both <i>sarisim</i> (Esth. 2:21) and <i>serisim</i> (Gen. 40:7).</i> It is also possible that they belong to two different paradigms.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bachurav</i> comes from the singular <i>bachur</i> (vocalized <i>pattach, shurik</i>), <i>bechurav</i> from the singular <i>bachur</i> (vocalized <i>kamatz, shurik</i>).

However, in the latter case the <i>pattach</i> is maintained in the plural form.</i>
SHUT THEM IN. The <i>lamed</i> of <i>kela’em</i> (shut them in) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a <i>kamatz</i>.

Verse 29

[ART THOU JEALOUS.] The <i>heh</i> of <i>ha-mekanne</i> (art thou jealous) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>.

Verse 30

AND MOSES WITHDREW. Moses accompanied the elders in order to honor them.

Verse 31

AND THERE WENT FORTH A WIND. On the second day.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 18.</i>
AND BROUGHT ACROSS. The word <i>va-gaz</i> (brought across) means cut. It is similar to the word <i>gazi</i> (cut) in <i>Cut off thy hair</i> (Jer. 7:29). The word <i>gez</i> (cutting) in <i>and the first of the cutting of thy sheep</i> (Deut. 18:4)<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> is related to it.
Scripture reads, <i>and cut</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. our verse reads, and cut quails from the sea. Hence his comments.</i> because the quail on the shore of the sea<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>from the sea</i>.</i> were as numerous as the [grains of] sand. Thus God cut off some of the quail from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">God cut off a portion of the quail that were at the seashore and sent them to the camp of the Israelites.</i> <i>Va-yagaz</i> comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>gimel, zayin, zayin</i>.</i> It is like the word <i>va-yacham</i><sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>chet, mem, mem</i>.</i> (waxed warm) in <i>and the flesh of the child waxed warm</i> (II Kings 4:34).
AND LET THEM FALL. The meaning of <i>va-yittosh</i> (and let them fall) is, <i>and they spread</i>. The quail were spread [all around the camp] and did not have the strength to fly away.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they were easy to catch.</i> Compare, <i>they were spread</i> (netushim) <i>abroad all over the ground</i> (I Sam. 30:16).
ROUND ABOUT THE CAMP. Only.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Only round about the camp. Birds fly from place to place.

Verse 32

AND THEY SPREAD. <i>Va-yishtechu</i> means, and they spread. <i>Shittachti</i> (I have spread) in <i>I have spread forth my hands unto Thee</i> (Ps. 88:10) is similar even though they belong to two different forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yishtechu</i> is a <i>kal</i> and <i>shittachti</i> (I have spread) is a <i>pi’el</i>.</i>

Verse 35

THE PEOPLE JOURNEYED UNTO HAZEROTH. <i>Chatzerot</i> (Hazeroth) is to be interpreted as unto Chatzerot. Scripture is being brief.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Our text literally reads, and journeyed Hazeroth. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
<i>And they abode at Hazeroth</i> is connected to <i>And…Miriam spoke</i> (12:1), for they abode there on her account.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

AND MIRIAM…SPOKE. Miriam spoke. Aaron agreed or was silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</i> is to be interpreted: And Miriam spoke against Moses, and Aaron remained silent (or agreed). I.E. interprets thus because our verse reads, <i>va-tedabber miriam ve-aharon</i>.
Now <i>va-tedabber</i> is in the feminine. Thus our verse is to be rendered, And Miriam spoke, and Aaron. If both spoke, then our text should have read, <i>va-yedabberu miriam ve-aharon</i>.</i> Hence he was also punished.<i>Va-tedabber</i> (spoke) is followed by a <i>bet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As it is in our verse, which reads, <i>va-tedabber miriam ve-aharon be-mosheh</i> (And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses).</i> and has a negative connotation. It is similar to <i>va-yedabber ha-am be-Elohim</i> (And the people spoke against God) (Num. 21:5). The verb <i>dabber</i> (spoke) followed by a <i>bet</i> is also found with a positive connotation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, <i>I will now say</i> (adabberah): <i>Peace be within thee</i> (bakh) (Ps. 122:8).</i> It also appears in prophetic statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, <i>The spirit of the Lord spoke by me</i> (II Sam. 23:2).</i> Some say that Moses was king of Cush<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ethiopia.</i> and took a Cushite woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> on <i>Shemot</i> 168; 247.</i> Onkelos renders Cushite, beautiful.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>ha-ishah ha-cushit</i> (the Cushite woman) as the beautiful women (<i>ittetah shappirtah</i>).</i> According to Onkelos, Cushite is an honorific term. The Arabs similarly call pitch white. We too refer to a blind person by the term <i>sege nahor</i> (rich of light).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Berachot</i> 58a.</i> But it is illogical<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">However, see Rashi, who explains Zipporah “was called a Cushite because of her beauty. This is similar to the case of a man who calls his beautiful son Cushi so that the evil eye will not harm him.” I.E. apparently did not believe in the evil eye. Hence he did not accept Rashi’s interpretation.</i> to turn a positive name into a negative one.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When something has a negative connotation we employ a euphemism. However, we do not refer to something positive by a negative term. Hence there is no reason to refer to a beautiful woman as a Cushite.</i> Some say that <i>Cush the Benjaminite</i> (Ps. 7:1) refers to Saul.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">They believe that Saul was very handsome and hence was called <i>cush</i>. See Rashi and I.E. on Ps. 7:1.</i> They say the same with regard to <i>Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians</i> (Khushiyyim) <i>unto Me</i> (Amos 9:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">They say that its meaning is: Are ye not as beautiful children unto me.</i> I have already explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Amos 9:7, where he explains this verse to mean: You are acting like Cushites in that you do not serve me.</i>I believe that the Cushite woman is to be identified with Zipporah, for Zipporah was a Midianite.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 2:15-21.</i> The Midianites are Ishmaelites<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Jud. 8:24.

We thus see that the Midianites live in tents.</i> <i>of the land of Midian do tremble</i> (Hab. 3:7). Because of the sun<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">They are very sunburned. See Cant. 1:5.</i> they do not have any whiteness at all. Zipporah was black and was like a Cushite.
[FOR HE HAD MARRIED A CUSHITE WOMAN.] These are the words that Miriam spoke. How precious are the words of the ancients who said with regard to the elders, “Happy are they, but woe to their wives.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis, Zipporah complained that Moses ceased having sexual relations with her ever since he was chosen to receive Divine revelation. The rabbis say that Miriam spoke on behalf of Zipporah and argued that she too was a prophetess and yet did not abstain from relations with her husband. See <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 17b; <i>Sifre, Devarim</i> 99; and <i>Yalkut Shimoni, Devarim</i> 738.</i> They suspected that Moses refrained from sleeping with Zipporah only because she was not beautiful.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And not because he was a prophet. According to I.E., <i>because of the Cushite woman whom he had married</i> is to be understood as: because he refrained from sleeping with her because she was a Cushite.</i>

Verse 2

AND THEY SAID: HATH THE LORD INDEED SPOKEN ONLY WITH MOSES? Miriam offered proof that Moses did not act in this manner because of the sanctity of God, for they too were prophets and they were not prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse.
ONLY WITH. Scripture reads, <i>ha-rak akh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rak</i> means only; so does <i>akh</i>. Thus our clause, which reads <i>ha-rak akh be-mosheh dibber Adonai</i>, literally reads: Hath the Lord spoken only only with Moses.

Our text should have read, <i>ha-rak be-mosheh</i>, or <i>ha-akh be-mosheh</i>.</i> would have sufficed.

AND THE LORD HEARD IT. Even though they spoke in secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">And did not publicly criticize Moses. Miriam and Aaron spoke only to each other about this. They would not publicly discuss such an intimate matter.</i>

Verse 3

WAS VERY MEEK. The word <i>anav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>ayin, nun, heh</i>.</i> (meek) is similar to the word <i>shalev</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>shin, lamed, heh</i>.</i> (at peace) (Job 16:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Both words come from roots that end in a <i>heh</i>.

Verse 4

SUDDENLY. The <i>mem</i> of <i>pitom</i> (suddenly) is superfluous. It is like the mem of <i>shilshom</i> (three days ago).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mem</i> of which is superfluous.</i> <i>Pitom</i> is related to <i>peti</i> (a thoughtless one) (Prov. 9:4).

COME OUT YE THREE UNTO THE TENT OF MEETING. Each one from his tent. Scripture first speaks generally.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting</i> is a general statement.</i> It then goes into detail, namely, <i>And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud…and called Aaron and Miriam</i> (v. 5), and Moses heard.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">What God told Aaron and Miriam.</i>

Verse 5



Verse 6

HEAR NOW MY WORDS. The word <i>na</i> means now.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 10:31.</i>
A PROPHET AMONG YOU. If there be a prophet of God among you.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>nevi’akhem</i>, which literally means your prophet.

IN A VISION The meaning of <i>im yiheyeh nevi’akhem Adonai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This literally reads, if they will be your prophet Lord.</i> (if there be a prophet among you, I the Lord) is, if there be a prophet, one who is a prophet of God among you.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>nevi’akhem Adonai</i> should be read as if written <i>nevi’akhem nevi Adonai</i>.</i> Compare, <i>ve-hanevu’ah oded ha-navi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. this should be read as if written, <i>ve-ha-nevu’ah nevu’ot oded ha-navi</i> (even the prophecy, prophecy of Oded the prophet), for the word <i>nevu’ah</i> has a definite article prefixed to it and thus cannot be in the construct with <i>oded</i>.

I DO SPEAK WITH HIM IN A DREAM. Scripture repeats itself as is its style in prophecies.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>I do speak with him in a dream</i> repeats <i>I…do make myself known unto him in a vision</i>.</i>

Verse 7

HE IS TRUSTED IN ALL MY HOUSE. It means that Moses is, at it were, a member of My house. He enters without permission. If necessary he states his needs. However, in your case when I make myself known to you in a dream, then you are informed. If not, then you have no permission to ask.

Verse 8

WITH HIM DO I SPEAK MOUTH TO MOUTH. The meaning is, I speak to him without an intermediary.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., God at first spoke to Moses via an angel.

AND…BEHOLD, MIRIAM WAS LEPROUS. <i>Ve-hinneh metzora’at</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Which literally means, and behold, leprous.</i> is to be rendered, and behold, “she” [Miriam] was leprous.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-hinneh metzora’at</i> is to be read as if written, <i>ve-hinneh hi metzora’at</i>.</i> Compare, <i>ka’asher ka’ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Which is to be read as if written, <i>ka’asher hi ka’ah</i>, for <i>ka’asher ka’ah</i> means as spit out.</i> (as it vomited out) (Lev. 18:28).

Verse 12

SHUT UP. As lepers are, so that they do not harm others.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">By their proximity to them.</i>
AND AFTER THAT SHE SHALL BE BROUGHT IN AGAIN. <i>Ve-acher te’asef</i> (and after that she shall be brought in again) means she shall once again be considered as a member of the community. <i>Va-asafto</i> (and you shall bring him in) in <i>and you shall bring him in from his leprosy</i> (II Kings 5:3) is similar. After Miriam returned to the camp, the people journeyed from Hazeroth.

Verse 16

AND PITCHED IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN. Many believe that the cloud was there.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">In Paran.</i> They interpret thus because they found Scripture stating <i>and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</i> (Num. 10:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 10:31.</i> They interpret <i>And when the cloud was removed from over the Tent</i> (v. 10) literally.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">That the cloud left the tent of meeting and took up its journey to Paran.

However, our Torah portion seems to imply that Moses sent spies to Canaan in response to God’s command.</i> God then said, <i>Send thou men</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, what is reported in our verse was in response to Israel’s request reported in Deut. 1:21,22.</i>
The meaning of <i>men</i> is, men known for their might. The same applies to <i>all of them men</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is, all of them were men known for their might.</i> (v. 3) and to <i>be thou</i> [Solomon] <i>strong and show thyself a man</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>and show thyself a man</i> is: and show thyself to be a man of valor.</i> (I Kings 2:2), for he [Solomon] was a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>and show thyself to be man</i> cannot be taken literally.</i>
THAT THEY MAY SPY OUT. The meaning of <i>ve-yaturu</i> (that they may spy out) is that they may search out. Compare, <i>ve-lo taturu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>ve-lo taturu</i> as: and you shall not search out after what your eyes see.</i> (and that ye go not about) (Num. 15:39).
EVERY ONE A PRINCE AMONG THEM. <i>Kol nasi ba-hem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, every prince among them. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> is to be interpreted: each one was a prince among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>kol nasi ba-hem</i> is short for <i>kol ehad hu nasi be-hem</i>.</i> On the other hand, the word <i>ehad</i> mentioned earlier in our verse also applies here.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the word <i>ehad</i> is not missing in our text, and <i>kol echad nasi ba-hem</i> is not short for <i>kol echad hu nasi ba-hem</i>. There doesn’t seem to be much of a difference between the two interpretations offered by I.E. See Filwarg and Krinsky.</i> Compare, <i>And two men, captains of bands, were</i> [captains of] <i>the son of Saul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (II Sam. 4:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is to be interpreted: <i>And two men, captains of</i> (sare) <i>bands, were captains of the son of Saul</i>, for <i>captains of</i> (sare) is to be read as if written twice.</i> There are many such examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Where a word in a verse is to be read as if written twice in a verse.

[THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE MEN.] The reason that Scripture states, <i>these are the names of the men</i>, after earlier stating, <i>And these were their names</i> (v. 4),<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>These are the names of the men</i> after And <i>these were their names</i> appears redundant. Hence I.E. comment.</i> is to teach us that, unlike Hoshea,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Whose name was changed to Joshua (v. 16).</i> their names were never changed.

Verse 17

GET YOU UP HERE INTO THE SOUTH. Get you up this way in the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>alu zeh ba-negev</i> is to be rendered: get you up this way i n the south (of the land of Canaan). The literal meaning of <i>alu zeh ba-negev</i> is: get you up this into the south. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is known that Egypt is south of the land of Israel, as I have explained in the Book of Daniel.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Dan. 11:5.</i> The following is proof of this. Egypt is less than thirty degrees north of the equator.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>rochav</i>, a term referring to the distance of a plane to the equator.</i> Jerusalem is thirty-three degrees north of the equator.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See above.</i> The desert of Paran<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Where Israel was encamped when Moses sent out the spies.</i> is south of the land of Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The text reads, south of the land of Egypt. Paran was the place where Israel was when it sent out the spies. Geographically speaking, Paran is not south of Egypt. It is north of Egypt and lies between Egypt and Canaan. Hence a number of commentaries suggest emending the text to read, the wilderness of Paran is south of the land of Israel, or the wilderness of Paran is north of the land of Egypt. See Filwarg, Weiser, Krinsky, and Meijler.</i> Observe that the meaning of <i>in the South</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ba-negev</i>.</i> is not south of the camp<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For taking a road south of the camp would lead them back into Egypt, as Paran is north of Egypt.</i> but in the south of the land of Canaan. Proof of the aforementioned is that Scripture tells us concerning Hebron, which belonged to the tribe of Judah, <i>Judah shall abide in his border on the south</i> (Josh. 18:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the south (the Negev) is a district in the Land of Israel.</i>

Verse 18

AND SEE THE LAND, WHAT IT IS. And the people, what is it?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the term <i>ma hi</i> (what is it) is carried over from <i>ha-aretz</i> (and the land) to <i>ha-am</i> (the people). Thus our text is to be read as if written, <i>et ha-aretz mah hi vet ha-am ma hu</i> (the land, what it is and the people what is it,) i.e., what is their nature.</i>
WHETHER THEY ARE STRONG. In battle. Scripture then<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 19.</i> goes on to explain, <i>and see the land</i>. It says, <i>and what the land is…whether it is good</i>, that is, whether its air and water are good.

Verse 19

WHETHER IN CAMPS. Like the Kederites,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">An Ishmaelite tribe. See Gen. 25:13; Ps. 120:5.</i> who live in tents.

Verse 20

WHETHER IT IS FAT. In producing wheat.

Verse 21



Verse 22

[AND CAME UNTO HEBRON.] Our sages of blessed memory said that <i>and came</i> refers to Caleb the son of Jephunneh,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 34b. Also see Rashi. <i>And came</i> (va-yavo) is in the singular. Hence the rabbinic interpretation.</i> for each one of the men went to a different part of the country.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Caleb could visit Hebron by himself.</i>
ZOAN IN EGYPT. Zoan is the name of a city in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>tzo’an mitzrayim</i> literally, Zoan Egypt. Now a proper name does not come in the construct. Hence I.E. points out that here it does, contrary to the rule. According to I.E. <i>tzo’an mitzrayim</i> is short for <i>tzo’an shel mitzrayim</i>, Zoan of Egypt.</i> <i>Of Beth-lehem Judah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Ruth 1:1)<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is Beth-lehem of Judah.</i> is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Here too two common nouns are in the construct, for Beth-lehem Judah is short for Beth-lehem of Judah.</i> Some say that the word <i>tzo’an</i> (Zoan) is connected to the word <i>yitzan</i> (be removed) in <i>A tent that shall not be removed</i> (Is. 33:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">These commentaries interpret <i>tzo’an mitzrayim</i> as meaning the establishment of Egypt</i> However, this is farfetched.
Scripture mentions Hebron in order to tell us that Hebron came into being before Zoan.

Verse 23

UNTO THE VALLEY OF ESHCOL. These are the words of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The valley of Eshcol was not yet so called when the spies came there. However, Moses called it by the name which the Israelites later used in referring to it.</i> It is possible that it is similar to <i>and pursued as far as Dan</i> (Gen. 14:14) in that it had another name.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Dan had two names, Dan and Layish (Jud. 18:29). However, Moses in writing the Torah used the name by which Israel referred to it. So too Nahal Eshcol had another name, and Moses used the name that the Israelites used. For other interpretations, see Filwarg and Meijler.</i>

Verse 24

WAS CALLED. <i>Kara</i> (was called) is to be rendered, someone called.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads, called that place Nahal Eshcol. Scripture omits the subject. Hence I.E. says that “called” is short for “the caller called,” that is, someone called.</i> Compare, <i>whom she bore to Levi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Num. 26:59).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Here too Scripture does not identify the subject. Thus <i>who she bore</i> has to be rendered whom somebody bore.</i>

Verse 25

[AT THE END.] The word <i>mi-ketz</i> (at the end) sometimes means at the beginning and sometimes means at the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 14:28; 31:10.</i> <i>Mi-ketz arba’im yom</i> (and the end of forty days) probably means at the start of the fortieth day.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Torah, God decreed that Israel spend a year in the desert for each day that the spies spent in Canaan. Now Israel spent 39 years in the desert (see Rashi on 14:33). Hence I.E. assumes that the spies spent 39 days in Canaan (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 26

AND THEY WENT. This informs us that they did not go to their tents, which were in the camp, but immediately went [to Moses, Aaron, and all the congregation].
AND BROUGHT BACK WORD. To Moses and Aaron.

Verse 27

AND THEY TOLD HIM. They told Moses, for he was the most important one.

Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

AND CALEB STILLED THE PEOPLE. Rabbi Jonah the grammarian says that the meaning of <i>va-yahas</i> (and…stilled) is: and he said be still (<i>hasu</i>).

Verse 31



Verse 32

AND THEY SPREAD AN EVIL REPORT OF THE LAND. <i>Va-yotzi’u dibbat ha-aretz</i> (and they spread an evil report) means: and they spread a lie. This is not the meaning of <i>va-yave yosef et dibbatam ra</i> (and Joseph brought evil report of them) (Gen. 37:2), for <i>va-yave</i> (brought) is the reverse of <i>va-yotzi</i> (and they spread).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">For there the report was true. In other words, when <i>dibbatam</i> follows <i>va- yave</i>, it refers to the truth. When it follows <i>va-yotzi</i>, it refers to a lie.</i>
EVIL REPORT. The word <i>dibbah</i> (evil report) comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>dalet, bet, bet</i>, even though it is spelled <i>dalet, bet, heh</i>, which, <i>prima facie</i>, appears to be its root.</i> It comes from the same root as the word <i>dovev</i> (moving gently) in <i>Moving gently the lips of those that are asleep</i> (Cant. 7:10). I have explained it in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, I.E. on Cant. 7:10, “<i>Dovev</i> means to speak. It is possible the word <i>dibbah</i> is similar.” In other words, both <i>dovev</i> and <i>dibbah</i> refer to speech.</i>
EATETH UP THE INHABITANTS THEREOF. For its air is bad.
MEN OF GREAT STATURE.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>anshe middot</i> (literally, men of measurements). Hence I.E.’s comments.</i> Every man is a man of measurements. <i>Anshe middot</i> means men of great measurement, men whose measurements are greater than everyone else’s.

TO RETURN INTO EGYPT. <i>Shuv</i> (to return) is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shuv</i> can also be an imperative.

THEIR DEFENSE IS REMOVED FROM OVER THEM.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, their shadow is removed from over them. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> For the heart of a warrior frets when he does not have a shield to protect him and to serve as a shade for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, their shadow means their shield. Thus according to I.E. our clause should be understood: their shield is removed from over them; that is, they have no confidence to fight us and they will not confront us with a sword and shield. See Nachmanides on this verse.</i>

Verse 10

BADE STONE THEM. Joshua and Caleb.

Verse 11

DESPISE ME. <i>Yena’atzuni</i> (despise me) means anger me. It has many cognates in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This word is found many times in Scripture.</i>
Scripture employs the singular <i>be-kirbo</i> (among them)<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>be-kirbo</i> (among them) literally means among him.</i> because at first they were united to do good.

Verse 12



Verse 13

WHEN THE EGYPTIANS SHALL HEAR–FOR THOU BROUGHTEST UP THIS PEOPLE. The meaning of <i>ki he’elita</i> (for thou broughtest up) is: that you brought up.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ki he’elita</i> is to be interpreted as if written <i>asher he’elita</i>. In other words, the <i>ki</i> (for) in our verse is to be rendered <i>asher</i> (that).</i> After Scripture states, <i>When the Egyptians shall hear</i> (ve-shame’u)…they <i>will say to the inhabitants of this land</i>, the reference being to the land of Canaan, it goes on to explain<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 14.</i> what the Egyptians heard. Scripture therefore repeats the word <i>shame’u</i> (have heard) and states they <i>have heard</i> (shame’u) <i>that Thou Lord</i> [Thy glory] <i>art in the midst of this people</i> (v. 14).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>shame’u</i> in verse 14 picks up the thought which was interrupted by <i>they will say to the inhabitants of the land</i>.</i>

Verse 14

ART SEEN FACE TO FACE. The reference is to the glory which the elders saw (Ex. 24:9,10), or to <i>the appearance of the glory of the Lord…in the eyes of the children of Israel</i> (Ex. 24:17). The latter is correct.
ART SEEN. The word <i>nirah</i> (seen) is a verb in the perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It is a third person perfect.

Verse 16

ABLE. The word <i>yekholet</i> (able) is a noun. It is similar to the word <i>yevoshet</i> (dried up) in <i>until the waters were dried up</i> (Gen. 8:7). It does not mean a measure as in the midrashic interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A Midrash connects the word <i>yekholet</i> to the word <i>yakhil</i> (held a measure). See Kings I 7:26. According to Krinsky the reference is to <i>Midrash Tanhumah</i> on our verse.</i>
THEREFORE HE HATH SLAIN THEM IN THE WILDERNESS. The meaning of <i>va-yishchatem</i> is, He hath slain them. Scripture employs the term <i>va-yishchatem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Which usually applies to the slaughter of cattle.</i> because sheep graze in the wilderness.

Verse 17

LET THE POWER OF THE LORD BE GREAT. <i>Let the</i> power…be <i>great</i> connotes being slow to anger, for all who are long-suffering have the great power to break their anger. <i>As Thou hast spoken</i>, that you are slow to anger<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>As Thou hast spoken, saying</i> (v. 17): <i>The Lord is slow to anger</i> (v. 18).</i> is proof of this.

Verse 19

PARDON, I PRAY THEE. Since we find Scripture saying <i>surely they shall not see the land</i> (v. 23) after <i>salachti ke-devarekha</i> (I have pardoned according to thy word) (v. 20), we learn that the term <i>salach</i> (pardon) refers to being slow to anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>salach</i> meant full pardon, then (he people would have been permitted to enter the land.</i> Similarly, the meaning of <i>ve-nislach lo</i> (and he shall be forgiven) (Num 15:28) is [the punishment shall be held in abeyance] until he fully repents.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Salach</i> in all cases means that punishment is not meted out immediately but is delayed. In the case of Num. 15:28, a sacrifice delays punishment and the person is pardoned if he truly repents.</i>
ACCORDING UNTO THE GREATNESS OF THY LOVINGKINDNESS. The meaning of <i>ke-godel chasdekha</i> (according to the greatness of Thy lovingkindness) is: because of Thy great lovingkindness.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kof</i> usually has the meaning of like or according. Hence I.E.’s comment that here it means because of.</i>
AND ACCORDING AS THOU HAST FORGIVEN. The word <i>nasata</i> (Thou hast forgiven) is similar to the word <i>nose</i> (forgiving) in <i>forgiving sin</i> (Ex. 34:7).
EVEN UNTIL NOW. Until this place or from the day that they left Egypt until this very day, for the word <i>hennah</i> (now) can refer to a place or to a specific time. Compare, <i>there came men in hither</i> (hennah) (Josh. 2:2) and, <i>and I have not seen him until now</i> (hennah) (Gen. 44:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> I have already explained this term.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>hennah</i> in Gen 44:28 refers to time.</i>

Verse 21

AS I LIVE. It means as I live, so shall My word come to pass.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>As I live</i> is short for, As I live, so shall my word come to pass.</i>
SHALL BE FILLED WITH THE GLORY. As My glory fills the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yimmale</i> (shall be filled) is to be taken as a present. Thus the meaning of our clause is, and all the earth is filled with the glory of the Lord.</i> However, it most probably refers to the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>yimmale</i> is an imperfect.</i> Its meaning is, I shall do this so that my glory shall be known in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the meaning of our clause is: and all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.</i>

Verse 22

The Levites and the <i>kohanim</i> are not included in the oath,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in verses 21-23.</i> for no prince from among them went to spy out the land. Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number</i> (v. 29).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture explicitly states that God’s decree was limited to those who were numbered.

Verse 33

In view of the belief of I.E. that God is unchangeable (see his comments on Gen. 6:6, Vol. 1, p. 96), the reading of <i>Vat.

Verse 44

BUT THEY PRESUMED TO GO UP. <i>Va-yapilu</i> (but they presumed) is related to the word <i>ofel</i> (mound) in <i>the mound and the tower</i> (Is. 32:14). The meaning of <i>va-yapilu</i> is, they went up the hill.

Verse 2

WHEN YE ARE COME INTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS. This chapter follows [the one dealing with the spies] in order to console the children by informing them that they would enter the land, for the Israelites grew weak and mourned.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 14:39. This interpretation is found in Rashi.</i> However, the real reason that this chapter follows the one dealing with the spies, is because all the congregation shouted and sinned.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 14:1-4.</i> God forgave their sin because of the prayer of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 14:13-21.</i> Scripture says, <i>And when ye shall err</i> (15:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which is precisely what Israel had just done.</i> <i>And they shall be forgiven</i> (15:25) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The theme connecting the chapters is atonement for sin.</i> Scripture found it necessary to mention the law of the meal offering and of all burnt offerings and sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture mentioned the sin offering and its accompanying meal and drink offering, it felt compelled to mention the same regarding the burnt and other offerings.</i> At the end,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">After mentioning the various offerings.</i> it states, <i>But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand</i> (v. 30). The latter alludes to Israel’s deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The incident of the spies.</i> Scripture mentions the gatherer of wood (verses 32-34)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">After the sin offering.</i> because he acted with a high hand. God designated the fringes as a sign<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Of the commandments.</i> because of His great pity on Israel, so that a person will not act with a high hand or<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Deliberately violate God’s commandments.</i> forget.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Any of God’s commands. <br>While I.E. maintains an independent position regarding Biblical interpretations, he always defers to the sages of the Talmud on <i>halakhic</i> issues. Thus in regard to the law concerning fringes, I.E. notes it is possible that Biblical rules require that the corners of garments be left unwoven so that their threads hang down to form fringes. He further notes that the law of fringes applies to pants. However, he then goes on to say that this interpretation is of no consequence, for the rabbis say that the fringes are specially prepared threads which are placed on the corner of any garment having four corners. Therefore pants are not included in the law of fringes.</i>

Verse 3

CLEARLY UTTERED. <i>Le-fale</i> (clearly uttered) means to separate.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>le-fale neder</i> (in fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered) is to be rendered, in fulfillment of a vow set aside.</i> Similarly the word <i>ve-hiflah</i> (shall make a division) in <i>And the Lord shall make a division</i> (Ex. 9:4). This is so even though <i>ve-hiflah</i> is spelled with a <i>heh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">And <i>le-fale</i> is spelled with an <i>alef</i>.</i> for the letters <i>alef, heh, vav, yod</i> interchange.9.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The printed texts have verse 9.

Verse 11

THE HE-LAMBS. Or the kids.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This comment as it stands appears very difficult. First of all, what is I.E. adding to the Scriptural text, which reads: <i>for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids?</i> Furthermore, I.E. goes on to say, “Scripture similarly states at the end, <i>for each lamb</i>.” We do not find the phrase <i>for each lamb</i> in any of the following verses. Filwarg suggests that the heading verse 11 is an error and should be eliminated and that our note is a continuation of the previous one. It should read as follows:<br>[Verse 4.] A MEAL-OFFERING OF…FINE FLOUR. A tenth of an ephah for each one of the flock, (that is) he-lambs or kids. Scripture similarly states at the end (of the verse), <i>for each lamb</i> (v. 5). See note 15.</i> Scripture similarly states later, <i>for each lamb</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the term flock refers to lambs (and by extension also to kids).</i> If the celebrant offers a ram, then his meal offering is doubled,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> for a lamb is a small animal. Scripture does not mention the free-will offering<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>nedavah</i>.</i> along with the bullock.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 8.

Verse 13



Verse 14

Verse 15

AS FOR THE CONGREGATION. Some say that the <i>heh</i> prefixed to the word <i>kahal</i> (congregation) is the sign of the vocative.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation our verse reads: O congregation (<i>ha-kahal</i>), there shall be one statute both for you, and for the stranger.</i> However, I believe that there is no vocative letter in the holy tongue.

AS YE ARE, SO SHALL THE STRANGER BE. I have already explained the rule governing two <i>kafs</i> joined together.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. when two <i>kafs</i> are affixed to two words following each other it indicates an abridged clause. Thus our verse, which states <i>ka-khem ka-ger</i> (as you are, so shall the stranger be) is to be interpreted: as you are, so shall the stranger be; as the stranger is, so shall you be. See I.E. on Gen. 44:18 (Vol. 1, p. 396).</i>

Verse 16

[ONE LAW.] Its meaning is, one law aside from the burnt offerings, for the burnt offerings are obligated by statute.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For that is what the word <i>chukkah</i> (statute) refers to. Verse 15 states, <i>there shall be one statute</i> (chukkah) <i>both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you</i>. Verse 16 states, <i>One law</i> (Torah) <i>and one ordinance shall be both for you, and for the stranger. Prima facie</i>, Scripture is redundant. Hence I.E. comments that verse 15 deals with that which is obligatory, namely, the burnt offering (for it concludes the law mentioned in verse 14, which deals with sacrifices), and verse 16 deals with all the other commandments, for it speaks of Torah (Filwarg).</i> God also says,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 19-21.</i> as you bring a meal offering of fine flour along with the burnt offering, thus shall you do with your dough.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">One must set aside a portion of one’s dough as a gift unto God. Hence the law of <i>hallah</i> follows the law of the meal offering.</i> There is no need to mention what our ancients, of blessed memory, received by tradition, namely, that one is obligated to set aside two offerings, a portion of the dough<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hallah</i>.</i> and a portion of the grain,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Terumah</i>.

The reference is to the he-goat.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>An offering made by fire unto the Lord</i> refers to the bullock, <i>and their sin-offering before the Lord</i> refers to the he-goat.</i> A <i>sei’r izzim</i> (he-goat) refers to a young goat because the word <i>se’ir</i> (he-goat) is connected to <i>izzim</i> (goats).

THAT THEY MAKE THEM…FRINGES.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tzitzit</i>.</i> It is possible to interpret this in two ways.

IN THE CORNERS OF THEIR GARMENTS. Upon smooth garments<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Such as a sheet.</i> or pants,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">This is still part of the first interpretation.</i> for if pants are divided they will have corners.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they require fringes now (Krinsky).</i>
A THREAD OF BLUE. Upon the fringes. The reason the thread was blue is that blue is a sky-like color.

Verse 39

AND IT SHALL BE UNTO YOU FOR A FRINGE. The thread at the end was like the fringe.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The blue thread that was placed on the edge of the garment was to resemble one of the loose hanging threads.</i> The other interpretation is the one which the rabbis of blessed memory transmitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">That the fringes are not part of the garment but are attached to the corners of the garment.</i> Now the first interpretation is nullified in view of the fact that there are true witnesses<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Jewish practice throughout the ages.</i> to the second explanation. The rabbis transmitted to us the law that this commandment applies to a garment that has four corners and that the tzitzit are fringes.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Hanging from but not part of the garment.</i> I will explain this law later.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The reference apparently is to I.E.’s commentary on Deut. 22:11.</i> Now this commandment states that everyone who has a four-cornered garment shall always cover himself with it during the day. He shall not remove it so that he remembers<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. <i>Mikro’ot Gedolot</i> reads, so that they remember.</i> the commandments. Those who pray with a <i>tallit</i> during the time of prayers do so because they read in the <i>shema</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>shema</i> is part of the morning and evening prayers.

However, I believe that one is more obligated to enwrap oneself in fringes when he is not at prayer than during the time of prayer, so that he remembers the commandments and does not err and trespass during the other hours of the day, for in the hour of prayer he will not sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">“Now, the person who envelops himself in a tallit [during prayer] does not fully observe the commandment. In reality, one is obligated to wear fringes the entire day, for when a person is in the market and his eyes wander, his heart lusts after what his eyes see much more than it does during prayer.” See <i>The Secret of the Torah</i>, p. 79.</i>
THAT YE MAY LOOK UPON IT. The commandment requires that the fringes be seen.
AFTER YOUR OWN HEART. Which lusts. The eye sees and the heart desires. The fringes thus serve as a sign and a mark that a person should not pursue the thoughts of his heart and all that his eyes desire.
AFTER WHICH YE USE TO GO ASTRAY. For one who follows his desires goes astray from the service of his God.

This event occurred in the wilderness of Sinai when the first-born were set aside<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From serving as priests.</i> and the Levites were placed in their stead.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 32:29 (Vol. 1, p. 680).</i> Israel thought that our master Moses acted out of his own will in giving his brother an elevated position. They suspected that he acted similarly towards the sons of Kohath, who were his relatives, and to all the sons of Levi who were of his family. The Levites rebelled against Moses because they were subservient to Aaron and his sons. Dathan and Abiram rebelled because Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Actually Jacob did so on his death bed. However, Moses enforced Jacob’s decree. Hence Dathan and Abiram blamed Moses.</i> removed the birthright from Reuben their forefather, and gave it to Joseph. It is also possible that they suspected that Moses favored the tribe of Joseph because Joshua was his assistant.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua was descended from Ephraim the son of Joseph.</i> Korah too was a first-born, as Scripture clearly states.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 6:21.</i> The banner of Reuben camped in the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 2:10.</i> So did Korah, for he was a Kohathite.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The family of Kohath camped south of the tabernacle. See Num. 3:29. Thus these two disgruntled factions camped next to each other. Their proximity facilitated their rebellion.</i> The princes of the congregation were first-born. They offered the burnt offering. They therefore took the fire pans. The miracle of the staff,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The blossoming of the staff of Levi. See Num. 17:23.</i> which demonstrated to all of Israel that God chose the Levites in place of the first-born, is proof that this explanation is correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">That the rebellion was triggered by the rejection of the first-born, for otherwise why demonstrate that God chose the Levites.</i> Hence Scripture reads, <i>that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me</i> (Num. 17:25), for the murmuring was an account of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The substitution of the Levites for the first-born.</i> Moses also said, <i>that I have not done them of mine own mind</i> (v. 28). He said the aforementioned because Israel had come to believe that he had acted on his own. Furthermore, Moses said, <i>then the Lord hath not sent me</i> (v. 29) in this thing,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">To have the <i>kohanim</i> take the place of the first-born and the Levites be subservient to the <i>kohanim</i>.</i> because Israel had come to believe in him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses acted in accordance with God’s command in all other things. “In this thing” is part of I.E.’s interpretation of <i>the Lord hath not sent me</i>. It does not appear in the verse.</i> Here is another rigorous proof: <i>seeing all the congregation are holy</i> (v. 3). The aforementioned alludes to the first-born who are holy, for Scripture states, <i>Sanctify unto Me all the first-born</i> (Ex. 13:2). The first-born were the priests <i>that come near to the Lord</i> (Ex. 19:22). They were the most important ones of the congregation.
NOW KORAH…TOOK. This is short for, now Korah took men.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The word men is not in the Hebrew text. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Compare, <i>an ass bread</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (I Sam. 16:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>An ass bread</i> is short for an ass carrying bread.</i> There are many such instances in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Where a word is left out of the text.</i> Rabbi Jonah says that the meaning of <i>Now Korah took</i> is now Korah took himself to rise against Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Jonah connects <i>Now Korah…took</i> (v. 1) to <i>and they rose up</i> (v. 2).</i>

Verse 2

IN THE FACE OF MOSES. They did not rise up in secret. There is a difference between <i>li-fene</i> (in the face of) and <i>mi-pene</i> (before the face of) (Gen. 3:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mi-pene</i> is the respectful form. Compare, <i>mi-pene sevah takkum</i> (thou that rise up before the hoary head) (Lev. 19:32).</i>
THE ELECT MEN OF THE ASSEMBLY. They were called to the tent of meeting.
MEN OF RENOWN. Before they left Egypt.A grammarian says that <i>the princes of the congregation</i> are the leaders who stood over those that were numbered (Num 1:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This grammarian, unlike I.E., does not identify the princes of the congregation with the first-born.</i> He says that they<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The princes.</i> are the object of took. Our text should be read as if written, And Korah and Dathan and Abiram and On took the princes of Israel to speak to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">To convince them to join the revolt. This commentator reads our text as follows: Now Korah…and Dathan and Abiram…and On…and two hundred and fifty took the princes of the congregation, the elect men of the assembly, men of renown.</i> This interpretation is a bit far-fetched.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The interpretation that the princes were the heads who stood over Israel when they were numbered.</i>

Verse 3

YE TAKE TOO MUCH UPON YOU. Enough for you. <sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>rav lakhem</i> is, a lot to you.</i> Its meaning is, you have grabbed the greater portion.
SEEING ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY. For the entire congregation became holy from the day they stood on Sinai.
AND THE LORD IS AMONG THEM. For the Levites were chosen after God’s glory dwelt amidst the children of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">At Mt. Sinai.</i> Now if Moses knew when he was on Mount Sinai that the tribe of Levi was chosen, Israel did not know.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Thus they suspected that Moses acted on his own.</i>
WHEREFORE THEN LIFT YE UP YOURSELVES ABOVE THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD? For Aaron to be <i>kohen gadol</i> (high priest) and Moses, who taught Aaron, to be above him.

Verse 4

HE FELL UPON HIS FACE. Willingly. Other say, like prophets when they receive a prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>he fell upon his face</i> means he fell into a prophetic trance. See Num. 24:4.</i>

Verse 5

WHO ARE HIS. Which is the chosen tribe. This was Moses’ answer to Dathan and Abiram and to the leaders of the congregation who were first-born.
AND WHO IS HOLY. In his tribe to be <i>kohen gadol</i>.

Verse 6

THIS. Test.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>This do</i>. According to I.E. this is short for this test do.</i>

Verse 7

YE TAKE TOO MUCH UPON YOU, YE SONS OF LEVI. The meaning of our clause is found in the following words of Moses: <i>Is it but a small thing unto you</i> (v. 9).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 9 and 10 explain what Moses meant by <i>ye take too much upon you</i>.</i> Scripture says, <i>And Moses said unto Korah</i> (v. 8),<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5 reads, <i>And he</i> [Moses] <i>spoke unto Korah</i>. Thus <i>And Moses said unto Korah</i> appears redundant. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> for the first statement<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> was addressed to Korah and to all of his company. However, this one was addressed to the Levites.

Verse 8



Verse 9

IS IT BUT A SMALL THING UNTO YOU.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ha-me’at mi-kem</i> literally, is it small from you. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> This means is it but a small thing unto you.
BEFORE THE CONGREGATION TO MINISTER UNTO THEM. When they bring their burnt offerings and sacrifices.

Verse 10

AND THAT HE HATH BROUGHT THEE NEAR. And when he has brought you and your brothers near, will you seek the priesthood also?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That is, and now that he has brought you and your brothers near Him, you also seek the priesthood? In other words, the <i>vav</i> prefixed to <i>va-yakrev</i> is not to be rendered <i>and</i> but rather as <i>when</i>.</i>

Verse 11

THEREFORE. Therefore you and your whole congregation that art gathered together, rebel against the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>al Adonai</i> means against the Lord, and is to be interpreted as rebel against the Lord. The literal meaning of <i>al Adonai</i> is on the Lord. Thus the literal meaning of our verse is: Therefore you and your whole congregation that are gathered together on the Lord (<i>al ha-Adonai</i>). Hence, I.E.’s comment.</i> Its meaning is similar to <i>And the rulers take counsel together, Against the Lord</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>al Adonai</i> (literally on the Lord). However, its meaning is against the Lord.</i> <i>and against His anointed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-al meshicho</i> (literally, and on His anointed). However, its meaning is, <i>and against His anointed</i>.</i> (Ps. 2:2). They gathered in order to fight with God. <i>When they strove against the Lord</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>al Adonai</i>.</i> (Num. 26:9) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Here too <i>al</i> has the meaning of against.</i> Some say that the <i>heh</i> prefixed to <i>no’adim</i> (gathered together) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>ha-no’adim</i> (that art gathered together) is to be read <i>no’adim</i> (gathered together). If the <i>heh</i> is not superfluous, then our verse is to be interpreted, <i>Therefore thou and all thy company that are gathered together</i> (ha-no’adim) <i>against the Lord</i>. If the <i>heh</i> is superfluous, then our verse reads: Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered (<i>no’adim</i>) together against the Lord.</i>
AND AS TO AARON, WHAT IS HE. What is his sin, what did he do?

Verse 12

WE WILL NOT COME UP. It is possible that the tent of meeting was on a high place in the middle of the camp.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>We will not come up</i> is to be taken literally.</i> Scripture therefore says, <i>Get you up from about</i> (v. 24). On the other hand, one who goes to serve God or to the chosen place is said to go up.

Verse 13

IS IT A SMALL THING. Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey?Scripture reads, <i>brought us up</i>, because Egypt is south of the Land of Israel, and one who comes from Egypt to the land of Canaan is in truth going up.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Here, <i>brought us up</i> is to be taken literally.</i>
BUT THOU MUST NEEDS MAKE THYSELF ALSO A PRINCE OVER US. You brought us out of Egypt in order to make yourself a prince over us.
MUST NEEDS MAKE THYSELF A PRINCE OVER US. You and your brother also seek additional positions of power over us.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Our clause reads, <i>ki tistarer alenu gam histarer</i> (but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us). The latter literally reads: That you want to rule over us, also to rule. I.E. interprets this as follows: that you want to rule over us, and you also want additional rulership.</i>

Verse 14

MOREOVER THOU HAST NOT BROUGHT US UNTO A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. Its meaning is: You brought us out of a good place.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> Now if you had brought us to a place which is as good as the place you took us out of, and if you had given us fields and vineyards such as we had in Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. our verse implies that Israel had fields and vineyards in Egypt.</i> and you sought power over us, then we would tolerate it. However, you removed us from a good place, from our fields and vineyards, and you did not bring us to a place as good as the one that you brought us out of. Why then do you seek power?<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i>
WILT THOU PUT OUT THE EYES OF THESE MEN? Its meaning is: you want to put out the eyes of these men. This alludes to those who left Egypt. It is as if Korah said, you want to put out their eyes so that they do not see. But what you did is visible to the eyes. Therefore we will not come up. It is metaphoric to say so and so’s eyes are closed and he therefore cannot see.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Even when the subject’s eyes are open. Similarly, <i>wilt Thou put out the eyes of these men</i> is not to be taken literally.</i> Others say its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>Wilt thou put out the eyes of these men</i>?</i> is: Do you want to darken the eyes so that they do not see? In other words, you are fooling us. We will not come up.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i>, this interpretation seems to be identical to the one above. Hence Filwarg suggests that this interpretation is that <i>We will not go up</i> means we will not go up to the Land of Israel. In other words, Korah said you are fooling us, for you have no intention of bringing us to the Land of Israel.</i> Others say its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>Wilt thou put out the eyes of these men</i>?</i> is: even if you put out our eyes we will not go up. Korah said <i>of these men</i> because he spoke in the manner of the unintelligent, who do not want to say anything negative about themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>of these men</i> refers to Korah himself. According to this interpretation the meaning of <i>wilt thou put out the eyes of these men</i> is, will you put out my eyes?</i> However, I believe that <i>of these men</i> alludes to the elders who were with Moses, for Scripture clearly states, <i>and the elders of Israel followed him</i> (v. 25).

Verse 15

AND MOSES WAS VERY WROTH. With what Korah said.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>va-yichar le-mosheh me’od</i> (and Moses was very wroth). The latter literally reads, and to Moses it was wroth very much. I.E. suggest that this be interpreted, <i>va-yichar le-mosheh zeh ha-dibbur me’od</i> (and Moses was very wroth at this statement).</i>I have already explained that the burnt offering and the meal offering put off the punishment of the wicked. Dathan and Abiram were important men and offered meal offerings before this event. This is the meaning of <i>Respect not their offering</i> and turn to me, for I have not placed a burden upon one ass of their asses.
[I HAVE NOT TAKEN ONE ASS FROM THEM.] I have not placed a burden upon one of their asses.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>nasati</i> (taken) as laden.</i>
NEITHER HAVE I HURT ONE OF THEM. In any way.

Verse 16

AND MOSES SAID UNTO KORAH. Moses had already said so.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 6 and 7, Moses had already told them to take censers.</i> Thus this means: when Moses said to Korah be before God, they took their fire-pan.
TOMORROW. This occurred on the day that Moses called to Dathan and Abiram.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 12.</i> It is possible that he called them earlier. The latter appears correct because Scripture reads, <i>in the morning</i> (v. 5).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5 tells us that Korah and his men were to bring the fire-pans as soon as morning came. This being the case, there would be very little time for Dathan and Abiram to be called.</i>

Verse 17



Verse 18

WITH MOSES AND AARON. Moses and Aaron with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Our clause literally reads, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting and Moses and Aaron.</i>

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

SEPARATE YOURSELVES. For they<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Moses and Aaron.</i> were with them in front of the entrance to the tent of meeting.

Verse 22

AND THEY FELL UPON THEIR FACES. To pray.
[O GOD.] The term <i>El</i> (God) indicates that God has the power to destroy them in a moment.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>El</i> is mighty. See I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</i> God is <i>the God of the spirits</i>. This<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase <i>the God of the spirits</i>.</i> explains the term <i>El</i>, for God can destroy them because their spirits are in His hand.
SHALL ONE MAN SIN. The reference<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>One man</i>.</i> is to <i>Korah</i>, who assembled all of the congregation against Moses and Aaron. There are those who say that the meaning of <i>O God, the God of the spirits</i> is: God has the power to investigate human souls, for He is their God. God knows that one man, namely, Korah alone, sinned. He also knows if he [Korah] caused the others to sin.I believe that <i>Separate yourselves from among this congregation</i> refers to Korah and his congregation.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the congregation spoken of is Korah’s congregation, not the congregation of Israel.</i> A fire went out and devoured and destroyed them in one moment.

Verse 23



Verse 24

THE DWELLING OF KORAH. I believe that Korah had a tent for his household and his wealth. This tent was far from the camp of the Levites. The tents of Dathan and Abiram were close to Korah’s tent, for only Levites camped around the tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the need for the interpretation that Korah had a tent outside the camp of the Levites.</i> We learn from this verse that the bearer of the banner<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The tribe that carried the banner. For the banners, see Num. 2:1-34.</i> camped close to the camp of the Levites.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Korah’s tent was close to the tent of Dathan and Abiram. The Levites camped around the southern, western, and northern sides of the tabernacle (Num. 3:14-38). The Israelites camped around the four sides of the tabernacle (Num. 2:2). The family of Kohath camped on the south side (Num. 3:29). So did the tribe of Reuben (Num. 2:10). Now Korah’s tent was close to the tent of Dathan and Abiram, who came from the tribe of Reuben, because the tribe of Reuben bore the banner of the tribes that camped on the south and were thus close to the Levites.</i>

Verse 25

AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL FOLLOWED HIM. I believe that the reference is to the chosen seventy elders.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 11:16.</i>

Verse 26

AND TOUCH NOTHING OF THEIRS. For if one comes to save their money they will go down to the pit like them.
IN ALL THEIR SINS. Because of all their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>bet</i> before the word <i>be-khol</i> (in all) is to be rendered because. Thus <i>be-khol chatotam</i> (in all their sins) means because of all their sins.</i>

Verse 27

AND THEIR SONS. The reference is to adults.
AND THEIR LITTLE ONES. Male and female minors.

Verse 28

TO DO ALL THESE WORKS. To have the Levites take the place of the first-born. Note, it is a major and grievous act to the one who does not believe that God ordered the first-born to be removed from their position as <i>kohanim</i> and to have this status conferred only upon the family of Moses. All of this was done<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The first-born were removed and the Levites substituted in their place.</i> because of the incident of the golden calf, because <i>and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings</i> (Ex. 32:6) speaks of the first-born who offered these sacrifices, for they alone were the <i>kohanim</i>. Also, the sons of Levi<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Alone.</i> killed those who served the calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The first-born did not join Moses in extirpating the worshippers of the calf. Thus the first-born showed themselves unfit to be <i>kohanim</i>.</i> There is a question here.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">It isn’t clear what the question is. I believe it to be the issue of God changing His mind. According to medieval Jewish philosophy, God and His mind are one. Thus God’s mind is immutable. This being the case, how could He change His mind regarding the fitness of the first-born to serve as priests?</i> Its answer is found in the Torah portion which opens with the words <i>va-yelekh mosheh</i> (Deut. 31:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. there explains that God does not change. It is people who do. See I.E. on Deut. 31:16. Here I.E. is probably hinting that it wasn’t God who changed His mind but rather the first-born who changed by becoming unfit to serve as <i>kohanim</i>.</i>

Verse 29



Verse 30

BUT IF THE LORD MAKE A NEW THING. Some say that the word <i>beri’ah</i> (a new thing) refers to the bringing forth of something that was never in existence.I have already explained that the word <i>beri’ah</i> is related to the word <i>u-vara</i> (hack) in <i>and hack them</i> (Ezek. 23:47).<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, pp. 22,23).</i> Many cities<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Or countries. The text reads <i>medinot</i>.</i> have been split open, and those who dwelt in them have gone down to the pit.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is apparently to earthquakes.</i> The meaning of <i>bara</i> is to cut.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Thus according to I.E., <i>ve-im beri’ah yivra Adonai</i> (But if the Lord make a new thing) should be interpreted, but if God shall certainly split. An alternative interpretation of I.E. is: The meaning of <i>bara</i> is to decree. According to this interpretation I.E. renders <i>ve-im beri’ah yivra Adonai</i> (but if the Lord make a new thing) as, but if God shall decree.</i>
AND THE GROUND OPEN HER MOUTH. The word <i>u-fatzetah</i> means and opened. Compare, <i>yiftzeh</i> (doth open) in <i>doth open his mouth</i> (Job 35:16).I have already hinted<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:26 (Vol. 1, p. 45).</i> that man’s highest soul,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The rational soul. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 25). I.E. believes that man has three souls, a vegetable, an animal and a rational soul. I.E. refers to the soul as “her” for the Hebrew word for soul is <i>neshamah</i>, which is a feminine noun.</i> which comes from the intermediary world,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">For the three worlds, see I.E. on Ex. 3:15 (Vol. 2, pp. 86-90).</i> employs human language when speaking of things above her,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Such as when speaking of God.</i> for the body is its palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Here on earth. Hence it must employ corporeal metaphors. It is philosophically significant that I.E. refers to the body as a palace for the soul.</i> It similarly employs human language when speaking of things below her.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the earth. Hence Scripture reads, <i>and the ground open her mouth</i>.</i> It does so in order that people understand her.

Verse 31



Verse 32

AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. This is a general term for their wives, [grown] children, and their little ones.
AND THEIR GOODS.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the goods.</i> Which all of them possessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>the goods</i> is short for all the goods which they possessed.</i>

Verse 33

SO THEY…WENT DOWN. Its meaning is: when they went down, the earth closed and they were not seen.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i>, this verse repeats verse 32. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
AND THE EARTH CLOSED UPON THEM. The earth itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The verb <i>va-tekhas</i> (and closed upon then) literally means and covered. Our clause thus reads, and the earth covered them. Hence <i>va-yekhas</i> may be taken as transitive. In this case, it means that the earth covered them with something. Hence I.E. points out that <i>va-yekhas</i> is intransitive.</i>
AND THEY PERISHED. For their children who were to take their place died.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">One who dies without descendants perishes from the face of the earth.</i>

Verse 34

AT THE CRY OF THEM. Because of their cry.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>lamed</i> prefixed to <i>kolam</i> (their voice) means because of. The <i>lamed</i> usually means to.</i>

Verse 35

[AND FIFTY MEN.] The <i>heh</i> of <i>ha-chamishim</i> (the fifty) is to be read as if written twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">It is also to be placed in front of the word <i>u-matayim</i> (and…fifty men). Our text, which reads <i>ha-chamishim u-matayim</i>, should be read as if written, <i>ha-chamishim ve-ha-matayim</i> (and…the two hundred and fifty men). The latter is the correct grammatical construction. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Some say that Korah was among the ones who were swallowed. They offer as proof, <i>And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah</i> (Num. 26:10). Others say that Korah was burned. They offer, <i>with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) as proof. Our sages say that Korah was burned and swallowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">San. 110:a.</i>I believe that only the place of Dathan and Abiram split open,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it was only Dathan and Abiram and their families who were swallowed by the ground.</i> for no other place is mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not mention that any other place split open.</i> Korah was standing with his fire-pan with Aaron and the leaders of the congregation who were offering incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">And were consumed by fire.</i> <i>With Korah</i> (Num. 26:10) is not connected to <i>and swallowed them up</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) but rather to <i>when that company died</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.). This is the way the aforementioned verse is to be interpreted. If someone should argue and say, “Why isn’t Korah mentioned among those who were burned?” the answer is: once Scripture mentions that Korah’s company, which came to his aid, was burned, it is not necessary to mention Korah. For we know this by arguing from a minor to a major premise.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">If Korah’s followers were burned, then Korah certainly was.</i> <i>Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea</i> (Ex. 15:4) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">In that by employing a similar argument, we learn from this verse that Pharaoh died.</i> Moses does not mention in the song<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The song of Moses wherein <i>Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea</i> is stated.</i> that Pharaoh drowned. The truth is that Pharaoh drowned, for Scripture explicitly states, <i>But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea</i> (Ps. 136:15). The verse <i>that he fare not as Korah, and as his company</i> (Num. 17:5) is proof that Korah was among those who were burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">For the term company refers to the 250 men who were consumed by fire.</i>

EVEN THE FIRE-PANS OF THESE MEN WHO HAVE SINNED. This explains <i>the fire-pans</i> (v. 2).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The fire-pans</i> in verse 2 refers to the fire-pans of <i>these men who have sinned</i>.</i>
AND LET THEM BE MADE.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-asu otam</i> (literally, and they shall make them).</i> The reference is to the workers.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, and they shall make them means and the workers shall make them.</i>
BEATEN PLATES. Compare, <i>And they did beat</i> (ve-yerakke’u) <i>the gold into thin plates</i> (Ex. 39:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>reku’e</i> (beaten) in our verse is similar in meaning to <i>va-yerakke’u</i> (and they did beat).</i>
[FOR THEY ARE BECOME HOLY.] <i>Because they were offered before the Lord</i> explains <i>for they are become holy</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads, because they were offered before the Lord <i>and</i> they are become holy. I.E. believes this should be interpreted as if written, for they are become holy <i>because</i> they were offered before the Lord.</i>
THAT THEY MAY BE A SIGN. A memorial and a mark.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, “For a memorial, that people will always say: These plates were from those who disputed the priesthood and were burnt.”</i>

Verse 4

AND THEY BEAT THEM OUT. The beaters beat them out.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The subject is omitted. Hence I.E.’s comment. See I.E. on verse 3.</i>

Verse 5

AS THE LORD SPOKE UNTO HIM BY THE HAND OF MOSES. <i>Unto him</i> (lo) refers to Aaron. Others say that <i>unto him</i> refers to Korah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>San</i>. 110a.</i> However, I believe the latter to be farfetched.

Verse 6

ON THE MORROW. Of this day, for <i>mochorat</i> (morrow) is always connected to the previous day.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it always refers to the next morrow. I.E. comments thus, for the word <i>machar</i> (morrow) can refer to a morrow in the far future.</i>
YE HAVE KILLED. Its meaning is, what proof is this<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that the 250 men who offered the incense were burned.</i> that the tribe of Levi is the chosen one, and that Aaron was chosen to be <i>kohen gadol</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">High priest.</i> It is possible that those who offered the fire-pans were burned because of your prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">You prayed that they be burned.</i> or through your knowledge of the sciences.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">You may have arranged for some combustible material to be mixed with the incense.</i>

Verse 7

WHEN THE CONGREGATION WAS ASSEMBLED.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>be-hikkahel</i>.</i> Whenever the word <i>kehillah</i> (assembly)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a word from the root <i>kof, heh, lamed</i>.</i> is followed by the word <i>al</i> (on),<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As it does in our verse, which reads, <i>be-hikkahel ha-edah al mosheh ve-al aaron</i> (when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron). The word <i>al</i> usually means on, not against. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> it refers to an assembly for the sake of quarreling.

Verse 8

AND MOSES AND AARON CAME. Because they saw that God’s glory appeared.

Verse 9



Verse 10

GET YOU UP. For they sat in the tabernacle, which was on the high ground in the camp of the Levites, as I explained in my comments on <i>Get you up</i> (Num. 16:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently renders <i>herommu</i> (Get you up) as, remove yourself from the high place. He cites Num. 16:24, but he actually made his comments on 16:12.</i>
AND THEY FELL UPON THEIR FACES. To pray.

Verse 11

TAKE THY FIRE-PAN. The reference is to a specific fire-pan.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the word <i>machtah</i> (fire-pan) has the definite article <i>ha</i> prefixed to it. The literal meaning of <i>kach et ha-machtah</i> is, take the fire-pan. According to I.E. <i>the fire-pan</i> in our verse means the specific fire-pan used to offer incense (Krinsky).</i>
AND LAY INCENSE THEREON. Scripture does not say, and lay “the” incense on.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">“The” incense would refer to the incense usually burned in the tabernacle. Since the definite article is not prefaced to <i>ketroret</i> (incense), it refers to another incense.</i> The intelligent will understand.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between the two types of incense. Some of the commentators on I.E. believe that he was of the opinion that the incense used by Moses to stop the plague had the power to clean the air of pollutants that caused the plague (Krinsky, Filwarg).</i>
AND CARRY. The word <i>holekh</i> (and carry) is an imperative.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>hifil. Holekh</i> looks like a <i>kal</i> participle. In this case the word would mean goes or walks. However, the context negates such a rendering.

Verse 15

[AND AARON RETURNED.] <i>And Aaron returned</i> is connected to the section that follows,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15 is connected to verse 16.</i> even though it is separated.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>masorah</i>, verse 16 starts a new section.</i> I have already given you many such examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Where verses that are in different section are connected.

Verse 16



Verse 17

RODS. Some say that the rod of Levi is not God’s rod, for God’s rod was already known.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">According to this view the rod of the Lord (the rod employed by Moses to perform miracles in Egypt) was made of different material from that of the other rods.</i> Why then write Aaron’s name on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">If the rod of the tribe of Levi was God’s rod.</i> Others say that the rod<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">God’s rod.</i> was like the other rods. There was no difference between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">According to this view the rod of God was the rod of the tribe of Levi. In this opinion God’s rod was made of the same material as all the other rods. Hence it was necessary to write Aaron’s name on it (Filwarg).</i> This interpretation appears correct to me.
[ONE FOR EACH FATHER’S HOUSE.] Each father’s house means each tribe. Reuben and Simeon are examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Of tribes and fathers’ houses.</i>

Verse 18

[FOR THERE SHALL BE ONE ROD.] Scripture tells us that there shall be one rod for the tribe of Levi because this tribe was divided into <i>kohanim</i> and Levites.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hence one might think that each of these divisions has a separate rod.</i>

Verse 19

WHERE I MEET WITH YOU. Permanently.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture uses the future form (<i>ivva’ed</i>).</i>

Verse 20

I WILL MAKE TO CEASE. The word <i>ve-hashikkoti</i> (I will make to cease) comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>shin, kaf, kaf</i>.</i> It is similar to the word <i>ve-hatimmoti</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>tav, mem, mem</i>. Both words are <i>hifils</i>.</i> (and I will consume) in <i>and I will consume thy filthiness from out of thee</i> (Ezek. 22:15). It is related to the word <i>shakhakhah</i> (assuaged) in <i>then was the king’s wrath assuaged</i> (Esth. 7:10).<i>Ve-hashikkoti</i> (I will make to cease) means I [God] will find rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. our clause reads: I will find rest from the murmuring of the children of Israel.</i> Scripture employs human language.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">When a person is greatly bothered he says, I seek rest from those who trouble me.</i> The rod of Levi was among the twelve. Behold, the tribe of Joseph was represented by one rod.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The tribe of Joseph was divided into Manasseh and Ephraim. These are usually counted as two separate tribes. However, here they are not. Otherwise there would have been thirteen rods.</i>

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

FOR THE HOUSE OF LEVI. The word <i>matteh</i> (rod of) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Which literally reads, the rod of Aaron of the house of Levi.</i> is to be read as if written: the rod of Aaron, the rod of the house of Levi.
AND BORE RIPE ALMONDS. The word <i>va-yigmol</i> (and bore ripe) is related to the word <i>va-yigammal</i> (and was weaned) in <i>And the child grew, and was weaned</i> (Gen. 21:8). Many say that the rod<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Of the tribe of Levi.</i> came from an almond tree because the rod bore almonds. However, this is not proof. The word <i>shekedim</i> (almonds) has midrashically been related to the word <i>shoked</i> (watch) in I <i>watch over My word to perform it</i> (Jer. 1:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">God (watches) is quick to punish those who oppose the priesthood.

On the other hand, the clause may be taken at face value,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">That God spoke directly to Aaron.</i> because Aaron too was a prophet. Also, this section<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to Num. 16.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

THE INIQUITY OF THE SANCTUARY. Which is on the inside of the veil.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Which hung in front of the Holy of Holies. See Ex. 26:31-36 and Lev. 16:1-3.</i> Its meaning is, if you do not guard the sanctuary the sin is upon you.

THE INIQUITY OF YOUR PRIESTHOOD. If you do not keep the laws of the priesthood, the sin is upon you.

Verse 2

THE TRIBE OF THY FATHER. The reference is to Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father</i> is to be understood as the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your patriarch Levi.</i> Our sages say that <i>the tribe of thy father</i> is to be taken at face value.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reference being to Amram.</i> However, I believe that it is to be explained in keeping with my earlier interpretation. Our verse is to be read as if written, the tribe of Levi which is the tribe of your father.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Matteh levi shevet avikha</i> is to be read as if written, <i>matteh levi she-hu shevet avikha</i>.</i>
THAT THEY MAY BE JOINED. The meaning of <i>ve-yillavu</i> is similar to <i>ve-nispechu</i> (and they shall join) (Is. 14:1). So too the word <i>yillaveh</i> (be joined) in <i>Now this time will my husband be joined</i> (Gen. 29:34). Look, the Levites are joined by their names.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>bi-shemam</i>. Their name indicates that they have joined Aaron.

THOU AND THY SONS WITH THEE. You and your sons, and not the Levites, shall abide before the tent of meeting.

Verse 3

NEITHER THEY, NOR YE.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>gam hem, gam attem</i> (literally, also they, also you).</i> It is the way of Scripture to speak in this manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To say also…also… (<i>gam… gam…</i>).</i> Compare, <i>Rule thou over us, also you, also thy son</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Jud. 8:22). That means this one is like this one.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the same law applies to them and to you.</i>

Verse 4

[AND THEY SHALL BE JOINED UNTO THEE.] So that you do not need the services of a stranger, namely, an Israelite.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

AS A SERVICE OF GIFT. And someone who is a common man in regard to the priesthood even if he be a Levite [shall be put to death]. The burnt offering of Samuel, who was a Levi, is no argument<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That a person who is not a <i>kohen</i> may offer a burnt offering, for Samuel offered a burnt offering.

Verse 9

OF THE MOST HOLY THINGS. For there are offerings that have a lesser degree of sacredness.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Such as peace offerings.</i>
RESERVED FROM THE FIRE.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>esh</i>.</i> Of all that they sanctify,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">That they offer on the altar.</i> for <i>isheh</i> (fire-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A common term for a sacrifice.</i> and <i>esh</i> (fire) mean the same,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>reserved from the fire</i> (esh) means reserved from the fire offerings.</i> the <i>heh</i> of <i>isheh</i> being superfluous.
AND EVERY MEAL-OFFERING OF THEIRS. After they sanctify the memorial part thereof.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>azkarah</i>.

UNTO ME. The reference is to a trespass.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Money paid in restitution for the unauthorized use of sacred property (<i>me’ilah</i>).

Verse 10

IN A MOST HOLY PLACE SHALT THOU EAT THEREOF. Even in a most holy place, namely, in the tent of meeting shalt thou eat thereof. The tent of meeting is called a most holy place in contrast to the courtyard of the tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">However, it is not considered a most holy place in contrast to the Holy of Holies.

Verse 11

THEIR GIFT. A <i>tav</i> is missing in the word <i>mattanam</i> (their gift).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The usual Hebrew word for gift is <i>mattanah</i>. Thus the word for <i>their gift</i> should be <i>mattanatam</i> rather than <i>mattanam</i>.</i> <i>Mattanam</i> is similar to the word <i>pinnah</i> (corner), which has the meaning of <i>pinnatah</i> (her corner) in <i>Passing</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>over</i>.

Verse 12

ALL THE BEST OF THE OIL. <i>Chelev</i> (the best) means the most precious, the best.

Verse 13

THE FIRST-RIPE FRUITS OF ALL THAT IS IN THEIR LAND.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew literally reads: The first of all that is in their land. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The first of all the fruits of the ground.

Verse 18



Verse 19

COVENANT OF SALT. A “cut covenant.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical term for making a covenant is, to cut a covenant.

Filwarg claims that <i>hu</i> refers to the <i>kohen</i>. In this case, <i>But the Levites he</i> (hu) <i>shall do the service of the tent of meeting</i> should be interpreted: But the Levites shall do the service of him (the <i>kohen</i>) and of the tent of meeting.</i> However, this is incorrect, for the service of the tent of meeting is the object.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>ve-avad</i> (shall do the service).</i>

EVEN THE HALLOWED PART THEREOF. For the tenth part thereof is the holy part.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>the hallowed part thereof</i> refers to its tithe.</i>

Verse 30

[WHEN YE SET APART THE BEST THEREOF.] This has already been mentioned by Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous verse.</i> It is repeated in order to connect it to that which follows.

A RED HEIFER, FAULTLESS. The heifer is not to be small.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For the Bible speaks of a <i>parah</i> (cow), not of an <i>eglah</i> (heifer).</i> The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> says that <i>the water of sprinkling</i> (v. 13)<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Which cleansed the unclean but made the clean unclean.</i> is similar to honey, which is injurious to the one who has red bile<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In medieval medicine red bile was believed to cause a volatile nature.

Verse 3

AND SHE SHALL BE BROUGHT FORTH. Someone shall bring her forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>ve-hotzi otah</i> is: and he shall bring her forth. However, since Eleazar did not actually slaughter the cow, I.E. believes that he did not bring it out. Hence his comment.</i> Or it means he shall have her brought forth by his command.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it means he shall command that it be brought out.</i> The same applies to <i>ve-shachat</i> (and she shall be slain),<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Which literally means: and he shall slaughter it.</i> for Eleazar did not slaughter the heifer. The word <i>le-fanav</i> (before his face) proves the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">If Eleazar did the slaughtering, then what point would there be for Scripture to say “and he [Eleazar] shall slaughter it before his [Eleazar’s] face.”</i>

Verse 4



Verse 5

AND THE HEIFER SHALL BE BURNT IN HIS SIGHT. <i>Ve-saraf et ha-parah</i> (and the heifer shall be burnt)<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>ve-saraf et ha-parah</i> is: and he shall burn the cow.</i> is to be rendered, and someone shall burn the heifer. The term <i>le’enav</i> (in his sight)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Eleazar’s sight.</i> proves the latter interpretation.

Verse 6

CEDAR-WOOD. As in the case of a leper.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cedar wood was used in cleansing a leper (Lev. 14:4).</i> I have hinted there at some secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. points out that there is a connection between leprosy and death. Hence cedar is employed in cleansing someone who has been contaminated by contract with a leper or a dead body.</i>

Verse 7

THEN THE PRIEST SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES. The <i>kohen</i> who burns it.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i>, the reference is to the cow. However, in view of the fact that the latter is stated in the next verse, some say that the reference is to the cedar. See Filwarg and Krinsky.</i>
AND THE PRIEST SHALL BE UNCLEAN. The meaning of <i>ve-tame ha-kohen</i> (and the priest shall be unclean) is, and the <i>kohen</i> has already been unclean,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kohen</i> has been made unclean by performing the ritual. According to this interpretation the <i>vav</i> prefixed to <i>ve-tame</i> means “and.” Hence the meaning of <i>ve-tame ha-kohen</i> is: and the <i>kohen</i> was unclean.</i> or, as some say, the <i>kohen</i> shall be unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In this case <i>ve-tame</i> is a future form meaning: and he shall be unclean. The <i>vav</i> is a conversive <i>vav</i>.</i> <i>Until the even</i> refers to the eating of sacred food.

Verse 8



Verse 9

A MAN THAT IS CLEAN. The reference is not to the <i>kohen</i> who burns the cow.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Another <i>kohen</i> does this (Krinsky). According to the <i>Sifre</i> on this verse, any clean person, even if not a <i>kohen</i>, may gather the ashes of the red cow. However, I.E. seems to believe that this task was assigned to a <i>kohen</i>.</i>
A WATER OF SPRINKLING. The meaning of <i>niddah</i> (sprinkling) is distance.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The person who is unclean is distanced from the sanctuary. Thus <i>me-niddah</i> (water of sprinkling) means the water of the distant, i.e., the water to be used to purify the distant.</i> Compare, <i>me-naddekhem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Me-naddekhem</i> comes from the same root as <i>niddah</i>. When one hates another person, he keeps his distance from him.</i> (that hate you) (Is. 66:5).

Verse 10

AND BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. Once Scripture states that the gatherer of the ashes shall wash his clothes there is no need to mention that he shall wash in water.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture earlier linked the two. See verse 7.</i>
AND UNTO THE STRANGER THAT SOJOURNETH AMONG THEM. For the Land of Israel is holy because God’s glory is there.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Hence even a stranger (a non-Jew) must abide by this rule.</i>

Verse 11

EVEN ANY MAN’S DEAD BODY. Be it the body of a Jew or a non-Jew.
MAN’S…BODY. Not the body of an animal.
SHALL BE UNCLEAN. The meaning of <i>ve-tame</i> is, shall be unclean. It is a future form, for the <i>vav</i> changes the verb<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tame</i>, a third person perfect.</i> from a perfect to an imperfect. However, I believe that <i>ve-tame</i> is in the past tense.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Its <i>vav</i> being conjunctive. Thus the meaning of <i>ve-tame</i> is: and he was unclean. The import of our verse thus is: and after being unclean for seven days he shall purify himself. See I.E. on verse 7 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 12

THE SAME SHALL PURIFY HIMSELF THEREWITH. The meaning of <i>hu yitchate vo</i> (the same shall purify himself therewith) is, he shall remove his sin therewith.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">That is, by undergoing this ritual he will remove the potentiality of entering the sanctuary in a state of impurity and thus sinning. The word <i>chet</i> means sin. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> On the other hand, the word <i>yitchate</i> (shall purify himself) is similar to the word <i>techatteni</i> (purge me) in <i>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean</i> (Ps. 51:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yitchatta</i> means purify.</i> Those who are acquainted with the secret of numbers know that the number three is like the number seven.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The number seven has mystical significance in that seven days make up a lunar quarter. The number three is close to half of the number 7. See I.E. on Gen. 34:25 and the notes thereto (Vol. 1, p. 330).</i>

Verse 13

BECAUSE THE WATER OF SPRINKLING. Some say that that <i>me niddah</i> (the water of sprinkling) has the same meaning as <i>me niddah</i> (water of sprinkling) in <i>it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling</i> (Num. 31:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, both refer to water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer. Num. 31:23 deals with the purification of utensils captured from non-Jews. I.E. prefaces these remarks with “some say” because, according to the rabbis, Num. 31:23 refers to water in which a menstruant immerses herself.</i>
WAS NOT DASHED. The word <i>zorak</i> (dashed) refers to the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Even though <i>zorak</i> is singular and <i>me</i> (water of) is plural.</i>
IS YET. The word <i>od</i> (is yet) means continuously.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">He is continuously unclean until sprinkled.</i> Compare, <i>od</i> (while) in <i>While the earth remaineth</i> (Gen. 8:22).

Verse 14

IN A TENT. A house has the same law as a tent. Scripture mentions a tent because Israel then lived in tents. <i>That killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp</i> (Lev. 17:3) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The law laid down in Lev. 17:3 applies equally to a town.

AND EVERY THING THAT IS IN THE TENT. Garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For the next verse deals with vessels.</i>

Verse 15

COVERING CLOSE-BOUND. Two coverings.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads, <i>tzamid, petil</i> (close bound). According to I.E. each one of these terms refers to a covering. The <i>tzamid</i> goes over the opening, while the petil goes round about the above covering and the rim of the utensil (Krinsky). Others claim that I.E. believes that the cover is made of two parts. See Krinsky, Filwarg, and Weiser.</i>

Verse 16

OR A GRAVE. Of a human being.

Verse 17

AND FOR THE UNCLEAN THEY SHALL TAKE. See, Scripture explains how one who comes into contact with the dead shall purge himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Earlier, in verse 12, Scripture had said, <i>the same shall purify himself therewith</i>.

A CLEAN PERSON. The reference is most probably to a <i>kohen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>kohanim</i> are acquainted with the laws of purification.</i>

Verse 19



Verse 20

BUT THE MAN THAT SHALL BE UNCLEAN. Scripture has already mentioned, <i>Whosoever toucheth the dead…that soul shall be cut off from Israel</i> (v. 13). It now warns the one who touches a bone or a grave [not to defile the sanctuary].

Verse 21

SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL EVEN. And shall not become clean until he washes.

Verse 22

AND WHATSOEVER THE UNCLEAN PERSON TOUCHETH SHALL BE UNCLEAN. The reference is to one who has become unclean by touching a dead body, a bone, or a grave.

Chapter 20



Verse 1

IN THE FIRST MONTH. In the fortieth year.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Following the Exodus.</i> Look, the Torah does not contain any act or prophecy except in the first and the fortieth year.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture describes what happened in the first and the last year of Israel’s sojourn in the wilderness. What happened in the other years is ignored. Actually the Book of Numbers opens with a command to Moses in the second month of the second year. Filwarg explains that I.E. was not being precise. Some editions read, “except for the first year, the fortieth year.” The latter is to be interpreted as if written, and the fortieth year.</i>
[AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, EVEN THE WHOLE CONGREGATION, CAME.] Scripture states this because the generation that left Egypt died in the wilderness and they who were entering Canaan came to the desert of Zin.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase <i>even the whole congregation</i> appears to be unnecessary. I.E. says that it refers to those about to enter Canaan. They are now the complete congregation, for none of them need die in the wilderness. Rashi comments similarly.</i>
AND THE PEOPLE ABODE IN KADESH. For they dwelt there for many days.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture states, <i>and the people abode in Kadesh</i>, because they dwelt there for many days.</i> The latter is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 1:46, <i>So ye abode in Kadesh many days</i>.</i>

Verse 2

AND THERE WAS NO WATER FOR THE CONGREGATION. Scripture tells of two incidents.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That happened in Kadesh.</i> One, the death of Miriam. Two, the death of Aaron and Moses and their failure to enter the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. considers this one incident, for the latter was dependent upon the former.</i> It begins by telling the cause of the latter.

Verse 3

AND THE PEOPLE STROVE. <i>Va-yarev</i> (strove) is a <i>hifil</i>.
WHEN OUR BRETHREN PERISHED. <i>Bi-geva</i> (when…perished) is an infinitive. It is similar to <i>ki-shekav</i> (when…shall sleep) in <i>when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers</i> (I Kings 1:21).
OUR BRETHREN. The generation that died in the desert. They were servants of the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture states, <i>our brethren perished</i>. Why add, <i>before the Lord</i>? According to I.E., <i>before the Lord</i> indicates that they worshipped the Lord.</i>

Verse 4

AND WHY HAVE YE BROUGHT. This was addressed to Moses and Aaron, for Scripture goes on to say, <i>and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron</i> (v. 2).
Scripture reads, <i>And the people strove with Moses</i>, (v. 3) because their quarrel with Moses was more intense.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Than their quarrel with Aaron.</i>

Verse 5

HAVE YE MADE US TO COME UP. <i>He’elitunu</i> (have ye made us to come up) is irregular.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although this form is grammatically correct, it is not employed in Scripture (Weiser).</i>

Verse 6

AND MOSES AND AARON WENT<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, va-yavo’u. This literally means, and they came.</i> FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE ASSEMBLY. Like those who flee.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is to be rendered, And Moses and Aaron fled from the presence of the assembly. I.E. interprets thus because Scripture reads, <i>from the presence</i> (mi-pene) <i>of the assembly</i>. I.E. believes that the latter indicates that they fled.</i>
AND FELL UPON THEIR FACES. To pray. Other interpret, to prophetically inquire of God.

Verse 7



Verse 8

TAKE THE ROD. Many interpretations are offered for this incident.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of Moses and Aaron.</i> There is an individual opinion that Moses sinned because he said to Israel, who are the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: <i>Hear now, ye rebels</i> (v. 10). However, if this were the case why did he again say,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">After being punished.</i> <i>ye have been rebellious against the Lord</i> (Deut. 9:7). Others say that the word <i>ve-dibbartem</i> (and speak ye) has the meaning, and ye shall strike. It is similar to the word <i>va-tedabber</i> (and destroyed) in <i>and destroyed all the seed royal</i> (II Chron. 22:10). However, this is incorrect, for <i>va-tedabber</i> is related to the word <i>dever</i> (destruction) or to the word <i>yadber</i> (he subdueth) in <i>He subdueth peoples under us</i> (Ps. 47:4). <i>Va-tedabber</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In II Chron. 22:10.</i> thus means, and destroyed. Indeed, it so reads in the other book.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Its parallel in the Book of Kings. We read there, <i>and destroyed</i> (va-te’abbed) <i>all the seed royal</i> (II Kings 11:1).</i> The meaning of <i>ve-dibbartem el ha-sela</i> (and speak ye unto the rock) thus is,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation.</i> and ye shall destroy the rock.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Not, and you shall hit the rock.</i> Furthermore, if this is the meaning of the word,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>ve-dibbartem</i> means, and you shall strike.</i> why was Moses punished? The above commentaries answer, because he hit the rock twice. However, if this is the case why was Aaron punished?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron did not strike the rock.</i> Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard, of blessed memory, says that some signs<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Miracles.</i> are performed by word of mouth, others by action and speech, as in the case of the salt<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Some editions read <i>millat</i> (the incident of).</i> which Elisha cast into the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And he</i> (Elisha) <i>went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith the Lord: I have healed these waters; there shall be not be from thence any more death or miscarrying</i>, (II Kings 2:21).</i> God commanded Moses to take the staff and strike the rock as he did in the case of the rock [at Horeb].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 17:6.</i> He added the word <i>ve-dibbartem</i> (and speak ye)<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In our case.</i> so that the water would flow via the speech and the blow. Because Israel angered him, Moses said, are we to bring you forth water from the rock? What Moses meant<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">By <i>are we to bring you forth water out of the rock</i>?</i> was, we do not have the power to bring water out of the rock. We can only do so by the power of God. Now Moses did not make himself clear. People thought what he said was that God cannot bring water out of the rock. This is the meaning of <i>because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel</i> (Deut. 32:51). Rabbi Moses offered proof from the words of the poet who said, <i>For they embittered his spirit, And he spoke rashly with his lip</i> (Ps. 106:33). The sin was thus in his expressing, not by striking [the rock]. However, this too is incorrect, for Moses said, <i>are we to bring you forth water out of this rock</i> (v. 10). Why was Aaron punished?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">If Moses didn’t make himself understood.</i> Furthermore, no speech is mentioned in the Torah’s description of the act of striking the rock.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Thus a verbal pronouncement was not part of this event.</i> The proof offered<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">From Ps. 106:33.</i> by Rabbi Moses is no proof because the meaning of <i>For they embittered his spirit</i> is that they embittered God’s spirit. Scripture similarly writes, <i>But they rebelled, and grieved His holy spirit</i> (Is. 63:10). This is the meaning of <i>They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah</i> (Ps. 106:32). It means they angered God.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, “him” refers to God, not to Moses.</i> Scripture similarly states, <i>These are the waters of Meribah, where the children of Israel strove with the Lord</i> (Num. 20:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Thus “him” in <i>they angered Him also at the waters of Meribah</i>, refers to God.</i> Scripture says, <i>And it went ill with Moses because of them</i> (Ps. 106:32) because they embittered God’s spirit, and He decreed that Moses not enter the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of Ps. 106:32.</i> Others say that the meaning of speak to the rock can only mean strike the rock, for a rock cannot hear.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. appears to be referring to Rashbam. It should be noted that Rashbam answers I.E.’s question.</i> Now if this is so, why was Moses punished?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">He did what he was instructed to, viz., to strike the rock.</i> Some say that Moses and Aaron were punished because they did not sing a song of praise<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Unto the Lord for giving them water.</i> as in <i>Spring up, O well-sing ye unto it</i> (Num. 21:17). They say that this is the meaning of <i>because ye sanctified Me not</i> (Deut. 32:51).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is, you did not sing a song of praise to me.</i> Others say that God commanded Moses and Aaron to speak to the rock, but they did not speak to it. On the contrary, Moses struck the rock.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rashi. See Rashi on verse 11.<br>His interpretation is in keeping with the literal meaning of the text.</i> Therefore they were both punished and they were told, <i>ye trespassed</i> (Deut. 32:51); <i>ye rebelled</i> (v. 24); <i>ye believed not in Me</i> (v. 12), and <i>ye sanctified Me not</i> (Deut. 32:52). Those who are guided by reason<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">And do not take Scripture literally when it is opposes reason.</i> say that it is impossible that a messenger of God would alter God’s word.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">If God told Moses to speak to the rock, then Moses would not strike the rock.</i> If Moses transformed God’s word, how can we believe his Torah?<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">What assurance do we have that Moses did not alter the Torah?</i> However, the aforementioned<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Those who said that God told Moses to speak to the rock but that he struck the rock.</i> also spoke incorrectly, for if Moses had altered a commandment he would have been punished immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was not punished immediately. His punishment was delayed.</i> Look, Moses was punished with regard to something which was not an eternal commandment and not a law given to Israel. Nor did he knowingly violate God’s command. He only did so inadvertently because Israel angered him. Moses clearly said, <i>Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes</i> (Deut. 1:<i>37)</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that he was not punished for deliberately violating God’s command.</i> Others say that Israel told Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The text does not state this.

He was therefore punished.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For not striking the rock chosen by Israel.</i> This is the meaning of <i>ye believed not in Me</i> (v. 12). This interpretation is also incorrect, for Scripture states, <i>ye rebelled against My word</i> (v. 24). However, they did not rebel.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">For they struck the rock which God commanded them to strike.</i>I will reveal in hints the explanation which appears correct to me. Know, when the part<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">A person.</i> knows the All,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. often refers to God as the All. See I.E. on Gen. 1:26 (Vol. 1, p. 47). God is the creator of all. He is all. Also see I.E. on Ex. 33:21 (Vol. 2, p. 695).</i> he cleaves to the All and creates signs and wonders with the help of the All.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 33:21 (Vol. 2, p. 695).</i> Now it is true that God told Moses and Aaron, <i>speak ye unto the rock</i>. They did not speak to the rock because the people were quarreling with Moses. The “part” thus remained a “part.”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was distracted and his mind did not cleave unto God.</i> He struck the rock, and water did not come out of it<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Because he was not cleaving unto God.</i> until he struck it a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">His anger having been assuaged, Moses now cleaved unto God (Krinsky). This explanation is difficult. If Moses’ anger was assuaged, why didn’t he now speak to the rock?</i> Moses and Aaron thus did not sanctify God’s name. They inadvertently rebelled and trespassed. It is also possible to explain that <i>And he spoke rashly with his lips</i> (Ps. 106:33) refers to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">And not to God as previously explained.</i> It was unseemly for Moses to say anything<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Such as <i>Hear now, ye rebels</i>, etc. (v. 10).</i> before fulfilling God’s command. Moses was therefore punished. The midrashic interpretation of our ancients, of blessed memory, who said that Moses sinned because he said, <i>Hear now, ye rebels</i> (v. 10) is also in keeping with this interpretation. The rabbis hint at this secret.
UNTO THE ROCK. Which I pointed out to you or which is found close to the camp.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture speaks of <i>the</i> rock and not of <i>a</i> rock.</i>
THAT IT GIVE FORTH ITS WATER. Many erred and said that the rock is to be identified with the stone [at Horeb]<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 17:6.</i> because Scripture reads, <i>its</i> water.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than water. These commentaries assume that <i>its</i> water indicates that the stone had already produced water. See Bahya and <i>Da’at zekenim mi-ba’ale ha-tosafot</i>.</i> However, they cannot think straight. The stone was in Horeb and this rock was at the border of the land of Edom, for it was in Kadesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See verses 1 and 14.</i> It is also possible to interpret <i>its water</i> as meaning, the water which I will place in it.

Verse 9

THE ROD FROM BEFORE THE LORD. The reference is to the rod of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 4:20.</i> It was the rod which was placed before the testimony.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 17:1-24.</i>

Verse 10

ARE WE TO BRING YOU FORTH WATER OUT OF THIS ROCK? Do we have the power to bring forth water out of this rock for you?

Verse 11



Verse 12

BECAUSE YE BELIEVED NOT IN ME. This alludes to the secret at which I hinted, i.e., that God’s name was not sanctified through them.

Verse 13

AND HE WAS SANCTIFIED IN THEM. Through Moses and Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the term <i>bam</i> (in them) does not refer to the water.</i> Our verse has the same meaning as <i>Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified</i> (Lev. 10:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">God is sanctified when he punishes the righteous.

Verse 16

AND SENT AN ANGEL.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>malakh</i>. The word <i>malakh</i> can be rendered as messenger or angel.

Verse 17

THROUGH FIELD OR THROUGH VINEYARD. So that they do not destroy it. We will not even drink the water of your wells.

Verse 18



Verse 19

WE WILL GO UP BY THE HIGHWAY. What harm will it cause you if we up by the highway? If we need water you will sell it to us. This is the meaning of <i>mikhram</i> (v. 19). It means the price thereof.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

Verse 26

AND STRIP…AND PUT THEM UPON. <i>Ve-hafshet</i> (and strip) and <i>ve-hilbashtam</i> (and put them upon) are <i>hifils</i>.

THAT ISRAEL CAME BY THE WAY OF ATHARIM. Some say that the <i>alef</i> of <i>atharim</i> is superfluous. They say that the meaning of <i>ha-atharim</i> is, those who spy.

Verse 5

THIS LIGHT BREAD. The word <i>ha-kelokel</i> (this light) means the very light.

Verse 6

AND THE LORD…SERPENTS. The word <i>ha-serafim</i> (fiery) is an adjective. The following is a midrashic interpretation. Scripture states, <i>If the serpent bite before it is charmed, Then the charmer hath no advantage</i> (Eccles. 10:11). These people<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Who spoke against God and Moses.</i> sent their tongues to bite.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A metaphor for speaking evil.</i> They were repaid with snakes being sent against them.

VAHEB IN SUPHAH. There were wars in these mentioned places in ancient times. The word Vaheb is not Hebrew. Neither is Vophsi (Num. 13:14), Vashti (Esth. 1:9), Vaizatha (Esth. 9:9), and also Vashni (I Chron. 6:13).

Note that <i>eshed ha-nehalim</i> (the slope of the valleys) and the wilderness which is called Beer and Mattanah and Nahaliel are all names of places.

The following is proof of this. Scripture states that Israel journeyed from the valley<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">That is in the field of Moab (v. 10).</i> to the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho (Num. 22:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. connects Num. 22:1 to Num. 21:10.</i> It also states that Israel journeyed from the mountains of Abarim to the plains of Moab beyond the Jordon at Jericho (Num. 33:48).

The Torah there states, <i>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo</i> to the top of Pisgah (Deut. 34:1). The valley was thus at the top of Pisgah.

Verse 13

THE PRINCES OF BALAK.

FOR I WILL PROMOTE THEE. With money.
AND WHATSOEVER THOU SAYEST UNTO ME I WILL DO. If this is necessary for you to curse them.

Verse 19

HERE.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ba-zeh</i>, literally means in this. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> In this place. The Gaon, of blessed memory,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> says: Should someone argue and say, “How could God tell Balaam rise up, <i>go with them</i> (v. 20) after telling him <i>Thou shalt not go with them</i> (12)?”<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">According to the medieval Jewish philosophers, God does not change His mind.</i> Then we can answer him that God did not want Balaam to go with these messengers but to wait until Balak sent messengers more honorable than they. However, I believe that there is no need for the Gaon’s interpretation. Its meaning is similar to God telling Israel, <i>Send thou men</i> (Num. 13:2) and <i>go up, take possession</i> (Deut. 1:21). Israel did not believe.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">That they could conquer the Canaanites without first spying out the land.</i> On the contrary, they said, <i>Let us send men before us</i> (Deut. 1:22). Moses then asked God.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Whether to send spies or not.</i> God told him, <i>Send thou men</i> (Num. 13:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">God told Balaam not to go to Balak to curse Israel. When Balaam told God that he wanted to go, God told him, go but do not curse Israel. In other words, the prohibition was on the cursing, not on the going.</i> Now after God told Balaam, <i>thou shalt not curse the people</i> (v. 12), what need did Balaam have to say, <i>that I may know what the Lord will speak unto me more</i> (v. 19)? Balaam had an evil thought in his heart. God told him go with the men, but take care that you do not say anything save that which I will tell you. <i>And God’s anger was kindled because he went</i> (v. 22) is proof that my explanation is correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise, God would not have been angry at him for going, after he had received permission to go.</i>

Verse 28

AND THE LORD OPENED THE MOUTH OF THE ASS. The rabbis, of blessed memory, said that ten things were created on Sabbath eve at twilight.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Among them the mouth of Balaam’s ass. See <i>Abot</i> 5:6.</i> I believe that this means that God specifically decreed the creation of these miraculous phenomena,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in <i>Abot</i> 5:6.</i> for they are beyond the laws of nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, these miraculous phenomena, one of which was the mouth of Balaam’s ass, were not actually created on Sabbath eve at twilight. God decreed that they come into being at their proper time. Maimonides makes a similar point in his commentary on <i>Abot</i> 5:6.</i> The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> says that the ass did not speak. Rabbi Samuel the son of Hofni attacked the Gaon.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">For saying this.</i> However, Rabbi Samuel the Spanish poet tried to save the one who was attacked.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Samuel the Spanish tried to defend Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> Note, the rationalists had a need for a non-literal interpretation of our text, for they said that God would not create signs in the world to change the laws which he created.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The rationalists argue that God would not change the laws of nature.</i> He would do so only to justify his prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The rationalists argue that God would only change the laws of nature to prove that what a prophet said was true.

Indeed, this is how Scripture refers to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Balaam…the soothsayer</i> (Josh. 13:22).</i> Some say that Balaam knew the mind of the heavenly beings and was able to channel them by images that he made.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Balaam made images which had the power to manipulate the heavenly powers.</i> This is the meaning of <i>and he whom thou cursest is cursed</i> (v. 6). However, it appears to me that Balaam was an astrologer. When Balaam saw in the star of a given person that an evil time had befallen him, he would curse him. When evil befell the one whom he cursed, then those who witnessed and heard the imprecation thought that the evil came because of Balaam’s curse. The fact that Balaam spoke with guile to the lords of Balak is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">First he told them that he couldn’t curse Israel. Then he hinted that he could.</i> The meaning of <i>I can not go beyond the word of the Lord my God</i> (v. 18) is, it is not in the hand of any created being to change a deed or a decree of God. The secret is, the part<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">A human being.

Verse 35

Verse 37

WHEREFORE CAMEST THOU NOT UNTO ME. The word <i>halakhta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Which literally means you went.</i> is to be rendered camest because it is followed by <i>elai</i> (unto me).

The term <i>devar</i> means “thing of.” <i>Mah</i> literally means what.</i>

FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF THE EAST. The word <i>kedem</i> means east.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>kedem</i> can also mean old.</i>

EXECRATE ISRAEL. Scripture repeats itself <sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And come execrate Israel</i> repeats <i>Come curse me Jacob</i>.</i> as is its custom. Its manner is to employ different words to express the same thought. It repeats itself for emphasis. The word <i>zo’amah</i> (execrate)<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zo’amah</i> is vocalized with a <i>cholam</i>.</i> should have been vocalized like the word <i>zokhrah</i> (remember)<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zokrah</i> is vocalized with a short <i>kamatz</i>.</i> in <i>Remember unto me, O my God</i> (Neh. 5:19).

AND HOW SHALL I EXECRATE, WHOM GOD HATH NOT EXECRATED. The words <i>ezam</i> (shall I execrate) and <i>za’am</i> (execrate) come from the root, <i>zayin, ayin, mem</i> (anger). Scripture repeats itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The second half of our verse repeats the first half.</i>

Verse 9

FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCKS I SEE HIM. Balaam said this because he was high up on the hill. He went not, as at other times, to meet with enchantments. <i>But he set his face toward the wilderness</i> (Num. 24:1)<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumes that the wilderness is a flat area.</i> and not toward the high place<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Which he previously faced.</i> is proof that my interpretation of <i>shefi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 3.</i> is correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture contrasts <i>midbar</i> (wilderness), which is a flat area, with <i>sefi</i>. Thus <i>sefi</i> must refer to an elevated area.</i> It is also likely that <i>from the top of the rocks</i> is a parable symbolizing the decrees that come down from heaven. For Balaam in his wisdom<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Which came to him from on high.</i> saw that this nation would stand alone and not intermingle with other nations that would overpower her and try to force her to give up God’s Torah, as the nations did.
AND SHALL NOT BE RECKONED AMONG THE NATIONS. I will explain this in my comments on <i>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance</i> (Deut. 32:8).

Verse 10

WHO HATH COUNTED. It is a wonder that Israel is not counted with the nations, when they are a nation as numerous as the sand. It is likely for a small nation not to be counted.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Because of its insignificance, but not a large one whose number is like the sand.</i>
THE DUST OF JACOB. Its meaning is: Jacob is as numerous as the dust of the earth.
OR NUMBERED THE STOCK OF ISRAEL? One standard.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets <i>rova</i> (stock) as a quarter. The camp of Israel was divided into four standards (Num 2:1-31). Thus a quarter of Israel was one standard.</i> It means the same as <i>thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all</i> (v. 13).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The idea of our verse is, who can count even part of Israel.</i>
[LET ME DIE THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS, AND LET MINE END BE LIKE HIS!] The Aramaic translator beautifully explained the meaning of <i>yesharim</i> (the righteous).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>yesharim</i> as the honest.</i>I believe that Balaam wanted to die. He wanted his end to be like the end of Israel, who are God’s portion and are not ruled by the stars, for he was a magician.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation Balaam made two requests: to die the death of the righteous and to be granted a share in the world to come.</i> Others say that <i>mine end</i> repeats <i>let me die</i>. Balaam wanted to die like the righteous of Israel, for he knew that he would die by the sword.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation Balaam had one request, to die the death of Israel. The Bible merely repeats itself.</i> The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> says that <i>Who hath counted</i> refers to God. Our verse means: You who are able to count the dust of Jacob, give me the death of the righteous. However, if this is so, then what meaning is there to <i>Or numbered the stock of Israel</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For Balaam would not say to God, <i>You who are able to count a standard of Israel</i> after saying, <i>You who are able to count the dust of Israel</i>.</i> Many explain that <i>rova</i> (the stock of) is similar in meaning to <i>rivi</i>, which means my lying down. Compare, <i>Thou measurest my going about and my lying down</i> (rivi) (Ps. 139:3). They explain that the <i>dust of Jacob</i> refers to the time that Jacob journeys.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">They interpret our verse as follows: Who can count Israel when Israel camps; Who can count Israel when Israel journeys.</i>

Verse 11

[THOU HAST BLESSED THEM ALTOGETHER.] It is normal usage to place the infinitive first in the perfect and then the imperfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">When Scripture wants to emphasize a point, it repeats the verb.

According to Rabbi Judah, the first grammarian, the word <i>kovno</i> comes from the root <i>kof, bet, nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the <i>nun</i> is not a sign of the pronoun. The word <i>kovno</i> is similar to <i>yirdefo</i>; i.e., the pronoun is represented by a <i>cholam</i>.</i> If this is the case, then <i>kovno</i> cannot be an imperative, for we do not find such a vocalization in the <i>kal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">We do not find the imperative combined with the pronoun <i>him</i> signified by a <i>vav</i> (Filwarg).</i> Perhaps <i>kovno</i> is an infinitive vocalized like the word <i>shomro</i> (keep) in <i>and because He would keep the oath</i> (Deut. 7:8).

AND HE TOOK UP HIS PARABLE. The reference is to <i>like the lofty horns of the wild-ox</i> (v. 22) and <i>a people that riseth up as a lioness</i> (v. 24).
GIVE EAR UNTO ME. The word <i>adai</i> (unto me) is related to the word <i>ad</i> (unto). The word <i>adai</i> (unto Me) in <i>Yet have ye not returned unto Me</i> (Amos 4:6) is similar. Scripture repeats itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The second part of the last clause repeats its first part.</i> The <i>vav</i> in <i>beno tzippor</i> (son of Zippor) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Here <i>beno</i> means son of, not his son.</i> It is similar to the <i>vav</i> of <i>le-mayeno</i> (a fountain) in <i>into a fountain of waters</i> (Ps. 114:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-mayeno</i> in this verse means a fountain of, not a fountain.</i>
[GOD IS NOT A MAN.] Balaam said this in response to Balak’s request, <i>and curse me them from thence</i> (v. 13).

See Num. 25:1-3.</i> Scripture’s meaning is that God is not like a man that he should repent (v. 19), for He did not see iniquity in Israel. However, if there be iniquity in Israel, then God’s word will not come to pass, for all of God’s words are conditional unless accompanied by an oath. Compare, <i>At one instant I may speak concerning a nation…to build and to plant…but if it do evil in My sight…then I repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit it</i>. (Jer. 18:7-10).

LIKE THE LOFTY HORNS OF THE WILD-OX. <i>Ke-to’afot re’em</i> (like the lofty horns of the wild-ox) is similar to <i>karne re’em</i> (the horns of the wild-ox) (Deut. 33:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>re’em</i> refers to an animal.</i> The meaning of <i>to’afot is</i>, the might of.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The horns represent the might of the animal.</i> <i>To’afot</i> (the heights of) in <i>The heights of the mountain are His also</i> (Ps. 95:4) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., Ps. 95:4 should be rendered: the might of the mountain are also His.</i> It is also possible that the meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of.</i> of <i>ve-to’afot harim lo</i> (the heights of the mountains are His) is, the horns of the mountains are also His.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Horns representing might. There is no difference in meaning between the two interpretations. They only differ with regard to the literal meaning of <i>to’afot</i>.</i> The meaning of <i>ve-kehsef to’afot lakh</i> (and precious silver unto thee) (Job 22:25) is, and silver, as mighty as the mountains.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Job 22:25. <i>To’afot</i> is short for <i>to’afot harim</i> (might of the mountains).</i> Scripture reads <i>lo</i> (to him). [It means to them.] Compare, <i>and the shouting for the King is among them</i> (v. 21). It means that this God made Israel strong. God did all this for them because Israel cleaves to God and does not seek anything from anyone but the Lord, for they have no need for an enchanter and a diviner.

Verse 23

NOW IT IS SAID OF JACOB. <i>Ka-et</i> (now) is to be rendered, like this time.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>ka-et</i> is, like a time. I.E. explains that this means like this time.</i> Its meaning is: at all times it will be told to them without the assistance of an enchanter.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">What God will do.</i>
WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT. <i>Mah pa’al el</i> (what hath God wrought) is to be rendered, what God shall do. All things decreed, even those decreed for the future, are decreed in the past. Hence Scripture employs a perfect (<i>pa’al)</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">For what God will do.</i> This will be told to Israel prophetically. What is told in prophecy is the truth.
OF JACOB AND OF ISRAEL. Scripture repeats itself in a prophetic utterance. Compare, <i>From the top of Senir and Hermon</i> (Song of Songs 4:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Senir and Hermon refer to the same mountain. See Deut. 3:9.</i>

Verse 24

BEHOLD A PEOPLE THAT RISETH UP AS A LIONESS. This hints that Israel will conquer the kings of Canaan. It seems most logical to interpret it this way regarding a soon-to-occur event,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">That it relates to a war that occurred prior to the conquest of Canaan.</i> such as the war against Midian.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 31:1-12.</i> A war like it was unprecedented. No Israelites were lost in this war<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 31:49.</i> and five kings died in it,<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 31:8.</i> along with thirty-two thousand females who never slept with a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 31:35.</i>
AND DRINK THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN. The spoil and all their wealth.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">The wealth of the slain. See Num. 31:11.</i> According to the midrashic interpretation it means that Moses would not die until he ate of the prey.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Moses wouldn’t die until he first defeated and looted the Midianites.</i> Scripture similarly reads: <i>Afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people</i> (Num. 31:2).

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

THAT THOU MAYEST CURSE ME THEM. <i>Ve-kabbota</i> (that thou mayest curse) comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>kof, bet, bet</i>.</i> Compare, <i>ve-sabboti ani</i> (therefore I turned) (Eccles. 2:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sabboti</i> comes from the root <i>samekh, bet, bet</i>.</i>

Verse 28

UNTO THE TOP OF PEOR. Balaam did not seek to use sorcery, so God’s spirit came upon him. Balaam acted like this because he saw <i>that there is no enchantment with Jacob</i> (Num. 23:23).

Chapter 24



Verse 1

BUT HE SET HIS FACE TOWARD THE WILDERNESS. Where Israel was, in the plains of Moab.

Verse 2

DWELLING TRIBE BY TRIBE. He saw all the standards.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He saw Israel camped around their standards.</i> Some say that Balaam had a diabolical eye. Such people are called evildoers. Balaam did evil by employing his diabolic eye. I have already made my opinion known to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 22:28.</i>

Verse 3

AND HE TOOK UP HIS PARABLE.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>va-yissa meshalo va-yomar</i>, literally, and he lifted up his parable and said. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> This means he lifted up his voice and uttered his parable. The parable was, <i>As valleys stretched out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The parable ends with verse 9. What comes before is a description, not a parable.</i> (v. 6).
THE SAYING OF. The word <i>ne’um</i> means the saying of. Compare, <i>va-yimamu ne’um</i> (and say: He saith) (Jer. 23:31). Some say that <i>who heareth</i> and also <i>Who seeth</i> means who hears and who sees by divination. However, it most likely refers to that which is heard and seen in a prophetic dream. Compare Eliphaz’s statement, <i>A form was before mine eyes; I heard a still voice</i> (Job 4:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Eliphaz was describing a vision he had when asleep.</i>
WHOSE EYE IS OPENED. The word <i>shetum</i> (opened) has no brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It does not occur elsewhere in Scripture.</i> It can be interpreted only in context. <i>Shetum</i> is the opposite of <i>setum</i> (shut).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>shetum ha-ayin</i> means whose eye is opened.</i> Some say that Balaam had only one eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi.</i> However, this is a midrashic interpretation.

Verse 4

FALLEN DOWN. Compare, <i>a deep sleep fell upon Abram</i> (Gen. 15:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>fallen down</i> means fallen down in sleep.</i>
YET WITH OPENED EYES. Even though he sleeps, he sees with his eyes. Compare, [<i>I sleep</i>] <i>but my heart waketh</i> (Cant. 5:2).

Verse 5

HOW GOODLY. <i>Tovu</i> (goodly) is a verb in the perfect. It is similar to <i>oru</i> (are brightened) in <i>how mine eyes have brightened</i> (I Sam. 14:29).

Verse 6

STRETCHED OUT. The <i>tet</i> of <i>nittayu</i> (stretched out) rceives a <i>dagesh</i> to compensate for the <i>nun</i> of <i>natah</i> (stretched),<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>nittayu</i> comes from the root <i>nun, tet, heh</i>.</i> which is swallowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nittayu</i> is a <i>nifal</i>. Its <i>nun</i> is the <i>nun</i> of the <i>nifal</i> form, not the <i>nun</i> of the root. If the <i>nun</i> of the root were present, the word would read <i>nintayu</i>.</i> Scripture reads <i>stretched out</i> because there are rivers that turn here and there and have trees over them.
AS ALOES. <i>Ahalim</i> (aloes) is similar to the word <i>ahalot</i> (aloes) in <i>myrrh, and aloes</i> (Ps. 45:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Even though <i>ahalim</i> (aloes) is in the masculine and <i>ahalot</i> (aloes) in the feminine.</i> Note, Balaam compares the tents<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Of Israel.</i> to stretched-out rivers.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Next to which cedar and aloe trees are planted.</i>
AS CEDARS. Scripture repeats itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cedars are parallel to aloes.</i> Balaam mentions cedars in the sense of <i>He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon</i> (Ps. 92:13).

Verse 7

WATER SHALL FLOW. Look, <i>mayim</i> is in the singular.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even though <i>mayim</i> is a plural form. The word <i>yizzal</i> (shall flow), which modifies <i>mayim</i> (water), is in the singular. Hence I.E. comment.</i> Compare, <i>the water of</i> (mai) <i>sprinkling was not dashed</i> (zorak)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zorak</i>, which modifies <i>mayim</i>, is in the singular. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 31).</i> <i>against him</i> (Num. 19:13).
FROM HIS BRANCHES. <i>Dalyo</i> (his branches) is similar to <i>daliyyotav</i> (his branches) (Jer. 11:16).
AND HIS SEED SHALL BE IN MANY WATERS. Like seed saturated with water. This means he shall flourish and grow every day.
AND HIS KING SHALL BE HIGHER THAN AGAG. This is a prophecy regarding Saul, Israel’s first king, for prior to Saul there were judges but no kings.

Verse 8

GOD WHO BROUGHT HIM FORTH. The meaning of our verse is: the God who brought him [Israel] out of Egypt made him as powerful as the lofty horns of the wild-ox. Let not the one who would dispute this claim that the word him<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the word <i>lo</i> (him) in the clause <i>Is for him like the lofty horns of the wild-ox</i>.</i> refers to God, because Scripture earlier used the plural form <i>motzi’am</i> (brought them forth) when it stated, <i>God who brought them forth</i> (Num. 23:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 23:22 literally reads: God who brought them forth out of Egypt, for Him (<i>lo</i>) like the lofty horns of the wild-ox. Our verse reads: God who brought him out of Egypt, for him (<i>lo</i>) like the lofty horns of the wild-ox. Now, just as the word <i>lo</i> (him) in the first verse applies to God, so must the word <i>lo</i> (him) in the second verse apply to God.</i> For such is the style of Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">To refer to the nation of Israel both in the singular and in the plural in one verse. Thus the word <i>lo</i> in Num. 23:22 applies to Israel and similarly in our verse.</i> Compare, <i>And they</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> <i>sit at Thy feet; he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Israel; translated literally.</i> <i>receives</i> (yissa) <i>Thy words</i> (Deut. 33:3); and <i>How long will this</i> (ha-zeh)<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zeh</i> (this) is in the singular.</i> <i>people despise Me</i> (yena’atzuni)<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yena’atzuni</i> (will despise me).</i> (Num. 14:11). There are many such instances.
HE SHALL EAT UP THE NATIONS THAT ARE HIS ADVERSARIES. The reference is to the kings of Canaan.
AND SHALL BREAK THEIR BONES IN PIECES. <i>Garem</i> means a bone. <i>Yigarem</i> means he shall break their bones.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Garem</i> means a bone. The verb formed from this root means to break a bone.</i> The word <i>itzemo</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A verb related to the noun <i>etzem</i> (bone).</i> (hath broken his bones) (Jer. 50:17) is similar. So too is the word <i>mesa’ef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A verb related to the word <i>se’if</i> (bough).</i> (shall lop) in <i>Shall lop the boughs with terror</i> (Is. 10:33) and <i>tefa’er</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">A verb related to the noun <i>pe’er</i> (bough).</i> (go over the boughs) in <i>thou shalt not go over the boughs</i> (Deut. 24 :20).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">All of these verbs mean to destroy whatever their noun roots refer to.</i>
AND PIERCE THEM THROUGH WITH HIS ARROWS. Each one of his arrows shall pierce.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. when a verb in the singular governs a noun in the plural, the verb refers to each one within the plural (see Vol. 1, p. XVII). In our verse the word <i>chitzav</i> (arrows) is in the plural, and <i>yimchatz</i> (pierce), the verb which governs it, is in the singular. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> So too, <i>But the righteous are secure as a young lion</i> (Prov. 28:1);<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">It means that each one of the righteous is secure as a young lion, for <i>tzadikim</i> (the righteous) is in the plural while <i>yivtach</i> (is secure) is in the singular.</i> <i>Its branches run over the wall</i> (Gen. 49:22); <i>Blessed be every one that blesseth thee</i> (v. 9).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Barukh</i> (blessed be) is in the singular; <i>me-varekhekha</i> (they that bless thee) is in the plural. Similarly, <i>korerekha</i> is in the plural, and <i>arur</i> is in the singular.</i> The latter means, everyone that blesses you wil be blessed. So too, <i>and cursed be everyone that curseth thee</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.).

Verse 9

HE COUCHED. The meaning of our verse is: Israel will inherit Canaan, after which the land will be quiet.
SHALL ROUSE HIM UP. I have already explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">“After a lion tears its prey it sits on its knees and crouches in security and no other passing animal will cause it to get up and flee” (I.E. on Gen. 49:8, Vol. 1, p. 429).</i>

Verse 10

AND HE SMOTE HIS HANDS TOGETHER. <i>Va-yispok</i> (and he smote) is similar to <i>safeku</i> (clap) in <i>All that pass by clap Their hands at thee</i> (Lam. 2:15).

Verse 13



Verse 14

AND I WILL ANNOUNCE<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>iyatzekha</i>, literally, I will advise thee.</i> TO THEE. Some say that its meaning is: I will advise you with regard to the daughters of Moab. However, this is far-fetched, for Scripture says, <i>in the end of days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">So it cannot refer to an event that was to happen soon.</i> I believe that we should take it according to its plain meaning; namely, I will advise you, so that you know what you should do, for this people will do this to your people.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In the end of days.</i>

Verse 15



Verse 16

AND KNOWETH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOST HIGH. By prophecy, not through enchantment.

Verse 17

I SEE HIM, BUT NOT NOW. It appears to me that this prophecy refers to King David. Balaam said but not now, for it referred to an event four hundred years later.
I BEHOLD HIM, BUT NOT NIGH. Scripture repeats itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>I behold him, but not nigh</i> repeats, <i>I see him, but not now</i>.</i> The star and the sceptre are the parable.
THERE SHALL STEP FORTH A STAR. There are images of stars that step forth in the sky that never existed and were never known.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">New stars appear that were never known. I.E. is probably referring to comets. His point is that the king referred to in our verse shall suddenly appear.</i>
AND A SCEPTRE<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>shevet</i> (a rod). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> SHALL ARISE. The reference is to a royal sceptre.I believe that <i>shall step</i> means that the star shall be seen making its way, as in <i>The stars in their courses</i> (Jud. 5:20). Many explained that the reference is to the messiah. The ancients said that Sanherib<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">An Assyrian king who lived in the eighth century.</i> mixed up the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yoma</i> 54a.</i> However, note that Scripture speaks of Moab, Amalek, and Asshur.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Thus our verse deals with the pre-Sanherib period. Therefore it cannot pertain to the messiah.</i> Furthermore, why does Balaam conclude with <i>and shall afflict Eber</i> (v. 24)?<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Eber refers to the Israelites. If Balaam’s prophecy refers to the messiah, why does he conclude with the affliction of Israel? Israel will not be afflicted in the messianic era.</i> On the contrary, Balaam should have ended his parable with <i>There shall step forth a star out of Jacob</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For that is what will take place in the messianic era after Israel is afflicted.</i> Those who lack intelligence think that anyone who explains that <i>There shall step forth a star</i> refers to King David denies the coming of the messiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For “those who lack intelligence” believe that this verse is necessary for belief in the coming of the messiah. Therefore one who interprets this verse as referring to King David denies the coming of the messiah.</i> Far be it, far be it, for the messiah is clearly stated in the prophecy of Daniel. I have already explained that Daniel first mentions the coming into existence of the Greek kings<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The kingdoms of the Greeks.</i> and the arising of the Hasmoneans. He mentions the existence of the second temple, the years of the siege, the exile, and the salvation. He notes these things in order. There is no conceivable need for another prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">We would know about the coming of the messiah even if we did not have the Book of Daniel.</i> since we have the words of Moses, who is the most important prophet: <i>If any of thine that are dispersed be in the uttermost parts of heaven… the Lord thy God will bring thee</i> (Deut. 30:4,5).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Back to the Land of Israel. In other words, although our verse does not allude to the messiah, Deuteronomy does. I.E. notes this because he wants to show that Moses predicted the coming of the messiah.</i>
AND SHALL SMITE THROUGH THE CORNERS OF MOAB. This is what David did.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See II Sam. 8:2.</i>
AND BREAK DOWN. The word <i>karkar</i> (break down) is similar to <i>mekarkar kir</i> (Is. 22:5), the meaning of which is, breaking the wall. It is similar to the word <i>mesa’ef</i> (shall lop) (Is. 10:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In that the verbal form of the noun means to destroy what the noun stands for. See I.E. on verse 8 and the notes thereto.</i>
THE SONS OF SETH. People. Seth was the most important son of Adam, for Noah was descended from him. Yitzchaki<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 36:31 and the notes thereto.</i> says that the reference is to the Amonites and the Moabites, and that Scripture repeats itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Sons of Seth is another term for the Moabites.</i> He also says that the word Seth is derived from the word <i>shet</i> (buttocks) in <i>and with buttocks uncovered</i> (Is. 20:4) and that it alludes to the daughters<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The ancestresses of the Moabites and the Ammonites. See Gen. 19:37,38.</i> of Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Their father, whose nakedness his daughters uncovered. See Gen. 19:30-38.</i> However, this appears to me to be farfetched, for <i>shet</i> refers to the backside,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">While Lot’s daughters uncovered his front. The point is, Scripture would not allude to intercourse by employing the phrase “uncovering the buttocks.”</i> which is the foundation of the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the basic meaning of <i>shet</i> is foundation, not buttock.</i> Compare, <i>ki ha-shatot yeharesun</i> (When the foundations are destroyed) (Ps. 11:3). Many others have explained that the word <i>shet</i> (Seth) in <i>all the sons of Seth</i>, is related to the word <i>ha-shatot</i> (foundations) in <i>When the foundations are destroyed</i>. It means that the cities will be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation, <i>ve-karkar kol bene shet</i> (and break down all the sons of Seth) means: and will break down all foundations.</i> This interpretation is not far-fetched.

Verse 18

AND EDOM SHALL BE A POSSESSION. The word <i>yereshah</i> (possession) is related to the word <i>torishu</i> (drive out)<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>torishu</i> destroy. See I.E. on Ex. 15:9.</i> in <i>But if ye will not drive out</i> (Num. 33:55).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>ve-hayah edom yereshah</i> (And Edom shall be a possession) as, and Edom shall be destroyed.</i> <i>Yereshah</i> is a noun vocalized according to the pattern of the word <i>levenah</i> (tile) in <i>take thee a tile</i> (Ezek. 4:1). It is in place of an adjective. Compare the word <i>shemamah</i> (desolation) in <i>and it shall be a desolation</i> (Is. 17:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Here too Scripture employs a noun (<i>shemamah</i>) in place of an adjective (<i>shomemah</i>).</i> We know that David’s hand overpowered Edom<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See II Sam. 8:14.</i> and Mount Seir.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Edom’s abode.</i>

Verse 19

AND OUT OF JACOB SHALL ONE HAVE DOMINION.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-yerd mi-ya’akov</i>, literally, and a ruler from Jacob. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> A ruler shall arise out of Jacob.
AND SHALL DESTROY THE REMNANT FROM THE CITY. From every city.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">From city (<i>me-ir</i>) is short for from every city.</i> Its meaning is, from Edom. The reference is to Joab, for Scripture clearly states, <i>and had smitten every male in Edom</i> (I Kings 11:15).

Verse 20

AND HE LOOKED ON AMALEK. Via prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">He did not actually look at Amalek.</i> <i>The first of the nations</i> is the parable. It means Amalek was the first nation to wage war against Israel, but his end shall be utter destruction. This<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The destruction of Amalek.</i> took place in the days of Saul, who slew <i>man and woman, infant and suckling</i> (I Sam. 15:3) and old men. Many explain that the meaning of <i>the first of the nations</i> is that Amalek was considered to be the head of the nations. However, this was not the case.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Amalek was never the chief of the nations.</i>

Verse 21

AND HE LOOKED ON THE KENITE.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The father-in-law of Moses.</i> The family of Jethro. Scripture writes, <i>These are the Kenites</i> (I Chron. 2:55) and <i>Now Heber the Kenite</i> (Jud. 4:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses</i>. This shows that the Kenites are descended from Moses’ father-in-law.</i> <i>And though thy nest be set in the rock</i> is the parable.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned earlier in the verse.</i> The latter repeats the preceding clause.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And though thy nest be set in the rock</i> repeats <i>Though firm be thy dwelling place</i>.</i> Its meaning is, though your dwelling place be as high as the nest of a bird, it will not save you.

Verse 22

KAIN SHALL BE WASTED. <i>Le-va’er</i> (wasted) is similar to the word <i>le-va’er</i> (eaten up) in <i>it shall again be eaten up</i> (Is. 6:13); and <i>yeva’er</i> (sweepeth) in <i>as a man sweepeth away dung</i> (I Kings 14:10); and <i>u-vi’arta</i> (so shalt thou put away) in <i>So shalt thou put away the evil from thee</i> (Deut. 13:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>le-va’er</i> means to destroy.</i> Kain and the Kenite are one and the same.
[HOW LONG? ASSHUR SHALL CARRY THEE AWAY CAPTIVE.] Balaam, as it were, said: How long shall Asshur carry thee<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The Kenites.</i> away captive? He will not let go of you until you are wasted. Asshur is feminine. Asshur is short for the camp of Asshur. Compare, <i>va-tipple sheva va-tikkachem</i> (and the Sabeans made a raid) (Job 1:15); <i>Va-ta’arokh yisra’el</i> (and Israel…put the battle in array) (I Sam. 17:21).

Verse 23

AND HE TOOK UP HIS PARABLE, AND SAID. The reference is to <i>But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim</i> (v. 24). When Balaam mentioned that the Kenite would be carried away captive, he also said that a time would come when Asshur would be afflicted and Eber along with him. The latter refers to the Hebrews that Asshur carried away captive, for the Kenites lived with the Israelites. The interpretation of the Aramaic translation is well known.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>ever</i> (Eber) by <i>ever perat</i> (the other side of the Euphrates).</i> However, it is not the practice of Scripture to mention the word <i>ever</i> without the word <i>nahar</i> (river) following it.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">When referring to the other side of the Euphrates.</i> Some explain that <i>tzim</i> (ships) is a plural. It is related to the word <i>tzi</i> (ship) in gallant ship (Is. 33:21). Others say that the word <i>tzim</i> is related to the word <i>tziyim</i> (wild-cats) <i>in And the wild-cats shall meet with the jackals</i> (Is. 34:14). Balaam compared the Kittim to wild-cats because people will be gripped by fear when they appear.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">These commentators explain our verse as follows: wild-cats shall come from the land of Kittim.</i>
[ALAS, WHO SHALL LIVE AFTER GOD HATH APPOINTED HIM.] The reference is to the king of Asshur who made himself into a god. The latter is noted in the Book of Isaiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">See Is. 10:7. Isaiah did not actually say this. He intimated that the king of Assyria, in destroying nations, acted like a god.</i> Or its meaning is: Who shall survive the decrees which God placed in the world via Asshur, for the king of Assyria conquered all the nations. The latter is clearly stated in Scripture.

Verse 24

OF KITTIM. They are descended from Javin, for the latter is clearly stated in Scripture (Gen. 10:4). It is also possible that Scripture alludes to the kingdom of the Greeks. I have already explained in the Book of Daniel, that the kingdom of the Greeks and that of the Kittim are one and the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Dan. 2:39. Some texts read <i>aram</i> instead of <i>kittim</i>. <i>Aram</i> stands for the Romans. See I.E. on Dan. 2:39.</i> There is clear proof that it is the third beast.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See Dan. 7:6.</i>
FROM THE COAST OF KITTIM. <i>Mi-yad</i> (from the coast of) means from the place. Compare the word <i>yad</i> in <i>the side</i> (yad) <i>of the Jordan</i> (Num. 13:29) and <i>Thou shalt have a place</i> (Deut. 23:13).
AND ALSO HE. The Kittim. Kittim is singular even though it comes in the plural form. <i>And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim</i> (Gen. 10:4) is proof of this.

Verse 25

AND BALAAM ROSE UP. For he was lying down. A deep sleep had fallen over him. Scripture clearly states, <i>Fallen down, yet with opened eyes</i> (v. 16).

Chapter 25



Verse 1

IN SHITTIM. For Scripture clearly states, <i>And they pitched by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim</i> (Num. 33:49).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Israel was in Shittim during the incident of Balaam. They did not journey there after the incident.</i> Everything took place in the plains of Moab, for Israel did not move from there.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Until Israel crossed the Jordan and entered Canaan.</i> Also, Joshua sent spies from there (Josh. 2:1).
[AND THE PEOPLE BEGAN.] I believe that <i>va-yachel</i> (began) is a <i>hifil</i>.

Verse 2

AND BOWED DOWN. Israel and the daughters of Moab.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads: <i>And the people did eat</i> (va-yokhal), <i>and bowed down</i> (va-yishtachavu). <i>Va-yokhal</i> is in the singular. <i>Va-yishtachavu</i> is in the plural. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 3

AND ISRAEL JOINED HIMSELF. The word <i>va-yitzamed</i> is related to the word <i>tzemed</i> (yoke) in <i>a yoke of oxen</i> (I Sam. 11:7). The reference is to the Moabite women; that is, Israel was joined with the women in the religion of <i>pe’or</i>.

Verse 4

AND HANG THEM. The reference is to those who were joined.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Not to the chiefs of the people. The text is vague. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The proof text is, <i>And Moses said unto the judges of Israel</i> (v. 5).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. identifies the chiefs with the judges.</i>
AND HANG THEM. <i>Ve-hoka otam</i> (and hang them) is similar to <i>va-yaki’um</i> (and they hanged them) in <i>and they hanged them in the mountain</i> (II Sam. 21:9). It is to be understood in accordance with the words of the Aramaic translation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>u-ketol de-chayyav ketol</i>: execute those who are guilty of a capital crime. However, I.E.’s reference might be to Targum Jonathan, who renders <i>ve-hiki’um, u-tzelovinun</i> as, and hang them (Krinsky). However, it should also be noted that <i>u-tzelovinun</i> can also be rendered, and crucify them.</i> The proof text is, <i>In the face of the sun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">That the reference is to public execution. For they were hung in the mountain so that all in the vicinity could see them executed.</i> The meaning of <i>in the face of the sun</i> is, in public. Compare, <i>in the sight of this sun</i> (II Sam. 12:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The entire clause reads, <i>and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun</i>. The next verse continues, <i>but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun</i>.</i>

Verse 5

SLAY YE EVERY ONE HIS MEN. From whatever tribe they may be. It is known that they slew,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Those who worshipped <i>pe’or</i>.</i> even though Scripture does not mention this.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">That the judges slew those who worshipped <i>pe’or</i>.</i>

Verse 6

AND BROUGHT UNTO HIS BRETHREN. He gave her to his family.
WHILE THEY WERE WEEPING. Praying to God.

Verse 7

AND WHEN PHINEHAS…SAW. When Phinehas saw this, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, which was in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. There is a question here.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Why did Phinehas kill Zimri? Scripture does not tell us that Zimri worshipped <i>pe’or</i> (Weiser).</i> It is possible to answer that Zimri (v. 14) was joined<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">With Cozbi in the worship of <i>pe’or</i>.</i> in the presence of witnesses.

Verse 8

INTO THE CHAMBER. <i>El ha-kubbah</i> (into the chamber) means into the tent. The word has a similar meaning in Arabic, although there is a difference in shape between an <i>ohel</i> (tent) and a <i>kubbah</i> (chamber).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Between what the Hebrews refer to as an <i>ohel</i> and the Arabic <i>kubbah</i>.</i>
AND THRUST. <i>Va-yidkor</i> (and thrust) is similar to <i>ve-dokreni</i> (thrust me) in <i>and thrust me through therewith</i> (I Sam. 31:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>va-yidkor</i> means and he thrust.</i>
THROUGH HER BELLY. <i>El kovatah</i> (through her belly) means in the chamber, that is, in the chamber where she was with Zimri’s brothers. Others say that the word that <i>kovatah</i> is related to is the word <i>kevah</i> (maw) in <i>the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw</i> (Deut. 18:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>kovatah</i> means her belly.</i> There is also a midrashic statement to the effect that ten miracles were performed for Phinehas.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sifre</i> and <i>Tanchuma</i> on our Torah portion list 12 miracles.</i> However, Scripture does not mention them.

Verse 11

IN THAT HE WAS VERY JEALOUS FOR MY SAKE AMONG THEM. There is no <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>nun</i> of <i>be-kano</i> (in that he was very jealous) in order to simplify enunciation.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kano</i> is in the <i>pi’el</i>. The middle root letters in the <i>pi’el</i> receive a <i>dagesh</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It means that Phinehas was jealous like his creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads: He acted jealously in My place.</i> Scripture tells us that God is <i>a jealous God</i> (Ex. 20:5) when it comes to idolatry.
[SO THAT I CONSUMED NOT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL IN MY JEALOUSY.] If Phinehas had not been jealous for My sake, then I would have destroyed all of Israel in My jealousy.

Verse 12

MY COVENANT OF PEACE. The meaning of <i>beriti shalom</i> (My covenant of peace) is:<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>beriti shalom</i> is: My covenant peace. “Of” is not in the Hebrew text. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> My covenant, a covenant of peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>beriti shalom</i> should be read as if written <i>beriti, berit shalom</i>.</i> Compare, <i>Thy throne God</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Ps. 45:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Which should be read as if written, Thy throne, throne of God. See I.E. on Num. 12:6.</i> There are many such cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Where a word is missing in the Biblical text and has to be supplied by the reader.</i> Its meaning is that Phinehas should not fear the brothers of Zimri for Zimri<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Who came from a powerful family which might avenge his death.</i> was a prince of a father’s house (v. 14). Phinehas was rewarded with the covenant of priesthood for himself and his seed forever, for all the high priests were descendants of Phinehas. It is possible that Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Who served as high priest after the passing of Aaron. See Num. 20:22-29.</i> had other sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The high priesthood would in any case have been passed on through Phinehas.</i>

Verse 13

The word <i>acharav</i> (after him) (v. 13)<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “after him” means after his death.</i> is proof that Phinehas died and is in no way to be identified with Elijah.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Who did not die. Some of the rabbis believe that Phinehas is Elijah. See <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> on the Torah portion, <i>Phinehas</i>.</i> I have already explained it.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Jud. 20:28.</i> Phinehas <i>was ruler over them</i> [Israel] (I Chron. 9:20). He was alive during the incident of the concubine from Gibeah.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Judges, chapters 19-21. These citations, which occurred before the story of Elijah, prove that Phinehas could not be Elijah.</i>
BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS FOR HIS GOD. He acted out of his love for God. He also did good for Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>and made atonement for the children of Israel</i>.</i> According to the midrashic interpretation, the father<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Phinehas.</i> atoned and the children<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Phinehas’s descendants.</i> will atone.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the connection between <i>an everlasting priesthood</i> and <i>because he…made atonement for the children of Israel</i>.</i>

WHO WAS SLAIN WITH THE MIDIANITISH WOMAN. <i>Et ha-midyanit</i> is to be rendered, with the Midianitish woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>et</i> here means with.</i> There are many such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Where <i>et</i> has the meaning of with.

HARASS. <i>Tzaror</i> (harass) is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>.

Verse 3

AND HE WAS NOT AMONG THE COMPANY. The daughters<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Of Zelophehad.</i> thought that the children of those who gathered themselves together against the Lord<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the company of Korah (Num. 16:1-19).</i> would not inherit.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they said that their father was not in Korah’s company.</i>
BUT HE DIED IN HIS OWN SIN. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi the Spaniard says <i>but he died in his own sin</i> is to be understood as connected to <i>and he had no sons</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning here is: he died without sons because of his sins.</i> It is as we say today, such and such occurred to so and so because of his sins. This interpretation is not far off.

Verse 4

BECAUSE HE HAD NO SON. <i>Ki en lo ben</i> is to be rendered, because he had no son.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>ki</i> in our verse is because. <i>Ki</i> has a number of meanings. Hence I.E.’s comments.</i>

AND THOU SHALT CAUSE THE INHERITANCE. What he should have received, they shall receive.

Verse 8

AND HAVE NO SON. This is proof that a son inherits his father’s property.

Verse 11

UNTO HIS KINSMAN THAT IS NEXT TO HIM. From all of his family.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That is closest to the deceased.</i>
AND HE SHALL POSSESS IT. The inheritance. I have already explained the approach of the rabbis in my comments on <i>unto a foreign people</i> (Ex. 21:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>ve-yarash otah</i>. The rabbis render this, and he (the husband) shall inherit her (<i>otah</i>). According to the rabbis our verse teaches that a man inherits his wife’s property but a woman does not inherit her husband’s property. See <i>Baba Batra</i> 111b and I.E.’s short commentary on Ex. 21:8.</i> We need rabbinic tradition to know the laws of inheritance with regard to whether a father or a mother inherits a son’s property or what a woman inherits.

Verse 12

The rabbis of blessed memory said that the chapter that opens with the words, <i>Get thee up into this mountain</i> (v. 12), follows the laws of inheritance because Moses wanted to know who would inherit his position.

Verse 14

TO SANCTIFY ME. The word <i>le-hakdesheni</i> (to sanctify me) is connected to <i>meritem</i> (ye rebelled).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Even though these words do not follow each other.</i> Its meaning is, ye rebelled with regard to sanctifying me.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is, you rebelled against me by not sanctifying me.</i> This, I have explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 20:8.</i> is the meaning of <i>because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel</i> (Deut. 32:51).

[SET.] The word <i>yifkod</i> (set) is related to the word <i>pakid</i> (official).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>yifkod</i> means let Him appoint a leader.</i>

Verse 17

WHO MAY GO OUT BEFORE THEM. In war.
WHO MAY LEAD THEM OUT. <i>Va-asher yotzi’em</i> (who may lead them out) means who will direct someone else to lead them out.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads <i>va-asher yotzi’em.

Verse 18

IN WHOM IS SPIRIT. Now all living persons have spirit in them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Why then does Scripture say, <i>a man in whom is spirit</i>?</i> Its meaning can only be similar to that of <i>be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man</i> (I Kings 2:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Solomon was a man.

Verse 19



Verse 20

AND THOU SHALT PUT OF THY HONOR UPON HIM. You will honor Joshua in front of all of Israel.
THAT…MAY HEARKEN. For Israel already believes in you. When they see that you honored Joshua they will respect him, for they will follow your ways.

Verse 21

AT HIS WORD SHALL THEY GO OUT. Upon the word of Eleazar by the judgment of the Urim.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In others words, <i>al piv</i> (at his word) refers to Eleazar’s word.</i> Others say, in accordance to the judgment of the Urim.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation, <i>al piv</i> (at his word) refers to the Urim.

BOTH HE, AND ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. In regard to that which pertains to all.
EVEN ALL THE CONGREGATION. They gathered in the tent of meeting concerning a matter that pertained to the congregation.

Chapter 28



Verse 1

The reason the chapter dealing with the sacrifices follows<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The chapter dealing with the appointment of Joshua to succeed Moses.</i> is that God then<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Following the appointment of Joshua.</i> ordered Moses to command the children of Israel regarding the sacrifices they are obligated to offer,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In the Land of Israel.</i> for Moses was not to enter the land with them. Scripture starts with the daily burnt offering even though it was mentioned earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In Ex. 29:42. The point is, why repeat the law of the burnt offering.</i> It is possible that the earlier burnt offering was the one offered at Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">When Israel camped around Mount Sinai. In other words, it does not pertain to the daily burnt offering to be made when they entered the Land of Israel.</i> On the other hand, it is possible that Scripture wants to insure that the arrangement of the sacrifices is in order.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture repeats the law of the burnt offering here because it wants to list in order all of the burnt offerings which the congregation is obligated to bring, i.e., the daily burnt offering, the new moon burnt offering, the Passover offering, etc.</i>

Verse 2

MY FOOD. I have previously explained the meaning of the term <i>lechem</i> (food).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In his comments on Ex. 16:4, I.E. explains that the term <i>lechem</i> can refer to bread, meat, or fruit. See I.E. on Ex. 16:4 (Vol. 2, p. 316).</i>
MADE BY FIRE. I have previously explained the meaning of <i>le-ishai</i> (made by fire).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the word <i>isheh</i> means a burnt offering. Thus <i>le-ishai</i> means for my burnt offerings.</i> The meaning of <i>lachmi le-ishai re’ach nicho’ach</i> (My food…made by fire, of a sweet savour unto Me) is, food for my fire, for a sweet savour unto Me.

Verse 4

THE ONE LAMB. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard says that our verse is abridged. It should be read as if written <i>ha-keves, keves echad</i> (the lamb, one lamb).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>et ha-keves echad</i> (the one lamb). A word with the direct object prefixed to it cannot be in the construct. Our verse reads, the lamb one in the morning. This is incorrect syntax.

Verse 10

OF EVERY SABBATH. The <i>vav</i> suffixed to the word <i>shabbat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the <i>vav</i> in the word <i>shabbato</i> (every Sabbath).</i> refers to the day of Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> is feminine. Thus Scripture should have used the term <i>shabbatah</i> if the reference was to every Sabbath. Hence I.E.’s comment that the <i>vav</i> refers to the word <i>yom</i> in verse 9, which is masculine. Thus according to I.E. we should render <i>shabbato</i> (every Sabbath) as every Sabbath day.</i> This is so even though we find the word <i>me-challelo</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>mechallelah</i>.</i> (from profaning it<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Sabbath. We thus see that Scripture treats <i>shabbat</i> as masculine.</i>) in <i>Every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it</i> (Is. 56:6). The meaning of <i>be-shabbato</i> (of every Sabbath) is, <i>every sabbath and sabbath</i>. Compare, <i>yom be-yomo</i> (daily) (Ex. 5:13).
BESIDE THE CONTINUAL BURNT-OFFERING. This means after the continual burnt offering. The Sabbath burnt offering shall follow it.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, he shall place the Sabbath burnt offering upon it.</i>

Verse 11

AND IN YOUR NEW MOONS. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard, who rests in paradise, says that <i>u-ve-roshe chodshekhem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and in the first of your months. Hence Rabbi Moses’ interpretation.</i> (and in your new moons) refers to the new moon of Nisan, for Scripture clearly states, <i>it shall be the first month of the year to you</i> (Ex. 12:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the first of your months (see previous note) refers to the first month of the year, i.e., the new moon of Nisan.</i> Scripture then goes on to say, <i>This is the burnt-offering of every new moon</i> (v. 14), that is, they shall offer this burnt offering<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The same burnt offering that was offered on the new moon of Nisan.</i> on every new moon. The Torah therefore adds, <i>throughout the months of the year</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A similar burnt offering shall be offered on the new moons throughout the year.</i> Rabbi Moses’ interpretation is correct. He is right even though the <i>yod</i> in <i>u-ve-roshe chodshekhem</i> (and in your new moons) argues against his interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Roshe</i> is a plural. Hence <i>roshe chodshekhem</i> seems to mean the many first days of the month. If the reference was to the new moon of Nisan, then Scripture should have read <i>u-ve-rosh chodshekem</i> (and on the first day of your months).</i> However, the fact that we find <i>hinneh chodesh machar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Not <i>hinneh rosh chodesh machar</i>.</i> (Behold, tomorrow is the new moon) (I Sam. 20:5) shows that what he says is correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Book of Samuel refers to the new moon as <i>chodesh</i>. This implies that an ordinary new moon is called <i>chodesh</i>, and the new moon of Nisan <i>rosh chodesh</i>. Otherwise Samuel would have referred to the new moon by the phrase <i>rosh chodesh</i>.</i>

OF EVERY NEW MOON. <i>Chodesh be-chodsho</i> (of every new moon) is similar<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In meaning.</i> to <i>shabbat be-shabbato</i> (of every sabbath) (Num. 28 :10).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>chodesh be-chodsho</i> is every new moon.</i> According to the plain meaning of the text there is no possibility of interpreting it any other way,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Some interpreted <i>chodesh be-chodsho</i> to mean when it (the moon) renews itself.</i> for there is no mention of the moon in our verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">If we take <i>chodesh</i> to mean new and <i>chodesh be-chodsho</i> to mean as when it renews itself, then the subject (the word moon) is missing from the text.</i> Furthermore, we only find the Hebrew form for the verb new in the <i>pi’el</i>, which has a <i>dagesh</i> placed in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, if our text intended to say “when it renews itself” the text would have read, <i>chodesh be-chiddusho</i>, not <i>chodesh be-chodsho</i>.</i> However, here<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>chodesh be-chodsho</i>.</i> the <i>dalet</i> has no <i>dagesh</i> in it.

Verse 15

AND ONE HE-GOAT FOR A SIN-OFFERING UNTO THE LORD. Compare, <i>upon which the lot fell for the Lord, and offer him for a sin-offering</i> (Lev. 16:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads for a “sin” unto the Lord. Lev. 16:9 teaches us that in our context “sin” stands for, a sin offering.</i> Note, in Hebrew the sin is connected to the sinner whenever the word <i>chattat</i> is followed by a <i>lamed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>lamed</i> prefaced to a word sometimes means of.

The <i>heads of the fathers’</i> houses refers to the already-mentioned princes (Num. 32:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The heads of the fathers’ houses are to be identified with the princes mentioned in Num. 32:6, for the princes mentioned in Num. 7 were no longer alive.</i> Moses told the children of Gad and the children of Reuben, <i>and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth</i> (Num. 32:24). Scripture therefore reads,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> <i>And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For they were to see to it that the tribes of Reuben, Gad and half of Manasseh kept their word.</i> <i>saying…</i>(v. 2). <i>When a man voweth a vow…he shall not break his word</i>. Scripture there<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">That is, here.</i> writes, <i>he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth</i> (v. 3).
OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. That they should relate this to the children of Israel.

Verse 3

UNTO THE LORD. He mentions God’s name. He vows as follows: If this comes to pass, then I will give the following sum to God, or I will fast.
SWEARETH. <i>Hishavah</i> (sweareth) is an infinitive. It is connected to a noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When an infinitive is connected to a word, that word is usually a verb. Compare, <i>ve-rappo yerrape</i> (and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed) (Ex. 21:19). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> There are many such cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, <i>shefot ha-shofetim</i> (when the judges judged) (Ruth 1:1).</i>
HE SHALL NOT BREAK HIS WORD. <i>Lo yahel</i> (he shall not break) means he shall not profane. The word <i>yahel</i> is not related to the word <i>mechilah</i> (forgiveness). We need tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">To ascertain the age at which one is obligated to keep one’s vows.</i> for Scripture speaks of a man and a women but does not tell us at what age a person is considered a man or at what age a female is considered a women.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">And is obligated to keep his or her vows.</i>

Verse 4

AND BINDETH HERSELF BY A BOND. Or bindeth herself by a bond.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-aserah</i> means or, not and.</i>[5.] HER BOND. <i>Essarah</i> (her bond) belongs to a different form.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>issar</i>.</i> It is not the same as <i>issar</i> (bond).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>issar</i> has a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>samekh</i>. In other words, <i>esar</i> and <i>issar</i> come from the same root but belong to different forms.</i>

Verse 5



Verse 6

DISALLOW. The word <i>heni</i> (disallow) means broke or nullified. Compare, <i>tenu’ati</i> (My displeasure) (Num. 14:34).
IN THE DAY THAT HE HEARETH. And not on any other day.

Verse 7

WHILE HER VOWS ARE UPON HER. In her father’s house. If her father does not nullify her vows, her husband may disallow her vows.

Verse 8



Verse 9

HE HEARETH IT. The word from her mouth.
AND THE CLEAR UTTERANCE OF HER LIPS. The oath.

Verse 10



Verse 11

AND IF A WOMAN VOWED IN HER HUSBAND’S HOUSE. If the widow vowed in an earlier time and her husband disallowed it, then she does not have to keep the vow in her widowhood. This speaks about a vow which she vowed regarding the future, and the husband died before the vow was to take effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise our verse would be repeating verse 9. For if a husband can annul his wife’s vow which was made when she was under her father’s charge, he can certainly annul avow made under his charge. Hence I.E. explains that our verse deals with a divorcee or widow who uttered a vow while married and had the vow nullified by her husband, who died before the vow became due. Our verse teaches that in such a case the nullification of the vow retains its efficacy.</i> The meaning of <i>selichah</i> (forgiveness) has been previously explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 14:19.</i>

Verse 14

TO AFFLICT THE SOUL. Even to afflict the soul. I have already explained that “affliction of the soul” refers to fasting.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 16:29.</i>

Verse 15

THEN HE CAUSETH ALL HER VOWS TO STAND. He has already caused all of her vows to stand.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-hekim</i> means: has already caused, rather than: and he will cause.</i> Scripture then explains how he caused her vows to stand, namely, because he held his peace in the day that he heard them.

Verse 16

THEN HE SHALL BEAR HER INIQUITY. For she is under his care.

Verse 17

BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS WIFE. His wife being a woman who is an adult.
BETWEEN A FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTER. If she has not reached adulthood. Hence Scripture reads, <i>being in her youth</i>.

FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This is not connected to the previous verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is not a continuation of the previous verse. It is an independent clause.</i> for the preceding verse states that these cities will be cities of refuge. However, it does not state for whom they shall serve as cities of refuge. Scripture then explains<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> that these six cities shall serve as cities of refuge <i>for the children of Israel, and for the stranger…who lives among them</i>.

Verse 19

WHEN HE MEETETH HIM. The <i>feh</i> of <i>bi-figo</i> (when he meeteth him) is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In place of a short <i>kamatz</i>. Compare <i>shomoro, kotvo</i>, etc.</i> like the word <i>shivri</i> (I break) in <i>when I break</i> (Lev. 26:26), for vocalization changes in the infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Not all infinitives follow the same vocalization.</i>

Verse 20

AND IF HE THRUST HIM. From a high place.
OR HURLED AT HIM. An inclining wall<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Pushed the wall down upon him.</i> or a deadly object.
LYING IN WAIT. I have previously explained the meaning of <i>bi-tzediyyah</i> (lying in wait).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 21:13.</i>

Verse 25

THEREIN UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE HIGH PRIEST. Some say that the meaning of <i>until the death of</i> is, until the investigation of.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Until the high priest investigates the death of the victim. For other interpretations see Filwarg.</i> They compare it to <i>And wisdom shall die with you</i> (Job. 12:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">They render this, and with you is wisdom searched out.</i> However, what they say is worthless. For <i>And wisdom shall die with you</i> means exactly what it says,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tamut</i> means shall die, not shall search out.</i> as does <i>until the death of the high priest</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Which is to be taken literally.</i> For the high priest atones on behalf of Israel, and this incident happened during his lifetime.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the murderer shall remain in the city of exile to remind the high priest of his failing. The high priest’s piety should have prevented the murder (see Rashi). Or, the murderer shall remain in exile to remind the high priest to pray constantly that God forgive Israel for the bloodshed in its midst.</i>

Verse 26

THE BORDER OF HIS CITY. <i>Et gevul</i> means beyond<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, from.</i> the border.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>et</i> is usually not translated. Hence I.E. points out that here it means from.</i> Compare, <i>et ha-ir</i> (out of the city) in <i>as I am gone out of the city</i> (Ex. 9:29).

Verse 27

BLOODGUILTINESS. I have already explained the meaning of <i>dam</i> (bloodguiltiness).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Our clause literally reads, he has no blood. Hence I.E. points out that blood means bloodshed. Thus our clause should be rendered, he is not guilty of bloodshed. See I.E. on Ex. 22:1.</i>

SO YE SHALL NOT POLLUTE. Do evil in secret.
SHED IT. <i>Shofkho</i> (shed it) is a verb.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Not a noun.

Verse 1

CAME NEAR. This chapter<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Like other chapters.</i> also is connected to the one that comes before it. When Moses commanded the Israelites to give the Levites cities from the inheritance of Israel [the heads of the fathers’ houses drew near].
THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS’ HOUSES. The reference is to the princes.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Of the tribes. Hence Scripture reads, <i>before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ houses of the children of Israel</i> (v. 1).</i>

Verse 7

[SO SHALL NO INHERITANCE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL REMOVE FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE.] The meaning of <i>tissov</i> (remove) is, shall not turn<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Shall not move around. <i>Tissov</i> comes from the root <i>samekh, bet, bet</i>, meaning to turn.</i> from here to there,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Emending <i>mi-po u-mi-po</i> (from here and from here) to <i>mi-po le-po</i> (from here to there) (Filwarg).</i> be it from them<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The tribe of Joseph, who argued their case before Moses.</i> or from others.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Any other tribe.</i>
The meaning of <i>so shall no inheritance be removed</i> is, no inheritance shall be removed from this day and onward even though they had not as yet inherited the land.

Verse 8

AND EVERY DAUGHTER, THAT POSSESSETH AN INHERITANCE. After the inheritance of the land. Scripture therefore states a second time, <i>So shall no inheritance remove</i> [<i>from one tribe to another tribe</i>] (v. 9).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, verse 7 speaks of the present. Verse 8 speaks of the future.</i>

MAHLAH, TIRZAH. Scripture first mentioned them<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In Num. 27:1.</i> in the order of their birth. It now mentions them in the order in which they were first taken by men in marriage.

Verse 12
