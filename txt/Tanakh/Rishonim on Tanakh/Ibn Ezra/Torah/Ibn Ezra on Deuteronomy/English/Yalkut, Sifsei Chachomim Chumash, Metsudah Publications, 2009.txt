<b>And you will tell your son.</b> That Hashem redeemed us from the house of slavery, and that He has performed so much kindness for us. Therefore we are obligated to fear His Name, for we already know how good He has been to us, and He continues to be good to us by giving us life, for His mitzvos are life to those who find them.

Verse 6

<b>Treasured people.</b> I have explained that this means something nice which cannot be found in every place. It has the same meaning in the verse, “Treasures of kings” (Koheles 2:8).

Verse 4

<b>Your garment.</b> Some say that this was miraculous, and others say that they brought many garments with them from Egypt. It is possible that eating <i>mon</i> prevented them from sweating.

Verse 9

<b>Do not be favorably inclined to him.</b> With belief in the heart.
<b>Do not listen to him. </b>In actions.
<b>Do not view him compassionately.</b> To refrain from executing him.
<b>Do not cover for him.</b> To leave him. Rather, reveal the matter so that the witnesses hear it from his mouth, and then you must execute him.

Chapter 14



Verse 1



<b>You are sons.</b> After you know that you are Hashem’s sons, and He loves you more than a father loves his children, “do not lacerate yourselves” for anything that He does, for everything that He does is for your good. If you do not understand, like small children do not understand all of their father’s actions yet they trust him, so should you do the same thing with Hashem. <b>For you are a sacred people. </b>You are not like the Canaanites, therefore do not act like them. The reason that this is adjacent to the verse, “Do not eat any abomination” is because you are sacred in your hearts and your mouths. You must be separate from all the other nations, and everyone who sees you should recognize that difference. You do not make yourselves bald between the eyes, and you do not eat living animals. If you are a sacred nation it is not appropriate that you eat impure things and make your souls impure.

Verse 26



<b>You and your household.</b> You are your sons are obligated, and your household is optional, for the <i>mitzvah</i> of coming to Yerushalayim three times a year is only on males. A woman who comes to this chosen place, like Elkana’s wives, receives reward.

Verse 27


<b>Who is in your city.</b> You must give the tithe to a Levi who lives with you. Do not say to him that you will keep the money and take it to another Levi elsewhere, or that you have already given it to another Levi elsewhere.

Chapter 15

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>End it.</b> The reason that I told you not to claim the loan money back from someone during the <i>shemitah </i>is because there is no need. If all Yisroel, or the majority, would listen to the voice of Hashem there would be no poverty amongst you such that you would have to loan money to the poor. You would all lend money to many gentiles.

Verse 7

<b>Do not harden your heart.</b> To speak to yourself good words.

Chapter 16



Chapter 17



Chapter 18



Verse 1

<b>They will not have — the <i>Kohanim,</i> the Levites…:</b> An exegetical explanation is that a <i>kohen</i> slaughters the peace-offerings. The right foreleg of the animal is a gift for his right arm which performed the slaughter, the jaw is a reward for the blessing, and the fourth stomach is a reward for checking the animal. The simple explanation is that these are the best cuts of meat. The Levites are also mentioned here because their task is to teach Torah in the gates.

<b>A wayward and rebellious son.</b> Wayward against Hashem and rebellious against his parents, if they fear Hashem.  
<b>Rebellious.</b> As in the verse, “For Yisroel is like a stubborn heifer”.

<b>Though they chasten him.</b> Before witnesses.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Gluttonous.</b> This means that he is gluttonous with meat, but it also includes anything that a person has a desire for.  
<b>And drunken:</b> He drinks too much and gets inebriated. This is like Epicurus, whose only desire in the physical world was to take pleasure in as many kinds of food and drink as possible.

<b>Moshe came.</b> To teach, for after he went to each tribe and commanded them he returned to the <i>Ohel Moed</i>, and all of Bnei Yisroel came to him there. Then he spoke the words of this song. 
<b> He and Hoshe’a, the son of Nun.</b> Similar to “Then Moshe and Bnei Yisroel sang” (Shemos 15:1). The intent here is also to increase Yehoshua’s standing in eyes of everyone. The verse refers to him as Hoshe’a, the name by which he was known to all, for only a few people knew that Moshe had renamed him Yehoshua.
