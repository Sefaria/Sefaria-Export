Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy



Chapter 1



Verse 1

In the name of the one who speaks righteousness and declares things that are right<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 45:19.</i> I will explain the Torah portion which begins with <i>These Are The Words</i>. Some say that the meaning of <i>eleven days’ journey from Horeb…by the way of mount Seir</i> (v. 2) is: Look. They traveled for forty years in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>eleven days’ journey from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea…by the way of mount Seir</i> (v. 2) is, that it took them 40 years to make a journey that normally takes eleven days.</i> This is the meaning of <i>And it came to pass in the fortieth year</i> (v. 3).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">They came to Kadesh-barnea in the fortieth year. Verse 3 explains verse 2.</i> However, they err, for Israel came up to Kadesh-barnea in the second year.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Moses sent out the spies in the second year following the Exodus. He sent out the spies from Kadesh-barnea. See Num. 32:8. It should be noted that Num. 13:3 identifies the place from which the spies departed as the wilderness of Paran. The commentaries explain that Kadesh-barnea is at the edge of the wilderness of Paran. See Weiser.</i> Actually, <i>And it came to pass in the fortieth year</i> is connected to <i>that Moses spoke</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Not to Kadesh-barnea.</i> (v. 3). I believe that <i>These are the words</i> (v. 1) refers to the precepts recorded in the Torah portions <i>Re’ah Anokhi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 11:26–16:17.</i> <i>Shoftim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 16:18–21:9.</i> <i>Ki Tetze</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 21:10–25:19.</i> and <i>Ve-hayah Ki Tavo</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 26:1–29:8.</i> which were already spoken by Moses when they were in the wilderness. <i>Moses spoke</i> (v. 1) should be read as if written twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1 is to be interpreted as if written: These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan. He spoke these words in the wilderness, in the Arabah, etc. He spoke them on the eleven days’ journey from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea.</i> This means Moses spoke,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">These precepts.</i> in the wilderness, in the Arabah, and in Suph from the day that they journeyed from Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets verse 1-3 as follows: These precepts, which Moses recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy beyond the Jordan, were first delivered by Moses in the wilderness between Horeb and Kadesh-barnea.</i>
BETWEEN PARAN AND TOPHEL, AND LABAN, AND HAZEROTH, AND DI-ZAHAB. Places not mentioned in the Torah portion <i>These Are the Stages</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Wherein Moses records the journeys of the children of Israel in the wilderness.</i> (Num. 33:1). On the other hand, they might have been mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">There.</i> under other names, for, observe, Senir<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A mountain in northern Israel. See Deut. 3:9</i> has three names.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It is also known as Hermon and Sirion. See Deut. 3:89.</i> There are many other such instances.

Verse 2

IT IS ELEVEN DAYS’ JOURNEY. This means that Moses spoke these things<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">These words of the Torah repeated by Moses.</i> in those eleven days. FROM HOREB. That they went from Horeb to Kadeshbarnea. I have already told<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is referring to his comments above.</i> you that the spies went out from Kadesh-barnea. After God swore that they would not enter the land,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 14:26-38.</i> no new commandment was given to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 20:1 (Vol. 4, p. 157).</i> No new commandment was revealed until the fortieth year. We find the aforementioned to be so.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah does not record any commandments or prophetic utterances during this period. See I.E. on Num. 20:1 (Vol. 4, p. 157).</i> <i>Took Moses upon him to expound this law</i> (v. 5) is proof of this. Moses expounded the laws<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For that is what <i>this law</i> refers to.</i> which he had stated between Paran and Tophel, for most of the commandments are in this book.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Book of Deuteronomy.</i> <i>According unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them</i> (v. 3), refers to the precepts given <i>beyond the Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah</i> (v. 1).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>Moses spoke…</i> (v. 3) is to be interpreted as: Moses spoke… according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them <i>beyond the Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah</i>, and in all the other places mentioned earlier in the eleven days’ journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea.</i> If you understand the secret of the twelve<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The last twelve verses of the Torah. According to I.E. the last twelve verses of the Torah were not written by Moses, for they record the death of Moses.</i> and also that of <i>So Moses wrote</i> (Deut. 31:22);<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. believes that Moses did not write this verse.</i> <i>And the Canaanite was then in the Land</i> (Gen. 12:6);<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. believes that Moses did not write this verse, for Scripture implies that the Canaanite was then in the land but not at the time that this verse was written. See I.E. on Gen.12:6 and the notes thereto (Vol. 1, p. 151).</i> <i>In the mount where the Lord is seen</i> (Gen. 22:14);<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Mount Moriah. However, in the days of Moses the temple had not yet been built. Thus Moses would not have said, <i>In the mount where the Lord is seen</i>. Hence this verse was inserted in the Torah at a later date.</i> and <i>behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron</i> (Deut. 3:11);<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the bed of Og, king of Bashan, slain by Moses. I.E. believes that Moses would not have had to prove the height of the king by pointing to his bed, for all of Israel then knew of his height. Hence the verse is post-Mosaic.</i> then you will recognize the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">That the first five verses of this book were not composed by Moses but at a later period. I.E. hints at the above because he did not want people to generalize and assume that there are other post-Mosaic additions in the Pentateuch. See I.E. on Gen. 36:31, “…Yitzchaki claims in his book that this chapter was composed during the reign of King Jehosaphat…Far be it for one to believe that our chapter was written in the days of Jehosaphat as Yitzchaki maintains. Indeed his book is fit to be burned” (Vol. 1, p. 341).</i> 

Verse 3

Some say that Moses died on the first day of Shevat.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This opinion holds that Moses died on the very day that he explained the Torah to Israel, namely, the first day of Shevat (v. 3).</i> Scripture states that Israel mourned thirty days (Deut. 34:8). They spent six Sabbaths there.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In the land of Moab following the death of Moses. Israel mourned Moses for 30 days (Deut. 34:8). The period of mourning concluded on the first of Adar. Israel crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of Nisan (Josh. 4:19). There are six Sabbaths between the first of Adar and the tenth day of Nisan. It should be noted that some manuscripts read: “Some say that Moses died on the first day of Adar. Scripture states that Israel mourned thirty days (Num. 34:8). They spent two Sabbaths there.” According to this opinion Moses reviewed the Torah for thirty days, and <i>that selfsame day</i> refers to the day that Moses finished reviewing the Torah. If this was the case, then two Sabbaths remained from the end of the period of Moses’ mourning and the tenth of Nisan. Both of these opinions take issue with Rabbinic tradition, which believes that Moses died on the seventh of Adar. According to Weiser the opinions quoted and rejected by I.E. are those of the Karaites. It is worth noting that I.E. does not quote the Rabbinic opinion.</i> They offer proof from <i>that selfsame day</i> (Deut. 32:48), i.e., that Moses read this book before all of Israel in one day and then died on that very day.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">They believe that <i>that selfsame day</i> refers to the day that Moses repeated the Torah to all of Israel.</i> However, this is no proof, for <i>that selfsame day</i> refers to the song.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The day on which Moses recited the song that opens with the words <i>ha’azinu</i> (give ear) (Deut. 32:1-43).</i> Look! Scripture states, <i>thou art to pass over the Jordan this day</i> (Deut. 9:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Israel did not cross the Jordan on the day that Moses uttered Deut. 9:1, for Scripture tells us that Israel crossed into Canaan after the death of Moses. We thus see that the term “that day” is not to be taken literally, but means at that time. The same applies to <i>that selfsame day</i>.</i>
IN THE ELEVENTH MONTH. I have explained the meaning of <i>ashte asar</i> (eleven) in my comments on the Torah portion <i>Nasso</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 7:72 (Vol. 4, p. 54).</i>

Verse 4



Verse 5

TOOK MOSES UPON HIM TO EXPLAIN. <i>Ho’il</i> (took upon himself) and <i>be’er</i> (to explain) are two verbs in the perfect attached to each other without a connective <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Two verbs usually are connected with a <i>vav</i>. Hence I.E.’s comments. According to I.E., <i>ho’il moshe be’er</i> (took Moses upon himself to expound) is to be explained as if written, <i>ho’il moshe u-ve’er</i> (Moses began and explained).</i> We find the same in <i>chamak avar</i> (had turned away, and was gone) (Cant. 5:6). Look! Moses began to explain to the children who were born in the wilderness what happened to their fathers. He related to them all the commandments. They would also hear from the mouth of the faithful messenger the Ten Statements which their fathers heard from God.

Verse 6

HOREB. This is Sinai,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s short commentary on Ex. 3:1.</i> as I have previously noted.

Verse 7

TURN YOU. Leave this place. AND TAKE YOUR JOURNEY. It is the style of Scripture to say, <i>u-se’u lakhem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>U-se’u lakhem</i> literally means, and journey for yourselves. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> (and take your journey). Compare, <i>lekh lekha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, go to you.</i> (get thee out) (Gen.2:1).

Verse 8



Verse 9

I AM NOT ABLE TO BEAR YOU MYSELF ALONE. Its meaning is similar to <i>thou art not able to perform it alone</i> (Ex. 18:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of our verse is, I am not able to do it alone.</i>

Verse 10

HATH MULTIPLIED YOU. In Egypt, and the blessing which your father blessed you was fulfilled.
[AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN.] This is a metaphor.

Verse 11

A THOUSAND TIMES. The word <i>pe’amim</i> (times) comes with <i>elef</i> (a thousand)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>elef</i> precedes the word <i>pe’amim</i>.</i> and with <i>me’ah</i> (a hundred).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">We also come across the phrase <i>me’ah pe’amim</i> (a hundred times).</i> The reverse is the case in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Arabic word for times comes before the number.</i>

Verse 12

YOUR CUMBRANCE. <i>Torchakhem</i> (your cumbrance) is related to the word <i>torach</i> (burden) in <i>They are a burden unto me</i> (Is. 1:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">They come from the same root and have a similar meaning.</i> <i>Your cumbrance</i> refers to teaching the commandments to the simple.
AND YOUR BURDEN. They demanded bread, water, and meat. Compare, <i>that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me</i> (Num. 11:11).
AND YOUR STRIFE. One with another.

Verse 13

GET YOU. The word <i>havu</i> (get) is irregular. Its <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Which is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>.</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>sheva na</i> and a <i>pattach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Beneath the <i>heh</i>. See I.E. on Gen. 11:4; 47:16, and the notes thereto (Vol. 1, pp. 139,140, 408).</i>
AND FULL OF KNOWLEDGE.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>vi-yedu’im</i> (literally, and known). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Men who were known, men whom all recognized.

Verse 14



Verse 15

CAPTAINS OF THOUSANDS. I have already explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 18:21 (Vol. 2, p. 365).</i>

Verse 16

HEAR. <i>Shamo’a</i> (hear) is an infinitive. It is like the word <i>zakhor</i> (remember) in <i>Remember the sabbath day</i> (Ex. 20:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zakhor</i> is an infinitive.</i> <i>Shamo’a</i> is short for <i>shamo’a shimu</i> (you shall surely hear) or <i>shimu shamo’a</i> (you shall surely hear).<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>shamo’a</i> literally means to hear. This makes no sense here. Thus I.E. believes that it is short for <i>shamo’a shimu</i> or <i>shimu shamo’a</i> (you shall hear), for it is good Hebrew style to combine a conjugated verb with an infinitive for purposes of emphasis.</i>
THE STRANGER THAT IS WITH HIM. I have already explained the meaning of the term <i>ger</i> (stranger).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 15:13 (Vol. 1, p. 173).</i>

Verse 17

RESPECT PERSONS IN JUDGMENT.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, you shall not recognize faces. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> To force judgment in favor of the person whom he [the judge] recognizes.

Verse 18

WHICH YE SHOULD DO. The reference is to the statutes and laws which he [Moses] taught them.

Verse 19

ALL THAT GREAT AND DREADFUL WILDERNESS. This is what the <i>eleven day’s journey</i> (v. 2) refers to.
[THE HILL-COUNTRY OF THE AMORITES.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the mountain of the Amorites.</i>] For Scripture states, [<i>And the Amorites, that dwell in that hill-country, came out against you…</i>] <i>and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah</i> (Deut. 1:44).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 1:2 notes that Kadesh-barnea is eleven days’ journey from Horeb via Mount Seir. However, our verse (according to I.E.’s interpretation) tells us that it is eleven days’ journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea via the mountain of the Amorites. Therefore I.E. points out that Deut. 1:44 indicates that mount Seir and the mountain of the Amorites are next to each other.</i> This<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The clause <i>as the Lord our God commanded us</i>.</i> means that we should go out toward the hill country of the Amorites.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>As the Lord our God commanded us</i> refers to the charge in verse 7 to march towards the Promised Land, namely, <i>turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites…</i></i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

TAKE POSSESSION. <i>Resh</i> (take possession) is vocalized like the word <i>shev</i> (sit).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Both words are <i>peh yods</i>. <i>Resh</i> comes from the root <i>yod, resh, shin. Shev</i> comes from the root <i>yod, shin, bet</i>.</i> <i>Resh</i> is related to the word <i>yerushah</i> (possession).
DISMAYED. <i>Techat</i> (dismayed) is similar<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In vocalization.</i> to the word <i>yiddal</i> (shall be made thin) in <i>That the glory of Jacob shall be made thin</i> (Is. 17:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Both words come from a double root and are similarly vocalized, except that in <i>techat</i> the <i>chirik</i> changes to <i>tzereh</i> because of the <i>chet</i>.</i> <i>Techat</i> comes from a double root.

Verse 22

THAT THEY MAY SEARCH THE LAND FOR US. <i>Veyachperu</i> (that they may search) is similar<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In meaning.</i> to <i>la-chepo</i>r (to search out) in <i>to search out all the land</i> (Josh. 2:3). One who digs (<i>chofer</i>) searches for that which is hidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-yachperu</i> (that they may search) and <i>la-chepor</i> (to search out) come from the root <i>chet, peh, resh</i>, which means to dig. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
BY WHICH WE MUST GO UP. At first.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">For strategic purposes (Weiser).</i>

Verse 23

AND THE THING PLEASED ME WELL. Because you all assented to this.

Verse 24



Verse 25

AND BROUGHT IT DOWN. Moses said this because of the height of the tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>and brought it down unto us</i> is, and they brought the fruit down from tree and delivered it to us.</i> Actually, however, he said this because they<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> were in the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">South of the Land of Israel (See I.E. on Num. 13:17, Vol. 4, p. 102). In other words, <i>and brought it down unto us</i> means: and brought the fruit to us from the north.</i>

Verse 26



Verse 27

AND YE MURMURED. <i>Va-teragenu</i> (and ye murmured) is similar to <i>rogenim</i> (murmur) in <i>And they that murmur shall learn instruction</i> (Is. 29:24). <i>Teragenu</i> (murmured) is in the <i>nifal</i>. Compare, <i>al te’atzevu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Which is in the <i>nifal</i>.</i> (be not grieved).

Verse 28



Verse 29

DREAD NOT. <i>Lo ta’artzun</i> means dread not. <i>Ta’artzun</i> is related to the word <i>ma’aritzekhem</i> (your dread) in <i>and let him be your dread</i> (Is. 8:13). It means the breaking of the heart by fear.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta’artzun</i> comes from the root <i>ayin, resh, tzadi</i>, which means to break. Thus <i>lo ta’artzun</i> literally means do not be broken. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 30

HE SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU. <i>Lakhem</i> means for you.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lakhem</i> literally means to you. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

TO PITCH YOUR TENTS. <i>La-chanotekhem</i> (to pitch your tents) is not a transitive verb,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">It does not mean to cause you to pitch your tents but to pitch your tents. Thus our verse should be rendered: to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, not to seek you out a place to cause you to pitch your tents [there].</i> for we do not find this form to be transitive.
TO SHOW YOU. <i>La-re’otekhem</i> (to show you) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> to show that the letter <i>heh</i>, which is placed before the direct object<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">This is probably a scribal error for the missing <i>heh</i> is the <i>heh</i> of the <i>hifil</i>.</i> (<i>le-hare’otekhem</i>) is missing.

Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36

SAVE. The <i>yod</i> in <i>zulati</i> (save) is superfluous, for the word is found without the <i>yod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zulat</i>. See II Kings 24:14.</i>
AND TO HIM WILL I GIVE THE LAND THAT HE HATH TRODDEN UPON. The reference is to Hebron.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">See I. E. on Num. 13:22 (Vol. 4, p. 103).</i> 

Verse 37

[ALSO THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH ME.] I have already shown you<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on Ex. 2:2 (Vol. 2, p. 32).</i> that the <i>nun</i> of the word <i>appo</i> (his anger) (Gen. 39:19) is swallowed by the <i>peh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>appo</i> is <i>alef, nun, peh</i>. In <i>appo</i> the <i>nun</i> drops out and a <i>dagesh</i> is placed in the <i>peh</i>.</i> However, it is present in the Aramaic.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>anpa, anpin</i> (Krinsky).</i> Furthermore, <i>appo</i> is also related to the word <i>anafta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>alef, nun, peh</i>.</i> (thou was angry) in <i>For though Thou was angry with me</i> (Is. 12:1) and <i>hitannaf</i> (was angry)<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>alef, nun, peh</i>.</i> in <i>Also the Lord was angry with me</i>. Moses mentions Caleb first, then Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Moses mentions Caleb before Joshua.</i> I have already explained why.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Caleb is mentioned first because he quieted the people. See I.E. on Num. 14:24,30 (Vol. 4, pp. 111,113).</i>

Verse 38

WHO STANDETH BEFORE THEE. This is <i>his minister</i> (Ex. 24:13; Num. 11:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The</i> one <i>who standeth before thee</i> means the one who stands before you to serve you (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 39

THAT THIS DAY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE. That day.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>This day</i> refers to the day that God meted out the punishment to the generation that exited Egypt, not to the day that Moses reviewed the Torah.</i>
OF GOOD OR EVIL. Scripture speaks of the majority.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Of their children. According to I.E. a person comes to the knowledge of good and evil at the age of puberty. See I.E. on Gen. 3:6 (Vol. 1, p. 68).</i>

Verse 40



Verse 41

AND DEEMED IT A LIGHT THING. The meaning of <i>va-tahinu</i> (and deemed it a light thing) is, and you said behold (<i>hen</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Behold, we are here (<i>hinnennu</i>), and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised (Num. 14:40).</i> Do not ask how a verb<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>va-tahinu</i>.</i> can be derived from a word that is connected to another word,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to an adverb or preposition. See Weiser.</i> for we find the same with <i>al</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>alah</i> (went up) is derived from <i>al</i> (on).</i> The same is true, as I have explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary on Ps. 88:16.</i> of the word <i>pen</i> (lest), for we find the word <i>afunah</i> (I am distracted) (Ps. 88:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Afunah</i> is derived from the word <i>pen</i>.</i> Others say that <i>va-tahinu</i> is related to the word <i>hin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">A liquid measure. See Num. 28:5.</i> Its meaning is a measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the meaning of <i>va-tahinu</i> is, they measured; i.e., they were ready to measure the mountain, that is, to take the mountain (Sarim).</i> However, this is far-fetched.

Verse 42



Verse 43



Verse 44

AND THE AMORITES…CAME OUT. The reference, as I have explained, is to the Canaanites.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 14:25 (Vol. 4, p. 112). Num. 14:45 tells us that it was the Canaanites who attacked the Israelites and beat them down, <i>even unto Hormah</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment. The Amorites were a branch of the Canaanite people. See I.E. on Gen. 15:16 (Vol. 1, p. 175).</i>
AS BEES DO. For they immediately chase after and bite whoever touches their abode.
AND BEAT YOU DOWN. I have explained the meaning of <i>va-yakketu</i> (and beat you down).<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 14:45 (Vol. 4, p. 115).</i> It is related to the word <i>ve-khatoti</i> (and I will beat to pieces) (Ps. 99:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Both words come from the root <i>caf, tav, tav</i>.</i>
UNTO HORMAH. Hormah is either the name of a place or an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning unto destruction, that is, until they defeated them. See I.E. on Num. 14:45 (Vol. 4, p. 115).</i>

Verse 45



Verse 46

SO YE ABODE IN KADESH. Kadesh-barnea.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">There was a city in the land of Moab called Kadesh. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
MANY DAYS, ACCORDING UNTO THE DAYS THAT YE ABODE THERE. In spying out the land. If one should argue, the spies alone abode there.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in Canaan. How then can Scripture say that Israel spent 40 days in Canaan?</i> [The answer is:] Scripture similarly reads, <i>After the number of days in which ye spied out the land</i> (Num. 14:34).<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 14:31 attributes the spying out of the land to all of the Israelites. So too here.</i>

Verse 5

CONTEND NOT WITH THEM. The word <i>titgaru</i> (contend) is similar to the word <i>yigareh</i> (strife) in <i>stirreth up strife</i> (Prov. 28:25). It means to disturb and err.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Strife is caused by disturbance and distance from that which is normal.</i>

Verse 6

YE SHALL PURCHASE FOOD OF THEM.

It means that Israel had no need for food and drink in these past years. <i>For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee</i> (v. 7) is proof.

Verse 10

THE EMIM. I have previously explained the meaning of Emim.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 14:5 (Vol. 1, p. 105).</i> Scripture tells us that Moab took Ar from the Emim.

Verse 21

BUT THE LORD DESTROYED THEM. Scripture relates that God destroyed a people on behalf of the Moabites<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>before them</i> means on behalf of the Moabites.

Verse 22



Verse 23

[AS FAR AS GAZA.] Scripture reads <i>as far as Gaza</i> because Gaza belonged to the Philistines and there already was a covenant between Abraham and Abimelech, namely, <i>that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son</i> (Gen. 21:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Israel would not be permitted to take Gaza.</i> Scripture relates that the Avvim took Gaza.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">From the original inhabitants.

Verse 29

AS THE CHILDREN OF ESAU…AND THE MOABITES THAT DWELL IN AR DID UNTO ME. Some say that <i>did unto me</i> refers to <i>thou shalt sell me food for money</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For the children of Esau did not permit the Israelites to pass through their lands.</i> If this is so, then what will they do with the inhabitants of Ar who were Moabites,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> about whom Scripture writes, <i>because they met you not with bread and with water in the way</i> (Deut. 23:5)?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, they did not sell you bread or water.</i> They were compelled to offer this interpretation<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>did unto me</i> refers to <i>thou shalt sell me food for money</i>.</i> because the king of the Edomites said, <i>Thou shalt not pass through me</i> (Ex. 20:18).

Indeed, Scripture reads, <i>Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir</i> (v. 4). However, the king, that is, the king of Edom, did not allow them to pass through his country, which was near Canaan. Israel therefore passed by Ar, as Scripture records (v. 18). Others say that they<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Ammonites and Moabites.</i> did not meet the Israelites<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">With bread and water.</i> but the Israelites bought<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Bread and water.</i> from them.

Verse 4



Verse 5

[I HAVE TAUGHT YOU.] Moses states, <i>I have taught you</i>, after saying <i>which I teach you</i> (v. 1), because he wants to add, <i>even as the Lord my God commanded me</i>.

Furthermore, the commandments are your glory over the nations. 6. YOUR WISDOM AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING IN THE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLES.

Hence I.E. comments that <i>asher tzivvekha</i> is to be read, <i>ka’asher tzivvekha</i>. In other words, it is to be interpreted as, which the Lord your God had commanded.</i> Or <i>tzivvekha</i> may be interpreted: which He commanded you not to make.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>commanded</i> has the meaning of prohibited.</i> Compare, <i>I will also command</i> (atzavveh) <i>the clouds</i> (from raining rain upon it)<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Is. 5:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Here too the word command has the meaning of prohibit.</i> Some say that the reference<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>temunat kol</i> (likeness of anything) refers to the making of an image of the stars.</i> is to the likeness of the stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For Deut. 5:8 speaks of <i>kol temunah asher ba-shamayim mi-ma’al</i> (even any manner of likeness, of anything that is in heaven above).</i> However, this appears to me to be far-fetched.

Verse 24

A DEVOURING FIRE. There is no <i>kaf</i> with the meaning of like prefixed to the word <i>esh</i> (fire). The meaning of <i>esh okhlah hu</i> (a devouring fire) is, like a devouring fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>esh okhlah hu</i> (a devouring fire) should be interpreted as if written, <i>ke-esh okhlah hu</i> (like a devouring fire). I.E. notes this lest anyone take our text to imply any corporeality in God.</i>
A JEALOUS GOD. With regard to idol worship. His jealousy devours like fire, which does not leave root or branch.

Verse 25

WHEN THOU SHALT BEGET CHILDREN. Moses first tells the Israelites that the Lord God is a jealous God. He then tells them what will happen to them if they make an image.
AND YOU SHALL DEAL CORRUPTLY. With regard to the rest of the commandments such as to murder or to commit adultery.

Verse 26

I CALL HEAVEN AND EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU THIS DAY. Some say the witness of heaven and earth refers to the angels and the human beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>I call heaven and earth to witness against you</i> means I call the angels in heaven and the inhabitants of earth to witness against you.</i> Others say that the reference is to the rain, as in <i>and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As a result of lack of rain.</i> (Lev. 26:19). However, it appears to me that heaven and earth are witnesses, and the Israelites and their children will always see them, for they are everlasting, as in <i>as the days of the heavens above the earth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>As the days of the heavens above the earth</i> means eternally.</i> (Deut. 11:21). <i>Hear, O ye mountains, the Lord’s controversy</i> (Micah 6:2); and <i>Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us</i> (Josh. 24:27) are similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">To heaven and earth bearing witness.</i> Should one dispute this on the basis of <i>For the heavens shall vanish like smoke</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies that the heavens are not eternal.</i> (Is. 51:6) and the like,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Other similar verses.</i> [then I respond] the one who makes this argument is awake but his heart sleeps.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">He does not understand the true meaning of the verse, for it is not to be taken literally.</i>

FEW IN NUMBER. I have already explained the meaning of <i>mete</i> (few).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mete</i> (few) means men of. Anything that can be numbered is deemed a few. See I.E. on Gen. 34:30 (Vol. 1, p. 330).</i>

Verse 28

WHICH NEITHER SEE, NOR HEAR. Scripture mentions the four senses.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Seeing, hearing, tasting, and smelling.</i> It is unnecessary to mention the fifth<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The sense of touch.</i> because it is thicker<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Coarser.</i> than the others.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The other senses are of a higher order. In other words, Scripture speaks only of the specialized senses.</i> Furthermore, it is the root of the life of the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">It is spread all over the body. All parts of the body are sensitive to touch.</i> Do not be amazed at the terms <i>u-vikashtem</i> (but…ye will seek) and <i>u-matzata</i> (and thou shalt find)<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>U-vikashtem</i> (but…ye will seek) is plural. <i>U-matzata</i> (and thou shalt find) is singular.

Verse 29

Verse 30



Verse 31

HE WILL NOT FAIL THEE. <i>Yarpekha</i> (fail thee) is the opposite of strengthen thee.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>yarpekha</i> (fail thee) means will cause you to weaken.</i>

Verse 32

FOR ASK NOW OF THE DAYS PAST. <i>She’al na</i> means ask now.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>na</i> means now. See I.E. on Gen. 12:11 (Vol 1, p. 154).</i>
SINCE THE DAY. The <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-min</i> (since) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-min</i> literally means to-from. Hence I.E.’s comment that <i>le-min</i> is to be interpreted as if written from (or since).</i> There are many such examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Of Scripture’s use of superfluous letters. See Vol. 1, p.

WHETHER THERE HATH BEEN. In his days.
OR HATH BEEN HEARD LIKE IT. The reference being to <i>Did ever a people hear…</i>(v. 33).

Verse 33



Verse 34

OR HATH GOD ASSAYED. Some say that <i>Elohim</i> (God) does not refer to the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to any god.</i> Heaven forbid. It most certainly refers to God.
ASSAYED. Scripture employs human language so that those who hear will understand.
BY TRIALS. This is a general term.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to all sorts of trials.</i> Or it refers to trials done via signs.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it refers to signs which were brought by God in bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt.</i> Compare, <i>and did the signs in the sight of the people</i> (Ex. 4:30).
AND BY WONDERS. The ten plagues. Scripture states, <i>and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders</i> (Ex. 11:10).
AND BY WAR. The reference is most probably to the killing of the first-born and to the punishments meted out to the gods of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 12:12.</i>
AND BY A MIGHTY HAND. The reference is to Israel’s departure by high hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Confidently and fearlessly. See Ex. 14:8.</i> The outstretched arm refers to the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud.
AND BY GREAT TERRORS. The drowning of Pharaoh and his army along with the splitting of the sea on behalf of Israel.
IN EGYPT. To the people of Egypt.

Verse 35

IT WAS SHOWN. <i>Horeta</i> (it was shown) is a <i>hofal</i>. The meaning of our clause is, God showed you all this so that you will know that He alone is God.
[THERE IS NONE ELSE.] This is to be understood according to the hint which I gave in my commentary on Koheleth on the verse that reads, <i>for one higher than the high</i> (Eccles. 5:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. there explains that the verse alludes to a hierarchy of 55 powers in heaven.</i> Hence Scripture reads, <i>There is none else</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">That is, God is the ultimate power.</i>
[GOD.] I have explained the meaning of <i>Elohim</i> (God) in the Torah portion <i>And Jethro Heard</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 18:19 (Vol. 2, p. 361).</i> Scripture states, <i>And God</i> (Elohim) <i>spoke</i> (Ex. 20:1); and <i>God</i> (Elohim) <i>answered him by a voice</i> (Ex. 19:19); <i>God</i> (Elohim) <i>is come</i> (Ex. 20:17); <i>where God</i> (Elohim) <i>was</i> (Ex. 20:18); for <i>Elohim</i> (God) was the speaker.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture describes God as speaking.</i> [I quoted these verses] because there are some who do not understand when one is being brief.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Hence one quote would be insufficient.</i> It is a deep secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Why Scripture refers to God by the term <i>Elohim</i>. I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 26) explains that <i>Elohim</i> means angels and that God is referred to as <i>Elohim</i> because God works through the angels. I.E. seems to imply that God revealed himself on Sinai through angels rather than through His own essence.</i>

Verse 36

THAT HE MIGHT INSTRUCT<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>le-yassereka</i> (literally, to discipline you).</i> THEE. He made thee to hear Him so that you would fear Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets <i>le-yassereka</i> as to put God’s fear in you. Hence his interpretation.</i> This is borne out when Israel said, <i>but let not God speak with us, lest we die</i> (Ex. 20:16). Look, you feared because of what your eyes saw and your ears heard. There was another reason why God made you hear His voice. He did so because He loved your fathers (v. 37), your fathers being three.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>thy fathers</i> (v. 37) refers to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i>

Verse 37

AND CHOSE THEIR SEED. <i>Be-zaro</i> (their seed)<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, his seed.</i> alludes to Jacob. If Scripture had read <i>be-zaram</i> (their seed), then the eight nations<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The six nations descended from Keturah the concubine of Abraham (Gen. 25:2), the descendants of Ishmael, and the descendants of Esau.</i> would have been included with us.
AND BROUGHT THEE OUT WITH HIS PRESENCE. <i>Befanav</i> (with His presence)<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, with His face.</i> means with His anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 26:17.</i> He was angry at Egypt. Others say that <i>panav</i> (presence) here is similar to <i>panav</i> (presence) in <i>And the angel of His presence saved them</i> (Is. 63:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains this verse as follows: And the angel which He sent with His mouth (the mouth is in the face) saved them; that is, God commanded an angel to save them.</i> However, I believe that <i>panav</i> (presence) here is similar to <i>panekha</i> (thine own person) in <i>and thou go to battle in thy own person</i> (Josh. 17:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>panav</i> is to be rendered presence.

Verse 38

AS IT IS THIS DAY. Close to this day.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">In the near future. I.E. comments thus because Israel had not as yet possessed the Land of Israel.</i> However, it really alludes to their possession of the land of the two Amorite kings, for Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh are called Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">They are part of the people of Israel. Hence if they possessed their land, Moses could speak to all of Israel that they already possessed the land of mighty nations.</i> Scripture similarly reads, <i>as Israel did unto the land of his possession</i> (Deut. 2:12). The reference is not to the future, as many explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">But rather to the land possessed by Reuben, Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh.</i> Proof of the latter is the fact that the psalm which opens with the words, <i>O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good</i> (Ps. 136) reads, <i>To Him that smote great kings</i> (Ps. 136:17). Now the psalm only mentions Sihon<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">King of the Amorites who dwelled in Transjordan</i> and Og<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">King of Bashan.</i> (Ps. 136:19,20). The psalm says, <i>And gave their land for a heritage…Even a heritage unto Israel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Even though their land was given to the above-mentioned two and a half tribes.</i> (Ps. 136:21,22). After stating that the Lord, <i>He is God; there is none else beside Him</i> (v. 35), Moses explains why by giving a very valuable reason. He begins with what the eye sees<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Unto thee it was shown</i> (v. 35).</i> and goes on to logic and the wisdom of the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>That thou mightest know</i>. I.E.’s point is that <i>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know</i> means what you saw with your eyes convinced your mind that the Lord alone is God.</i> He says, <i>Know that the Lord alone is God in the heavens above</i>, that is, in the heavens which are above human beings<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">The layer of air. I.E. distinguished between the Heaven of Heavens (the place of the stars and planets) and the firmament. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 21).</i> and upon the earth which is under people. <i>And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass</i> [<i>and the earth that is under thee shall be iron</i>] (Deut. 28:23) is proof that this interpretation<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">That heaven refers to the firmament and not to the Heaven of Heavens.</i> is correct. Now that you have seen the terrors, you shall place in your heart the conviction that you are obligated to observe God’s commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 40.</i> The observance of God’s precepts will also go well with you and with your children after you.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 40.</i>

Verse 3

THE LORD MADE NOT THIS COVENANT WITH OUR FATHERS. Alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">But also with us.</i>
BUT WITH US, EVEN US. The meaning of <i>ittanu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, with us.</i> (even us) is, but also with us.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads: The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us (<i>ittanu</i>). I.E. believes that this should be interpreted: The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers alone, but also with us. In other words, <i>ittanu</i> (us) should be interpreted as if written <i>gam</i> (also) <i>ittanu</i>.</i> It is similar to <i>thy name shall not be called any more Jacob</i> (Gen. 35:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thy name shall not be called any more Jacob</i> should be read as if written, Thy name shall not be called any more only Jacob. See I.E. on Gen. 35:10 (Vol. 1, p. 332).</i> Or it means the Lord did not make a covenant with our fathers who were in Egypt but only with us,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, no words have to be added to our verse and the clause is to be taken literally; i.e., the Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us.</i> for there were many in the camp who heard the covenant from the mouth of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The tribe of Levi and those who were under twenty when Moses sent out the spies to Canaan.</i> Moses therefore said even us, those who are here, and are alive. Moses’ words, <i>with you</i> (v. 4) and [<i>I stood</i>] <i>between</i> [<i>the Lord</i>] <i>and you</i> (v. 5) is proof of the correctness of this interpretation.

Verse 4

FACE TO FACE. Without an intermediary.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Face to face is not to be taken literally, for God has no face.</i> This means I spoke to you, although you did not see Me. The metaphor used in our verse is that of a person who speaks to another person face to face even though the person being spoken to does not see that speaker.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This would be the case when the speaker and the addressed would be in a pitch dark room. I.E.’s point is that Moses received a clear message.</i>

Verse 5

I STOOD BETWEEN THE LORD AND YOU. I have already explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Moses could say this because “for there were many in the camp who heard the covenant from the mouth of God.” See I.E. on verse 3.</i>
FOR YE WERE AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE FIRE. Even though you did not go up the mountain.
[SAYING.] The word <i>saying</i> is connected to the previous verse. Its meaning is, <i>The Lord spoke with you face to face…out of the midst of the fire</i> (v. 4) <i>saying</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>I am the Lord thy God</i>, etc.</i> It is possible that <i>I stood between the Lord and you</i> means I stood between the Lord and you after the revelation at Sinai. Its meaning is, God spoke with you face to face [at Sinai] and from that day on I stood between the Lord and you because you were afraid,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Of the fire.</i> as Moses goes on to explain.
AND WENT NOT UP INTO THE MOUNT. When I went up. Compare, <i>but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness</i> (Ex. 20:18). Do not pay attention to the fact that the word <i>saying</i> is far removed [from the end of verse 4],<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, do not be surprised that the last word in verse 5 is to be interpreted as the conclusion of verse 4.</i> for there are many such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Where a word is not connected to what immediately precedes it.</i> The speaker<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Moses.</i> did not separate the verses and sections.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This was done later.

See I.E. on Ex. 20:1 (Vol. 2, pp. 394-406).</i> One who cuts with two similar tools produces the same result. Scripture therefore interchanges <i>shav</i> (false)<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, vain.</i> (v. 17) and <i>sheker</i> (false) (Ex. 20:13),<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20:13 reads: <i>Thou shalt not bear false witness</i> (ed shaker).

Verse 17



Verse 18

The word <i>chamad</i> (coveted) has two meanings in Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is commenting on verse 18, which reads: <i>ve-lo tachmod</i> (neither shalt thou covet).</i> One is to rob, to extort, to take someone’s property by force and compulsion. This is the meaning of the word in <i>neither shall any man covet</i> (yachmod) <i>thy land</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>neither shall any man covet</i> (yachmod) <i>thy land</i> means no one shall desire your land, then the Land of Israel would be an undesirable land. Hence the meaning of <i>neither shall any man covet</i> (yachmod) <i>thy land</i> must be no one will take your land.</i> (Ex. 34:24). For if this is not its meaning, then the land is bad. But Scripture only comes to praise the land. The second meeting is to desire in the heart without acting.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">On the desire.</i> Now, <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (Ex. 20:14) is the ninth statement, and <i>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>) is the tenth statement.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation does not count <i>I am</i> as the first statement of the Decalogue. Therefore, it counts <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s house</i> and <i>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> as two separate statements.</i> According to this interpretation, <i>thy neighbor’s house</i> and <i>thy neighbor’s wife</i> are connected to each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they have a similar meaning even though they form two separate statements. Hence Scripture can invert these statements. I.E. comments thus because in Exodus the prohibition against coveting <i>thy neighbor’s house</i> precedes <i>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife</i>, while the reverse is true in Deuteronomy (Weiser).</i> On the other hand, <i>thy neighbor’s house</i> might be a general rule.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s house</i> is the tenth statement. Scripture first states the general rule and then goes into detail; that is, <i>Neither…thy neighbor’s house</i> includes your neighbor’s wife, servant, ox, ass, and all that he owns. According to this interpretation, <i>I am</i> is the first statement and <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s house</i> is the tenth.</i> The fact that Moses in this book [Deuteronomy] in which he explains the Torah, employs <i>ve-lo</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.E, <i>lo</i>.</i> <i>titavveh</i> (neither shalt thou covet) (v. 18) in place of <i>lo tachmod</i> (thou shalt not covet) (Ex. 20:14) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s house</i> is a general statement, for Moses explains it by using a different term in Deuteronomy.</i> Many say that one cannot sin with one’s thoughts and there is no reward and punishment for what one thinks. However, one can refute them by quoting many verses. I will not prolong my argument. I will merely point to the following: <i>A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts</i> (Prov. 6:18); <i>thou didst well that it was in thy heart</i> (II Chron. 6:8); <i>And to them that are upright in their hearts</i> (Ps. 125:4). Moses at the end<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Of his review of the commandments.</i> said, <i>in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it</i> (Deut. 30:14). The main purpose of the <i>mitzvot</i> is to perfect the heart. Most of them serve as a memorial.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">They remind the heart what it is to believe. See <i>The Secret of Torah, A Translation of Ibn Ezra’s Yesod Mora</i>, translated by H. Norman Strickman, Jason Aaronson, 1995, p. 78: “Some commandments serve as reminders of the fundamental precepts. For example, the Sabbath commemorates creation. Likewise, not permitting one’s slave to work on the Sabbath recalls the Exodus from Egypt. Similarly, the Pascal lamb, the <i>matzot</i>, the bitter herbs, the <i>sukkah</i>, the <i>mezuzah</i>, and the <i>tefillin</i> worn on the hand and head. Likewise, the <i>tzitzit.”</i></i> The distinction made between a sin committed deliberately and one committed inadvertently should convince them.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">That one can sin with one’s thought, for one who sins deliberately is punished while one who sins inadvertently is not.</i>

Verse 25

THEY HAVE WELL SAID. <i>Hetivu</i> (they have well) is a verb in the perfect. It comes from a root in which only two letters are sounded.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>tet, vav, bet</i>.</i>

Verse 26

OH THAT. Scripture does not say <i>mi yitten li</i> (oh that I) but rather <i>mi yitten la-hem</i> (oh that they).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the object of <i>mi yitten</i> is Israel not God.</i> The word <i>la-hem</i> (they) thus follows <i>ve-hayah levavam zeh</i> (such a heart as this).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>mi yitten ve-hayah levavam zeh la-hem</i> (oh that they). This literally reads, Oh that such a heart as this to them. I.E. believes that this should be read as if written, <i>mi yitten la-hem ve-hayah levavam zeh lahem</i> (oh that they had such a heart as this).</i> Note, God’s decrees are the source of all actions and movements.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In heaven and on earth.

Scripture therefore states, <i>O Lord, I know that man’s way is not his own</i> (Jer. 10:23). It similarly states, <i>O Lord, why dost Thou make us to err from Thy ways</i> (Jer. 63:17). Moses said, <i>therefore choose life</i> (Deut. 30:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">For man has free will to improve and develop his soul. According to I.E. a person is born with certain personality traits. Some of these traits may be evil. God may thus be said to determine man’s behavior. However, man has it in his power to overcome these evil traits. Thus man has free will.

Verse 4

HEAR O ISRAEL: THE LORD (<i>YHVH</i>) OUR GOD, THE LORD (<i>YHVH</i>) IS ONE.] That which the ancients, of blessed memory, transmitted regarding the reading of the <i>shema</i> is true,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbinic tradition there is a biblical command to recite <i>Hear</i> (shema), <i>O Israel</i>, morning and evening.</i> and there is no need for further investigation.

WITH ALL THY HEART, AND WITH ALL THY SOUL. The heart refers to knowledge.

Verse 7

AND THOU SHALT TEACH THEM. <i>Ve-shinantam</i> (and thou shalt teach them) is related to the word <i>shanun</i> (sharp) in <i>and a sharp arrow</i> (Prov. 25:18). The method of sharpening an arrow is well known.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">It is sharpened by consistent filing.

Perhaps I.E. is alluding here to his belief that the Torah cannot be fully understood unless it is interpreted in light of the studies of science (see <i>The Secret of the Torah</i>, pp. 33,34).</i> However, the transmitters of tradition taught that [our verse] refers to the time of reading the <i>shema</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">According to the sages <i>when thou liest down</i> means that we should read the <i>shema</i> at night, and <i>when thou risest up</i> refers to the reading of the <i>shema</i> in the morning.

The usual way to say in Massah is <i>be-massah</i>.</i> like the <i>bet</i> prefixed to <i>karkor</i> in <i>Now Zebah and Zalmona were in Karkor</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ba-karkor</i>.</i> (Jud. 8:10), and the <i>bet</i> placed before Telaim in <i>And numbered them in Telaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Heb<i>rew</i>, <i>ba-talaim</i>.</i> (I Sam. 15:4). I explained it<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The reason for the irregular vocalization. We do not know how I.E. explained the latter, for his commentary on Judges has been lost.</i> there. Massah was so called because Israel said, <i>Is the Lord among us</i> (Ex. 17:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Massah comes from the root <i>nun, sin, heh</i>. The latter means to test.</i> If He is, then we will serve Him. [Moses told Israel:] you have no need to test God. All you have to do is observe His commandments. If you do what is good in His sight, the Lord will do to you all that is good for you and will thrust out all of your enemies.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

TO THRUST OUT. The <i>heh</i> in <i>la-hadof</i> (to thrust out) is a root letter, as the word <i>hadofo</i> (cast it upon him) (Num. 35:22) proves.

Verse 20

WHAT MEAN THE TESTIMONIES. It means, Why, out of all people, is this burden placed upon us?<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the import of our verse is, Why out of all people is the burden of observing these testimonies placed upon us?</i> [21.] THEN THOU SHALT SAY. For God redeemed us from the house of bondage. Now, God did us this good. We are obligated to fear His name<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In the present.</i> because we have recognized that He did good to us in the past. He will do good for us in the future to keep us alive, for His commandments <i>are life unto those that find them</i> (Prov. 4:22).

Verse 21

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

AND IT SHALL BE RIGHTEOUSNESS UNTO US. Some say that this verse hints at the reward in the world to come for the observance of the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Targum Jonathan: And merit will be kept for us for the world to come</i>.</i> However, according to the plain meaning of the text, our verse teaches that following God’s will is the righteous thing to do, for He is our Master. I believe that the correct meaning is, all the nations shall see that we are righteous when we keep God’s commandments and statutes, which Scripture clearly states are righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 4:8.</i>

Chapter 7



Verse 1

AND SHALL CAST OUT. The <i>nun</i> in <i>ve-nashal</i> (and shall cast out) is a root letter. It is related to the word <i>yishal</i> (shall drop off)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Which comes from the root <i>nun, shin, lamed</i>.</i> in for <i>thine olives shall drop off</i> (Deut. 28:40).

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

FOR HE WILL TURN AWAY THY SON. The reference<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>He will turn away</i>.</i> is to “his son” mentioned earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous verse.</i> That is, do not give your daughter to his son<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The son of the Canaanites mentioned in the previous verse will turn aside your son, that is, his brother-in-law, from following the Lord.</i> or do not take the daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Canaanite.</i> mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous verse, for she too will turn your son away from Me. For other interpretations, see Krinsky, Meijler, and Filwarg.</i>

Verse 5

BUT THUS. <i>Ki im ko ta’asu la-ham</i> means but thus<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ki im</i>, means but thus. <i>Ki</i> literally means but, for, when; <i>im</i> means if. Thus <i>ki im</i> literally means but if. Hence I.E.’s comment that <i>ki im</i> should be rendered but thus.</i> shall ye deal with them<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">You shall destroy their images.</i> because <i>thou art a holy people</i> (v. 6) and should not defile yourself with pagan images drawn on pillars, or with <i>asherim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Sacred trees (Rashi).</i>

Verse 6

HIS OWN TREASURE. I have already explained the meaning of the word <i>segullah</i> (treasure).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 19:5 (Vol. 2, p. 375).</i> It means a desirable thing to which nothing comparable is to be found any-where. <i>Segullat</i> (treasure)<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, treasure of.</i> in <i>and treasure such as kings…have as their own</i> (Eccles. 2:8) is similar.

Verse 7

SET HIS LOVE UPON YOU, NOR CHOOSE YOU. You and not anyone else.

Verse 8

AND BECAUSE HE WOULD KEEP. <i>U-mi-shomro</i> (and because he would keep) is an infinitive.

Verse 9

HE IS GOD. This means this is truly the God who has the power and is faithful. <i>And is faithful</i> refers to the oath which God took. Scripture says that God is powerful and faithful, because there are others who are faithful but lack the power to keep their oaths and others who are powerful but are unfaithful.
WHO KEEPETH COVENANT AND MERCY WITH THEM THAT LOVE HIM. There are none higher then they.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">That love God.</i>
AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS. After them.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The future generations. God’s oath is conditional upon their keeping of His commandments.</i> Or its meaning is, them that love Him in their hearts, they are the ones who keep His commandments verbally and in practice.
TO A THOUSAND GENERATIONS. The one who says that the sphere of the constellations<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Which contains 360 degrees and moves one degree in 100 years.</i> completes its cycle at the end of thirty-six thousand years<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">After which this world ends (Krinsky). According to this interpretation God says that he will keep his oath until the end of time. This interpretation says that a generation lasts for 36 years and a thousand generations is 36,000 years.</i> errs, for we find it moving one degree in seventy years.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it completes its cycle once in 25,200 years.</i> The meaning of a thousand is, endless.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A thousand generations means endless generations.</i>

Verse 10

AND REPAYETH THEM THAT HATE HIM…TO DESTROY THEM.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>le-ha’avido</i>, (literally, to destroy him).</i> To destroy each individual that hates Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the combination of the singular with the plural. See Vol. 1, p. XVII.</i> Compare, <i>But righteous people is secure as a young lion</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Prov. 28:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Each one of the righteous people is secure as a young lion. Here too we have a combination of the singular with the plural.</i>
TO THEIR FACE. <i>Be-fanav</i> (to their face) means to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">To the previous person. Face is not to be taken literally.</i> Others say that <i>el panav</i> (their face) has the meaning of <i>befanav</i>, that is, because of His anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>panav</i> is to be rendered His anger. See I.E. on Deut. 4:37.</i> Its means that God will repay the wicked because they hated the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">And thereby angered God.</i>
TO DESTROY THEM; HE WILL NOT BE SLACK TO HIM THAT HATETH HIM. Some say that the meaning of our verse is that God rewards the wicked for his good deeds in this world and does not wait to reward him in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Erubin</i>, 22a; Onkelos and Rashi.</i> However, it appears to me that our verse contrasts the righteous<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, ones who love God.</i> who will exist<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">By living on through their children.</i> for a thousand generations with the wicked<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, ones who hate Him.</i> who will be destroyed. Scripture reads, <i>He will not be slack</i> because the wicked person thinks that his son or grandson shall live,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">And receive the punishment due him.</i> as in [<i>visiting the iniquity of the fathers</i>] <i>upon the children, and upon the children’s children</i> (Ex. 33:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the Torah states that the wicked themselves shall receive the punishment due them.</i>

Verse 11

THOU SHALT THEREFORE KEEP. It means as God keeps the covenant so shall you keep His commandments.

Verse 12

BECAUSE. <i>Ekev</i> (because) has the same meaning as <i>ekev</i> (reward) in <i>For ever, reward</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> (Ps. 119:112). It means the reward which will be given at the end. The meaning of <i>who keepeth covenant</i> in the previous verse (v. 9) is that God kept the covenant with Abraham. If you will be among those that love Him, then He will continue to keep the covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>that the Lord thy God shall keep with thee the covenant</i> in our verse is, God will continue to keep the covenant if you love him.</i> If you will be among those who love Him, then <i>He will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee</i> (v. 13). This is the meaning of <i>the covenant and the mercy</i> (v. 12).

Verse 13

THY BODY. Thy children.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>the fruit of thy body</i> means your children.</i> <i>Bitnekha</i> (thy body)<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, your belly.</i> is a euphemism.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For the sexual organ.</i>
AND THE FRUIT OF THY LAND. Scripture mentions com, wine, and oil because they are the most important foods.
THE INCREASE. I have already explained the meaning of <i>shegar</i> (the increase of).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders it as flock in his short commentary on Ex. 13:12. See also his long commentary on Ex. 13:12 (Vol. 2, p. 263).</i>
THY KINE. The word <i>alafekha</i> (thy kine) is similar to the word <i>alufenu</i> (oxen) in <i>Whose oxen are well laden</i> (Ps. 144:14).
AND THE YOUNG OF. <i>Ashterot</i> (and the young of) means and the flocks of. There was a great commentator in Spain<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. does not identify the commentator.</i> who explained why the Hebrews referred to cattle as <i>alef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As in <i>alafekha</i> (thy kine) and in <i>alufenu</i> (oxen).</i> and to sheep and goats as <i>ashterot</i>. He similarly explained the <i>ba’alim</i> and the <i>ashtaroth</i> (Jud. 10:6) as referring to the lord of the flowering constellation<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The planet which rules over “the ascent, the zodiacal sign appearing on the eastern horizon at a certain moment” (I. Efros, <i>Studies in Medieval Jewish Philosophy</i>, p. 202). This constellation is the first (<i>alef</i>) in the sky and its ruling planet, its lord (<i>ba’al</i>) was believed to have a powerful affect on fertility.</i> and that of the tenth.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The tenth constellation, Capricorn, which rules during the months of <i>tevet, shevat</i>, and <i>adar</i> when most of the sheep and cattle are born.</i> Scripture goes on to say God will not only bless the fruit of your body but there will not be a barren male, that is, one whose seed is infertile, among you or among your cattle. Furthermore, you will be healthy and avoid all sorts of well-known illnesses which normally befall people. You will similarly avoid abnormal, evil diseases.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the mention of the diseases of Egypt.</i>

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

AND THOU SHALT CONSUME. This is a commandment to consume them as one consumes bread, as <i>thine eye shall not pity them</i> proves.
FOR THAT WILL BE A SNARE UNTO THEE. The reference is to each one of their gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads, “Neither shalt thou serve their gods; for he will be a snare unto thee.” To be consistent, our verse should have read, neither shalt thou serve their gods; for they will be a snare unto thee. Hence I. E.’s interpretation.</i>

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

THE HORNET. <i>Ha-tzirah</i> (the hornet) refers to an illness which afflicts the body. It is related to the word <i>tzara’at</i> (leprosy).

Verse 21

THOU SHALT NOT BE AFFRIGHTED AT THEM. Only fear the Lord, who is great and awful.

Verse 22

LEST THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD INCREASE UPON THEE. The Gaon says that this is a sign regarding the time that they shall be victorious over them.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">When Israel will so increase that there will be no danger that the beasts of the field will overwhelm them, then they will know that it is time to drive out the Canaanites. See I.E. on Ex. 23:29 (Vol. 2, p. 519).</i> There is no need for the Gaon’s interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For the meaning of our verse is that God will not drive out the Cananites in one year because the Land of Israel was too large for those who left Egypt to settle all of it. See I.E. on Ex. 23:29 (Vol. 2, p. 519).</i> I have already explained it.

Verse 23



Verse 24

THOU HAST DESTROYED THEM. <i>Hishmidekha</i> (thou has destroyed them) is an infinitive even though it is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>heh. Hishmidekha</i> is a <i>hifil</i>. In such cases the <i>heh</i> is normally vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> in the infinitive. Compare, <i>hashmid</i>.</i> The word <i>hishir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a hifil.</i> (left him remaining) in <i>until there was none left him remaining</i> (Num. 22:35) is most likely similar to it. The word <i>otam</i> (them), which is the object,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>hishmidekha</i>.</i> proves that <i>hishmidekha</i> is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hishmidekha</i> is a third person (<i>hishmid</i>) plus the second person pronoun. Its meaning is, he destroyed you. However, with the word <i>otam</i> following, it is an infinitive, meaning you destroy them.</i>

Verse 25

THE SILVER OR THE GOLD THAT IS ON THEM. <i>Alehem</i> is to be rendered, that is on them. Or the meaning of our clause is, you shall not take money to leave them.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, <i>alehem</i> means for them, and the meaning of our clause is, you shall not take a bribe of money to leave them alone.</i>
SNARED. The <i>vav</i> in <i>tivvakesh</i> (snared) is in place of a <i>yod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>tivvakesh</i> is <i>yod, kof, shin</i>.</i> Compare, <i>yakoshti</i><sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>yakoshti</i> is <i>yod, kof, shin</i>.</i> <i>lakh</i> (I have laid a snare for thee).

Verse 1

ALL THE COMMANDMENT. This means, if you want to keep the commandments so that you may live then <i>remember all the way</i> (v. 2).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, verse 1 and 2 are not independent statements. Furthermore, <i>ve-zakharta</i> (and thou shalt remember) is to be rendered, then thou shalt remember.</i>

Verse 2

THAT HE MIGHT AFFLICT THEE, TO PROVE THEE. I have already explained it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">How to understand “to prove thee.” The point is, since God knows the future, what point is there in testing people. I.E. explains divine tests in his comments on the “binding of Isaac.” He writes, “The reason God tested Abraham was to reward him.” See I.E. on Gen. 22:1 (Vol. 1, pp. 221-223).</i>

Verse 3

AND HE AFFLICTED THEE. On the way.
AND SUFFERED THEE TO HUNGER. Before the coming of the manna.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Before the manna descended, Israel suffered hunger. See Ex. 16:3.</i> Or via the manna itself, for it was light and did not satisfy their heart’s desire.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 21:5.</i> However, this is not so.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For Moses goes on to speak positively of the manna in verse 3.</i> It most probably refers to other desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Which they could not fulfill in the wilderness (Weiser).</i>
KNOW. <i>Yade’un</i> (know) is spelled with a <i>nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form of this word is <i>yade’u</i>.</i> So too the word <i>tzakun</i> (poured out)<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form of the word is <i>yatzeku</i>. Be that as it may, the <i>nun</i> is not part of the normal form of this word.

THAT HE MIGHT MAKE THEE KNOW. <i>Hodi’akha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hodi’a</i> plus a pronominal suffix.</i>(make thee know) is an infinitive.
BREAD. Which people always eat.
EVERY THING THAT PROCEEDETH OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE LORD. It means that which God has decreed. Compare, <i>As the word went out of the king’s mouth</i> (Esth. 7:8). The meaning of our verse is, man does not live by bread alone but by the power,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In the nature of the food. In other words, God created the world in such a way that man can exist on all types of food.

According to the second interpretation the verse refers to divine providence. The latter was demonstrated by the manna which came from on high.</i> by the command of God. This is the meaning of <i>that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord</i>. The fact that you did not eat bread and you lived is proof of this.

Verse 4

THY RAIMENT. Some say via a miracle. Others say that the Israelites brought out many garments from Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of our clause is that they always had garments to wear.</i> However, it is most likely the nature of manna not to produce sweat.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hence their garments <i>waxed not old upon</i> them.</i>
NEITHER…SWELL. The word <i>batzekah</i> (swell) is related to the word <i>batzek</i> (dough)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Dough swells.</i> in <i>And they baked…the dough</i> (Ex. 12:39). It is usual for the feet of a wayfarer who walks great distances to swell. It is possible that God gave the Israelites strength or that he led them slowly.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hence their feet did not swell.</i>

Verse 5

AND THOU SHALT CONSIDER IN THY HEART.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, you shall know in your heart. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> You shall know by believing in your heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">What you claim to know should be what your heart believes.</i> The latter is what counts most.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">True belief. I.E. says, “If belief is lacking, then the observance of the commandments is meaningless and serves no purpose” (<i>The Secret of the Torah</i>, p. 91).</i> God will reward you by bringing you into the good land, because you obeyed the God who chastens you. You obeyed God even though in order to chasten you, He afflicted you with thirst and made you suffer hunger.

MULTIPLY. The <i>yod</i> in <i>yirbeyun</i> (multiply) is in place of a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">For the root of <i>yirbeyun</i> is <i>resh, bet, heh</i>.

OF FLINT. <i>Tzur ha-chalamish</i> (the rock of flint) means the mighty rock.

Verse 16



Verse 17

THIS WEALTH. <i>Chayil</i> means wealth. Compare, the word <i>chelam</i> (their wealth) in <i>And leave their wealth to others</i> (Ps. 49:11). <i>Chelam</i> refers to that which they acquired by their efforts and strength.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chayil</i> means strength.

Verse 18

BUT THOU SHALT REMEMBER. This means if the thought <i>My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth</i> should enter your mind, then remember the One who gives you power.

Verse 19



Verse 20

BECAUSE. The word <i>ekev</i> (because) refers to payment at the end. It refers both to reward<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 7:12.</i> and to punishment.

AND BEAT IT. Into fine dust like the dust of the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads, until it was fine to dust (<i>le-afar</i>). I.E. explains that <i>le-afar</i> (to dust) should be interpreted as <i>ke-afar</i> (as dust) and our text interpreted, until it was as fine as dust (Weiser).</i>

Verse 22

AND AT TABERAH. Taberah is probably the name of a place. Israel camped there for but one day.

Chapter 10



Verse 1

AT THAT TIME. During the forty days that are mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 9:5.</i>
AN ARK OF WOOD. The transmitters of tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmudic sages.</i> of blessed memory, said that Moses first<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Before ascending Mount Sinai to receive the second tablets. See <i>Tanchuma</i>, Ex. 1:10, and Rashi.</i> made another ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">That is, other than the one later made by Bezalel. Thus the ark mentioned in our verse is not to be identified with the ark made by Bezalel which was placed in the Holy of Holies (Ex. 25:1-22; 37:1-9). The sages believed that God gave Moses the second pair of tablets at the end of 80 days and that Moses made an ark to hold them temporarily. See Rashi on our verse.</i> Proof of the latter is, <i>So I made an ark</i> (v. 3), which is followed by <i>and hewed two tables of stone</i> (v. 3) <i>and put the tables in the ark which I had made</i> (v. 5). Now their minds are superior to our minds, for it appears to us<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Contrary to their opinion.</i> that <i>And the glory of the Lord abode</i> (Ex. 24:16) is connected with the glory which the elders saw (Ex. 24:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ex 24:16-18 reads: <i>And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the</i> cloud…<i>And Moses entered in the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount; and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights</i>. According to the rabbis this verse relates to the giving of Torah (see Rashi on Ex. 24:16). Also, according to the rabbis, the forty days which this verse states Moses spent on the mountain starts with the seventh of Sivan. There are 120 days between that day and Yom Kippur when, according to Rabbinic tradition, Moses descended with the second pair of tablets. Moses thus spent 120 days on Mount Sinai. See <i>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chapter 46. I.E. disagrees. He believes that the plain meaning of the text does not allow one to conclude that Moses spent 120 days on Mount Sinai. The text merely says that the elders of Israel ascended Mount Sinai and had a vision of God (Ex. 24:1-12). It does not say which day they descended. Following this vision the cloud covered the mountain for seven days, after which God called Moses to ascend the mountain for 40 days. We thus do no know what day Moses ascended the mountain, and therefore, cannot calculate 120 days between revelation and Yom Kippur. Thus Moses did not necessarily spend 120 days on Mount Sinai.</i> We do not know when Moses ascended,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To receive the tablets.</i> for according to the plain meaning of the text it appears that Moses fasted for only eighty days,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis, <i>Now I stayed in the mount, as the first time forty days and forty nights</i> is not a repetition of Deut. 9:25 but speaks of an additional 40 days. Furthermore, <i>as the first time forty days and forty nights</i> indicates that as he fasted the first time, so did he now.</i> for the meaning of <i>Now I stayed in the mount</i> (v. 10) repeats what was said earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 9:25.</i> It means when I stayed on the mountain during those forty days<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in Deut. 9:25.</i> God listened to me and said, <i>Arise, go before the people</i> (v. 11), the reference being to <i>And now go, lead the people</i> (Ex. 32:34). The making of the ark of wood (v. 3) was thus by command.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>So I made an ark of wood</i> is to be interpreted, I commanded that an ark of wood be made.</i> It refers to the ark made by Bezalel.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 37:1-9.</i>

Verse 2



Verse 3

SO I MADE AN ARK. By command.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">By commanding Bezalel to make it.</i> The meaning of <i>And Moses assembled</i> (Ex. 35:1) should be interpreted, and Moses had assembled.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 35:1 tells us that Moses gathered the people and told them to make the tabernacle and its furniture, the ark included. Ex. 35 follows the account of the giving of the second tablets, which is recorded in Ex. 34. Now, since I.E. believes that the ark spoken of in our chapter is to be identified with the ark made by Bezalel, he interprets <i>And Moses assembled</i> as And Moses had assembled Israel; that is, Moses gathered Israel and commanded them to make the tabernacle before he ascended Mount Sinai a second time to receive the second tablets.</i> I have already shown you many such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Where a perfect is to be taken as a pluperfect.

Verse 6

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED FROM BEEROTH-BENEJAAKAN TO MOSERAH; THERE AARON DIED. This verse is placed here<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Amidst the account of the golden calf.</i> because Moses said, <i>And I prayed for Aaron also the same time</i> (Deut. 9:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Saying, <i>And I prayed for Aaron also at that time</i>, Moses indicated that Aaron did not go along with those who worshipped the calf.</i> Moses indicated that Aaron did not die until the fortieth year (Num. 33:38).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And not after the incident of the golden calf, for God accepted Moses’ prayer.</i> Moses’ statement, <i>At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi</i> (v. 8), which took place at Mount Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Not after the death of Aaron.</i> as I explained in the Torah portion which opens with <i>And The Lord Spoke</i> (Num. 1:1),<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 3:1.</i> is proof that this is its meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">That our verse is a parenthetical statement.</i> The early authorities<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis of the Talmud.</i> tell us that Israel backtracked.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">According to Num. 20:22-29, Aaron died at Mount Hor, not at Moserah. Furthermore, Num. 33:31 tells us that Israel journeyed from Moseroth to Bene-jaakan. The rabbis identify Bene-jaakan with Beeroth-benejaakan and Moserah with Moseroth. Additionally, the rabbis identify Hor-haggidgad (Num. 33:32) with Gudgod (v. 7). Thus according to the rabbis, verses 6 and 7 contradict Num. 33:31,32. The rabbis solve the contradictions by saying that Israel backtracked from Mount Hor to Moserah. See Rashi: “Moses reproved Israel saying that when Aaron died on Mount Hor at the end of 40 years and the clouds of glory departed you feared war with the king of Arad, and you appointed a leader that you might return to Egypt, and you turned backwards 8 stages unto Bene-jaakan and from there to Moserah. There the sons of Levi fought with you, and they slew some of you, and you some of them, until they forced you back on the road along which you had retreated. From Moserah you returned to Gudgod, (Num. 33:33), that is identical with Hor-haggidgad (v. 8).” Also, see <i>Yerushalmi Sotah</i>, chapter 1, Hal. 10; <i>Yoma</i>, Chap 1, Hal. 1; <i>Seder Olam</i>, chapter 9.</i> However, what shall we do with the clause, <i>there Aaron died, and there he was buried</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Which indicates that Aaron died and was buried at Moserah.</i> Rabbi Isaac ibn Giat the Spaniard,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">An eleventh-twelfth century scholar.

There is no need for this interpretation. On the contrary, I believe that Beeroth-benejaakan is not to be identified with Bene-jaakkan; neither is Moserah the same as Moserot (Num. 33:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Thus our verse does not contradict Num. 33:31.</i> In reality Kadesh<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Not Bene-jaakan, for Num. 33:37 relates that Israel journeyed from Kadesh to Mount Hor.</i> is called the wilderness of Beeroth-benejaakan, and the wilderness of Mount Hor is called Moserah.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hence our verse does not contradict Num. 20:22-29.</i> There are many such examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Where a place has two names and Scripture refers to it in one place by one name and in another place by another name.</i> Do you not see that Scripture says the wilderness of Shur (Ex. 15:22)?

Verse 7

FROM THENCE THEY JOURNEYED UNTO GUDGOD. The latter is not to be identified with Hor-haggidgad (Num. 33:32).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">To which Israel journeyed from Bene-jaakkan.</i> On the contrary, it is a general term for Zalmonah and also for Punon and Oboth (Num. 33:43,44).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers tells us that Israel journeyed from Mount Hor to Zalmonah, Punon and Oboth (Num. 33:43,44).</i>
[TO JOTBAH.] Jotbah is the place that is also called Beer,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>be’er</i> (well). It is not to be identified with Jotbah in Num. 33:33 to which Israel journeyed from Hor-haggidgad.</i> for Scripture reads, <i>And from thence to Beer</i> (Num. 21:16). This is what a <i>land of brooks of water</i> (v. 7) refers to, for the nobles of the people dug it with their staves and water came forth (Num. 21:18). This verse, namely, <i>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod</i> is connected to <i>and Eleazar…ministered</i> (v. 6).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Israel did not backtrack after Aaron’s death, for the journey to Gudgod, took place after Aaron died. See note 28.</i> Now, I have already explained to you that Israel did not offer sacrifices after they journeyed from Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 29:42 (Vol. 2, p. 621).</i> It is possible that they offered them when they came to Zalmonah<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. on verse 7, Gudgod is a general name for Zalmonah and Punon.

Moses waited until the new year began, on the first day of the seventh month, for Eleazar to begin serving as <i>kohen gadol</i> (high priest).</i> He ministered in a place called Beer<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Or Jotbah.</i> on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Gudgod and Jotbah are mentioned after <i>and Eleazar…ministered</i>.

Because when Israel worshipped the calf, God separated the tribe of Levi to carry the ark and to stand before the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi</i> does not refer to when Israel came to Jotbah but rather to what happened at Sinai (v. 8).</i>

Verse 8

HE DOTH EXECUTE JUSTICE.

THE BLESSING, IF YE SHALL HEARKEN.

Verse 1



Verse 2

YE SHALL SURELY DESTROY ALL THE PLACES…THEIR GODS. Rabbi Jonah the grammarian says that <i>et elohehem</i> (their gods) is lacking a <i>vav</i>, for the meaning of the phrase is, and their gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Jonah maintains that our verse should be read: Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served, “and” their gods. He interprets this as meaning, You shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that you are to dispossess worshipped. You shall also destroy their gods.</i> However, he contributes nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For as I.E. goes on to note, <i>et elohehem</i> is connected to <i>asher avedu sham</i> (wherein they served).</i> <i>Et elohehem</i> is most certainly connected to <i>asher avedu sham</i> (wherein they served).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For our text reads, <i>et elohehem</i> (their gods) not <i>ve-et elohehem</i> (and their gods).

EVERY LEAFY TREE. The words <i>ra’anan</i> (leafy) and <i>sha’anan</i> (at peace) are always spelled with two <i>nuns</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently believed that the root of <i>sha’anan</i> is <i>shin, alef, nun</i> and that of <i>ra’anan is resh, ayin, nun</i>.

Verse 3

THEIR ASHERIM. <i>Asherim</i> are trees.
AND YE SHALL DESTROY THEIR NAME. So that they not be mentioned.

Verse 4

YE SHALL NOT DO SO. This means do not sacrifice on the hills and the mountains. Do so only in the place where the Lord shall put His name.

Verse 5

TO PUT HIS NAME THERE. Compare, <i>Where I cause My name to be mentioned</i> (Ex. 20:21).

Its meaning,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of, <i>Ye shall not do after all that we do here this day.

Verse 9

TO THE REST. So that they and their children do not have to travel.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">From place to place.

Verse 10



Verse 11

AND ALL YOUR CHOICE VOWS. The commandment requires that offerings made by vows be brought from the choicest.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Of the animals.

Verse 13

Scripture repeats <i>in every place that thou seest</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">After having stated this already in verse 5.</i> (v. 13) because it wants to exclude meat eaten out of desire.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Meat which is not sacred.</i> Scripture states the unclean and the clean (v. 15) with regard to meat eaten out of desire because peace offerings are sacred and one who eats sacred meat in a state of impurity incurs the penalty of excision.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the law of clean and unclean does not apply to the eating of nonsacred meat (v. 15).</i>

Verse 2

IF THERE ARISE IN THE MIDST OF THEE. Scripture reads <i>in the midst of thee</i> because there is no prophet except from among Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Prophesy is found only among Israelites. I.E. considered Balaam an astrologer who claimed to be a prophet. See I.E. on Num. 22:28 (Vol. 4, p. 186). This is also the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi. See Book I of the Kuzari.</i> This section is connected to the previous one<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 12:29-31.</i> because they both deal with idol worship, for the burning of the children (Deut. 12:31) was an act of idol worship. Our verse deals with a prophet who claims that God, or God’s messenger, spoke to him while he was awake or in a dream. Some say that it is possible that the prophet<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in our verse.</i> was one of those who steal God’s word (Jer. 26:30). They explain that a true prophet said that a certain sign would appear to verify his word.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The true prophet gave a sign to show that what he said was true.</i> Someone heard this and related the sign so that it should bear witness for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The false prophet used the sign given by the true prophet for his own purposes.</i> Others say that even if the sign or a wonder came to pass<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">By the prophet.</i> we do not believe him,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The prophet.</i> for what he says<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">His call to serve other gods.</i> contradicts reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Rabbi Saadiah Gaon, <i>Sefer Ha-Emunot Ve-Ha-De’ot</i>, Treatise III.</i> I believe that the terms wonder<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>mofet</i>.</i> and sign<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ot</i>.</i> apply also<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to referring to supernatural events, as in <i>Or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders</i> (Deut. 4:34).</i> to symbolic acts.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The terms <i>mofet</i> (wonder) and <i>ot</i> (sign) usually refer to a miraculous act such as changing a rod into a serpent or water into blood.

Also Scripture’s statement with regard to the plagues,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Which would befall Israel.</i> <i>And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder</i> (Deut. 28:46).

[PUTTETH YOU TO PROOF.] Scripture says, <i>for the Lord…putteth you to proof</i>, because God left the prophet<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Who tried to lead the Jews into idolatry.</i> alone and did not kill him.

IF THY BROTHER…ENTICE THEE. This means even thy brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>If thy…brother entice thee</i> is to be understood as even if your brother entices you, for the law applies to anyone who entices you.</i> 
The import of <i>thy mother</i> is, you<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">And your brother were in one womb. Thus the meaning of our verse is, even if your brother who was in one womb with you entices you. Our verse speaks of <i>thy brother, the son of thy mother</i>. This is an appellation rarely used in Scripture. The question thus arises, “Why did Scripture add <i>the son of thy mother</i>?” Furthermore, why did the Torah not describe the brother as the son of thy father? Hence I.E. comments that the matter from which a person is made comes from the mother; the father’s sperm (so I.E. believed) shapes the matter. Thus a person, biologically speaking, is closer to a brother from a mother than to a brother from a father, and probably has closer emotional ties to him. Hence Scripture states, even if your brother who is made of the same matter as you entices you, do not listen to him.</i> were in one womb. The mother is like matter and the father is like form.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Form gives shape to matter. Form is intangible. Different men will give different form to the matter produced by the same woman. However, all of the children will share the same matter. Hence Scripture speaks of <i>thy mother</i> not thy father.</i> Very few people understand the nature of form.

Chapter 14



Verse 1

YE SHALL NOT CUT YOURSELVES. <i>Titgodedu</i> (ye shall not cut yourselves) means the same as <i>ve-seret</i> (cuttings) in <i>cuttings…for the dead</i> (Lev. 19:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>lo titgodedu</i> means you shall not cut yourselves.</i> <i>Titgodedu</i> is related to the word <i>gedudot<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Both words come from the root <i>gimel, dalet, dalet</i>.</i></i> (cuttings) in <i>Upon all the hands are cuttings</i> (Jer. 48:37).
NOR MAKE ANY BALDNESS. As the nations do unto this very day.
[CHILDREN.] The meaning of <i>children</i> is, now that you know that you are children of God and that the Lord loves you more than a father loves his son, do not cut yourselves over anything that God does, for whatever the Lord does is for the good. If you do not understand God,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If you do not understand God’s actions.</i> then act like small children who do not understand what their father does but nevertheless rely upon him. <i>For thou art a holy people</i> (v. 2) and you are not like all the Canaanites. You shall therefore not imitate their practices. The section opening with the words <i>Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing</i> (v. 3) follows because Scripture says, as it were, you are holy in your heart and in your mouth. You shall be separated from the nations. All who see you shall recognize you, for you will not make yourself bald for the dead and you do not eat all living creatures. If you are a holy people, then it is unfitting for you to eat that which is unclean and defiles one’s soul.

Verse 2



Verse 3

ANY ABOMINABLE THING. Anything which is abominable to a pure soul such as anything that crawls on the ground.

Verse 11

OF ALL CLEAN BIRDS YOU MAY EAT. <i>Tzippor</i> (birds) is a general term.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">It does not refer to a specific species of birds.</i> The dove and turtledove are subcategories of the general term “birds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 15:10 reads, “but the birds (<i>tzippor</i>) divided he not.” The reference there is to the dove and the turtledove mentioned in Gen. 15:10.

However, in the Torah portion <i>Re’eh Anokhi</i>, the number is 21. The answer is found in the science of logic, for <i>da’ah</i> (Lev. 11:14) is a supreme kind that includes both the <i>dayyah</i> and the <i>ra’ah</i> (Deut. 14:13).”</i> as Scripture now elaborates.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it lists some of the particulars, viz., the <i>dayyah</i> (the kite), the <i>ayyah</i> (the falcon), and the <i>ra’ah</i> (the glede), which are included in the category <i>da’ah</i> (falcon) in Leviticus.</i>

WHICH IS BROUGHT FORTH IN THE FIELD YEAR BY YEAR. Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi the Spaniard, who rests in Eden, said <i>that which is brought forth in the field</i> is connected to the word <i>seed</i>, and our verse is to be understood as, you shall tithe the seed which is brought into the field for planting.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the produce from the seed. Rabbi Yehuudah believes that <i>yotze</i> (is brought forth) is intransitive. Hence his interpretation.</i> However, I believe that we are to interpret the verse according to its plain meaning. Our clause refers to the produce which the field brings forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, that <i>yotze</i> (is brought forth) is transitive. Our verse is to be understood as follows: You shall tithe the seed which the field produces.</i> Should some dispute this and argue that Scripture reads <i>ha-yotze</i> (which is brought forth), and <i>yotze</i> (brought forth) is an intransitive verb, then we will show him <i>ha-ir ha-yotzet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha-yotzet</i> is the feminine form of <i>ha-yotze</i>.

For example, 5 squared is 25, 5 cubed is 125; 6 squared is 36, 6 cubed is 216, and so on (Meijler). Thus 5 and 6 are called round numbers because in effect, they orbit their root or make a circle and ultimately return to their root.</i> These four numbers<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">One, five, six, and ten.</i> therefore<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Because of their importance.</i> form the silent letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The letters <i>alef</i> (1); <i>heh</i> (5); <i>vav</i> (6), and <i>yod</i> (10).

THOU SHALT NOT HARDEN THY HEART. By refraining from addressing comforting words to him.
SHUT. <i>Tikpotz</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>kof, peh, tzadi</i>.</i> means you shall <i>shut</i>.

NEEDY. Some say that the word <i>evyon</i> (needy) is related to the word <i>avah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>alef, bet, heh</i>.</i> (would) in <i>and he would not</i> (Ex. 10:27), for <i>evyon</i> follows the paradigm <i>elyon, chevy on</i>, and <i>hegyon</i>, the roots of which are <i>ayin, lamed, heh; chet, bet, heh; heh, gimel, heh</i>. An <i>evyon</i> is so called because he desires everything because of his need.

Verse 8

BUT THOU SHALT SURELY OPEN THY HAND. <i>Pato’ach</i> (open) is an infinitive. Whenever Scripture omits the infinitive,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Which should accompany a verb. It does so here, for our text correctly reads, <i>pato’ach tiftach</i>.</i> it is employing an abridged style. The midrashic interpretation is also beautiful.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to the midrash the repetition of the verb in <i>pato’ach tiftach</i> (thou shalt surely open) indicates that one should open his hand to the poor even one hundred times. However, I.E. believes that the form <i>pato’ach tiftach</i> is the correct way to say you shall open.</i>
OPEN THY HAND TO HIM. To the one who has nothing.
AND SHALT SURELY LEND HIM. The meaning of <i>veha’avet tavitennu</i> (and shalt surely lend him) is, give him from yours by taking his pledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 4.</i> <i>Tavitennu</i> means take his pledge.

Verse 9

BASE. The word <i>beliya’al</i> (base) is a noun. Some say that <i>beliya’al</i> is a compound. It refers to a prayer that the vile person should not ascend, should not grow, and should not live.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beliya’al</i> is short for <i>beli ya’aleh</i> (without ascending). When one sees the wicked, one utters a curse to the effect that the wicked not ascend. The meaning of our verse is, may the wicked neither grow nor live.</i>
AND THINE EYE BE EVIL. <i>Ve-ra’ah</i> (and thine eye be evil) is similar to <i>ve-shavah</i> (and is returned) in <i>and is returned unto her father’s house</i> (Lev. 22:13). The word comes from a root two of whose letters are pronounced.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>ayin vav</i>. Its root is <i>resh, vav, ayin</i>.</i>

Verse 10

THAT. <i>Bi-gelal</i> (that) means the same as <i>sibbah</i> (because of). Compare, <i>sabbev</i> (cause) in <i>cause to change</i> (II Sam. 14:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is explaining the origin of the word <i>sibbah</i>.</i> For the All<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">God.</i> is in the parts,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In human beings, who are part of the whole.</i> that is, in the parts of the All, that is, the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Thus by being kind to his fellow human being, a person is being kind to God (Weiser). Other commentaries explain that the All refers to the community of Israel and the parts to each individual Jew. Now, since all of Israel forms one body, by helping another Jew one is helping oneself (Motot and Rabbi Yosef ben Eliezer tov Elem, followed by Krinsky, Netter, and others). See Book III of the Kuzari: “Plato calls…that which is expended on behalf of the law the portion of the whole. If, however, an individual neglects ‘the portion of the whole’…of which he forms a part, he sins against the commonwealth and more against himself; for the relation of the individual to the commonwealth is as the relation of the single limb to the body…” (Isaak Heinemann translation in <i>Three Jewish Philosophers</i>, N.Y., 1969, p. 99). In other words, the All is the nation, and the individual is a part of the nation. However, it should be noted that I.E. refers to God as the All. See I.E. on Gen. 1:26 (Vol. 1, p. 46), “God is one…He is all.” Also see I.E. on Gen. 18:21 (Vol. 1, p. 196) and Ex. 33:21 (Vol. 2, p. 695). The above-noted commentaries may have shied away from interpreting God as All here because of its pantheistic implications. It should be noted that when I.E. says that God is All, he does not intend to identify God with the world as the pantheists do. He means that God’s power and supervision hold the world together and give it continuous existence. Indeed, I.E. compares God’s relation to the world to that of speech to the speaker. As long as the speaker speaks, sounds are uttered. However, the speaker is not identified with the speech which he utters. On the other hand, I.E. was a contemporary of Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi and may be employing terminology similar to the one quoted above.</i>
THOU SHALT SURELY GIVE HIM. It means that if you give him, then God will add to your wealth.

Verse 14

THOU SHALT FURNISH HIM LIBERALLY. <i>Ha’anek ta’anik</i> (thou shalt furnish him liberally) means treat him gloriously. <i>Ta’anik</i> (thou shalt furnish him) is related to the word <i>anakim</i> (chains)<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Ornamental chains.</i> in <i>And chains about thy neck</i> (Prov. 1:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation, <i>ha’anek ta’anik</i> (thou shalt furnish him liberally) literally means thou shalt put ornament on him.

Verse 18

IT SHALL NOT SEEM HARD UNTO THEE. We find it written in Scripture, <i>three years, as the years of a hireling</i> (Is. 16:14).

The word <i>mishneh</i> in the latter is a noun. However, <i>mishneh</i> (next) in <i>mishneh la-melekh</i> (next unto king) (Esth. 10:3) is an adjective.” The words “the meaning of which <i>mishneh lamelekh</i> (double unto the king)” appear to be a gloss.

THE UNCLEAN AND THE CLEAN. The reference is to <i>may eat it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads, you shall eat it, the unclean and the clean. According to I.E. this is to be read as, the unclean and the clean you shall eat it. He interprets the <i>heh</i> prefaced to the Hebrew words for clean and unclean as a vocative <i>heh</i>. Thus <i>ha-tame</i> (the unclean) means you who are unclean, and <i>ha-tahor</i> (the clean) means you who are clean. The meaning of our clause thus is, you who are unclean and you who are clean shall eat of it.</i> Our verse is to be understood as a call: you, the clean and the unclean. Its meaning is, one is permitted to eat it whether one is clean or unclean. Scripture states this because one who is unclean and eats holy meat is punished with <i>karet</i> (excision).

Verse 1

Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition say that Passover<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The offering of the paschal lamb (Meijler).</i> is not to be observed if the first of the barley crop has not appeared.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>aviv</i> did not appear, then the paschal lamb was not offered that year.

II Chron. 35:7 states: <i>And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand</i>.</i> It similarly tells us that they gave (unto the Levite) <i>for the passover-offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>, v. 9). Scripture thus mentions the Passover offerings before it mentions the cattle.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that the oxen were not for the Passover offerings, for if they were they would have been so mentioned.</i> It similarly states, <i>thou and thy household</i> (Deut. 14:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, you are obligated to eat the tithe in the place of the sanctuary.

Verse 7

Verse 8

SIX DAYS. The ancients said six days from the lifting of the sickle.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">On the new crop.

Scripture prohibits eating of the new crop of grain before a measure (an omer) of new grain is cut and offered on the altar. Now, the Torah commands that matzot be eaten for seven days (v. 3). This contradicts our verse which states that matzot be eaten for six days. The Talmud (<i>Menachot</i> 66a) explains that our verse refers to matzot baked from the new crop, which could not be eaten before the second day of Passover, while the verse that tells the Israelites to eat matzot for seven days speaks of matzot made from grain from the previous year. See Rashi.</i> It is possible that <i>and on the seventh day</i> is connected to <i>six days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our text should read, Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and [so too] on the seventh day. In other words, you shall eat unleavened bread for seven days.</i> <i>And on the seventh day</i> was separated from the first half of the verse and placed in the second half of the verse because Scripture wanted to warn against doing work.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">On the seventh day. The point is <i>and on the seventh day</i> refers to both the first part of the verse and to the second. Our verse is to be understood as follows: <i>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread;</i> and [so too] on the seventh day; <i>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly …thou shalt do no work therein</i>.</i> Scripture does not say all manner of work.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">All manner of work is prohibited on the Sabbath and Yom Kippur. However, work necessary for the preparation of food is permitted on festivals.</i> The reason for the latter is that only servile work<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">All work except that which is necessary for the preparation of food. See Ex. 12:16.</i> is prohibited. Where Scripture does state all manner of work,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to a festival.</i> it reads, “Save” [that which every man must eat].<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 12:16.</i> When Scripture mentions that one is obligated to offer the Passover sacrifice in the glorious place, it also mentions the second festival (v. 9)<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The second pilgrimage festival, i.e., Shavu’ot.</i> and the third festival (v. 13).<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The third pilgrimage festival, i.e., Sukkot.</i> It does not mention the day of <i>shofar</i> sounding<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Ha-Shanah.</i> and the tenth day,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The tenth day of Tishri, i.e., Yom Kippur.</i> because the congregation does not gather then in the sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">On these days.

Verse 10

AFTER THE MEASURE. The <i>samekh</i> of <i>missat</i> (after the measure) receives a <i>dagesh</i> to compensate for the missing <i>nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Missat comes</i> from <i>the root nun, samekh, samekh</i>.</i> <i>Missat</i> is related to the word <i>nes</i> (banner). It means the lifting of the hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>missat nidvat yadekha</i> (after the measure of the freewill-offering of thy hand) means the lifting of the freewill-offering of thy hand. Scripture uses the term lifting when it deals with an offering to the sanctuary. Compare the word <i>trumah</i> (offering), which literally means a lifting.</i>
THE FREEWILL-OFFERING OF THY HAND. For burnt offerings and peace offerings.

Verse 11



Verse 12

AND THOU SHALT REMEMBER THAT THOU WAST A BONDMAN. This is connected to <i>thy man-servant and thy maid-servant</i> (v. 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">You shall be kind to your servants, for you were a slave in the land of Egypt.</i>

Verse 13

AFTER THAT THOU HAST GATHERED IN FROM THY THRESHING-FLOOR AND FROM THY WINEPRESS. Hence this festival is called <i>the feast of ingathering</i> (Ex. 34:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The festival of Sukkot is also referred to as the festival of ingathering.</i>

Verse 14



Verse 15

SHALT THOU KEEP A FEAST. <i>Tachog</i> (shalt thou keep a feast) means you shall sacrifice the offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the word <i>chag</i> not only means a holiday, it also refers to the sacrifice that is offered on the festival. See I.E. on Ex. 5:1 (Vol. 2, p. 115).</i> The reference is to the congregation.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The injunction, you shall sacrifice the offering, is directed to the congregation, for the congregation is obligated to bring the special offerings on the festivals (the <i>musaf</i> offerings).</i> On the other hand, it might refer to the individual. The Israelite is told to make burnt and peace offerings. <i>Shall bless thee</i> is proof of this. It means do this<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Sacrifice burnt and peace offerings</i> because God blessed you. Scripture adds <i>all thine increase</i> to explain that the object of <i>bless thee</i> is the produce which the earth will bring forth.
THE WORK OF THY HANDS. Trade and goods produced by craftsmen.
AND THOU SHALT BE ALTOGETHER JOYFUL. There is a commandment to be joyful on the festival of Sukkot.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>and thou shalt be…joyful</i> refers to the festival of Sukkot</i> Others say that it means that God will bless you in the future and you will always be happy.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>and thou shalt be…joyful</i> refers not only to the festival of Sukkot, it refers to the whole year.</i>
[ALTOGETHER.] The meaning of altogether is, you shall always be happy.

Verse 16

AND THEY SHALL NOT APPEAR…EMPTY. This is what Scripture means by <i>after the measure of the freewill-offering of thy hand</i> (v. 10).
BEFORE THE LORD. I have already explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 23:15 (Vol. 2, p. 501). I.E. there explains that <i>et pene Adonai</i> means before the Lord. <i>Et pene Adonai</i> literally means the face of God. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> 

Verse 17



Verse 18

[JUDGES.] Even though each and every commandment stands by itself there is, as it were, a midrashic reason for the connection of the sections.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The commandments.</i> The meaning <i>of Judges…</i>is, even though you are obligated to go three times a year to the place of the <i>kohanim</i> who serve in the sanctuary and there inquire regarding the statues and laws, it will not suffice. You must have judges in all of your cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, your gates. Hence the law of judges follows the law of the three pilgrimage festivals.</i>
OFFICERS. <i>Shoterim</i> (officers) means rulers. It is related to <i>shoter</i> (ruler) in <i>Overseer, or ruler</i> (Prov. 6:6) and similarly <i>mishtaro</i> (dominion thereof) in <i>the dominion thereof in the earth</i> (Job 38:33). The <i>shofetim</i> (judges) judge and the <i>shoterim</i> (officers) force the crooked [to obey the law].
IN ALL THY GATES. We find that Jehoshaphat<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">A king of Judah.</i> acted in this manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">See II Chron. 19:5.</i>
TRIBE BY TRIBE. In all the gates of each and every tribe.
AND THEY SHALL JUDGE. The reference is to the judges.

Verse 19

THOU SHALT NOT WREST JUDGMENT. Scripture speaks to each one of the judges.
THOU SHALT NOT RESPECT PERSONS. I have explained the word <i>takkir</i> (thou shalt respect) in my comments on <i>Ye shall not respect</i> (takkiru) <i>persons in judgment</i> (Deut. 1:17).

Verse 20

JUSTICE, JUSTICE. Moses speaks to the disputants. Moses repeats the word justice to indicate that one should pursue justice whether one gains or loses. Or the word is repeated to indicate that one should pursue justice as long as one exists;<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The repetition of the word connotes continuity.</i> or the word is repeated for emphasis.
THAT THOU MAYEST LIVE. Moses speaks to those who are entering the land.
AND INHERIT THE LAND. Moses speaks to their children. It means, you<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The children of those who inherit the land.</i> will keep this inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The Land of Israel.</i> The first thing that the judge has to be concerned with is widespread pagan practices such as the one referred to in <i>Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah</i> (v. 21).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Hence this law follows the one of appointing judges.</i> The Torah states the latter, for such is the practice of pagan worship, as <i>Behind one in the midst</i> (Is. 66:17)<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. in Isaiah renders this as, Behind one <i>asherah</i> in the midst of the garden. See I.E. on Is. 66:17.</i> shows.

Verse 21



Verse 22

NEITHER SHALT THOU SET THEE UP A PILLAR. For an idol, as <i>which the Lord thy God hateth</i> proves.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">God hates a pillar set up to an idol.</i> However, a pillar which is not set up for idol worship is permitted. The most convincing proof of this is found in the portion which opens with the words <i>And Jacob sent</i> (Gen. 32:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">There, Scripture (Gen. 35:14) relates that Jacob set up a pillar to God. Also see I.E. on Gen. 28:17, (Vol. 1, p. 279), where he writes that Scripture does not prohibit a pillar to honor God.</i>

Chapter 17



Verse 1

THOU SHALT NOT SACRIFICE UNTO THE LORD THY GOD. Look, when Moses mentions the <i>asherah</i> and the pillar he also mentions that it is prohibited to slaughter any blemished animal to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">That is, since Moses mentions that the <i>asherah</i> and the pillar are prohibited, he also mentions that it is prohibited to sacrifice any blemished animal to God, for these acts are an abomination to God.</i>
EVEN ANY EVIL THING. <i>Any evil thing</i> explains any blemish.
FOR THAT IS AN ABOMINATION. Its meaning is similar to <i>Present it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A blemished animal.</i> <i>now unto thy governor</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As a gift. Will he accept it? No, he will reject it and despise you for insulting him.</i> (Mal. 12:8). The one who offers it is punished. However, no punishment befalls one who does not sacrifice at all, unless he is obligated to bring an offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the Passover or sin offering.</i>

Verse 2

IF THERE BE FOUND IN THE MIDST OF THEE. After Moses mentions that one is prohibited to plant an <i>asherah</i> near an altar which is in public view, he backtracks and warns the individual not to worship idols.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In private.</i>
IN TRANSGRESSING HIS COVENANT. <i>La’avor brito</i> (in transgressing His covenant) is the reverse of keeping His covenant. I have previously explained grammatically the word <i>vayishtachu</i> (and worshipped), in the <i>Sefer Ha-Yesod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 23:7 (Vol. 1, p. 230) and Ex. 18:7 (Vol. 2, p. 351).</i>

Verse 3

OTHER GODS. Idols, the work of man.
OR THE SUN, OR THE MOON, OR ANY OF THE HOST OF HEAVEN. Which are the work of God.
WHICH I HAVE COMMANDED NOT. To serve them, even though they are My works.

Verse 4

THEN THOU SHALT INQUIRE DILIGENTLY. <i>Hetev</i> (diligently) means very much. Similarly <i>hetev</i> (greatly) in <i>Art thou greatly angry</i> (Jonah 4:9). It is a bit far-fetched to connect <i>hetev</i> to the word <i>tov</i> (good).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If we connect <i>hetev</i> to the word <i>tov</i> (good), the meaning of our clause is, then thou shalt inquire well.</i>

Verse 5

AND THOU SHALT STONE THEM. The man or the woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Who worshipped idols. <i>And thou shalt stone them</i> cannot refer to both of them, for Scripture speaks of a man or a woman.</i> It is similar to <i>they shall be burnt with fire</i>, <i>both he and they</i> (Lev. 20:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The verse speaks of a man who takes a mother and daughter, or a daughter and mother. <i>They shall be burnt with fire, both he and they</i> (ethen) can’t refer to both women, for what sin did the first woman commit? It is only the second woman taken who is put to death. If he first takes the mother, then it is the daughter who is put to death. If he first takes the daughter, then it is the mother who is put to death. The meaning of <i>ethen</i> (they) thus is, one of them.</i> Since Scripture says, <i>and it be told thee</i> (v. 4) in secret,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s elaboration of the verse.</i> and <i>thou hear it</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>) in public,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s elaboration of the verse.</i> it had to explain that even though it was told to you, and you heard, they shall not be put to death except upon the testimony of two witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The law of witnesses follows the law of idolatry because the punishment of idolaters requires two witnesses to the act of idol worship.</i>

Verse 6

OR THREE WITNESSES. Who accept the testimony of two witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Gaon two witnesses may testify before three witnesses. The latter may then testify as to what they heard. However, two witnesses cannot testify before two other witnesses. Thus according to the Gaon our verse should be read as follows: at the mouth of two witnesses who saw the event that they are testifying to, or at the mouth of three witnesses who heard it from two witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death. The Gaon so interpreted our verse because he wanted to avoid the question, “If two witnesses are enough to convict a person, why does Scripture go on to say or <i>three witnesses</i>?”</i> So says the Gaon.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> Look, the Torah does not state whether we accept the testimony of relatives or of a woman or the testimony of an enemy of the deceased.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">We must rely on tradition in these instances. I.E. comments thus because he will soon say that we must rely on tradition regarding the understanding of our verse.</i> Some say that if two witnesses contradict two witnesses, then a third witnesses determines innocence or guilt.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture reads, <i>At the mouth of two…or three witnesses shall he…be put to death</i>.</i> Others say two witnesses from among the wise men and three from the others.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Non-scholars.</i> We are thus forced to rely on the words of tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In understanding our verse, as we must with regard to the testimony of relatives, or of a woman, or the testimony of an enemy of the deceased. According to the rabbis the meaning of <i>At the mouth of two…or three witnesses</i> is, just as two witnesses form one unit, so do three witnesses form one unit, and if one of the three is disqualified the entire unit is disqualified.</i>

Verse 7

THE HAND<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>yad</i>.</i> OF THE WITNESSES.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>edim</i>.</i> The hand of each one of the witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yad</i> is the singular. <i>Edim</i> is in the plural.

SO THOU SHALT PUT AWAY. I have previously explained the meaning of <i>u-vi’arta</i> (so thou shalt put away).

Verse 8

IF THERE ARISE A MATTER TOO HARD FOR THEE. Moses speaks to the judges. This follows the previous law because two witnesses are required in order to execute a person. The meaning of <i>between blood and blood</i> is, between innocent blood and guilty blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the previous verse deals with executing a culprit. Our verse tells us what the judge is to do if he cannot determine whether the accused is guilty or not.</i> 
The word <i>yippale</i> (too hard) is similar to the word <i>hayippale</i> (is anything too hard) (Gen. 18:14). I have explained it there.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 18:14 (Vol. 1, p. 195).</i>
BETWEEN PLEA AND PLEA. With regard to money.
AND BETWEEN STROKE AND STROKE.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ben nega la-nega</i>. Literally, between plague and plague. See Rashi.</i> Such as wounds and bruises.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>nega</i> here does not have its usual meaning of plague, but rather means a wound.</i> <i>Even matters of controversy</i> is a general term.
THEN THOU SHALT ARISE, AND GET THEE UP. I have explained this before.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 16:12 (Vol. 4, p. 130).</i>

THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES. For, as I have explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s commentary on Gen. 14:18 (Vol. 1, p. 167) and his Short Commentary on Ex. 19:6.

Cf. <i>And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests</i> (Ex. 19:6).</i>
AND UNTO THE JUDGE. The reference is to the king who writes a copy of the Torah from the one which is in the hands of the <i>kohanim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 18.</i>
AND UNTO THE JUDGE. In the place where he is.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The judge is not necessarily near the sanctuary.</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11

ACCORDING TO THE LAW WHICH THEY SHALL TEACH THEE. With regard to the matter that is too hard for you.

Verse 12

EVEN THAT MAN SHALL DIE. The court shall put him to death. The reason for the latter is so that <i>the people shall hear, and fear</i> (v. 13). When Moses mentions the judge, he explains the laws that the judge must keep.

Verse 15

THOU SHALT IN ANY WISE SET HIM KING OVER THEE. This is optional.

WHO IS NOT THY BROTHER. Who is not of the family of Israel, and also one who is an Edomite even though Scripture refers to Edomites as “your brother.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 23:8.</i> Now in those days horses were brought from Egypt. Scripture’s words concerning Solomon, <i>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt</i> (I Kings 10:29), is proof of this. The king would thus cause Israel to sin if he wanted to multiply his horses, for he would cause the people to return to Egypt. This is clearly so:<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that multiplying horses would entail going down to Egypt.</i> God took Israel out of Egypt, and by going back they would desecrate God’s name.

YE SHALL HENCEFORTH RETURN NO MORE. This was a commandment that was not written down.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>As the Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more</i> [to Egypt].

However, the latter has a different meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">It is a prophecy, not a command.</i>

Verse 17

THAT HIS HEART TURN NOT AWAY. For he will go after his lusts.
NEITHER SHALL HE GREATLY MULTIPLY TO HIMSELF SILVER AND GOLD. So that he does not punish<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">That is, oppress.</i> Israel. Now Israel complained about Solomon who, because of his great love of money, <i>made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones</i> (I Kings 10:27).

BESIDE THAT WHICH IS HIS DUE.

ANYONE THAT USETH DIVINATION.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>kosem kesamim</i>.</i> <i>Kosem</i> (one that useth divination) is most probably a general term.

Thus <i>gazerin</i> means those who decree.</i> The word <i>kesem</i> (divine sentence) in <i>A divine sentence is in the lips of the king</i> (Prov. 16:10) is close in meaning to it. The particulars<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Following the general term <i>kesamim</i>.</i> are a <i>soothsayer</i> (me’onen), <i>or an enchanter</i> (menachesh), <i>or a sorcerer</i> (mechashef). It is also possible that <i>kosem</i> is a specific term for astrologers<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The term used by I.E. is <i>hovere shamayim</i>. This is a phrase found in Is. 47:13. I.E. there defines it as astrologers. I.E. believed that the study of astrology was permitted. What was prohibited was making absolute predictions using astrology. It should be noted that I.E. believed that the <i>urim</i> and <i>tummim</i> entailed the use of astrology. Therefore I.E. probably believed that certain types of astrological predictions were prohibited, while others, i.e., those sanctioned by the Torah, were permitted. See I.E. on Ex. 28:5 (Vol. 2, pp. 595-598? and the notes thereto). See also Dov.

All of these things<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in verses 10,11.</i> are abominations to God. The truth is that a person must fully believe in his creator in his heart. When a person relies on his wisdom, and not on God, in seeking the truth and what will be in the future, his mind is deficient, for it is perverted. The person who wants to inquire,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">As to what the future holds.</i> let him inquire from God via a prophet. Scripture therefore afterward reads, <i>A prophet will the Lord…raise up…from the midst of thee</i> (v. 15). The latter refers to Joshua. <i>Unto him ye shall hearken</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>), which is later followed by <i>and the children of Israel hearkened unto him</i> (Deut. 34:9), is proof of this.

Verse 4



Verse 5

HIS NEIGHBOR. <i>Et re’ehu</i> means with his neighbor. There are many such cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Where <i>et</i> has the meaning of <i>im</i>. See Ex. 1:1.</i>
FETCHETH A STROKE. <i>Ve-niddechah</i> (fetcheth a stroke) is a <i>nifal. Nidche</i> (the dispersed of) in <i>He gathereth together the dispersed of Israel</i> (Ps. 147:2) is the <i>kal</i> form.
WITH THE AXE. <i>Garzen</i> (axe) refers to a metal instrument used to cut a tree down. It is related to the word <i>nigzarti</i> (I was cut off).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Ps. 31:23. The reading there is <i>nigrazti</i>. However, I.E. believes that <i>nigrazti</i> and <i>nigzarti</i> are one and the same word, with the letters inverted. See I.E. on Ps. 31:23.</i>
AND THE HEAD SLIPPETH FROM THE HELVE. <i>Venashal</i> (slippeth) is similar to <i>ve-nasa</i> (shall set forward) (Num. 2:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Both words are intransitive and are similarly vocalized.</i> It is related to the word <i>yishal</i> (shall drop off) in <i>for thine olives shall drop off</i> (Deut. 28:40). The word <i>ve-nashal</i> (and shall cast) in <i>and shall cast out many nations</i> (Deut. 7:1) is transitive. However, <i>ve-nashal</i> (slippeth) in our verse is intransitive. According to a great grammarian the same is true of the word <i>yasaf</i> (more) in <i>with a great voice, and it went on no more</i> (Deut. 5:19) and <i>yasaf</i> (added) in <i>For the Lord hath added sorrow</i> (Jer. 45:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yasaf</i> is intransitive in Deut. 5:19 and intransitive in Jer. 45:3.</i> However, I believe that they are both transitive.

Verse 6

AND SMITE HIM MORTALLY. <i>Ve-hikkahu nefesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and smite him life.

This appears to contradict I.E.’s first statement that the reference is to all the laws of the Torah.

Verse 14

THOU SHALT NOT REMOVE THY NEIGHBOUR’S LANDMARKS. The meaning of <i>tassig</i> (thou shalt…remove) is known.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">From its context (Weiser).</i> Its meaning is similar to the word <i>tasseg</i> (remove) in <i>Remove not the ancient landmark</i> (Prov. 22:28).

WHICH THEY OF OLD TIME HAVE SET. The ones who divided up the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">When Israel first entered the Land of Israel. See Josh. 19:51.</i>

ONE WITNESS SHALL NOT RISE UP. This section<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The section dealing with witnesses (verses 15-21).</i> follows,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It follows the section dealing with the removal of boundaries.</i> because destroying the boundary markers<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> leads to quarrels, blows, and murder. Scripture therefore goes on to state, following this, <i>Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth</i> (v. 21). The one who claims that his neighbor removed his landmark must bring witnesses. Hence, Scripture reads, <i>one witness shall not rise up</i>, which means that two witnesses are required in cases involving murder, assault, landmark removal, or any matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">It does not apply only to boundary disputes which precede it.</i> S<i>hene edim</i> (two witnesses) is an abridged phrase,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>sheni</i> is short for <i>shenaim</i>.</i> for Scripture elsewhere reads, <i>shenayim edim</i> (two witnesses) (Deut. 17:6).

Verse 16

TO BEAR PERVERTED WITNESS AGAINST HIM. Such as accusing him of idol worship.

Chapter 20



Verse 1

WHEN THOU GOEST FORTH TO BATTLE. This is connected to <i>And thine eye shall not pity</i> (Deut. 19:21), for one is not to have pity.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">On the guilty or on the one who is obligated to go into battle.</i> However, when going forth to war you should pity<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">And exempt from battle.</i> the man who has betrothed a woman, or built a house, or planted a vineyard, or one whose heart is faint.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 5.</i>

NEITHER BE YE AFFRIGHTED. In deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">When engaged in combat.</i>

Verse 4



Verse 5

DEDICATED IT. <i>Chanakho</i> (dedicated it) is similar to the word <i>chanukkat</i> (dedication of) in <i>the dedication offer of the altar</i> (Num. 7:10). The word <i>chanokh</i> (train) in <i>Train up a child</i> (Prov. 22:6) is similar. Our rabbis, of blessed memory, learned from the latter that we train (<i>mekhannechin</i>) children. The reason that [one who has not dedicated his house is released from service] is that such a man’s heart and desire is to dedicate his house. Look, his mind will be upon his house, not on the battle. He will therefore flee and cause others to flee.

Verse 6

USED THE FRUIT THEREOF. The word <i>chillelo</i> (used the fruit thereof) is connected to the word <i>challilim</i> (flutes), for they were in the habit of dancing<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When the harvest was concluded.</i> in the vineyards<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To the accompaniment of flutes.</i> (Jud. 21:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. we should render our clause, and did not play music over it; i.e., he did not harvest his vineyard.</i>

Verse 7

AND WHAT MAN IS THERE THAT HATH BETROTHED A WIFE, AND HATH NOT TAKEN HER? In marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Brought her into his house. There were two stages to marriage in ancient Israel, <i>erusin</i> (betrothal) and <i>nesu’in</i> (marriage). In the first stage the woman, though married, still lived in her father’s house. In the second stage she went to live with her husband. The marriage was not consummated till the second stage.</i> Look, this verse is a sign that there are people who die when their time comes.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the man who has married a woman but has not consummated the marriage is exempt from the army because his time to die has probably not yet come. He will therefore be able to consummate his marriage if he does not go forth to war.</i> However, the one who dies in battle dies before his time. Hence David said, <i>or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away</i> (I Sam. 26:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The entire clause reads: <i>or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away</i>.</i>

Verse 8

THAT IS FEARFUL. To strike another person.
AND FAINT-HEARTED. To suffer someone’s blow.
HIS BRETHREN’S HEART. Look, the word <i>et</i> appears superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>ve-lo yimmas et levav echav</i> (lest brethren’s heart melt). The particle <i>et</i> usually connects an active verb with the object. However, <i>yimmas</i> is in the <i>nifal</i>; it is passive. Hence the particle <i>et</i> appears to be superfluous.</i> However, its meaning is as I have previously explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>et</i> does not always connect an active verb with the direct object. See I.E. on Ex. 10:8 (Vol. 2, pp. 187,188).</i> It indicates the thing itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is used to emphasize the word which follows in this case <i>lev</i> (heart).</i>

Verse 9

SHALL BE APPOINTED. <i>U-fakedu</i> (shall be appointed) is related to the word <i>pekod</i> (appoint).

Verse 10

THEN PROCLAIM PEACE UNTO IT. The meaning of <i>ve-karata</i> is proclaim unto it.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-karata</i> is an imperative.</i> This is a commandment, or it is most likely an option.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, <i>ve-karata</i> is to be rendered, you may call unto her.</i>

Verse 16

THOU SHALT SAVE ALIVE NOTHING. It is forbidden to give them food or drink. The general rule is that they were to kill them if possible. The latter applied to their days.

Verse 19

FOR IS THE TREE OF THE FIELD MAN.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ki ha-adam etz ha-sadeh</i>. The latter literally means for man is a tree of the field. This, as I.E. goes on to say, does not make sense. Hence the interpretations which follow.</i> I have previously explained in the <i>Sefer Ha-Yesod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A Hebrew grammar composed by I.E. The book survives only in fragments.</i> that it is possible in all languages to be brief and to apply an abbreviated style, as in “an ass bread”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (I Sam. 16:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">An ass bread is short for <i>an ass laden with bread</i>.</i> However, it is impossible to leave out the word <i>lo</i> (no, not),<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">If one wants to employ an abbreviated style.</i> for in this case the meaning would be reversed.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>ki ha-adam etz ha-sadeh</i> as if written <i>ki ha-adam lo etz ha-sadeh</i> (for the tree of the field is not a man). In other words, Onkelos claims that the word <i>lo</i> has been left out of the verse. I.E. disagrees. Hence his comment.</i> A great Spanish grammarian<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. does not identify the grammarian.</i> said that a <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">An interrogative <i>heh</i>.</i> has been omitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">From the word <i>ki</i> in <i>ki ha-adam etz ha-sadeh</i>.</i> Our clause should be interpreted as if written, <i>hakhi adam etz ha-sadeh</i> (for is the tree of the field man).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>ki ha-adam etz ha-sadeh</i>. The latter literally means for man is a tree of the field. Hence the unnamed grammarian’s interpretation.</i> Now this interpretation does not appear correct to me. Why would Scripture say that you shall not destroy fruit trees, because, unlike a human being, they cannot run away from you?<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of our verse if we render <i>ha-khi adam etz ha-sadeh</i> as, for is the tree of the field man.</i> I believe there is no need for all this.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">To interpret <i>ki ha-adam etz ha-sadeh</i> as if written <i>ha-khi adam etz ha-sadeh</i>.</i> The following is the meaning of our clause. For thou mayest eat of them, but thou shalt not cut them down, for the tree of the field is man; that is, the life of man is supported by trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ki ha-adam</i> (for man) is short for <i>ki chayye ha-adam</i> (for the life of man).</i> Compare, <i>For he taketh a life to pledge</i> (Deut. 24:6), which is short for, for he taketh that which sustains man’s life to pledge.
BUT THOU SHALT NOT CUT THEM DOWN. This is connected to <i>that it should he besieged of thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, you shall not cut down the fruit trees to use their wood to build siege works.</i> Look, do not destroy a fruit tree, which is a source of sustenance for human life. Be that as it may, you are permitted to eat of it but you are prohibited from destroying it so that the city will be besieged because of you. The fact that Scripture then states <i>thou mayest destroy and cut down</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The trees that do not produce fruit.</i> <i>that thou mayest build bulwarks</i> (v. 20), is proof of this.

Verse 20

Verse 3

A HEIFER OF THE HERD, WHICH HATH NOT BEEN WROUGHT WITH. Never used for plowing.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The heifer was not tied to a plow. The Hebrew reads <i>lo ubbad bah</i> (which hath not been wrought with). I.E. interprets <i>ubbad</i> as referring to plowing, for Scripture later uses a word from this root in the sense of ploughed. Compare, <i>lo ye’aved bo</i> (which may neither be plowed) (v. 4).</i>
AND WHICH HATH NOT DRAWN IN THE YOKE. To bring stones, as is the practice with heifers.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They are used for pulling wagons.</i>

Verse 4

ROUGH. The word <i>etan</i> (rough) means mighty.
AND SHALL BREAK…THE NECK. <i>Ve-arefu</i> (and they shall break) means they shall remove the back of the neck of the heifer.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they shall decapitate it. <i>Oref</i> means back of the neck. <i>Ve-arefu</i> literally means they shall neck it.

Verse 6

AND ALL THE ELDERS OF THAT CITY. The elders referred to in <i>then thy elders…shall come forth</i> (v. 2). 

Verse 7

[SHED.] The <i>heh</i> in <i>shafekhu</i> (shed) indicates the plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>vav</i> is usually used to indicate the third person plural perfect. In our verse a <i>heh</i> is used in place of the <i>vav</i>.</i> It is like the <i>heh</i> in <i>shafekhu ashurai</i> (my steps slipped) (Ps. 73:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Here too the word <i>shafekhu</i> is spelled with a <i>heh</i> in place of a <i>vav</i>.</i> However, interpreting it midrashically, the <i>heh</i> refers to each one of the hands, for the word <i>yad</i> (hand) is in most cases feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If we ignore the vowels, then our word reads <i>shafekhah. Shafekhah</i> is the third person perfect feminine. In this case our verse reads: <i>yadenu shafekhah</i> (our hands it has spilled). According to I.E. a combination of the plural with the singular refers to each one of the plural. See I.E. on Gen. 49:22 (Vol. 1, p. 441).</i>
NEITHER HAVE OUR EYES SEEN IT. It is possible that God commanded the city closest to the slain to perform this<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ritual.</i> because if the city had not committed a similar deed, then the murder of a person near their city would not have occurred.

AND THEY SHALL SPEAK AND SAY. <i>Ve-anu ve-ameru</i> (and they shall speak and say) is similar to <i>ve-anita ve-amarta</i> (and thou shalt speak and say) (Deut. 26:5). I will explain it there.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 26:5.</i>

SHALL BE FORGIVEN. A <i>tav</i> has been omitted in the word <i>ve-nikapper</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The word should have read <i>ve-nitkapper</i>.</i> (shall be forgiven). It is similar to the word <i>venivasseru</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The word should have read <i>ue-nitvassseru</i>.</i> (may be taught) in <i>that all women may be taught</i> (Ezek. 23:48). They<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-nikapper</i> and <i>ve-nivasseru</i>.</i> are a combination of two forms, the <i>nifal</i> and the <i>hitpa’el</i>. 
Scripture mentions <i>whom thou hast redeemed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The question is, why add this appellation to Israel? The Bible does not usually describe Israel in this manner.</i> to indicate that as You redeemed Israel from Egypt as a manifestation of Your great mercies, similarly redeem them from this blood and the punishment for its shedding.

Verse 9

SO SHALT THOU PUT AWAY THE INNOCENT BLOOD. The meaning of <i>the innocent blood</i> is, the punishment for the shedding of the innocent blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>So shalt thou put away the innocent blood</i> (ha-dam hanaki) <i>from the midst of thee</i>. The question arises, “What does this clause mean?” The innocent blood has already been shed, i.e., put away. Hence I.E. points out that <i>ha-dam ha-naki</i> is short for <i>onesh ha-dam ha-naki</i> (the punishment for the innocent blood), and our verse teaches that by performing this ritual you remove from your midst the punishment for the shedding of innocent blood. See Meijler.</i> On the other hand, the word <i>ha-dam ha-naki</i> (the innocent blood) is short for <i>ha-dam, dam ha-naki</i> (the blood, the innocent blood).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to Meijler our verse is interpreted as if written <i>shofekh hadam, dam ha-naki</i>, the spiller of innocent blood. That is, if after the ritual is performed the murderer is discovered, you shall put away the shedder of blood, of innocent blood.</i> Some say that the meaning of <i>so shalt thou put away the innocent blood</i> is, you must eradicate the shedding of blood. However, in my opinion, and I have mentioned this before, it means no innocent blood will be shed in your land if you do what is right in the eyes of God. The latter is in keeping with the secret that the reward of sin is sin, and the reward of a commandment is the commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 2:1. If innocent blood was shed near the city it was because the people of the city committed a similar crime. Thus the wages of sin is more sin.</i>

Verse 10

WHEN THOU GOEST FORTH TO BATTLE. This section is connected with <i>When thou shalt besiege a city</i> (Deut. 20:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Both deal with war.</i> The section dealing with the decapitated heifer<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 1-9.</i> was inserted between them because it deals with a slain person found in the Land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">When one goes to war he encounters slain people. There is thus a thematic connection between the sections.</i> This law does not apply outside of the Land of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">For verse 1 explicitly states, <i>in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee</i>.</i> and certainly not in time of war.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In the Land of Israel. Thus Scripture contrasts the law regarding finding a slain person in time of peace and finding one in time of war.</i>

Verse 11

A WOMAN. The rabbis have already explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis tell us that the law also applies to married women. See <i>Sifre</i> on this verse.</i>
OF GOODLY FORM. In his own eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the law applies even in cases where most people would consider the captive woman unattractive. See <i>Sifre</i> on this verse.</i>
AND THOU HAST A DESIRE UNTO HER. You will desire to take her for a wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads: and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee for a woman (<i>le-ishah</i>). “Wouldest take her to thee for a woman” might mean that the Israelite merely wants to have sex with her. Hence I.E.’s comment that the intention is to marry her.</i> for after this Scripture states, <i>and be her husband. So I took her to be my wife</i> (le-ishah) (Gen. 12:19) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">That I took her to be my woman means I took her to be my wife.</i>

Verse 12

THEN THOU SHALT BRING HER HOME TO THY HOUSE; AND SHE SHALL SHAVE HER HEAD. Some say that she shaves her head as he may have desired her because of her hair.
PARE. <i>Ve-asetah et tzipparneha</i> (and pare her nails) means she shall let her nails grow long so that she will appear disgusting in his eyes.

Verse 13

AND SHE SHALL PUT THE RAIMENT OF HER CAPTIVITY FROM OFF HER. For he may have desired her because of her beautiful garments.
AND BEWAIL. So that he is no longer happy with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">So that he no longer enjoys her company, for she is morose.</i>
A FULL MONTH. Perhaps his desire will cool. Others say:<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">What follows is an alternate interpretation of verses 12 and 13. It may be a later insertion into the commentary by I.E., for he repeats the verse. It should be noted that a similar phenomenon appears at the end of his comments on Ex. 20:14 and in his comments on Ex. 34:6.</i> SHE SHALL SHAVE HER HEAD. Because she is unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Ritually unclean.</i> The law regarding the leper is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The leper shaves his head when undergoing purification. See Lev. 14:8,9.</i>
AND PARE. <i>Ve-asetah</i> (and pare)<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and do.</i> means and fix. Its fixing consists in cutting off the excess.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The part of the nail that is longer than usual.</i> Compare, <i>asah</i> (trimmed)<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, did.</i> in <i>nor trimmed his heard</i> (II Sam. 19:25) and in <i>And instead of curled hair</i> (ma’aseh<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the work of.</i> miksheh) <i>baldness</i> (Is. 3:24). The main meaning of the word <i>ma’aseh</i> (work) in Scripture is fixing,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 2:4 and the notes thereto (Vol. 1, p. 51).</i> except for instances when something unseemly follows.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, <i>la’asot ha-ra</i> (in doing that which was evil) (Deut. 9:18).</i> However, even in the latter instance the reference might be to complete an evil deed.
AND SHE SHALL PUT THE RAIMENT OF HER CAPTIVITY FROM OFF HER. For it is filthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Her garments are most probably soiled. This interpretation, unlike the previous one, does not believe that he removes her garments of captivity because they were the cause of her captor’s desire for her.</i>
AND SHALL REMAIN IN THY HOUSE, AND BE WAIL…A FULL MONTH. This means she shall remain in your house a month to cry.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For her father and her mother.</i>
HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER. If close by.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">If her parents were recently killed, that is, if they were killed in the war. Weiser believes that the reference is to her parents’ residence. If the place of their residence is close by, then the captive woman can ascertain the fate of her parents. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, if he (her captor) killed them.</i> Some say that she bewails her father and mother because they did not convert to Judaism.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In this case she bewails her parents even they are still alive.</i> However, I believe that reason teaches us that every person is obligated to honor his father and his mother while they live and also after their deaths. 
The meaning of <i>and bewail…</i> is, she shall mourn her parents if they were killed while she was taken captive in the same manner that an Israelite women mourns, for she is converting to Judaism. Scripture had no need to mention that she shall bathe,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In a <i>mikveh</i>, a pool of water which purifies the impure. All converts have to immerse themselves in a <i>mikveh</i>.</i> for it is necessary for her to be purified by the waters of sprinkling,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>me niddah</i>. According to Rabbinic interpretation the reference is to a <i>mikveh</i>.</i> as Scripture earlier states, <i>ye and your captives</i> (Num. 31:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Shall purify yourselves in the “waters of sprinkling.”</i>
[AND AFTER THAT THOU MAYEST GO INTO HER, AND BE HER HUSBAND.] Our rabbis, of blessed memory, said that he has to wait three months.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Before marrying the captive woman, in order to ascertain the paternity of the child that she might be carrying. See <i>Sifre</i> on this verse.</i> Even though the words of our sages need no support<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">That it takes three months before one is certain as to whether or not a woman is pregnant.</i> I offer the following <i>as</i> proof, <i>And it came to pass about three months after</i> (Gen. 38:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Three months after Tamar had intercourse with Judah her pregnancy first became evident.</i> The latter is the time when the fetus begins to move. It is prohibited to have sexual relations with a women when one is in doubt as to whether she is pregnant or not, because of the uncertain paternity of the fetus; for some women give birth two months short of the normal term.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if a woman gives birth after nine months and had intercourse with one man nine months ago, and intercourse with another man seven months ago, we do not know whether she carried for nine months and the first man is the father, or she had the child prematurely and the second man is the father.</i> Others give birth later than the normal term.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">At 11 months it is thus possible for the captor to wait three months before taking the captive woman and for the latter to have a child 8 months later without the captor being the husband. This being the case, why did the rabbis say that the captor has to wait three months? They should have said that he should wait four months.</i> However, the latter rarely occurs.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis were not concerned with what occurs rarely.</i>
A FULL MONTH. <i>Yerach yamim</i> (a full month) is similar to <i>chodesh yamim</i> (a whole month) (Num. 11:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Both terms mean a full month.</i> I have explained this previously.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>chodesh yamim</i>. See I.E. on Gen. 4:4 (Vol. 1, p. 81). According to I.E., <i>chodesh yamim</i> refers to a complete cycle of the month.</i> A month is called a <i>yerach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yerach</i> means a moon.</i> because the moon is its basis.

Verse 14

THEN THOU SHALT LET HER GO.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-shilachta le-nafshah</i>.</i> You shall do to her as she desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes the word <i>nafshah</i> to mean her desire. He interprets <i>veshilachta le-nafshah</i> as you shall allow her to do whatever she wants.</i>
BUT THOU SHALT NOT SELL HER AT ALL FOR MONEY. Scripture speaks of what is widely practiced.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Most take money when they transact a sale.</i> Its true meaning is, do not sell her.
THOU SHALT NOT DEAL WITH HER AS WITH A SLAVE. The word <i>titammer</i> (deal as with a slave) is similar to the word <i>ve-hitammer</i> (and he deal as with a slave) in <i>and he deal with him as a slave</i> (Deut. 24:7). The word is not found a third time.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">It is found only twice in Scripture.</i> The meaning of the word has to be ascertained from its context. It means deceitfully.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. our clause reads, thou shalt not deal with her deceitfully, and Deut. 24:7 as, <i>and he deal with him</i> deceitfully.</i>

Verse 15

BELOVED. In his eyes, not in the eyes of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Contra the Rabbinic interpretation. According to the Talmud, “hated” means hated by God, i.e., taken in a marriage which God hates, that is, in a prohibited marriage (such as a <i>kohen</i> marrying a divorced woman). See <i>Yevamot</i> 23a.</i>
THAT WAS HATED. <i>Seni’ah</i> (hated) is an adjective. This section follows<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The section dealing with a captive woman.</i> because the preceding section<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 1-14.</i> reads, <i>and thou hast a desire unto her</i> (v. 11)<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">This section speaks of a woman who is beloved.</i> <i>and…if thou have no delight in her</i> (v. 14).<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Our chapter speaks of a woman who is not beloved.</i>

Verse 17

HE SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE. He shall acknowledge him by an act,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">He shall treat him as a first-born.</i> or he shall admit before others who the firstborn is, if the first-born is in a place where he is unknown, or he is obligated right at the beginning to acknowledge which one of his sons is the first-born should they be twins.
BY GIVING HIM A DOUBLE PORTION. The first-born shall take two parts. If there are three sons let them imagine that there are four and the first-born shall take two parts. If there are two sons let them imagine that there are three, and so in all cases. In my opinion this too is the meaning of <i>I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me</i> (II Kings 2:9), as I explained in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">We no longer have I.E.’s commentary on Kings.</i>
FOR HE IS THE FIRST-FRUITS OF HIS STRENGTH. The one known as first-born.

Verse 18

STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS. Towards God and towards the parents if they be God-fearing.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">One does not have to follow the dictates of ungodly parents.</i>
STUBBORN. The word <i>soreh</i> (stubborn) is similar to the word <i>sorre’ah</i> (stubborn) in <i>like a stubborn heifer</i> (Hos. 4:16). He does not keep the positive commandments.
AND REBELLIOUS. With regard to the negative commandments.
AND THOUGH THEY CHASTEN HIM. In the presence of witnesses. The parents are commanded to take hold of him and bring him [to the elders]. The words of tradition are true.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud the law of the rebellious son applies only to one who has parents.</i> 

Verse 19



Verse 20

HE IS A GLUTTON. The meaning of <i>zolel</i> (glutton) is explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 23:20 speaks of <i>zolele basar</i>.</i> It refers to one who gluttonously devours meat. However, the term refers to anyone who commits himself to all that he lusts for, to all that his desires ask of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Prov. 23:20 speaks of being gluttonous in regard to meat.</i>
AND A DRUNKARD. <i>Sove</i> refers to one who drinks a lot. It refers to a drunkard. This individual is essentially a heretic.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The term used by I.E. is <i>apikores</i>.</i> He desires life in this world only for eating and drinking. This portion<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The portion dealing with the rebellious son.</i> was placed here because of the <i>woman of goodly form</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The captive woman.</i> <i>And his</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The man who cursed God.</i> <i>mother’s name was Shelomith</i><sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Shelomith fornicated with an Egyptian.

Verse 21



Verse 22

AND THOU HANG HIM. We have received from the rabbis, of blessed memory, traditions regarding those who are hanged.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Which culprits are to be hanged. Rabbi Eliezer believes that all those who are executed by stoning are then hanged for display. The sages limit this punishment only to those who are hanged for cursing God.</i>

Verse 23

FOR HE THAT IS HANGED IS A REPROACH UNTO GOD.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ki killelat Elohim taluy</i>.</i> For he cursed God.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">This intrerpretation renders <i>ki killelat Elohim taluy</i> as, he is hanged (<i>taluy</i>) for cursing God (<i>ki killelat Elohim</i>). When people see his body they are reminded that God was cursed. The latter is a reproach to God.</i> However, according to the plain meaning of the text, God is the subject.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">And he that is hanged the object.</i> The curse comes to all places close to the hanged.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>ki killelat taluy</i> as for God curses the hanged. He interprets this as meaning God curses those who are near a hanged person.</i> It<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">This law.</i> has a secret connected to the soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The area infects the soul. I.E. probably meant that the sight of a hanged person and its putrefying smell affect a person’s psyche and prevent him from concentrating on philosophical and religious studies.</i> Scripture therefore goes on to say, <i>that thou defile not thy land</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">By leaving a putrefying body exposed.</i> This section follows because of the war,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Dealt with in verses 10-15.</i> for Scripture first states, <i>When thou goest forth to battle</i> (Deut. 20:1). Now the incident at Gibeon<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">In the war at Gibeon Joshua captured five Canaanite kings and hanged them. He removed their bodies before nightfall. He did not do this out of respect for the deceased, for according to Canaanite practice there was nothing wrong in allowing the bodies to rot in public. Hence he did this out of respect for the land. See Josh. 10:26,27.</i> shows that the purpose of the law which says that his body shall not remain upon the tree all night is not out of respect for the deceased but rather out of respect for the land,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">That it not be defiled.</i> for the law of the Canaanites and the law of the Israelites differ.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">The Gibeonites did not allow burial of the sons of Saul whom they hanged. Their bodies remained on the tree for months. See II Sam. 21:1-14. So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 and other manuscripts. Some printed editions read: for the law of the uncircumcised and the law of the Israelites are the same. According to this reading Israel did not allow non-Jews to remain hanging on the tree because the Israelites respected Canaanite practice. The <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 version is to be preferred for many reasons.</i>

Chapter 22



Verse 1

THOU SHALT NOT SEE THY BROTHER’S OX. Even when you go out to war.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The law concerning a lost object was placed in the Torah portion <i>When Thou Goest Forth to Battle</i> to teach us that this law applies even in time of war.</i> This is midrashic. 
AND HIDE THYSELF. This is connected to <i>Thou shalt not</i> see.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of our verse is, thou shalt not see <i>and hide thyself</i>.</i> Scripture mentions the ox and the sheep (v. 1). The ass was previously mentioned (Ex. 23:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Where Scripture first mentions the law dealing with a lost animal. I.E. was disturbed by the omission of ass in verse 1. Hence his Exodus citation.</i> The same law applies to all beasts.

Verse 2

THEN THOU SHALT BRING IT HOME.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This superscription from verse 2 was probably inadvertently misplaced by a copyist because it seems to belong after I.E.’s comment’s on verse 1.</i> If you are coming back<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If you find the lost animal on your way back from the war.</i> or you command someone; that is, you give it to an honest person for safekeeping. <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When you go off to war you ask someone else to bring the animal home.</i>

Verse 3

THOU MAYEST NOT. <i>Lo tukhal</i> (thou mayest not)<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, you will not be able.</i> is to be understood like its counterparts.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It (<i>lo tukhal</i>), like its counterparts, is to be rendered, you are not permitted (thou mayest not). See I.E. on Deut. 17:15; 21:16.</i>

Verse 4

FALLEN DOWN. <i>Nofelim</i> (fallen down) means crouching. The word <i>nofelim</i> is a general term.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It applies to all sorts of non-standing positions.</i>
THOU SHALT SURELY HELP HIM TO LIFT THEM UP AGAIN. Not by yourself.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">You do not have to do the lifting by yourself. You are obligated to help the owner lift the animal. However, this obligation does not apply in instances where the owner stands by and does not assist you.</i> Compare, <i>thou shalt surely release it with him</i> (Ex. 23:5).

Verse 5

A WOMAN SHALL NOT WEAR THAT WHICH PERTAINETH UNTO A MAN. This law was stated here because Scripture deals with going out to war. Women were created only to have children.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Legitimate children.</i> If a woman joins men in going to war she will come to engage in illicit sexual relations on the way.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Women who march off to war with men will have relations with them and produce illegitimate children. I.E. most probably inserted “on the way” because he wanted to explain why this law follows the previous one. It does so because both deal with something happening on the way. See I.E.’s comments on verse 6 and the notes thereto.</i> The law that states <i>neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment</i> is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The purpose of the law is to prevent illicit sexual intercourse.</i> The reason for this law is as follows. If a male who does not have a full beard<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A full beard is not to be taken literally. It means enough facial hair to indicate that the person is a male.</i> mixes with women, then he and they will have sexual relations without anyone knowing.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>ve-en yode’a</i>, as in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. A male dressing as a female has access to women. Rashi has a similar explanation.</i> This law indicates that the custom of Israel was for the garments of men to be unlike the garments of women. There was a definite difference between the garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Of males and females.</i> This is also the practice in most countries. Some say that our verse speaks of unnatural intercourse.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to homosexuality.</i> However, there is no need for this interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse should be taken in accordance with its plain meaning.</i> The fact is that God abominates the one who changes the works of the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Which cross dressing does, for one is then unable to distinguish between male and female.</i>

Verse 6

IF A BIRD’S NEST CHANCE TO BE BEFORE THEE IN THE WAY. This section<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 6 and 7.</i> follows because Scripture earlier mentioned <i>by the way</i> (v. 4).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Both sections thus have a common theme.</i>
CHANCE. The word <i>yikkare</i> (chance) is similar to <i>nikro nikreti</i> (As I happened by chance) (II Sam. 1:6). These words have the meaning of chance.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>yikkare</i> and of <i>nikro nikreti</i> is <i>kof, resh, alef</i>. This root means to call. However, this meaning would be out of place here and in II Sam. 1:6. Hence I.E. points out that our root is a variant of <i>kof, resh, heh</i>, which means to meet or to chance upon.</i> It is close in meaning to “meet.”
[YOUNG ONES.] The <i>alef</i> in <i>efrochim</i> (young ones) is superfluous. It is like the <i>alef</i> of <i>u-ve-ezro’akha</i> (and with your arm) (Jer. 32:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">There is no such word in Scripture. I.E. probably has Jer. 32:21 in mind. However, the reading there is <i>u-ve-ezro’a</i>. I.E. probably quoted from memory.</i> It is very cruel to crush a mother with her children. Hence the reason for this law. The same applies to an ox <sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 22:28.</i> or a sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>. Lev. 22:28 prohibits the killing of a lamb or an ox and its mother in the same day.</i>

Verse 7

THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH THEE. For God will pity you and do good things for you.
AND THAT THOU MAYEST PROLONG THY DAYS. As you did not exterminate all of the nest but left its root.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The mother bird. God will repay you measure for measure.</i>

Verse 8

WHEN THOU BUILDEST A NEW HOUSE. This section<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 8 and 9.</i> is placed here because it deals with Israel in its land after they wage war. Scripture opens with the law dealing with a house.
A PARAPET. The meaning of <i>ma’akeh</i> (parapet) is known from its context. It has no neighbor.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is not found again in Scripture.</i> A grammarian connected it to the word <i>akat</i> (oppression of) in <i>the oppression of the wicked</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The grammarian reads this as the enclosure of the wicked; i.e., the wicked surround him with trouble.</i> (Ps. 55:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The roof is enclosed by the fence.</i> However, he oppressed himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">By offering an unacceptable interpretation.

IF ANY MAN FALL.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, for the one who falls will fall.</i> Scripture speaks of the end result.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture refers to the person who will fall as the one who falls, even though he had not yet fallen.</i> The following are similar: <i>The dead shall be put to death</i> (Deut. 17:6);<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> <i>And stripped the naked of their garments</i> (Job 22:6);<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The naked cannot be stripped.

After laying down the law dealing with the house, Scripture goes on to deal with the laws of seeds and plants, for after entering the land the Israelite would build a house and then plant.

Verse 9

THOU SHALT NOT SOW THY VINEYARD. The following is the meaning of <i>pen tikdash</i> (lest the fullness): Rabbi Menachem ben Saruk the Sephardi has already explained in his notebook that the word <i>tikdash</i> (fullness) is related to the word <i>kodesh</i> (holy).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>kodesh</i> can also be taken to mean profaned. See Rashi.</i> [The product of two seeds sown together becomes holy] because one mixes with the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. does not explain why. He most likely believed that producing a species which God did not create was emulating God’s work. The product was thus a godlike creation and holy.</i>

Verse 10

THOU SHALT NOT PLOW WITH AN OX AND AN ASS. This law is connected to the one dealing with sowing two kinds of seed. God had mercy on his creatures. An ass is not as strong as an ox. The law prohibiting the mixture of linen and wool<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shatnez</i>.</i> follows<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 10.</i> because Scripture earlier mentioned the prohibition of mixing seeds. This law was previously mentioned in general terms.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In Lev. 19:19. There, Scripture forbids the wearing of a garment from of a mixture.

It is similar to the fringes that are to be worn during the day. Scripture therefore reads, <i>wherewith thou coverest thyself</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">To indicate that it deals with fringes that are to be worn at night.</i> However, the transmitters of tradition say that our verse speaks of the fringes that are to be worn during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Menachot</i> 43a.</i> The meaning of <i>gedilim</i> (twisted cords) is similar to the word <i>gedilim</i> (wreaths) which is employed with regard to the building of the temple. Compare, <i>wreaths</i> (gedilim) <i>of chainwork</i> (I Kings 7:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>gedilim</i> means twisted threads, for chain-work means twisted.</i> The deniers connect the word <i>gedilim</i> to the word <i>gedolah</i> (large).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">They saw that <i>gedilim</i> means large threads.</i> We believe only in the words of our ancestors.

Verse 13

IF ANY MAN TAKE A WIFE.

Scripture alludes to marriage as placing a covering over a woman. Cf. Ruth 3:9. The allusion is to sharing one blanket.</i> Its true reason can be explained midrashically. The laws are placed one next to the other because first comes the house, next a garment,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The reference must be to new garments, for one does not build a house if he does not have a garment to wear.</i> and then the mistress of the house.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">A wife.

Verse 21

SHALL STONE HER. Someone most likely slept with her after he betrothed her, for the one who betrothed her would not have done so unless she told him that she was a virgin. The transmitters of the law explained the matter very clearly.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Witnesses are required to the act of adultery if the damsel is to be executed.

According to the Talmud, the virginity of a girl above the age of 12 1/2 dissipates. See <i>Yevamot</i> 59a, “And he (the High Priest) shall take a wife in her virginity (Lev. 21:13) excludes one who is a <i>bogeret</i> (a female above the age of 12 1/2) for her virginity has ended.” I.E. took this statement literally. However, other rabbis interpret this to mean that older women bleed less than those younger than 12 1/2. See <i>Tosafot, Yevamot</i> 59a. Also see <i>Ketuvot</i> 9a,b and Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> comments there. Also see Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Ishut</i> 11:12,13.</i> The law dealing with a married women was connected to the law of the betrothed damsel because Scripture states, <i>and the men of the city shall stone her</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The same penalty is exacted from a woman living in the house of her husband (v. 24).</i>

Now Scripture goes on to further elucidate this topic.

Verse 23

IF THERE BE. When this thing shall happen.

Verse 12

WHEN EVENING COMETH ON. <i>Li-fenot erev</i> (when evening cometh) is similar in meaning to <i>ki fanah ha-yom</i> (for the day declineth) (Jer. 6:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>For the shadows of the evening are stretched out</i>.

Filwarg believes the reference is to about an hour and a third before the onset of night. See I.E. on Gen. 1:18 (Vol. 1, p. 40). “Know that evening begins at sunset and lasts for one and a third hours, during which time a light-like appearance is seen before sunrise.” Also see Rashi: “He should immerse himself close before the setting of the sun” (Rosenbaun and Silberman translation).</i> This also strengthens the opinion of the rabbis of blessed memory.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That a person who experiences a seminal emission immerses himself before sunset.</i> The deniers<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that <i>li-fenot</i> (cometh on) means before.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Karaites, <i>erev</i> refers to night.

[THERE SHALL BE NO HARLOT] The law of the <i>kedeshah</i> (harlot) follows because the previous section deals with a bondman.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Slaves were considered to be promiscuous.</i> The transmitters of tradition say that the term <i>kadesh</i> (sodomite) refers to the one who is slept with.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The one who takes the passive position in male homosexual intercourse.</i> The phrase <i>of the sons of Israel</i> is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">That the reference is to the passive partner in male homosexuality, for the term “of” implies passivity.

Hence within the context of our verse it alludes to the docile sex partner.</i> Elihu said, [<i>Their soul perisheth in youth] And their life as that of the depraved</i> (kedeshim) (Job 36:14); <i>their soul</i> corresponds to <i>their life</i> and <i>kedeshim</i> corresponds to <i>in youth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders this like youth; that is, their soul perishes like the souls of young men who are sodomites.</i> Scripture also states, <i>And there were also sodomites</i> (kadesh) <i>in the land</i> (I Kings 14:24); <i>the house of the sodomites</i> (kedeshim) II Kings 23:7). Scripture there continues, <i>where the women</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes this reference to be to prostitutes (Krinsky).</i> <i>wove coverings</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). I do not understand the meaning of the word <i>kedeshah</i>. (harlot). When we investigate carefully the meaning of the word we find that it refers to a woman who is known to be prepared to offer herself to all who come and go. <i>Where is the harlot</i> (kedeshah) (Gen. 38:21) is proof of this. If this is so,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">If the term <i>kedeshah</i> refers to a female engaged in heterosexual intercourse, then so must the term <i>kadesh</i>, for <i>kadesh</i> is the masculine form of the noun.</i> then the term <i>kadesh</i> refers to an Egyptian-like practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. believed that the ancient Egyptians were weak, and when they reached the age of forty they did not have the strength to deflower a virgin.

Verse 20

THOU SHALT NOT LEND UPON INTEREST TO THY BROTHER. This law is mentioned here because Scripture earlier mentions the non-Jewish bondman (v. 17). Scripture states that even though it is prohibited to wrong the latter,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The foreign bondman who has found refuge in Israel.</i> it is permitted to take interest from him.

Verse 21



Verse 22

WHEN THOU SHALT VOW A VOW. This law follows because Scripture mentioned <i>for any vow</i> when it spoke of <i>the hire of a harlot</i> (v. 19).
FOR THE LORD THY GOD WILL SURELY REQUIRE IT. This is a metaphoric statement. God will act like a person.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Who demands what was promised to him.</i> He will demand what you vowed.
AND IT WILL BE SIN IN THEE. <i>Chet</i> (sin) means punishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">“In Hebrew…and the harsh punishment which comes as a result of iniquity is occasionally referred to as sin” [I.E. on Gen. 4:11 (Vol. 1, p. 84)].</i>

According to I.E. comments on Lev. 7:15 a <i>neder</i> refers to a vow made in a time of stress, a <i>nedavah</i> refers to an offering brought whenever the spirit moves a person to do so. For the talmudic point of view see Megillah 1:6.</i> However, not every free-will offering is a vow offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">One may set aside an offering without making a vow to do so.</i> The aforementioned is clear.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E on Lev. 7:16.</i>

Verse 25

WHEN THOU COMEST INTO THY NEIGHBOR’S VINEYARD. To harvest grapes<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">As a laborer.</i> then you are permitted to eat of them.

IN THY VESSEL. The word <i>kelyekha</i> (thy vessel) is similar to the word <i>edyekha</i> (thy ornaments) (Ex. 33:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">It is similarly vocalized.</i>

Verse 26

WHEN THOU COMEST INTO THY NEIGHBOR’S STANDING CORN. To harvest.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">As a laborer.</i>

Chapter 24



Verse 1

WHEN A MAN TAKETH A WIFE. She is also considered fit.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>kesherah</i>. However, she is disliked by her husband. I.E. takes issue with Beth Shamai, which interprets <i>some unseemly thing</i> as a sexual transgression. See <i>Mishnah, Gitten</i> 9:10. Other editions read, she is also considered as a field (<i>ke-sadeh</i>). A woman, like a field, is acquired by a money transaction. See <i>Kedushin</i> 2a. Hence the law regarding a woman follows that of the field. Filwarg believes that I.E. compares a woman to a field in that both are seeded and produce fruit.</i>
FAVOR IN HIS EYES. For her nature is the reverse of his.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The reason that she did not find favor in her husband’s eyes was not due to a moral imperfection.</i>
AND HE HATH FOUND.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>u-matza</i>. I.E.’s reading is <i>And he had found</i>. The problem is that the verse reads <i>ki matza</i> (because he has found). Weiser suggests that <i>u-matza</i> is I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>ki matza</i>. However, I.E. goes on to prove that the <i>vav</i> prefixed to a word sometimes has the meaning of “or.” It is a bit farfetched to say that I.E. intends to say that <i>ki matza</i> should be interpreted as <i>u-matza</i>, and that <i>u-matza</i> should be interpreted as <i>or has found</i>, because a <i>vav</i> sometimes has the meaning of or. It thus appears either that I.E.’s copy of Deuteronomy had <i>u-matza</i> or that I.E. quoted from memory and committed an egregious error.</i> And he cannot reveal it,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The moral imperfection found in her.</i> for he has no witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To the immoral act that he accuses her of.</i> The meaning of <i>and he hath found</i> is, or he hath found, as in <i>And he that smiteth his father, or his mother</i> (Ex. 21:15).

Verse 2

AND SHE DEPARTETH. She will not return there.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">To his house.</i> It is public knowledge that she left his house permanently.
AND BECOMETH. She becomes another man’s wife.
[ANOTHER.] The words <i>acher</i> (another) and <i>acharon</i> (latter) (v. 3) are adjectives.

Verse 3

OF DIVORCEMENT. A bill of divorce is called a <i>sefer keritut</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a book of severance.</i> because their marriage has been severed forever. 

Verse 4

AFTER THAT SHE IS DEFILED. With regard to the first husband. Its meaning is defiled to him because another man knew her. The <i>tet</i> of <i>huttamma’ah</i> (she is defiled) receives a <i>dagesh</i> to compensate for the missing <i>tav</i> of the <i>hitpa’el</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Which should have followed the <i>heh</i>.</i> Similarly the word <i>hukkabbes</i> (is washed) in <i>after that the plague is washed</i> (Lev. 13:55).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It too is a <i>hitpa’el</i> with the <i>tav</i> of the form omitted. The latter is compensated by placing a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>caf</i>.</i>
AND THOU SHALT NOT CAUSE THE LAND TO SIN. This is a command to Israel.

Verse 5

A NEW WIFE. Some say a virgin.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, new means a woman who was never married.</i> According to many its meaning is new to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Even a widow or divorcee.</i> for it is possible for a man to remarry the woman whom he has divorced if she has not been defiled. Scripture therefore reads a new wife.
HE SHALL BE FREE FOR HIS HOUSE. The yoke of the king shall not be upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He shall not be conscripted into doing any of the king’s service.</i>
FREE. <i>Naki</i> (free) is similar to <i>naki</i> (innocent)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, free from guilt.</i> in <i>him that is innocent</i> (Job 22:30).
[WITH ANY BUSINESS.] The <i>lamed</i> placed before <i>le-khol davar</i> (with any business) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-khol davar</i> should be read <i>kol davar. Le-khol davar</i> literally means to any business. <i>Khol davar</i> means any business.</i> It is like the <i>lamed</i> in <i>le-avshalom</i> (Absalom) in <i>the third, Absalom</i> (I Chron. 3:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ha-shelishi le-avshalom</i>. Literally, the third, to Absalom. However, the context does not permit this interpretation. Hence the <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-avshalom</i> is superfluous, and <i>le-avshalom</i> is to be read as if written <i>avshalom</i>.</i>

Verse 6

NO MAN SHALL TAKE THE MILL OR THE UPPER MILLSTONE TO PLEDGE. The deniers<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that this section is connected to <i>and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken</i> (v. 5),<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Karaite Bible commentator Levi ben Yefet. According to Levi ben Yefet the meaning of our clause is that a man (the upper millstone) or a woman (the mill) shall not abstain from sexual relations with each other. The Hebrew word for take to pledge is <i>lo yachavol</i>. This can be rendered, he shall not harm (Krinsky). Thus the meaning of our verse is, one shall not harm his partner by refraining from taking the upper position (the upper millstone) or the lower position (the mill).</i> for our verse alludes to coitus, namely, that it is forbidden to abstain from sexual intercourse. However, this is sheer nonsense. They offer as proof, <i>Then let my wife grind unto another</i> (Job 31:10). I have previously explained the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">That intercourse is metaphorically described by the term “grinding.” See I.E. on Job 31:10.</i> The truth is that our verse is to be taken at face value,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that “grind” is used as a metaphor for sexual intercourse in Job.</i> that a person is prohibited from taking a mill to pledge. The word <i>chovel</i> (one who takes a pledge) is missing from our verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>lo yachavol rechayim va-rechev</i>. This literally means he shall not take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge. The question is: To whom does “he” refer? Hence I.E. points out that the word <i>chovel</i> (anyone that takes a pledge) has been omitted. Our verse should be read as if written, <i>lo yachavol chovel rechayim va-rechev</i> (any one that takes a pledge shall not take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge).</i> It is similar to <i>and he said to Joseph</i> (Gen. 48:1) and to <i>whom she bore to Levi</i> (Num. 26:29), for the meaning of the former is, someone said to Joseph, and of the latter, the one who bore, bore to Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. Gen. 48:1 (Vol. 1, p. 412).</i> There are many such cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Where Scripture omits the subject.</i>
THE MILL. The word <i>rechayim</i> (mill) is in the dual form. It does not come in the singular.
THE UPPER MILLSTONE. <i>Rechev</i> (upper millstone) refers to a water mill. Others say that it refers to the wood which is placed on the mill.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is probably to a wooden handle which was used to turn the upper stone.</i> Still others say that the <i>rechayim</i> (mill) refers to the lower millstone and <i>rechev</i> to the upper millstone.
FOR HE TAKETH A MAN’S LIFE TO PLEDGE. For life is sustained by these instruments. Those who rely on the juxtaposition of the sections have no argument,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">That our verse speaks metaphorically of sexual intercourse.</i> for each commandment stands by itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The commandments are not necessarily tied together. Each commandment is an independent unit.</i> The explanation of their juxtapositions is midrashic.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">It therefore cannot be used as a reason to interpret a law metaphorically when the plain meaning of the text is acceptable.</i> This section<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The law regarding taking a mill to pledge.</i> is connected to the previous ones in the following way:<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">That is, if we want to connect this section midrashically to what comes before, we can so in the following manner.</i> the Torah mentions that one is not to steal grapes by putting them in his pots (Deut. 23:25), or to lift up a sickle upon his neighbor’s grain (Deut. 23:26); or to take a woman after she has been his and then left his house and married another (v. 1). It also states that one has to cheer the woman whom he marries (v. 5); he is not to be oppressed by going into the army (<i>Ibid.</i>). The taking of a millstone in pledge is a form of oppression.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the positioning of our law.</i> So too is kidnapping a person. Similarly the plague of leprosy, for if he does not observe its laws then the plague will injure those in proximity to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">By infecting them.</i> Scripture similarly states, do not oppress a poor person by taking a pledge from him (v. 10). It similarly states do not oppress a hired person (v. 14) and small children should not be put to death for the sins of the fathers (v. 16). It likewise warns against perverting the justice due a stranger or the fatherless (v. 17). It prohibits the taking of a widow’s garment as a pledge (v. 17). It prohibits one from retrieving a sheaf which was forgotten in the field, for it belongs to the poor (v. 19). Similarly <i>Thou shalt not glean</i> (v. 21). Likewise <i>lest if he should exceed…Then thy brother should be dishonored</i> (Deut. 25:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 25:3 prohibits the infliction of more that 40 stripes to one being punished by lashes. Exceeding this number of stripes is a form of oppression.</i> The muzzling of an ox (v. 4) is an act of oppression, for the animal toils but cannot eat of its toil. Similarly, refusing to perform levirate marriage (Deut. 25:5-10) is a form of oppression. The woman who grabs a man’s testicles (Deut. 25:11) commits an act of oppression. Employing diverse weights and diverse measures (Deut. 25:13,14) is oppression in its purest form. Furthermore, Amalek oppressed Israel (Deut. 25:17-19).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the laws in Deut. 23:25-25:19 are thematically related. Hence the law prohibiting the taking of a mill was included in this section.</i>

Verse 7

ANY OF HIS BRETHREN. Scripture adds <i>of the children of Israel</i> because the Edomites are called brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, brethren in our verse applies only to an Israelite. Edom is referred to as Israel’s brother in verse 34.</i>
AND HE DEAL WITH HIM AS A SLAVE. The word <i>vehitammer</i> (and he deal with him as a slave) is to be explained as its counterpart.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Titammer</i> (deal with…as a slave) in Deut. 21:14. I.E. there explains it to mean treacherously.</i>

Verse 8

Verse 9

UNTO MIRIAM. Here is proof of the midrashic statement that we should not read the word <i>metzora</i> as <i>metzora</i> (a leper) but as an acronym for <i>motzi shem ra</i> (one who invents libel).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanchumah</i> on the Torah portion <i>Metzora</i> 2. According to the rabbis, leprosy is a punishment for speaking ill of one’s neighbor. Miriam was punished with leprosy for speaking ill of Moses (see Num. 12). According to I.E., Scripture’s telling us that we are to recall Miriam’s punishment is another way of saying, remember the punishment for speaking ill of your neighbor.</i>

Verse 10

DOST LEND. The word <i>tasheh</i> (thou…dost lend) comes from the root <i>nun, shin, heh</i>. 
The <i>heh</i> of the word <i>me’umah</i> (any manner of loan) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The basic word is <i>me’um</i>. Compare, Job 31:7; Dan. 1:4.</i> It is like the <i>heh</i> of <i>laylah</i> (night).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The basic word is <i>layil</i>. Compare, Is. 16:3. See I.E. on Gen. 1:5 (Vol. 1, p. 33).</i>
TO FETCH. To take his pledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>la’avot avoto</i>. I.E. notes that the verb <i>la’avot</i> means to take a pledge. In other words, Scripture uses a verb which is derived from a noun. Compare, <i>tadshe ha-aretz deshe</i> (let the earth put forth grass) (Gen. 1:11).</i>

[THE PLEDGE.] I have previously explained the meaning of the pledge<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The reason for returning the pledge at night.</i> in the Torah portion <i>Now These Are the Ordinances</i> (Ex 21:1) in my comments on “his garment” (Ex. 22:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 22:6 (Vol. 2, p. 490): “Saadiah Gaon asks, what reason is there to take the pledge during the day and to return it at night?

Verse 16

[THE FATHERS SHALL NOT BE PUT TO DEATH.] Those whose spirits wander ask: “How could Scripture say: <i>The fathers shall not he put to death…</i>when it says in another place, <i>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</i> (Ex. 20:5; Deut. 5:9)?” Their question is nonsense, for <i>the fathers shall not he put to death for the children</i> is a commandment directed to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">A law court is prohibited from punishing children for the sins of their father.</i> However, God is the one who metes out punishment in <i>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</i>.

The word <i>bin</i> (deserve) is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is usually vocalized with a <i>segol</i>, i.e., <i>ben</i>.</i> Compare, <i>bin nun</i> (son of Nun) (Josh. 1:1) and <i>bin yakeh</i> (son of Jakeh) (Prov. 30:1). <i>Bin hakkot</i> (deserve to be beaten) is similar to <i>ben bliyya’al</i> (a base fellow) (I Sam. 25:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ben</i> usually means son of. However, in <i>bin hakkot</i> and <i>ben bliyya’al, ben</i> signifies that the subject belongs to a certain group.</i> <i>Bin laylah</i> (in a night) in <i>which came up in a night</i> (Jonah 4:10) is similar. The judge is obligated to beat him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bin hakkot</i> means that the wicked falls into the category of those whom the judge is obligated to have beaten.</i> I believe that Scripture calls the culprit wicked<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>rasha</i>.</i> because he struck his neighbor.
THAT THE JUDGE SHALL CAUSE HIM TO LIE DOWN. By command.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The judge shall ask officers of the court to place him in a prone position.</i> The same applies to <i>and to be beaten</i>, as <i>before his</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The judge’s.</i> <i>face</i> proves.
ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF HIS WICKEDNESS, BY NUMBER. Of blows. It would have appeared to us, were it not for the words of tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Which tells us that whenever the punishment of flogging is administered, thirty-nine (39) lashes are inflicted.</i> that there are some sins that a person is punished for with ten blows. Others are punished with twenty blows. Other sins are punished with a lesser or greater number. The clause <i>according to the measure of his wickedness</i> is proof of this. In any case,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Regardless of the sin committed.</i> the blows shall not exceed forty. However, the words of tradition alone are true.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That all those who are punished by flogging receive 39 lashes.</i> Others say that <i>his wickedness</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>according to the measure of his wickedness</i>.</i> refers to greater or lesser blows,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to the intensity of the blows.</i> all of which number forty.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, all those who are punished by flogging receive 40 lashes. However, their intensity varies according to the type of sin committed.</i>

Verse 3

THEN THY BROTHER SHOULD BE DISHONORED. For the thing<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">That this particular individual is flogged.</i> is well known. It is a decree from the Almighty that the sufferer suffer forty blows. This is a decree from heaven so that the number of blows not depend on the will of the judge. 

Verse 4

[WHEN HE TREADETH.] The deniers<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites.</i> say that the <i>bet</i> in <i>be-disho</i> (when he treadeth down) indicates prior to treading.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The deniers render <i>be-disho</i>, before he treads. The muzzle is not put on the animal while he treads. It is put on the animal before the treading begins. Hence their interpretation.</i> However, this is unnecessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">For the meaning of Scripture is, do not put a muzzle on the animal so that it is muzzled while it treads the grain.</i>

Verse 5

IF BRETHREN<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>achim</i> (brothers).</i> DWELL TOGETHER. The deniers also say that these brethren<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The brothers spoken of in our verse.</i> are not actual brothers,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture explicitly prohibits a man from marrying his sister-inlaw. See Lev. 18:6.</i> but are relatives. They brought proof from Boaz.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Boaz married Ruth, who was the wife of his deceased relative, <i>to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance</i> (Ruth 4:5).</i> However, they contribute nothing, for there is no mention of levirate marriage,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In the Book of Ruth.</i> only of redemption.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Boaz married Ruth so that her husband’s field would not pass into the hands of a stranger. He thus “redeemed” the said field. See Ruth 4:1-6.</i> Why mention the word <i>together</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> Does it matter if they were in one state or in one courtyard, or if they loved each other?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Rabbinic tradition the word brethren means brothers and together means alive at the same time. However, if we accept the Karaitic interpretation then we do not know what Scripture means by the word together.</i> They say,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. <i>Mikra’ot Gedolot</i> reads: He says.</i> look, the verse says <i>ve-yibbemah</i> (and shall perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>yavam</i> means a brother-in-law.</i> This shows that he is her brother-in-law in name only.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites interpret <i>ve-yibbemah</i> as, and be a brother-in-law to her. Now if the true brother-in-law was being addressed Scripture would not say, and be a brother-in-law to her. Hence we must interpret <i>ve-yibbemah</i> as meaning “act as a brother-in-law to her.” The upshot of all this is that a true brother-in-law is not being addressed.</i> It is like <i>thy sister-in-law</i> (yevimtekh)<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevimtekh</i> is the word <i>yevamah</i> (sister-in-law) plus the second person personal pronoun. Orpah was the wife of Ruth’s brother-in-law (<i>yavam</i>). She is referred to as a <i>yevamah</i> because she took her husband’s place. We thus see that the term <i>yavam</i> in its various forms can refer to one who acts like one’s brother-in-law.</i> <i>is gone back</i> (Ruth 1:15). Now observe that they have become foolish and stupid, for Scripture states, with regard to the sons of Judah, <i>and perform the duty of a husband’s brother</i> (ve-yabbem) <i>unto her</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Tamar, the widow of Er the son of Judah.</i> (Gen. 38:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Judah told his son Onan to go <i>and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto</i> your sister-in-law Tamar.</i> Now he<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Onan the brother of Er.</i> was her<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Tamar’s.</i> brother-in-law.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">It is thus clear that levirate marriage was performed by the actual brother-in-law.</i> Also, the term <i>yevimtekh</i> (thy sister-in-law) (Ruth 1:15) was used because they were married to two brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the term <i>yevamah</i> was not employed figuratively in Ruth.</i> All intelligent people know that the negative commandments given to Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Excluding the Noahide laws, which were given to Adam and Noah (see Meijler).</i> were not previously prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">There was thus no prohibition before the revelation at Sinai against a man to marrying his sister-in-law.</i> However, it would not have been evil in the eyes of God if someone abstained from them<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That is, from those negative commandments from which reason tells us to abstain.</i> before the law was given to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, God would have been pleased with a person who abstained from practices which He would later prohibit. If the law prohibiting intercourse with a sister-in-law was based on reason, i.e., it was an abomination, then Scripture would not have condemned Onan for not wanting to impregnate his sister-in-law.</i> The fact that Scripture states, <i>for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you</i> (Lev. 18:27), shows that this is certainly the case. We do not find a prophet who warned them.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">From engaging in the practices that Lev. 18:27 refers to, for Scripture believes that one ought to know not to engage in these practices by employing one’s rationality. See <i>Yesod Mora</i> 5: “The fundamental commandments are those precepts that are implanted in the heart. They…were known by reason before the Torah was given through the agency of Moses” (Strickman translation, p. 75).</i> Look, Scripture says of Onan, who did not give seed to his brother, <i>the thing which he did was evil in the sight of God</i> (Gen. 38:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">God thus wants a brother to marry the childless widow of his biological brother.</i> We will therefore rely on the tradition that they are actual brothers.
AND HAVE NO CHILD. For if the deceased has a son, there is no need for him<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The living brother.</i> to take his brother’s wife, for she is forbidden to him. 
The word <i>yachdav</i> (together) is to be understood in accordance with the explanation of the transmitters of tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis, “together” means that they were alive at the same time. See <i>Yevamot</i> 17b.</i>
ONE NOT OF HIS KIN. This explains the term <i>ha-chutzah</i> (abroad).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, abroad (<i>ha-chutzah</i>) means to <i>one not of his kin</i>.</i> This law applies only if the brother-in-law intends to marry her.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">If her brother-in-law does not want to marry her, she is free to marry anyone else after the ceremony of <i>chalitzah</i> has been performed.</i>

Verse 6

THE FIRST-BORN THAT SHE BEARETH. Will be called by the name of his<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Deceased.</i> brother.
THAT HIS NAME BE NOT BLOTTED OUT. Scripture speaks of his inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The property of the dead brother will be given to the first son born of the levirate marriage. The name of the deceased will thus be tied to his property, for people will say, “This is the property of the deceased, which his ‘son’ (actually his nephew) inherited.”</i> I have previously explained the meaning of <i>that she beareth</i> in my comments on <i>unto a foreign people</i> (Ex. 21:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis, <i>And it shall be, that the first-born that she beareth…</i>refers to the deceased’s first-born brother (<i>Yevamot</i> 24a). See Rashi on this verse, “It is the eldest brother who is to perform the duty of levirate marriage.” I.E. in his short commentary on Ex. 21:8 states that this interpretation is not in keeping with the plain meaning of the verse.</i>

Verse 7

MY HUSBAND’S BROTHER. The <i>yod</i> of <i>yevami</i> (my husband’s brother) is in fact the sign of the object.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>yevami</i> is not the noun <i>yavam</i> (brother-in-law) plus the <i>yod</i> suffix meaning “my” but a combination of the verb <i>yabem</i> plus the <i>yo</i>d suffix meaning me. According to this interpretation <i>yevami</i> means to act as a brother-in-law to me.</i>

Verse 8

AND IF HE STAND, AND SAY. Until the elders hear.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In a voice audible to the elders.</i>

Verse 9

AND LOOSE. <i>Ve-chaletzah</i> (and loose) is similar to <i>chaletzu</i> (draw out) in <i>draw out the breast</i> (Lam. 3:4). Its meaning is to remove.
IN HIS FACE. The transmitters of tradition explain that the word <i>be-fanav</i> (in his face) has the meaning of before his face.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 106b.</i> According to its plain meaning, <i>be-fanav</i> means before the shoe, for <i>panav</i> here is similar to <i>panim</i> (in front) in <i>front and on the back</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E</i> (Ezek. 2:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>befanav</i> means before it, i.e., before the shoe.</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11

WHEN MEN STRIVE. The reverse of <i>If brethren dwell together</i> (v. 5).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">There is thus a thematic connection between this law and the one that precedes it. Hence its juxtaposition.</i> The men spoken of are strangers or brothers.
BY THE SECRETS. <i>Mevushav</i> (the secrets) means his testicles. It is related to the word <i>bushah</i> (shame).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>bet, vav, shin</i>. The literal meaning of <i>mevushav</i> is, his shameful things. Hence I.E.’s interpretation that <i>mevushav</i> (the secrets) means his testicles.</i> It is an act of audacity to uncover that which is hidden, namely, a person’s nakedness. It is also a vital organ.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a dangerous place. Hence the severe punishment.</i>

Verse 12

THEN THOU SHALT CUT OFF HER HAND. If she does not pay ransom money. Its meaning is similar to <i>eye for eye</i> (Ex. 21:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 21:24 (Vol. 2, p. 477), “It is fitting for the culprit to give his eye in place of the victim’s eye if he does not pay ransom for it.”</i>
THINE EYE SHALL HAVE NO PITY. If she be poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">And cannot afford to ransom her eye.</i>

FOR ALL THAT DO SUCH THINGS. Those who possess diverse measures and diverse weights. This is followed by a general rule, namely, <i>even all that do unrighteously</i> verbally and by deed, secretly or publicly.

Verse 17



Verse 18

HOW HE MET THEE. <i>Karekha</i> (met thee) is related to the word <i>korot</i> (befallen) in <i>all that had befallen them</i> (Gen. 42:29).
AND SMOTE THE HINDMOST OF THEE. <i>Va-yezanev bekhah</i> (and smote the hindmost of thee) means,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>zanav</i> means a tail.

It is possible that the word <i>necheshalim</i> (enfeebled)<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which is <i>chet, shin, lamed</i>.</i> is similar to <i>nechelashim</i> (enfeebled).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which is <i>chet, lamed, shin</i>.</i> Similarly <i>keves</i> (lamb) and <i>kesev</i> (lamb).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">These words come from one basic root.

Verse 19

WHEN THE LORD THY GOD HATH GIVEN THEE REST.

THAT THOU SHALT BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE. Namely, <i>slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass</i> (I Sam 15:3), so that no one says this ox is from the spoil taken from Amalek. The words of the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The clause, <i>thou shalt blot out the name of Amalek</i>, is a general statement.</i> are a general statement. The words of the prophet Samuel<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>But slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass</i>.</i> go into detail.
THOU SHALT NOT FORGET. Scripture says this after having already stated <i>Remember…</i>(v. 17) for emphasis. The same is true with many other commandments in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture repeats itself for emphasis.</i>

Chapter 26



Verse 1

AND IT SHALL BE, WHEN THOU ART COME. Since Scripture wrote, <i>Therefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest</i> (Deut. 25:19),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Then you shall go to war against Amalek and destroy him.</i> God now says that there are commandments that must be observed before He gives you rest. In fact, these commandments take effect as soon as you enter the land. They are: the first fruits,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 2-11.</i> the tithes,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 12-15.</i> writing the Torah on the stones,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 27:1-3.</i> building the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4-6.</i> and the blessing and the curse on the two mountains.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mount Grezim and Mount Ebal (Deut. 27:11-26).</i>

Verse 2

IN A BASKET. <i>Tene</i> (basket) is a basket-like receptacle.

Verse 3

[THAT SHALL BE IN THOSE DAYS.] <i>In those days</i> means that this law is in force as long as there is a <i>kohen gadol</i> there.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the sanctuary.</i>
I PROFESS. The reason for this utterance is so that the children will hear. Or it is, like a statement of thanks to God, for He has fulfilled his oath.

Verse 4



Verse 5

AND THOU SHALT SPEAK. It is possible that the <i>kohanim</i> will ask,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The celebrant.</i> “What is this that you brought?” Hence Scripture reads <i>ve-anita</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and you shall answer. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> (and thou shalt speak). On the other hand, <i>ve-anita</i> may mean, and you shall begin speaking. Compare, <i>And Job spoke</i> (va-ya’an)<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-ya’an</i> and <i>ve-anita</i> come from the same root.</i> <i>and said</i> (Job 3:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In this case we do not have to assume that the <i>kohanim</i> asked the worshipper, “What is this that you brought?”</i>
A WANDERING ARAMEAN. The word <i>oved</i> (wandering) is an intransitive verb. If Aramean referred to Laban<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">According to the midrash, <i>arami oved avi</i> (a wandering Aramean was my father) is to be rendered an Aramean (Laban) sought to destroy my father (Jacob). See <i>Sifre</i>, the Passover Haggadah, and Rashi.</i> then Scripture should have read <i>mavid or me’abbed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For these are the transitive forms of the verb.</i> Furthermore, what reason would Scripture have had for stating, <i>Laban sought to destroy my father and he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">My father.</i> <i>went down to Egypt</i>? Laban did not cause Jacob to descend to Egypt. It thus appears to me that the term Aramean refers to Jacob. Scripture, as it were, reads, when my father was in Aram he was “perishing.” That is, he was poor, he had no money. Similarly <i>oved</i> (perish) in <i>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish</i> (Prov. 31:6). <i>Let him drink, and forget his poverty</i> (Prov. 31:7) is proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">That “perish” in the previous verse refers to poverty.</i> The meaning of our phrase thus is, a perishing Aramean was my father. Its import is, I did not inherit the land from my father, for my father was poor when he came to Aram.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">When he fled from his brother Esau.</i> He was also a stranger in Egypt. He was few in number.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">When he came down to Egypt.</i> He then became a large nation.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In Egypt.</i> You O Lord took us out of slavery and gave us a good land.

However, the word <i>am</i> has been omitted from our text. Our verse should be read as if written, <i>mete am me’at</i> (Krinsky).</i> for it is not found in the singular.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the form <i>mete</i> cannot be in the construct with <i>me’at</i>, which is a singular. If <i>mete</i> was in the construct with <i>me’at</i> then our text would read, <i>mete me’atim</i>.</i> The word <i>metim</i> is a plural. Rabbi Jonah the grammarian explained it very well under the entry <i>mem, tav, heh</i>.

Verse 13

I HAVE PUT AWAY THE HALLOWED THINGS. The reference is to the tithe. I have also not deposited it.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">With another person.</i> On the contrary, I have handed it over to the one I am obligated to give it to.
I HAVE NOT TRANSGRESSED. Deliberately.
NEITHER HAVE I FORGOTTEN THEM.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, neither have I forgotten.

Verse 14

I HAVE NOT EATEN THEREOF IN MY MOURNING. The word <i>oni</i> (my mourning) is similar to the word <i>oni</i> (sorrow) in <i>ben-oni</i> (the son of my sorrow) (Gen. 35:18) and <i>onim</i> (mourners) in <i>bread of mourners</i> (Hosea 9:4). I alluded<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear where.</i> to its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is probably to bread of mourners.</i> in Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This line is not found in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. Some emend our verse to read, “in my book on the Hebrew language (<i>Moznayim</i>).” See Weiser.</i> The meaning of <i>oni</i> is, my mourning.

Some editions read <i>lo akhalti kodesh ha-ma’aser</i>, I did not eat the holy, the tithe. The latter is forbidden to a mourner in the time between the death and burial of a close relative.</i>
NEITHER HAVE I PUT AWAY THEREOF. This means neither did I destroy any of that which was holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I did not destroy any of the tithe.</i>
BEING UNCLEAN. <i>Be-tame</i> (being unclean) means for something unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>bet</i> of <i>be-tame</i> means for (Filwarg).</i>
FOR THE DEAD. For the need of the dead.

[A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.] It means a land that will always flow with milk and honey.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>As Thou didst swear unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey</i> is to be interpreted as Thou didst swear unto our fathers a land always (reading <i>tamid</i> as in <i>Vat.

THOU SHALT THEREFORE OBSERVE. In your heart.

Verse 17

THOU HAST AVOUCHED. <i>He’emarta</i> (avouched) means exalted. It is close in meaning to <i>amir</i> (uppermost bough) in <i>In the top of the uppermost bough</i> (Is. 17:6). Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi, who rests in Eden, says that the word is related to <i>va-yomer</i> (said). Its meaning is, you were so righteous that the Lord said He is your God. God likewise acted very righteously towards you that you said that you would be His own treasure. He explained well. Now the word <i>he’emarta</i> is a <i>hifil</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning you caused [Him] to say.

KEEP ALL THE COMMANDMENTS. Namely, <i>that thou shalt set thee up great stones</i> to contain the entire Torah. The Gaon,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> of blessed memory, said that the commandments<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The 613 commandments of the Torah.</i> were listed upon the stones, as in the <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A Geonic compendium by Rabbi Simon Kayyra (ninth century) of Talmudic law arranged according to the order of the tractates of the Talmud. The <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i> was the first to enumerate the 613 commandments. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon uses the <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i> as an illustration of a list of the 613 commandments, for it was the first work to provide such a list.

VERY PLAINLY. The reference is to the writing.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

Scripture mentions <i>the priests and the Levites</i> (v. 9), for they are the ones who said, <i>Cursed be the man</i> (v. 15). The children of the main wives<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The tribes descended from Rachel and Leah.

AND THE LEVITES SHALL SPEAK. <i>Ve-anu</i> (shall speak) is similar to <i>ve-anita</i> (and thou shalt speak) in <i>And thou shalt speak and say</i> (Deut. 26:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 26:5 and the notes thereto.</i> Our rabbis, of blessed memory, said that the meaning of <i>to bless</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture lists only curses in verses 16-21 Blessings are not mentioned. However, the rabbis say that each one of the curses had its blessing counterpart. See <i>Sotah</i> 31a: “They turned their faces towards Mount Gerizim and opened with the blessing: <i>blessed is the man who does not make a graven or molten image</i>, and both parties respond amen. They then turned their faces towards Mount Ebal and opened with the curse: <i>Cursed is the man who maketh a graven or molten image</i>, and both parties respond amen.”</i> is to say, <i>blessed is the man who does not make a graven or molten image</i>, and similarly all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">All of the curses have their blessing counterpart.</i> However, according to the plain meaning of the text, the blessing refers to <i>Blessed shalt thou be in the city</i> (Deut. 28:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the blessing beginning with <i>Blessed shalt thou be in the city</i>, that is, Deut. 28:3-13.</i> The curse is the reverse of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The curse recorded in Deut. 28:16-68 is the reverse of the blessing recorded in Deut. 28:3-13.</i> Proof of this is found in the Book of Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Josh. 3:35. Joshua speaks of the blessings and curses recorded in the Torah. These can only refer to chapter 28, for the blessings spoken of by the rabbis in <i>Sotah</i> are not mentioned in the Torah.</i> 

Verse 15

Scripture mentions these eleven sins<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in verses 15-25.</i> because an individual can commit them in secret. <i>And setteth it up in secret</i> (v. 15) is proof, for if one commits this crime<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Making a graven or molten image.</i> in the open he is put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">By a court of law.</i> <i>He that smiteth his neighbor in secret</i> (v. 24) is similar. Scripture begins with the most important, namely, that which concerns a person and his creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Making a graven or molten image.</i> It then speaks of a person and his parents,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Dishonoring one’s parents.</i> for who knows if he dishonors them.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In the privacy of their home.</i>

Verse 16

DISHONORETH. The word <i>makleh</i> (dishonoreth) means to dishonor. It is a transitive verb.

Verse 17

CURSED BE HE THAT REMOVETH HIS NEIGHBOR’S LANDMARK. For it is done in secret. [MAKETH THE BLIND TO GO ASTRAY.] Likewise it is not possible for the blind person to identify the one who led him astray.

Verse 18



Verse 19

CURSED BE HE THAT PERVERTETH THE JUSTICE DUE TO THE STRANGER, FATHERLESS. For they have no one to help them. Look, this too is done in secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">No one knows why a judge ruled the way he did.</i> Scripture mentions the stranger as well as the orphan and the widow because if the judge perverts the justice due others, they will accuse and publicize him. The stranger, the orphan, and the widow are powerless. Sleeping with one’s father’s wife, with a sister, or with a mother-in-law is an act that is committed in secret, for one is not suspected when he is alone with any one of them. It is not so with other sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hence only these eleven sins are specifically mentioned in Scripture.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

CURSED BE HE THAT LIETH WITH ANY MANNER OF BEAST.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>behemah. Behamah</i> is feminine. Our verse could thus conceivably be translated, cursed be he that lieth with any manner of female beast. Hence I.E.’s comments.</i> Male or female, for neither have a mouth with which to cry out and protest. Thus, a female animal is like a male animal;<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">As neither can cry out and protest verbally.</i> therefore Scripture does not mention the male.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

HE THAT TAKETH A BRIBE. According to many the reference is to the judge. According to my opinion the reference is to a false witness.

Verse 26

THAT CONFIRMETH NOT. Some say that the reference is to the entire Torah. Others say that it refers to the specifically mentioned sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The sins mention in verse 15-25.</i> However, what they say is meaningless, for Scripture says, <i>to do them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The verse curses those who fail to observe positive practices, not only those who violate certain laws.</i> However, it appears to me that Scripture cursed the violators of the precepts which are mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 15-25.</i> It also cursed the one who secretly does not observe the positive commandments. Scripture therefore reads, <i>to do them</i>.

Verse 2

[AND…SHALL COME.] The meaning of <i>And…shall come</i> is that they shall come by themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In pursuit of the blessings. That is, you will not tire yourself in pursuit of what the blessings have to offer.</i>
AND OVERTAKE THEE. Even though you do not pursue them. It means that you will not tire yourself.

Verse 3

IN THE CITY. This is a blessing regarding an increase<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the term blessing mean an increase of good things.

Verse 5

THY BASKET. The place of bread. <i>Thy basket</i> precedes <i>and thy kneading trough</i> but should come after it.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">For the dough has to be kneaded before it is made into bread.</i> On the other hand, <i>thy basket</i> may refer to the place where the flour is placed.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>Thy basket precedes and thy kneading trough</i>.</i>

The reverse is written [in the curses].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19, which states, <i>Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in</i>, etc., is the reverse of our verse.</i> 

Verse 7

[THAT RISE UP AGAINST THEE.] Since Scripture earlier stated that God will set Israel on high above the nations (v. 1), it now goes on to say that should the nations revolt against Israel [the Lord will cause thine enemies] <i>that rise up against thee</i> [to be smitten before thee].
AND…SEVEN. This means many.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Seven is not to be taken literally.</i> The number seven is employed because of the continuous cycle of seven days of the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It is the maximum number of days in the week.

Verse 8

IN THY BARNS. <i>Ba-asamekha</i> (in thy bams) is in your storehouses. Its meaning is determined by its context.

Verse 13

IF THOU SHALT HEARKEN. In your heart to observe and to do.

CONSUMPTION. Some say that <i>shachefet</i> (consumption) refers to various types of illnesses.
WITH FEVER. Each day. <i>Kaddachat</i> (fever) is related to <i>kadechah</i> (kindled) in <i>For a fire is kindled</i> (Deut. 32:22). The words <i>mehumah</i> (discomfiture), <i>migeret</i> (rebuke), <i>shachefet</i> (consumption), <i>kaddachat</i> (fever) and <i>dalleket</i> (inflammation) are adjectives. 
<i>Dalleket</i> refers to a fever which comes every third or fourth day.

Verse 28

MADNESS…] Madness, blindness, and astonishment are afflictions of the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">They afflict the mind.</i>

Verse 29

AND THOU SHALT GROPE. In blindness.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is, and thou shalt grope in blindness.</i>
PROSPEROUS. <i>Tatzli’ach</i> (prosperous) is a transitive verb.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The verb can also be intransitive. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
OPPRESSED AND ROBBED. By the enemy, and there shall be none to save thee. Scripture commences to explain in what manner Israel shall be oppressed.

Verse 30

SHALL LIE WITH HER. <i>Yishgalennah</i> (lie with her) is a euphemism for sexual intercourse. The same applies to the word <i>shegal</i> (the queen) (Ps. 45:10). It refers to a woman prepared for bed.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For sexual intercourse. See I.E. on Ps. 45:10.</i>
USE THE FRUIT THEREFOF. <i>Techallennu</i> (use the fruit thereof) is related to the word <i>chalil</i> (flute).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.

Verse 31



Verse 32

AND FAIL WITH LONGING. The word <i>kalot</i> (fail with longing) is similar to the word <i>kaletah</i> (pineth) in <i>My soul yearneth, yea, even pineth</i> (Ps. 84:3) and to <i>va-tekhal</i> (failed with longing) in <i>va-tekhal david</i> (and caused David to fail with longing)<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> (II Sam. 13:39).

Verse 36

AND THERE SHALT THOU SERVE. And it shall not avail you but you shall become an astonishment. That is, all who see you shall be astonished.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">All who see Israel will be shocked at what happened to them. Rashi interprets similarly.</i>

However, before this, a year of hunger shall come upon you when you are still in your land.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, verse 38 which follows does not speak of the exile but rather of what will precede the exile.</i>

Verse 38

Verse 39

PLANT. You shall toil in planting and in the vineyards.
BUT THOU SHALT NEITHER DRINK OF THE WINE. At the time of the harvest.
NOR GATHER THE GRAPES. <i>Te’egor</i> (gather the grapes) means you will gather. It is a verb. <i>Te’egor</i> is similar to <i>agerah</i> (gathereth) in <i>And gathereth her food in the harvest</i> (Prov. 6:8).

Verse 40

BUT THOU SHALT NOT ANNOINT THYSELF WITH THE OIL. As is the practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">It was the practice of people to anoint themselves.</i> Compare, <i>neither did I anoint myself at all</i> (Dan. 10:3).

Verse 41



Verse 42

SHALL…POSSESS. <i>Yeyaresh</i> (shall possess) is a <i>pi’el.

THE LOCUST. <i>Tzelatzal</i> (locust) is a quadriliteral.

Verse 46

Verse 2



Verse 3

Scripture reads <i>given</i> because God is the first cause.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Man has free will and thus must develop a “knowing heart” on his own.

Verse 11

THAT THOU SHOULDEST ENTER INTO THE COVENANT. <i>Le-ovrekha</i> (that thou shouldest enter) is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">With the pronominal suffix.</i> It is like <i>va-ya’avru</i> (and passed) in <i>and passed between the parts thereof</i> (Jer. 34:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>le-ovrekha</i> (that thou shouldest enter) means that you should pass, i.e., that you should enter the covenant, for they used to cut an animal in half when making a covenant and walk between the halves.</i> Observe, the word <i>avar</i> (passed) minus the <i>bet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Following it.</i> has the opposite meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>avar</i> preceding <i>brit</i> means to violate the covenant.

THIS CURSE. This curse refers to <i>Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image</i> (Deut. 27:15).
THAT HE BLESS HIMSELF IN HIS HEART. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, of blessed memory, says <i>that he bless himself</i> is to be taken according to its plain meaning. When he hears the curse he will bless himself in his heart and say I shall have peace. In other words, when he hears the ban<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The curse.</i> he will say it will not fall on me but upon someone else.
THAT…BE SWEPT AWAY. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, who rests in paradise, says that the word <i>sefot</i> (swept away) means to extirpate. Compare, <i>tispeh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Both words come from the root <i>samekh, peh, heh</i>.</i> [thou (wilt) sweep away] in <i>Wilt Thou indeed sweep away</i> (Gen. 18:23).

Compare, <i>For he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water</i> (Jer. 17:8). The wicked are called dry. Compare, <i>For he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>, v. 6). The wicked person thinks that the blessing which he utters in his heart will also stop the curse. He explained well were it not that the word <i>ravah</i> (well watered) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As is <i>tzeme’ah</i> (dry). The point is that Rabbi Judah’s interpretation requires that nouns, not adjectives, be employed in our verse, for according to his interpretation the verse speaks of people. Filwarg argues that Rabbi Judah’s interpretation requires a noun because the dry and the watered are metaphors for curses and blessing, which are nouns. He interprets in this manner because later on I.E. himself interprets the dry and the watered as referring to people. The problem with Filwarg’s interpretation is that I.E. quotes Rabbi Judah as saying, “The righteous are called watered…The wicked are called dry.”</i> Our text should have read, <i>ravi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">A noun.</i> <i>et ha-tzama</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">A noun.</i> (the well watered…with the dry). Rabbi Jonah the grammarian<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Jonah ibn Janach.</i> says that it means<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>that he blesses himself in his heart…that the watered are swept away with the dry</i>.</i> because the corrupt sees the righteous<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The watered.</i> destroyed along with the wicked<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The dry.</i> he therefore thinks evil in his heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Jonah’s interpretation of <i>that he bless himself in his heart</i>. The wicked person says I might as well be wicked, for both the righteous and the wicked suffer one fate. They are both swept away.</i> However, this is incorrect because Scripture reads, <i>I shall have peace</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>That he blesses himself in his heart</i> implies that he says something positive to himself. However, there is nothing positive in saying the righteous and I will be swept away.</i> In my opinion the word <i>sefot</i> (swept) means to add. Compare, <i>sefot chattat</i> (add sin) (Is. 30:1). The added sin is the wicked person’s statement, I shall have peace even though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart. I will live because of the righteousness of the righteous, for the pious are many and I am an individual sinner.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>the watered be swept away with the dry</i>. A nation is judged by the majority of its people. The wicked believe that the merit of the majority, who are righteous, will protect the sinners, who are a minority.</i> Scripture therefore afterwards reads, <i>The Lord will not be willing to pardon him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>selo’ach lo</i>.</i> <i>but then…</i> (v. 19). The meaning of the latter is he shall immediately be destroyed. This verse is also proof of my interpretation of <i>and he shall be forgiven</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hebrew, ve-nislach lo</i>. According to I.E. the word <i>salach</i> means to delay punishment. See I.E. on Num. 14:19, “Selach refers to being slow to anger.”</i> (Num. 15:28). The meaning of <i>sefot</i> is that the well watered will add to the dry. Scripture compares the righteous to the well watered, as in <i>And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water</i> (Ps. 1:3). It compares the wicked to the dry. Compare, <i>For he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert</i> (Jer. 17: 6). The fact that Scripture at first reads, <i>a root that beareth gall and wormwood</i> (v. 17), is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">That dry refers to the wicked.</i> It is in a dry place.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>root that beareth gall and wormwood</i> grows in parched land. Hence the wicked person is called the dry (Meijler, Krinsky). I.E.’s interpretation presents a problem. He interprets “the watered and the dry” as referring to people. However, earlier I.E. rejects Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi’s interpretation for this very reason. As noted above, Filwarg attempts to justify I.E.’s position. However, his interpretation is forced.</i>

Verse 19

THE ANGER OF THE LORD…SHALL BE KINDLED.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>yeshan</i> (literally, shall smoke). Our clause literally reads, the anger of the Lord…shall smoke. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> The fire of God’s anger shall bum him to the point where the smoke will be visible. Observe, if the sinner be an individual he will die immediately, and if it is a family <i>all the curse…shall lie upon him</i>. This means that the curse shall lie upon the family until its name is eradicated. If the sinner be a tribe, <i>the Lord shall separate him unto evil</i> (v. 20).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>The anger of the Lord…shall be kindled against that man</i> refers to an individual; <i>and all the curse…shall lie upon him</i> refers to a family; <i>and the Lord shall separate him unto evil</i> refers to a tribe.</i> Similarly <i>And I will offer it up for a burnt-offering</i> (Jud. 11:31), as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">We no longer have I.E.’s commentary on Judges. However, Radak in his comments on Judges notes that the <i>vav</i> there has the meaning of or. It appears that I.E. interpreted similarly.</i>

Verse 28

THE SECRET THINGS. The reference is to one who serves idols in secret.
BELONG UNTO THE LORD OUR GOD. Its meaning is that his punishment is in the hands of God, and the Lord will exact punishment from him. However, if the sin was committed in public there is an obligation on us and our children to do in accordance with that which is written in the Torah. Others say<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">That the meaning of our verse is.</i> that the secret and the revealed things belong to God. It is incumbent upon us only to observe the words of the Torah. Now this interpretation has no head or foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">It makes no sense and has no legs to stand on.</i> What reason is there to mention this here?<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">It does not continue the thought of the previous verse.</i> Scripture states that if you <i>return unto the Lord</i> (Deut. 30:2), <i>God will turn thy captivity</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>, v. 3) even though you are outside of the land because it stated earlier, <i>and cast them into another land</i> (v. 27). According to Rabbi Judah<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Judah Chayuj.</i> the first grammarian, the meaning of <i>ve-shav</i> (then shall turn) (Deut. 30:3) means God will give rest;<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Num. 10:36 (Vol. 4, p. 75). Rabbi Judah renders <i>God will turn thy captivity</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>, v. 3) as God will give rest to your captivity.</i> that is, he will give rest to the captives and be merciful to them, and after this He will return and gather.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Your captivity. It should be noted that Rabbi Judah renders the first <i>ve-shav</i> in 30:3 as will He give rest, and the second <i>ve-shav</i> as and will He return.</i>

In other words, God is the first cause who gave man the power to circumcise his heart. Since all things can be traced back to God, God can be said to “circumcise” man’s heart. <i>And the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart</i> seems to indicate that man has no free will, for it implies that God will change man’s nature so that he will no longer sin. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> After saying, you shall return unto the Lord and listen to His voice,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of the opening of verse 6.</i> Moses says that unlike the circumcision of the flesh, which you are obligated to execute, God will help you and will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed.

AS HE REJOICED OVER THY FATHERS. Who inherited the land, for Scripture addresses those who were exiled from it.

Verse 10

WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK OF THE LAW.

Verse 11

TOO HARD. The word <i>niflet</i> (too hard) means concealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi.</i> Or its meaning is, wondrous, that is, something that will cause you to grow weary while trying to accomplish it.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, too hard.</i>

Verse 12

IT IS NOT IN HEAVEN. This explains <i>niflet</i> (too hard) (v. 11).

Verse 13

BEYOND THE SEA. This explains <i>neither is it far off</i> (v. 11). It is possible that the reference is to the great sea<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Atlantic Ocean.</i> whose width a person cannot enter<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">That is, one cannot cross it.</i> because of the darkness of the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A dark cloud covers it.

For the heart is the core of the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The commandments that pertain to the heart are the most important ones.

Verse 15

LIFE. Long life.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A person must ultimately die. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i>

Death and evil are the reverse of the above.

Note, <i>Then thou shalt live</i> explains the term <i>life</i> (v. 15).
AND MULTIPLY. This explains <i>and good</i> (v. 15), for it refers to material increase,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, an increase in bodies.</i> that is, in children and in wealth.

Verse 17

BUT IF THY HEART TURN AWAY. For the heart is most important.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it personifies the entire human being.</i>
BUT SHALT BE DRAWN AWAY. I have previously explained the meaning of <i>ve-niddachta</i> (but shall be drawn away).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 4:19.</i>

Verse 18

THAT YE SHALL SURELY PERISH. This explains <i>death and evil</i> (v. 15), for they and their children and their wealth shall perish.
YE SHALL NOT PROLONG YOUR DAYS. The reverse of <i>the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land</i> (v. 16).

Verse 19

HEAVEN AND EARTH. For they endure.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">From generation to generation.</i> Similarly with regard to <i>this stone shall be a witness against us</i> (Josh. 24:27) and <i>Hear, O ye mountains, the Lord’s controversy</i> (Micah 6:2).

Verse 15

AND THE LORD APPEARED IN THE TENT. The specified tent.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The tent of meeting mentioned in the previous verse.

Scripture therefore reads, <i>which I swore unto them</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Moses uses the term “I” because he was speaking for God by God’s command.</i> After this came the passage <i>Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers</i> (v. 16).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the sequence of events was as follows: Verses 14,15; 23; 16-22; 9.

AFTER THE FOREIGN GODS OF THE LAND. We know that God is one.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">God is unchangeable.

Thus God’s decrees remain unchangeable.</i> God does not change His works,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The laws of nature, or any of His actions.</i> for they are executed in wisdom.

Hence certain laws have to be followed in the Land of Israel if the land is to maintain its sanctity and receive the amount of divine influence allotted to it. See I.E. on Gen. 4:14; 28:16. Also see Ex. 15:17.</i> Scripture therefore reads, <i>the manner of the God of the land</i> (II Kings 17:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the people whom the king of Assyria brought to Samaria.

[AMONG THEM.] <i>Be-kirbo</i> (among them) refers to <i>foreign</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">That is, foreign people. Our verse reads, <i>and go astray after the foreign gods of the land, whither they go to he among them</i>. I.E. does not believe that Scripture would use the term “among them” when referring to foreign gods, for such gods do not exist, and it is impossible to come among them.

Verse 18

[AND I WILL SURELY HIDE.] The meaning of <i>And I will surely hide</i> is, if they call Me, I will not answer. Scripture compares God to a person who does not see or know what is happening. It is the custom of Scripture to employ two verbs.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>haster astir</i> (I will surely hide). Literally, hide, I will hide.</i> Those who know grammar understand this.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">That it is biblical style to employ an infinitive followed by a conjugated verb.</i>
IN THAT THEY ARE TURNED. This,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Idol worship.</i> as I previously explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 16.</i> is the great evil. There is no evil which tops it.

Verse 19

NOW…WRITE THIS. A commandment that Moses, and all who know how to write,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kitvu</i> (write) is in the plural. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> should write it.
AND TEACH THOU IT. Explain to them the difficult meanings.
PUT IT IN THEIR MOUTHS. That they should be able to recite it orally.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, that they should be proficient in it.</i> 
The words <i>ve-lammedah</i> (and teach thou it) and also <i>simah</i> (put it) are irregular, for grammatically the <i>heh</i> of <i>ve-lammedah</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> and the <i>lamed</i> with a <i>segol</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Our word should have read <i>ve-lamdeha</i> rather than <i>ve-lammedah</i>. Similarly <i>simah</i> should have read <i>simeha</i>.</i>
A WITNESS…AGAINST THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This meaning of our verse is tied to <i>For when I shall have brought them</i> (v. 20).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse and the next one form one unit. The verses are to be read as follows: <i>Now…write ye this song…that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel</i> (v. 19), <i>For when I shall have brought them into the land…</i> The song that is being discussed in these verses is the song in the following chapter.</i> It is also possible that our verse is independent,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our verse is not tied to the verse that follows.</i> because Scripture states, <i>ve-anetah</i> (that…shall testify) (v. 21).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, verse 20 opens a new thought and is tied to verse 21. The verses are to be read: <i>For when I shall have brought them into the land…</i>(v. 20) <i>that this song shall testify before them</i> (v. 21).</i> <i>Ve-anetah</i> (that…shall testify) is similar to <i>ta’aneh</i> (bear)<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">That is, testify. In other words, <i>ve-anetah</i> does not mean will answer but rather will testify.</i> in <i>thou shalt not bear…against thy neighbor</i> (Ex. 20: 13). The song, as it were, will testify before those who ask, “Why did all this happen to us?”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The song will explain to all why what occurred came to pass.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

BEFORE THEM. <i>Le-fanav</i> means before them. It means that the witness will not be removed from before them but shall always be with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Israel shall always have a copy of the song with them.</i>
FOR I KNOW THEIR IMAGINATION. For even if I did not know the future,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Supernaturally.</i> I know what they have done until this day.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">And on this basis can surmise how they will act in the future.</i>

Verse 22

THE SAME DAY. Moses did not tarry in doing this thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In committing the song to writing.</i> It is possible that this took place on the day he died, which was after writing the words of the Torah, for Moses wrote the song with it.

Verse 23



Verse 24

UNTIL THEY WERE FINISHED. This is connected to <i>the words</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the plural “they were finished.”</i>

Verse 25

THAT MOSES COMMANDED THE LEVITES. Scripture is being brief.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The Levites is short for the kohanim, the Levites</i>.</i> Our verse, as it were, says, the earlier-mentioned Levites who are <i>kohanim</i>, but not all the Levites, for they do not touch the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord</i>.</i>
[THAT BORE THE ARK OF THE CONVENT OF THE LORD.] By command. There are many such instances.

Verse 26

IT MAY BE THERE FOR A WITNESS AGAINST THEE. Moses speaks to all of Israel. The <i>kohanim</i> are included when he speaks to Israel. However, when Moses addressed the Reubenites and the Gadites he spoke to them alone, as I previously explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 3:18.</i>

Verse 27

AND HOW MUCH MORE AFTER MY DEATH. In addition, I know that after my death…<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">You will rebel. According to I.E., <i>ve-af ki achare moti</i> (and how much more after my death) means, and how much more after my death will you rebel.</i> for God told me, <i>and this people will rise up, and go astray</i> (v. 16) after you sleep with your fathers. This is what <i>after my death</i> refers to.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">After my death you will rebel.</i> 

Verse 28



Verse 29

[BEFALL YOU.] The meaning of <i>ve-karata</i> (and…will befall you) is similar to <i>ve-chatat</i> (but the fault is) in <i>but the fault is in thine people</i> (Ex. 5:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Both words are perfects which become imperfects because of the conversive <i>vav</i>.</i> It is explained there.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 5:16 (Vol. 2, p. 123).</i>

Chapter 32



Verse 1

GIVE EAR. I have previously explained in my book<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Moznayim</i> (Weiser).</i> that the word <i>ha’azinu</i> (give ear) is related to the word <i>ozen</i> (ear). Scripture, as it were, says incline your ear.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., pay attention.</i> 
I have previously informed you<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Deut. 3:24. However, I.E. does not there mention Rabbi Saadiah Gaon by name.</i> that the Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> says that the meaning of <i>heavens</i> is the angels and the meaning of the <i>earth</i> is the people of the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon renders our verse: Give ear, O inhabitants of heaven, and I will speak, And let the people of the earth hear the words of my mouth.</i> On the other hand, its meaning might be that the rain that comes down from heaven and the fruit which the earth produces are called to bear witness.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi: “If Israel will act worthily, the witnesses will come and give them their reward…the ground will give its increase, the heavens will bestow its dew.” Rashi’s interpretation is based on the <i>Sifre</i>.</i> I believe that the correct interpretation is that Moses called heaven and earth to witness because they last forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, heaven and earth do not refer to angels and people, or rain and the produce of the earth.</i> Similarly <i>Hear, O ye mountains</i> (Micah 6:2) and also Joshua’s stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Josh. 24:27: <i>And Joshua said…‘Behold, this stone shall be a witness…for it hath heard all the words of the Lord…’</i></i> Scripture there writes that the stone heard. I have hinted to you that man’s soul is intermediary between the upper and lower worlds.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Man’s soul comes from the middle world. See I.E. on Ex. 19:20 (Vol. 2, p. 338). For the upper, middle, and lower worlds, see I.E. on Ex. 3:15 (Vol. 2, pp. 86-90).</i> The soul compares all things to its body.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, its palace. The body serves as a “palace” for the soul. The mind explains reality by employing figures of speech based on the body. For example, the earth opened her mouth, etc.</i> It certainly does so when speaking to other human beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, other inhabitants of the palace.</i> It therefore elevates the low and lowers the high.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:26 (Vol. 1, p. 45). “Now a human being cannot speak of things above or below without employing human terminology. Hence Scripture uses such terms as the mouth of the earth (Num. 16:30), <i>the hand of the Jordan</i> (Num. 13:29).” Also see I.E. on Ex. 19:20 (Vol. 2, pp. 388,389).</i>

Verse 2

SHALL DROP. The word <i>ya’arof</i> (shall drop) is related to the word <i>ya’arof</i> (he will break down) in <i>He will break down their altars</i> (Hos. 10:2). The meaning of <i>ya’arof</i> (shall drop) is will come down.
MY DOCTRINE. <i>Likchi</i> (My doctrine) refers to that which one will take away<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>lakach</i> means took. The noun <i>lekech</i> thus means a taking.</i> from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Learn from Moses.</i> It means a lesson. Compare, <i>lekech</i> (doctrine) in <i>For I give you a good doctrine</i> (Prov. 4:2).
AS THE SMALL RAIN. I believe that <i>se’irim</i> (small rain) refers to light rain.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For it stands in contrast to <i>revivim</i> (showers), which refers to a heavy rain.</i>
AND AS THE SHOWERS. The word <i>revivim</i> (showers) is related to the word <i>rav</i> (numerous). They<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Se’irim</i> (small rain) and <i>revivim</i> (showers).</i> are adjectives. The fact that <i>esev</i> (herb) is stronger than <i>deshe</i> (tender grass) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>se’irim</i> (small rain) refers to light rain and <i>revivim</i> (showers) to a heavy rain, for Scripture speaks of <i>se’irim</i> falling on <i>deshe</i> and <i>revivim</i> on <i>esev</i>.</i> Some say that <i>se’irim</i> (small rain) is related to <i>sa’ar</i> (hair).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to raindrops as thin as hair.</i> Others say that it is related to the word <i>sa’arat</i> (storm of)<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, <i>se’irim</i> (small rain) means a rainstorm.</i> in <i>storm of God</i> (Jer. 30:23) even though <i>se’irim</i> is spelled with a <i>sin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">And <i>sa’arah</i> (storm) with a <i>samekh</i>.</i> Similarly, the phrase <i>ve-yista’er alav</i> (shall come against him like a whirlwind) (Dan. 11:40), which is spelled with a <i>sin</i>, means the same as <i>ve-yista’er alav</i> spelled with a <i>samekh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The word for storm is usually spelled with a <i>samekh</i>.</i> It is also possible that the word <i>se’irim</i> has no brother in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is to be ascertained from its context.</i> Our verse repeats itself<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>My speech…repeats My doctrine…; As the small rain</i>…repeats <i>And the showers…</i></i> for emphasis, as is the style in all prophecies. The essence of our verse is that Moses prayed that his words be like dew and rain which, as it is written, do not return unfulfilled<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Is. 55:11.</i> but water the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 55:10</i> The meaning of the latter is that Moses’ words should enter the hearts of those who hear them in the same way that the rain affects the earth and fructifies it and causes it to produce plants.

Verse 3

ASCRIBE YE GREATNESS. This is addressed to the heavens and the earth, as Scripture states, <i>The heavens declare the glory of God</i> (Ps. 19:2), which is to be understood in accordance with my interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Those who study astronomy realize how great God is. It is in the latter sense that the heavens declare God’s glory. See I.E. on Ps. 19:2.</i> Similarly <i>Let the heavens and earth praise Him</i> (Ps. 69:35). 

Verse 4

[THE ROCK, HIS WORK IS PERFECT.] Moses opens with this phrase to make it known that all that befell Israel did so because of their evil deeds. 
The meaning of <i>The Rock</i> is that God, like a rock, is everlasting. Do not be amazed at this,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">That Scripture compares God to a rock.</i> for Scripture similarly states, <i>The Lord…shall roar like a lion</i> (Hos. 11:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Scripture compares God to mundane objects.</i> Scripture does this because one who speaks cannot compare God’s work to anything but His works, for everything is His work. Rock, in <i>But God is the rock of my heart</i> (Ps. 73:26), similarly means a support, might, and permanence. Others say that <i>tzur</i> (rock) is related to the word <i>tzurah</i> (image). Compare, <i>tzuram</i> (their form) in <i>And their form shall be for the nether-world</i> (Ps. 49:15). Its basic meaning is that God does not consist of matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>etzem</i>.</i> which can be molded into a form.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">According to medieval philosophy everything on earth consists of matter and form.</i> On the contrary, He is Primary form.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">He does not consist of matter. According to this interpretation our clause should be rendered, The Primary form, for all His ways are justice.</i> The first interpretation appears correct to me.
HIS WORK IS PERFECT. All the works of an artisan are incomplete<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A human being’s work is not perfect.</i> because the artisan needs the assistance of one greater than he.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The work of an artisan or an author can always be improved upon. Furthermore, most artisans need assistance. Hence what they alone produce can never be perfect.</i> The work of God alone is perfect. Everything is a duality<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Matter and form. Some versions read, everything is in flux.</i> except for the creator of all.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">God does not consist of matter and form.</i>
FOR ALL HIS WAYS ARE JUSTICE. His ways do not change.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The laws of nature are unchangeable.</i> On the contrary, they follow one law.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">They are eternal.</i> This is the praise of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">That God’s works are unchangeable. This is what Moses means by <i>ascribe ye greatness unto our God</i> (v. 3).</i> All those who are created change their deeds in accordance with their needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">People change their behavior in accordance with their needs. However, God is unchangeable.</i> God’s works<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The working of the universe. See Chapter 12 of the <i>Yesod Mora</i>.</i> were done for His glory,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The world reflects God’s glory. See Ps. 19:1, <i>The heavens declare the glory of God</i>.</i> with might<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Some editions read: God’s works alone were done in might. Creation was a mighty act. Compare the blessing recited upon hearing thunder: “Whose might and power fill the world.” Also see Ps. 29:1, <i>Ascribe unto the Lord glory and strength</i>.</i> and wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they are unchanging. See Job 12:13, <i>With Him is wisdom and might</i>. Some editions read: God’s works alone were done in might in accordance with wisdom.</i> The standing still of the sun (Josh. 10:12)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Which appears to have entailed a suspension of the laws of nature.</i> is no argument to the contrary because, as I explained in its place,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s commentary on the Book of Joshua is no longer extant.</i> its secret is clear, from the clause <i>And thou, Moon in the valley of Aijalon</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See Ralbag on Josh. 10:12. Ralbag was bothered by the issue raised by I.E. According to Ralbag the meaning of Josh. 10:12 is, may Israel defeat its enemies while the sun is still over Gibeon and the moon over the valley of Aijalon. Perhaps I.E. interpreted similarly.</i>
A GOD OF FAITHFULNESS AND WITHOUT INIQUITY. God alone has true might,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The term used for God in our clause is <i>El</i>. <i>El</i> means mighty. (See I.E. on Ex. 3:15). Hence I.E.’s comment on God’s might.</i> for all the might of the mighty is an “accident;”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Accident in Aristotelian philosophy refers to a quality which is not part of the essence of a being. For example, color is said to be an accident, for the color of an object is not part of its essence.</i> that is, it depends on outside sources.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">No king or ruler is autonomous. His power is dependent on the will of his underlings.</i> The meaning of our clause is, it is not possible that God does iniquity because He is a God of faithfulness.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads <i>ve-en avel</i> (and without iniquity). The literal meaning <i>of ve-en avel</i> is, and no iniquity. According to this interpretation, and no iniquity means and God does no iniquity.</i> It is possible that <i>ve-en avel</i> (and without iniquity) means and without iniquity in His ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, and no iniquity is short for, and no iniquity in his ways.</i> On the other hand, it is possible that the word <i>El</i> (God) is to be read as if written twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Our clause is to be read: A God of faithfulness, not a God of iniquity. According to this interpretation, <i>ve-en avel</i> is to be interpreted as if written, <i>ve-en El avel</i>.</i>
JUST AND RIGHT IS HE. Since Scripture states <i>shichet lo</i> (is corruption His) (v. 5),<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shichet</i> literally means he destroyed. I.E. renders <i>shichet lo</i> as He destroyed that which belonged to Him, that is Israel.</i> it says a perverse people corrupted God’s righteousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Israel corrupted God’s righteous ways by sinning..</i> Look, God alone is right.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">God destroyed the perverse. Hence his act of destruction was not unjust.</i> The rightness of the right is to fix that which is crooked.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">By punishing the wicked. Hence what God did to Israel was not unjust.</i> The word <i>lo</i> (v. 5) therefore refers to what He had at first.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>shichet lo</i> means He destroyed what was His, that is, Israel. According to I. E. the word <i>lo</i>, which usually means him, is to be interpreted as <i>shelo</i> (his).</i>

Verse 5

NO; HIS CHILDREN’S IS THE BLEMISH. <i>Lo banav</i> (no, his children’s) means those who say that they are not his children. Scripture similarly states, <i>Children in whom is no faithfulness</i> (v. 20). Its meaning is that they do not admit that God created them. Although they might profess their belief verbally, they do not believe it in their hearts. The fact that they do not fear God<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture declares them to be a crooked and perverse generation.</i> is proof of their lack of belief. The <i>lamed</i> of <i>lo</i> (his) serves itself and another word along with it. It is to be prefixed to the word <i>mumam</i> (the blemish).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mumam</i> is to be read <i>le-mumam</i>. The entire clause is to be interpreted as if written, <i>lo banav le-mumam</i>.</i> The meaning of <i>lemumam</i> is, because of their blemish, their blemish consisting in being <i>A generation crooked and perverse</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">According to this opinion our verse should be interpreted: God destroyed what originally belonged to Him, that is, those who, because of their blemish (which consists in their being a generation perverse and crooked), say that they are not His children.</i>
AND PERVERSE. The meaning of <i>u-fetaltol</i> (and perverse) is he grows strong and triumphant in his crookedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>ikkesh u-fetaltol</i> (a crooked and perverse) as crooked and triumphant. Hence his interpretation.</i> Compare the word <i>naftule</i> (wrestlings)<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Petaltol</i> (perverse) and <i>naftule</i> (wrestlings) come from the same root, <i>nun, peh, lamed</i>.</i> in <i>with mighty wrestlings</i> (Gen. 30:8). Some say that the meaning of <i>shichet lo</i> (is corruption His) is, they corrupted themselves; that is, they corrupted their souls. Do not wonder that the singular <i>lo</i> is employed,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas the rest of the verse refers to Israel in the plural.</i> for this is the style of the language. Can you not see that Scripture reads, <i>Remember</i> (zekhor)<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zekhor</i> is singular.</i> <i>the days of old, Consider</i> (binu)<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Binu</i> is singular.</i> <i>the years of many generations</i> (v. 7). I believe that <i>shichet lo</i> (is corruption His) means they corrupted God;<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>shichet lo</i> is, they corrupted to him.</i> that is, they corrupted the ways of God, which are implanted in man’s mind,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Those laws of the Torah which are based on reason. See I.E. on Ex. 20:1 (Vol. 2, p. 407).</i> as well as the statutes which He commanded. Scripture, as it were, says the crooked generation that is not His children corrupted Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">His ways.</i> This is their blemish. The verse that follows, namely, <i>Do you thus requite the Lord</i>, is proof that this is its interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">For the verse speaks of harming God, as it were.</i> I have explained the meaning of the <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The rules of the interrogative <i>heh</i>. The next verse opens with an interrogative <i>heh</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> in the book entitled <i>Moznayim</i>.

Verse 6

FOOLISH. In their deeds.
AND UNWISE. In heart. Look, the entire people are totally deficient in thought and deed.
THY FATHER. Scripture states this because it earlier stated that they are not His children.
THAT HATH GOTTEN THEE. <i>Kanekha</i> (gotten thee) is similar to <i>kanani</i> (made me)<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Or gotten me.</i> in <i>The Lord made me</i> (Prov. 8:22).
HE…MADE THEE. Fully developed you.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tikken</i>. According to I.E. the word may have the meaning of fixing in final form. See I.E. on Gen. 2:4 (Vol. 1, p. 51). According to I.E. this probably means that God saw to it that you reached maturity.</i>
AND ESTABLISHED THEE.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>va-yekhoneka</i>. I.E. renders this, and prepared you.</i> For full development.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">God nurtured Israel so that they would reach the stage of maturity. I.E. renders our verse: Is not He your father that acquired you. He saw to it that you developed and prepared you for development.</i>

Verse 7

THE DAYS OF. <i>Yemot</i> (days of) and <i>yeme</i> (days of) are two forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Two forms in the plural construct of the word <i>yom</i> (day).</i> The same is the case with <i>shenot</i> (years of) and <i>shene</i> (years of).<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Two forms in the plural construct of the word <i>shanah</i> (year).</i>
OF OLD. <i>Olam</i> (of old) means the time that has past.
ASK THY FATHER. Scripture states this because it earlier<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">At the opening of the verse.</i> said <i>Remember</i>. If you forgot what your fathers told you, ask them.
AND HE WILL DECLARE UNTO THEE. <i>Ve-yaggedekha</i> means and he will declare unto thee.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The suffix <i>kha</i> means unto thee. The <i>kha</i> ending usually indicates the accusative (you or thee). Thus <i>ve-yagaddekha</i> would appear to mean, and He will declare you. Hence I.E. points out that here it means will declare to you.</i> Compare, <i>netattani</i> (thou hast given to me)<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The suffix <i>ni</i> is usually the sign of the accusative. Compare <i>channani</i> (Gen. 33:11). Thus we would ordinarily render, <i>netattani</i>, you have given me. Hence I.E. points out that here it has the meaning of you have given to me. We thus see that at times accusative suffixes are not to be rendered literally.</i> in <i>for that thou hast given to me in the Southland</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> (Josh. 15:19). And <i>yetzauni</i> (are gone forth of me) in <i>My children are gone forth of me</i> (Jer. 10:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Here too an accusative ending is not to be rendered as an accusative, for <i>yetzauni</i> is to be rendered as gone forth of me, not gone forth me.</i>
THINE ELDERS. Scripture repeats itself, for it is elegant to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thine elders</i>…repeats the idea of <i>Ask thy father…</i></i>

Verse 8

WHEN THE MOST HIGH GAVE TO THE NATIONS THEIR INHERITANCE. The commentaries<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi and Rashbam.</i> say that the reference is to “the generation of the dispersion”<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The generation that was involved in building the tower of Babel. See Gen. 11:1-9.</i> when all the earth became inhabited.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 11:8,9.</i> God at that time decreed that the land of the seven nations should belong to Israel, as this land would be large enough for them. Scripture therefore reads, <i>According to the number of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">God set aside the land of the seven nations for the Jews because it was suitable for Israel’s population.</i>
HE SET. Some say that <i>yatzev</i> (he set) is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yatzev</i> appears to be a third person imperfect, meaning he will set. The verbs <i>be-hanchel</i> (When…gave the nations their inheritance) and <i>be-hafrido</i> (When He separated) which precede <i>yatzev</i> are infinitives.

Verse 9

THE LOT. <i>Chevel</i> (lot) means a section.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>chevel</i> is a cord.

A section is so called because land is measured with a cord.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>chevel</i> refers to a portion of land measured by a line, to which one is assigned by lot.</i>

Verse 10

HE FOUND HIM. The reference is to <i>thy father that hath gotten thee</i> (v. 6).<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>He</i> refers to <i>thy father</i> (God).</i> 
The meaning of <i>He found him</i> is that God’s glory entered into the desert with them.

HE COMPASSED HIM ABOUT. The reference is to the clouds.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Clouds of glory which surrounded the camp of Israel (Krinsky).</i>
HE CARED FOR HIM. By giving him the Torah.
HE KEPT HIM. From the enemies.
AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE. I have previously explained the meaning of <i>ishon</i> (apple).<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear where.</i> 
Scripture speaks as humans do when it says His eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">For God has no eye.</i> It means that God protected them from all enemies and all that lay in wait.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">To ambush them.</i>

Verse 11

AS AN EAGLE THAT STIRRETH UP HER NEST. <i>Ya’ir</i> (stirreth up) is a transitive verb.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">The verb can also be taken as intransitive and the verse interpreted as stating, as an eagle stirs itself [to guard] its nest. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It means He leads them from place to place.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Just as an eagle leads its eaglets.</i>
HER YOUNG. <i>Gozalav</i> means her young. The word <i>gozal</i> (a young pigeon) in <i>and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon</i> (Gen. 15:9) is similar. The word <i>gozal</i>, along with the term <i>efrochim</i> (young birds), is a general term.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to all kinds of baby birds.</i> It is similar to the term <i>tzippor</i> (bird).<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a general term for birds.</i>
HOVERETH. When they journey.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">When the baby birds journey, the mother bird hovers over them.</i> <i>Yerachef</i> (hovereth) is related to the word <i>merachefet</i> (hovered) (Gen. 1:2).

SPREADETH ABROAD HER WINGS, TAKETH THEM.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>yissa’ehu</i> (literally, takes it).

This is the meaning of our verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse speaks of weakness. The baby bird personifies Israel’s weakness and God’s care for it.</i> However, the meaning of <i>how I bore you on eagles’ wings</i> (Ex. 19:4) is connected to <i>and brought you unto Myself</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). It means that Israel went out with a high hand<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">They rode on eagles’ wings.</i> and came quickly to Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to our verse, being carried on eagles’ wings in Ex. 19:4 does not connote weakness.</i> It is similar in meaning to <i>Who are these that fly as a cloud</i> (Is. 60:8).

Verse 12

THE LORD ALONE DID LEAD THEM. <i>Adonai badad</i> (the Lord alone) means only the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>badad</i> (alone) refers to God.</i> Its meaning is<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">That the Lord alone did lead them.</i> similar to <i>At the commandment of the</i> Lord<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Alone.</i> <i>they encamped, and at the commandment of the Lord</i><sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Alone.</i> <i>they journeyed</i> (Num. 9:23). God had no associate. It is possible that the word <i>badad</i> (alone) refers to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">In this case we should render our clause: the Lord did lead them (Israel) alone; that is, He never led any other people.</i> Compare, <i>Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone</i> (Num. 23:9).
AND THERE WAS NO STRANGE GOD WITH HIM. With Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Him</i> refers to Israel, not to God.</i> <i>They roused Him to jealousy with strange gods</i> (v. 16) is proof that this interpretation is correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">For verse 16 compares Israel’s future sins with their past faithfulness.</i>

Verse 13

HE MADE HIM RIDE ON THE HIGH PLACES OF THE EARTH. The land of Canaan, which is in the center of the inhabited world. <i>He made him ride</i> is metaphorical. 
The reading of the word <i>bamote</i> (high places) does not change because of the <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> is silent, for the vowel is beneath the <i>mem</i> which precedes it.</i> It is related to the word <i>bamotemo</i><sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Here the <i>vav</i> serves as a <i>cholam</i>.</i> (their high places) (Deut. 33:29). The word <i>bemotav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-motav</i> is connected to the word <i>mavet</i> (death). Its <i>bet</i> is a preposition. It has nothing to do with the word <i>bamot</i>, which means a high place.</i> (with…his tomb) in <i>the wicked</i><sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 53:9 reads, <i>And they made his grave with the wicked, And with the rich his tomb</i>. I.E. apparently quoted from memory.</i>…<i>with…his tomb</i> (Is. 53:9) is not related to our word.
FRUITAGE. The word <i>tenuvot</i> (fruitage) means fruit. It is related to the word <i>yanuv</i> (increase) in <i>If riches increase</i> (Ps. 62:11).
FIELD. <i>Sadai</i> (field) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Modifying <i>tenuvot</i> (fruitage). The ending <i>ai</i> usually indicates a plural. Compare, <i>nashai</i> (my wives); <i>benotai</i> (my daughters); <i>banai</i> (my sons). Hence I.E.’s comments.</i> It follows the paradigm of <i>chakham</i> (wise).<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Both words are vocalized <i>kametz, kametz</i>.</i> The <i>yod</i> of <i>sadai</i> is in place of a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for field is <i>sadeh. Sadeh</i> is spelled with a <i>heh</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is similar to the <i>vav</i> of <i>shalev</i><sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav of shalev</i> is in place of a <i>vav</i>, for the root of <i>shalev</i> is <i>shin, lamed, heh</i>.</i> (at ease) in <i>I was at ease</i> (Job 16:12). The clause <i>ya’aloz sadai</i> (let the field exult) (Ps. 96:12) wherein <i>ya’aloz</i> is in the singular proves this.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>sadai</i> is singular, not plural.</i>
AND HE MADE HIM TO SUCK HONEY OUT OF THE CRAG. This is a metaphor. It is like <i>That the mountains shall drop down sweet wine</i><sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Which is not to be taken literally.</i> (Joel 4:18). The reference is to the abundance of honey and oil which, as is clearly stated in Scripture,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezek. 27:17.</i> were exported from the land of Canaan
OUT OF THE FLINTY ROCK. The <i>lamed</i> in <i>chalmish</i> (flinty) has no <i>dagesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it follows a <i>pattach</i>. Compare the word <i>challamish</i> (flint).</i> because the word is in the construct. <i>Me-chalmish tzur</i> (out of the flinty rock) is the reverse of <i>mi-tzur ha-challamish</i> (out of the rock of flint) (Deut. 8:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The order of <i>tzur</i> and <i>challamish</i> changes.

Verse 14

CURD OF KINE. An abundance of meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the term <i>chemah</i> (curd) is not to be taken literally.</i>

Our verse, which speaks of the fat of lambs, seems to support this contention.</i> which I mentioned in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 7:20.</i> On the other hand, fat in <i>with fat of lambs</i> means the fleshy and the good.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, fat is not to be taken literally.</i> Compare, <i>All the best</i> (chelev)<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the fat.</i> <i>of the oil</i> (Num. 18:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Here too fat is not to be taken literally.</i>
OF THE BREED OF BASHAN. Who were raised in the mountain of the Bashan.
WITH THE KIDNEY-FAT OF WHEAT.

AND OF THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE. The wine. The Land of Israel thus contains an abundance of honey, oil, meat, bread, wine, and all sorts of fruit. This is the meaning of <i>the fruitage of the field</i> (v. 13). Some say that honey refers to date honey.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 2:11.</i>
FOAMING WINE. The word <i>chamer</i> (foaming wine) means wine. Compare, <i>kerem chemed</i> (a vineyard of foaming wine) (Is. 27:2).
[THOU DRANKEST FOAMING WINE.]<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tishteh chemer</i>.</i> The <i>tav</i> of the word <i>tishteh</i> (thou drinkest) is a second person<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">A second person masculine prefix. In other words, <i>tishteh</i> means you will drink. The word <i>tishteh</i> can also mean she will drink. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> prefix. Our verse, as it were, speaks like a person who tells his friend the land has so much wine that you will drink it at all times. Some say that <i>enav</i> (grape) is in the feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">And <i>tishteh</i> is in the third person feminine. According to this interpretation our verse reads, the blood of the grape will give you wine to drink.</i> However, what they say is worthless, for the <i>tav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>tishteh</i>.</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>pattach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">The word should have read <i>tashteh</i>, not <i>tishteh. Tishteh</i> means she will drink; <i>tashteh</i>, she will cause you to drink.</i> so that it would be a causative. Some say that <i>tishteh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation takes <i>tishteh</i> to be a third person feminine, meaning she will drink.</i> speaks of the community,<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Israel. Thus <i>tishteh chemer</i>, she (Israel) will drink wine.</i> for the word Israel is sometimes in the masculine and sometimes in the feminine. This interpretation is a bit closer to the correct meaning. 

Verse 15

BUT JESHURUN WAXED FAT. Jeshurun refers to Israel. It is possible that the name <i>Jeshurun</i> is related to the word <i>yashar</i> (upright). Its meaning is, the one who was upright became fat. Some say that the word <i>Jeshurun</i> is related to the word <i>ashurennu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>shin</i>, <i>vav, resh</i>.</i> (I behold him) (Num. 23:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">In this case Jeshurun is a variant of <i>yasharu</i> and means those who behold, the reference being to God’s salvation or God’s glory (Weiser).</i> The first interpretation appears “upright” in my eyes. The fact that Jeshurun is in the singular<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yishman</i> (waxed fat), the verb governing Jeshurun is singular.</i> is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>va-yishman yeshurun</i> (but Yeshurun waxed fat) means, and the one who was upright grew fat, for according to the second interpretation Jeshurun is a variant of <i>yasharu</i> which is a plural.</i>
AND KICKED. The word <i>va-yivat</i> (and kicked) is similar to <i>tivatu</i> (kick ye) in <i>Wherefore kick ye</i> (I Sam. 2:29). Its meaning is to be ascertained from its context.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">It means to act disrespectfully. In Rabbinic literature <i>ba’at</i> means to kick.</i>
THOU DIDST WAX FAT. It did not enter their minds to take stock of themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Each one of the Israelites did not say to himself, <i>Thou didst wax fat, thou didst grow thick, thou didst become gross</i> (Krinsky). The first and last part of our verse is in the third person. The aforementioned is in the second person. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
THOU DIDST GROW THICK. The word <i>avita</i> (thou didst grow thick) is similar to the word <i>avah</i> (thicker) in <i>My little finger is thicker</i> (I Kings 12:10).
THOU DIDST BECOME GROSS. Some say that <i>kasita</i><sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Which is in the <i>kal</i> and is spelled with a <i>sin</i>.</i> (thou didst grow thick) is similar to <i>kissah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Which is in the <i>pi’el</i> and is spelled with a <i>samekh</i>.</i> (he hath covered) in <i>he hath covered his face with his fatness</i> (Job 15:27),<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>kasita</i> means you covered; that is, you covered your face with fat.</i> for the word is found in the <i>kal</i> conjugation.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Elsewhere in Scripture. See Prov. 12:23; Ps.32:l. According to this interpretation <i>kasita</i> comes from the root <i>kaf, samekh, heh</i>, with the <i>sin</i> substituted for a <i>samekh</i>.</i> Others say that <i>kasita</i> is similar to <i>ke-seh</i> (like…a sheep) in <i>I have gone astray like a lost sheep</i> (Ps. 119:176).<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">In this case the <i>kaf</i> of <i>kasita</i> is a preposition, the word itself comes from the word <i>seh</i> (sheep), and <i>kasita</i> means you became like a sheep.</i> We do not find such a construction in any of the verbs.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">A verb formed by combining a preposition and a noun.</i> It appears to me the word <i>kasita</i> has no brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Has no cognate in Scripture, for the root <i>kaf, sin, heh</i> is not found in Scripture.</i> Its meaning is, you kicked.
AND HE FORSOOK. The commandments of his God.

He caused this to be.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Israel, by sinning, “caused” God not to save him (Krinsky).</i> Scripture therefore continues, <i>the Rock of his salvation</i>, which is to be understood as <i>The Rock, His work is perfect</i> (v. 4).<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on verse 4.</i>

Verse 16

THEY ROUSED HIM.

He similarly punished Israel for believing in foreign gods.</i>
WITH STRANGE GODS. <i>Be-zarim</i> is to be interpreted as with strange gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-zarim</i> literally means with strange. The word gods is not in the text. Hence I.E.’s comments.</i>
WITH ABOMINATIONS. The reference is to idols.

Verse 17

DEMONS. <i>Shedim</i> (demons) has the same meaning as s<i>e’irim</i> (satyrs) in <i>the satyrs after whom they go astray</i> (Lev. 17:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 17:7. There he defines <i>se’irim</i> as demons. He explains the word as meaning to fear. They are called <i>se’irim</i> because all who see them are terrified.</i> Therefore Rabbi Isaac the son of Saul<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">An eleventh-century Sephardic poet, grammarian, and Bible commentator.</i> who rests in Eden says that the word <i>se’arum</i> (dreaded) in <i>Which your fathers dreaded not</i><sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse.</i> is related to the word <i>se’irim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">For the word <i>se’arum</i> means dreaded and <i>se’irim</i> means those who terrify.</i> The <i>lamed</i> of <i>la-shedim</i> (unto demons) pertains to <i>shedim</i> and also to another word.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">This line is to be interpreted as follows: Some say that the <i>lamed</i> of <i>lashedim</i> (unto demons) pertains to <i>shedim</i> and also to another word.</i> <i>La-shedim lo eloha</i> (unto demons, no-gods) is to be read as if written <i>la-shedim u-le-lo eloha</i> (unto demons and unto no-gods).<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">In this opinion there is no need for Scripture to explain that the demons are not gods.</i> I believe that there is no need for this interpretation.

They are called <i>shedim</i> in the same way that the Emim are called Emim.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the Emim are so called because they inspire fear. See Deut. 2:10.</i> They are called <i>shedim</i> because they destroy reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">By the fear which they inspire.

GODS THAT THEY KNEW NOT. How could Israel think that these gods were deities when they did not know these gods by proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Israel had no evidence that these gods exist.</i> This is the meaning of <i>they knew not</i>. Neither did they know them by tradition. This is what <i>Which your fathers dreaded not</i> refers to.
NEW GODS THAT CAME UP OF LATE. A few days ago. They are not ancient. Even their fathers did not know them.
DREADED. <i>Se’arum</i> means they were not in dread of them. <i>Se’arum</i> is related to the word <i>ve-yista’er</i> (shall come like a whirlwind) in <i>shall come against him like a whirlwind</i> (Dan. 11:40). It is similar in meaning to <i>sa’ar</i> in <i>That made the hair</i> (sa’arat)<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation apparently connects the word <i>se’arum</i> to the word <i>sa’ar</i> (hair). See Rashi, “<i>Se’arum</i> means they were not afraid of them, their hair (<i>sa’aratam</i>) did not stand up in fear of them. It is the nature of man’s hair to stand on end because of fear.”</i> <i>of my flesh to stand up</i> (Job 4:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-yista’er</i> means, and will frighten.

The same is true with <i>se’arum</i>, which is an intransitive verb with an accusative. It literally means were in dread you. However, it is to be rendered as were in dread of you.</i> Look, the meaning of <i>se’arum</i> is, they were not afraid of them.

Also, this clause,<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Like verse 4.</i> <i>the</i> <i>rock that begot thee</i>, is similar <i>to Look unto the rock whence ye were hewn</i> (Is. 51:1).

[THOU WAST UNMINDFUL.] The word <i>teshi</i> (thou wast unmindful) is related to the word <i>tinnasheh</i> (you will forget)<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, shin, heh</i>.</i> in [the clause] you shall not forget.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>lo tinnasheh</i>.

THAT BORE THEE. <i>Mecholelekha</i> means that bore thee. Observe, God who is powerful and mighty as a rock [gave birth to you]. It is possible that the word <i>mecholelekha</i> is related to the word <i>chil</i> (pain), as in <i>Like as a woman with child</i>, <i>that draweth near the time of her delivery, Is in pain</i> (tachil) (Is. 26:17).

HIS SONS AND HIS DAUGHTERS. Men and women, for they too <sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">The women.</i> sacrificed to the idols.

Verse 20

AND HE SAID. God in His heart or to the angels.
I WILL HIDE MY FACE. Scripture speaks as people do.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">For God has no face.</i> Similarly <i>I will hide Mine eyes from you</i> (Is. 1:15).

I WILL SEE WHAT THEIR END WILL BE. Some say that our verse is to be interpreted, <i>I will hide My face from them</i> because I see what they will ultimately do.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">That they will worship idols. According to this interpretation, <i>I will see what their end shall be</i> means [because] I see what they will ultimately do.</i> However, it is to be understood according to its literal meaning, that is, [so that] I will see what they will do when trouble comes upon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation, <i>I will see what their end shall be</i> means [so that] I see what they will do when trouble comes upon them.</i>

A VILE NATION. For a fool and a vile person lack understanding. He therefore kills and has no pity.

Verse 22

KINDLED. Their provocation, or that which they did,<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Kindled a fire in my nostril. According to this interpretation our verse reads: For a fire it kindled in My soul.</i> for we find the word <i>kadechah</i> (kindled) to be transitive, as in <i>For ye have kindled</i> (kedachtem) <i>a fire in My nostril</i> (Jer. 17:4). It is possible that <i>kadechah</i> means is kindled.<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, <i>kadechah</i> is intransitive.

All of this<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">The fire and what it does.</i> refers to God’s burning anger.
UNTO THE DEPTHS OF THE NETHER-WORLD. Its meaning is similar to that of <i>and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning</i> (Deut. 29:22).
AND DEVOURETH. Israel.
AND SETTETH ABLAZE. <i>Va-telahet</i> (and setteth ablaze)<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>va-telahet</i> means and setteth ablaze.</i> is related to the word <i>lahat</i> (flaming) in <i>and the flaming sword</i> (Gen. 3:24).
THE MOUNTAINS. The mountains of Israel.

Verse 23

I WILL HEAP. Some say that the word <i>aspeh</i> (I will heap) means I will add. However, it really means I will consume.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">So too Rashi in one interpretation.</i> Compare, <i>tispeh</i> (sweep away) in <i>Wilt Thou indeed sweep away</i> (Gen. 18:23).

Verse 24

THE WASTING OF HUNGER. <i>Meze ra’av</i> (the wasting of hunger) means burnt by hunger. <i>Meze</i> (wasting) is similar to <i>le-meze</i> (that they should heat) in <i>that they should heat the furnace</i> (Dan. 3:19).
AND THE DEVOURING OF THE FIERY BOLT. <i>Le-chume reshef</i> (the devouring of the fiery bolt) means consumed<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">Or eaten.

AND …DESTRUCTION. <i>Ketev</i> means destruction.
BITTER. <i>Meriri</i> (bitter) refers to bitterness in the air.

There are many such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">In which a verb is formed from the noun <i>lechem</i> (bread). See Prov. 23:1,6; Ps. 141:4.</i>
WITH THE VENOM OF CRAWLING THINGS OF THE DUST. The reference is to being bitten. Venom<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>chamat</i>, literally, anger of.</i> refers to being bitten.
[DUST.] This refers to fiery snakes.<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">Who crawl in the dust.</i> <i>Zochale</i> (crawling) is related to the word fear.<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zachal</i>.</i> They are called <i>zochale</i> because all who see them are afraid of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>zochale afar</i> (crawling things of the dust) literally means the scary of the dust.</i> It is similar to the term <i>emim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 17.</i> This is so because there are adjectives [without nouns].<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>zochale</i> is short for <i>nechashim zochale afar</i> (scary snakes that crawl on the ground).

Verse 25

BOTH YOUNG MAN. This<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">Both young men.</i> is connected to <i>Without shall the sword bereave</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than to what immediately comes before it.</i> Scripture reads <i>gam</i> (both)<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Our clause reads <i>gam bachur</i> (so young man).

Verse 26

I WOULD MAKE AN END OF THEM.

[I THOUGHT.] The meaning of <i>amarti</i> (I thought) is, I said to Myself. The Torah speaks as people do.

Verse 27

I DREADED. <i>Agur</i> means I dreaded. It is related to the word <i>va-yagar</i> (was sore afraid) in <i>And Moab was sore afraid</i> (Num. 22:3).

Verse 29

EXCEPT THEIR ROCK HAD GIVEN THEM OVER. <i>Mekharam</i> means had given them over.<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">The word literally means sold them.

It is thus a literal sale.<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the use of the word <i>mekharam</i> in our verse.</i>
HAD DELIVERED THEM UP. <i>Hisgiram</i> (had delivered them up) is similar to <i>yisgor</i> (shutteth up) in, <i>He shutteth up a man</i> (Job 12:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">In this case our verse reads, except their Rock has shut them up.</i> On the other hand, it might be similar to <i>hasgiro</i> (deliver him up) in <i>and our part shall be to deliver him up</i> (I Sam. 23:20).

AND THE CRUEL POISON OF ASPS. <i>Petanim</i> (asps) is similar to the word <i>paten</i> (asp) in <i>on the hole of the asp</i> (Is. 11:8).

Verse 34

Verse 35

VENGEANCE IS MINE, AND RECOMPENSE. <i>Shillem</i> (recompense) is a noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote">Although it is vocalized like a verb.

AGAINST THE TIME WHEN THEIR FOOT SHALL SLIP. It means<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>when their foot shall slip</i>.</i> they will fall and be unable to stand.

The meaning of <i>the things that are to come</i> is, the evil things that are about to come.

Verse 36

THEIR STAY IS GONE. The stay of Israel. <i>Yad</i> (stay) means the strength.

The word <i>ve-shavat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shavat</i> is a third person feminine perfect.</i> (then it shall return) in <i>then it shall return to the prince</i> is similar (Ezek. 46:17).

Verse 38

WHO DID EAT. Scripture employs the language of the enemies<sup class="footnote-marker">349</sup><i class="footnote">Of Israel.</i> who thought that the burnt offerings serve as food for God. Scripture employs the plural as they do.<sup class="footnote-marker">350</sup><i class="footnote">The nations speak of Israel’s gods (<i>yokhelu, yishtu, yakumu</i>).</i> The Torah therefore states, <i>I</i>, only <i>I, am He, And there is no god with Me</i> (v. 39).
THE WINE OF THEIR DRINK-OFFERING. <i>Yen nesikham</i><sup class="footnote-marker">351</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of which is <i>nasikh</i>.</i> (the wine of their drink-offering) is similar to <i>venisko</i><sup class="footnote-marker">352</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of which is <i>nesekh</i>.</i> <i>yayin</i> (and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine) (Lev. 23:13).

See <i>Kiddushin</i> 40a.</i> <i>that it may go well with thee</i> (Deut. 5:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">378</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis this verse alludes to life in the word to come. See <i>Kiddushin</i> 40a.</i> Rabbi Hai Gaon, of blessed memory, says that Scripture had no need to state clearly that a future world exists because it was known by tradition. I believe that [Scripture does not speak of a future world] because the Torah was given to all. It was not given to an individual alone. The topic of the world to come is not comprehended by even one in a thousand, for it is very abstruse. The reward in the world to come is contingent on the nature of the soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. one cannot understand the nature of the soul unless he has mastered the sciences. “[A]…person who did not study psychology will not understand the five ways in which a human being’s soul is similar to its creator. One cannot know the latter if one has not studied the very intricate sciences dealing with the heavens and the earth” (<i>Yesod Mora</i> 1, Strickman translation, p. 22).</i> The reward<sup class="footnote-marker">380</sup><i class="footnote">Given in the future world.</i> is given for the service of the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote">Observing the commandments with one’s heart, for they develop the soul. “Pay attention and note that all precepts written in the Torah, transmitted by tradition, or enacted by the Rabbis, aim at perfecting the heart” (<i>Yesod Mora</i>, Chapter 8, p. 100).</i> The latter consists in comprehending the works of God,<sup class="footnote-marker">382</sup><i class="footnote">The reference appears to be to the sciences. “Man’s soul is unique. When given by God, it is like a tablet set before a scribe. When God’s writing, which consists of the categorical knowledge of the things made out of the four elements, the knowledge of the spheres, the throne of glory, the secret of the chariot, and the knowledge of the Most High, is inscribed on this tablet the soul cleaves to God the Glorious while it is yet in man and also afterward when its power is removed from the body.” (<i>Yesod Mora</i>, Chapter 10, p. 143. See also Chapter 7, p. 107, “The intelligent person will…study the scienees…he will isolate himself for the purpose of studying and meditating upon God’s law and observing the Lord’s precepts…God’s right hand of bliss will be eternally upon his soul when it separates from the body.”</i> for they are the ladder whereon one ascends to the level of understanding the knowledge of God, which is what is most important. Observe, the Torah itself explains to the intelligent the topic of the tree of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">383</sup><i class="footnote">The tree of life alludes to eternal life. See I.E. on Gen. 3:24 (Vol. 1, p. 78). Also see previous note.</i> Behold, there is a power by which one can overcome the cherubim.<sup class="footnote-marker">384</sup><i class="footnote">Which prevent man from reaching the tree of life. See Gen. 3:24. According to I.E. the cherubim symbolize the distractions (e.g., lust, materialism) which prevent man from developing His soul.</i> The one who eats from the tree of life<sup class="footnote-marker">385</sup><i class="footnote">The person who acquires wisdom and develops his soul.</i> gains eternal life like the ministering angels. The psalm of the sons of Korah similarly reads, <i>Hear this, all ye peoples…</i>(Ps. 49:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">386</sup><i class="footnote">And goes on to speak of the future world.</i> The secret<sup class="footnote-marker">387</sup><i class="footnote">To this psalm.</i> is <i>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world; For He shall receive</i> (take) <i>me. Selah</i> (Ps. 49:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">388</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, this psalm teaches that there is a future world. I.E. makes this same point in his commentary on Psalms.</i> Scripture similarly states, <i>And afterward receive</i> (take) me <i>with glory</i> (Ps. 73:24). Both verses employ the word “taking” as Scripture does in the account of Enoch<sup class="footnote-marker">389</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 5:24.</i> and Elijah.<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 2:2-10.</i> Now, since Scripture states, <i>But God will redeem my soul</i> [<i>from the power of the netherworld</i>] (Ps. 49:16), how could it say, <i>For too costly is the redemption of their soul</i> (Ps. 49:9)?<sup class="footnote-marker">391</sup><i class="footnote">This verse implies that there is no future world.</i> The intelligent will understand.<sup class="footnote-marker">392</sup><i class="footnote">That Ps. 49:9 applies to physical death and Ps. 49:16 to deliverance from spiritual extinction (Weiser).

Verse 40

Verse 44

AND MOSES CAME. Our verse teaches that after Moses went to each one of the tribes and charged them,<sup class="footnote-marker">425</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 31:1.</i> when he came to the tent of meeting and all of the children of Israel were gathered unto him, he spoke the words of this song.<sup class="footnote-marker">426</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, and Moses came means and Moses came to the tent of meeting where all of Israel were gathered.

Scripture refers to Joshua by the name of Hoshea because it was the name by which he was known to all of Israel, for who aside from the elect of the assembly knew that Moses referred to Hoshea by the name of Joshua.

Verse 2

CAME FROM SINAI. The Gaon,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</i> of blessed memory, says that Mount Sinai, Seir, and Paran are close to each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer Ha-Emunot Ve-Ha-De’ot</i> 3:8. “These (Sinai, Seir, Paran) are three names for Mount Sinai.” The Gaon claims that the different names refer to different sides of the mountain.</i> This verse speaks of the revelation at Sinai. Scripture reads <i>mi-sinai</i> (from Sinai), for <i>mi-sinai</i> has the same meaning as <i>be-sinai</i> (on Sinai).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to Sinai. Thus the meaning of <i>Adonai mi-sinai ba</i> (the Lord came from Sinai) is, God came to Sinai.</i> The same applies to the term <i>mise’ir</i> (from Seir).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It means to Seir. Saadiah Gaon is reacting to an interpretation offered by Jewish heretics or apostates. The apostates interpreted our verse as follows: God first revealed himself to Israel at Sinai. He then revealed himself to the Christians (Seir). He then revealed himself to the Arabs (Paran). This heretical interpretation is based on a midrash which identifies Seir with Christianity and Paran with the Arabs. See <i>Sefer Ha-Emunot Ve-Ha-De’ot</i> 3:8. Also see Mark Cohen, <i>Under Crescent and Cross</i>, p. 156, Princeton University Press, 1994.</i>
FROM THE MYRIADS HOLY. The reference is to the angels. Scripture speaks of the Divine presence, which descended.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">On Mount Sinai.</i>
A FIERY LAW UNTO THEM. The Torah, which was given through fire and lightning.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20:15.</i> He<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Gaon.</i> says that the <i>Lord came…</i>is a prayer. It means, You who came to Sinai and bequeathed the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To Israel.</i> <i>Let Reuben live</i> (v. 6). However, this interpretation is far-fetched, for Scripture should read, keep Reuben alive and do not put him to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6 reads <i>yechi re’uven ve-al yamut</i>, the import of which is, may Reuben live, and not die. If Saadiah Gaon’s interpretation was correct the verse would read <i>hachayeh et re’uven ve-al tamito</i> (keep Reuben alive and do not put him to death). In other words, Scripture would have employed the imperative <i>hachayeh</i> (keep him alive) rather than the third person <i>yechi</i> (let him live). It similarly would have employed the second person <i>tamito</i> (you will put him to death) in place of the third person <i>yamut</i> (he will die).</i> Those who lack faith say that <i>from Seir</i> refers to the religion of the Edomites,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Christianity.</i> and Paran refers to the faith of the Ishmaelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See note 6.</i> However, these err. Do they not see that Moses commenced at first to bless Israel alone. Scripture thus reads, <i>wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel</i> (v. 1). Scripture goes on to say <i>ve-zarach mi-se’ir lamo</i>, the meaning of which is, And rose from Seir unto them.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> Compare, <i>lamo</i> (for them) in <i>And there is no stumbling for them</i> (Ps. 119:165).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>lamo</i> means unto them.</i> It appears to me that this chapter is a general blessing to all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 2-5.</i> Moses then goes on to address each tribe and tribe individually.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 6-25.</i> Then Moses includes them all in the verse which reads, <i>There is none unto God, O Jeshurun</i> (v. 26). Look,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. goes on to explain our verse.</i> we find that Deborah said, <i>Lord, when Thou didst go forth out of Seir, When Thou didst march out of the field of Edom, The earth trembled</i> (Jud. 5:4). Clearly the field of Edom is not a mountain as the Gaon says,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For a field is not a mountain. The field of Edom (<i>sede edom</i>) is parallel to Seir. If <i>sede edom</i> does not refer to a mountain neither does Seir.</i> for the Gaon maintains that Sinai, Seir, and Paran are three mountains close to each other or facing each other. Also, the Book of Psalms states, <i>O God, when Thou wentest forth before thy people, When Thou didst march through the wilderness</i> (yeshimon); <i>Selah</i> (Ps. 68:8). Scripture then states, <i>The earth trembled</i> (Ps. 68:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Jud. 5:4, which speaks of the earth trembling, does not refer to the revelation at Sinai for Ps. 68:8 indicates that the earth trembled in the <i>yeshimon</i> not at Sinai. I.E. comments thus because someone might still insist on identifying the field of Edom with Mount Sinai. It should be noted that I.E. insists that the clause “the earth trembled” in Jud. 5:4 and the similar clause in Ps. 68:9 refer to the same event. See I.E. on Ps. 68:8.</i> Now the Divine presence did not march through the wilderness (<i>yeshimon</i>) on the day that the Torah was given, for Israel came to the wilderness (<i>yeshimon</i>) after they had passed through the wilderness (<i>midbar</i>) of Paran.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Seir is to be identified with Sinai.</i> Furthermore, Habakkuk says, <i>God cometh from Teman</i> (Hab. 3:3). Teman was one of the sons of Edom, for we read, <i>Teman, Omar</i> (Gen. 36:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Are the sons of Eliphaz the son of Esau (Edom).</i> <i>From Teman</i> means the same as <i>from the field of Edom</i>. Look, all the verses<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The verse quoted from Judges, Psalms, and Habbakuk.</i> speak of war. <i>Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered</i> (Ps. 68:2) is proof of this. Scripture describes God’s saving of His servants in terms of help coming down from heaven, the earth melting, the mountains dissolving, and the heavens quaking. <i>Then the earth did shake and quake</i> (Ps. 18:8) in David’s song is proof of this. I have explained the meaning of <i>even yon Sinai</i> (Ps. 68:9) in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ps. 68:8. The meaning of Ps. 68:9 is that the earth trembled as Mount Sinai (<i>zeh sinai</i>) did. In other words, the phrase <i>zeh sinai</i> does not imply that what comes before (the earth trembled…) refers to the revelation at Sinai.</i> The following is the explanation of our verse. <i>The Lord came</i> refers to the glory that entered into Israel. It first entered Israel at Sinai. <i>And rose from Seir</i> means that God did not show His might among the nations all the years that Israel was in the wilderness until Israel came to the field of Edom. Scripture similarly states, <i>in their mount Seir, unto El-paran</i> (Gen. 14:6). Seir and Paran are thus close to each other. The meaning of <i>And rose from Se’ir</i> is thus explained, for <i>mi-seir</i> means from the place of Seir; that is, when Israel came to Seir, God’s glory rose to Israel. <i>He shined forth from mount Paran</i> repeats the idea expressed by <i>and rose from Seir</i>. It means that God here<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In Paran and Seir.</i> showed His shining.
AND HE CAME FROM THE MYRIADS HOLY. I believe that this is connected to <i>At His right hand</i>. It means that fire came <i>from the myriads holy</i> at God’s right hand to surround Israel. It<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The statement that fire came from God’s hand to surround Israel.</i> is similar to the <i>horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha</i> (II Kings 6:17).
[FIERY LAW.] The meaning of <i>law</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>dat</i>. I.E. renders <i>esh dat</i> (a fiery law) as a constant fire.</i> is something constant.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets our verse as follows: a constant fire comes to them at His right hand.</i>

Verse 3

YEA, HE LOVETH THE PEOPLES. <i>Hovev</i> (loveth) comes from an Aramaic word. It<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yea, He loveth the peoples</i>.</i> has the meaning of <i>then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples</i> (Ex. 19:5). <i>The peoples refers to Israel. Compare, After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples (Jud. 5:14); They shall call peoples unto the mountain (v. 19</i>).
[ALL HIS HOLY ONES.] This refers to the sons of Levi.
THEY ARE IN THY HAND. They are round about the ark.
AND THEY SIT DOWN AT THY FEET. This means they will walk in Your ways. The meaning of <i>in Thy hand</i> is, you will protect them.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. earlier interpreted <i>in Thy hand</i> to mean that the Levites camp around the ark. His comment here is either another interpretation or it explains why Moses refers to the ark as <i>Thy hand</i>.</i>

RECEIVING.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew <i>yissa</i> (literally, they will bear).</i> Each and every one.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Levites.</i> This is so even though they are many.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The verse opens with the plural (<i>ve-hem</i>). However, <i>yissa</i> (receiving) is singular. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> 
The meaning of <i>Thy words</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the meaning of <i>yissa mi-dabberotekha</i> (literally, they will bear your words).</i> is, that which You spoke they will bear,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Upon their lips.</i> for they are the bearers of the Torah, and they also carry the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture employs the term <i>yissa</i>, which means to bear upon the lips (to speak of, to teach) and to physically bear.</i> 
The word <i>yissa</i> (receiving) is similar to <i>tissa</i> (uttering) in <i>Thou shalt not utter a false report</i> (Ex. 23:1).
AND THEY SIT DOWN. <i>Tukku</i> (sit down) has no brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">It does not appear elsewhere in Scripture.</i> Some say<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi.</i> that it is related to the word <i>mi-tokh</i> (from the midst of).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to the word <i>tokh</i>.</i> They, as it were, walk in the midst of Your feet. Others say that the <i>tav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>tukku</i>.</i> is in place of a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>tukku</i> is a variant of <i>hukku</i> (were beaten).</i> It is like the <i>tav</i> of <i>tirgalti</i> (I taught)<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tirgalti</i> is a variant of <i>hirgalti</i>.</i> in <i>I taught Ephraim</i> (Hos. 11:3).

Verse 5

A KING. The reference is to Moses, from whose mouth the heads of the people clearly heard the words of the Torah. The meaning of our verse is that Moses was the equivalent of a king, and the heads of the tribes were gathered unto him.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">To study Torah.</i> This interpretation is supported by Scripture’s statement that the Torah was given to the <i>kohanim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 31:9.</i> who, in my opinion, are meant by <i>All His holy ones-they are in Thy hand</i> (v. 3), and to <i>all the elders of Israel</i> (Deut. 31:9). This is what <i>When the heads of the people were gathered</i> refers to. Scripture also writes there, <i>Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes</i> (Deut. 31:28). Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, of blessed memory, says that the <i>king</i> alludes to the Torah. He similarly used to explain <i>there was no king in Israel</i> (Jud. 18:l).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">He renders the verse, there was no Torah in Israel.

Had Aaron sinned in making the golden calf, then that sin would have been mentioned. Furthermore, if Aaron had made an idol Moses would not have referred to him as <i>ish chasidekha</i>.

[THY THUMMIM AND THY URIM.]<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">That is the meaning of <i>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one</i>.</i> This means may Thy Thummim and Thy Urim always be his<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron’s.</i> and his seed’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron and his descendants.</i>

Verse 9

WHO SAID.

There were among them individuals who begot children for the service of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">They handed over their children to God’s service and did not ever see them again (Weiser).</i> FOR THEY HAVE OBSERVED<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew <i>shameru</i> (literally, kept).</i>
THY WORD, AND KEEP THY COVENANT. Compare, <i>They kept</i> (shameru) <i>His testimonies</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">They preserved the contents of God’s revelation in order to teach it to Israel. See I.E. on Ps. 99:7.</i> <i>and the statue that He gave them</i> (Ps. 99:7) so that they would teach them to Israel. Some say that the reference<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>They have observed Thy word…</i></i> is to <i>Whoso is on the Lord’s side, let him come unto me</i> (Ex. 32:26).

Verse 10

THEY SHALL PUT INCENSE. The reference is to those among them who are <i>kohanim</i>.
AND WHOLE BURNT-OFFERING. <i>Kalil</i> (whole burnt offering) refers to the <i>olah</i> (burnt offering).<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">A sacrifice which is totally consumed by the fire on the altar. See Lev. 1:1-13.</i>

Verse 11

BLESS, LORD, HIS SUBSTANCE. The first-born and the tithe.

SMITE THROUGH THE LOINS. Smite them that rise against him.
THAT THEY RISE NOT AGAIN. <i>Min yekumun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Min yekumun</i> literally means of them will arise against them.</i> (that they rise not again) means of those that will rise against them.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>min yekumun</i> is short for <i>min asher yekumun alehem</i>, that is, of them that will arise against them. <i>Yekumun</i> is a variation of <i>yakum</i> (they shall arise).</i> Compare, <i>la-yam mekhassim</i> (cover the sea) (Is. 11:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>La-yam mekhassim</i> is to be read as if written <i>asher la-yam mekhassim</i>, i.e., that cover the sea.</i>

Verse 12

OF BENJAMIN HE SAID. <i>Le-vinyamin</i> means of Benjamin.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Not to Benjamin. The <i>lamed</i> usually means to.

HE COVERETH HIM. The reference is to God’s glory which, as Scripture writes,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 18:28.</i> dwelled in Benjamin’s portion, in Jerusalem. 
The meaning of <i>between his shoulders</i> is, in the center of his inheritance. Or <i>between his shoulders</i> means that God’s glory was visible.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Over the temple.

Verse 13

FOR THE PRECIOUS THINGS. Which the heavens will give.

Verse 14

THE FRUITS OF THE SUN. For the fruits of the seed and the vineyard are dependent upon the sun.
THE YIELD. <i>Geresh</i> (yield) is related to the word <i>vayigreshu</i> (cast up) in <i>And its waters cast up</i> (Is. 57:20). The moon does this<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Produces its yield.</i> via the moisture which is in the air,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">The moon affects the moisture in the air. This results in “the yield of the moon.”</i> for its heat is unlike the power of the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Which directly influences the growth of plants. The sun’s rays directly influence plant life. The moon has no rays. I.E. believed that the moon influences plant growth by its effect on the moisture in the air.</i> Scripture reads moons<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">There is one moon.

Verse 15

AND FOR THE TOPS. This means and for the precious things that grow on the tops of the ancient hills.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>meged</i> from the previous verse also applies here. Thus <i>u-merosh harere kedem</i> (and for the tops of the ancient mountains) is to be read as if written <i>u-mi-meged rosh ha-rere kedem</i> (and for the precious things that grow on the tops of the ancient mountains).</i>
THE EVERLASTING HILLS. Scripture repeats itself.

Verse 16

AND FOR THE PRECIOUS THINGS OF THE EARTH. Scripture repeats itself. <i>The earth</i> refers to flat land.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>the earth</i> is in contrast to the mountains and hills mentioned in the previous verse.</i>
AND THE FULNESS THEREOF. From what it is full of.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Not only the produce of the land but of all things that the earth is full of, i.e., gold, silver, etc. (Krinsky).</i>
AND THE GOOD WILL OF HIM THAT DWELT IN THE BUSH. The reference is to heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets the word <i>seneh</i> (bush) as meaning heaven. However, he rejects this interpretation in Ex. 3:2 (Vol. 2, pp. 52,53).</i>
LET THE BLESSING COME. <i>Tavotah</i> (let the blessing come)<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tavotah</i> is the elongated or poetic form of the word <i>tavo</i>.</i> refers to this blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing mentioned in verses 13-16.</i> Two signs,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Two letters which are signs of the feminine.</i> the <i>tav</i> and the <i>heh</i>, are joined together.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">The elongated form of <i>tavo</i> should have read <i>tavo’ah</i> or <i>tavo’at.

Verse 17

MAJESTY IS HIS. His<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The bullock’s.</i> body is large. It means that the tribe of Joseph is large in number.

THE TEN THOUSANDS OF EPHRAIM. As in the words of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Who gave Joseph the blessing of many children. See Gen. 49:25.</i>

Verse 18

REJOICE, ZEBULUN, IN THY GOING OUT. To war. Similarly <i>Zebulun is a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death</i> (Jud. 5:18).
IN THY TENTS. Compare, <i>For he saw a resting-place that it was good</i> (Gen. 49:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 49:15 refers to the tribe of Issachar.</i>

Verse 19

THEY SHALL CALL PEOPLES UNTO THE MOUNTAIN. Zebulun shall possess great wealth because he dwells where ships dock. This is the meaning of <i>they shall suck the abundance of the seas</i>. The word <i>shefa</i> (abundance) is related to the word <i>shifat</i> (caravan) in <i>The caravan of camels shall cover thee</i> (Is. 60:6).
AND THE HIDDEN TREASURES OF THE SAND. The word <i>sefune</i> (hidden) has no brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">It is not found elsewhere in Scripture.</i> It has the same meaning as <i>temune</i> (treasures).<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads <i>sefune temune</i>. I.E. believes that Scripture employs two words back to back that have one meaning. It means hidden hidden [of the earth].</i> Similarly <i>admat afar</i> (dust).<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Dan. 12:2. Both words mean the same. Our text literally reads dust dust.</i> The meaning of the <i>hidden treasures of the sand</i> is that Zebulun will have so much wealth that they [the tribe] will hide it in the sand. And because of their wealth, they will come in a multitude to the mountain of God to offer sacrifices of thanksgiving to the Lord.

Verse 20

ENLARGETH GAD. Moses compares Gad to a lion. All who see him will flee from him. No one shall torment him.

Verse 21

AND HE CHOSE A FIRST PART FOR HIMSELF.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, he saw a first (<i>reshit</i>) for himself. According to I.E. <i>he saw</i> is short for he sought an inheritance. <i>First</i> means before the other Israelites, and <i>himself</i> means he sought it for himself. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> This means he looked out for himself and sought an inheritance before the other Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Received their inheritance. See Num. 32.</i>
FOR THERE A PORTION OF A RULER WAS RESERVED. The word <i>chelkat</i> (portion of) means a portion.
[A RULER.] <i>Mechokek</i> (ruler) refers to someone who is great and a ruler. Compare, <i>My heart is toward the governors</i> (le-chokeke) <i>of Israel</i> (Jud. 5:9).
[RESERVED.] The word <i>safun</i> (reserved) is similar to <i>safun</i> (ceiled) in <i>and it is ceiled</i><sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Ceilinged or paneled.</i> <i>with cedar</i> (Jer. 22:14); and <i>sefunim</i> (ceiled) in <i>be-vattekhem sefunim</i> (Haggai 1:4), which means your houses which are ceiled. The import of <i>ki sham chelkak mechokek safun</i> (for there a portion of a ruler was preserved)<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Which, according to I.E., means for there is the ceiled palace of the ruler.</i> is that Gad saw the paneled palaces that were the portion of the nobles of the Amorites.
CAME. <i>Va-yeta</i> (came)<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Spelled <i>vav, yod, tav, alef</i>.</i> is missing an <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">It should be spelled <i>vav, yod, alef, tav, alef</i>, for its root is <i>alef, tav, alef</i>.</i> The meaning of our clause is that the heads of Gad came armed with the children of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">To conquer Canaan. See Josh. 1:12-18; 22:1-9.</i> Moses prophetically saw this.
HE EXECUTED THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LORD.

The same oath was made and observed by the tribe of Reuben. See Num. 32:16,17 and Josh. 1:12-18; 22:1-9.</i> It is possible that he omitted Reuben because the tribe of Gad were greater warriors than the tribe of Reuben. The words of Chronicles, which states regarding the tribe of Gad, <i>whose faces were like the faces of lions</i> (I Chron. 12:9), is proof of this. We do not find this stated regarding the tribe of Reuben.

Verse 22

LEAPETH. The word <i>yezannek</i> (leapeth) has no companion in Scripture. Our clause is to be understood as follows: Moses compared Dan’s might to that of a lion’s whelp leaping from Mount Bashan.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yezannek</i> means leap. According to I.E. our verse should be understood as follows: Dan is as powerful as a young lion leaping forth from Mount Bashan. Bashan is a district in Transjordan.</i>

Verse 23

SATISFIED WITH FAVOR. <i>Seva ratzon</i> (satisfied) is an adjective. It means he will be sated with favor.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>seva</i> is not to be taken as an imperative with our verse meaning Naphtali be satisfied with God’s favor.</i>
THE SEA AND SOUTH. <i>Yam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>yam</i> (sea) as west.</i> <i>ve-darom</i> (the sea and south) means that Naphtali’s inheritance shall be in the southwest.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Of the tribe of Dan (Weiser).</i>

Verse 24

THE FAVORED. <i>Ratzuy</i> (favored) means the beloved.
AND LET HIM DIP HIS FOOT IN OIL. Because of the abundance of oil. It is similar to <i>He washeth his garments in wine</i> (Gen. 49:11). Jacob similarly said,<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the tribe of Dan.</i> <i>his bread shall be fat</i> (Gen. 49:20).

Verse 25

IRON AND BRASS SHALL BE THY BARS.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>minalekha</i>. I.E. renders this, the place where you walk upon with your shoes (<i>na’alkha</i>). Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> For mountains of iron and brass shall be in his portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Asher will step upon iron and brass.</i>
AND AS THY DAYS, SO SHALL THY STRENGTH BE. The word <i>dovekha</i> (thy strength) has no neighbor.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">It is not found elsewhere in the Bible.</i> The interpretation of the Aramaic translation<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders <i>u-kheyamekha dovekha</i> (and as thy days, so shall thy strength be), and as thy youth so shall your strength be [all the days of your life].</i> is known, namely, that you will be strong all your days. Some say that the <i>alef</i> of <i>dovekha</i> is in place of the doubled letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>dovekha</i> comes from the root <i>dalet, bet, bet</i>.</i> It is like the word <i>baze’u</i> (divide)<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a variant of <i>bazezu</i>, for the <i>alef</i> in <i>baze’u</i> takes the place of a <i>zayin</i>.</i> in <i>Whose land the rivers divide</i> (Is. 18:2). They believe that <i>dovekha</i> is related to the word <i>dovev</i> (moving gently) in <i>Moving gently the lips of those that are asleep</i> (Cant. 7:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">They interpret <i>u-kheyamekha dovekha</i> to mean: as in your youth so shall you speak [all the days of your life]; i.e., you shall always speak happily as young people are wont to do (Weiser).</i> This interpretation is not reasonable.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">It does not fit the context.</i>

Verse 26

THERE IS NONE LIKE UNTO GOD, O JESHURUN. Moses goes back to bless all of Israel.
WHO RIDETH UPON THE HEAVEN. That is, who is mighty. The fact that He <i>rideth upon the heaven</i> is proof of this.
[AND IN HIS EXCELLENCY ON THE SKIES.]<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and in His excellency the skies.</i> It means, the heavens stand by God’s might.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>be-gavato</i> (in His excellency) by His might. Therefore <i>And in His might the skies</i> is short for and by His might the heavens stand. I.E. renders our verse as follows: He who rides upon the heavens is your help, and He [so too is] by whose might the heavens stand.</i>

Verse 27

THE ETERNAL GOD IS A DWELLING-PLACE. Note that the word <i>ma’on</i> (dwelling-place) means a covering (i.e., a <i>sukkah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, booth. According to I.E. a <i>sukkah</i> is so called because it has a covering over it.</i> <i>In Salem also is set His covering</i><sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (sukko), <i>And His dwelling-place</i> (me’onato) <i>in Zion</i><sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>sukko</i> is parallel to <i>me’onato</i>.</i> (Ps. 76:3) is proof of this. There are many such examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Where the word <i>sukkah</i> is used in the sense of protection.</i> The meaning of our verse is: The eternal God is your covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">That is, your protection.</i> Compare, <i>Even the Most High, thy habitation</i> (me’onekha)<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders this as even the Most High, your protection.</i> (Ps. 91:9) and <i>Thou hast been our dwelling-place</i> (ma’on) (Ps. 90:1). The <i>ma’on</i> (dwelling place) is always above the one who takes refuge in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>ma’on</i> means a protective covering. God serves as a protective covering above us.</i> The “place”<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis refer to God as “The Place (<i>makom</i>).”</i> is below.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Either beneath the protective covering or beneath the person being protected. In other words, <i>ma’on</i> refers to “up above” and <i>makom</i> to below. God is referred to as “The Place” because He is present in all places on the earth. See I.E.’s introduction to Esther, “God is not referred to as ‘The Place (<i>makom</i>)’ in any of the books of Scripture. On the contrary, He is referred to as ‘dwelling place (<i>ma’on</i>),’ for the <i>ma’on</i> which is always on high. However, the ancients, of blessed memory, called God ‘The Place’ because all places are full of His glory.”</i>
AND UNDERNEATH ARE THE EVERLASTING ARMS. Which will support you. 
Scripture reads <i>everlasting</i> to teach that it shall always be so. The hand will not weaken, and your covering (<i>ma’on</i>) will not be removed, for He is the eternal God. The meaning of <i>kedem</i> (everlasting) is that God has no beginning and no end. Scripture speaks in human terms when it speaks of beginning and end.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">In reference to God.</i> The Gaon says that <i>and underneath</i> means and underneath God. He did not explain anything.

Verse 28

THE FOUNTAIN OF JACOB. All those who came forth out of the fountain of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>The fountain of Jacob</i> is, All those who came forth out of the fountain of Jacob, i.e., all those descended from Jacob.</i> Similarly <i>And are come forth out of the fountain of Judah</i> (Is. 48:1).
IN A LAND. <i>El eretz</i> is to be rendered, in a land.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>be-eretz</i> as in <i>Vat.

YEA, HIS HEAVENS. The heavens of the earth or of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">The heavens over the Land of Israel.</i> The meaning of our verse is, it is the nature of the land<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Of the land in Israel.</i> to produce corn and oil. Also, the heavens shall always give their dew and there will be no need to water the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of our verse is, God brought Israel into a land which produces corn and oil and whose heavens shall always give dew, and there will be no need to irrigate the ground.</i>

Verse 29

WHO IS LIKE UNTO THEE. Among the nations.
THE SHIELD OF THY HELP. No evil shall come upon you.
AND THAT IS THE SWORD. He is the sword by which you will exalt yourself over all your enemies.
SHALT TREAD. <i>Tidrokh</i> (shall tread) is similar to <i>midrakh</i> (to tread on) in <i>for the sole of the foot to tread on</i> (Deut. 2:5). The contents of our verse are similar to the account of Gideon.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Whose men shouted, “The sword for the Lord and for Gideon.” See Jud. 7:20. <i>Vat.

Chapter 34



Verse 1

AND MOSES WENT UP. I believe that Joshua wrote from this verse onward,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Joshua composed Chapter 34.</i> for Moses did not write<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Anything.</i> after he ascended.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Mount Nebo. Hence he could not have composed this chapter.</i> Joshua wrote prophetically.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 34 was written under Divine inspiration. Hence it could be appended to the Torah.</i> <i>And the Lord showed him; And the Lord said unto him</i> (v. 4); and also, <i>And he was buried</i> (v. 6) are proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That Chapter 34 was written prophetically, for otherwise how would Joshua know these things.</i>

Verse 4



Verse 5

SO MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE. Even in his death Moses, like a servant, did what God commanded him.
ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE LORD.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>al pi Adonai</i> (literally, by God’s mouth). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> For God told him, <i>Get thee up</i> (Deut. 32:49) <i>and die</i> (Deut. 32:50). Scripture similarly writes with regard to the death of Aaron, <i>at the commandment of the Lord</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>al pi Adonai</i>.</i> (Num. 33:38). It similarly states, <i>At the commandment of the Lord</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>al pi Adonai</i>. We thus see that <i>al pi Adonai</i> is not to be taken literally but is to be interpreted according to God’s command. I.E. comments thus because there is a midrash which takes <i>al pi Adonai</i> literally and tells us that Moses died by God’s kiss. See <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 28a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 17a. Also see Rashi.</i> <i>they encamped</i> (Num. 9:23).

Verse 6

I.E.’s point is that the pronoun <i>oto</i> (him) or <i>otam</i> (them) sometimes has the meaning of himself or themselves.</i> He entered a cave in the valley. The same is true of <i>but the shepherds fed them</i> (otam),<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Otam</i> (them) is to be rendered themselves.

See I. E. on Is. 46:1, <i>Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth</i>. According to I.E. the idol Nebo stood and was worshipped on Mount Abarim. Hence Mount Abarim was also known as Mount Nebo.</i> Mount Abarim is also known as “the valley which is the top of Pisgah which is over against Beth-peor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Mount Abarim, Mount Nebo, the valley which is the top of Pisgah which is over against Beth-peor all refer to one place.</i> The fact that Scripture tells us that Israel journeyed <i>from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, by the top of Pisgah</i> (Num. 21:20) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">That the valley (<i>gai</i>) is to be identified with the top of Pisgah.</i> Furthermore, Scripture writes, <i>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah</i> (v. 1).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Pisgah and Mount Nebo refer to the same place.</i> Moses died there<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">On Mount Nebo.</i> and his grave is there.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">On Mount Nebo.</i> Scripture states,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Additional proof that the valley and Mount Abarim are one and the same.</i> <i>So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor (Deut. 3:29). Now, Scripture tells us that after Israel dwelt in the valley…the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab (Num. 22:1). Another verse states, And [Israel] pitched in the mountains of Abarim, in front of Nebo. And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab (Num. 33:47,48). Look, it is clear that Moses’ burial place was in the place where he died.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes issue with the midrash that states that Moses died in the land of the tribe of Reuben (the location of Mount Nebo) but was buried in the land belonging to the tribe of Gad. See <i>Sifre</i> and <i>Sotah</i> 13b.</i></i>
UNTO THIS DAY. These are the words of Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the Talmud that Moses also wrote this verse. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 15a: “The Holy One, blessed be He, dictated, and Moses wrote in tears.”</i> He probably wrote this at the end of his days.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Unto this day</i> indicates that some time had passed since the death of Moses.</i>

Verse 7

HIS NATURAL FORCE. The <i>heh</i> of <i>lechoh</i> (his natural force) is in place of a <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The pronoun “his” is usually indicated by a <i>vav</i>. Here it is indicated by a <i>heh</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is like the <i>heh</i> of <i>oholoh</i> (his tent) (Gen. 9:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Which is in place of a <i>vav</i>.</i> <i>Lechoh</i> is related to the word <i>lach</i> (moist, fresh).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>lechoh</i> means his moistness.</i> Scripture notes this<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses’ moisture did not abate.</i> because old people are overtaken by dryness. 
The word <i>nas</i> (abated) is the reverse of diffused.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Moisture is diffused throughout the skin of a young person. However, it is removed from the skin of an old man. See Filwarg.</i>

Verse 8

THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. However, when Aaron died, <i>even all the house of Israel</i> (Num. 20:29) mourned out of respect for Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The word “all” does not appear before the children of Israel. I.E. believes that Moses did not leave any survivors of such importance that out of respect for them all of Israel would participate in the public mourning for him. It should be noted that the midrash offers a different interpretation for the difference in mourning for Moses and Aaron. See Rashi: “The children of Israel wept,” i.e., the men; but regarding Aaron, because he pursued peace, and made peace between a man and his fellow, and between a woman and her husband, it is stated, “The whole house of Israel wept [for him] the men and the women” (Rosenbaum and Silberman translation). See <i>Pirke De Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chapter 17.</i>
SO…WERE ENDED. When the days of weeping in the mourning of Moses were ended there,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In the plains of Moab.</i> the children of Israel hearkened unto Joshua.

Verse 9

WAS FULL OF THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM. The reference is to the spirit of the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture states, <i>And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him</i> (Is. 11:2). It then goes on to explain that the spirit of the Lord is the spirit of wisdom and understanding (<i>Ibid.</i>). See I.E. on Ex. 31:3 (Vol. 2, pp. 645,646).</i> <i>For Moses had laid his hands upon him</i> is proof of this,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom</i>.</i> for there was not found in Israel one such as Joshua for Moses to lean on.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Another term for “place his hands on him.” It is possible that I.E. interprets <i>Moses had laid his hands upon him</i> to mean relied on him, i.e., took him for a disciple. Be that as it may, according to I.E, <i>For Moses had laid his hands upon him</i> does not mean that the placing of Moses’ hand on Joshua caused Joshua to be full of the spirit of wisdom but rather that Moses placed his hands on Joshua because Joshua was full of the spirit of God.</i>
AND DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES. That they hearken unto Joshua.
