<b>To the midwives.</b> Shifrah and Puah were administrators in charge of all the other midwives, for there were undoubtedly more than five hundred midwives for the entire population. Therefore, it must be that these two were administrators who were responsible for collecting taxes from the midwives’ earnings for Pharaoh; and so have I seen today in many locales. According to the tradition from our Sages they were a mother and daughter, and this is correct.

Verse 16

<b>The Hebrew women.</b> Anyone from the family of Ever is called a Hebrew, and because of his faith he is called a Hebrew. In the same way, it is said (Bereishis 10:21): “And to Shem were also born children; he was the father of all the people of <i>Ever</i>,” meaning, the father of all the people who came from the other side of (<i>m’ever</i>) the river.

<b>And settled in the land of Midian.</b> The Midianites were subservient to Pharaoh, so Moshe chose to be a shepherd in order to keep his distance from the civilized areas, where he might be recognized. When Hashem told him that Pharaoh and all the people that sought his life had died (4:19), and at the same time his youngest son was born, he expressed his appreciation by naming him Eliezer: “The God of my father came to my aid and He saved me from the sword of Pharaoh” (18:4).

Verse 6

<b>[Pharaoh] said, “By tomorrow.”</b> Rabbi Shmuel ben Chafni said: Normally, a person would request that a plague be removed immediately. However, Pharaoh believed that the heavenly constellations brought the plague of frogs upon Egypt by natural means, and Moshe just happened to know when this would happen. Pharaoh reckoned that the natural time for the frogs to leave had arrived, and so he tested Moshe by asking for an extension of time and said: “By tomorrow”.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>Moshe left … and cried out.</b> He trusted that Hashem would not allow him to be humiliated, for in fact it was his own choice to assert to Pharaoh, “As you say,” without approval from Hashem.

Chapter 9



Verse 1

<b>Go to Pharaoh,</b> to his palace. Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi said: There were two plagues involving water, one that the river turned to blood and all the fish died, and one that the frogs came out of the river. There were two plagues on land, the lice and the mixture of wild animals, as the verse states (Bereishis 1:24): “Let the earth bring forth living creatures.” Two were in the air, for pestilence was abnormal heat or chill that caused countless livestock to die at once, since all life depends on the atmosphere. The second one was the plague of rash, for the Torah calls the sky above their head the heavens (and Moshe began the plague of rash by throwing the furnace soot heavenward). The seventh plague (hail) was a mixture of the sphere of storm and fire, as the Torah describes (9:24): “There was hail and fire flashing among the hailstones.” The eighth plague, locusts, came from far away by means of the wind. The ninth one was a wondrous plague, in which the light of the luminaries and the stars disappeared from the land of Egypt. In the tenth, the destroyer came down from the sphere of splendor to kill the first born”.

Chapter 10



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>And so that you (singular) may relate.</b> Hashem is addressing Moshe as the representative of all Yisrael. This can be seen from the fact that at the end of the verse the plural is used. <b>I made a mockery.</b> The Torah is speaking in human idiom, as if Hashem were a human being toying with another for revenge.

<b>Because of this Hashem did this for me.</b> This should be understood: “For the sake of this service—i.e. the eating of the <i>matzoh</i> and the refraining from leaven bread, which were the first commandments that B’nei Yisrael received—Hashem performed for us miracles and took us out of Egypt.” In other words, Hashem only took B’nei Yisrael out of Egypt in order that they should serve Him, in keeping with the verse, “When you bring the people out of Egypt—you will serve Elohim on this mountain” (Shemos 3:12).

<b>In a pillar of cloud.</b> It was shaped not like a cloud but like a pillar extending earthward from heaven. A pillar is called an <i>amud</i> in Hebrew because it is <i>ma’amed</i>—i.e. “holds up”—the house. <b>So that they could travel by day and by night.</b> Because of the enormity of the camp they were only able to travel short distances at a time. Therefore they traveled a brief way in the daytime and then another brief way at night. The two pillars remained with them until the reached the sea.

<b>On that day Ad-noy delivered.</b> Only now were B’nei Yisrael delivered from the Egyptians because until this point they were still in fear of Pharaoh. <b>[B’nei] Yisrael saw the Egyptians dead.</b> It is written later on that the Egyptians “sunk” into the sea (15:4) and that the earth, “swallowed them up” (15:12). Therefore the statement that B’nei Yisrael “saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore” must mean that B’nei Yisrael saw the Egyptians dead in the middle of the sea while they themselves were on the shore.

Verse 31

<b>[B’nei] Yisrael saw.</b> When the people saw the tremendous blow that befell the Egyptians they feared Hashem.
<b>And believed in Ad-noy.</b> They believed that He is the true God and that Moshe was His faithful servant who never deviated from Hashem’s command.

<b>Among the mighty (<i>eilim</i>).</b> This refers to the angels. By contrast, the term <i>b’nei eilim</i>—literally, “<i>sons</i> of the mighty” (Tehillim 29:1)—refers to the stars.
<b>Adorned in holiness.</b> That is, upon His holy Throne. 
<b>Awesome in praise, doing wonders.</b> People are afraid to sing His praises, knowing that they will inevitably fall short. Nevertheless they are obliged to do so to acknowledge that He alone does wonders.

Verse 4

<b>Behold, I will make bread rain.</b> That is, the bread would fall like rain from heaven. The word “bread” (<i>lechem</i>) is used here in a loose sense meaning “food.” Elsewhere the term <i>lechem</i> is applied to meat, as in the phrase, <i>lechem isheh</i>—“it is the food of the fire-offering” (Vayikra 3:11), and fruit, as in the phrase, “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit (<i>belachmo</i>)” (Yirmiyahu 11:19).
<b>That I may test them.</b> The test was that they would need His assistance every day (<i>Ibn Ezra</i>).

<b>If a man steals.</b> According to Rabbi Yehoshua the Torah imposes a greater penalty for stealing an ox because it cannot be concealed and therefore can only be stolen by a professional thief. According to Rav Sadyah Gaon it is because the theft of an ox causes the owner more harm since it is a working animal.

<b>You must not abuse … a stranger.</b> In their own land B’nei Yisrael have an advantage over the strangers living among them—i.e. those gentiles who renounce idolatry. Therefore they are commanded not to abuse them but to recall that they were in a similar position in Egypt.

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>If you do mistreat him.</b> In the previous verse “mistreat” is in the plural, whereas in this verse it is in the singular. This indicates that whoever witnesses the mistreating of a stranger, a widow or an orphan and does not intervene is reckoned as if he committed the deed himself.

<b>This shall be a continual burnt-offering.</b> It is unlikely that they offered these sacrifices while they were in the desert because that would have meant procuring half a <i>hin</i> of oil and a similar quantity of wine everyday. Alternatively they would have had to carry with them about14,000 <i>hin</i> of each to last them the forty years. Moreover, they would have required two lambs daily and additional animals on the holidays. This is the background to God’s rhetorical question in <i>Amos</i> (5:25), “Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness?”.

This explains how Tzadok, the <i>kohein gadol</i>, was able to anoint King Shelomo with oil taken from the Tent of Meeting as described in Melachim I:1:39.

Therefore Rabbi Marinus renders it “although,” similar to the usage in Tehillim 41:5, “Heal my soul <i>although</i> (<i>ki</i>) I have sinned to You.” Alternatively, in both instances the meaning is, “for I acknowledge that, etc.”

These women would gather every day near the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to pray and receive instruction in the commandments.

<b>Moshe was unable to enter.</b> Moshe was the one who placed the cover with the cherubim upon the ark in the first place. It seems likely that he was also the one who covered it with the <i>paroches</i> whenever they broke camp, for no one else could have gazed upon the seat of Hashem’s glory (see I Shemuel 4:4). Apparently, then, it is not that he was unable to enter the Tabernacle at all while the cloud was upon it, but only that he had to wait to be summoned, as can be seen from the first verse in Vayikra, “And He called to Moshe”.
