Ibn Ezra on Exodus



Chapter 1



Verse 1

May the writer and the reader be strong and steadfast<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This poem is found in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. The printed editions omit it as they do many of the other poems which introduce Torah portions in I.E.’s <i>Commentary</i> on Exodus. Some manuscripts open with the following introduction: Abraham’s commentary on the book of Exodus, finished in the year 4913 (1152-53 C.E.), is as precious as onyx. However, other commentaries give the date 4927 (1166-67 C.E.) as the date of the manuscript’s completion. E. Levine notes, “Some writers have held that the 1152-53 date refers to the long commentary whereas the inscription 1166-67 refers to the short commentary; others have maintained that the 1152-53 refers to the short commentary and the 1166-67 refers to the long commentary which was written precisely between 1159 and 1167 C.E.” See Foreword.</i> in the very ark<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, <i>ba-aron be-kemutzot</i>. The reference is to I.E.’s commentary on Exodus. Commenting on the word <i>ba-aron</i> (in a coffin) in Gen. 50:26, I.E. explains, “The reason why <i>ba-aron</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> is that it signifies the coffin which he had prepared for himself.” (See notes on Gen. 50:26.) The word <i>aron</i> can refer to an ark or to a coffin. I.E. is being a bit morbid.</i> which is the house which the author prepared for himself.I now begin to explain the Torah portion, <i>Shemot;</i> which opens the second Book of the Torah. 
NOW THESE ARE. Our book opens with a <i>vav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The book of Exodus opens with the word <i>ve-elleh</i> which literally means, and these are, and is so translated by I.E. The question thus arises, why open a book with a connective? Indeed, Deut. 1:1 opens with <i>elleh ha-devarim</i> and not with <i>ve-elleh ha-devarim</i>. Similarly, Exodus should have read <i>elleh shemot</i> and not <i>ve-elleh shemot</i>.</i> because the end of Genesis relates that <i>Joseph saw the children of the third generation</i> (Genesis 50:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis concludes by relating that <i>Joseph saw the children of the third generation</i>, i.e., that he was fruitful. However, it does not tell us about the fate of his brothers. The latter is related to us at the beginning of Exodus where we are told that <i>the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly</i> (Ex. 1:7). Thus the opening part of Exodus is connected to the closing section of Genesis. Hence the connective <i>vav</i>.</i> Scripture notes that Joseph’s brothers were few in number when they descended to Egypt but that they were fruitful and multiplied there (Exodus 1:7).The word <i>elleh</i> (these) and <i>el</i> (these) are employed equally with the masculine and the feminine. We thus find, <i>For all these abominations</i> (ha-to’evot ha-el)<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>to’evot</i> (abominations) is feminine.</i> (Leviticus 18:27) and then afterward, <i>any of these abominations</i> (ha-to’evot ha-elleh) (Lev. 18:29). We similarly read, <i>unto these men</i> (la-anashim ha-el) (Gen. 19:8); <i>These four</i> (arba’at elleh) <i>were born to the giant</i> (II Samuel 21:22); <i>and what can I do this day for these</i> (la-elleh) <i>my daughters</i> (Gen. 31:43). The same is the case with the word <i>laz</i> (that one).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It too is employed both with the masculine and the feminine.</i> We thus find, <i>that Shunamite</i> (ha-shunammit ha-laz) (II Kings 4:25) and <i>this young man</i> (ha-na’ar ha-laz) (Zechariah 2:8). The fact that the word <i>elleh</i> is penultimately accented indicates that its <i>heh</i> is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The basic word being <i>el</i>. The <i>heh</i> added to the word has no meaning.</i> It is like the <i>heh</i> of <i>laylah</i> (night)<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The basic word being <i>layil</i>.</i> and the <i>heh</i> of <i>nachlah</i> (brook) in <i>the Brook of</i> (nachlah) <i>Egypt</i> (Numbers 34:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>nachal</i>.</i>
[THE NAMES OF.] <i>Shem</i> (name) is masculine. Its plural form is <i>shemot</i> (names), for the <i>tav</i> is used for both the masculine and the feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the word <i>shemot</i> can be a plural masculine. I.E. makes this point because generally speaking only feminine plurals end in a <i>tav</i>.</i> Compare, <i>mekomot</i> (places)<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Its singular is <i>makom</i>, which is masculine.</i> and <i>avot</i> (fathers). The <i>mem</i> is similarly used as a masculine and feminine plural. Compare, <i>nashim</i> (women) and <i>pilagshim</i> (concubines).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">These words are obviously feminine.</i> We also find some nouns employing both the <i>tav</i> and the <i>mem</i> in the plural forms. Compare, <i>nefashim</i> (souls) (Ezekiel 13:20) and <i>nefashot</i> (souls)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nefesh</i> is feminine.</i> (Ezek. 13:18). We similarly find, <i>levavot</i> (hearts) (II Chronicles 28:9) and <i>levavim</i> (hearts).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Levav</i> (heart) is masculine.</i> Compare, <i>al livvehen</i> (upon their hearts)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Livvehen</i> is made up of the plural <i>levavim</i> plus the suffix for their.</i> (Nahum 2:8).[Into Egypt.] The <i>heh</i> of <i>mitzrayemah</i> (into Egypt) is in place of the word <i>el</i> (to). Compare, <i>dotayenah</i> (to Dothan) in <i>nelekh dotayenah</i> (let us go down to Dothan) (Gen. 37:16); and <i>yerushalayemah</i> (to Jerusalem) in <i>and brought me in the vision of God to Jerusalem</i> (Ezek. 8:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yerushalayemah</i> is equivalent to <i>el yerushalayim</i> (to Jerusalem) and <i>dotayenah</i> to <i>el dotan</i> (to Dothan). Similarly, <i>mitzrayemah</i> is equivalent to <i>el mitzrayim</i> (to Egypt).</i>
WITH JACOB. <i>Et ya’akov</i> means with Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Et</i> is usually placed before the direct object. Here it is used as a preposition meaning with.</i> Compare, <i>In that day the Lord made a covenant with</i> (et) <i>Abram</i> (Gen. 15:18).
EVERY MAN CAME WITH HIS HOUSEHOLD. <i>Beto</i> (his household) refers to those who came out of his loins. The term <i>bayit</i> (house, household) in Scripture never refers to a wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud uses the term <i>bayit</i> (house) as a synonym for wife. Cf. <i>Sabbath</i> 118b: “Rabbi Jose said, I never called my wife, my wife but I called her my house.” Also see <i>Yoma</i> 2a, “<i>Beto zo ishto</i> (<i>His household</i> [Lev. 16:18] refers to his wife).”</i> <i>Every man came with his household</i> (beto) is proof of this, for the wives of the tribes are not included in the seventy who descended into Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 46:8-27 lists the seventy descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt. Women are not enumerated. In fact they are specifically excluded (Gen. 46: 26). This proves that <i>beto</i> does not mean one’s wife.</i> Do not permit the verse <i>and</i> (the high priest shall) <i>have made atonement for himself, and for his household</i> (beto) (Lev. 16:18) to cause you any difficulty.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Pentateuch states that on the Day of Atonement the high priest shall make atonement <i>for himself and for his household. Prima facie</i>, “his household” seems to refer to the wife of the high priest. See end of note 18.</i> For according to the plain meaning of the text, <i>beto</i> (his household) refers to his father’s house. <i>Beto</i> (his household) must be so interpreted because the high priest made three confessions on the Day of Atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah states that the high priest shall make atonement <i>for himself, and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel</i> (Lev. 16:18). According to the Talmud the making of atonement refers to confession of sins (<i>viduy</i>). Cf. <i>Yoma</i> 36b. The three confessions offered by the high priest were on behalf of himself (<i>for himself</i>), on behalf of the house of Aaron (<i>his household</i>), and on behalf of the people of Israel (<i>and for all the assembly of Israel</i>).</i> The priest’s helpmate, who is his wife, is included in the term <i>for himself</i>. She is included with him because a husband and a wife make a “man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Yevamot</i> 63a: “Any Jew that has no wife is not a man.” Also see Gen. 1:27, <i>And God created man…male and female created He them</i>.</i>

Verse 2

REUBEN. When a word beginning with a letter that is vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva</i> (<i>sheva na</i>), e.g., the <i>zayin</i> of Zevulun, has a <i>bet, vav, kaf</i>, or <i>lamed</i> prefixed to it, the prefix ideally should also be vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bet, vav, kaf</i>, and <i>lamed</i> are prepositional prefixes. They are usually vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva</i>. I.E. explains the rules of the vocalization of the prefixes in this note because a connective <i>vav</i> is prefixed to many of the names of the sons of Jacob listed in our chapter.</i> However, due to the impossibility of sounding two mobile <i>sheva’im</i> in succession these prefixes are vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> rather than with a <i>sheva</i>. Hence if the word <i>zevulun</i> has a <i>bet</i> prefixed to it we say <i>bi-zevulun</i> (in Zebulun), If <i>zevulun</i> has a <i>kaf</i> or <i>lamed</i> prefixed to it we say <i>ki-zevulun</i> (like Zebulun) or <i>li-zevulun</i> (to Zebulun). However, if the word has a <i>vav</i> prefixed to it then it is vocalized with a <i>shuruk</i> rather than a <i>chirik</i>. We sound the <i>vav</i> as if it had an <i>alef</i> preceding it and pronounce the word <i>u-zevulun</i> (and Zebulun) for the word is sounded as if it were written <i>alef vav</i> plus <i>zevulun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vav</i> is the sign of the <i>shuruk</i>. I.E. explains that a <i>shuruk</i> is sounded as if spelled <i>alef vav;</i> i.e., it is pronounced ooh.</i> However, if we deal with a word whose first letter is a <i>yod</i>, an example being the name <i>yehudah</i>, then the <i>yod</i> is silent, for the <i>yod</i> is one of the quiescent letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The quiescent letters are the <i>alef, heh, vav</i>, and <i>yod</i>. These letters surrender their consonantal function by coalescing with surrounding vowel signs at the end of a syllable or word. Thus the <i>yod</i> following a <i>chirik</i> or <i>tzere</i> is not sounded as a consonant. Hence the term quiescent letters.</i> Compare, <i>biyhudah</i> (against Judah) in <i>Let us go up against Judah</i> (Isaiah 7:6) and <i>kiyhudah</i> (like Judah) and <i>liyhudah</i> (of Judah) in <i>Of Judah, Nahshon</i> (Num. 1:7). In the latter case the <i>yod</i> is silent and is not perceived or felt when the word is enunciated. The same is also the case when a <i>vav</i> is prefixed to the word <i>yehudah</i>. The word is pronounced <i>viyhudah</i>.The tribes are here listed in order of their births.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In the order in which they were born to their mothers. First Leah’s children are listed in the order of their birth. Then Rachel’s son Benjamin is listed. The children of the wives are followed by the children of the handmaids. The latter are also listed in the order that their mothers bore them. Joseph is listed last because he was in Egypt when the others arrived there (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 3

ISSACHAR. Because the two <i>sins</i> in <i>yissachar</i> (Issachar) are written in succession only one is sounded. Compare, the word <i>machtzetzrim</i> (did blow) (I Chron. 15:24), which is pronounced <i>machtzerim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The word is spelled with two <i>tzadis</i> in succession. However, only one <i>tzadi</i> is sounded. Similarly, <i>yissachar</i> is pronounced <i>yisachar</i>.</i> We do not find a similar case with regard to the <i>sin</i> in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">There is no other instance in Scripture where two <i>sins</i> are written in succession and only one is pronounced (Krinsky).</i> It is customary for the Hebrews to pronounce a <i>vav</i> prefixed to the labials which are related to the <i>vav</i>, namely, the <i>bet, mem, peh</i> with an <i>alef</i> added to it,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See note 24. The <i>vav</i> is a labial. Before a labial the <i>vav</i> is not pronounced like a labial but is pronounced “ooh” so as not to have two labials back to back.</i> and to vocalize the <i>vav</i> with a <i>shuruk</i>. Compare, <i>u-faru</i> (and they shall be fruitful) in <i>and they shall be fruitful and multiply</i> (Jeremiah 23:3); and <i>u-male’u</i> (shall be full) in <i>and the houses of the Egyptians shall he full of swarms of flies</i> (Ex. 8:17). The word <i>u-vinyamin</i> (and Benjamin) is similar. Benjamin is listed before the children of the handmaidens<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he was born last.</i> because he was a son of one of Jacob’s wives.

Verse 4

DAN. Names are connected to each other in Scripture in six different ways. All of these styles are correct. One way of listing names is, <i>Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad</i> (Gen. 10:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A connective <i>vav</i> (and) is placed before each of the names that follows the first name (Krinsky).</i> A second manner is, <i>with carbuncles, purple, and richly woven work, and fine linen</i> (Ezek. 27:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A connective <i>vav</i> is placed after the first two names in a list.</i> A third way is, <i>carnelian, topaz, and smaragd</i> (Ex. 28:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>vav</i> is placed before the last name in the list.</i> A fourth way is, <i>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse. A <i>vav</i> is placed before each of the second names in a list.</i> The fifth is, <i>Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia</i> (Psalms 45:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> is omitted before the last name. The verse literally reads, <i>Myrrh, and aloes, cassia are all thy garments</i>.</i> The sixth way is, <i>Adam, Seth, Enosh</i> (I Chron. 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">No connective <i>vav</i> is employed.</i>

Verse 5

WERE. The word <i>yehi</i> (let it be)<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yehi</i> (were) is the word <i>yehi</i> with a conversive <i>vav</i>.</i> should have been vocalized like the word <i>yirev</i> (the multitude)<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">When a word from a root that ends in a <i>heh</i> is conjugated in the shortened third person imperfect <i>kal</i> form, the <i>yod</i> prefix is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> and the first root letter with a <i>segol</i>. Compare, <i>yiven</i> (he will build), <i>yigel</i> (he will uncover). Thus <i>yehi</i> should have been vocalized <i>yihey</i>.</i> in <i>and the multitude of the burdens against him</i> (II Chron. 24:27). However, since the <i>heh</i> is a guttural, the word <i>yehi</i> is vocalized with a <i>segol</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It is so vocalized when a pausal.</i> beneath the first <i>yod</i> and the word is read <i>yehi</i>. Furthermore, the final <i>yod</i> of <i>yehi</i> should have been pronounced with a sounded <i>sheva nach</i> (a quiescent <i>sheva</i>) as is the case with the word <i>yirev</i>. The word should thus have been pronounced <i>yihey</i>. However, because of the difficulty involved in the enunciation of the word in the aforementioned manner, the <i>yod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the last <i>yod</i>.</i> was silenced and we vocalized the <i>heh</i> with a <i>chirik</i>. Hence the word is pronounced <i>yehi</i> (<i>sheva</i> beneath the <i>yod</i>) as in, <i>Behold, would it might be</i> (yehi) <i>according to thy word</i> (Gen. 30:34), or <i>yehi</i> (<i>segol</i> beneath the <i>yod</i>), as in <i>For He spoke, and it was</i> (va-yehi) (Ps. 33:9). The accent is placed on the last syllable of <i>yehi</i> and a <i>sheva</i> is placed beneath its <i>yod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the <i>yod</i> prefix.</i> because the word is used often in conversation, as in <i>So be</i> (yehi khen) <i>the Lord</i> (Ex. 10:10). Therefore only this root and the root of <i>va-yechi</i> in <i>And Jacob lived</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>chet, yod, heh</i>.</i> (Gen. 47: 28) are found to have an imperfect <i>yod</i> prefix vocalized with a <i>sheva</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">An imperfect <i>yod</i> prefix is usually vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> in the <i>kal</i>.</i> when conjugated in the <i>kal</i>. The reason for this is that two letters of the two roots <i>va-yechi</i> and <i>va-yehi</i> consist of the quiescent letters <i>yod, heh</i>, the root of one being <i>heh, yod, heh</i> and that of the other <i>chet, yod, heh</i>. Now since the <i>yod</i> and the <i>heh</i> are quiescent letters and are at times not pronounced at the end of a word, the <i>yod</i> prefix is vocalized with a <i>shev</i>a. We do not find any such other case in the <i>kal</i>.
THAT CAME OUT OF THE LOINS OF JACOB. Loins allude to the male organ which is located near the loins.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, loins is a euphemism for penis.</i> It is similar to <i>and Saul went to cover his feet</i> (I Sam. 24:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Here <i>feet</i> is a euphemism for penis.</i>The offspring of Jacob who descended to Egypt really numbered sixty-nine, not including Jacob who should be counted first. The Pentateuch therefore first states <i>et ya’akov</i> (with Jacob), the meaning of which is as we have noted earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on verse 1.</i> In the first listing of Jacob’s descendants in the Torah portion <i>va-yiggash</i> (then Judah came near unto him) (Gen. 44:18), Scripture states, <i>And these are the names of the children of Israel who came unto Egypt, Jacob and his sons</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 46 lists the descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt. Like Ex. 1:4, it gives their number as 70. In introducing the names of those who came to Egypt it tells us that the list includes <i>Jacob and his sons</i>.</i> (Gen. 46:8). Thus with Jacob, <i>all the souls of his sons and his daughters</i> (descended from Jacob and Leah) <i>were thirty and three</i> (Gen. 46:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Those descended from Jacob and Leah actually numbered 32. They number 33 only if Jacob is included in the count.</i> The verse <i>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten souls</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. Since Jacob had a soul he must be included in the 70 souls that came down to Egypt.</i> (Deuteronomy 10:22) is proof that Jacob is counted among the seventy, for Jacob had a soul. Similarly, Joseph and his two sons who were in Egypt are also included in the seventy.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Joseph is mentioned after the number 70.</i>

Verse 6

AND JOSEPH DIED AND ALL THAT GENERATION. A father and his son comprise two generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, a generation does not refer to a fixed number of years.</i> Proof of this<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">That a generation does not refer to a fixed number of years.</i> is the fact that after Job’s fortune was changed for the better, he <i>lived a hundred and forty years</i> and saw four generations<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The four generations come to 140 years (Weiser). However, elsewhere in Scripture four generations come to more than 140 years. For example, the four generations that the Israelites dwelt in Egypt lasted 210 years. For other interpretations see Netter and Krinsky.</i> (Job 42:16). Furthermore, our sages tell us that there were ten generations from Adam to Noah and ten generations from Noah to Abraham (Abot 5:2, 3). Now the years of each of the aforementioned generations were different one from the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The ten generations from Adam to Noah comprised more years than the ten generations from Noah to Abraham, for the antediluvian patriarchs lived much longer than the postdiluvian patriarchs. See chapters 5, 10, and 11 of Genesis. We thus see that a generation does not comprise a fixed number of years.</i> 
The meaning of <i>And Joseph died</i> is that he died in his greatness.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph’s death is reported before Scripture relates the rise of the new king over Egypt. Hence the implication that Joseph died while still serving in his royal position (Weiser).</i> Similarly, his brothers also did not see the evil days which followed.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Their deaths are also recorded as occurring before the rise of the new king (Weiser).</i>
[AND ALL THAT GENERATION.] This refers to the Egyptians. For Scripture goes on to note, <i>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph</i> (v. 8).

Verse 7

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE FRUITFUL. They produced children as a tree produces fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>were fruitful</i> means produced children.</i>
AND INCREASED ABUNDANTLY. <i>Va-yishretzu</i> (and increased abundantly) is similar to the word <i>yishretzu</i> (swarm) in <i>Let the waters swarm</i> (yishretzu) (Gen. 1:20). However, in the first instance<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yishretzu</i> in our verse.</i> the verb is independent.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">It is intransitive.</i> It is like the verbs went, sat, stood, and lay. In the second instance<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yishretzu</i> in Gen. 1:20.</i> the verb is dependent upon something else. It is like the verbs ate, kept, and hired. We thus say, he ate the bread, he kept the thing, and he hired the donkey. The latter are called transitive verbs. Now <i>yishretzu</i> (swarm) in <i>yishretzu ha-mayim</i> (Let the waters swarm) is a transitive verb, while <i>va-yishretzu</i> (and increased abundantly) is an intransitive verb. Thus the root <i>shin, resh, zadi</i> is sometimes transitive and sometimes intransitive. It is like the root of the word <i>shav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>shin, vav, bet</i>.</i> which is at times intransitive as in <i>and (God) will return</i> (ve-shav) <i>and gather</i> (Deut. 30:3) and at times transitive, as in <i>that then the Lord thy God will turn</i> (ve-shav) <i>thy captivity</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). It is possible that the word <i>va-yishretzu</i> alludes to the fact that the Israelite wives gave birth to twins and even more.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Since the root of <i>va-yishretzu</i> is <i>shin, resh, zadi</i> our verse is to be rendered, the children of Israel swarmed (<i>va-yishretzu</i>); i.e., they multiplied like insects. See also Rashi, quoting <i>Shemot Rabbah</i>, that they bore six children at each birth.</i> I myself have seen the quadruplets that a women gave birth to. Physicians tell us that a woman can have as many as seven fetuses in her womb at one time.
AND MULTIPLIED. They did not die in proportion to that of a large nation.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">They multiplied because they had a low death rate.</i>
AND WAXED EXCEEDINGLY MIGHTY. They had strong bones.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>va-ya’atzmu</i> (and waxed mighty) as, and they had (large) bones, for <i>va-ya’atzmu</i> comes from the root <i>ayin, tzadi, mem</i> meaning bone.</i>
[EXCEEDINGLY.] The phrase <i>bi-me’od me’od</i> (exceedingly) indicates that there could not possibly have been any more of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reason that the word <i>me’od</i> (exceedingly) is repeated.</i> The <i>bet</i> of <i>bi-me’od me’od</i> is like the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-rishonah</i> (first) in <i>and they took their first journey</i> (Num. 10:13), for we also encounter the term with out the <i>bet</i> in <i>they shall set forth first</i> (rishonah) (Num. 2:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bet</i> is superfluous. The text could have read, <i>me’od me’od</i> (exceedingly), and the meaning would have remained the same. See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 1:1 and the notes thereto.</i>
AND THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH THEM. The land of Goshen, also known as the land of Rameses.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rameses where Israel dwelt is not to be identified with the store-city Raamses (v. 12) which Israel built for Pharaoh. See I.E. on Gen. 47:1.</i> Rameses is sounded with a quiescent <i>sheva</i> beneath the <i>ayin</i>, for the first <i>sheva</i> in Rameses, the <i>sheva</i> beneath the <i>ayin</i> which is connected to the <i>resh</i>, is called a <i>sheva nach</i>. The second <i>sheva</i>, the one beneath the <i>mem</i>, is called a <i>sheva na</i> (mobile <i>sheva</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Or vocative <i>sheva</i>.</i> because the lips seem to begin to first move when it is uttered.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Na</i> means to move. A <i>sheva na</i> opens a syllable. The lips begin to move when a new syllable is pronounced.</i>

Verse 8

NOW THERE AROSE A NEW KING.

I.E. is probably referring to Num. 10:29 which reads, <i>come thou with us</i>. I.E.’s point is that both <i>havah</i> and <i>lekhah</i> come from stems that have a <i>yod</i> as their first letter and a <i>heh</i> added to their roots in the masculine singular imperative form; i.e., at times we say <i>havah</i> and <i>lekhah</i> in place of <i>hav</i> and <i>lekh</i>.</i> In the feminine we say <i>havi</i>, as in <i>Bring</i> (havi) <i>the mantle that is upon thee</i> (Ruth 3:15), and <i>lekhi</i> (go), as in <i>Go and get thee in</i> (I Kings 1:23).

Verse 14

AND THEY MADE THEIR LIVES BITTER. It is known that the <i>tav</i>, in a majority of instances, is the sign of the feminine plural and the <i>mem</i> of the masculine plural.

This grammarian held that a word with a feminine plural ending must similarly have a feminine ending in the singular. <i>Mo’adot</i> is a feminine plural form. <i>Mo’ed</i> is a masculine singular form. These two forms are inconsistent. The unnamed sage thus postulated that a female form <i>mo’adah</i> existed, the plural of which is <i>mo’adot</i>.

WHEREIN THEY MADE THEM SERVE. The word <i>avedu</i> (they made them serve) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse is to be read as if it were written: wherein they made them serve, they made them serve with rigor. When a verb from the root <i>ayin, bet, dalet</i> is not followed by a <i>bet</i> it refers to work performed by a slave. This is the meaning of <i>avadatikha</i> (I have served thee) (Gen. 30:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob used this term when speaking to Laban. What he meant was, I slaved for you.</i> However, when the verb is followed by a <i>bet</i> it has one of the following two meanings.

The words <i>with rigor</i> come from Lev. 25:43.

The word <i>ever</i> in Hebrew can refer to a person or to the side of a river. Gen. 10:21 reads, <i>And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber</i> (ever)…<i>also were born children</i>. Now Shem lived before Eber was born. I.E. assumed that Scripture would not report someone as being the ancestor of a person not yet born. Hence Eber in this verse cannot refer to a person. It refers to those born on one of the sides of the Euphrates. This interpretation contradicts the one I.E. gives in Genesis and elsewhere in Exodus. Cf. Gen. 10:21 and Ex. 21:2. Krinsky suggests emending “hence” to “or.” In other words, I.E. offers an alternative interpretation to the one he gave in Genesis and will offer later on in Exodus. Filwarg, on the other hand, suggests emending the text to read: Hence they err who say that <i>the children of Eber</i>, in <i>the father of all the children of Eber</i>, refers to those who came from the side of the river. For the side of the river refers to one of the sides of the river. In other words, <i>ever</i> cannot refer only to the western bank of the river where Abraham came from. A river has two sides and <i>ever</i> might refer to the eastern bank of the river, which is not the place that the Hebrews originally came from.</i>
[THE BIRTHSTOOL.] Ben Kuraish<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">An eighth-century North African grammarian.</i> says that the <i>alef</i> of <i>ovnayim</i> (birthstool) is superfluous because <i>ovnayim</i> comes from the same root as <i>banim</i> (sons).<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which does not have an <i>alef</i>.

[THEN SHE SHALL LIVE.] The word <i>va-chayah</i> (then she shall live) is irregular and presents a very difficult grammatical problem. The rules of grammar require <i>va-chayetah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-chayah</i> is masculine. <i>Va-chayetah</i> is feminine. Since the Bible speaks of <i>a daughter</i> the latter form should have been used.</i> because the <i>heh</i> of the root<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">In a root ending in a <i>heh</i>.</i> changes to a <i>tav</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">In the third person feminine perfect.</i> as it does in the construct in the case of the word <i>chayat</i> (beast of)<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>chet, yod, heh</i>.</i> in <i>and to every beast of the earth</i> (Gen. 1:30). The reason for the change is that the <i>heh</i> and the <i>tav</i> are similar in appearance when written. The only difference between them is the extension of the dot that is within the <i>heh</i>. For the letter <i>tav</i> is first a <i>heh</i>. It is only when the dot is extended that it becomes a <i>tav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i> is open on the left side with the exception of a tiny line (referred to as a dot by I.E.) at the bottom. The <i>tav</i> is closed on both the right and left sides. Thus by drawing from the small line (the dot) to the top of the letter, the <i>heh</i> becomes a <i>tav</i>.</i> However, the <i>tav</i> and the <i>heh</i> are pronounced completely differently.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">The letters cannot be confused when spoken because they are sounded differently. But they can be confused when written, for they have similar forms.</i> They also have different names.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Hence a person cannot mistake one for the other. Upon hearing <i>heh</i>, one will not think he heard <i>tav</i>.</i> This proves that our form of the letters is the original Hebrew script.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">There is a controversy in the Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 22a) over whether the original script of the Torah was identical to the script currently in use (the so-called Assyrian script), or whether the Torah was originally written in a script known as “Hebrew script.” In the Assyrian script the <i>heh</i> and the <i>tav</i> resemble each other. In the “Hebrew script” they are totally different. The fact that the Torah substitutes a <i>heh</i> for a <i>tav</i> because they resemble each other shows that the Torah was originally written in the Assyrian script. Historically speaking, the opinion that the Torah was given in “Hebrew script” is right, for all Hebrew writing extant from the period of the first commonwealth is in the “Hebrew script.”</i>Generally speaking, the root of the word <i>chai</i> (lived) and the root of the word <i>chayyim</i> (life) are in doubt, for the grammarians have concluded that the root of the word <i>chai</i> (lived) in <i>And Arpachshad lived</i> (Gen. 11:12) is <i>chet, yod, yod</i>. The word <i>tam</i> (spent) in <i>how that our money is all spent</i> (Gen. 47:18) is similar, for it comes from the root <i>tav, mem, mem</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Similar in that both words have a doubled root letter.</i> The grammarians also agree that the plural of the root <i>chet, yod, yod</i> is <i>chayyim</i> (life). However, in my opinion we are dealing with an irregular root.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">In the third person and participle <i>kal</i> forms, the word <i>chai</i> is written as if it came from the root <i>chet, yod, yod</i>. On the other hand, it is conjugated in the other <i>kal</i> forms as if it came from the root <i>chet, yod, heh</i>.</i> If this is not so<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">If this root is not irregular.</i> let someone show me a case where this root is conjugated in the imperfect according to the paradigm of <i>chet, gimel, gimel</i>, namely, <i>achog</i> (I will celebrate), <i>tachog</i> (you will celebrate), <i>yachog</i> (he will celebrate), <i>la-chog</i> (to celebrate).<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">This is the form of a double root in the <i>kal</i> imperfect.</i> If the root of <i>chai</i> were <i>chet, yod, yod</i>, it should be conjugated <i>achoy, yachoy, la-choy</i> in the imperfect or like <i>sov</i> (go about) or <i>sobu</i> (walk about) in <i>Walk about Zion</i> (Ps. 48:13) and <i>sobbi</i> (go about)<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Another example of a double root. For the root of <i>sov</i> or <i>sobbi</i> is <i>samekh, bet, bet. Sov</i> and <i>sobbi</i> are imperative forms.</i> in <i>Go about the city</i> (Is. 23:16). This is proof that the word <i>chai</i> comes from a root ending in a <i>heh</i>. The fact that we do not find the root of <i>chai</i> conjugated in any of the above-mentioned forms is proof that it belongs to those verbs whose stems end in a <i>heh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">That is, its root is <i>chet, yod, heh</i>. I.E. is usually not this verbose and repetitious. Filwarg suggests that from “the fact” until “for we say” is an explanatory gloss that was incorporated into the text. The original reading was: This is proof that the word <i>chai</i> comes from a root ending in a <i>heh.</i>, for we say <i>echyeh, nichyeh</i>, etc.</i> for we say <i>echeyeh</i> (I will live), <i>nichyeh</i> (we will live), <i>eheyeh</i> (I will be), <i>tiheyeh</i> (you will be), <i>yiheyeh</i> (he will be), all of which come from the root <i>heh, yod, heh</i>. Now if this is the case it comes from the root <i>chet, yod, heh</i> and is like the word <i>haya</i> (was).<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is conjugated according to the paradigm of <i>hayah</i>.</i> The fact that we find the word <i>chai</i> (lived) employed as a third person perfect in <i>arpachshad chai</i> (Arpachshad lived) (Gen. 11:12) does not disturb us.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">It does not disprove I.E.’s contention that the root of the word is <i>chet, yod, heh</i>.</i> We are not bothered by the aforementioned even though it appears that <i>chai</i> comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chai</i> is the normal conjugation of the word if it comes from the root <i>chet, yod, yod</i>. I.E. is not disturbed by this because he believes this root to be irregular. See note 155.</i> What forced me to come to this conclusion is the fact that I saw that there is no root in Hebrew that ends in a <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Or in a <i>yod</i>. See further in I.E.’s note.</i> The word <i>shalev</i> (at ease) (Job 16:12) does not disprove my contention.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shalev</i> appears to come from the root <i>shin, lamed, vav</i>.</i> Its <i>vav</i> is in place of a <i>heh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Hence its root is <i>shin, lamed, heh</i>.</i> since the letters <i>alef, heh, vav, yod</i> interchange. Proof that what I say is correct is the word <i>shalu</i> (secure) in <i>Wherefore are all they secure that deal treacherously</i> (Job 12:1). For the root of <i>shalu</i> is <i>shin, lamed, heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shalev</i> is the noun form of the verb <i>shalu</i>. Hence the root of <i>shalev</i> must be the same as the root of <i>shalu</i>.</i>I will now explain to you why a <i>vav</i> is never employed as a third letter of a root. The latter is so because the <i>vav</i> serves as a third person singular suffix, as in the words <i>avdo va-amato</i> (his man-servant nor his maid-servant) (Ex. 20:14). The <i>vav</i> also serves as the sign of the plural, as in <i>peru u-revu</i> (be fruitful and multiply) (Gen. 1:22). There are also superfluous <i>vavs</i>, as in <i>beno be’or</i> (the son of Beor) (Num. 24:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>ben</i>. Hence the <i>vav</i> of <i>beno</i> is superfluous.</i> Now if the <i>vav</i> was also used as the final letter of a root it would be confused with one of the three types of <i>vavs</i> that we have just mentioned, namely, the <i>vav</i> indicating a third person singular suffix, the <i>vav</i> indicating a plural, and the superfluous <i>vav</i>; we could not then ascertain the meaning of the word.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">We would not be able to tell whether the <i>vav</i> is a root letter or a suffix (Krinsky).</i> The same is also true of the <i>yod</i>. The <i>yod</i> cannot serve as the final letter of a stem because it is used as a first person singular suffix, as in the word <i>yadi</i> (my hand) (Gen. 42:37). It is also employed as a first person plural suffix, as in the word <i>yadai</i> (my hands) (Deut. 9:15). It is also the sign of the plural construct, as in <i>yede</i> (the hands of) in <i>The hands of women full of compassion</i> (Lamentations 4:10). It is used as the sign of the feminine imperative, as in <i>de’i and re’i</i> (know and consider) (I Sam. 25:17). It is used to indicate relationship, as in <i>ha-ivri o ha-ivriyah</i> (a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman) (Deut. 15:22). The <i>yod</i> is also used superfluously in verbs, as in <i>ha-magbihi</i> (that is enthroned) (Ps. 113:5) and in <i>le-hoshivi</i> (that He may set him) (Ps. 113:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">The normal forms are <i>ha-magbi’ah</i> and <i>le-hoshiv</i>. Hence the <i>yods</i> are superfluous.</i> It is used superfluously with nouns, as in <i>beni atono</i> (his ass’s colt) (Gen. 49:11)<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>ben</i>. Hence the <i>yod</i> is superfluous.</i> and also with particles, as in <i>zulati</i> (save) (Deut. 1:36) and <i>minni ephrayim</i> (out of Ephraim) (Judges 5:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>zulat</i> and <i>min</i>. Hence the <i>yods</i> are superfluous.</i> For these reasons the <i>yod</i> is not employed as a final root letter lest it be confused with one of the above-noted <i>yods</i>. Therefore I maintain that the word <i>va-chayah</i> (then shall she live) is irregular and is a variant of <i>va-chayetah</i>. It belongs, as I have already explained, in the family of verbs ending in a <i>heh</i>.

Verse 17

BUT THE MIDWIVES FEARED GOD. The <i>alef</i> in <i>va-tirena</i> (feared) is not sounded lest the verb be thought to come from the root <i>resh, alef, heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>alef</i> is sounded, <i>va-tirena</i> is pronounced <i>va-tir-enah</i> and appears to come from the root <i>resh, alef, heh</i>, meaning: and they saw. The root of <i>va-tirena</i> is <i>yod, resh, alef</i>.</i>
BUT SAVED. Even more than at first, they now worked with all of their strength to save the children. Otherwise what need was there for Scripture to be so verbose?<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote"><i>But saved the man-children</i> coming after <i>and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them</i> appears to be redundant unless it adds something new.</i>

Verse 18

AND THE KING OF EGYPT CALLED FOR THE MIDWIVES, AND SAID UNTO THEM. You deserve to die<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Following Filwarg, who emends <i>ha-nakhon</i> to <i>hinkhen</i>.</i> because you have not obeyed my command.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">The king was not asking a question when he said, <i>why have ye done this thing</i>, etc. What he meant was, why have you violated my command and thereby incurred the death penalty.</i> There is no difference in the form of the word <i>va-tomarnah</i> (said) in which the <i>vav</i> is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> when it is in the third person perfect, like the word <i>va-tokhalnah</i> (did eat) in <i>And the ill-favoured, and lean-fleshed kine did eat</i> (Gen. 41:4), and when it is used as a second person perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">The second and third person feminine perfects are formed by adding a conversive <i>vav</i> to the corresponding imperfect form. Thus <i>va-tomarnah</i> may mean either “and they said” or “and you (plural) said,” for <i>tomarnah</i> means either “they will say” or “you (plural) will say.” However, they differ in the regular perfect, for the normal second person form is <i>amarten</i> and the regular third person form is <i>ameru</i>. The same, of course, applies to the word <i>va-techayyenah</i> (and have saved). Indeed, I.E.’s comments are directed to explain this word, for <i>va-techayyenah</i> in our verse means “and ye have saved” while in verse 17 it means “and they saved.” Hence I.E.’s paraphrase: “why have ye done this thing and saved.”</i> The meaning of our verse is: Why have ye done this thing and preserved the man-children alive?

Verse 19

AND THE MIDWIVES SAID UNTO PHARAOH. We have not violated your command because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they have greater vitality. The <i>yod</i> of the word <i>chayot</i> (lively) in <i>For they are lively</i> does not have a <i>dagesh</i>. This is correct Hebrew usage. Compare, <i>davot</i> (ill), <i>ravot</i> (satiated), and <i>alot</i> (giving suck) in <i>the flocks and herds giving suck are a care to me</i> (Gen. 33:13). However, the <i>yod</i> in the word <i>chayyim</i> does receive a <i>dagesh</i> because <i>chayyim</i> is an adjective. Compare, <i>ve-nitpesem chayyim</i> (we shall take them alive) (II Kings 7:12) in which the <i>yod</i> in <i>chayyim</i> (alive) is like the <i>yod</i> of <i>ha-ivriyyim</i> (the Hebrews) in <i>the God of the Hebrews</i> (Ex. 3:18). The word <i>chayyim</i> (life) also receives a <i>dagesh</i> when it is a noun, as in <i>etz chayyim</i> (a tree of life) (Prov. 3:18). Similarly, the <i>tzadi</i> of <i>tzitzim</i> (flowers) in <i>and open flowers</i> (II Kings 6:18) receives a <i>dagesh</i>.
AND ARE DELIVERED. <i>Ve-yaladu</i> (and are delivered) is a feminine perfect. The third person perfect has the same form in the masculine and the feminine. Compare, <i>tavu</i> (did spin) (Ex. 35:25) and <i>tzave’u</i> (did service) (Ex. 38:8).

Verse 20

AND GOD DEALT WELL. When a root begins with a <i>yod</i>, the <i>yod</i> does not always drop out when the verb is conjugated,<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>hifil</i>.</i> The word <i>va-yetev</i> (dealt well) is an example. At other times a <i>vav</i> is substituted for the <i>yod</i>, as in <i>va-yoshev</i> (He maketh to dwell) in <i>And there He maketh the hungry to dwell</i> (Ps. 107:36). The root of <i>va-yoshev</i> is <i>yod, shin, bet</i>, as the root of <i>va-yetev</i> is <i>yod, tet, bet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">In most instances the first <i>yod</i> of a root beginning with a <i>yod</i> changes to a <i>vav</i> when the word is conjugated in the <i>hifil</i>. However, <i>va-yetev</i>, which comes from the root <i>yod, tet, bet</i> and is a <i>hifil</i> form retains its <i>yod</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i><i>And God dealt well</i> is explained by what follows next, i.e., <i>He</i> (God) <i>made them houses</i>. The meaning of <i>He made them houses</i> is similar to <i>that the Lord make thee a house</i> (II Sam. 7:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Wherein “house” refers to an important family (Weiser).</i>

Verse 21

AND IT CAME TO PASS, BECAUSE THE MIDWIVES FEARED GOD. Because the midwives did not fear the king of Egypt but feared the Lord, the Lord dealt well with them. Note that the verb <i>yare’u</i> (feared) is neither transitive nor intransitive, because its meaning is, to be afraid of someone.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">The verb <i>yare</i> means to be afraid of someone. The one who is frightened does nothing to the source of his fright. Hence the verb is not transitive. On the other hand, the frightened person does nothing to himself; i.e., he does not scare himself.

Et</i> connects a transitive verb with the direct object. However, <i>yare</i>, as I.E. has noted, is not transitive. Hence I.E. notes that <i>et</i> is short for <i>me’et.</i>, the literal meaning of our text being: were afraid of God.</i> Obadiah used a short form when he said, <i>yare et Adonai</i> (fear the Lord) (I Kings 18:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Here too <i>et</i> is short for <i>me’et</i>.</i> It is for this reason that the word <i>nora</i> (revered)<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">As a verb. <i>Nifal</i> is the passive form of the <i>kal</i>.

Verse 2

AND THE WOMAN CONCEIVED. There is no doubt that Aaron was older than Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading of <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38.

Krinsky and Netter attempt to explain it and in my opinion fail to do so. The reading of the Vatican manuscript appears to be correct, and the words <i>kemo she-hizkarnu</i> are most likely a gloss by a scribe who thought that “there is no doubt” refers to what I.E. said earlier namely, that Amram married his aunt.</i> Our sages similarly received a tradition that Puah<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">One of the midwives (v. 15).</i> and Miriam are one and the same person.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 11b.</i> It is also written, <i>And his sister stood afar off</i> (v. 4).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that Miriam was older than Moses.</i>Now we know that the four hundred-year period<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 15:13.</i> which ended in Israel’s redemption started with the day that Isaac was born, for Isaac alone is considered to be Abraham’s seed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 21:12.</i> Now Isaac was sixty years old when he begot Jacob,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 25:26.</i> and Jacob was eighty-five years old when he begot Reuben,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob came to Egypt at the age of 130 (Gen. 47:9).

Jacob was thus 91 years older than Joseph. Joseph was six years younger than Reuben since Reuben was born in the eighth year of Jacob’s stay with Laban, and Joseph in the fourteenth year of that stay (See I.E. on Gen. 30:23 and the notes thereto).

Note that the <i>nun</i> is often dropped or is swallowed by a <i>dagesh</i> when it is the first root letter of a verb, as in the case of the <i>nun</i> of <i>gesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>nun, gimel, shin</i>.</i> in <i>gesh holah</i> (stand back) (Gen. 19:9) and <i>va-yiggash</i> (came near)<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>nun, gimel, shin</i>. The <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>gimel</i> compensates for the missing <i>nun</i>.</i> in <i>Then Judah came near unto him</i> (Gen. 44:18).

Observe, the middle <i>nun</i> is swallowed. Therefore the <i>peh</i> of <i>appo</i> (his wrath) in <i>that his wrath was kindled</i> (Gen. 39:19) and the <i>peh</i> of <i>appekah</i> (thine anger) in <i>Thine anger is turned away</i> (Is. 12:1) receive a <i>dagesh</i>. The same is true of the <i>nun</i> of the root <i>nun, tav, nun</i> in the word <i>titti</i> (that I give) (Gen. 29:19), for <i>titti</i> is like <i>tinti</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it comes from the root <i>nun, tav, nun</i>.

It does not come from a root ending in a <i>tav</i>, for its last <i>tav</i> is a first person suffix.</i> is not a root letter. It is rather like the <i>tavs</i> of <i>shivti</i> (my downsitting) (Ps. 139:2), <i>lekhti</i> (when I went) (I Kings 2:8), and <i>lidti</i> (I delivered) (I Kings 3:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In all of these cases the last <i>tav</i> is a first person suffix.</i> It is also so at the end of the word,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Not only does the first <i>nun</i> of the root <i>nun, tav, nun</i> at times drop out but its final <i>nun</i> is also omitted at times.</i> as in <i>tet</i> (to put) in <i>to put the dread of thee</i> (Deut. 2:25) and in <i>titti</i> (that I give) in <i>that I give her to thee</i> (Gen. 29:19). The same is true of nouns. The word for daughter (<i>bat</i>) should have been <i>banah</i> since the feminine of <i>ben</i> (son) is <i>banah</i>. However, in this case it would have been confused with the verb <i>banah</i> (hath built), as in <i>that hath built</i> (banah) <i>a new house</i> (Deut. 20:5). A <i>tav</i> was therefore substituted for the <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the basic word for daughter is <i>banat</i>, not <i>banah</i>. I.E. will soon explain why the <i>nun</i> was dropped from <i>banat</i>, the Hebrew word for daughter being <i>bat</i>.</i> It is similar to <i>givirah</i> (lady) and <i>geveret</i> (lady) as well as to <i>atarah</i> (crown) and <i>ateret</i> (crown) in which we find both the construct and the absolute forms used in the absolute.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bat</i> is usually in the absolute.

So too, <i>bat</i> means both daughter and daughter of.</i> Compare, <i>ateret</i> (crown of) in <i>A crown of glory</i> (Prov. 4:7). It should be noted that the <i>nun</i> was also dropped for the sake of easing the pronunciation of the word.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Not only was the <i>heh</i> of <i>banah</i> changed to a <i>tav</i>, but its <i>nun</i> was dropped.

The word <i>bitto</i> (his daughter) in <i>Rachel his daughter</i> (Gen. 29:6) is similar to the word <i>amitto</i> (his truth) which is the word <i>emet</i> (truth) with the third person pronominal suffix.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bitto</i> comes from the root <i>bet, nun, heh.

AND THE WOMAN CONCEIVED. Scripture does not mention the birth of Miriam and Aaron because there was nothing special about their birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">It appears from our verse that Moses was Amram and Jochebed’s firstborn as Aaron and Miriam’s births are not mentioned. However, this cannot be the case since we have already seen that they were older than Moses. I.E. explains that there was no reason for Scripture to tell of their births as nothing extraordinary happened when they came into this world. However, when Moses was born he was put into the Nile and discovered by Pharaoh’s daughter.</i>When the word <i>tov</i> (good)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Moses is described as “ a goodly (<i>tov</i>) child,” hence I.E.’s comment.</i> is used with reference to a mature man it probably refers to the soul, as in “good with the Lord and good with man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

THREE MONTHS. Some say that Moses was born in the seventh month following his conception.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible tells us that Moses’ mother hid him for three months. The question arises, why did Jochebed hide Moses for three months? Why not two or four or five months? These commentaries assume that the Egyptians knew when Jochebed conceived and that they would come to check on the sex of her child nine months later. Hence they assume that Moses was born six months after conception and his mother hid him for three months, i.e., until the time the Egyptians would come to check the birth and ascertain the sex of the child. Cf. Rashi and Rashbam.</i> However, this interpretation like so many others is Midrashic,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">It looks like a literal interpretation but upon reflection it is Midrashic.</i> for the Egyptians had no way of determining when the woman<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Jochebed.</i> conceived. In my opinion Scripture relates the months that she was able to hide the child<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Moses.</i> since it is impossible for anyone to predict when a women will give birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the Egyptians had no way of knowing when Jochebed would give birth just by looking at her.</i> It is also far-fetched to say that Moses was born in the seventh month following conception because those so born are undersized.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “because those then born are short.” However, Moses, as the verse tells us, was a perfect specimen.</i> Those born in the eleventh month are healthier and live longer, as most children are born close to the ninth month.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. obviously believed that a woman can carry a fetus for 11 months. His point is that the longer a child spends in the womb the healthier it will be. Hence Moses, who was “good,” could not have been premature. It is interesting that I.E. does not consider the possibility of divine intervention in making Moses a perfect specimen though born prematurely.</i> One who knows the time of conception is able to ascertain the time of birth, and one who knows the time of birth can ascertain the time of conception. This was established by the ancients. I myself have tried it five times.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. might be referring to his personal life. If this is the case then we may conclude that he had fathered five children by the time he composed the long commentary on Exodus. See the introduction to Vol. 1 of this work. It is also possible that people consulted I.E. to make horoscopes for their children and that the reference is to the latter. In this case we, of course, have no hint as to how many children I.E. had.</i> For the degree and place of the moon and its constellation at the moment of conception is also the degree of the constellation that flowers at the moment of begetting The degree which flowers at the moment of impregnation will also be the degree at which the moon will be found at the time of birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">A flowering constellation is one that is present at the moment of conception. The point is that the moon will be in the same place in the sky and will have the same constellation as its background at birth as it did at conception. Hence if one knows the moment of conception, one can ascertain the time of one’s birth. Similarly, if one knows the time of birth, one can figure out the time of conception.</i> Now the time set aside<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. reads, <i>ha-kotzev</i>, (the time set aside). However, since I.E. gives three time periods, what he must mean is the minimum time. Filwarg suggests reading <i>ha-katan</i> (the minimum) in place of <i>ha-kotzev</i>.</i> for carrying a child is two hundred and fifty nine and a third days.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">About eight and two-thirds of a month.</i> The median time for pregnancy is two hundred and seventy-three days.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">A little more than nine months.</i> The maximum time for being with child is two hundred and eighty-seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Nine and a half months.</i> Those learned in astrology will admit this.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Some versions have “teach this;” i.e., they read <i>yoru</i> rather than <i>yodu</i>.</i> The birth of the tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob’s 12 sons.</i> does not refute this,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob begot 12 sons from four wives in seven years.

See I.E. on Gen. 30:23 and the notes thereto.</i> because the order of their listing is no proof that they were born prematurely.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The interpretation that Jacob’s children were born seven months apart is based on the theory that their births are listed in Genesis in the order of their occurrence; i.e., Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah were born first, to Leah. Rachel then gave Bilhah to Jacob, and Bilhah bore Dan. And so on with the rest of the sons of Jacob. I.E. says that the latter is not necessarily the case. It is possible that Bilhah was given to Jacob when Simeon was born and that Scripture does not note this earlier because it wanted to record that Leah had four sons before she “left off bearing.” See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 30:23 and the notes thereto.</i> We find many such instances in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">There are many instances in Scripture where what happened later is listed first and what happened earlier is listed later.</i> It is therefore possible that Rachel gave her handmaid to Jacob when Simeon was born, that Issachar was born before Asher,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In Gen. 30:13 Asher’s birth is recorded before that of Issaschar (Gen. 30:18).</i> and that Dinah was Zebulun’s twin.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">After recording that Leah gave birth to Zebulun, Genesis tells us, <i>And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah</i> (Gen. 30:21). <i>Prima facie</i>, it appears that Dinah was born some time after the birth of Zebulun. I.E. argues that this is not so. He suggests that <i>afterwards</i> means a few moments later, as it does in Gen. 30:21.</i> Hence the phrase <i>and afterwards</i> in <i>and afterwards she bore a daughter</i> (Gen. 30:21) is similar to <i>And after that came forth his brother</i> (Gen. 25:26). For <i>and she conceived</i> is not mentioned for each one. Also, <i>And it came to pass, when the seasons were come about</i> (I Sam. 1:20) refers to three seasons.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the birth of the prophet Samuel. According to the Talmudic sage Mar Zutra, Samuel was born six months and two days after he was conceived. The Bible tells us that Hannah, Samuel’s mother, prayed for a son and that “<i>seasons</i> (tekufat) <i>of days came to pass, and Hannah conceived and bore a son</i> (I Sam. 20). Mar Zutra explains that <i>tekufot</i> (seasons) refers to six months (a <i>tekufah</i>, a season is three months) and days, to two days. Cf. <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 11a. I.E. disagrees. According to him, <i>seasons</i> refers to three seasons (nine months). Hence Samuel was not born prematurely.</i>

Verse 3

[HIDE HIM.] The <i>tzadi</i> of <i>hatzefino</i> (hide him), like the <i>kof</i> in the word <i>yikkrekh</i> (happen to thee) in <i>there shall no punishment happen to thee</i> (I Sam. 28:10), receives a <i>dagesh</i> so that these words may be clearly pronounced.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">A letter with a <i>dagesh</i> in it is emphasized; i.e., the word is sounded <i>hatzefino</i> (<i>dagesh</i> in <i>tzadi</i>) rather than <i>hatzpino</i> (no <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>tzadi</i>). I.E. makes this point because there is no grammatical reason for a <i>dagesh</i> to be placed in <i>hatzefino</i> or <i>yikkrekh</i>.</i> The <i>peh</i> in <i>hatzefino</i> should have received a <i>dagesh</i>. However, it does not because the <i>tzadi</i> is vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva. Hatzefino</i> is a <i>hifil</i> infinitive. There is no reason to speculate as to why Jochebed did not hide him for a longer period of time.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. comments thus because he disagrees with the exegetes who believed that Jochebed carried Moses for six months and hid him for three months because the Egyptians were about to come and check on the baby’s birth and sex. See note 50.</i> Perhaps the Egyptian neighbors heard his voice,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Jochebed could no longer hide him.</i> for the Hebrews were not the only inhabitants of the land of Rameses.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">There were also Egyptians living there and they would report the birth of the child.

We thus see that the Hebrews had Egyptian neighbors.</i>
[AN ARK OF BULRUSHES.] The words <i>tevat gome</i> (an ark of bulrushes) are penultimately accented because the cantillical note is placed on the first syllable of the word <i>gome</i> (bulrushes).<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. points out that not only <i>gome</i> is penultimately accented; so is <i>tevat</i>. The problem presented by the latter is that <i>tevah</i> (<i>tevat</i> is <i>tevah</i> in the construct) is usually ultimately accented. I.E. explains that when two words are connected by cantillical notes and the second word is penultimately accented, so is the first word. This is so even though the word is ordinarily ultimately accented.</i>
AND DAUBED IT. The <i>heh of va-tachmerah</i> (and daubed it) is silent. It is like the <i>heh</i> of the word <i>lah</i> (it) in <i>and called it</i> (lah) <i>Nobah, after his own name</i> (Num. 32:42).<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rules of Hebrew grammar, a <i>heh</i> which serves as a pronominal suffix is vocalized with a <i>mappik</i> and is thus sounded. However, this is not the case with the pronominal <i>heh</i> in <i>va-tachmerah</i>. I.E. thus points out that the <i>mappik</i> is occasionally omitted from the <i>heh</i> which serves as a pronominal suffix.</i> The word <i>va-tachmerah</i> (and daubed it) is derived from the word <i>ba-chemar</i> (with slime).<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the same root. In other words, the verb <i>va-tachmerah</i> is a denominative of <i>chemar</i>.</i> <i>Chemar</i> (slime) is a red sticky clay which is found in the Land of Israel.

It is possible that Miriam was instructed by God to tell her mother to do this, that, as I.E. goes on to say, the Lord arranged it that Pharaoh’s daughter find Moses and bring him up in the royal palace.</i> God’s thoughts are very deep. Who can know His secrets? By Him alone are actions weighed.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I Sam. 2:3.</i> Perhaps God arranged things so that Moses would grow up in a royal house and his spirit would thereby be exalted through learning and practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Moses would develop into an aristocratic person by learning and practicing the habits of the nobility. I.E. here reflects medieval thinking on the superior quality of the ruling class and their practices.</i> He would thus not possess a base spirit habituated to being in the house of slaves. Do you not see that Moses killed an Egyptian because the latter committed an act of violence<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 2:11, 12.</i> and that he saved the daughters of Midian from the shepherds because they were acting violently in trying to water their flocks with the water which the women had drawn?<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 2:16, 17.

After stating, <i>and saw it</i>, Scripture goes on to elucidate further.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads: <i>And she opened it, and saw it, the child. The child</i> appears redundant, for it is preceded by <i>and saw it</i>. I.E. explains that Scripture is trying to be especially clear. Hence the Pentateuch goes on to explains that <i>it</i> refers to <i>the child</i>.</i> Our verse is thus similar to <i>And the house of David shall be as a godlike being, As the angel of the Lord before them</i> (Zech. 12:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Angel of the Lord</i> goes on to explain <i>a godlike being</i>.</i>
AND BEHOLD A BOY THAT WEPT. Moses’ limbs were as large as if he were a fully developed boy.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture describes Moses as a <i>na’ar</i> (a boy). However, he was a <i>yonek</i> (an infant), hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Pharaoh’s daughter noticed that Moses was circumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Pharaoh’s daughter identified him as <i>one of the Hebrews’ children</i>.</i> She took pity on him because of his beauty.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Pharaoh’s daughter saved Moses because of his beauty.</i> This is the meaning of <i>that he was a goodly child</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on verse 2.</i>

Verse 7

THEN SAID…THAT SHE MAY NURSE. The first <i>yod</i> in roots whose first letter is a <i>yod</i> occasionally change,<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>yod</i> in <i>peh yods</i> are either occasionally dropped or changed to a <i>yod</i>.</i> as evidenced in the word <i>todi’a</i> (you shall inform) which comes from the root <i>yod, dalet, ayin</i> and is spelled with a <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>hifil</i> the <i>yod</i> changes to a <i>vav</i>.</i> In other cases a silent missing letter<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>tzere</i>. See note 88.</i> which is at times written and at times omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">See note 88. When the <i>tzere</i> is followed by a <i>yod</i> the silent letter is visible. When the <i>tzere</i> is not followed by a <i>yod</i> the silent letter is missing.</i> is substituted for the <i>yod</i> and placed between the prefix and the middle root letter. This is the case with the word <i>ve-tenek</i> (that she may nurse)<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>yod, nun, kof</i>. The <i>yod</i> of the root is swallowed by the <i>tzere</i>.</i> in <i>that she may nurse the child for thee</i>.

Verse 8

AND PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER SAID TO HER: GO. <i>Lekhi</i> (go) is like <i>shevi</i> (sit).<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lekhi</i> is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i> beneath the <i>lamed</i>. The usual way of vocalizing this form (the imperative) is with a <i>sheva</i>. I.E. points out that this is also the case with the word <i>shevi</i>. It is usually vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>. However, in Jer. 29:5 we find its plural form vocalized with a <i>tzere</i>. The reason for the change from <i>sheva</i> to <i>tzere</i> is that these words come at the end of a verse.</i> These words are the imperative forms of <i>va-yelekh</i> (and he went) and <i>va-yeshev</i> (and he dwelt).

Verse 9

TAKE. <i>Helikhi</i> (take) is like <i>heniki</i> (nurse)<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ve-henikehu</i> (and nurse it) is a combination of <i>ve-heniki</i> (and nurse) and <i>oto</i> (it). I.E. points out that both <i>helikhi</i> and <i>heniki</i> are one and the same form, that is, <i>peh, yod, hifil</i> imperatives.</i> because the roots <i>yod, lamed, kaf</i> and <i>heh, lamed, kaf</i> are two roots with one meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>helikhi</i> (take) literally means go. I.E. maintains that there are two roots in Hebrew for the word go, <i>heh, lamed, kaf</i>, as in the word <i>halakhti</i>, and <i>yod</i>, <i>lamed, kaf</i>, as in the word <i>va-yelekh</i>. I.E. believes that the root of <i>helikhi</i> is <i>yod, lamed, kaf</i>, the <i>heh</i> being the <i>heh</i> of the <i>hifil</i> conjugation. See note 112.</i> For the <i>heh</i> is not one of the implied vowel letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>alef, vav</i>, and <i>yod</i> are implied in the vowels <i>kamatz, cholam</i>, and <i>tzere</i>; i.e., the words vocalized with these vowels are sounded as if followed by an <i>alef, vav</i>, or <i>yod</i>. Now when a letter is implied in a vowel it is occasionally omitted. If the <i>heh</i> was an implied letter then it is possible that the root of <i>helikhi</i> is <i>heh, lamed, kaf</i> with the <i>heh</i> implied. For the <i>heh</i> of <i>helikhi</i> is not a root letter. It is rather the <i>heh</i> of the <i>hifil</i> imperative.</i> Therefore the other <i>heh</i> is also like it.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the <i>heh</i> of the root (the other <i>heh</i>) should have appeared in the word <i>helikhi;</i> i.e., if <i>helikhi</i> came from the root <i>heh, lamed, kaf</i> the word should have been spelled <i>hehlikhi</i>.</i> Furthermore, the <i>alef</i> and likewise the <i>yod</i> and the <i>vav</i> are found in the middle of a word at times written and at times silent, that is, pronounced but unwritten,<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">See note 115.</i> but the <i>heh</i> is always visible when in the middle of a word. The words <i>be-latehem</i> (with their secret arts) (Ex. 7:22) and <i>be-lahatehem</i> (with their secret arts) (Ex. 7:11) are not, as I will explain,<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 7:22.</i> one and the same word.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">The first word is spelled without a <i>heh</i>, the second one with a <i>heh. Prima facie</i>, they are the same word with the missing <i>heh</i> implied. I.E. says no. He believes them to be two distinctive words with roots of their own.</i>
AND PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER SAID. Saadiah Gaon says that <i>helikhi</i> (take) is a composite of two words.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is not a <i>hifil</i> imperative from the root <i>yod, lamed, kaf</i> but rather a composite of the words <i>he</i> and <i>lekhi</i>.</i> However, the Gaon spoke incorrectly. It is, as I have noted, one word following the paradigm of <i>ve-henikehu</i> (and nurse it) in <i>and nurse it for me</i>. The word is in the <i>hifil</i>. The Gaon also said that <i>helikhi</i> is a composite of the words <i>he</i> and <i>lakh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>He</i> means here is. Compare, <i>he lakhem zera</i> (lo, here is seed for you) (Gen. 47:2). <i>Lakh</i> (<i>lekhi</i> in the feminine) means to you. <i>He lekhi</i> thus means here is to you; i.e., take it.</i> the meaning of <i>he</i> being the same as <i>he</i> (behold) in <i>Behold</i> (heh), <i>I will also bring thy way upon thy head</i> (Ezek. 16:43).<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. translates, <i>Lo, I will also bring</i>, etc.</i> However, we do not find the form <i>lekhi</i> used in Scripture when a female is being addressed. The form employed by Scripture is <i>lakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">If the word <i>helikhi</i> is a composite then it must be made up of the words <i>he</i> (here is) and <i>lekhi</i> (to you). However, the word for “to you” in the feminine is <i>lakh</i>, not <i>lekhi</i>.</i> <i>Helikhi</i> (take) is thus one word.
AND NURSED IT. <i>Va-tenikehu</i> comes from a root wherein the middle radical is dropped and the other two remain.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is an <i>ayin vav</i>. Its root is <i>nun, vav, kof</i>.</i> Observe, we have in our verse two roots with one meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">There are two words similar in meaning and from two different roots in verse 8. They are: <i>ve-henikehu</i> (and nurse it) from the root <i>yod, nun, kof</i>, and <i>va-tenikehu</i> (and nursed it) from the root <i>nun, vav, kof</i>.</i> It is the same case with the word <i>hetivi</i> (make good) in <i>make good melody</i> (Is. 23:16) which is an imperative following the paradigm of <i>helikhi</i> (take) and the word <i>hetivu</i> (they have well) in <i>they have well said all that they have spoken</i> (Deut. 15:25), which is like <i>hevi’u</i> (they brought) in <i>And they brought yet unto him</i> (Ex. 36:3), which is a word that drops its middle root letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hetivi</i> (make good) comes from the root <i>yod, tet, bet. Hetivu</i> (they have well) comes from the root <i>tet, vav, bet</i>.</i>

Verse 10

AND HE BECAME HER SON. This is similar to <i>And these are the sons of Michal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Michal had no children (II Sam. 6:23). However, her sister Merab’s children are listed in the Bible as her children because she raised them (See I.E.’s commentary on Gen. 36:2 and the notes thereto.) Similarly, Scripture considers Moses to be the son of the daughter of Pharaoh since she raised him. It should be noted that there is no verse that reads, “and these are the sons of Michal.” Scripture reads, <i>and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul</i> (II Sam. 21:8). I.E. quoted from memory. Cf. Weiser.</i> and to <i>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel</i> (Ezra 3:2; Haggai 1:1). Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah the brother of Shealtiel (II Chron. 3:17-19). He is called the son of Shealtiel because Shealtiel raised him.
[MOSES.] <i>Moshe</i> (Moses) is a Hebrew form of an Egyptian name. Moses was called <i>Monyos</i> in Egyptian. The name is so written in a book on agriculture which was translated from Egyptian into Arabic. This is also recorded in the books of the Greek scholars. Perhaps the daughter of Pharaoh learned our language, or she asked some one for its Hebrew version.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. was bothered as to how Pharaoh’s daughter was able to coin a Hebrew name for the child which commemorated the way in which he came to her. He answers that she either knew Hebrew or asked a Hebrew to coin a name which expressed her feelings.</i> Do not be perplexed as to why <i>moshe</i> was not called <i>mashuy</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mashuy</i> means drawn. Since Moses was drawn from the water, he should have been called <i>mashuy</i>, not <i>moshe</i>.</i> as nouns do not keep their forms as verbs do.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Verbs are conjugated according to paradigms. However, nouns do not always follow strict forms. See I.E.’s comment on Ex. 1:14 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 11

THAT HE WENT OUT UNTO HIS BRETHREN. The Egyptians,<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Moses considered the Egyptians his brethren because he was brought up as an Egyptian.</i> for he was in the king’s palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads, <i>that he went out</i>, because Moses went out of the palace (Krinsky). Or I.E. is explaining why Moses considered the Egyptians his brethren. He did so because he was brought up in the king’s palace.</i> <i>One of his brethren</i> means one of his family, as in <i>for we are brethren</i> (Gen. 13:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham said this to his nephew Lot. We thus see that the term “brethren” can refer to a member of one’s family.</i> Our clause is to be so understood because Scripture has already noted that the man was a Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>a Hebrew, one of his brethren</i>. If <i>one of his brethren</i> means a Hebrew then the Bible is being redundant. I.E. thus explains that <i>one of his brethren</i> means a member of his family.</i>

Verse 12



Verse 13

STRIVING. <i>Nitzim</i> (striving) is a <i>nifal</i> adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a <i>nifal</i> participle. I.E. refers to <i>nifal</i> participles as adjectives.</i> The complete form is <i>nintzim</i> (striving).<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>nitzim</i> is <i>nun, tzadi, heh</i>. In <i>nitzim</i> the <i>nun</i> of the root is missing because the <i>nun</i> in <i>nitzim</i> is the <i>nun</i> of the <i>nifal</i>. If the word were written with the <i>nun</i> of the root present, it would be written <i>nintzim</i>.</i> Compare, <i>nirim</i> (seen).<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>resh, alef, heh</i>.

TO HIM THAT DID WRONG. To him that acted violently.

Verse 14

SAYEST THOU TO KILL ME.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Rendered literally. J.P.S. translates this as <i>Thinkest thou to kill me</i>.</i> Sayest thou in thy heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">To kill me. That is, <i>sayest thou</i> (attah omer) means <i>thinkest thou</i>. The man was not accusing Moses of actually stating his intention of killing him.</i>
SURELY. <i>Akhen</i> (surely) means if so.

Verse 15

HEARD. The land of Midian was subservient to Pharaoh; hence Moses had to herd sheep and not live among people and be recognized.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was afraid that he would be identified and handed over to Pharaoh. therefore he chose an occupation which kept him away from populated areas.</i> It was at the time that his youngest son was born that God told Moses that Pharaoh and his servants from whom he had fled were dead. Upon hearing this Moses said, <i>and (God) delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh</i> (Ex. 18:4), as Moses feared Pharaoh as long as Pharaoh lived.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Moses named his youngest son Eliezer. He derived the name from the Hebrew words <i>El</i> (God) and <i>ezer</i> (help). Moses so named his son because, he said, <i>For the God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh</i> (Ex. 18:4). According to I.E., Moses gave this name to his son after learning that Pharaoh was dead and could no longer harm him.</i> After noting <i>and (Moses) dwelt in the land of Midian</i>, Scripture goes back and explains why Moses dwelt in Midian.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that Moses did not dwell in the land of Midian prior to being invited by Jethro to dwell with him after having saved his daughters from the shepherds. I.E. notes that here as in other places Scripture describes in a general way what happened and then goes into details.</i> Moses first sat down before the specified well.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The well noted in our verse. The text literally reads, <i>and he sat down by <span class="underline">the</span> well</i>. J.P.S. renders, <i>and he sat down by <span class="underline">a</span> well</i>.</i> It is like <i>And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went to Haran</i> (Gen. 28:10). After stating the aforementioned the Pentateuch backsteps and states, <i>And he lighted upon the place</i>, etc. (Gen. 28:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that Jacob alighted at Luz on the way to Haran. However, the previous verse reports that Jacob had arrived in Haran. I.E. explains that Scripture first tells us in a general way what happened. It then goes into details. See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 28:10 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 16

NOW THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN. The reference is to Jethro and not Reuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on verse 18.</i> The term <i>kohen</i> (priest) in Scripture refers to one who ministers either to the Lord or before an idol. <i>That they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office</i> (Ex. 28:41)<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads <i>ve-khihanu li</i>. If a <i>kohen</i> referred only to one who serves the Lord it would not be necessary to add the word <i>li</i> (unto me), as it would be understood that the reference is to priests of God. However, since one can also be a priest of idols the Bible adds the word <i>li</i>. The same is true with <i>the priest of the Lord</i>. If priests only referred to priests of the Lord there would be no reason for the Bible to add <i>of the Lord</i>.</i> and <i>the priests of the Lord</i> (Is. 61:6) are proof of this. Jethro, as I will explain, was a priest of the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. never returned to this point. Cf. Weiser. This seems to indicate that he never edited his works.</i>

Verse 17

AND THE SHEPHERDS CAME. The <i>mem</i> of <i>va-yegareshum</i> (and drove them away) has the same meaning as a <i>nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>them</i> in <i>and drove them away</i> refers to females, a <i>nun</i> should have been suffixed to <i>va-yegareshu</i> (and drove away) and the word read <i>va-yegareshun</i> rather than <i>va-yegareshum</i>. For the <i>mem</i> is a masculine suffix and the <i>nun</i> a feminine suffix. I.E. thus notes that although <i>va-yegareshum</i> is ordinarily masculine, here it is feminine.</i> If <i>va-yegareshum</i> was spelled with a <i>nun</i>, the <i>nun</i> might be confused with a superfluous <i>nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">At times an extra <i>nun</i> (or a superfluous <i>nun</i>) is added to the plural imperfect. Thus in place of the usual <i>yegareshu</i> (they will drive away) we have <i>yegareshun</i> (they will drive away). Now if our word was written <i>va-yegareshun</i> we would not know whether the word was merely plural with a superfluous <i>nun</i>, meaning: and they drove away, or if it was a plural with a feminine suffix, meaning: and they drove <span class="underline">them</span> away. To avoid this problem Scripture employed the masculine form here.</i> Similarly, the word <i>tzonam</i> (their flock) is spelled with a <i>mem</i> so as not to combine two <i>nuns</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>nun</i> is a feminine third person plural pronoun meaning their. Since our text speaks of flocks belonging to females we would expect to find <i>tzonan</i>, which has a feminine suffix, and not <i>tzonam</i>, which has a masculine suffix. I.E. explains that <i>tzonam</i> is used in place of <i>tzonan</i> because it is hard to pronounce two <i>nuns</i> in succession.</i>

Verse 18

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO REUEL THEIR FATHER. Reuel was their grandfather, while Jethro, who was also known as Hobab, was the father-in-law of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">According to our text Zipporah was the daughter of Reuel. However, Scripture always refers to Moses’ father-in-law by the name of Hobab or Jethro. Hence Zipporah must have been the daughter of Hobab/Jethro and not Reuel.</i> This is evidenced in these verses: <i>even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses</i> (Judges 4:11); <i>And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite</i> (Num. 10:29).

Verse 19

AND THEY SAID. They embellished what Moses had actually done.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16 tells us, <i>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water</i>. Thus it was the daughters of the priest of Midian and not Moses who drew the water. Moses helped them <i>and watered the flock</i> (v. 17); however, he did not draw water for them.</i> Or the water which they had drawn was insufficient for their flocks.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">And Moses drew additional water for them. Hence they did not embellish upon what Moses had actually done. Scripture either did not report the event or alluded to it in <i>and (Moses) watered the flock</i> (v. 17).</i>

Verse 20

AND HE SAID UNTO HIS DAUGHTERS. A grandfather is often called a father. Examples of the aforementioned are: <i>O God of my father Abraham</i> (Gen. 32:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Part of a prayer uttered by the patriarch Jacob. However, Jacob’s father was Isaac, not Abraham. We thus see that a grandfather is often called and considered as a father.</i> and <i>Nebuchadnezzar thy father</i> (Daniel 5:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel said this to Belshazzar who, according to I.E., was Nebuchadnezzar’s grandson.</i> Similarly, a grandson is called a son. Examples of the latter are: <i>The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children</i> (Gen. 31:43)<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Laban said this of Jacob’s children. However, in reality they were Laban’s grandchildren.</i> and <i>And thou his son, O Belshazzar</i> (Dan. 5:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">“His” refers to Nebuchadnezzar. The Bible thus refers to Nebuchadnezzar as the father of Belshazzar whereas in reality, according to I.E., he was Belshazzar’s grandfather.</i>
AND HE SAID. Behold, Scripture is being brief. It does not mention that they called Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Reuel told his daughters, <i>Call him, that he may eat bread</i>. The next verse opens, <i>And Moses was content to dwell with the man</i>. Scripture thus omits that Reuel’s daughters called Moses and invited him to eat bread.</i> for we may logically infer that they did so.
CALL HIM. <i>Kiren</i> (call) is irregular, as it does not follow its normal paradigm.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form for the feminine plural imperative of the root <i>kof, resh, heh</i> is <i>kirenah</i>. Thus <i>kiren</i> is irregular.</i>

Verse 21

AND MOSES WAS CONTENT. Perhaps Jethro the son of Reuel was then absent and is therefore not mentioned by Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Jethro is not mentioned in our incident.</i>

Verse 22

AND SHE BORE A SON, AND HE CALLED HIS NAME GERSHOM; FOR HE SAID. <i>He</i> refers to Moses. Zipporah is the Cushite woman of whom Scripture later speaks.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 12:1.</i> Do not believe what is written in the book called <i>The History of Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">A legendary history of Moses composed in the Middle Ages. Cf. Y.L. Zunz, <i>Ha-Derashot Be-Yisrael</i>, chap. 8. I.E. makes this point here because it is recorded in <i>The History of Moses</i> that Moses was a king in the land of Cush and that there he married a Cushite queen. The latter contradicts I.E.’s opinion that Zipporah and the Cushite are one and the same person.</i> I will give you a general rule: We should not rely on any book not written by prophets or by the sages who transcribed traditions passed on to them. We definitely should not rely on these books<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">That is, books not written by prophets or sages.</i> when they contradict reason.

See note 162, Zunz, <i>op. cit.</i>, chap. 8.</i> and similar compositions.

Verse 23

THAT THE KING OF EGYPT DIED. Moses was now able to return to Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">The Pharaoh who sought to slay Moses died. Moses was thus able to return to Egypt. See I.E.’s note on verse 15. Also see Ex. 4:19.</i> The Israelites repented. Ezekiel notes that the Israelites worshipped the idols of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 20:5-10.</i> It was because of this that the Lord afflicted them. As a punishment for not serving God they served cruel masters.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently interprets <i>and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage</i> as: Israel realized that they were being punished with bondage for worshipping idols.

Verse 24

AND GOD HEARD…[AND GOD REMEMBERED.] The meaning of <i>and God remembered</i> is that the time for their redemption had come.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">God, as it were, remembered that the time set aside for Israel’s enslavement was now over.

Verse 1

THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD, UNTO HOREB. This is the manner in which Moses recorded it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It was not yet known as <i>the mountain of God</i> since the Lord had not yet revealed Himself on it. However, when Moses wrote the Torah about 40 years later, it was so known. Hence we see that Moses used contemporary terminology when he wrote the Torah.</i> The place is called Horeb because of its great heat and lack of rainfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word comes from the root <i>chet, resh, bet</i>, which means dry.</i> As Moses noted,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 5:3.</i> it is located three days’ journey from Egypt. There is no moisture there and the dryness is overpowering because the Nile is far away.

Verse 2

APPEARED. Some interpret <i>be-labbat esh</i> to mean: in a flame of fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The word for flame is <i>lehavah</i> (compare Num. 21:28). Those who say that <i>be-labbat</i> means in a flame explain that <i>be-labbat</i> is short for <i>be-lahavat</i>.</i> However, it appears to me that its meaning is, in the heart<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in the midst of the fire. This explains why there is no <i>heh</i> in the word <i>labbat</i>.</i> of the fire, for we indeed find, <i>How weak is thy heart</i> (libbatekh) (Ezek. 16:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Libbatekh</i> is the word <i>libbah</i> (heart) plus the second person pronominal suffix.

It should be noted that the more familiar form for heart is <i>lev</i>.</i> However, Rabbi Adonim<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Adonim ben Tomim, a medieval grammarian.</i> says that if this were so, then <i>be-labbat</i> would have been vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> beneath the <i>lamed</i> like the word <i>ginnat</i> (garden of) in <i>I went down into the garden of nuts</i> (Canticles 6:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>labbat</i> is the construct form of <i>libbah</i> our text should read <i>libbat</i> not <i>labbat</i>, because <i>libbah</i> is vocalized like <i>ginnah</i> (garden), and the construct of <i>ginnah</i> is <i>ginnat</i>, not <i>gannat</i>.</i> Now, Rabbi Adonim seems to have forgotten the word <i>gannah</i> (garden)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The word for garden may be written <i>ginnah</i> or <i>gannah</i>. Similarly, the word for heart may be vocalized <i>libbah</i> or <i>labbah</i>. In the former the construct form is <i>libbat</i>, in the latter, <i>labbat</i>. The word in our verse follows the paradigm of <i>labbah</i>, hence the form <i>labbat</i>.</i> in <i>And as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth</i> (Is. 61:11).
THE BUSH. Saadiah Gaon says that <i>seneh</i> (bush) is a type of thorn bush. He further explains that the word <i>seneh</i> in <i>And the good will of Him that dwelt</i> (shokhni) <i>in the bush</i> (seneh) (Deut. 33:16) means heaven;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>seneh</i> has two meanings.

See I.E.’s introduction to the Pentateuch, Vol. I, p. 3, note 14.</i> on the other hand, says that the verse refers to the glory that dwelt in the bush.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Deut. 33:16 alludes to God who revealed Himself to Moses in the bush.</i> However, Rabbi Joshua spoke incorrectly, for how can God be called “Him that dwelleth in the bush” when he dwelt there for but a moment.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 33:16 literally reads: And the good will of Him that dwelleth in a bush. Now God revealed Himself only once in a bush.

Since God only revealed Himself once in the bush the perfect <i>shakhan</i> (dwelt) should have been used.</i> The word <i>oseh</i> (makes) in <i>Who makes</i> (oseh) <i>heaven and earth</i> (Ps. 121:2) is different,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. <i>Oseh</i> (makes) is a <i>po’el</i>, a present form.

Now if God is described as making heaven and earth, why can’t He be described as dwelling in the bush? I.E. answers that the two can’t be compared.</i> as God is constantly making and causing heaven and earth to exist in the same manner as speech issues from the mouth of man.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture praises God as the one <i>Who makes</i> (oseh) <i>heaven and earth</i>. Isaac Husik in <i>A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy</i>, J.P.S., Philadelphia, 1940, (p. 190) notes that I.E. “seems to favor the idea of eternal creation and maintenance of the universe, the relation of which to God is as the relation of speech to the speaker, which exists only so long as the speaker speaks. The moment he ceases speaking the sounds cease to exist.”</i> Additionally, after mentioning all the <i>precious things</i> (Deut. 33:13-16), Scripture concludes with <i>the good will of God</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 33:13-16 lists all the good things with which the land of Joseph was blessed, namely, the precious things of heaven, of the sun, of the everlasting hills, and of the earth. It concludes with <i>And the good will of Him that dwelt in a bush</i>. If <i>Him that dwelt in the bush</i> refers to God, why put the Lord’s blessings last (Krinsky)?</i> Moreover, what reason is there to mention this angel?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">God appeared to Moses in the bush via an angel.

However, in view of the fact that God appeared to Moses in a specific bush Scripture should have read: And the good will of Him who dwells in <span class="underline">the</span> bush (<i>shokhni <span class="underline">ba-seneh</span></i>) rather than: And the good will of Him that dwells in <span class="underline">a</span> bush (<i>shokni <span class="underline">seneh</span></i>).</i> and thereby would have referred to the well-known bush.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The bush in which God appeared to Moses, for God does not dwell in any bushes.</i>In my opinion <i>seneh</i> (bush) refers to only one thing,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Contra Saadiah Gaon, <i>seneh</i> does not mean a thorn bush or heaven. It has only one meaning.</i> namely, a type of dry thorn bush. This is the case in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Arabic word for thorn is <i>senna</i>.</i> Mount Sinai is so named because this type of bush grew there.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Mount Sinai takes its name from the <i>seneh</i> which grows there.</i> Similarly, its<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush</i>.</i> interpretation is: and the good will that he who lives in the place of the bush (<i>seneh</i>) seeks; that is, a person living in such a place entreats and prays that God do his will and wet the land that he lives in. He prays that God change it from a dry place, a place where the <i>seneh</i> grows, to an amply watered place so that it becomes like a wet and well-watered garden. Scripture states that an angel of the Lord appeared <i>out of the midst of <span class="underline">the</span> bush</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha-seneh</i> (<span class="underline">the</span> bush) implies a distinctive bush. Since there was as of yet nothing special about the bush, Scripture should have read <i>seneh</i> (a bush). It should be noted that J.P.S. translates <i>ha-seneh</i> as a bush. However, its literal translation is, the bush.</i> The word <i>seneh</i> has the definite article the (<i>heh</i>) prefixed to it because these are Moses’ very own words in writing the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">When Moses wrote the Torah he referred to the bush wherein the angel of God appeared to him. See note 1.</i>The word <i>bo’er</i> (burned) is a transitive verb. The phrase <i>a burning fire</i> is similar to <i>a devouring fire</i> (Deut. 4:24). <i>As the fire that burneth</i> (tivar) <i>the forest</i> (Ps. 83:15) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Here there is no doubt that the root <i>bet, ayin, resh</i> is transitive.</i> Now the fire that burned in the bush devoured all that was around it. Our verse is similar to <i>They have set Thy sanctuary on fire</i> (Ps. 74:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Our clause reads, <i>ha-seneh bo’er ba’esh</i> (the bush burned with fire). I.E. believes this should be explained as if written: <i>ba-seneh bo’er esh</i> (a fire burnt the bush). He proves that this is the meaning of the clause through Ps. 74:7, which reads: <i>shilchu va-esh mikdashekha</i>. The literal meaning is: they have set with fire thy sanctuary. According to I.E. this verse is to be read as if written: <i>shilchu esh be-mikdashekha</i> (they have set fire in thy sanctuary) (Filwarg).</i> <i>While the mountain did burn with fire</i> (Deut. 5:20) is also similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 5:20 reads, <i>va-ha-har bo’er ba-esh</i> (while the mountain burned with fire). Now mountains do not burn. Hence I.E. says that the verse should be interpreted as: the mountain consumed its environment with fire. I.E. explains thus because he believes <i>bo’er</i> to be a transitive verb.</i>
[WAS NOT CONSUMED.] The word <i>ukkal</i> (consumed) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. refers to participles as adjectives. <i>Ukkal</i> (consumed) appears to be a third person <i>pu’al</i> perfect. However, if this were the case it would be vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>, not a <i>kamatz</i>, and would have been preceded by <i>lo</i>, not by <i>enennu</i> (literally, is not).</i> It is similar to the <i>pa’ul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It is vocalized like a <i>pa’ul</i>. If it were <i>pa’ul</i> it would read <i>akhul</i>.</i> The words <i>lukkach</i> (taken), which is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> in <i>if thou see me when I am taken</i> (II Kings 2:10), <i>yullad</i> (shall be born) in <i>unto the child that shall be born</i> (Jud. 13:8), <i>yukashim</i> (snared) in <i>even so are the sons of man snared</i> (Eccles. 9:12) are similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">They are adjectives with <i>pu’al</i>-like vocalizations.</i> Now since these verbs are transitive, the word <i>mu’edet</i> (unsteady) in <i>and an unsteady leg</i> (Prov. 25:19) cannot be classified among these words<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie, mu’edet</i> also appears to be a <i>pu’al</i>-like adjective and should be classified as such, along with <i>ukkal, lukkach, yullad</i>, and <i>yukashim</i>.</i> as these words are transitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Intransitive words do not come in the <i>pu’al</i> form.</i> <i>Mu’edet</i> is similar to <i>mo’edet</i>, a <i>po’elet</i>, with the exception that a <i>shuruk</i> has been substituted for a <i>cholam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mu’edet</i> is a variation of <i>mo’edet</i>, which is a <i>po’elet</i>, the <i>kal</i> singular participle form that is vocalized <i>cholam, segol, segol</i>.</i>

Verse 3

AND MOSES SAID: I WILL TURN ASIDE (<i>ASURAH</i>) NOW. When a verb from the root <i>samekh, vav, resh</i> is followed by a <i>mem</i> it means: to distance from, as in <i>suru mi-menni</i> (turn aside from me) (Ps. 6:9) in which the speaker says, distance yourself from me. However, if the word <i>el</i> (to) which is vocalized with a <i>segol</i> follows it, then it has the opposite meaning, as in <i>suru elai</i> (turn in) (Jud. 4:18), the meaning of which is, turn from your place and come to me. Moses wanted to turn aside from where he was and to then draw near to the bush.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The text reads, <i>asurah na</i> (I will turn aside now). I.E. believes that this is short for <i>asurah na mi-mikomi</i> (I will turn aside now from my place). We should thus interpret <i>asurah</i> as if it were followed by a <i>mem;</i> i.e., it means: I will turn aside from my place.</i>
AND SEE THIS GREAT SIGHT. This is the first sign recorded in the Torah that the Lord did via his prophet Moses. Scripture thus says, <i>and this shall be the token</i> (sign) <i>unto thee that I have sent thee</i> (v. 12).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets in this way: And this burning bush shall be the token that I have sent thee.

A very similar explanation is given in Midrash Rabbah (Ex. 2:10). The Midrash asks, “Why did God show Moses this vision (i.e., the burning bush)?” The Midrash answers, “God showed Moses a burning fire which did not consume…(for) just as the bush was aflame with fire but was not consumed neither shall the Egyptians be able to consume Israel.” It is difficult to understand why I.E. quoted a Karaite when the same interpretation is found in the Midrash.</i> is compared to fire and Israel to a bush. Hence the bush was not burnt.

Verse 4

AND WHEN THE LORD SAW. These words were also written later by Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on verses 1 and 2. At this point Moses did not yet know that God was about to reveal Himself to him. However, Moses later related what had happened earlier.</i> The angel was called by God’s revered name in the sense of, <i>for My name is in him</i> (Ex. 23:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads, <i>And when the Lord</i> (YHVH) <i>saw</i>. According to I.E. it was not actually the Lord but the angel of the Lord mentioned in verse 2. The angel is referred to by the Tetragrammaton because the Lord’s name is in him. See I.E. on Ex. 23:21.</i> I will explain this when I comment on the latter verse. We find the same with the angel that appeared to Gideon. There it is written, <i>And the Lord said unto him</i> (Jud. 6:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Here too an angel spoke to Gideon. Nevertheless, the angel is referred to by the name <i>YHVH</i> (the Lord).</i> Or its meaning is that the Lord saw that Moses turned aside to see the great sight and He commanded an angel to call Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The text reads, <i>And when the Lord</i> (YHVH) <i>saw that he turned aside to see, God</i> (elohim) <i>called unto him</i>. According to I.E.’s first interpretation the reference in this verse is to an angel. He now offers a different interpretation. He now suggests that Lord refers to the Deity and <i>elohim</i> (God) to an angel.</i> Hence the use of the term <i>elohim</i> (God) in our verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord told <i>elohim</i>, i.e., an angel to call unto Moses.

He explains the verse to mean: except the angels, who do not dwell in any body.</i> Thus <i>elohim</i> refers to the above-noted angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 2 reads, <i>And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him</i>. Verse 4 states, <i>God</i> (elohim) <i>called unto him</i>. I.E. explains that <i>elohim</i> refers to the angel of the Lord, as an angel is termed <i>elohin</i> (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 5

AND HE SAID: DRAW NOT NIGH HITHER. Its meaning is, stand in your place and draw not nigh to the bush where the fire is.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>al tikrav halom</i> (draw not nigh hither). I.E. explains that the word <i>halom</i> means hither.</i> <i>Is there yet a man come hither?</i> (I Sam. 10:22) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>ha-va od halom ish</i> (is there yet a man come hither). Here too <i>halom</i> means hither.</i> A <i>nun</i> is missing in the word <i>shal</i> (put off), as it is in the word <i>ga</i> (touch),<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>shal</i> is <i>nun, shin, lamed</i>. In the <i>kal</i> imperative the <i>nun</i> is dropped. Similarly in the word <i>ga</i>, which comes from the root <i>nun, gimel, ayin</i>.</i> for the word <i>shal</i> comes from the same root as <i>ve-nashal</i> (and shall cast out) in <i>and shall cast out many nations</i> (Deut. 7:1).

Verse 6

MOREOVER HE SAID: I AM THE LORD OF THY FATHER. After stating, <i>I am the God of thy father</i>, He explains that the reference is to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He starts with Abraham because Abraham was the first to call upon the name of the Lord and he built an altar to the Lord,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. 12:8, <i>and he</i> (Abraham) <i>builded there an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord</i>.</i> for his father and his brother worshipped idols.

What he probably means is <i>ve-sha’ar ha-ayin <span class="underline">karov</span></i> (similar to) <i>le-sha’ar ha-shamayim. Shamayim</i> (heaven) represents the angels. I.E seems to be saying that the gift of sight is divine, for unlike touch, taste, or hearing it can perceive distant things (Filwarg).</i> for it can see in one moment images that are both far and near. However, this is not the case with the senses of the ears, nose, palate, and hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Moses hid only his eyes.

Verse 7

AND THE LORD SAID. The messenger speaks the same language as the one who sent him.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse records the words of an angel. The angel spoke on behalf of God. Hence it appears as if God Himself was speaking.</i>
[I HAVE SURELY SEEN.] Its meaning is: I have seen that which people do not see, namely, the violence that is done to them secretly.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>ra’o ra’iti</i> (I have surely seen). The repetition of the verb <i>ra’ah</i> implies: I have seen what others have not.</i>
AND HAVE HEARD THEIR CRY. I have heard their cry which is heard by all and I know the pain which they bear in their hearts.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their pains</i>. I.E. explains that any bystander would hear the cry of a slave in pain. However, only God would know what is in his or her heart. I.E. thus notes that God heard what all hear and knew what others did not know.</i>

Verse 8

AND I AM COME DOWN. Scripture says this because the heavens are more glorious than the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And I am come down</i> implies that God is only in heaven. I.E. says that Scripture employs this terminology only because the heavens are more glorious than the earth since God is all over.</i> God’s glory fills everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">God’s glory fills both heaven and earth.</i> It is only because the decrees come down from heaven that Scripture employs the term <i>And I am come down</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">An apparently different interpretation of <i>And I am come down</i>. I.E. first proposed that it is used out of respect for God. He now suggests that it refers to God’s decrees.</i> Furthermore, the angel was a higher form<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Angels are superior to prophets.

[MOREOVER I HAVE SEEN THE OPPRESSION.] Its meaning is: Moreover I have seen the oppression with which they in their pride oppress them. Jethro similarly said, <i>for that they dealt proudly against them</i> (Ex. 18:11).

AND HE SAID: CERTAINLY I WILL BE WITH THEE.

The reason they are being brought out of Egypt is that they should serve Me on this mountain where I have shown you this great wonder.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. our verse contains two elements: an allusion to the burning bush (the token) and a promise that Israel will serve God on the mountain upon which God first appeared to Moses.</i> It is thus written, (<i>I am the Lord</i>)<i>…that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God</i> (Lev. 22:23). Moses similarly said to Pharaoh, <i>We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God</i> (Ex. 8:23)<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Since God had promised that Israel would serve Him on Sinai.

Verse 13

AND MOSES SAID. Moses now asked which of God’s names he should relate to Israel, for with the name of <i>El Shaddai</i> (God Almighty) he could not perform signs.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">The name by which God appeared to the patriarchs.

However, God actually used the name <i>El Shaddai</i> (God Almighty) when he revealed Himself to the patriarchs.</i> However, Rabbi Joshua is mistaken. In the Torah portion <i>Bereshit</i> at the beginning of the Pentateuch we find that Scripture does not employ the Tetragrammaton but uses the name <i>Elohim</i> (God) until the verse which concludes with the words <i>in creating had made</i> (Gen. 2:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">From Gen. 1, 2:3 the Bible refers to the Deity as <i>Elohim</i> (God). If Moses had employed the name that he knew in writing Genesis, he would have used the Tetragrammaton in Gen. 1, 2:3 as well. Hence we may deduce that Moses was very exact with regard to the names of God when he wrote the Torah and employed the names of the Lord that were applicable to the time or event concerning which he wrote.</i> After the latter verse Scripture refers to God by the name <i>Adonai Elohim</i> (Lord God). After the birth of Cain, Scripture employs the term <i>Adonai</i> (Lord) for the Deity only by itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">It does not refer to God as <i>Adonai Elohim</i>.</i> We never find Moses using the name <i>Elohim</i> for God.

Verse 14

Another name meaning the same as the first one.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YHVH</i> (the Tetragrammaton read as if written <i>Adonai</i>) and <i>EHYH</i> (I am) have the same basic meaning.

It is prohibited to sound out its true consonants.</i> 
The words of Abraham the author: Behold, I now begin to elaborate because I need a firm foundation. Note that a proper name serves as a token and as a sign of the one being referred to by those who enunciate it and those who hear it.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a proper name indicates a specific person.</i> A proper name is distinguished from an adjective<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. also refers to common nouns as adjectives.</i> in four ways. The first is that an adjective is derived from an imperative, such as <i>chakham</i> (be wise)<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized with a <i>chataf pattach</i> beneath the <i>chet</i>.</i> in <i>My son, be wise</i> (Prov. 27:11), or a perfect, as in <i>My son, if your heart gets wisdom</i> (chakham)<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>chet</i>.</i> (Prov. 23:15), or an imperfect, as in <i>That thou mayest be wise</i> (techkam) <i>in thy latter end</i> (Prov. 19:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that an adjective is derived from a verb. Thus the adjective <i>chakham</i> (wise, intelligent) is derived from a verb meaning to become wise.</i> However, this is not the case with a proper noun such as Abraham, as no perfect or imperfect form can be derived from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">A proper noun cannot be conjugated because it has no verbal form.</i> Now even though there are proper nouns that are derived from verbs, such as the name <i>yitzchak</i> (Isaac),<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>tzadi, chet, kof</i>, meaning laughed.</i> we do not say <i>yitzchakti</i> (I was Isaaced) or <i>itzchak</i> (I will be Isaaced).<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that although the root of Isaac can be conjugated, the proper name itself cannot be conjugated.</i> A proper name is not used as an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">One does not say, he is an Isaac, or he was Abrahamed.</i> The second difference is that an adjective comes in the plural. For example, <i>chakham</i> (wise) becomes <i>chakhamim</i> (wise). However, we do not have a plural form for the proper name <i>avraham</i> (Abraham). Thus we do not say <i>avrahamim</i> (Abrahams). Neither is there a plural for the proper name <i>yisra’el</i> (Israel). Thus if there are two people named Israel in a place we do not say <i>yisra’elim</i> (Israels). We would only use the term <i>yisra’elim</i> if we wanted to relate each of them to the people of Israel, as the term Israel is the name of a group.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Israel (<i>yisra’el</i>) is both the name of a person and the name of a nation. If we want to say that an individual is an Israelite we use the term <i>yisra’eli</i>. If we want to say that two or more people are Israelites we use the term <i>yisra’elim</i> (Israelites). However, if there are two people named Israel in a place, we do not say there are two Israels there (which is proper in English), because the name of individuals does not come in the plural.</i> The third difference is that a definite article is not prefixed to a proper noun as it is to an adjective. From the word <i>chakham</i> (wise) we get <i>he-chakham</i> (the wise man) (Eccles. 2:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the word <i>chakham</i> can be written with the definite article (<i>he-chakham</i>).</i> However, it is incorrect to say <i>ha-avraham</i> (the Abraham) or <i>ha-yitzchak</i> (the Isaac). The word <i>ha-kohelet</i> (Eccles. 12:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie, kohelet</i> is a proper name. Nevertheless, it has a definite article attached to it.</i> cannot be used as an argument against the aforementioned because the term <i>kohelet</i> is not a proper name but an adjective describing the wisdom which was accumulated.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">By Solomon. The root of <i>kohelet</i> is <i>kof, heh, lamed</i>, meaning to gather.</i> Similarly, the word <i>va-ha-adam</i> (Gen. 2:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Adam was the name of the first man. Yet this proper noun has a definite article before it (<i>ha-adam</i>).</i> is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is not a personal name.</i> It has a secret meaning to it, as it is the name of a genus.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to all of mankind. See I.E. on Gen. 2:8 and the notes thereto.</i> The name <i>ha-menasheh</i> (Deut. 3:13)<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menashah</i> (Manasseh) is a proper noun. Yet it has the definite article prefixed to it.</i> has a definite article before it because it refers to genealogy.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to the tribe of Manasseh. Hence Manasseh in this verse is a common rather than a proper noun.</i> The fourth difference is that a proper noun has no construct form whereas an adjective does. For example, we find, <i>chakham lev</i> (wise of heart) (Job 9:4). However, it would be incorrect to say <i>yitzchak ha-dor</i> (Isaac of the generation), because a proper name stands by itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">It does not have a construct form.</i> The same is the case with the name <i>Eheyeh</i> (I am) and also with the glorious name of God, the Tetragrammaton, because both of these names are proper names.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they do not come in the construct.</i> Now, we do find, <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> (the Lord of hosts) (Is. 1:9),<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Wherein <i>Adonai</i> is apparently in the construct.</i> and as a result many were forced to conclude that <i>tzeva’ot</i> is a proper name<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a proper name of God. According to this interpretation Scripture here uses two personal names of God back to back as it does in Is. 12:2, in which we find <i>Yah Adonai</i>. Hence <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> should be rendered, Lord Hosts, not Lord of hosts, for <i>Adonai</i> is not in the construct with <i>tzeva’ot</i>.</i> or that the Lord is outstanding among<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a token or sign in His host. Cf. <i>Haggigah</i> 16a.</i> His host.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> means: Lord among His hosts. The Talmud thus interpreted <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> as <i>Adonai be-tzeva’ot</i>. The Talmud did so because <i>Adonai</i> cannot come in the construct.</i> However, this is incorrect, because Scripture reads, <i>Elohe ha-tzeva’ot</i> (the God of Hosts) (Amos 3:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Here <i>tzeva’ot</i> has a definite article prefixed to it. Hence it cannot be a personal name. For the same reason, <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> cannot be interpreted to mean the Lord is outstanding among His hosts.</i> <i>Tzeva’ot</i> is never encountered by itself. It is always connected either to the word <i>Elohim</i> (God) or to God’s glorious name, <i>Adonai</i> (<i>Elohim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The text has <i>Adonai Elohim</i>. However, this appears to be a scribal error, for I.E. goes on to say, “Do not be bothered by the phrase <i>Adonai Elohim tzeva’ot</i>.” Why should the latter present any problem to I.E.’s assertion that the name <i>tzeva’ot</i> is only found connected to <i>Adonai</i> or <i>Adonai Elohim</i> when in this case it is connected to <i>Adonai Elohim</i>? Furthermore, I.E. limits the use of the term “the glorious name of God” to <i>Adonai</i>. He does not use it in reference to <i>Adonai Elohim</i>. Hence we should read, “or to God’s glorious name, <i>Adonai</i>,” and omit the word <i>Elohim</i> (Krinsky).</i> Do not be bothered by the phrase <i>Adonai Elohim tzeva’ot</i> (O Lord God of hosts) (Ps. 59:6),<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Where <i>tzeva’ot</i> is connected to <i>Adonai Elohim</i> (Krinsky) or where <i>tzeva’ot</i> seems to be a personal name, for the verse appears to read, “0 Lord God, Hosts.”</i> as its meaning is similar to <i>ve-ha-nevu’ah oded ha-navi</i> (even the prophecy of Oded the prophet) (II Chron. 15:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">For grammatical reasons this verse has to be read as if written: <i>ve-hanevu’ah nevu’at oded ha-navi</i>. That is, the word <i>nevu’at</i> is implied in the word <i>ve-hanevu’ah</i>. See I.E. on Gen. 2:9. Similarly, in our phrase the word <i>Elohe</i> is implied in the word <i>Elohim</i>. Our phrase is thus to be read: <i>Adonai Elohim Elohe ha-tzeva’ot</i>.</i> 
Now the Lord’s personal name is sometimes used in an adjectival sense because God alone exists forever and the existence of all things is contingent upon Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. will soon note that when the name Lord is used as an adjective it means the maintainer of the universe.</i> God’s proper name is used here in the same way that the name <i>moshe</i> (Moses) is used in <i>Then He remembered the days of old, when He drew</i> (moshe) <i>His people</i> (Is. 63:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s rendering of this verse (Krinsky). Here the name <i>moshe</i> is used as a verb or an adjective. I.E. refers to verbs in the present as adjectives. Similarly, the name <i>Adonai</i> is used as an adjective.</i> The meaning of <i>Adonai</i> when used as an adjective is: the maintainer of existence. Hence in the phrase <i>Adonai Elohim</i> the holy angels are connected to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elohim</i> means the angels (see I.E. on Gen 1:1). In the phrase <i>Adonai Elohim, Adonai</i> is in the construct with <i>Elohim</i>. Thus the meaning of the phrase is: Lord of the angels. Here <i>Adonai</i> is an “adjective,” as it is in the construct. According to I.E., <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> means: the One who maintains the world via the agency of the angels.</i> Similarly, in the phrase <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> (Lord of hosts) <i>tzeva’ot</i> refers to the hosts of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">The angels.</i> Pay no attention to Saadiah Gaon who says that God is called <i>Adonai tzeva’ot</i> because of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah Gaon <i>tzeva’ot</i> refers to Israel. Hence Lord of hosts means Lord of Israel. I.E. disagrees.

However, look at <i>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him</i> (I Kings 22:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies that God is called Lord of hosts because the hosts of heaven are His servants.</i> Now the name <i>Elohim</i> is an adjective, because it comes in both the plural and the singular.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. noted above that a proper name has no plural form. Since the name <i>Elohim</i> comes both in the singular and the plural it cannot be a proper name.</i> Compare, <i>Is not God</i> (Elo’a) <i>in the height of heaven</i> (Job 22:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elo’a</i> is the singular of <i>Elohim</i>.</i> Furthermore, the word <i>Elohim</i> comes in the construct.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Another point proving that <i>Elohim</i> cannot be a proper name.</i> Compare, <i>Elohim Elohe yisra’el</i> (God, the God of Israel) (Ps. 72:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elohe</i> (God of) is the construct form of <i>Elohim</i>.</i> The word <i>El</i> (God) means mighty.

Note that the number one is the secret and the foundation of all numbers,<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. now goes on to give a mystical explanation of God’s name based on numerology. God’s personal name is written <i>YHVH</i> (<i>yod, heh, vav, heh</i>) or <i>EHYH</i> (<i>alef, heh, yod, heh</i>). Thus God’s name is written with the letters <i>alef</i> (numerically equal to 1), <i>heh</i> (5), <i>vav</i> (6), and <i>yod</i> (10).</i> and that two is the first of the even numbers and three the first of the odd numbers. Now from one point of view there are only nine numbers.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">1 through 9. For the number 10 is like the number 1.

The highest of all is the throne of glory, which also comprises all of the spheres and actuates them.

We thus see the following: below 5 the cube of a number is less than the sum of that number squared plus the square of its double.

Now there are four gutturals.

Thus the gentiles cannot sound them.<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Christians.

The medieval grammarians refer to letters which serve as prefixes, suffixes, and prepositions as <i>me’sharitim</i>, ministering letters.</i> Ministering letters were also chosen from among the palatals, i.e., <i>gimel, yod, kaf, kof</i>, as the palate is next to the throat. The <i>yod</i> and <i>kaf</i> were chosen from the palatals to serve as ministering letters because they are the easiest palatals to pronounce. The <i>gimel</i> and <i>kof</i> are therefore only used as root letters. 
The letters <i>dalet, tet, lamed, nun</i>, and <i>tav</i> are linguals. Two letters, the <i>dalet</i> and the <i>tet</i>, were chosen from the linguals to serve only as root letters. The others serve both as root letters and as ministering letters. The letters <i>zayin, samekh, shin, resh</i>, and <i>tzadi</i> are dentals. They are all hard to pronounce.<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, with the exception of the <i>shin</i>, they serve only as root letters.</i> The <i>shin</i> is the easiest of the dentals to sound. Hence it was chosen as a ministering letter while the others were left to serve only as root letters.

It is only right that the alphabet begin with a guttural, because the throat is the first organ in the framework of the human body to produce a sound.<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">The head is on top of the body. The throat, the top of which is connected to the head, is the first organ to produce speech.

It is fitting that the <i>heh</i> be the fifth number equivalent to the glorious number five.<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i>, the second most easily pronounced guttural, was chosen to represent the fifth letter of the alphabet, which serves as the number 5. This is so, as I.E. has previously explained, because the number 5 is a glorious number. A guttural was chosen to represent this number because the guttural was made by the “first” organ in the body.</i> These two letters are the easiest to enunciate. Now since the first letter of the alphabet is a guttural the second letter in the alphabet was chosen from among the five labials, which are produced by the last of the body’s five organs of speech.<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">The order of the organs producing speech are: throat, palate, tongue, teeth, and lips.

A palatal, the <i>gimel</i>, was chosen as the third letter and a lingual, the <i>dalet</i>, as the fourth letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">The palate is the second organ of speech, the tongue the third, and the teeth the fourth. The master of the Hebrew language decided to follow the order of the organs of the body in choosing the first, third, fourth, and sixth letters.

The Hebrew grammarian now had to use the fourth of the implied letters<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>yod</i>. The implied letters are <i>alef, heh, vav</i>, and <i>yod</i>.</i> for the tenth letter, which is equivalent to the number ten.

He had similarly used the <i>vav</i>, which happens to be a very important and easily sounded labial. Now there are no root letters more easily pronounceable than the palatals.

If the moon had its own light, its light would be seen.</i> and if it faces the sun in one of the above-noted places at night<sup class="footnote-marker">360</sup><i class="footnote">A lunar eclipse.</i> the moon is invisible.<sup class="footnote-marker">361</sup><i class="footnote">If the moon had its own light, it would not be eclipsed when the earth comes between it and the sun.</i> 
Now the stars that make up the sphere of the constellations are a level above the “ministers.”<sup class="footnote-marker">362</sup><i class="footnote">See note 337.</i> They are fixed in one sphere and they do not move as the ministers do. Their distances and relationship to each other do not change. They have one motion; it neither increases nor decreases. Their relationship to the earth is always the same. They appear different according to the place on earth where they are seen and the movement of the sun. The highest world is the world of the holy angels who are incorporeal and, unlike the souls of men, do not inhabit bodies. Their importance is far and above the understanding of their insignificant counterparts.<sup class="footnote-marker">363</sup><i class="footnote">Human beings. The latter are counterparts to the angels, as man is created in their image. See I.E. on Gen. 1:26.</i> This entire world is glorious and unchanging. There is no change in its arrangement. This world is not self-sufficient<sup class="footnote-marker">364</sup><i class="footnote">As great as this world is, it is not independent of God.</i> but its existence is dependent upon God the glorious. Man’s soul is of this same kind.<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">As the inhabitants of this world, the angels.</i> It receives power from above in accordance to the arrangement of the ministers, that is, the arrangement of each “minister” vis-à-vis the great hosts at the time of a person’s birth. If the soul grows wise it will share the secrets of the angels and will be able to receive great power from an upper power that received it from the light of the angels. The person will then cleave to God the glorious. This is precisely what Jacob meant when he vowed, <i>then shall the Lord be my God</i> (Gen. 28:21). Jacob vowed that he would dedicate his entire life to cleave unto God to the fullest of his might. Jacob therefore said, <i>Put away the strange gods that are among you</i> (Gen. 35:2). Jacob did not utter these words till this point, for it was only now that he was going to serve God according to his vow. So too, Jethro, who said, <i>Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods</i>. (Ex. 18:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">366</sup><i class="footnote">Hence when he said, <i>Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods</i>, what he meant was that he was now going to cleave only to God.</i> Jethro was a very wise man.<sup class="footnote-marker">367</sup><i class="footnote">Jethro advised Moses on the question of judges (Ex. 18:17).</i> Proof of the latter is, <i>And they asked each other of their welfare</i> (Ex. 18:7). Additionally, Scripture states, <i>and bowed down</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>), which implies that Jethro did not stand in awe of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">368</sup><i class="footnote">Jethro is called Moses’ colleague, as is implied in the word <i>le-re’ehu</i> in Ex. 18:7. Furthermore, Moses bowed in front of Jethro (<i>Ibid.</i>).</i> 
When Adam realized that he would die he sired a son so that the human kind would be preserved.<sup class="footnote-marker">369</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 4:1.</i> He received the power to preserve the human genus.<sup class="footnote-marker">370</sup><i class="footnote">The power to preserve the kind. However, the individual would die.</i> Hence Eve<sup class="footnote-marker">371</sup><i class="footnote">Who concurred with Adam.</i> exclaimed, <i>I have gotten a man with the help of God</i><sup class="footnote-marker">372</sup><i class="footnote">The power to preserve the human race came from God.</i> (Gen. 4:1). Each one of the sons of the prophets<sup class="footnote-marker">373</sup><i class="footnote">Students of the prophets (<i>bene ha-nevi’im</i>) mentioned in the prophets.</i> used to isolate himself in the hope of being inspired from on high according to his ability. Now it is via this name<sup class="footnote-marker">374</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YHVH</i>.</i> that new signs and wonders come into this world. When this name was told to Pharaoh<sup class="footnote-marker">375</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to him.</i> he asked for signs and wonders.<sup class="footnote-marker">376</sup><i class="footnote">When Moses told Pharaoh that <i>YHVH</i> sent him, Pharaoh asked for a sign to see if this power could change nature.</i> Therefore this name is not found in the book of Koheleth, as this book speaks of things concerning which nothing can be added nor anything taken away (Eccles. 3:4). It deals with those things concerning which <i>there is nothing new under the sun</i> (Eccles. 1:9). It deals with those things which are based on the wisdom that comes from on high.<sup class="footnote-marker">377</sup><i class="footnote">The book of Ecclesiastes deals with natural law. However, the name <i>YHVH</i> changes natural law. Hence it would be misplaced in Ecclesiastes.</i>

Verse 16

GO, AND GATHER. Scripture reads, <i>the God of Abraham</i><sup class="footnote-marker">378</sup><i class="footnote">The name God is not repeated in our verse with Isaac or with Jacob.</i> because God made a covenant with Abraham to give him the land of Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">Canaan was first promised to Abraham (Gen. 15:18). God then promised Isaac and Jacob that he would keep the promise made to Abraham (Gen. 26:3-5; 35:11, 12) (Weiser).</i>
[I HAVE SURELY REMEMBERED YOU.] The meaning of <i>pakod</i> (remembered) is that the time of their visitation had come.<sup class="footnote-marker">380</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>peh, kof, dalet</i> means to visit (cf. Ex. 20:5). Hence I.E.’s comment that <i>pakod pakadti</i> (I have surely remembered) means that the time that I should visit you (and keep my promise) has come. See Gen. 21:1 and the use of the word <i>pakad</i> therein.</i>

Verse 17

AND I HAVE SAID. I have previously said to your fathers that <i>I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt</i>, the reference being to <i>and afterward shall they come out with great substance</i> (Gen. 15:14), and to <i>and I will also surely bring thee up again</i> (Gen. 46:4). Or its meaning is, I have now decreed<sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-omar</i>, usually translated as and I have said, here means: and I have decreed.</i> that this<sup class="footnote-marker">382</sup><i class="footnote">What follows, in the verse.</i> shall come to pass, as in <i>Thou shalt also decree a thing</i> (Job 22:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">383</sup><i class="footnote">Job 22:28 reads, <i>ve-tigzar omer</i>. What it means is: <i>ve-tigzar ge-zerah</i>. We thus see that the root <i>alef, mem, resh</i> sometimes means to decree. Hence <i>va-omar</i> may be rendered: and I have decreed, rather than, and I have said.</i>

Verse 18

AND THEY SHALL HEARKEN. When the word <i>shama</i> (heard) is followed by a <i>lamed</i> or <i>bet</i> its meaning is not to hear a voice but rather to hear the message which a voice carries. The <i>yod</i> in the word <i>ha-ivriyyim</i> (the Hebrews) has a <i>dagesh</i> for euphonic purposes. It is there to emphasize the <i>yod</i> genitive. The <i>yod</i> in <i>ha-ivrim</i> (the Hebrews) that follows the <i>resh</i> with a <i>chirik</i> beneath it is, in accordance with Hebrew grammar, the sign of the plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">384</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chirik yod mem</i> is the sign of the plural (<i>ivrim, yeladim</i>, etc.). <i>Chirik yod</i> indicates membership in a group (compare, <i>ivri, yehudi, yisra’eli</i>). Now when the two <i>yods</i> come together the gentilic <i>yod</i> is usually dropped. In our verse not only do we have two <i>yods</i>, but one of them receives a <i>dagesh</i> (thus doubling it). The extra <i>yod</i> and the <i>dagesh</i> are in our word for euphonic purposes, i.e., to emphasize the gentilic <i>yod</i> (Filwarg).</i>
HATH MET WITH US. <i>Nikrah</i> (hath met) means the same whether spelled with a <i>heh</i> or an <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">385</sup><i class="footnote">Here the word is spelled with a <i>heh</i>. In Ex. 5:3 it is spelled with an <i>alef</i>.</i> Compare, <i>nikro nikreti</i><sup class="footnote-marker">386</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nikro</i> is spelled with an <i>alef. Nikreti</i> comes from the root <i>kof, resh, heh</i>, for the <i>yod</i> takes the place of the <i>heh</i> in a first person perfect. Compare, <i>nikrah</i> in our verse.</i> (as I happened by chance) (II Sam. 1:6). I will now explain the meaning of <i>nikrah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">387</sup><i class="footnote">In Ex. 5:3 I.E. explains that <i>nikrah</i> (met) means the same as <i>pagah</i> (fall upon).</i> Its meaning is, <i>lest he fall upon us</i> (Ex. 5:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">388</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>nikrah</i> means fall upon, as in <i>lest he fall upon us</i> (Netter).</i>

Verse 19

AND I KNOW THAT THE KING OF EGYPT WILL NOT GIVE YOU. Leave.<sup class="footnote-marker">389</sup><i class="footnote">The word leave or permission must be added to the text. Our verse literally reads: And I know that the king of Egypt will not give (<i>yitten</i>) you to go.</i> Or the meaning of <i>yitten</i> (give you) is, let, as in <i>Therefore suffered I thee not</i> (netatikha) <i>to touch her</i> (Gen. 20:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">In this case nothing is missing from the text. Our verse reads: And I know that the king of Egypt will not let (<i>yitten</i>) you go.</i>
[EXCEPT BY A MIGHTY HAND.]<sup class="footnote-marker">391</sup><i class="footnote">The text literally reads: and not by a mighty hand. Hence the two explanations which follow.</i> Neither will he let you go because of his mighty hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">392</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh’s hand is mighty and he therefore sees no reason to let you go.</i> However, Saadiah explains it to mean: neither will he let you go if he is struck once with a mighty hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">393</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it will take more than one plague to get Pharaoh to change his mind.</i>

Verse 20

AND I WILL PUT FORTH MY HAND. Against his<sup class="footnote-marker">394</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh’s.</i> hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">395</sup><i class="footnote">God will show Pharaoh that His hand is mightier than Pharaoh’s hand.</i>

Verse 21

AND I WILL GIVE. The Egyptians’ appeasing of the Israelites by imploring them to ask for jewels and raiments (which is the meaning of <i>va-yashilum</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">396</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>va-yashilum</i> (so that they let them have what they asked) is found in Ex. 12:36. I.E. renders <i>va-yashilum:</i> they implored them to ask.</i> was also a great wonder.<sup class="footnote-marker">397</sup><i class="footnote">Not only the plagues were wondrous. This too was a wonder.</i> This is the opposite of the behavior of the world’s inhabitants.<sup class="footnote-marker">398</sup><i class="footnote">People don’t go around imploring others to ask them for things.</i>
[EMPTY.] The <i>mem</i> of <i>rekam</i> (empty) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">399</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>resh, yod, kof</i>. The <i>mem</i> has no meaning and apparently serves no purpose.</i> The word <i>rekam</i> is used in the plural as in our verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">400</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>lo telekhu rekam</i> (ye shall not go empty). <i>Telekhu</i> is a masculine plural. Hence <i>rekam</i> too must be a masculine plural. I.E.’s point is that the Bible employs the term <i>rekam</i> with the masculine feminine and the plural. See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 31:42 and the notes thereto.</i> It is also used as a feminine in <i>Go not empty</i><sup class="footnote-marker">401</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tavo’i</i> (go) is a feminine singular. Hence <i>rekam</i> (empty) too must be a feminine singular. Cf. I.E. on Gen. 31:42 and the notes thereto.</i> (Ruth 3:17). The word <i>chinnam</i> is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">402</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 31:42 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 22

BUT EVERY WOMEN SHALL ASK. Now elsewhere it is written with regard to both males and females, <i>and let them ask</i> (Ex. 11:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">403</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that both males and females did the asking. The question thus arises: Why did Scripture state here that <i>every woman shall ask</i>?</i> Scripture mentions females here because women are more in the habit of asking their neighbors for jewelry of gold and silver to put on the necks of their sons and daughters. They are likewise in the habit of asking for ear rings, nose rings, bracelets, crescents, and anklets. This is the contemporary custom in Moslem countries. However, the inhabitants of the land of the uncircumcised<sup class="footnote-marker">404</sup><i class="footnote">Christian countries.</i> do not act in this manner. Scripture similarly speaks of a sorceress,<sup class="footnote-marker">405</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 22:17 states, <i>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</i>. The same applies to a sorcerer.</i> as women are more involved in witchcraft than men.<sup class="footnote-marker">406</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 67a, <i>Yerushalmi Sanhedrin</i> 7:3, and Rashi and I.E. on Ex. 22:17.</i>
AND OF HER THAT SOJOURNETH IN HER HOUSE. For the Israelites owned land.<sup class="footnote-marker">407</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they had rooms or houses to rent to Egyptians. See I.E. on Gen. 47:27.</i>Some complain and say that our ancestors were thieves.<sup class="footnote-marker">408</sup><i class="footnote">For they asked the Egyptians for goods and had no intention of returning them or paying for them.</i> Can’t these murmurers see that this was a command from on high? There is no sense in asking why? God created everything. He gives riches to whom He desires to give it, and when He wishes to, He takes the very same riches away. There is no evil in this, as everything is His.
AND YE SHALL SPOIL. <i>Ve-nitzaltem</i> (and ye shall despoil) is like <i>ve-dibbartem</i> (and speak ye)<sup class="footnote-marker">409</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>ve-nitzaltem</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>.</i> (Num. 20:8), for it is possible that its form is that of the <i>nifal</i> conjugation.<sup class="footnote-marker">410</sup><i class="footnote">The word also looks like a <i>nifal</i>. However, in this case <i>ve-nitzaltem</i> means and ye shall be despoiled, an impossible rendering, for it was Israel that was doing the despoiling. Hence I.E.’s note that <i>ve-nitzaltem</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>, i.e., active, not passive. Krinsky quotes a reading: It is not possible that its form is that of the <i>nifal</i>.</i> Compare, <i>ve-niggaftem</i> (and ye shall be smitten) (Lev. 26:17).

Chapter 4



Verse 1

AND MOSES ANSWERED. God indicated<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, told.</i> to Moses that the elders would believe in him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. was bothered by the following: since God told Moses, <i>And they shall hearken to thy voice</i> (Ex. 3:18) why did Moses now say, <i>But, behold, they will not believe me</i>.</i> However, He did not mention this explicitly. <i>And they shall hearken to thy voice</i> (Ex. 3:18) relates only to behavior and not to inner belief.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Thus God never actually told Moses that he would be believed. It should be noted that Nahmanides had a different reading of I.E. According to Nahmanides, I.E. offers two answers to the question raised (see note 2). God told Moses that the elders would believe. He did not tell him that the people would believe. <i>And they shall hearken to thy voice</i> only relates to behavior, not to inner belief.</i>

Verse 2

AND THE LORD SAID. This sign<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The staff becoming a serpent.</i> was not given to Moses so that he would believe, because He had already given him the sign of the bush.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The burning bush convinced Moses of the truth of his mission.</i> God performed this sign for Moses so that Moses would imitate it before the children of Israel. It is therefore written, <i>that they may believe</i> (v. 5), which means, thus shall you do before them. God gave Moses a sign via an object that was always with him, the staff, Moses’ walking stick, as is the custom with elders.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was then 80 years old and walked with a staff (Krinsky).</i> Moses would not appear as a shepherd before Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the staff in his hand was not a shepherd’s staff but the staff of an elder.</i>

Verse 3

AND HE SAID. Those versed in the sciences ask,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, <i>chakhme ha-mechkar</i> (philosophers professing materialistic principles) (Friedlander).</i> how is this possible?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For a staff to be turned into a serpent by being cast upon the ground.</i> They were forced<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To conclude by their philosophic inquiries.</i> to conclude that it was to remove the dryness.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The dry wood of the staff became moist by coming into contact with the ground. It was then fit for life to enter it (Zarza). This explanation of course appears ridiculous to a modern person.</i> However, all their words are empty wind, as we are dealing with a wondrous event, one that did not occur according to the laws of nature. 

Verse 4

Yefet says that this wonder was a hint,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">About Pharaoh. It explained Pharaoh’s nature.</i> as Pharaoh was at first soft<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">By soft, I.E. means an object not inherently evil. Pharaoh at first did not oppress the Israelites.</i> like a staff and then turned into a serpent. It is written, <i>Pharaoh King of Egypt, The great serpent</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew <i>tannim</i>. J.P.S. translates it as dragon. However, Yefet rendered it as serpent.</i> (Ezek. 29:3). At the end he ended up the way he started; he was like one that never existed.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Like the serpent which turned back to a staff. Pharaoh the serpent of the Nile was defanged and broken like a dry stick.</i>

Verse 5



Verse 6

AND THE LORD SAID. The first sign was performed upon the staff that was found in Moses’ hand. The second one was executed on Moses’ very hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Which became leprous. This raises a question: Leprosy is usually a sign of punishment. (Cf. Num. 12:10; II Chron. 26:20.) This being the case, why was Moses punished?</i> Yefet says that his hand became leprous because he suspected that the Israelites would not believe him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">So too the sages of the Talmud and Midrash. Cf. <i>Sabbath</i> 57a; <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 3:12. Similarly Rashi. It is hard to understand why I.E. would quote a Karaite when he had traditional sources at his disposal that said the same thing.</i> However, if this were the case,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses was being punished.</i> this should have been the first sign.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">First Moses should have been punished by having his hand turned leprous and then shown the sign of the staff turning into a serpent.</i> Rabbi Joshua says that this was a hint<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Moses was not being punished.</i> about Israel, who at first were free and then God plagued them with Egyptian bondage, and that God would eventually heal them and that they would be free once again.
AND THE LORD SAID. Saadiah Gaon says that <i>chek</i> (bosom) refers to the sleeve of the arm. Similarly <i>u-ve-cheko yissa</i> (and carrieth them in his bosom) (Is. 40:11) and <i>sa’ehu ve-chekekha</i> (carry them in thy bosom) (Num. 11:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah Gaon <i>ve-cheko</i> means in his sleeve and <i>ve-chekekha</i> in your sleeve.</i> Others say that it refers to a garment that lies close to the chest.

Verse 7



Verse 8

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS. We know that God knew whether they would believe or not. Scripture, however, speaks with regard to Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Moses did not know how many signs he would have to do before all the people would believe him.</i> viz., if there will be some Israelites who will not believe the first sign, then they will believe the latter sign (<i>ha’ot ha-acharon</i>). Scripture speaks of <i>the voice of the sign</i>. Now a sign has no voice. The Torah, however, speaks in the language of man,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:26.</i> as it does in <i>Death and life are in the power of the tongue</i> (Prov. 18:21). Scripture speaks of <i>the latter sign</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture refers to the second sign as the latter sign (<i>ha’ot ha-acharon</i>). However, in view of the fact that there were three signs, Scripture should have referred to it as the second sign.</i> even though there were three signs, because God now showed only two signs to Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The second sign was thus the latter sign at that moment.</i> as He was yet to perform the third sign.

Verse 9

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS. If there shall still be a few Israelites that will not believe the last sign, then you will show them the third sign and they shall believe. Indeed, it is written, <i>and</i> (Moses) <i>did the signs in the sight of the people</i> (v. 30). This third sign, namely, <i>and the water…shall become blood upon the dry land</i> was part of the first of the ten plagues which were destined to come.

Verse 10

AND MOSES SAID. All the commentaries agree that <i>bi</i> (oh) is to be taken as a supplicatory expression.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">It means please or pray.</i> However, Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi says that <i>bi</i> is an abridgement. It is short for <i>bi ani adoni he-avon</i> (Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity) (I Sam. 25:24), that is, punish me as you wish<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains <i>avon</i> (iniquity) to mean punishment. See his comments on Gen. 4:13 and 43:20. Thus <i>bi ani adoni he-avon</i> means upon me, my lord be, the punishment.</i> but relieve me of this task and do not send me.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s elaboration of the implication of <i>bi ani adoni he-avon</i> in the context in which it is used in this verse.</i> Similarly <i>bi adoni yedabber na avdekha davar</i> (oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears) (Gen. 44:18). Its meaning is, do to me as you wish but allow me to speak.
A MAN OF WORDS. A person who knows how to speak elegantly, that is, a person who does not halt or stutter or have difficulty in enunciating certain letters. It is the custom of the Hebrews when they went to compare two or three things to add the word <i>gam</i> (also) to the first object,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Our text reads, <i>gam mi-temol gam mi-shilshom</i> (neither heretofore), <i>gam me-az dabberekha el avdekha</i> (nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant). Literally translated, it means: also from yesterday and also from the third day, also since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant. The first “also” appears out of place hence I.E.’s comment. I.E. then goes on to explain what Scripture means by the third day.</i> as in <i>Rule over us, also you, also your son and also your son’s son</i> (Jud. 8:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This is the literal rendition of the verse. J.P.S. translates somewhat differently.</i>
[HERETOFORE.] The explanation of the word <i>shilshom</i> (third day)<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. heretofore. See note 29.</i> is as follows. The word <i>temol</i> (yesterday)<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. heretofore. See note 29.</i> refers to the day before the one in which the person is speaking. <i>Shilshom</i> thus refers to the third day from which the person is speaking.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>shilshom</i> (the third day) means three days ago. The point is that the Bible uses <i>temol</i> and <i>shilshom</i> back to back. Since <i>temol</i> means yesterday the word <i>shilshom</i> must mean three says ago, not the third day to come.</i> The <i>mem</i> in <i>shilshom</i> is the <i>mem</i> of the plural<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The masculine pronominal plural suffix.</i> as it refers to today and yesterday,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>shilshom</i> means their third day, i.e., today’s and yesterday’s third day (Weiser).</i> even though its <i>shin</i> is not vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> as the rules of grammar require.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">If the meaning of <i>shilshom</i> is their third day (<i>shalosh she-lahem</i>) the word should have read <i>shilsham</i>.</i> On the other hand, it is possible that the <i>mem</i> is appended at the end of the word as it is to the beginning of the word.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the <i>mem</i> of <i>shilshom</i> is not the <i>mem</i> of the plural. It is a form (or superfluous) letter and has no meaning.</i> Compare, the word <i>mishlosh</i> (three)<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mem</i> in <i>mishlosh</i> has no meaning. See I.E. on Gen. 35:24.</i> in <i>And it came to pass about three months after</i> (Gen. 38:24).
NOR SINCE THOU HAST SPOKEN. <i>Me-az dabberkha</i> (since thou hast spoken)<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>az</i> means then. Hence I.E.’s comment that <i>me-az</i> means from the time or since.</i> is to be rendered, from the time that thou hast spoken. <i>Me-az</i> (since) in <i>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name</i> (Ex. 5:23) is similar, as<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The reason that Moses said what is recorded in our verse.</i> the slowness of his speech was not removed<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">By God when He revealed Himself to Moses.</i> but remained as it was. The one who says that Moses forgot Egyptian<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This commentator explains that slowness of speech and tongue refers not to a speech impediment but rather to Moses’ inability to speak Egyptian. The latter interpretation is offered by Rashbam.</i> is incorrect, because Moses mentioned two things, viz., slowness of speech and slowness of tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">If the reference was merely to difficulty in speaking Egyptian, Moses would have limited himself to slowness of speech.</i> Furthermore, we can learn from God’s answer, <i>Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh a man dumb?</i> that Moses was not referring to the Egyptian language.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">God appears to be addressing a complaint about a physical impediment rather than one dealing with a lack of knowledge.</i> The upshot of this is that Moses was born with slowness of speech; i.e., he could not pronounce the labials or all of the linguals.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Slowness of speech indicates a problem with labials, for the Hebrew word for speech is <i>safah</i> (lips). Slowness of tongue indicates a problem with linguals.</i> However, he was able to pronounce some of them with difficulty. This is the meaning of, <i>and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak</i>; i.e., God told Moses that He would teach him to speak with words that do not contain letters that he had difficulty enunciating.

Verse 11

AND THE LORD SAID. We find<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> <i>dumb</i> corresponding to the <i>making of the mouth, blind</i> corresponding to <i>seeing</i>, while the word deaf stands by itself; it has no counterpart. However, in reality the word <i>pike’ach</i> (seeing) corresponds both to blind and to deaf,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>peh, kof, chet</i>, which means to open. Thus <i>pike’ach</i> can refer to one who can either hear or see.</i> as it is written, <i>pako’ach oznayim</i> (opening the ears) (Is. 42:20); <i>li-feko’ach enayim ivrot</i> (to open the blind eyes) (Is. 42:7). 

Verse 12

Behold, God did not now<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">As our verse may be taken to imply.</i> promise Moses that He would remove the slowness of his tongue. He only promised to teach him what to speak.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 12.</i>

Verse 13

AND HE SAID. I have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 12:11.</i> that the word <i>na</i> (I pray) always means now in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>shlach na</i> (send, I pray) means send now.</i> See, <i>Speak now</i> (na) <i>in the ears of the people</i> (Ex. 11:2); <i>Hear now</i> (na), <i>O Joshua the high priest</i> (Zech. 3:8); <i>Let this man, now</i> (na)<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. J.P.S. translates as, <i>We pray thee</i>.</i> <i>be put to death</i> (Jer. 38:4); <i>Woe now</i> (na)<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. J.P.S. translation reads, <i>Woe unto us;</i> i.e., it does not translates <i>na</i>.</i> <i>unto us! for we have sinned</i> (Lam. 5:16).
WHOM THOU WILT SEND. The word <i>asher</i> (whom) has been omitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">From the clause <i>shelach na be-yad tishlach</i> (send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send). Its literal meaning is: send, I pray Thee (or now) by the hand of Thou wilt send, hence I.E.’s comment that the word <i>asher</i> (whom, i.e., he whom) has to be added to the text. The word <i>asher</i> can mean which, that, who, or in order to.</i> Our verse is to be read as if written <i>be-yad asher tishlach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Which means via the hand of him whom you were in the habit of sending, i.e., Aaron. Rashi interprets similarly.</i> <i>Im levavam shalem</i> (whose heart is whole) (II Chron. 16:9) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>asher</i> has to be added to the clause which is to be read as if written, <i>asher im levavam shalem</i> (of them whose heart is whole).</i> Its meaning is, send this message by the hand of Aaron my brother<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, Aaron his brother.</i> who is <i>a man of words</i>, for he is not of slow speech and he is in the habit of prophesying to Israel. Indeed, it is written in the book of Ezekiel that God sent a prophet to Israel before he sent our master Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezek. 20:5. I.E. identifies this prophet with Aaron.</i> Scripture also states, <i>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the wilderness to meet Moses</i> (Ex. 4:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that Aaron was a prophet, as God spoke to him.</i> Furthermore, since Aaron was older than Moses, he might be angry if Moses was appointed God’s messenger to Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Moses suggested that God appoint Aaron to this task.</i> It is for this reason that God told Moses, <i>and when he</i> (Aaron) <i>seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart</i> (Ex. 4:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Aaron is not angry that you, his younger brother, have been chosen as God’s messenger.</i> Now Moses did not refuse to go.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">As God’s messenger, as a superficial reading of verses 10-14 implies.</i> 
What happened was that Moses first replied, <i>I am not a man of words</i> (v. 10), and it is difficult for one who is slow of speech to speak before the king. Moses thought that God<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">In response to Moses’ reply, <i>I am not a man of words</i>.</i> would miraculously remove his slowness of speech. However, when God answered him, <i>and</i> (I) <i>will teach thee what thou shalt speak</i> (v. 12), Moses knew that his slowness of speech would not be removed. Moses thus wondered why God did not send Aaron to Pharaoh. It is for this reason that he said, <i>send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send</i>. All of this can be clearly derived from God’s answer, <i>Is not Aaron thy brother…</i> (v. 14).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Is not Aaron thy brother</i> implies that Moses suggested that Aaron be chosen in his place. <i>When he</i> (Aaron) <i>seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart</i> implies that Aaron is not angry for not being chosen. <i>He</i> (Aaron) <i>can speak well</i> implies that Moses was concerned with not being able to speak before the king.</i>

Verse 14

AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED. Heaven forbid that this be the meaning of the verse, <i>that the Lord…sought to kill him</i> (v. 24),<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">That is, God sought to slay Moses (v. 24) because he at first refused the Lord’s call to be His messenger. See Rashbam on verse 24.</i> as he should have killed him now when he refused to go, not when he went, as others have interpreted. Why kill him when he went?<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24 describes what happened to Moses on his way to Egypt as God’s messenger.</i> Our case cannot be compared to that of Balaam.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Where God told Balaam that he may go to Balak (Num. 22:20) and then sent an angel with a drawn sword to stop him (Num. 22:22), for Balaam had evil intentions (Krinsky).</i> Similarly, the incident with Jacob is different.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 32:25 tells us that an angel tried to kill Jacob. However, that incident too cannot be compared to that of Balaam, for that angel was not sent to punish Jacob. So Filwarg. For other interpretations see Krinsky and Weiser. However, their interpretations are forced.</i> Should someone argue, where do we find a case where God’s anger did not cause harm,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">That is, once the <i>anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses</i> punishment had to follow. The only punishment that conceivably followed was <i>that the Lord sought to kill him</i>.</i> we will show him, <i>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them</i> (Num. 12:9),<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Against Aaron and Miriam.</i> yet no harm befell Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Thus punishment does not always follow the kindling of God’s anger.</i>Scripture refers to Aaron as <i>the Levite</i>, for this is the way the Levite prophet<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Aaron.</i> was known in Israel since there were others who bore this name.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">There were other people who bore the name Aaron. Hence people referred to the Aaron who was the prophet as Aaron the Levite.</i> Now Aaron’s appointment as spokesman<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, this thing.</i> did not entail Moses’ demotion. On the contrary, Moses’ status was thereby elevated. Aaron was merely an instrument, similar to the mouth which brings forth the words of the invisible soul which, like the angels, cannot be seen because they are incorporeal. Moses’ station was thus similar to the station of an angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was the “soul” of the words produced by Aaron.

Verse 17

AND…THIS ROD. Scripture refers to <i>the signs</i><sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture speaks of this rod, <i>wherewith thou shalt do the signs</i>. However, up to now Scripture speaks of only one sign that was to be done with the rod, i.e., its being changed into a serpent.</i> because the rod changed into a serpent before all of Israel and into a serpent before Pharaoh. The rod was also used to strike the Nile, to bring up frogs, to produce gnats, to bring down hail, to bring locusts, and to cause darkness.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Many other signs were to be done with the rod in the future.

Verse 18

AND MOSES WENT…JETHER.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">This is the Hebrew reading. J.P.S. translates it as Jethro.</i> Jether and Jethro are one and the same.

Verse 19

AND THE LORD SAID. The Torah is not<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Always.</i> in chronological order.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">What is reported in verse 19 had to take place before what is recorded in verse 18.

Now when Moses was handing over Jethro’s sheep to Jethro, God assured him that he could go to Egypt without trepidation because Pharaoh and his servants who knew about the incident of the Egyptian were dead. This is the meaning of <i>that the king of Egypt died</i> (Ex. 2:23); as long as Pharaoh lived it was improper for Moses to be a messenger to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The same Pharaoh who knew of the incident of the Egyptian.</i>

Verse 20

AND MOSES TOOK. We do not know whether Gershom was born at the time that Moses was a young man, when he fled to Midian, or during his old age. Do not rely on <i>The History of Moses</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">A medieval work dealing with the life of Moses.</i> as everything written in it is nonsense. Moses’ second son, namely, Eliezer, was born now, at the time that Moses started to prophesy. Moses planned to bring his wife and sons to Egypt so that they could leave Egypt together with all of Israel. However, this was not a good idea; he was going to bring the Israelites out of Egypt and they would see that he came with his wife and children to live there.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the Israelites would have reason to doubt whether they were really going to be brought out of Egypt.</i> Do not be surprised that a prophet should incorrectly assess practical events,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">That is, do not be surprised that a prophet can err as Moses did in wanting to bring his family to Egypt.</i> for indeed we find that David asked Nathan the prophet whether is was proper for him to build a temple to the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">This is the import of II Sam. 7:2.</i> Nathan then answered him, <i>All that is in thy heart do, for the Lord is with thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s slight paraphrase of II Sam. 7:3.</i> However, in a prophetic vision of the night, Nathan was told to inform David that he should not build the temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">II Sam. 7:5-13.</i>The elders<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Who translated the Pentateuch into Greek.

This is not the place to use collective nouns.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">One uses the collective noun when one speaks of many of a kind. Here, at most two asses were involved and the use of the collective is out of place.</i> The term<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Ass.</i> thus must be taken literally.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to one ass.</i> Now the asses in Egypt are dearer and more precious than the mules.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Moses chose an ass rather than a mule for his family to ride upon.</i> There is nothing to wonder about<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Why Moses employed one ass for his family.

Perhaps he was small<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Young. See the opening of I.E.’s comment. This would make the scenario more acceptable, and not be demeaning to Moses.</i> and Eliezer was in her bosom for he was not yet circumcised.
[AND HE RETURNED TO THE LAND OF EGYPT.] Its meaning is that only Moses himself returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads, <i>And Moses took his wife and his sons…and <span class="underline">he </span>returned to Egypt</i>. Hence I.E’s comment.</i> When God met Moses (v. 24) Eliezer was circumcised (v. 25). When Eliezer was healed, Zipporah and her children returned to her father. Moses left them and went on to Egypt. 
Scripture refers to the staff as <i>the rod of God</i> because of the sign that was performed with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 4:1-4.</i> The rod of God is the same as the rod of Moses and the rod of Aaron. It was in his<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron’s (Weiser).</i> hand when he did the signs.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">When Aaron performed signs he held the rod. Hence it is also referred to as the rod of Aaron.</i> Now that the rod of God is mentioned Scripture backtracks and relates that God told Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">In general terms.</i> all the wonders that he was destined to do in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> He mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">That is, he specifically mentioned.</i> to Moses the sign that would bring Israel out of Egypt, namely, the plague of the first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i>
[AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE WAY AT THE LODGING-PLACE.] This should have been connected to <i>And Moses took his wife and his sons</i> (v. 20).<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">The sequence of events is: And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on an ass. And it came to pass on the way at the lodging place, etc. That which is between these verses is parenthetical.</i> There are many such cases in the Pentateuch, an example being, <i>he shall make restitution</i> (Ex. 22:2). The latter is connected to <i>he shall pay five oxen for an ox</i> (Ex. 21:37).<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">And not that which immediately precedes it.</i>

Verse 21

AND THE LORD SAID. This was told to Moses in Midian.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">When God told Moses, <i>Go return into Egypt</i> (v. 19) (Krinsky).</i> God informed Moses that He would harden Pharaoh’s heart and that Pharaoh would not let them go despite all of the wonders, including the last one,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The plague of the first-born.

Verse 22

AND THOU SHALT SAY. The meaning of <i>Israel is My son, My first-born</i><sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">And what follows, i.e., verse 23.</i> is: the ancestors of this nation were the first to serve Me. I therefore take pity on this nation as a father pities a son who serves him. You took him for a perpetual slave. I will therefore kill your first-born son.

Verse 23

AND I HAVE SAID UNTO THEE. Behold, I have told you time and time again to let My son go, that he may serve Me by offering sacrifices to Me, and thou hast refused to let him go. I will therefore punish thee.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of verse 23.</i> The ignorant say that these words are directed at Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Moses refused to go to Egypt to liberate God’s first-born son (Israel). God therefore threatened to kill Moses’ son. This explains the sequence which follows in verse 24.</i> The latter is sheer madness. Furthermore, Eliezer<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">The son of Moses that God wanted to kill (v. 24).</i> was not Moses’ first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">If God wanted to kill Moses’ first-born because Moses did not have pity on His first-born, then Gershom should have been threatened.</i>

Verse 24

AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE WAY. They had a tradition that a child should not be circumcised on the eighth day if he was sick, or while traveling when it was not possible for his guardian to tarry and circumcise him. Now because Moses could not tarry in carrying out God’s mission he concluded that he should not circumcise his son, because the child would be in danger if he were taken along.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">After circumcising him.</i> God therefore sent an angel<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of <i>that the Lord met him</i>.</i> to tell Moses to put his decision aside<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Not to circumcise Eliezer.</i> and to circumcise the lad. The child would then remain with his mother until healed and Moses would continue on by himself.
[THAT THE LORD MET HIM.] Its meaning is that God sent an illness upon Moses because it did not occur to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">To circumcise his son at that time. I.E. literally reads: Its meaning is, an illness came upon Moses from God that he did not think.</i> This then is the meaning of <i>and sought to slay him</i>: God sought to slay Moses if he would not circumcise his son. Now because Moses was seized with trembling<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">He was shivering due to the illness.</i> he could not circumcise his son. Zipporah circumcised him, for Moses revealed this secret to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">That he was ill because he did not circumcise his son.</i> Do not be surprised that it is written, <i>That the Lord met him</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains that God sent an angel to tell Moses to desist from his decision. However, the verse implies that it was God Himself who met Moses.</i> the reference is to an angel of the Lord. <i>And the Lord went before them</i> (Ex. 13:21) is similar, and there it is written, <i>And the angel of God…removed</i> (Ex. 14:19). However, Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">The last Gaon of Sura. He died in 1034 C.E.</i> says: Perish the thought that God would seek to slay Moses who was on God’s mission to redeem His people. It was rather Eliezer whom the Lord sought to slay, and it is to Eliezer that the third person pronominal suffixes of <i>va-yifgeshehu</i> (met him) and <i>hamito</i> (slay him) refer. Scripture then goes on to explain that the reference is to Eliezer.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to her son. The name Eliezer is not used in our passage.</i> Scripture therefore states, <i>and cut off the foreskin of her son</i>. He is not at first mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture refers to Eliezer by the term <i>him</i>. However, before referring to a person in the third person, one has to first identify him. I.E. thus explains that Scripture does not identify the object of <i>va-yifgeshehu</i> and <i>hamito</i> because he did not yet have a name.</i> because he did not as yet have a name. <i>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand</i> (Gen. 38:28) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not identify the one that put out his hand because he was not yet named.</i>

Verse 25

THEN ZIPPORAH TOOK A FLINT. A sharp instrument.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the word <i>tsor</i> (flint) is not to be translated as flint but as something sharp and hard as a flint, that is, a sharp instrument.</i> Compare, <i>Make thee knives of flint</i><sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tzurim</i>.</i> (Josh. 5:2) which refers to sharp knives. <i>Yea, thou turnest back the flint</i> (tzur) <i>of his sword</i><sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. translates as <i>edge of his sword</i>.</i> (Ps. 89:44) is similar.
[AND CAST IT AT HIS FEET.] In my opinion the reference is to Moses’ feet. Our verse is like<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the placing of the bloody foreskin on Moses’ feet was similar to the placing of the blood on the side-posts and lintels of the Israelite homes; i.e., it prevented the destroyer from killing.</i> <i>and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel, and upon the side-posts, the Lord…will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to destroy you</i> (Ex. 12:23). Therefore<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Because of what Zipporah did.</i> <i>He let him</i>, that is, Moses, <i>alone;</i> his illness and shivering ceased. However, Rabbi Samuel<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni.</i> says that <i>his feet</i> refers to Eliezer’s feet,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Samuel’s comment is in keeping with his interpretation that it was Eliezer rather than Moses who took ill.</i> and similarly <i>He let him alone</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is again to Eliezer.</i> This being the case we can refute him by asking, “If the illness befell Eliezer how could Zipporah circumcise him, thereby adding pain to his pain?”<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">The idea is that it would be either dangerous or cruel.</i>
[A BRIDEGROOM OF BLOOD.] It is the custom of women to refer to a child as a bridegroom when he is circumcised.
[BLOOD.] Its meaning is, <i>surely thou art a man of blood to me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. II Sam. 16:8, <i>because</i> (surely) <i>thou art a man of blood</i>. Thus <i>blood</i> means bloody.</i> for because of you my husband will die.

Verse 26

SO HE LET HIM ALONE. The word <i>damim</i> (blood) in Hebrew is used in two ways. One way is to indicate bloodshed, as in <i>because thou art a man of blood to me</i> (II Sam. 16:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">“To me” is not found in the verse quoted. I.E., under the influence of his comment on the word <i>blood</i>, added the words <i>to me</i> to II Sam. 16:8.</i> The person who says that <i>damim</i> refers to life<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">This commentary takes blood to mean life because a living person has blood flowing through him. According to this commentary, <i>Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me</i> means: Surely a live bridegroom are thou (Moses) to me; i.e., thou art alive because I circumcised Eliezer. Similarly the word <i>blood</i> in the next verse. It should be noted that in Ex. 22:2 Rashi explains <i>dam</i> (blood) as alive and I.E. takes issue with him there (Filwarg).</i> is giving the word a meaning that it does not have. The second way<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">That the word <i>damim</i> is used.</i> is as a plural referring to actual blood,<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">The singular being <i>dam</i>.</i> as in <i>be-damayikh chayi</i> (in thy blood live) (Ezek. 16:6). Now when Zipporah saw that the illness left Moses she exclaimed, you my son are not a bridegroom of blood, blood referring to death,<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">That is, you are not a bloody bridegroom.</i> but you are a bridegroom wallowing in the blood of circumcision. The word <i>mulot</i> (circumcision) is a noun. It is in the plural<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i>, the singular should have been used.</i> because of <i>damim</i> (blood).<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Damim</i> which precedes <i>mulot</i> is in the plural; i.e., the word <i>mulot</i> is in the plural because it follows <i>damim</i>.</i>

Verse 27

AND THE LORD SAID TO AARON. Aaron did not prophesy;<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">God told Aaron, <i>Go into the wilderness to meet Moses</i>. He did not tell him to prophesy before Pharaoh (Weiser).</i> there was no need for him to do so<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Henceforth.</i> as Moses was the messenger sent to Pharaoh. However, prior to this Aaron had been sent as messenger to the male Israelites, and Miriam to the females. The prophet therefore says, <i>And I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam</i> (Micah 6:4).
IN THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD. The reference is to Mount Horeb.

Verse 28

AND MOSES TOLD. God sent Moses to Israel first.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Besides sending Moses to Pharaoh, God also told Moses to speak to Israel before speaking to Pharaoh, Hence Moses and Aaron went first to the children of Israel.</i>
AND ALL THE SIGNS WHEREWITH HE HAD CHARGED HIM. To first perform before Israel and then to perform other signs before Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Moses first performed signs before Israel (v. 30) and only later before Pharaoh (Ex. 7:10).</i>

Verse 29

AND MOSES AND AARON WENT. <i>The elders</i> are the counselors in each generation,<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, elders means counselors. In medieval Spain the Jews were ruled in part by a <i>mo’etzah</i>, a board of counselors. I.E. apparently assumes that each generation going back to Moses had a similar arrangement with the exception that in previous times they were referred to as <i>zekenim</i> (elders) rather than <i>yo’atzim</i> (counselors).</i> as Moses and Aaron could not possibly speak to six hundred thousand men. It was rather the elders who spoke to them.

Verse 30

AND AARON SPOKE. For he was Moses’ mouthpiece.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Melitz</i> literally means interpreter.</i> Moses therefore never spoke to Israel except through Aaron. When Aaron died his son Eleazar took his place and similarly became Moses’ mouthpiece.

Verse 2

AND PHARAOH SAID: WHO IS THE LORD, THAT I SHOULD HEARKEN UNTO HIS VOICE. He asked, “Who is the Lord that he is God?”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh was not denying God. He merely asked, “Who is this God <i>YHVH</i> (the Lord)?”</i> We learn this from Moses’ answer to Pharaoh, which follows.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Moses answered Pharaoh that <i>YHVH</i> is the God of the Hebrews. We deduce from this that Pharaoh had asked, “Who is this God <i>YHVH</i>?”</i>

Verse 3

AND THEY SAID. This name<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Tetragrammaton.</i> refers to the God of the Hebrews. The Hebrews were a group whom the Egyptians were familiar with.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Moses identified <i>YHVH</i> as the God of the Hebrews.</i> The term Hebrew refers to Abraham, who is called the Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 14:13.</i> It likewise refers to Abraham’s son Isaac and to Jacob and his sons,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It thus applies to the Israelites, hence the term, “the God of the Hebrews.” I.E. explains that the term Hebrew refers to Israelites because there were some commentators who believed that it applied to non-Israelite descendants of Abraham. See I.E. Ex. 21:2.</i> as I will explain when I comment on the verse <i>if thou buy a Hebrew servant</i> (Ex. 21:2).
AND THEY SAID. The word <i>nikra</i> (hath met) is similar to <i>nikro nikreti</i> (as I happened by chance)<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for met comes from the root <i>kof, resh, heh</i> (<i>karah</i>). However, <i>nikra</i> (spelled with an <i>alef</i>) comes from the root <i>kof, resh, alef</i>. I.E. points out that the <i>alef</i> and the <i>heh</i> interchange. For <i>nikro</i> (<i>spelled with an alef</i>) comes from the root <i>kof, resh, alef</i> and means met, (happened by chance) while <i>nikreti</i> (I happened by chance), from the root <i>kof, resh, heh</i> (the <i>heh</i> changes to a <i>yod</i> in the perfect) has a similar meaning. We thus see that the word <i>nikrah</i>, whether spelled with an <i>alef</i> or a <i>heh</i>, means met.</i> in <i>As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa</i> (II Sam. 1:6). It means met. He explained to Pharaoh why they are obligated to offer sacrifices, i.e., lest a pestilence or sword come upon us.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or the sword</i>.</i>

On the contrary, they would go a distance of three days’ journey into the wilderness (Ps. 8:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">And offer sacrifices to the Lord.</i> The latter is the distance between Egypt and Mount Sinai for one who takes a straight path.

It was when the threat of locusts came that Pharaoh gave some of the Israelites permission to go and sacrifice.

After the plague of darkness Pharaoh gave them all permission to go, with the exception that their cattle were to remain (Ex. 11:24). Now when they saw that a plague came and struck their first-born, Moses’ words, <i>lest he fall upon us with pestilence</i>, became clear.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">They realized that they were included, as noted by I.E. earlier in his comment on <i>us</i> in verse 3.</i> They therefore said, <i>We are all dead men</i> (Ex. 12:33).

Verse 4

AND THE KING OF EGYPT SAID. The word <i>tafri’u</i> (ye cause to break loose) means ye cause to disrupt.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">That is, ye cause the people to spoil their work schedule (Krinsky).

Verse 22

AND MOSES RETURNED.

Verse 23

FOR SINCE. From the day that I spoke to Pharaoh he hardened his yoke over them, as it is written, <i>And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people</i> (v. 6).
[NEITHER HAST THOU DELIVERED.] My very thought was that Pharaoh would begin to lighten their burden<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">As soon as I came to him and told him to free Israel.</i> and You would begin to deliver them.

God who is Almighty and also awe inspiring, placed before us the secret of the Torah. I will now begin to explain the Torah portion called, <i>And I Appeared</i>.

Verse 2

AND GOD SPOKE. Scripture reads, <i>And the people believed</i> (Ex. 4:31). The latter implies that not all of the people believed. Everyone including Pharaoh, as I will yet explain,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 8:15; 9:28.</i> admitted to the existence of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As an impersonal power. However, they did not know Him as a personal God who is concerned with man, i.e, as the Lord.</i> Scripture therefore says, <i>And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: I am the Lord</i> (v. 2); <i>Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am the Lord</i> (v. 6); <i>and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God</i> (v. 7).

Verse 3

AND I APPEARED. The patriarchs received their prophesies in visions of the night, hence the term <i>And I appeared</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies, I appeared in a vision. The Hebrew word for vision (<i>mareh</i>) and the word for, and I appeared (<i>va-era</i>) come from the same root, <i>resh, alef, heh</i>.</i>
[ALMIGHTY.] It is difficult to explain the word <i>Shaddai</i> (Almighty).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is not self-evident.</i> Saadiah Gaon says that the <i>shin</i> of <i>Shaddai</i> is a preposition, like the <i>shin</i> prefixed to <i>she-attah</i> (that it is thou) in <i>that it is thou that talkest with me</i> (Jud. 6:17). The meaning of <i>Shaddai</i> is: Who said to the world, enough.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah Gaon, <i>Shaddai</i> is composed of two words, <i>she-dai</i> (who is enough). He further explained that <i>she-dai</i> is short for <i>she-amar le’olam dai</i>. Saadiah Gaon apparently interprets <i>Shaddai</i> as meaning the one who controls or sets a limit on nature. See <i>Hagigah</i> 12a, “What is the meaning of <i>ani El Shaddai</i> (Gen. 17:1)? Its meaning is: I am (<i>ani</i>) the God (<i>El</i>) who said to my world <i>dai</i> (enough). Resh Lakish said: When the Holy One created the sea, it went spreading on until the Holy One rebuked it and made it dry (i.e., said to it, enough).”</i> However, I cannot see any meaning in this interpretation. How can God be called by the name “Who is enough?”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. was bothered by having a proper name that opens with a prefix (the <i>shin</i>) (Krinsky).</i> <i>Shaddai</i> therefore can only be taken as an adjective, like the words <i>tov</i> (good) and <i>sallach</i> (ready to pardon) in <i>good, and ready to pardon</i> (Ps. 86:5) and <i>davvai</i> (faint)<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>shin</i> in <i>Shaddai</i> is not a prefix but an integral part of the word, like the <i>dalet</i> in <i>davvai</i> and the <i>samekh</i> in <i>sallach</i>.</i> in <i>My heart is faint within me</i> (Jer. 8:18). Now Rabbi Samuel the Nagid explains <i>Shaddai</i> with the Arabic word <i>al kahar</i>, which means victorious and mighty. He further notes that the <i>yod</i> in <i>Shaddai</i> is in place of the double letter,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Nagid the root of <i>Shaddai</i> is <i>shin, dalet, dalet</i>. (Cf. I.E. on Gen. 17:1 and the notes thereto.) <i>Shaddai</i> is spelled <i>shin, dalet, yod</i>. Thus one <i>dalet</i> is missing. Rabbi Samuel says that the <i>yod</i> takes the place of the <i>dalet</i>.</i> like the <i>yod</i> in <i>dalyu</i> (hang limp)<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which is <i>dalet, lamed, lamed</i>. A <i>lamed</i> is missing in <i>dalyu</i> and is made up by the <i>yod</i>.</i> in <i>The legs hang limp from the lame</i> (Prov. 26:7) and the <i>alef</i> in <i>baze’u</i> (divide)<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>baze’u</i> is <i>bet, zayin, zayin</i>. A <i>zayin</i> is missing in <i>baze’u</i> and is made up by the <i>alef</i>.</i> in <i>Whose land the rivers divide</i> (Is. 18:2). <i>Shaddai</i> (mighty) in <i>like a mighty voice</i> (Ezek. 1:24)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> and <i>Shaddai</i> (mighty) in <i>And mighty shall he thy silver</i> (Job 22:25)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.

The Nagid explained it well.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. agrees with the Nagid that <i>Shaddai</i> means mighty or the Almighty.</i>
[I MADE ME NOT KNOWN TO THEM.] The word <i>nodati</i> (I made Me known) is in the <i>nifal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Its literal meaning is, I was known.</i> It is not like <i>hodati</i> (I made known)<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Which is in the <i>hifil</i>.

However, God himself never used that name when He revealed Himself to the patriarchs.</i> However, Rabbi Joshua is incorrect, for how would Moses dare to write a name that God did not utter.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">If in revealing himself to Abraham God said, “I am <i>El Shaddai</i> who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees,” would Moses deliberately dare to write, “I am <i>YHVH</i> that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees” (Gen. 15:7).</i> There is no doubt that the patriarchs knew the name <i>YHVH</i> as a proper name. However, they did not know it as an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>but My name YHVH I made Me not known to them</i> means, they did not know the adjectival meaning of <i>YHVH</i>; that is, they did not experience the adjectival meaning of My name <i>YHVH, viz.</i>, My suspending the laws of nature (Krinsky).</i> 
I will now reveal to you part of the secret meaning of the name <i>El Shaddai</i>. We know that God created the three worlds that I have previously noted.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 3:15 and the notes thereto.</i> Everything in the lowest world receives power from the middle world according to the arrangements<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The arrangement of the stars.</i> in the higher world. Due to the fact that man’s soul comes from above the middle world, if it is wise and recognizes the works of God, both those done without an intermediary<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">That is, sees the hand of God when He suspends natural law.</i> and those done via an intermediary<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Sees the hand of God in the normal working of the world which ordinarily is under the influence of the heavenly constellations.</i> and if the soul forsakes the pleasures of this lowest world and separates itself from them to cleave to God the glorious, should there be at the time of the birth of such a person an arrangement of the stars indicating that evil will befall this man on a certain day, the God to whom this man cleaves will set the chain of events in such a way that this man is saved from the evil that was destined to befall him. Similarly, if it is in the arrangement of the stars that this man be sterile God will make him virile and he will sire children. Therefore our sages said that God told Abraham, “Leave your astrological calculations.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sabbath</i> 156a, “Abraham said before the Holy One Blessed Be He…I have searched my constellation and have found that I am incapable of having a son. Leave your astrological calculations, said the Lord to him, for Israel has no star.” Also see <i>Nedarim</i> 32a and Rashi on Gen. 15:5.</i> The statement “Israel has no star” is close in meaning to the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Israel’s fate is not determined by the stars, because Israel is under God’s direct influence. See I.E. on Deut. 4:19.</i> I will yet explain this in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 33:22.</i> Therefore, before God said to Abraham, <i>and I will multiply thy seed</i>, he told him, <i>I am God Almighty</i> (El Shaddai) (Gen. 17:1), the meaning of which is: I overcome the upper arrangements. The aforementioned does not mean that the arrangements are destroyed. It rather means that the one who cleaves to God knows that God creates good things for him that are not in keeping with what the stars have determined for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, his arrangements.</i> Jacob therefore said, <i>the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil</i> (Gen. 48:16), i.e., all evil that was destined<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">By the arrangement of the stars.</i> to come upon me. This is, as I will explain, the secret of the whole Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah teaches man to cleave to the Lord. The latter places man under the providence of God rather than that of the stars (Krinsky).</i> Now the patriarchs did not reach the level where they were able to cleave unto God as Moses, <i>whom the Lord knew face to face</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 34:10.</i> did. Moses was therefore able to change the laws governing the lower world<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to suspend natural law.</i> and produce signs and wonders<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Changing a staff into a serpent, changing water into blood, splitting the sea, etc.</i> that the patriarchs were incapable of. Now Moses said two things to the Lord. One, <i>why is it that Thou hast sent me</i> (Ex. 5:22)? Two, <i>neither hast Thou delivered Thy people</i> (Ex. 5:23). God answered the latter with, <i>Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh</i> (v. 1). He answered the former<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Why is it that Thou hast sent me?</i></i> with, <i>I am the Lord</i> (v. 2).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">That is, I have chosen you to make My name <i>YHVH</i> known in the world.</i> The meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Of God’s response to Moses.</i> is that via the patriarchs My name <i>El Shaddai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Which indicates that God rules the constellations and thus can change destiny.</i> was publicized, but through you My revered name <i>YHVH</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Which indicates that God can suspend natural law.</i> will be known in the world. As God said, <i>Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am the Lord</i> (YHVH) (v. 6), the meaning of which is, behold, I have sent you to make this name known.

Verse 4

AND I HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED. I have also sent you because I have established my covenant with the patriarchs to give the land of Canaan to them or to their children who are their equivalent.

Verse 5

AND MOREOVER. I have also sent you because the children of Israel have repented<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 2:23.</i> and have cried out unto me.

Verse 6

WHEREFORE. As I live so will my word live. I will redeem you with an arm stretched from the heaven to the earth.

Verse 7

AND I WILL TAKE YOU TO ME. When you receive the Torah on Mount Sinai.
[WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT.] Its meaning is that according to the great combination of the stars in heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the upper ministers.</i> Israel was destined to remain in exile. This will be explained in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i>.

Verse 8

AND I WILL BRING YOU INTO THE LAND. For many of those who left Egypt entered Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Only those above the age of 20 died in the wilderness and did not enter Canaan. Thus the promise, <i>And I will bring you into the land</i> was fulfilled.</i> Additionally, their children are their equivalent.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The children of the generation that left Egypt are equivalent to their parents. Hence it is as if all those who left Egypt entered Canaan.</i>
[WHICH I LIFTED UP MY HAND.] This is to be understood figuratively. God is compared to a man who lifts up his hand to heaven and swears. It is like <i>For I lift up My hand to heaven</i> (Deut. 32:40) and <i>when he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven</i> (Dan. 12:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Which are not to be taken literally.</i>
[I AM THE LORD.] Its meaning is, I will cause this to come about.

Verse 9

AND MOSES SPOKE. Israel did not hearken nor pay attention to the words of Moses, as their spirit was impatient because of the length of their exile and the hard labor which was recently put upon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The decree to produce bricks without being given straw.</i>

Verse 10

AND THE LORD SPOKE…SAYING. To Moses. <i>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</i> (Lev. 1:2) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In that Scripture repeats itself in the same verse by saying, “ speak to” and “say to.”</i>

Verse 11

GO IN. To the king’s palace.

Verse 12

AND MOSES SPOKE BEFORE THE LORD, SAYING. <i>Behold, the children of Israel</i> who are thy people <i>have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh</i> who is a king, and is not a member of your people <i>hear me</i>. Furthermore, it is a great handicap for me who am <i>of uncircumcised lips</i> to speak before him. Before I went to see Pharaoh for the first time You promised me that You would instruct my mouth not to pronounce a letter which is too difficult for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 4:12.</i> However, now I may stumble in my words before him.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Since You did not repeat the promise this time.</i> Furthermore, You said that Aaron shall be the intermediary between me and Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">But not between me and Pharaoh. Hence, I must address Pharaoh directly. However, this is too difficult for me since I am of uncircumcised lips.</i>

Verse 13

AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND AARON. God now included all the details.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Pertaining to Aaron’s role as an intermediary.</i> Aaron was also going to be the intermediary between Moses and Pharaoh, as Scripture will go on to explain. God’s command was therefore directed to both of them.
AND GAVE THEM A CHARGE. To go <i>unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt</i>. However, Rabbi Joshua says that <i>and gave them a charge</i> means, and gave them a charge not to be angry at the children of Israel if they did not hearken unto them.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemot Rabba</i> 7:3 and Rashi interpret similarly.</i> This interpretation is unnecessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Since it requires that the verb <i>va-yetzavvem</i> (and gave them charge) apply to two different types of charges, one concerning Israel and one concerning Pharaoh. Cf. Rashi, “<i>and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel</i> to lead them gently and to be patient with them, <i>and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt</i> to verbally pay him respect.” Whereas according to I.E. the verb <i>va-yetzavvem</i> refers to one action, <i>viz.</i>, to go.</i>

Verse 14

THESE ARE THE HEADS OF THEIR FATHER’S HOUSES. Moses and Aaron’s father, or it refers to the children of Israel who are mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> The men mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">As heads.</i> were among those who descended to Egypt. Scripture starts with Reuben because the only honor left to him was to be listed first in the genealogy.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This honor was left him when the birthright was taken away from him. See I.E. Gen. 49:4.</i> These four sons of Reuben<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in our verse.</i> descended to Egypt.

Verse 15

AND THE SONS OF SIMEON. The family of Ohad was destroyed in Egypt or in the desert, as it is not mentioned in the Torah portion <i>Phinehas</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Num. 26:12, 13 lists the families of Simeon. Ohad is not listed.</i>
ZERAH. Zohar and Zerah are one and the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar is not mentioned in Num. 26:12, 13 but is listed here. Zerah, on the other hand, is listed in Numbers but not here. Similarly, Rashi in Numbers identifies the two as one. He argues that both Zohar and Zarah connote shining.</i>

Verse 16

THE SONS OF LEVI. These two tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Reuben and Simeon.</i> were mentioned first because they were older than Levi. Here Scripture is mainly concerned with Levi,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Thus there was no need to mention the tribes of Reuben and Simeon.</i> as the Torah has no other intention now than to list the genealogy of Moses and Aaron. Gershon, Kohath, and Merari are mentioned in the order of their birth. They descended to Egypt.
[THESE ARE THAT AARON AND MOSES.] Aaron is mentioned first because of his age.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">This note appears misplaced from verse 26. It is omitted in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38.</i> Scripture mentions how long Levi lived but does not do so for the other tribal patriarchs out of respect for Moses and Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Who descended from Levi.</i>

Verse 17

THE SONS OF GERSHON. He had no sons but these two.

Verse 18

AND THE SONS OF KOHATH. Scripture mentions how long Kohath lived but does not do the same for Gershon and Merari out of respect for the messengers.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Moses and Aaron, who descended from Kohath.</i>

Verse 19

AND THE SONS OF MERARI. His sons numbered two; there were no more. Scripture therefore says, <i>These are the families of the Levites according to their generations</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the family of Levi who descended to Egypt.</i> for those who descended to Egypt did not sire any children<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Only the children of those who came down to Egypt are enumerated in verses 16-19 (Weiser). I.E. is vague.</i> except for these sons of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">All of those who descended into Egypt are considered sons of Jacob. Hence they and their children are listed as comprising <i>the families of the Levites according to their generations</i>. I.E. reads, <i>ki lo holidu yorede mitzrayim rak eleh bene ya’akov</i>, which literally reads, “for those who descended to Egypt did not sire any children. Only these are the sons of Jacob.” The commentaries offer various emendations and interpretations. See Weiser, Filwarg, Krinsky, and Motot.</i> Scripture also mentions how long Amram lived,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to mentioning how long Kohath lived, Scripture also mentions how long Amram lived.</i> out of respect for his sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Moses and Aaron.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

AND THE SONS OF IZHAR. They are mentioned because of Korah who quarreled with Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise there is no reason to mention them, as neither they nor their fathers descended to Egypt.</i>

Verse 22

AND THE SONS OF UZZIEL. Uzziel is mentioned because of the honor given in the Torah to Mishael and Elzaphan.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">They are respectfully referred to in Lev. 10:4.</i> Scripture did not care to mention the sons of Hebron.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">There was no need to mention them here. See note 85.</i>

Verse 23

AND AARON TOOK. Aaron’s wife is mentioned out of respect for Eleazar.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Who succeeded to the priesthood after the death of his father Aaron.</i> Scripture notes that Elisheba was <i>the sister of Nahshon</i> because of the honor of the priesthood.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The sons of Aaron not only had a good pedigree from their father’s side but also from their mother’s side, as their mother was the daughter of the prince of Judah.</i> The sons of Korah are mentioned because they were righteous, as it is written, <i>Notwithstanding the sons of Korah died not</i> (Num. 26:11). The prophet Samuel was a descendant of Korah.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">See I Chron. 6:18-23.</i>

Verse 24



Verse 25

AND ELEAZAR. Eleazar’s wife is mentioned out of respect for Phinehas, as the priesthood was given to him eternally. Hence, logically speaking, Putiel was an Israelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Contra the Midrash, which derives the name Putiel from the words, <i>pittem</i> (fatten) and <i>pittpet</i> (conquered). The Midrash says that Eleazar’s wife was a descendant of Jethro, “who fattened calves for idols,” and Joseph, “who conquered his passions.” See <i>Sotah</i> 43a; <i>Baba Batra</i> 109b, <i>San</i>hedrin 82b and <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 67. I.E. disagrees, for he believes Putiel is mentioned to give respect to Phinehas, and it is no honor to have a pagan ancestor.</i> We do not know the meaning of Putiel as we do not know the meaning of Mishael and Aaron and all the other names that are mentioned. If what happened to Moses had not been recorded,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">That Pharaoh’s daughter named him Moses because she drew him out of the water.</i> we would not know why he was so called.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Without knowing the background behind the naming of Moses we could never guess why he was so called. Similarly, we cannot ascertain the meaning of Putiel.</i>

Verse 26

THESE ARE THAT AARON AND MOSES. Scripture mentions Aaron before Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Moses is the more important of the two.</i> because Aaron was older and also because he prophesied to Israel before the arrival of Moses.

Verse 27

THESE. Now from the time that they spoke to Pharaoh, Scripture mentions Moses before Aaron because of his great status. Indeed, God spoke to him face to face<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 12:8; 34:10.</i> and he alone drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20:18.</i> This was not the case with Aaron. Scripture testifies with regard to Moses, <i>My servant Moses is not so</i> (Num. 12:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Moses is unlike any other prophet. These words were addressed to Aaron and Miriam. We thus see that Moses was greater than Aaron.</i> Furthermore, Aaron said, <i>oh my lord</i> twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is imprecise. What he means is that Aaron referred to Moses as “my lord” twice, <i>viz.</i>, in Ex. 32:22 and in Num. 12:11. The phrase <i>oh my lord</i> is found only in the latter.</i> You will therefore not find in the entire Pentateuch starting from this verse Moses not mentioned before Aaron. The same holds true for the Prophets and similarly for the Writings. There is no argument to the contrary from <i>Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses</i> (Num. 3:1) or from, <i>and she bore unto Amram Aaron and Moses</i> (Num. 26:59), as Scripture lists them there in the order of their birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Scripture indicates that it is listing them in the order of their birth.</i> The words <i>generations</i> and <i>and she bore</i> is proof of this.

Verse 28

AND IT CAME TO PASS. One may wonder why the arranger of the chapters<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. does not believe that Moses arranged the chapters of the Torah. He apparently believes that the scribes did this.</i> did not<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. The printed editions omit “did not” (<i>lo</i>). However, it is obvious that is has to be inserted. Otherwise the comment makes no sense.</i> connect this verse with what follows it<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew edition of the Torah, verse 28 concludes a chapter.</i> when in fact it is dependent upon what comes next.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">That is, verse 30 continues the action of verse 29.</i> Though we know no reason for the above,<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Why these verses were placed in different chapters.</i> we do know that they are connected. <i>On the day when the Lord spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt</i> (v. 28) what he told him was, <i>I am the Lord; speak thou unto Pharaoh</i>. (v. 29). Similarly, <i>So, it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people</i> (Deut. 2:16) is connected to that which follows it.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 2:16 is connected to Deut. 2:17 although they are in different chapters in the Masoretic Bible.</i> Perhaps the one who arranged the places to stop knew why he did this,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">A sarcastic statement. It implies that there is a chance that the one who arranged the portions of the Bible might have erred in setting up the chapters.</i> as his mind was much greater than ours.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Hence we must give him the benefit of the doubt.</i>

Verse 29

THAT THE LORD SPOKE. Scripture now goes back to the subject of <i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron</i> (Ex. 6:13),<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture now goes back to the account interrupted at verse 13. Rashi interprets similarly.</i> namely, <i>Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt</i> (Ex. 6:11).

Chapter 7



Verse 1

I. AND THE LORD SAID. This was in response to, <i>how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips</i> (Ex. 6:12). God answered Moses, <i>See I have set thee in God’s stead to Pharaoh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Some of the printed editions of Ibn Ezra wrongly place this comment at the end of chapter 6.</i>
AND THE LORD SAID.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In some manuscripts I.E.’s comments on chapter 7 start with this note, hence the repetition of the opening quote.</i> Its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The clause to which I.E. refers to literally reads: See, I make thee a god (<i>elohim</i>) to Pharaoh.</i> is: See, I have greatly elevated your status in that in Pharaoh’s eyes your stature is that of an angel. This is what <i>God’s stead</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a god. On <i>elohim</i>, meaning an angel; see I.E.’s comments on Gen. 1:1.</i> means. <i>God</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the angel.</i> speaks to the prophet and the prophet speaks to the men of his generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, Moses will speak to Aaron, and Aaron will speak to Pharaoh.</i>
[AND AARON THY BROTHER SHALL BE THY PROPHET.] Those who say that the word <i>navi</i> (prophet) comes from the root of <i>niv</i> in <i>niv sefatayim</i> (the fruit of the lips) (Is. 57:19) err.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi: “All forms of the term <i>nevu’ah</i> (prophecy) refer to one who calls and preaches words of rebuke to the people. It comes from the root of <i>niv</i> in <i>niv sefatyim</i>.”</i> <i>Niv</i> comes from a two-letter root according to the French sages and from a hidden <i>ayin</i> root according to the Spanish sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">According to Filwarg and others the Spanish and French sages differ only in terminology. Both hold that <i>niv</i> comes from the root <i>nun, vav, bet</i>. The French sages refer to such a root as a two-letter root because the <i>vav</i> is usually dropped. For the same reason the Spanish sages refer to it as a hidden <i>ayin</i> root. However, Krinsky argues that the French sages disagree as to what the root of <i>niv</i> is. The former hold that <i>niv</i> comes from a two-letter root; i.e., its root is <i>nun, bet</i>, while the Spanish sages believe it to come from the root <i>nun, vav, bet</i>. Contemporary works on grammar refer to the latter as an <i>ayin vav</i>.</i> However, <i>navi</i> comes from a three-letter root.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>nun, bet, alef</i>.</i> That its <i>alef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>navi</i> is spelled <i>nun, bet, yod, alef</i>.</i> is a root letter can be seen from the words <i>nevi’im</i> (prophets) (Num. 11:29) and <i>va-yitnabe’u</i> (they prophesied).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Both words are spelled with an <i>alef</i>. If the <i>alef</i> was not a root letter these words would not have an <i>alef</i> in them.</i> Furthermore, the word <i>niv</i> in <i>niv sefatayim</i> means fruit,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than speech.</i> for <i>niv</i> comes from the same root as <i>tenuvah</i> (fruitage) (Is. 27:6) and <i>yenuvun</i> (they shall bring forth fruit) in <i>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age</i> (Ps. 92:15). <i>Ve-nivo nivzeh okhlo</i> (and the fruit thereof, even the food thereof, is contemptible) (Malachi 1:12) is true proof of this. Additionally, what meaning is there to, <i>restore the man’s wife; for he is a prophet</i> (Gen. 20:7) if <i>navi</i> (prophet) means a speaker. Its only meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>navi</i> (prophet) in Gen 20:7.</i> is, he is a prophet to whom I reveal my secrets, as in <i>But He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets</i> (Amos 3:7). He enjoys My presence therefore <i>and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live</i> (Gen. 20:7).

Verse 2

THOU SHALT SPEAK. To Aaron.
ALL THAT I COMMAND THEE; AND AARON THY BROTHER SHALL SPEAK UNTO PHARAOH. Even though Aaron is not mentioned every time<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">That Scripture records.</i> that Moses came to Pharaoh, we know that they always came together.

Verse 3

AND I WILL HARDEN PHARAOH’S HEART. The question arises: “If God hardened Pharaoh’s heart what was his transgression and what was his sin?”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i>, our verse states that God will harden Pharaoh’s heart and punish him for not mending his ways; i.e., I will harden Pharaoh’s heart and punish him for hardening his heart by multiplying “My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.”</i> The answer is: God granted wisdom to man and implanted in his heart the intelligence to receive power from on high to add to his good<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">If good things are destined to befall an individual he can increase the amount of good that will befall him by developing his intelligence. Individual Divine Providence is extended only to those who have developed their intellectual capacities. See Introduction to Vol. 1, p. XIII.</i> or to diminish his evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A person can decrease the evil that is destined to befall him by developing his intelligence. See preceding note.</i> I will explain this in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 31:18; 33:21.</i> and when I comment on the verse <i>Oh that they had such a heart as this alway</i> (Deut. 5:26). Now the meaning of our verse is: I will harden his heart in order to multiply My signs and My wonders.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">God prevented Pharaoh from developing his intellectual capacities; God did this not to punish Pharaoh but so that He would have a pretext for multiplying His signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. I.E. apparently held that man has free will. However, God occasionally takes it away when it serves His purpose to do so. For other interpretations, see Weiser and Krinsky.</i> Rabbi Joshua says that its meaning is: I will harden his heart so that he will be able to bear the plagues.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hence there is no problem as to why Pharaoh was punished for being obstinate; Pharaoh was a free agent. God; granted him the physical strength to bear His plagues. He did not take away Pharaoh’s free will.</i> However, he spoke incorrectly.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Joshua is wrong. Heart in Scripture refers to an individual’s mental rather than physical capacity. <i>And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart</i> thus does not mean I will give Pharaoh a strong heart so that he can bear up under the pressure of the plagues, but rather that I will, so to speak, dull his brain so that he does not develop his intellectual capacity.</i>

Verse 4

AND I WILL LAY MY HAND. That is, my blow, for a blow is struck with the hand. Scripture speaks anthropomorphically.
[MY HOSTS.] Its meaning is: as the angels are the Lord’s hosts in heaven so are Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord’s hosts, hence the term <i>My hosts</i>.</i> upon the earth.

Verse 5

SHALL KNOW. Rabbi Judah, the first grammarian, has already noted the difference between <i>ve-yade’u</i> (shall know) and <i>ve-yede’u</i> (shall know). The word <i>ve-yade’u</i>, which is vocalized with a long <i>kamatz</i>, is a verb in the perfect. Compare, <i>shame’u</i> (they heard).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yade’u</i> and <i>shame’u</i> are third person perfect forms.</i> The <i>vav</i> prefixed to <i>yade’u</i> changes it<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">From a perfect.</i> to an imperfect as per the grammatical rules.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For it is a conversive <i>vav</i>.</i> On the other hand, the <i>yod</i> of the word <i>ve-yede’u</i>, which is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew a <i>kamatz katan</i> which literally means a small <i>kamatz</i>.</i> is a future prefix. Compare, <i>ve-yishmeru</i> (they shall keep).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>yod</i> in <i>ve-yishmeru</i> (root, <i>shin, mem, resh</i>) is a future prefix. Similarly the <i>yod</i> of <i>ve-yede’u</i>.</i> The silent <i>yod</i> between the <i>yod</i> and the <i>dalet</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tzere</i> has the <i>yod</i> sound in it.</i> is in place of the root <i>yod</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-yede’u</i> comes from the root <i>yod, dalet, ayin</i>. Since the <i>yod</i> in <i>ve-yede’u</i> is a prefix the root <i>yod</i> is dropped. However, it is compensated by the <i>tzere</i>, which has the <i>yod</i> sound. Thus the word is sounded <i>ve-yede’u</i>, not <i>ve-yide’u</i> as it ordinarily would be. Compare, <i>ve-yishmeru, ve-yishme’u</i>, and <i>ve-yikhtivu.</i></i> Behold, God noted<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse.</i> why He brought the plagues upon the Egyptians. He brought them so that His glorious name would be known in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Not as a punishment for Pharaoh’s obstinacy. See I.E.’s comments on verse 3 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 6

AND MOSES AND AARON DID SO. Scripture now states generally that the signs<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Some were done by Moses and others by Aaron. See I.E. on Ex. 8:12.</i> were performed by Aaron and also by Moses. It then goes on to explain each one of the signs.

Verse 7

AND MOSES. The Pentateuch records the ages of Moses and Aaron. Aside from these two, we do not find in all of Scripture prophets concerning whom the Bible says that they prophesied in their old age.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.E., like Maimonides after him, apparently believed that a prophet has to be in perfect physical health in order to prophesy. “A person must satisfy the following conditions before he can become a prophet: The substance of the brain must…be in the most perfect condition…no part of his body must suffer from ill health” (Moses Maimonides, <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, Part II, chap. XXXVI, translated by M. Friedlander, 1904).</i> Their status was greater than that of all the other prophets, and to them alone did God speak in a pillar of cloud.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 99:7</i> Do not think that Samuel is to be included among them because it is written, <i>He spoke unto them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The previous verse speaks of Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. Thus <i>prima facie, unto them</i> refers to the latter three.</i><i>in the pillar of cloud</i> (Ps. 99:7), since I have already explained in its proper place that the Torah was given<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In a pillar of cloud. Cf. Ex. 24:18.</i> only to these two.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Moses and Aaron. Hence Ps. 99:7 does not apply to Samuel but only to Moses and Aaron. See I.E. on Gen. 20:17 and on Ps. 99:7.</i> Now, behold, through Moses and Aaron the righteous shall inherit the world to come, while all the other prophets are prophets who<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Merely.</i> rebuke or predict the future.

Verse 8

AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON. God now began to direct His words to the two of them. God knew that at first Pharaoh would not ask for a sign but would merely say, <i>I know not the Lord</i> (Ex. 5:2). However, now Pharaoh would ask for a sign.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">And both Moses and Aaron were involved in the bringing of miraculous signs.</i>

Verse 9

TAKE THY ROD. The reference is to Moses’ rod which Moses had given to Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For the purpose of striking the water. Hence Scripture refers to Moses’ rod as Aaron’s rod.</i> <i>Say unto Aaron: Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand</i> (v. 19); <i>and he lifted up the rod</i> (ba-matteh), <i>and smote the waters</i> (v. 20) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>thy rod</i> (Aaron’s rod) in our verse refers to the rod which Moses gave to Aaron.</i> Now by employing a <i>bet</i> that has a <i>pattach</i> beneath it<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20 reads <i>ba-matteh</i> (the rod). <i>Ba-matteh</i> is short for <i>be-ha-matteh.</i> This <i>heh ha-yedi’ah</i> (the definite article) indicates a well-known object, in this case a well-known rod. Only Moses’ rod fits this description.</i> Scripture is informing us that when He told him,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 19.</i> <i>Take thy rod</i>, He was referring to the well-known rod. <i>And thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go</i> (Ex. 17:5)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">God told this to Moses.</i> is additional proof of the above.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">That the rod was really Moses’ rod, as Moses never struck the Nile. Aaron did. However, since it was used to strike the water, it was as if Moses himself struck the water.</i>

Verse 10

AND MOSES AND AARON WENT IN. This too, namely, that the rod became a <i>tannin</i> (serpent), was a wonder.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">A supernatural act, contra those who try to give this act some sort of natural explanation. See I.E. on Ex. 4:2.</i> It was not like the wonder that he did for Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 4:3.</i> as there it only changed into a <i>nachash</i> (serpent).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse the reptile into which the rod changed is called a <i>tannin</i>. In Ex. 4:3 the rod is described as changing into a <i>nachash</i>.</i> However, Yefet says that <i>nachash</i> (serpent) and <i>tannin</i> (serpent) are one and the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the wonder done before Pharaoh and the one for Israel are more or less identical.</i>

Verse 11

THEN PHARAOH ALSO CALLED FOR THE WISE MEN. Astrologers.
AND THE SORCERERS. Those who appear to change natural law.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">They do not actually suspend natural law; they only appear to do so via trickery.</i>
THE MAGICIANS. Those who know the secrets of nature. <i>Chartumim</i> (magicians)<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: this word.</i> is a quadriliteral.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Most Hebrew words come from a triliteral root, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It might be an Egyptian or Chaldean word, as we do not find this word used in Scripture except when dealing with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">At the end of Genesis and here in Exodus in reference to the Egyptians and in the Book of Daniel with reference to the Chaldeans.</i> Scripture indicates a difference between what Moses did and what the magicians did. Moses really changed the staff into a serpent. As for the magicians, Scripture reads, <i>with their secret arts</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">That is, via chicanery.</i> <i>Be-lahatehem</i> (with their secret arts) comes from a triliteral root.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The printed editions read, <i>ve-hamillah ha-shelishit.</i> The <i>heh</i> should be dropped as it is the result of a scribal error. Indeed, <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 reads, <i>ve-hamillah shelishit</i>. Its root is <i>lamed, heh, tet</i>.</i> It is derived from the same root as <i>lahat</i> (flame) in <i>the flaming sword</i> (Gen. 3:24) and <i>lohatim</i> (them that are aflame) in <i>I do lie down among them that are aflame</i> (Ps. 57:5) and <i>lihat</i> (ablaze) in <i>And the day that cometh shall set them ablaze</i> (Mal. 3:19). It<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-latehem</i>.</i> refers to an illusion of lightning and passing fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The magicians made the rod appear to turn into a serpent in the same way that they have lightening and fire seem to appear.</i>

Verse 12

FOR THEY CAST DOWN. This, the swallowing of the magicians’ rods by Aaron’s staff and their consequent disappearance,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The magicians’ rods disappeared permanently.</i> was a second wonder.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The first being the turning of Aaron’s rod into a serpent.</i> Scripture refers to the staff as <i>Aaron’s rod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">At the time that it swallowed up the magicians’ rods it was a serpent. Hence Scripture should have referred to it as Aaron’s serpent rather than as Aaron’s rod.</i> for it was so at first. Rabbi Joshua says that Aaron’s rod swallowed the rods of the magicians after it returned to its original form.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">So too Rashi, hence the term <i>Aaron’s rod</i>.</i> And this was a great wonder.

Verse 13

AND PHARAOH’S HEART WAS HARDENED. By itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">God did not harden Pharaoh’s heart. Pharaoh hardened it himself.</i> Pharaoh saw that the magicians were able to do what Aaron did.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Change their rods into serpents.</i>

Verse 14

AND THE LORD SAID…PHARAOH’S HEART IS STUBBORN. <i>Kaved</i> (is stubborn) is a verb in the perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">This form is also used for the participle form, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is like the word <i>zaken</i> (was old) in <i>when Isaac was old</i> (Gen. 27:1), <i>chafetz</i> (were pleased) in <i>If the Lord were pleased</i> (Jud. 13:23), <i>ahev</i> (he loveth) in <i>such as he loveth</i> (Gen. 27:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">All these words are perfects. However, their forms are also those of participles.</i> The <i>mem</i> of <i>me’en</i> (refuseth), which is a root letter,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>me’en</i> is <i>mem, alef, nun</i>.</i> is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than a <i>chirik</i>.</i> so that a <i>dagesh</i> is not placed in the <i>alef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>alef</i> cannot take a <i>dagesh</i>.</i> which follows it.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Me’en</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>. The middle root letters of words in the <i>pi’el</i> have a <i>dagesh</i> in them, and their first root letter is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> in the perfect. Compare, <i>dibber, shibber</i>.</i> <i>Cheref</i> (jeoparded) in <i>jeoparded their lives</i> (Jud. 5:18) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">It too is a <i>pi’el</i>. Its <i>chet</i> is vocalized with a <i>tzere</i> in place of a <i>chirik</i> because its middle letter (a <i>resh</i>) cannot take a <i>dagesh</i>.</i>

Verse 15

GET THEE UNTO PHARAOH IN THE MORNING. It is the custom of the king of Egypt until this very day to go out in the months of Tamuz and Ab to see how high the water has risen. This is the time the river increases. God commanded Moses to go in the morning and stand before the river and perform the sign of the striking of the river in the presence of Pharaoh. He commanded Moses to take and then give to Aaron the rod which he had turned into a serpent before coming unto Pharaoh (Ex. 4:3) and to wave it over the waters of Egypt so that Pharaoh would see with his very eyes the river turn into blood at the moment that Aaron struck it.

Verse 16

AND THOU SHALT SAY UNTO HIM. Say the following to him, because if he does not listen, this is the first plague. The rod which turned into a serpent (v. 10) was not a plague.

Verse 17

THUS SAITH THE LORD. The messenger speaks the word of the one who sent him.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Moses said, <i>In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord</i>. However, as Moses is not the Lord, Moses should rather have said: In this thou shalt know that He is the Lord. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Moses was brief, for the term “His messenger” has been omitted. The statement should be understood thus: <i>behold, I</i> His messenger<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">What Moses meant was: Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I am His messenger, in this thou shalt know, etc.</i> <i>will smite with the rod that is in my hand</i>.
[WITH THE ROD THAT IS IN MY HAND.] Moses said, <i>that is in my hand</i>, even though the rod was in Aaron’s hand because they were equals<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">If they were not equals then the sign would have been attributed to the more important one even though both participated in the performance of the sign.</i> and both participated in the performance of the sign.

Verse 18

AND THE FISH. <i>Fish</i> is a general term for all things that swarm in the waters.
SHALL LOATHE. <i>Ve-nil’u</i> (shall loathe) is a <i>nifal</i> from the same root as the word <i>la’ah</i> (weary).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>lamed, alef, heh</i>.</i> Its meaning is, will be unable.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>lo yukhelu</i> as <i>Vat.

The <i>vav</i> changes it to an imperfect; hence <i>ve-nil’u</i> means will be unable.</i>

Verse 19

AND THE LORD SAID. According to my opinion this is to be understood as follows. Aaron waved his hand and struck the Nile. He also waved his hand toward all the sides of Egypt to turn the waters of all the rivers in the land of Egypt, that is, in the kingdom of Egypt, into blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse notes that Aaron was commanded to stretch his hand over the waters of Egypt. It does not state that the Nile was struck. However, the next verse states that Aaron struck the Nile but omits the fact that he stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt. I.E. held that the verses teach that Aaron was commanded to do two things: to strike the Nile (v. 20), and to stretch his hands over all the rivers of Egypt (Filwarg).</i> The term <i>the waters of Egypt</i> is a general term. <i>Over their rivers</i> is one of its particulars. The term <i>ye’or</i> (stream)<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">So J.P.S. However, the next verse renders <i>ye’or</i> as river.

There are other rivers in Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the Bible speaks of <i>naharotam</i> (their rivers).</i> for the blood was over all of their country.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">While the Nile runs only through the middle of the country.</i>
OVER THEIR STREAMS. The plural <i>ye’orehem</i> (their streams)<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">So J.P.S. According to I.E., their rivers.</i> is employed<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">There is only one Nile (<i>ye’or</i>) in Egypt. Why then is the plural <i>ye’orehem</i> employed?</i> because the Nile is found in many places.
THEIR POOLS. Pools of rainwater that form by themselves.
AND OVER THEIR PONDS OF WATER. This refers to fountains, wells, and cisterns. Saadiah Gaon says that the word <i>meyeme</i> (water of),<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s comment pertains to the word <i>meyemehem</i> (of their water).</i> which is the word <i>me</i> (water of) doubled, refers to sweet water while the word <i>me</i> refers to bitter water, as in <i>me ha-yam</i> (waters of the sea). Scripture therefore reads, <i>ha-kore le-me ha-yam</i> (that calleth for the waters of the sea) (Amos 5:8). Now the Gaon forgot that Scripture states, <i>me ha-yarden yikkaretun</i> (the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off) (Josh. 3:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The Jordan’s waters are sweet. We thus see that <i>me</i> refers also to sweet water.</i> The word <i>me</i> is always doubled when connected to a pronoun, as in the word <i>memai</i> (my water) (I Sam. 25:11) and in <i>memekha</i> (thy water) (Ezek. 12:18). This mode comes exclusively in the plural form,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Even when it refers to the singular, the plural is used.</i> as it is incorrect to say <i>memi</i> (my water) and <i>memah</i> (her water).<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">We rather say <i>meyemai and meyemeha.</i></i> We find me<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">But never the double form <i>meme.</i></i> used in the singular in <i>because the water of</i> (me) <i>sprinkling was not dashed</i> (Num. 19:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The verb governing <i>zorak</i> (dashed) is singular. Hence <i>me</i> too is in the singular.</i>
[BOTH IN VESSELS OF WOOD AND IN VESSELS OF STONE.] That is, in water found in the homes in vessels made out of wood or basins made out of stone.

Verse 20

AND MOSES AND AARON DID. Scripture notes the smiting of the Nile. However, it does not bother to mention the waving of the hand over all the waters of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">See note 77.</i>

Verse 21



Verse 22

AND THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT DID IN LIKE MANNER WITH THEIR SECRET ARTS. The word <i>be-latehem</i> (with their secret arts) comes from the same root as <i>ba-lat</i> (stealthily)<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>lamed, vav, tet</i>, meaning to envelop, to cover, i.e., to do something secretly. I.E.’s point is that <i>be-latehem</i> is not to be confused with <i>be-lahatehem</i> in verse 11.</i> in <i>she approached him stealthily</i> (Jud. 4:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">New J.P.S. translation.</i> It means with secret things hidden from the eye. A <i>heh</i> has not been omitted from the word,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">In which case its root would be <i>lamed, heh, tet</i>, for the <i>heh</i> would be implied in the <i>pattach</i> sound and <i>be-lahtehem</i> would thus be a variant of <i>be-lahatehem</i> in verse 11.</i> for the <i>heh</i> is not an implied letter in the middle of a word.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">It is only an implied letter at the end of a word. For the meaning of an implied letter see the notes to I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</i> One may ask: If all the water in Egypt was turned into blood by Aaron, where did the magicians find the water to turn into blood? The answer is: Aaron turned only water that is found above ground into blood. He did not transform any water that was below ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The Egyptians dug for water to drink. See verse 24.</i> The magicians dug and brought forth water from beneath the ground and openly turned it into blood. Now, there is a great difference between what Aaron did and what the magicians brought about. Aaron transformed all of the Nile that was before him plus all the water that was in all the borders of Egypt, which he did not see.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Into blood. The point is that Aaron transformed both the water that he saw (the Nile) and the water which he did not see into blood.</i> Furthermore, he changed water that was not standing still but was continually running, with other water taking its place, into blood. Additionally, the plague lasted for seven days. The magicians, on the other hand, were only able to transform a little water standing in a vessel, for a moment, until Pharaoh returned to his house.

Verse 23

AND PHARAOH TURNED. Scripture states <i>even this</i><sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie, even this</i> seems out of place, for this was the first plague.</i> because it first mentioned the sign of the rod which turned into a serpent and swallowed the other rods.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Which did not convince Pharaoh to set Israel free. Hence Scripture states, <i>even this</i>.</i>

Verse 24

DIGGED. Many say that the water was as red as blood in the hands of an Egyptian and became clear in the hands of an Israelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the plague of blood did not affect the Israelites. The very same water that was red in the hands of an Egyptian turned normal in the hands of an Israelite and vice versa. Cf. <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 9:9.</i> If this is so then why doesn’t the Torah record this sign? I believe that the plagues of blood, frogs, and gnats<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Or lice.</i> included both Egyptians and Hebrews, for we shall follow Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than the <i>aggadah</i>. Since Scripture does not indicate that these plagues did not affect the Israelites, we do not assume the contrary.</i> These three plagues caused little harm. However, God differentiated between the Egyptians and the Israelites with regard to the swarms,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Of wild beasts. This is explicitly stated in 8.18.</i> which was a very harmful plague. So too with regard to the plagues of murrain<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ex. 9:4.</i> and hail<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ex. 9:26.</i> because of their flocks.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">So that none of the flocks of Israel be diminished.</i> This was not the case with the boils and locusts,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">They too befell Israel.</i> for they<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites (Krinsky).</i> left<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Soon left Egypt.</i> Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">And left their fields behind.

We must assume this, as the plague of blood struck them as well.</i>

Verse 25

WERE FULFILLED. Scripture notes this because unlike the other plagues, this plague lasted many days.

Verse 26

AND THE LORD SPOKE…GO IN UNTO PHARAOH. With your brother Aaron and inform him of the second plague if he does not let my people go.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on verse 2.</i>

Verse 27

AND IF. The word <i>ma’en</i> (refuse) is a transitive<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">This form is also used for intransitive verbs, i.e., <i>ayef</i> (tired), hence I.E.’s comment.</i> participle.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a transitive adjective. I.E. refers to the present form as an adjective. I.E.’s point is that even though <i>ma’en</i> is ordinarily an infinitive, here it is used as an adjective. The normal participle form for this word in <i>pi’el</i> is <i>me-ma’en</i>.</i> It is like the word <i>ve-shabbe’ach</i> (wherefore I praised)<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbe’ach</i> is a participle even though this form of the word is ordinarily an infinitive. The normal participle form of this word in the <i>pi’el</i> is <i>me-shabbe’ach</i>.</i> in <i>Wherefore I praised the dead</i> (Eccles. 4:2). The meaning of <i>nogef</i> (smite) is destroy. It is thus written, <i>And frogs, which destroyed them</i> (Ps. 78:45). The commentaries are divided as to the meaning of the word <i>tzefarde’im</i> (frogs). Many say that it is a type of fish called <i>al-timsach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">The crocodile.</i> in Arabic that is found in Egypt, that arises from the river and preys upon people. Others say that it is the well-known sound-producing creature which is found in the majority of rivers.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">The frog.</i> This interpretation appears to me to be correct.

Verse 28

AND THE RIVER SHALL SWARM. <i>Ve-sharatz</i> (shall swarm) is a transitive<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">This verb can be transitive or intransitive, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> verb.

See I.E. on Gen. 1:20 and the notes thereto.</i> in <i>Let the waters swarm</i> (Gen. 1:20).
[WHICH SHALL GO UP.] The reason Scripture states this is that the river is always lower than the city.

Verse 29

BOTH UPON THEE, AND UPON THY PEOPLE. Yefet says that Scripture reads, <i>both upon thee, and upon thy people</i> to hint that the frogs shall affect only Pharaoh and his people but not Israel. However, this is no proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. held that the plague of frogs also affected the Israelites.

Towards the four corners of heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The passage is to be interpreted, stretch forth thy rod with thy hand towards heaven so that a plague will descend upon the rivers, canals, and pools.

However, they will not arise from all gatherings of water.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the plague of blood, which struck all gatherings of water (Ex. 7:19), the plague of frogs was limited to rivers, pools, and canals.</i>

AND THE MAGICIANS DID IN LIKE MANNER. In the little water.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which they brought. The magicians could only bring forth frogs from the pans of water which they brought before Pharaoh, whereas Aaron caused frogs to swarm in all of the canals, pools, and rivers.</i> Pharaoh therefore saw that there was a difference between what Aaron did and what his magicians were able to do. He called Moses because he saw that his magicians could add to the plague<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They could bring forth additional frogs from the water they brought but could not do anything to remove the frogs from the rivers, streams, and canals.</i> but were unable to mitigate it.

Verse 4

THEN PHARAOH CALLED. Pharaoh employed the plural form for entreat (<i>hatiru</i>) out of respect for Moses and Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh knew that it was Moses who would pray to God to have the frogs removed. He used the plural and thereby included Aaron in his plea, out of deference to Aaron.</i> This plague was worse than the first one, for we read, <i>He sent among them…frogs, which destroyed them</i> (Ps. 78:45).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms does not say the same with regard to the plague of blood. It states, <i>And turned their rivers into blood, So that they could not drink their streams</i> (Ps. 78:44). It does not say that the plague of blood destroyed them.</i>

Verse 5

AND MOSES SAID UNTO PHARAOH: HAVE THOU THIS GLORY OVER ME. I will glorify you by entreating the Lord that He take away the plague on a day that you yourself shall designate.
[AND REMAIN IN THE RIVER ONLY.] The reason for mentioning the river is that this is where the frogs started from. Once Scripture notes <i>the river</i> there is no need to mention the canals and pools.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The point of our verse is that the frogs remained in their natural habitat. <i>The river</i> is mentioned merely as an example of the aforementioned.</i>

Verse 6

AND HE SAID: AGAINST TOMORROW. Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See chapter 4, note 135.</i> says that people usually pray that a plague be removed from them immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. was troubled by Pharaoh requesting that the plague be removed on the next day, hence this comment.</i> Pharaoh, however, thought that the plague of frogs resulted from an unpropitious conjunction of heavenly bodies which Moses knew about.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">And exploited for his benefit. Pharaoh did not believe that Moses had brought the plague. He thought that it was a natural occurrence.</i> He thought that the time for the removal of the frogs had now come.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">On the day that he spoke to Moses.</i> Therefore Pharaoh tested Moses by asking him to extend the plague and said, <i>Against tomorrow</i>.

Verse 7

AND THE FROGS SHALL DEPART. <i>Ve-saru</i> (shall depart) is ultimately accented, contrary to the rules of grammar.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rules of Hebrew grammar it should have been penultimately accented.</i> We find the same irregularity in the word <i>samu</i> (they put) in <i>that they should put me into the dungeon</i> (Gen. 40:15).

Verse 8

AND MOSES AND AARON WENT OUT. <i>Moses cried unto the Lord</i> because he trusted that the Lord would not put him to shame. Out of his own accord and without the permission of God, he had told Pharaoh, <i>Be it according to thy word</i>.

Verse 9

AND THE LORD DID ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES. Which he had spoken of his own accord.

Verse 10

AND THEY GATHERED. <i>Va-yitzberu</i> (and they gathered) is similar in meaning to the word <i>va-yitzbor</i> (laid up) in <i>And Joseph laid up corn</i> (Gen. 41:49).
HEAPS. <i>Chomarim chomarim</i> (heaps) is similar in meaning to <i>chamor chamoratayim</i> (heaps upon heaps) (Jud. 15:16).

Verse 11

BUT WHEN PHARAOH SAW THAT THERE WAS RESPITE. The word <i>harevachah</i> (respite) is similar in meaning to <i>ve-ravach</i> (relief) in <i>so Saul found relief</i> (Jud. 16:23).
HE HARDENED HIS HEART. Scripture employs an infinitive (<i>hakhbed</i>) in place of a perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In view of the fact that our verse deals with the past, Scripture should read <i>hikhbid</i> (he hardened) rather than <i>hakhbed</i> (to harden), as the former is a perfect and the latter an infinitive. I.E. points out that Scripture occasionally uses an infinitive with the meaning of a perfect. As to the question of free will, see I.E. on Ex. 7:3.</i>

Verse 12

AND THE LORD SAID. Note that the first three plagues and signs which Aaron brought about pertained to the lowest elements,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For the four elements, see Vol. 1, p. 74, note 53.</i> as I have explained previously, since two were related to water and one to the dust of the earth. However, the plagues brought about by Moses with his rod related to a higher element. This was so because Moses was on a higher plane than Aaron. Thus the hail and the locusts were brought by the wind, and the darkness was in the air.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Air (wind) was believed to be a higher element.</i> Moses also brought about the plague of boils.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It was Moses who threw the soot of the furnace heavenward and caused boils to break out upon man and beast. See Ex. 9:10. This plague entailed the element of air.</i> However, three plagues came about without the use of the rod, namely, the swarms of beasts, murrain, and the death of the first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">These three plagues did not entail any interaction with any of the elements. Thus Aaron brought three plagues via the rod, i.e., blood, frogs, and gnats. Moses similarly brought three plagues via the use of the rod, i.e., hail, locusts, and darkness. One plague was brought jointly by Moses and Aaron without the use of the rod, i.e., the plague of boils. Three other plagues came about without any action by Moses and Aaron, i.e., the swarms of beasts, (J.P.S. renders swarms of flies), murrain, and the death of the first-born.</i> One plague, that of the boils, was brought about by Moses with Aaron’s minor participation and without the use of the rod.
[THAT IT MAY BECOME GNATS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT.] This is similar in meaning to <i>And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt</i> (Ex. 9:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>lamed</i> prefixed to <i>kinnim</i> does not mean to, but for, i.e.; <i>le-kinnim</i> does not mean to gnats but for gnats, that is, so that gnats will result. Similarly, <i>le-afar</i> does not mean to dust but for dust, i.e., so that dust will result. I.E. comments thus because the <i>lamed</i> usually has the meaning of to.</i> The dust which Aaron struck gave birth, as it were, to gnats which went up over all the land of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse does not teach that the dust literally turned into gnats. It only seemed so.</i>

Verse 13

AND THEY DID SO. <i>And they did</i> refers to Moses and Aaron. Moses is included because he told Aaron to smite the dust with the rod. Our verse is similar to <i>and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand</i> (Ex. 17:5).
AND THERE WERE GNATS. <i>Kinnam</i> (gnats) is a generic name.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>kinnam</i> presents a problem. The Hebrew word for gnat is <i>kinnah</i>; for gnats, <i>kinnim</i>. Hence our verse should have read <i>kinnim</i> or <i>kinnah</i> if a collective noun were employed.</i> The <i>mem</i> of <i>kinnam</i> is either superfluous or in place of a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. suggests that our verse employs a collective noun and that the word for gnat is <i>ken</i> (a variant of <i>kinnah</i>), the <i>mem</i> in <i>kinnam</i> being superfluous. He then suggests that the word for gnat is <i>kinnah</i>, with a <i>mem</i> substituted for a <i>heh</i>.</i> In any case, it is not a root letter. The <i>mem</i> sometimes serves as the sign of the feminine plural, as in the word <i>tzefardi’im</i> (frogs). This term is a feminine, for when referring to the singular Scripture reads, <i>va-ta’al ha-tzefarde’a</i> (and the frog came up) (Ex. 8:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-ta’al</i> (came up) is a feminine verb. Thus <i>tzefarde’a</i> (frog), the noun which it governs, must also be feminine. Hence <i>tzefardi’im</i> (frogs) is a feminine plural. I.E. makes note of this because a <i>mem</i> suffixed to a noun usually indicates that a word is a masculine plural.</i> The term <i>kinnim</i> is proof of the aforementioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">That the <i>mem</i> of kinnam is not a root letter, for the plural of <i>kinnah</i>. is <i>kinnim</i>, not <i>kinnamim</i></i> According to this interpretation the word <i>ha-kinnam</i> is irregular because of its superfluous <i>mem</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">For the usual word for gnat is <i>kinnah</i>.</i> It is similar to the word <i>rekam</i> (empty) and <i>chinnam</i> (gratuitous).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. 1, p. 306.</i> However, Yefet says that the <i>mem</i> of <i>kinnam</i> is a pronominal suffix relating to the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>kinnam</i> (gnats) means their gnats, for <i>kinnam</i> is a combination of the noun <i>ken</i> (gnat) and the pronoun <i>she-lahem</i> (their).</i> He claims that the singular of <i>kinnim</i> (gnats) is <i>kan</i>, in the same way that the singular of <i>pittim</i> (morsels) is <i>pat</i> (morsel). He also says that the word <i>ha-kinnam</i> is similar to the word <i>ha-oholi</i> (my tent) (Josh. 7:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Words that result from the combination of a noun and a pronoun do not usually have the definite article (<i>ha</i>) prefixed to it. Thus <i>prima facie, ha-kinnam</i> cannot mean their gnats. Hence Yefet points out that we occasionally do find the definite article prefixed to a noun combined with a pronoun, as in the word <i>ha-oholi</i>.</i> Do not be amazed that Scripture records that after one spot was struck, <i>all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumes that this would strain some people’s credulity.</i> Its meaning is that the plague then started.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>all the dust of the earth</i> did not turn to gnats the moment Aaron struck the earth.</i> The same is true regarding the plagues of the water<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">All the rivers, streams, pools, and ponds of Egypt did not turn into blood the moment Aaron <i>smote the waters that were in the river</i> (Ex. 7:20).</i> and the boils.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The boils did not break out upon all men and beasts the moment Moses threw the soot heavenward.</i>

Verse 14

AND THE MAGICIANS DID SO. They struck the dust of the earth.
TO BRING FORTH GNATS. To cause the earth to bring forth gnats as Aaron did. However, they could not do so.
[AND THERE WERE GNATS UPON MAN, AND UPON BEAST.] Scripture notes this a second time because the plague was also upon the magicians.

Verse 15

THEN THE MAGICIANS SAID. When the magicians saw that unlike the changing of the rod into a serpent and the plague of blood and frogs where they were able to duplicate Aaron’s actions they were now unable to imitate what Aaron had done, they said to Pharaoh that this plague did not come to liberate Israel but was a disaster sent by God in keeping with the arrangements of the stars dealing with Egypt’s fortune. I have previously explained that Pharaoh did not deny the existence of a Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 5:2.</i> He only denied the existence of the God which Moses revealed to him. Our verse is explained by, <i>it is not His hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us</i> (I Sam. 6:9) from heaven. Hence Pharaoh’s heart was hardened. Our interpretation is supported by the fact that the magicians said, <i>This is the finger of God</i>, and not, this is the finger of the Lord, meaning the God of Israel, as Pharaoh did when he exclaimed, <i>Entreat the Lord</i>, with regard to the plague of frogs and then similarly used this term for God in the latter plagues.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">When Pharaoh finally acknowledged that the plagues were sent by the God of Israel, he used the term Lord (<i>Adonai</i>) rather than <i>Elohim</i> (God) for the Deity. <i>Adonai</i> is the Lord’s proper name. <i>Elohim</i> is a generic name and in the Bible often refers to idols.</i> Furthermore, Moses told Pharaoh that the Nile would be stricken before it was actually plagued, and he likewise informed him that the land would be inundated by frogs before they appeared. However, Moses did not inform Pharaoh that a plague of gnats was about to strike.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the magicians could argue that the gnats were not sent by the Lord.</i>

Verse 16

AND THE LORD SAID. It is the custom of kings to go out to the river in the morning, for it is good for the eyes to see water.

Verse 17

I WILL SEND. The word <i>mashli’ach</i> (I will send) is in the <i>hifil</i>. It is irregular.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The usual term for I will send, as used in our verse, is <i>meshale’ach</i> in the <i>pi’el</i>.</i>
[SWARMS OF FLIES.] The word <i>arov</i> (swarms of flies) refers to a mixture of evil beasts such as lions, wolves, bears, and leopards.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>arov</i>, translated by J.P.S. as swarms of flies, comes from the root <i>ayin, resh, bet</i>, meaning to mingle. According to I.E. it means a mixture of wild animals.</i>
[AND ALSO THE GROUND.] Uninhabited places.

Verse 18

AND I WILL SET APART. Some say that the word <i>ve-hifleti</i> (and I will set apart) is missing an <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>peh, lamed, alef</i>. There is no <i>alef</i> in <i>ve-hifleti</i>, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> However, I believe that it comes from a root ending in a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>peh, lamed, heh.</i> Hence there is no <i>alef</i> in <i>ve-hifleti</i>.</i> The meaning of <i>ve-hifleti</i> is, and I will set apart. It is logical to assume that Pharaoh now started to lighten Israel’s burden. When he saw that the Lord put a division between Israel and Egypt he feared to harm them. He now saw the need to send them to offer sacrifices to the Lord, <i>lest he fall upon us with pestilence</i> (Ex. 5:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lest he fall upon us with pestilence</i> was first uttered by the Israelites. However, it also referred to Pharaoh. See I.E.’s comment on Ex. 5:3.</i> Don’t you see that he now gave them permission to sacrifice to the Lord in the land of Egypt?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that Pharaoh now started to make concessions.</i>
[THAT I AM THE LORD IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH.] This is a metaphor. It is the manner of kings to establish their residences in the middle of their kingdoms so as to be equidistant to their borders. The Lord similarly placed the heart, which is “king” over man’s body, in the center of the human corporeal frame. Man’s spirit too is located in the center of the body, as it is written, <i>And (the Lord) formed the spirit of man in the midst of him</i> (Zech. 12:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. believed that man’s soul is located in the heart, which is in the center of the body. He held that Zech. 12:1 supports this contention.</i> There are many proofs from nature that this is so. Scripture states, <i>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth</i> (Ps. 50:2) because Zion is in the center of the inhabited world and God’s presence is seen in the inhabited world.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:1.</i>

Verse 19

AND I WILL PUT A DIVISION. The meaning of <i>pedut</i> is a division. The word <i>pidyon</i> (redemption) is always similar in meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">To be redeemed means to be separated from ones enemies. Both <i>pedut</i> and <i>pidyon</i> come from the root <i>peh, dalet, heh</i>.</i>

Verse 20

AND THE LORD DID SO. On the morrow, as Moses had spoken.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumes that the swarms came the day after Moses had warned Pharaoh of their coming. They did not come immediately because God wanted to give Pharaoh a chance to repent (Krinsky).</i>
[AND THERE CAME GRIEVOUS SWARMS.] By themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Moses threatened <i>a swarm</i> of beasts (or flies). The Pentateuch tells us that <i>a grievous swarm</i> came. Hence I.E. notes that the grievous swarm came of itself; i.e., it was worse than what Moses threatened (Krinsky). That is, they were more numerous and/or more harmful.</i> This plague was worse than any of the previous plagues.

Verse 21

AND PHARAOH CALLED. It was now clear to Pharaoh that the plagues came because the children of Israel did not offer sacrifices unto the Lord.
[IN THE LAND.] In his kingdom and not in any other place.

Verse 22

AND MOSES SAID. Rabbi Joshua says that the clause <i>the abomination of the Egyptians</i> was written to disparage idol worship. What Moses actually said to Pharaoh was, “the god of the Egyptians.” Rabbi Joshua further states that the god of Egypt was shaped like a lamb because the Egyptians believed that the constellation of the lamb ruled over their land. It is because of this that the Egyptians did not eat meat. However, if the reason for the Egyptians not eating meat was their worship of the lamb why did they also abstain from ox and goat meat? I believe that the ancient Egyptians in the time of Moses had the same belief currently held by the people of India, who make up more than half of the world. All of them are descendants of Ham.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">As are the Egyptians.</i> They do not eat meat until this very day. These people also do not drink milk or blood or eat fish or eggs. In other words, they do not eat anything coming from a living creature. Furthermore, they abhor any person who eats any of the aforementioned. They consider shepherding to be an especially disgusting type of work. It is similarly written, <i>for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians</i> (Gen. 47:34). They also do not allow any meat-eating person in their country. If any of them goes to a foreign country he will flee from any place where flesh is eaten. They will not eat anything which a meat-eater has handled. They consider his very garments unclean. It is thus written, <i>because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews</i> (Gen. 43:32). Behold, Potiphar placed everything with the exception of the food which he ate under the care of Joseph, who was then living in his house. Potiphar would not permit him to touch his food because Joseph was a Hebrew. There is no reason to ask, “If this is so, then why did the Egyptians keep cattle?”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Pentateuch tells us that the Egyptians kept cattle. See Ex. 9:3 and many other verses in this chapter which relate the same.</i> We find the same to be the case in contemporary India. Horses, asses, and camels were used to carry burdens and for riding. Cattle served to pull the plow and sheep were kept for their wool. I will yet speak on this when I discuss the Passover observed in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 12:7.</i> Yefet says that an interrogative <i>heh</i> is missing in the phrase <i>ve-lo yiskelunu</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-lo yiskelunu</i> (will they not stone us) literally means: and they will not stone us. For the clause to mean “(and) will they not stone us” it should read: <i>ve-ha-lo yiskelunu</i>; i e., an interrogative <i>heh</i> should be placed before the word <i>lo</i>.</i> for its meaning is, will they not stone us.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The context implies that it is to be so translated.</i> However, I believe that the word <i>hen</i> (lo) in <i>hen nizbach</i> (lo, we sacrifice)<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hence there is no need to place an interrogative <i>heh</i> before the word <i>hen</i> (lo). J.P.S. translates: lo, if we sacrifice.</i> has the same meaning as the interrogative <i>heh.</i> The meaning of our verse thus is: if we sacrifice (<i>hen nizbach</i>) the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us? The word <i>hen</i> in <i>hen hayetah ka-zot</i> (if there hath been such a thing) (Jer. 2:10) is identical.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">There too <i>hen</i> is in place of the interrogative <i>heh</i>, for the meaning of <i>hen hayetah</i> is: if there had been, not lo, there had been. The word <i>hen</i> can mean lo, behold, or if.</i>

Verse 23

WE WILL GO THREE DAYS’ JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS. We must remove ourselves from the Egyptians.
[AS HE SHALL COMMAND US.] Regarding the type and number of animals to be selected as sacrificial victims.

Verse 24

AND PHARAOH SAID. The phrase <i>entreat for me</i> should have been placed at the beginning of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than at the end of the verse.</i> as the verse means entreat for me that this plague will be removed and I will let you go to sacrifice in the wilderness as you asked. However, this is on the condition that you go no further than three days’ journey into the desert.

Verse 25

AND MOSES SAID…ONLY LET NOT PHARAOH DEAL DECEITFULLY. The word <i>hetel</i> (deal deceitfully) is irregular. A <i>dagesh</i> should have been placed in the <i>tav</i>, for its <i>heh</i> is a root letter. It should have been vocalized like the word <i>dabber</i> (speak) in <i>behold, I cannot speak</i> (Jer. 1:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>hetel</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>. Hence it should follow the paradigm of <i>dabber</i>, which is a <i>pi’el</i> and should be vocalized <i>hattel</i>. Since the word is not so vocalized it is irregular.</i> We find the same irregularity in <i>hatel tehatellu vo</i> (mock, will ye mock him) (Job 13:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. has abridged the clause. Job 13:9 reads: <i>Or as one mocketh a man, will ye mock Him</i>? Cf. Krinsky.</i> The correct vocalization of this word is found in the clause <i>va-yehattel ba-hem eliyahu</i> (that Elijah mocked them) (I Kings 18:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The word is there vocalized in the usual <i>pi’el</i> form <i>va-yehattel</i>. Compare, <i>va-yedabber</i>.</i> Moses said, <i>only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more</i>, because he had promised to let the people go during the plague of the frogs and then didn’t.

Verse 26

AND MOSES WENT OUT. There are words in Hebrew that have the same meaning in the <i>kal</i> and <i>hifil.</i> These words come in two forms with one meaning. Examples are: <i>va-yetar</i> (and entreated) in <i>and entreated the Lord</i> and <i>ve-hatarti</i> (and I will entreat) in <i>and I will entreat the Lord</i> (v. 25).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The same root in a variant conjugation usually has a different though related meaning, hence I.E.’s comment. <i>Va-yetar</i> is a <i>kal; ve-hatarti</i> is a <i>hifil</i>.</i> Similarly <i>moreh</i> (shoot) and <i>yarah</i> (shot) in <i>which I shoot</i> and <i>he shot an arrow</i> (I Sam. 20:36).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Moreh</i> is a <i>hifil</i>. <i>Yarah</i> is a <i>kal</i>.</i> However, such words are rare.

Verse 27

AND THE LORD DID. The word <i>va-yasar</i> (and he removed) is grammatically irregular. Roots having a <i>vav</i> as their middle letter<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>va-yasar</i> is <i>samekh, vav, resh</i>.</i> are vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath their first stem letter, i.e., <i>va-yashav</i> (and he returned)<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>va-yashav</i> is <i>shin, vav, bet</i>.</i> and <i>va-yakam</i> (and he got up).<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>va-yakam</i> is <i>kof, vav, mem</i>.</i> However, in cases where the last letter of the root cannot receive a <i>dagesh</i>, i.e., if it is a <i>chet, ayin</i>, or <i>resh</i>, then the first root letter is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than a <i>kamatz</i>.</i> as in <i>va-yanach</i> (and rested)<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, vav, chet</i>.</i> in <i>and rested on the seventh day</i> (Ex. 20:11); <i>va-yana</i> (was moved)<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>nun, vav, ayin</i>.</i> in <i>and his heart was moved</i> (Is. 7:2); <i>va-yasar</i> (and he turned) in <i>And he turned in unto her</i> (Jud. 4:18). All of the aforementioned applies to words in the <i>kal</i>, because in the <i>hifil</i> roots having a <i>vav</i> as their middle letter are vocalized with a <i>segol</i> beneath their first stem letters in cases where their roots do not end in the letters mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>chet, ayin</i>, or <i>resh</i>.</i> An example of the aforementioned is <i>va-yashev</i> (and he brought back) in <i>And he brought back all the goods</i> (Gen. 14:16). Now <i>and he removed</i> is written <i>va-yasar</i> rather than <i>va-yaser</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it is a <i>hifil</i>. It is so written because its final root letter is a <i>resh.</i> Thus the <i>hifil</i> and the <i>kal</i> of this root are spelled in the same way, hence the grammatical irregularity of this root.</i> It is like <i>va-yasar</i> (and he took off) in <i>And he took off their chariot wheels</i> (Ex. 14:25). However, it appears that <i>va-yasar</i> is a <i>kal</i> and that <i>va-yasar he-arov</i> (and He removed the swarms of flies) means: and the swarms of flies departed.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">If we take <i>va-yasar</i> to be a <i>hifil</i> its meaning is, and he removed. If we interpret it as a <i>kal</i> its meaning is, and he (it) departed.</i>

Verse 28

AND PHARAOH HARDENED HIS HEART. He hardened his heart as he did at the plague of the frogs wherein it is written: <i>he hardened his heart</i> (v. 11).

Chapter 9



Verse 1

GO IN UNTO PHARAOH. To his palace. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi says that two plagues were in the water: one, that it turned red and the fish died; two, that frogs arose from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The first two plagues came about through Egypt’s waters.</i> Two plagues were on the earth:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The next two plagues came about via the earth.</i> one of gnats and the second the swarms, which were an assortment of wild animals. And it is written, <i>Let the earth bring forth the living creature</i> (Gen. 1:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The plague of wild animals can thus be considered as a plague from the ground.</i> There were likewise two plagues in the air.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The next two plagues came about through the air.</i> Murrain<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Or pestilence.

This change causes an untold number to die in an instant, as the spirit of life which resides in the heart depends on the air.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 2:7.</i> The second plague<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To strike through the air.</i> was the boils. Scripture refers to the firmament which is above their heads as the heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">When Scripture states, <i>Take to you handfuls of soot…and let Moses throw it heavenward</i> (Ex. 9:10) it means “and let Moses throw it up to the air,” as the air above is called the firmament. See I.E. on Gen. 1:6 where he writes, “The firmament is the air.”</i> The seventh plague<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The plague of hail.</i> was a mixture of the sphere of the whirlwind<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A layer of wind surrounding the earth.</i> and the sphere of fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A layer of fire surrounding the earth. Medieval man believed in four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. I.E. explains that all the earthly elements plus some heavenly elements were involved in bringing about the plagues. That is, two blows came from the water, two from the earth, two from the air, one from a combination of air and fire, two more from the air (locusts and darkness), and one from the heavens. Earth is the heaviest element. We therefore would imagine that it would be the first element involved in the plague. However, I.E. notes in Gen. 1:6 that it is the nature of water to be below the earth. Hence the first plague came from the waters, and succeeding plagues moved upward to the heavens.</i> It is thus written, <i>and fire flashing up amidst the hail</i> (v. 24). The eighth was the plague of locusts which the wind brought from afar. The ninth was a wonderful plague in that the light from the two great luminaries and the stars was absent from above the land of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This too came about from the air, in that the air was clouded (Krinsky). See I.E on Ex. 10:22.</i> The tenth was the descent of the destroyer from the spheres of the glory<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>galgale ha-kavod</i>. I.E. refers to a large shining star as a <i>kavod</i> (a glory). See Y. Klatzkin, <i>Otzar Ha-Munachim Ha-Filosfim</i>, Vol. II, Berlin, 1928, p. 62.</i> to kill the first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently believes that an evil conjugation of the stars caused the first-born to die.</i>

Verse 2

AND WILL HOLD THEM STILL. The word hand or something similar<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps teeth (Weiser).</i> has been omitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>machazik</i> (hold them) is a <i>hifil</i>, a causative. It literally means causes to hold. Hence, whenever this form is encountered, the word hand or something similar is implied although not always stated. Our phrase literally reads: and will still cause to hold them. I.E. interprets this to mean: and will still cause your hand (or something similar) to hold them (Filwarg).</i> <i>One that holdeth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>machazik</i>. J.P.S. translates as <i>taketh</i>.</i> <i>a dog by the ears</i> (Prov. 26:17) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This too should be read as: one that causeth his hand to hold a dog by the ears. It literally reads: one that causeth to hold a dog by the ears.</i>

Verse 3

BEHOLD, THE HAND OF THE LORD IS UPON. Observe, we find that a <i>yod</i> interchanges with a <i>vav</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse, in the word <i>hoyah</i> (is).</i> as elsewhere we read, <i>and thou wouldest be</i> (hoveh) <i>their king</i> (Neh. 6:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hoveh</i> is the usual form. Hence in <i>hoyah</i> a <i>yod</i> has been interchanged with a <i>vav</i>.</i> The opposite is the case with the <i>vav</i> of <i>kovai</i> (that wait for me)<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>kof, vav, heh</i>.</i> in <i>For they shall not be ashamed that wait for Me</i> (Is. 49:23) which interchanges with a <i>yod</i> in the word <i>ve-kove</i> (but they that wait)<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>kove</i> is spelled <i>kof, vav, yod</i>. This comment presents a problem. <i>Prima facie</i>, no <i>yod</i> has been interchanged for a <i>vav</i> in <i>kove</i>, because this is the normal construct form of the word. Compare, <i>love</i> (<i>lamed, vav, heh</i>) and <i>shave</i> (<i>shin, vav, heh</i>). We must assume that I.E. read <i>koye</i> rather than <i>kove</i> (same vocalization but different spelling). See Rabbi David Kimchi and S. Kraus, <i>Sefer Yeshayahu</i>, edited by A. Kahanah, on Is. 40:31.</i> in <i>But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength</i> (Is. 40:31). 
The word <i>dever</i> (murrain) is a collective noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For pestilence. It does not refer to any particular disease (Weiser).</i> Its verbal form<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew nouns have verbal forms.</i> is found employed only once, in <i>va-tedabber</i> (she destroyed) in <i>she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah</i> (II Chron. 22:10). The book of Kings<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 11:1 and II Chron. 22:10 relate the same events in slightly different words.</i> reads, <i>va-te’abed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-tedabber</i> is parallel to <i>va-te’abed</i>. As <i>va-te’abed</i> means: and she destroyed, <i>va-tedabber</i> means: and she destroyed.</i> (and she destroyed) (II Kings 11:1). This interpretation is far-fetched.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that <i>va- tedabber</i> means and she destroyed. Perhaps it means she plotted against, or she waylaid, as in its Arabic cognate <i>dabbra</i>.</i> However, we know of no better one.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">We must accept the reading of the parallel verse as its meaning, i.e., that <i>va-tedabber</i> means the same as <i>va-te’abed</i>.</i>

Verse 4

AND THE LORD SHALL MAKE A DIVISION…NOTHING. The word <i>davar</i> (nothing)<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a thing.</i> is used in reference to many words joined together, as in <i>ha-davar</i> (the word)<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">God spoke many words to Jeremiah. Thus Scripture should have read, <i>ha-devarim</i>, as in <i>eleh ha-devarim</i> (these are the words) (Deut. 1:1). Thus I.E. explains that <i>davar</i> can refer to many words.</i> in <i>The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah</i> (Jer. 46:13). It is also used in reference to a thing, as in our verse. <i>Davar</i> in <i>thou hast not lacked a thing</i> is similar (Deut. 2:7).

Verse 5

AND THE LORD APPOINTED. He set a fixed time for the sign to begin.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">So that the Egyptians would not think that the plague came about by accident (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 6

AND THE LORD DID. The meaning of <i>and all</i> (kol) <i>the cattle of Egypt died</i> is, that most of the cattle of Egypt died. For behold, it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the hail.</i> <i>Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle</i> (v. 19).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">If all the cattle died from murrain, what cattle were left to be struck by the hail?</i> We find the same with regard to the plague of hail.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">That Scripture uses the term <i>kol</i> (all or every) but means most.</i> Scripture reads, <i>and the hail smote every herb of the field</i> (v. 25). The plague of locusts concerning which it is written, <i>and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail</i> (Ex. 10:5) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">If the hail destroyed every herb of the field, what was left for the locusts to eat?</i>

Verse 7

SO MUCH AS ONE. <i>Ad echad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, until one.</i> means, as I will explain in the song of Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I.E. on Ex. 14:28.</i> <i>so much as one</i>. The meaning of our verse is: even though Pharaoh sent agents and saw that God loves Israel and on their account smote his flocks,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">While none of theirs perished.</i> he was not so bothered by the death of the flocks during this plague as to let Israel go. Perhaps the plague did not last a long time.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Once the plague quickly passed he was no longer afraid and hence did not let Israel go. Similarly, he did not ask Moses to intercede for him as he had done in the case of the plague of the frogs. See Ex. 8:4.</i>

Verse 8



Verse 9

AND IT SHALL BECOME. This was miraculous, that this small amount of soot turned into dust all over the land of Egypt. This plague did not separate out the Israelites.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on Ex. 7:24.</i>
BLAINS. The <i>alef</i> of <i>avabu’ot</i> (blains) is superfluous, as <i>avabu’ot</i> comes from the same root as <i>tiveh</i> (to boil)<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>bet, ayin, heh</i>.</i> in <i>And the fire causeth the waters to boil</i> (Is. 64:1).

However, the <i>heh</i> drops out and the <i>shin</i> and <i>ayin</i> are doubled, forming the apparently quadriliteral <i>teshasha’u</i>.</i> (Is. 66:12) and <i>tesagsegi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Its original root is <i>sin, gimel, heh</i>.

Verse 10

AND THEY TOOK THE SOOT OF THE FURNACE. Each as earlier noted took handfuls of soot and Moses threw all of it heavenward.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">As clearly stated in verse 8. Even though Aaron took a handful of soot it was Moses who threw the soot toward heaven. See also I.E. on Ex. 8:12.</i> It is possible that the magicians were not smitten with the plague of frogs and swarms. Through their wisdom and their knowledge of natural law they searched for a way to gain a small respite.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">And hence were not smitten by the frogs and swarms.</i> However, their knowledge now failed them, as Scripture tells us.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The boils were upon the magicians</i> (v. 11).</i> Pharaoh did not ask Moses and Aaron to entreat the Lord<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">As he did in the case of the frogs (Ex. 8:4).</i> because the plague did not last long. We cannot conclude from the plain meaning of the text that since the first plague lasted for seven days all the other plagues did so too. Additionally, we shall pursue the text of Scripture. It is known that the plague of murrain lasted for one hour<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a very short time, for death by pestilence is immediate.</i> and the plague of darkness for three days. There is no way to ascertain in which month Moses came and the plagues commenced.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis the plagues lasted for an entire year. See <i>Eduyot</i> 2:10, “the judgment of the Egyptians endured twelve months.” Similarly <i>Seder Olam</i>, 3. Also, according to the rabbis, since Israel was delivered in Nisan and the plagues lasted a year they had to commence in Iyar (<i>Seder Olam</i> 3). It is possible to further interpret the rabbinic statement that the judgment of the Egyptians lasted for one year to mean that it lasted for one year from the time that Moses first appeared before Pharaoh. If we assume the aforementioned then Moses first appeared before Israel and Pharaoh in the month of Iyar. Furthermore, if we accept the fact that the judgment of the Egyptians lasted for a year then each of the ten plagues struck a little over a month apart (Tiferet Israel on <i>Eduyot</i> 3:10). Cf. <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 9:12, “Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah: One says Moses warned them for 24 days before (he plague struck and the plague ravaged them for seven days. The other one says he warned them for seven days and the plague ravaged them for 24 days.”</i> However, if our holy sages received this via tradition we accept and abide by it.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that the plagues ravaged seven days, that a new one struck each month, that the plagues lasted for a year, and that Moses appeared in the month of Iyar. See note above.</i>

Verse 11



Verse 12

AND THE LORD HARDENED THE HEART OF PHARAOH. He therefore did not request Moses to entreat the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">As he did in the case of the frogs and swarms.</i>

Verse 13

AND THE LORD SAID. Scripture does not here note that Pharaoh went out unto the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">As it does in Ex. 7:15 with regard to the plague of blood and in Ex. 8:16 with regard to the swarms.</i> Perhaps he had another reason for rising early.

Verse 14

FOR. Scripture reads, <i>all My plagues</i> because thunder, hail, rain, and fire combined in this plague. We do not find Pharaoh to be as afraid of all the passing plagues as he was of this one.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the combination of thunder, hail, rain, and fire.</i> He also said,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Due to his great fear of this plague.</i> <i>the Lord is righteous</i> (v. 27).
[THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE ME IN ALL THE EARTH.] This was said<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>There is none like Me in all the earth</i> implies that there are other gods but that they are weaker than the Lord. Hence I.E. comments that the Lord spoke in accordance with Egyptian belief that there are other gods.</i> in accordance with Egyptian belief that their gods had the power to harm or to benefit.

Verse 15

AND SMITTEN. <i>Va-akh</i> (and smitten) is missing a <i>nun</i>. It is like the word <i>ve-at</i> (though I was offering) in <i>Though I was offering them food</i> (Hos. 11:4). They are both the same. Their roots are <i>nun, tet, heh</i> and <i>nun, kaf, heh</i>.
[PESTILENCE.] Scripture reads, <i>ba-dever</i> (with pestilence)<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>be-dever. Ba-dever</i> is short for <i>be-ha-dever</i> (with the pestilence) and according to I.E. should be so translated, hence his comment.</i> because it refers to the well-known pestilence. It means: I would have killed all of you along with your cattle with the pestilence with which I smote them.

Verse 16

BUT IN VERY DEED FOR THIS CAUSE<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The word cause is not in the Hebrew text. The Hebrew reads: But in very deed for this have I made thee to stand.</i> HAVE I MADE THEE TO STAND. Scripture goes on to explain the meaning of <i>zot</i> (this). It means <i>to show thee My power</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is to be understood as follows: <i>But in very deed for this</i>, i.e., to show thee My power, and that My name my be declared throughout all the worlds have I allowed thee to exist.</i> <i>And out of the midst thereof as the color of electrum, out of the midst of the fire</i> (Ezek. 1:4) is similar. However, Yefet says that its meaning is, for this plague,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>This</i> is short for this plague.</i> the reference being to the plague of hail.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is to be understood as follows: But for this plague have I made thee to stand, etc.</i>
[AND THAT MY NAME MAY BE DECLARED THROUGHOUT ALL THE EARTH.] This does not refer to Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The form <i>sapper</i> is used both for the imperative and the infinitive. If it is taken as an imperative then it is Pharaoh who is being addressed, and our verse should be interpreted as follows: and that thou shalt declare My name throughout all the earth.</i> On the contrary, the word <i>sapper</i> (be declared) is an infinitive like the word <i>kabbed</i> (promote)<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kabbed</i>, like <i>sapper</i>, is used for both the imperative and the infinitive.</i> in <i>for I will promote thee unto very great honor</i> (Num. 22:17). Its meaning is not that Pharaoh will go all over the world to declare God’s glory, but rather that God’s name would be declared from generation to generation because of the signs which He performed.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes issue with the Midrash and <i>Targum Jonathan</i>, which take <i>sapper</i> as an infinitive. <i>Targum Jonathan</i> translates, <i>u-min bi-gelal de-tini shemi kadisha be-khol arah</i> (and so that thou shall declare My holy name all over the earth). Also see the <i>Mekhilta</i>, Ex. 6, wherein we read:”…<i>There remained not so much as one of them</i> (Ex. 14:28)…Rabbi Nahman says, excluding Pharaoh, for concerning him it says, <i>But in very deed for this cause</i>, etc.” That is, that thou shalt declare My name all over the earth. Also Rashi on Ex. 12:29 interprets <i>sapper</i> as an imperative. Rashi comments, “Pharaoh too was a first-born but he remained alive out of all the first-born. Concerning him Scripture states, <i>But in very deed for this cause</i>, etc.”</i>

Verse 17

AS YET EXALTEST THOU THYSELF AGAINST MY PEOPLE. <i>Mistolel</i> (exaltest) means praises. It comes from the same root as the word <i>salseleha</i> (extol her) in <i>Extol her, and she will exalt thee</i> (Prov. 4:8). Now even though its first root letter is doubled<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>samekh</i>, the first root letter, appears twice. Similarly the <i>lamed</i>, its second root letter. Thus the word appears to come from a quadriliteral root; i.e., its stem appears to be <i>samekh, lamed, samekh, lamed</i>, whereas the root of <i>mistolel</i> is <i>samekh, lamed, lamed</i>,</i> it still belongs among the double roots.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">It basic root is <i>samekh, lamed, lamed</i> even though it appears to have a quadriliteral root. See I.E. on verse 9 and the notes thereto.</i> It<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Salseleha</i>. So I.E. on Prov. 4:8.</i> is similar to the word <i>solu</i> (extol)<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Which comes from the root <i>samekh, lamed, lamed</i>.</i> in <i>Extol him that rideth upon the skies</i> (Ps. 68:5). Likewise <i>ve-gilgaltikha</i> (and roll thee down)<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>ve-gilgaltikha</i> appears to be <i>gimel, lamed, gimel, lamed</i>. However, its real root is <i>gimel, lamed, lamed</i>.</i> (Jer. 51:25) is similar to <i>mitgolel</i> (wallowing) (II Sam. 20:12) and <i>golu</i> (roll). However, Rabbi Merinus says that the meaning of <i>mistolel</i> (exaltest) is strengthens and comes from the same root as <i>mesillot</i> in <i>And the king made of the sandalwood pillars</i> (mesillot)<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. renders paths.</i> <i>for the house of the Lord</i> (II Chron. 9:11). Elsewhere it is written, <i>And the king made of the sandalwood pillars</i> (misad)<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that <i>misad</i> is parallel to <i>mesillot</i>. As <i>misad</i> means a support (from the root <i>samekh, ayin, dalet</i>) or something which gives strength, so does <i>mesillot</i>.</i> <i>for the house of the Lord</i> (I Kings 10:12).

Verse 18

I WILL CAUSE IT TO RAIN. It is well known that even today neither rain nor hail comes down upon the land of Egypt. There is no need to explain why this is so.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This is not the place to go into it.</i> The same is still true of many other places. It was because of this that the Egyptians were greatly afraid, for with the exception of something resembling dew, nothing<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Neither rain nor hail.</i> rains down there.

Verse 19

SEND HASTEN. The word <i>ha-ez</i> (hasten) means make to flee<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">To a safe place.</i> or gather.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Into a safe place.</i> <i>He-izu</i> (flee) in <i>The inhabitants of Gebim flee to cover</i> (Is. 10:31) is similar.

Verse 28

ENTREAT THE LORD. Pharaoh made mention of the glorious name<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YHVH</i>, for Pharaoh said, <i>Entreat YHVH</i> (the Lord).</i> and referred to <i>kolot Elohim</i> (noises from God) because he, as I have already noted, admitted to the existence of a Deity.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on Ex. 6:2 and 8:15.</i> Moses combined the proper and adjectival names and said, “the Lord God” (<i>YHVH / Adonai Elohim</i>) because Pharaoh did not employ the term <i>kolot YHVH / Adonai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">But rather used the term <i>kolot Elohim</i>. Since Pharaoh referred to <i>YHVH / Adonai</i> and to <i>Elohim</i>, he, being a pagan, might have referred to two deities. Hence Moses used the term <i>YHVH / Adonai Elohim</i> (the Lord God), which means <i>YHVH</i> alone is God.</i> The meaning of <i>YHVH / Adonai Elohim</i> is: the Lord alone is God. We never find Moses employing this phrase<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YHVH / Adonai Elohim</i>. Because Moses addressed Israelites, and they knew that <i>YHVH / Adonai</i> alone is God.</i> in the entire Torah. The term <i>Adonai Elohim</i> in <i>O Lord God, Thou hast begun</i> (Deut. 3:24) does not refute the aforementioned, as <i>Adonai</i> is written there with an <i>alef, dalet</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>YHVH.</i> Hence it does not mean <i>YHVH</i> alone is God but rather <i>O Lord God.</i></i>

He renders <i>terem tire’un</i> as: you will not yet fear. However, I.E. quoted Rashi as saying that <i>terem</i> means no. Most of the commentaries avoid the issue. They apparently believe that I.E. was laconic in quoting Rashi. However, in his short commentary, I.E. quotes Rabbi Judah the grammarian as saying that <i>terem</i> means no. Weiser suggests that I.E. confused Rashi and Rabbi Judah in his long commentary. Since, as has been shown in Vol. 1 of this work, I.E. often quoted from memory and, as Birnbaum notes, did not always have time to edit his writings, it is quite possible that Weiser is right.</i> He interprets <i>terem yishkavu</i> (but before they lay down) (Gen. 19:4) similarly.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on our verse interprets it as meaning: they did not as yet lie down.</i> However, the meaning of this word is not as he imagined, as the subject always follows.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Not yet or no implies the end of a subject. However, <i>terem</i> is almost always followed by a subject. Hence I.E. interprets <i>terem</i> as meaning before. The problem with I.E.’s interpretation is that in our verse, unlike Gen. 19:4, the term seems to end the subject under conversation. It is to answer the latter that I.E. quotes Saadiah Gaon and then offers his own interpretation.</i> Following <i>terem yishkavu</i> (but before they lay down) Scripture reads, <i>the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round:</i> its meaning is, at the time when they lay down they <i>compassed the house round.</i> The word <i>terem</i> (before) in <i>before they call, I will answer</i> (Is. 65:24) and <i>terem</i> (before) in <i>Yea before the fat was made to smoke</i> (I Sam. 2:15) are similar. The same applies to all times the word <i>terem</i> is used. Thus <i>terem</i> never has the meaning of no.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">That is, of not yet.</i> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon of blessed memory connected the whole subject.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah Gaon the meaning of <i>terem</i> is before. He connects verses 29-32. If he did not connect them, verse 30 would make no sense for it would end reading: I know before you fear the Lord God.</i> He explained it as follows. Moses said to Pharaoh, I shall pray for the hail to be removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 29.</i> However, what it destroyed, it destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> 

Verse 31

The meaning of <i>And the flax and the barley were smitten</i><sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> is, the flax and barley shall not return<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">For they have already been destroyed, and what is destroyed is destroyed.</i> and I shall not pray for their recovery.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">However, I shall pray for the wheat and the spelt because they have not yet been smitten (v. 32).</i> Behold, its meaning is,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of verse 30 and verse 31.</i> before you fear God and confess and say the Lord is righteous,<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 30.</i> the barley and flax shall already be smitten. This <i>vav</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31 starts with a <i>vav</i>. This seems to indicate that, contra Saadiah Gaon, the verse introduces a new topic and is not dependent on verse 30. If it were, it should read, <i>ki terem tire’un mepene Adonai Elohim ha-pishtah ve-hase’orah nu-katah</i> (but before you will fear the Lord God, the flax and the barley will be smitten). The fact that it opens with <i>ve-ha-pishtah</i> (and the barley) shows that verse 31 is an independent verse. The same applies to the <i>vav</i> that opens verse 32.</i> as I have noted, is correctly used according to the Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>vav</i> at the beginning of a verse does not always introduce an independent clause. See I.E. on verse 21 and the notes thereto.</i> However, in my opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. agrees with Saadiah Gaon that <i>terem</i> means before. However, he does not see any need to connect and interpret the verses as Saadiah does.</i> a word<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Actually two words, <i>efrosh</i> (I spread) <i>kapai</i> (my hands).</i> has been omitted,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Adding these two words eliminates the problem of no appropriate subject following <i>terem.</i></i> its interpretation being: before I spread my hands you will fear the Lord, viz., you and your servants.

We do not find this in any other place.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses politely alluded to the fact that Pharaoh would change his mind as soon as the plague disappeared (Weiser).</i>

I.E. holds that verse 31 is independent. He explains that it relates what happened next, not what Moses told Pharaoh about his limited fear of God. See I.E.’s comment on verse 30 and the notes thereto.</i> It is clear from the word <i>nukkatah</i> (were smitten) and also from the word <i>nukku</i> (were smitten) (v. 32)<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nukkkatah</i> and <i>nukku</i> are third person <i>pu’als</i>. Their root is <i>nun, kaf, heh</i>. In the verb <i>makkeh</i>, which is a <i>hifil</i>, the <i>nun</i> is missing.</i> that the root of <i>makkeh</i> (smite) is <i>nun, kaf, heh</i>.

Verse 32

THEY RIPEN LATE. <i>Afilot</i> (ripen late) is an adjective. The word <i>afel</i> (darkness), as in, <i>darkness, and not light</i>, is close in meaning to it. It means that they were beneath the earth<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Being beneath the earth is like being in a dark place.</i> and unseen.

Verse 33

POURED. <i>Nittakh</i> (poured) is used in the same sense as <i>ke-hittukh</i> (as is melted) in<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Or turns liquid. Similarly, <i>nittakh</i> in our verse refers to liquid.</i> <i>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace</i> (Ezek. 22:22).

Verse 34

AND WHEN PHARAOH SAW. Scripture now mentions, <i>he sinned yet more</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Which it never did before.</i> because Pharaoh confessed and said, <i>I have sinned this time</i> (v. 27).<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture notes that he continued to sin even after he had confessed his transgression.</i>
[AND HARDENED HIS HEART, HE AND HIS SERVANTS.] From this, Moses’ words, <i>But as for thee and thy servants</i> (v. 30), become clear.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses was justified in saying what he did (Weiser).</i>

Verse 35

Chapter 10



Verse 1

GO IN UNTO PHARAOH. Go in unto him this time<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This last time of your own accord; henceforth Pharaoh shall ask you to come to him (Weiser).</i> and do not be astonished that he has hardened his heart until now,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Do not be discouraged by the fact that he has not as yet let Israel go.</i> <i>For I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants.</i> God mentioned <i>the heart of his servants</i> because their hearts<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike Pharaoh’s heart.</i> would mellow with the coming of the plague of the locusts.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 7, <i>And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him…Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God.</i></i>
[FOR I HAVE HARDENED HIS HEART.] Its meaning is: I have hardened his heart that <i>I might show these My signs in the midst of them.</i> The Spanish scholars differ with regard to the word <i>shiti</i> (I might show).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, I might put.</i> Some say that <i>shiti</i> is similar to <i>binu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which is <i>bet, yod, nun.</i></i> (consider) (Deut. 32:7), <i>simu</i> (set)<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which is <i>sin, yod, mem.</i></i> (Gen. 43:21), and other such words.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Words having a <i>yod</i> as their middle root letter. In other words, <i>shiti</i> is a <i>kal</i> from the root <i>shin, yod, tav.</i></i> The same is the case<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">They are all <i>kals</i> having a <i>yod</i> as their middle root letter.</i> with <i>yashit</i> (he will put), <i>yasim</i> (he will place), <i>yavin</i> (he will understand), and comparable words<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Words similarly vocalized.</i> in all of their<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Conjugational forms.</i> forms. Others hold that <i>shiti</i> is a <i>hifil</i> minus the sign of the form,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh.</i> Because it is a <i>hifil</i> the word should read <i>hashiti.</i></i> because they found the words <i>yasum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yasum</i> is a <i>kal</i> from the root <i>sin, vav, mem</i>. Now if <i>shiti</i> was a <i>kal</i> it should read <i>yashut</i> (like <i>yasum</i>), rather than <i>yashit</i>, in the third person imperfect form. Hence the form <i>yashit</i> must be a <i>hifil</i>. Similarly, if <i>shiti</i> were a <i>kal</i> it would read <i>shuti</i>. It should be noted that these grammarians assume that the root of <i>shiti</i> is <i>shin, vav, tav</i> (Weiser).</i> (maketh) and <i>la-sus</i> (rejoice)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>La-sus</i> is a <i>kal</i> infinitive from the root <i>sin, vav, sin</i>. Here too we see that such roots are vocalized in the <i>kal</i> with a <i>shuruk</i>, not with a <i>chirik</i> as <i>shiti</i> is. Hence <i>shiti</i> cannot be a <i>kal</i>. The point of these grammarians is that when we come across forms such as <i>yasis, yashit</i> and the like, we are dealing with <i>hifils</i> having a <i>vav</i> as a middle root letter. When we come across forms such as <i>yasus, yashut</i>, we are dealing with <i>kals</i> having a <i>vav</i> as a middle root letter. Hence the word <i>shiti</i> must be a <i>hifil</i> (Weiser).</i> in <i>who maketh a man dumb</i> (Ex. 4:11) and <i>for the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced over thy fathers</i> (Deut. 30:9), all of which are <i>kals</i>. Others say that <i>yasis</i> is similar to <i>yasus</i> (he will rejoice)<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yasis</i> is not a <i>hifil</i>; it is a <i>kal</i>. The reason it is pronounced <i>yasis</i> and not <i>yasus</i> is that <i>yasis</i> comes from the root <i>sin, yod, sin</i>, and <i>yasus</i> comes from the root <i>yod, vav, sin</i> (Weiser).</i> and <i>shiti</i> to <i>sumi</i> (set).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">There are two roots for the word set. One comes from the root <i>sin, yod, mem</i>, and one from the root <i>sin, vav, mem</i>. Compare, <i>som tasim</i> (thou shalt in any wise set) (Deut. 17:15). <i>Som</i> comes from the root <i>sin, vav, mem</i>, and <i>tasim</i> from the root <i>sin, yod, mem</i>. Both <i>som</i> and <i>tasim</i> are <i>kals</i>. It is the same with the words for put/set. One word comes from the root <i>shin, vav, vav</i>, and the other from the root <i>shin, yod, tav. Shiti</i> comes from the latter root, hence its vocalization.</i> They are all <i>kals</i>. In Ex. 12:9 we find: “Behold, I the writer add to the words of this sage as I heard from his mouth.”

Verse 2

AND THAT THOU MAYEST TELL. God spoke to Moses, who is equivalent to all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And that thy mayest tell</i> doesn’t only refer to Moses, to whom God was speaking, but to all of Israel. The point is that Israel might tell their children and grandchildren all that God did to Egypt.</i> Similarly, <i>that ye may know that I am the Lord</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Which closes our verse.</i> means that all Israel shall know the aforementioned. The Torah speaks in human terms when it says, <i>I have wrought</i>, for it pictures God as acting as a human being who arranges events in order to avenge himself upon another.

Verse 3

AND MOSES AND AARON WENT IN. We know that Moses would not come in unto Pharaoh unless Aaron was with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Hence what need is there for Scripture to mention Aaron?</i> as Aaron was his spokesman.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore Moses would not go to Pharaoh without Aaron. See I.E. on Ex. 4:30 and 7:2.</i> Scripture here mentions Moses and Aaron because now, unlike any of the other instances of the plagues, they were both returned to and finally expelled from the presence of Pharaoh.
TO HUMBLE. <i>Le’anot</i> (to humble) is a <i>nifal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning thus is, to be humbled.</i> It comes from the same root as <i>ani</i> (humble).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>ayin, nun, heh</i>.</i>

Verse 4

LOCUSTS. <i>Arbeh</i> (locusts) is the name of a type of locust.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser.</i> Perhaps it is so called because it is more numerous than other kinds of locusts.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>resh, bet, heh</i>, meaning numerous.</i> Scripture states, <i>That which the palmer-worm</i> (gazam)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">A type of locust.</i> <i>hath left hath the locust</i> (arbeh) <i>eaten</i> (Joel 1:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Joel mentions four types of locusts: <i>gazam, arbeh, yelek</i>, and <i>chasil</i>. We thus see that <i>arbeh</i> is a type of locust.</i> Concerning it, Scripture states, <i>My great army which I sent among you</i> (Joel 2:25). If this be the case then the <i>alef</i> of <i>arbeh</i> is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">It has no meaning.</i>

Verse 5

AND THEY SHALL COVER. Metaphorically speaking.
THAT ONE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, that shall not be able to see, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The word <i>ish</i> (a man) has been omitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The verse should be understood as if read: that a man shall not be able to see.</i> Yefet says that many days passed between the plague of hail and the plague of locusts, for Scripture states: <i>which groweth for you out of the field</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Which indicates that the locusts ate new produce, as earlier the <i>hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the land</i> (Ex. 9:25).</i>

Verse 6

SHALL BE FILLED. This word<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Male’u</i> (<i>filled</i>) is a third person <i>kal</i> perfect plural. The <i>vav</i> changes it into an imperfect.</i> is irregularly used in the Hebrew language.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. goes on to point out that it is both transitive and intransitive in the <i>kal</i>.</i> The meaning of <i>u-male’u</i> (shall be filled) is that the houses were full of locusts.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, here <i>ma’le’u</i> is intransitive. However, <i>mile’u</i> is transitive. Both are <i>kal</i> forms.</i> However, we also find <i>mile’u</i> (fill) in <i>Fill four jars with water</i> (I Kings 18:34) wherein <i>mile’u</i> is a transitive verb. It is as if it were vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>mem</i> and a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>lamed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Malle’u</i>.</i> and belonged to the conjugational form that receives a <i>dagesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As if it were a <i>pi’el.

[AND HE TURNED.] Rabbi Joshua says that <i>va-yifen</i> (and he turned) refers to Moses, who paid his respects to the throne by facing the king<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Joshua <i>va-yifen</i> means: and he faced. Compare, <i>panim</i> (face).</i> and walking out backwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than turn his back to Pharaoh and leave.</i> However, Yefet says that Moses finished his duties.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">According to Yefet <i>va-yifen</i> means: and he was finished, i.e., finished his duties.

However, what shall Yefet do with the word <i>va-yifen</i> (and he looked) in <i>And he looked this way and that way</i> (Ex. 2:12)?<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Here the word cannot be taken to mean he was disengaged, for what sense is there to a clause that reads: and he was finished this way and that way?</i> <i>Va-yifen</i> is to be explained as coming from the same root as <i>panim</i> (face).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>peh, nun, heh</i>. It should be noted that the same applies to the above interpretations. However, I.E. means that the word means to turn the face and look. According to I.E. the meaning of our verse is: and he looked (<i>va-yifen</i>); i.e., he turned his face and went out from Pharaoh.</i> It has the same meaning as <i>va-yar</i> (and he saw). Now Moses left the presence of Pharaoh without his permission. Scripture notes this because Pharaoh asked that Moses and Aaron be brought back. After they were returned Pharaoh, in anger, commanded that they be driven out.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This time Pharaoh did not want to give Moses the chance to insult him by leaving on his own.</i>

Verse 7

AND PHARAOH’S SERVANTS SAID. The meaning of <i>ha-terem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>terem</i> means before. See I.E. on Ex. 10:30 and the notes thereto.</i> <i>teda</i> (knowest thou not yet) is: do you first want it to become clear to you that Egypt is destroyed.

Verse 8

WERE BROUGHT AGAIN. The word <i>et</i> indicates the thing itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">It is used for emphasis. I.E. goes on to explain the meaning of <i>et</i> because our text reads, <i>va-yushav et moshe ve-et aharon</i>, (and Moses and Aaron were brought again).</i> Now whether one says <i>ha-adam ohavi</i> (the man loves me), in which the <i>yod</i> is a first person pronominal suffix, or he says <i>ha-adam ohev oti</i> (the man loves me),<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Oti</i> is a form of <i>et</i>.</i> the reference being to my very self,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Oti</i> refers to the very persona.</i> the meaning is one and the same. Therefore, if someone says <i>re’uven harag <span class="underline">et</span> shimon</i> (Reuben killed Simeon) he is telling us that Simeon has been slain. However, the same is the case if he says, <i>re’uven harag shimon</i> (Reuben killed Simeon).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>et</i> does not make a difference. <i>Re’uven harag et shimon</i> means the same as <i>re’uven harag shimon</i>.</i> <i>Ve-rav ya’avod tza’ir</i> (and the elder shall serve the younger) (Gen. 25:23)<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">It has the same meaning as <i>ve-rav ya’avod et ha-tza’ir</i>.</i> and <i>asher bara Elohim adam</i> (that God created man) (Deut. 4:32)<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">It has the same meaning as <i>asher bara Elohim et ha-adam</i>.</i> are similar. Do not think that <i>et</i> indicates the direct object because it is often found to be so used.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">It is so found most often in Scripture.</i> It is also found before the subject, as in <i>u-va ha-ari ve-et ha-dov</i> (and when there came a lion, or a bear) (I Sam. 17:34)<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Here it emphasizes the subject rather than the object.</i> and many other similar cases. Rabbi Judah the grammarian says that Scripture reads, <i>va-yushav</i> (were brought again) rather than <i>va-yushevu</i> (were brought again)<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yushav</i> is in the singular. Its literal meaning is, was brought again. Since Scripture speaks of Moses and Aaron we would expect the plural, <i>va-yushevu</i>.</i> because of the word <i>et</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>va-yushav</i> is connected to the word <i>et</i>, which does not take on a different form before a plural, it too does not take on a plural form (Filwarg).</i> However, I believe that Scripture reads, <i>va-yushav</i> because Moses was the most important one. Scripture similarly reads, <i>va-tedabber miriam ve-aharon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-tedabber</i> is a feminine singular. Since Scripture speaks of Miriam and Aaron we would expect a plural masculine.</i> (And Miriam and Aaron spoke) (Num. 12:1) because Miriam was the main speaker.

Verse 9

FOR WE MUST HOLD A FEAST UNTO THE LORD. All of us are obligated to sacrifice unto the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the term <i>chag</i> (feast) means a sacrifice, and our clause is to be translated: for we must sacrifice unto the Lord.</i>

Verse 10

SO BE THE LORD WITH YOU. Whom you say is with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh was not recognizing the Lord as God. What he was saying was: So be the Lord whom you claim as your God with you (Weiser).</i>
[SEE YE THAT EVIL IS BEFORE YOUR FACE.] The evil is close to you and is before your face. This meaning is also to be connected to <i>for that is what ye desire</i> (v. 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>For that is what ye desire</i> refers to the evil mentioned in our verse; i.e., the clause is to be understood: for it is evil that you desire.</i> Hence it is only right that I so act. At this point Pharaoh surmised that they wanted to flee.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he threatened them with evil.</i> Note that our Master Moses did not go so far as to lie and say that Israel would return. He merely said that they would travel a three days’ journey (Ex. 9:23). However, the Egyptians thought that they would return. Hence they let them have what they asked.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment</i> (Ex. 12:35).

However, God commanded Moses to act in this manner so that Pharaoh would chase after them and drown. Behold, this is clearly stated, <i>that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth</i> (Ex. 14:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture goes on to say, <i>And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel: They are entangled in the land…and he shall follow after them</i> (Ex. 14:3, 4).</i> One should not question the acts of God,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Why did God mislead Pharaoh into thinking that Israel was lost in the desert so that he would pursue them? He could have drowned Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea without employing military strategy.</i> as He does everything with wisdom, though it be hidden from the eyes even of wise men. We find a similarity in the account of David, viz., <i>And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the Lord gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines</i> (II Sam. 5:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">David too was told by God to use strategy in fighting the Philistines. David inquired of the Lord how to attack the Philistines. The Lord answered him, <i>Thou shalt not go up; make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the Lord gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines</i> (II Sam. 5:23, 24). Here too God instructed David to lead the Philistines into a trap so that God would destroy them. The Lord acted in this manner even though He could have destroyed them without employing this strategy.</i>

Verse 11

NOT SO; GO NOW YE THAT ARE MEN. The word <i>gever</i> (man), unlike the word <i>adam</i> (man),<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Adam</i> can refer to both a male or a female. Compare, Gen. 1:27.</i> always refers to a man in Scripture.
FOR THAT IS WHAT YE DESIRE. The above-noted evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in verse 10.</i>

Verse 12

FOR THE LOCUSTS. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that <i>ba-arbeh</i> (for the locusts) indicates that Moses placed a locust on the rod.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Moses takes the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-arbeh</i> to mean with. Compare, the <i>bet</i> in <i>be-tuppim u-vimcholot</i> (<span class="underline">with</span> timbrels <span class="underline">and</span> with dances) (Jud. 11:34). Rabbi Moses interprets our verse as follows: Stretch out thy hand <span class="underline">with</span> the locust over the land of Egypt.</i> However, this is incorrect. The correct interpretation of <i>ba-arbeh</i> is: so that the locusts would come.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>bet</i> has the meaning of because.

Verse 13

AN EAST WIND. <i>Kadim</i> (east) is an adjective, since <i>kedemah mizrachah</i> (the east side) is a noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>kedemah</i> is a noun and <i>kadim</i> an adjective.</i> <i>Kadim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning be in front, before.</i> is so called because it is the first of the sides<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">To see the sun.</i> because the sun begins to shine there. Hence the west is termed <i>achor</i> (hinder side).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">It is the last side to see the sun.</i> Compare, <i>Behold, I go forward</i> (kedem), <i>but He is not there, And backward</i> (achor), <i>but I cannot perceive Him</i> (Job 23:8).
BROUGHT THE LOCUSTS. From its place and deposited them in all the kingdom of Egypt.

Verse 14

WENT UP. <i>Neither after them shall be such</i> was prophetically written.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah prophesies that there will never be an exact duplication of this plague again.</i>

Verse 15

FOR THEY COVERED THE FACE OF THE WHOLE EARTH. The meaning of <i>so the land was darkened</i> is that the locusts intervened between the sun and the land. The land is always dark.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The earth gets its light from the sun; hence without sunlight it is dark.</i>

Verse 16

THEN PHARAOH CALLED FOR MOSES AND AARON IN HASTE. Via his messengers.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh did not personally call them.</i> Pharaoh added, I have sinned, because he drove them away from his presence in disgrace.

Verse 17

NOW THEREFORE FORGIVE, I PRAY THEE. I will explain the term <i>sa na</i> (forgive, I pray thee) in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 34:4, where I.E. explains that the phrase has two meanings, to forgive or to bear sin. Here it means to forgive.</i>
[ONLY THIS ONCE.] Because I will not sin again by rebelling against the Lord. Pharaoh did not promise to free the people because Moses was angry.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">And Pharaoh did not want to engage him any further in conversation (Weiser).</i> Moses went out of the city as was his wont<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">When he prayed.</i> and prayed.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Moses could not pray within the city because of the idols therein. See I.E. on Ex. 9:29.</i>

Verse 18



Verse 19

AND THE LORD TURNED AN EXCEEDING STRONG WEST WIND. West is termed <i>yam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Sea.</i> in the holy tongue because the great sea<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The Mediterranean. Scripture refers to the sea which borders the Land of Israel on the west as the “great sea.” Cf. Num. 34:6; Jos. 1:4; 9:1.</i> which goes out from Spain and passes by the land of Egypt and goes on to the Land of Israel lies in the west. This sea is not to be identified with the Atlantic Ocean because Israel did not inherit that much territory.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The Land of Israel was not that vast as to reach the Atlantic.</i> The Spanish Sea is called the great sea because it is three hundred Persian miles wide, whereas none of the seas in the Land of Israel such as the Sea of Reeds, the Kineret, and the Salt Sea is even thirty Persian miles wide.

Verse 20

BUT THE LORD HARDENED. This is to be understood à la the words of our sages of blessed memory who said, “The door is opened for one who comes to defile himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sabbath</i> 104a; <i>Yoma</i> 38b.</i>

Verse 21

AND THE LORD SAID. We may logically assume although it is not so stated that Moses’ staff was in his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">When he stretched out his hand towards heaven. See I.E. on Ex. 9:22.</i>
EVEN DARKNESS WHICH MAY BE FELT. Yefet says that <i>ve-yamesh</i> (which may be felt) is like <i>ve-yamish</i> (and it shall depart);<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>mem, vav, shin</i>, meaning to depart or remove. Compare, <i>lo yamish amud he-anan</i>, (the pillar of cloud by day departed not) (Ex. 13:22).</i> its meaning is: that the darkness to which they have become accustomed shall depart and another type of darkness, thicker than it, shall come. Others say that <i>ve-yamesh</i> is missing an <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi. According to Rashi <i>ve-yamesh</i>, spelled <i>vav, yod, mem, shin</i>, is a form of <i>emesh</i>. According to him <i>ve-yamesh choshekh</i> (even darkness which may be felt) means: and the darkness of the night shall be even more dark (Cohen).</i> Now the word <i>emesh</i> in the holy tongue refers to the previous night, like <i>emesh</i> (yesternight) in <i>spoke unto me yesternight</i> (Gen. 31:29). It is the same case with the Arabic <i>ams</i>, as the <i>shin</i> and <i>samekh</i> interchange in most of the words.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">That are cognate to Hebrew and Arabic.</i> Now their interpretation makes no sense.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>emesh</i> means yesternight. Thus <i>ve-yamesh choshekh</i> has to be translated: and yesterday shall be dark. This makes no sense.</i> I believe that <i>ve-yamesh</i> comes from the same root as <i>yemashesh</i> (gropeth) (Deut. 28:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>mem, shin, shin</i>, meaning to feel, to grope.</i> One cannot argue that <i>yemashesh</i> comes from a double root<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">While <i>ve-yamesh</i>, which has one <i>shin</i>, at first glance does not.</i> because with regard to something very similar Scripture uses the term <i>yemishun</i> (handle)<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Or feel.</i> in <i>They have hands but handle not</i> (Ps. 115:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">It too has only one <i>shin</i>, yet its meaning is to feel. As to the root of <i>ve-yamesh</i> and <i>yemishun</i>, they either come from the root <i>mem, vav, shin</i>, which is a variant of the root <i>mem, shin, shin</i>, or they come from the root <i>mem, shin, shin</i> and are conjugated with only one of the double letters. There are a number of other such words. Compare, <i>asev</i> (I will turn around) (root, <i>samekh, bet, bet</i>) and <i>achel</i> (I will begin) (root <i>chet, lamed, lamed</i>). Cf. Weiser.</i> <i>Ve-yamesh</i> refers to Egypt, Egypt being in the singular,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-yamesh</i> is a singular. If <i>ve-yamesh</i> refers to Egypt the plural form should have been used, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> as in <i>so Egypt said I will flee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Anusah</i> (I will flee) is in the singular.</i> (Ex. 14:25). Now the meaning of <i>ve-yamesh choshekh</i> (even darkness which may be felt) is that the Egyptians will feel the darkness with their hands,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>ve-yamesh</i> means: and he shall feel. Thus <i>ve-yamesh choshekh</i> means: and he (Egypt) shall feel the darkness.</i> for the darkness shall be so thick that neither a candle nor a fire shall give off light. <i>They saw not one another</i> (v. 23) neither by the light of day nor by candlelight is proof of the aforementioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes literally, <i>They saw not one another</i>.</i>

Verse 22

AND MOSES STRETCHED FORTH. The Egyptians had no way of knowing that three days passed except through the Israelites, who had light. Now there are times when a thick darkness<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is obviously referring to a thick fog.</i> comes over the Atlantic Ocean during which time it is impossible for a person to distinguish between day and night. The aforementioned occasionally lasts for as long as five days. I myself have been there many times.

Verse 23

NEITHER ROSE ANY FROM HIS PLACE. From his house, as in <i>abide ye every man in his place</i> (Ex. 16:29). For where could they go without light?

Verse 24

AND PHARAOH CALLED. After three days when they saw light.
ONLY LET YOUR FLOCKS AND YOUR HERDS BE STAYED. Pharaoh wanted to know what was in Moses’ mind. He wanted to learn whether Moses planned to escape.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he said, <i>only let your flocks and your herds be stayed</i>. If they intended to return they wouldn’t mind leaving the latter behind.</i> Pharaoh said, <i>let your little ones also go with you</i> because Moses had earlier told him, <i>We will go with our young and with our old</i> (v. 9).

Verse 25

THOU MUST ALSO GIVE INTO OUR HAND SACRIFICES AND BURNT-OFFERINGS. You are obligated to give into our hands sacrifices and burnt offerings to be brought on the altar on your behalf.

Verse 26

THERE SHALL NOT A HOOF BE LEFT BEHIND. Of any kind that are among our cattle, as we do not know which kind we are to choose<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">For offerings.</i> and how many of them we will sacrifice. This is the meaning of <i>we know not with what we must serve</i>.

Verse 27

BUT THE LORD HARDENED PHARAOH’S HEART. In a manner similar to <i>for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate</i> (Deut. 2:30).

Verse 28

THOU SHALT DIE. You will deserve to be put to death for rebelling against the king.

Verse 29

THOU HAST SPOKEN WELL. <i>Ken</i> (well) here has the same meaning as <i>ken</i> (right) in <i>The daughters of Zelophehad speak right</i> (Num. 27:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. there explains <i>ken</i> as meaning true or correct. Our clause may thus be rendered: thou hast spoken truthfully; or, thou hast spoken correctly.</i>
I WILL SEE THY FACE AGAIN NO MORE. For I will never come to you again.

Chapter 11



Verse 1

AND THE LORD SPOKE. The chapter opening with the words, <i>Thus saith the Lord</i> (v. 4)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than our verse.</i> should have been connected to the previous verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">To Ex. 10:29. In other words, 11:4 should have followed 10:29, for in point of fact Moses told Pharaoh, <i>Thus saith the Lord: about midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt; and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die</i> (11:4), after telling him, <i>Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more</i> (10:29).</i> However, the chapter stating, <i>Yet one plague more</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 1-3.</i> was inserted between them. The reason for this is that Scripture wanted to teach us when<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>matai</i>, as in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 48, rather than <i>u-matai</i>, as in the printed editions.</i> <i>Thus saith the Lord</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4 and what follows.</i> was told to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>And the Lord said</i> (v. 1) means: and the Lord had already said, the reference being to what God told Moses in Midian (Ex. 4:23).</i> It was related to Moses while he was yet in Midian,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Contra Rashi, who believes that verses 1-3 contain a prophecy to Moses while in Pharaoh’s palace.</i> viz., <i>Behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born</i> (Ex. 4:23). Moses was commanded on Mount Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 3:22.</i> that when the time came for the plague of the first-born to arrive, every man should ask jewels of his neighbor.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the command to ask for jewels and raiment was also not given at this point.</i> I have already explained why it is there written, <i>but every woman shall ask of her neighbor</i> (Ex. 3:22) and here it is written, <i>and let them ask every man of his neighbor</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 3:22.</i> Now the meaning of <i>And the Lord said unto Moses: Yet one plague more will I bring</i> is that the Lord had already told this to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets <i>va-yomer</i> (and he said) as a pluperfect, meaning: and he had said.</i> There are many such cases in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Where Scripture employs the pluperfect.</i> God said, <i>he shall surely thrust you out</i>, in keeping with His statement, <i>and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land</i> (Ex. 6:1).

Verse 2

SPEAK NOW. I have already explained that the word <i>na</i> means now.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 4:13.</i>

Verse 3

AND THE LORD GAVE. Scripture relates that the Lord kept his promise to Moses: of <i>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians</i> (Ex. 3:21).
[MOREOVER THE MAN MOSES.] For many let them have what they asked out of respect for Moses.
AND IN THE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLE. The people of Egypt.

Verse 4

ABOUT MIDNIGHT. Some grammarians say that <i>ka-chatzot</i> (about midnight) is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A verbal noun meaning: when the night divides in half.</i> Its meaning is, when it shall be exactly one half of the night. They want to compare <i>ka-chatzot ha-laylah</i> (about midnight) to <i>ba-chatzi ha-laylah</i> (at midnight)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Which the Talmud (<i>Berakhot</i> 4a) takes to mean exactly at midnight.</i> in <i>And it came to pass at midnight</i> (Ex. 12:29). Now it is common knowledge that it is beyond the ken of a wise man to ascertain the exact moment of noon without great effort and the use of large copper instruments.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently refers to a sundial.</i> It goes without saying that it is much harder to ascertain the more difficult time of midnight.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture would not employ terms that are meaningless from a practical point of view.</i> I believe that there is no need for all of this since the meaning of <i>ka-chatzot ha-laylah</i> (about midnight) is, when the first half of the night has passed. The same is the case with <i>ba-chatzi ha-laylah</i> in <i>And it came to pass at midnight</i> (Ex. 12:29). It refers to the remaining half of the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Another way of saying after midnight.</i> <i>And it came to pass at midnight</i> (ba-chatzi ha-laylah) (Ruth 3:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>That the man was startled, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet</i>.</i> and <i>At midnight</i> (chatzot laylah) <i>I will rise to give thanks to thee</i> (Ps. 119:62) are convincing proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The exact moment of midnight is irrelevant to what is reported in Ruth 3:8, for what reason can there be to pinpoint the exact moment that the man was startled. Similarly, David had no way of determining the exact moment of midnight while he slept.</i>
[WILL I GO OUT.] The reference is to the decree that goes out from the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>will I go out</i> does not refer to the Lord Himself but to His decree.</i>

Verse 5

THE FIRST-BORN OF PHARAOH THAT SITTETH UPON HIS THRONE. Who is fit to sit upon Pharaoh’s throne after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh’s first-born did not sit on the throne of Egypt, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Moses mentioned the most honored of all the Egyptians, namely, the son of their lord whom all of them serve and also the meanest of them all, namely, the first-born of the maid-servant, who is himself a slave.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that all first-born shall die, from the highest to the lowest.</i>
[THAT IS BEHIND THE MILL.] Who grinds.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Because grinding was the most menial work, it was reserved for slaves and prisoners.</i> Compare, <i>And he did grind in the prison house</i> (Jud. 16:21). I have already explained that the prophets are not careful in preserving the exact wording but are rather concerned with reproducing meanings.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. on Gen. 5:29. Also see his commentary to Ex. 20:1 and the first chapter of the <i>Sefer Ha-Yesod</i>.</i> The words <i>hagmi’ini</i> (give me to drink) (Gen. 24:17)<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken by Abraham’s servant to Rebekah when he asked her for water.</i> and <i>hashkini</i> (give me to drink) (Gen. 29:45);<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Used by Abraham’s servant when he quoted what he had said to Rebekah.</i> <i>zakhor</i> (remember) (Ex. 20:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Which opens the fourth commandment quoted in Exodus.</i> and <i>shamor</i> (observe)<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Which opens the fourth commandment in Deuteronomy.</i> (Deut. 5:12); <i>sheker</i> (false) (Ex. 20:13)<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The term employed for false in the ninth commandment in Exodus.</i> and <i>shav</i> (false) (Deut. 5:17);<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The term employed for false in the ninth commandment in Deuteronomy.</i> <i>lo tachmod</i> (thou shalt not covet) (Ex. 20:14)<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Which opens the tenth commandment in Exodus.</i> and <i>ve-lo titavveh</i> (neither shalt thou covet) (Deut. 5:18)<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Which opens the tenth commandment in Deuteronomy.</i> have one meaning. I will yet discuss this when I comment on the prayer of Moses (Ex. 32:9). Now, <i>the first-born of the maid-servant</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The term used by Moses in our verse.</i> means the same as <i>the first-born of the captive</i> (Ex. 12:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The term used by God when he first told Moses that he would slay all the first-born in the land of Egypt. I.E.’s point is that Moses was not misquoting God, as “the prophets are not careful in preserving the exact wording.”</i> The captive woman is a maid-servant who sleeps in the dungeon at night as prisoners do, as was noted by Joseph when he said, <i>that they should put me into the dungeon</i> (Gen. 40:15).

Verse 6

AND THERE SHALL BE A GREAT CRY. We do not find Scripture elsewhere stating anything like <i>kamohu lo nihyatah ve-khamohu lo tosif</i> (such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A comparable combination of masculine and feminine forms. <i>Kamohu</i> (like it) is masculine whereas <i>nihyatah</i> (hath been) and <i>tosif</i> (shall be) are feminine.</i> The word <i>al</i> (over) has been omitted from our verse and the clause should be understood literally as follows: such as over it there hath been none like it, nor such over it shall be like it a cry anymore.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>nihyatah</i> and <i>tosif</i> refer to <i>tze’akah</i> (cry), a feminine noun mentioned in the first part of the verse. This eliminates the problem of having a masculine preposition/pronoun (<i>kamohu</i>) connected to feminine verbs (<i>nihyatah, tosif</i>).</i> 
Such as like it (<i>kamohu</i>) refers to havoc, calamity, death, and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Although they are not explicitly mentioned in our verse. The Hebrew form of these words is in the masculine. According to I.E. our verse is to be explained as follows: And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt. Over such a calamity there hath been none like it (a cry), nor over such a calamity shall there ever be such (a cry).</i>

Verse 7

SHALL NOT A DOG WHET HIS TONGUE. To frighten them. <i>None whetted his tongue against any of the children of Israel</i> (Josh. 10:21) is similar. Its meaning is that no dog shall bark at them or bite them. Now no dog shall whet his tongue at them or their cattle here on earth. How much more so when He sends a destroyer from heaven to smite their first-born?<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">If God will not allow even a dog to bark at the Israelites, He will certainly not permit His angel to harm them.</i>

Verse 8

AND ALL THESE THY SERVANTS SHALL COME DOWN UNTO ME…SAYING. On your behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">You will send them down to me with the following message.</i>
AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW THEE. <i>Be-raglekha</i> (follow thee) means: who are under your dominion.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-raglekha</i> (follow thee) literally means at thy feet. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> For I will lead them to the place which I desire. <i>And there went up ten thousand at his feet</i> (be-raglav) (Jud. 4:10) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">There too <i>be-raglav</i> means under his dominion.</i> Moses went out in hot anger because Pharaoh had told him, <i>see my face no more</i> (Ex. 10:28).

Verse 9

AND THE LORD SAID. According to the manner of the Hebrews and the rules of language this is to be rendered: and the Lord had already said.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Another way of saying that according to the rules of classical Hebrew, <i>va-yomer</i> can be either a perfect or a pluperfect. Here it must be a pluperfect, as God had already told what is reported in our verse to Moses in verse 1.</i> There are many other such instances.

Verse 10

AND MOSES. Even though Moses and Aaron did all these wonders which are mentioned in Scripture, Pharaoh’s heart did not soften and he did not let them go, because God hardened his heart. The chapter opening with the words, <i>And it came to pass at midnight</i> (Ex. 12:29)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Which describes the death of the first-born.</i> should by right have followed next so that the plagues would be described in order. However, the chapter dealing with, <i>This is the ordinance of the Passover</i> (chap. 12) was inserted in the middle to inform us how the first-born of Israel were saved when the destroyer came upon Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">They were saved by the blood of the paschal lamb which was put on the side-posts and on the lintels of the houses wherein the Passover sacrifice was eaten. See Ex. 12:7-13.</i>

Chapter 12



Verse 1

AND THE LORD SPOKE. Scripture now mentions the first of the commandments given via Moses and Aaron, as they alone were prophets of the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Prophets who revealed commandments to Israel. See I.E. on Gen. 27: 13.</i> After them, except for extenuating circumstances as in the case of Gideon<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Who was commanded by an angel of God to build an altar and offer a burnt offering upon it. Cf. Jud. 6:26.</i> and Elijah,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Who built an altar on Mount Carmel. See I Kings 18:31-38. I.E. assumes that Elijah was commanded by God to do so.</i> no new precepts were revealed. Do not take the chanting of psalms in the house of God instituted by David<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See I Chron. 6:16.</i> to heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Do not assume that it was instituted by divine command.</i> as the latter was an enactment and an institution established by David and Solomon.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Of their own accord. <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads, “established by David and Samuel.” This reading has the support of I Chron. 9:22. Indeed, Filwarg emends Solomon to Samuel. If we do not emend the text then we must interpret I.E. to mean that David established the practice of singing psalms in the house of God and Solomon reaffirmed it when he built the Temple. Cf. Weiser.</i> Thus Scripture states, <i>by their beliefs</i> (II Chron. 9:22), and not by their prophecies. However, Saadiah Gaon says that they had a tradition going back to Moses that a king would arise and innovate musical compositions.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, David did not institute the temple service on his own accord.</i> <i>Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day</i> (Jer. 17:22) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition against carrying a burden on the Sabbath was not instituted by Jeremiah; it was handed down from Moses.</i>

Verse 2

THIS MONTH. Rabbi Judah Ha-Parsi<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">One of the early Karaites. He taught that the festivals are to be established in accordance with a solar calendar. It is interesting to note that I.E. uses the title Rabbi in introducing Judah Ha-Parsi. However, in chapter 1 of his <i>Iggeret Ha-Shabbat</i> he quotes the same opinion and there writes, Judah Ha-Parsi says. Similarly, the Karaite Joshua is sometimes quoted with the title Rabbi. As much as one might want to attribute modern notions of civility to I.E., the probability is that the title Rabbi was added by scribes who were not aware of the fact that I.E. was quoting Karaites. The matter bears further investigation. Be the aforementioned as it is, the fact remains that “Abraham Ibn Ezra was the only rabbi to quote Karaite sources” (L. Roth, <i>Standard Jewish Encyclopedia</i>, p. 1106).</i> says that the Israelites, like the uncircumcised,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Christians.</i> employed a solar calendar. He offers as proof, <i>Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season</i> (Ex. 13:10). But lunar years are not all equal, as the seasons of plowing and harvest are dependent solely on the movement of the sun as it travels to the north or the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>from year to year</i> (mi-yamim yamimah). Thus the verse teaches that the festivals are to be observed each year in their season. This can only be done if a solar calendar is employed, as seasons are determined by the sun, not the moon. Indeed, in a lunar calendar the months eventually fall in different seasons. For example, the Moslem fast of Ramadan at times falls in the summer, winter, fall, and spring because the Moslems employ a lunar calendar.</i> However, he did not speak correctly. I will now explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The workings of the Jewish calendar.</i> We know that it takes the moon, moving in its sphere<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For I.E.’s concept of the moon’s motions, see Vol. 1, p. 5, notes 27-32.</i> in a given point facing the sphere of the zodiac, close to twenty-seven and a third days to return to this very point. Now let us assume a starting point wherein the moon is in conjunction with the sun at the beginning of Aries.

The sun and the moon would next be in conjunction at the end of twenty-nine and a half days, two-thirds and seventy-three parts of an hour, according to the way Israelites divide the hour.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites divide the hour into 1,080 parts.</i> Thus<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Before the moon is in conjunction with the sun again.</i> the moon would have traveled the very degrees that the sun journeyed,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">27 degrees.

Now let us assume the sun to be at the beginning of Aries. It will then travel three hundred and sixty-five days plus close to a quarter of a day in its sphere until it returns a second time to where it started out. It is for this reason that a year is called a <i>shanah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>shin, nun, heh</i> means once again. Hence a <i>shanah</i> is the time it takes the sun to return once again to its point of departure.</i> Now the moon has no year, as the sun has no month. Nothing new happens to the sun; only to the light of the moon does something new occur.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term for a month is <i>chodesh</i>. It comes from the root <i>chet, dalet, shin</i> meaning new.

We have conclusive proof that the moon has no light of its own, and that its light comes from the sun.

A full solar year is 365 and a quarter days.</i> and because they saw that the moon is renewed twelve times during a solar year, they divided the days of the year into twelve parts and called each part a month because it is close to the days of a lunar month. This arrangement of theirs is not in keeping with the laws of nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For the months of the solar year do not begin or end on the day that the moon starts or completes its cycle around the earth.

They saw that there are twelve months in a solar year and they did not find a closer way of reckoning than this,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Since 12 lunar months almost equal one solar year, the Moslems decided that 12 lunar months make up a year.

Now God commanded in His Torah that the festivals be kept in their seasons, for He said, <i>Observe the month of spring and keep the passover unto the Lord thy God</i> (Deut. 16:1). Now if spring is not found<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If spring does not come.</i> by half of the month<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Of Nisan.</i> then we make Passover in the month close to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">We add an additional month.

If we pursue the literal meaning of the text the month of Ziv is not Nisan but Iyyar, for it is written, <i>in the month Ziv, which is the second month</i> (I Kings 6:1), that is, which is known as the second to the first of the months of Israel.

Hence I.E. says that <i>of Solomon’s reign</i> refers to <i>in the fourth year</i>, and the verse is to be understood as follows: And it came to pass…in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month.

I will now give you a general rule. Although the Israelites in the time of the Holy Temple watched for the arrival of spring,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Before celebrating Passover.</i> the establishment of a leap year was not in their hands. It rather depended on the Bet Din which, as is related in the Mishnah,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Really in the <i>Tosefta</i>. Cf. <i>Tosefta, Sanhedrin</i> 2:2.</i> looked for other things besides spring.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s Introduction to Vol. 1, p. 9. Also see <i>Sanhedrin</i>. 11b and <i>M.T., New Moon</i> 5:2, where Maimonides writes, “Intercalation of the year depended upon the following three criteria, the <i>tekufah</i>, the barley harvest, and the blooming of the tree fruits.”</i> Now Moses did not explain to us in the Torah how we should establish years or months. Neither did he tell us what we should do if we do not find it to be spring. One can pose a difficult question from all this, namely, why did Moses explain the laws of the plagues of the leper, which fall upon one person and do not last forever,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 13 and 14.</i> and leave out of the Torah the laws of the festivals<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The laws dealing with the establishment of the months wherein the festivals fall.

Furthermore, eating leaven on Passover and eating on the Day of Atonement are punished with excision. If Moses relied on the conjunction of the moon and sun he should have explained whether he meant according to the moon’s mean motion<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the mean conjunction. “The moment that the moon would have the same longitude as the sun, if both moved uniformly (Feldman, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 123; <i>M.T., New Moon</i> 6:1).</i> or its true conjunction,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">“The exact moment at which the centers of the sun and moon actually have precisely the same longitude” (Feldman, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 122).</i> which takes place opposite the sphere of the constellations, because at times there are approximately fourteen hours between the calculated conjunction<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The mean conjunction.</i> and the true conjunction. It is because of this that our holy fathers said, “At times it<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The true conjunction.</i> comes at longer intervals; at times it<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The true conjunction.</i> comes at shorter intervals.”<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 25a.</i> Only one who knows his way in the science of astronomy can know this. Additionally, Moses should have explained from which part of the earth we reckon the conjunction. For behold, between Jerusalem and this city, whose name is Lucca, there is more than three hours.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">In the time of sunrise (Krinsky, Weiser).

Cf. <i>M.T., New Moon</i> 9:12: “As to the solar year there are certain Jewish sages (viz., Samuel) who have held that it consists of 365 days and one quarter of a day, which is six hours.” According to the latter opinion, “There remains in each cycle of 19 solar years a balance of 1 hour and 485 parts.”</i> We know that this was not hidden from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel was aware of the imbalance.</i> Samuel only used a number which was close in his time to the men of his generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel employed a number which, while not a hundred percent accurate was close enough for the purposes of his time.</i> Today there is a difference of close to nine days<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The imbalance every 19 years between the real cycle and Samuel’s cycle has resulted in this much time accumulating from Samuel’s era to that of I.E.</i> between the true circuit<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Of the sun.</i> and Samuel’s circuit.

Hezekiah did three evils.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">If we accept the theory of those who disagree with our sages.</i> First of all, he did not offer the Passover sacrifice in its time<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">In the first month.</i> although he was ritually clean.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Those who are ritually unclean bring the Passover offering in the second month.

Far be it for Hezekiah to do such evil. Moreover, Scripture says of him that he did not turn aside to the right or left from the commandments of the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">II Chron. 18:6.

I will now explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Why and what Hezekiah did.</i> Know that Hezekiah took counsel with the entire congregation<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Of Jerusalem.

The fact that God plagued those who ate the paschal lamb in a manner contrary to what is written<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in a state of impurity. See II Chron. 30:18</i> is proof of this. If the Passover observed by Hezekiah was not celebrated in its proper time and was therefore not acceptable to the Lord,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">That is, God did not consider it a proper Passover offering.</i> why did He plague them?<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">For eating the paschal lamb in a state of impurity.</i> If Hezekiah sinned how is it that he prayed on their behalf<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">On behalf of those who ate the paschal lamb in a state of impurity.</i> and the Lord accepted his supplication and healed the people?<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">See II Chron. 30:20.</i> The answer to one who would argue that the sages of blessed memory did not maintain<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, admit.</i> that Hezekiah acted properly in adding another month during the month of Nisan<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis claim that Hezekiah acted improperly in calling Nisan Adar II after Nisan had already started.

It should be noted that the Torah does not explicitly refer to the first of Tishri as new year’s day.</i> The answer is that our sages of blessed memory have already noted<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">In tractate <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 2a.</i> that there are four new year days.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Each one of which serves a distinct purpose. The first of Nisan is the new year for festivals and kings. The first of Tishri is for the reckoning of years, of the year of release (<i>shimitah</i>) and the jubilee year. The first of Elul is the new year of the tithe of cattle, and the first of Shebat is for trees (so Beth Shammai, whereas Beth Hillel places it on the 15th of Shebat).</i> We clearly see that the sanctification of the jubilee year is <i>on the tenth day of the seventh month</i> (Lev. 25:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that the counting of the jubilee year starts in Tishri, not in Nisan.</i> Furthermore, God commanded that the Torah be read <i>in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles</i> (Deut. 31:10)…<i>that they may hear, and that they may learn</i> (Deut. 31:12). Now if the beginning of the year of release is reckoned from Nisan, why didn’t God command that the Torah be read during the festival of unleavened bread? Now they were idle for half a year.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">That is, half of the year of release, when one is prohibited from working the ground, would have passed by the time Sukkot arrived. The Torah connects the reading of the Torah with the year of release. If the year of release starts in Tishri then we can understand why the Torah is read in Tishri. However, if the new year starts in Nisan it makes no sense to read the Torah six months later.</i> Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>and the feast of ingathering</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the festival of Sukkot.</i> <i>at the turn of the year</i> (Ex. 34:22). <sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Sukkot falls in the month at which the year turns, that is, begins. This proves that Tishri is the start of a new year.</i> Elsewhere it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">With reference to the festival of Sukkot.</i> <i>at the end of the year</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in the month which marks the end of the old and the beginning of a new year. We thus have additional proof that the new year begins in Tishri.</i> <i>when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field</i> (Ex. 23:16). Additionally, we can derive the aforementioned<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">That the year of release begins in Tishri.</i> from the way the Torah speaks and from the way nature acts. The Torah first states,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the sabbatical year.</i> <i>ye shall not sow</i> and afterwards says, <i>neither</i> (shall ye) <i>reap</i> (Lev. 25:12). The season of sowing is close to Tishri,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">When the year of release begins.</i> not Nisan. Furthermore, if we reckon the beginning of the year of release from Nisan he who sowed in the sixth year<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">After Tishri.</i> will not harvest in the seventh year, because the harvest falls after Nisan when the year of release has already started.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he will not sow in the sixth year.</i> He will also not sow in the year of release.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">After Tishri. There will thus be two rather than one year of no sowing. However, Scripture only speaks of one year of no sowing.</i> We thus see that the words of our sages are correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">That the year of release and similarly the years in general start in Tishri.</i>
THE BEGINNING OF MONTHS. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 2:2 and the notes thereto.</i> says that there is no need to use the term <i>rosh chodesh</i> (new moon). The term <i>chodesh</i> suffices,<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>chodesh</i> means the first day of the month. It does not mean month. Such terms as <i>esrim la-chodesh</i>, usually translated as the 20th of the month, really mean 20 days from the new moon.</i> since the meaning of <i>chodesh</i> is the day that the light of the moon is renewed. Scripture thus states, <i>chodesh ve-shabbat</i> (New moon and sabbath) (Is. 1:13); <i>chodshekhem u-mo’adekhem</i> (your new moons and your appointed seasons) (Is. 1:14); <i>mi-de chodesh be-chodsho</i> (from one new moon to another) (Is. 66:23). Others argued with him and asked, if this be the case, then why does Scripture state, <i>ba-chodesh hashe’vi’i be-echad la-chodesh</i> (And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month) (Num. 29:1)?<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>chodesh</i> means the first day of the month, why does Scripture go on to say: on the first day of the month? Thus <i>chodesh</i> must mean month.</i> Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen answered, to remove doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to be especially precise.</i> They also quoted, <i>u-ve-roshe chodshekhem</i> (and in your new moons) (Num. 28:11) against him.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture should have read, <i>u-ve-chodshekhem</i> (<i>chodshekhem</i> is the plural of <i>chodesh</i> plus the personal pronoun).</i> He answered that Scripture speaks of the month of Nisan throughout the years,<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>u-ve-roshe chodshekhem</i> does not mean, and in your new moons, but rather: and in your chief new moons, that is, every new moon of the month of Nisan.</i> for only Nisan is the chief new moon.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Roshe chodshekhem</i> can be translated as your new moons or your chief new moons. Rabbi Moses insists that the latter is the correct rendition.</i> They then asked him, if so, then what sacrifices are we to offer on other new moons?<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">If Num. 28:11-15 deals only with the sacrifices to be offered on the new moon of Nisan, then what sacrifices are to be offered on other new moons?</i> He answered that Scripture states in the very same portion, <i>This is the burnt-offering of every new moon throughout the months of the year</i> (Num. 28:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the same sacrifice that is offered on the new moon of Nisan is to be offered on all other new moons.</i> Scripture likewise states, <i>Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons</i> (u-ve-roshe chodshekhem),<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">The reference being to the first of Nisan. Here too <i>roshe chodshekhem</i> means the chief of your new moons.</i> <i>ye shall blow with the trumpets</i> (Num. 10:10) because it is the beginning of the year.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the Torah commands us to sound trumpets on the first day of Nisan.</i> However, we<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to Rabbi Moses.</i> will not set aside the words of our rabbis of blessed memory because of our own opinions. Our sages said that we sound the trumpets on the new moon of every month.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 55a.</i> It is correct to say <i>chodesh</i> or <i>rosh chodesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">When referring to a new moon, since <i>chodesh</i> can either mean new moon or a month.</i> It is written, <i>ad chodesh yamim</i> (but a whole month) (Num. 11:20), the meaning of which is: until the days of the month are complete.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that <i>chodesh</i> does not necessarily mean a new moon but that it also means a month.</i>

Verse 5

YOUR LAMB SHALL BE WITHOUT BLEMISH. It shall be without any deformity. The word <i>seh</i> (lamb) also applies to the two kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Not only does the term <i>tzon</i> take in two kinds but the word <i>seh</i> also takes in two kinds.</i> taken in by the term <i>tzon</i> (flock).<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to sheep and goats, as is explicitly stated in our verse, namely, <i>ye shall take it</i> (the seh) <i>from the sheep, or from the goats</i>.</i> <i>Sehkhevasim ve-seh izzim</i> (the sheep and the goat) (Deut. 14:4) is similar. Rabbi Moses ben Amram Ha-Parsi<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">A Karaite commentator on the Bible.</i> says that the obligation to offer a lamb only pertains to the Passover brought in Egypt. However, in the Land of Israel one could sacrifice a lamb or a bull. He offers as proof, <i>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God, of the flock and the herd</i> (Deut. 16:2), which applies to the Passover to be offered in all future generations. However, he did not speak correctly. All future Passover offerings are in memory of the paschal lamb offered in Egypt, and one should not deviate from it. The meaning of the aforementioned verse can only be: <i>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God of the flock</i> as an obligation; <i>and of the herd</i>, bring peace offerings to be eaten cooked in water. Similarly, <i>And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter</i> (Deut. 16:14) means thou art obligated;<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">To come to the temple on a pilgrimage and rejoice before the Lord.</i> thy son and thy daughter are permitted to do so. Proof of the above is found in the book of Chronicles.<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">II Chron. 35: 1-13.</i> We read there that on the fourteenth day<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Of the first month.</i> they slaughtered lambs and bullocks.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">II Chron. 35:1.</i> It is written there that the lambs were for Passover offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 35:7.</i> and the bullocks which served as peace offerings were cooked in pots and caldrons.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> Only those sacrifices which came from the flock were roasted in the fire according to ordinance.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> Rabbi Joshua says that there is a difference between <i>ben shanah</i> (of the first year)<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse states that the paschal lamb is to be a <i>ben shanah</i>.</i> and <i>ben shenato</i> (of the first year). A <i>ben shanah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a lamb that is a <i>ben shanah</i>.</i> has lived a year and <i>ben shenato</i> means exactly what Scripture says.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ben shenato</i> literally means of its year, i.e., during its first year of life.</i> Now with regard to the sacrifices offered by the princes it first states, <i>keves echad ben shenato leolah</i> (one he-lamb of the first year, for a burnt-offering) (Num. 7:15) and then states, <i>kevasim bene shanah</i> (he-lambs of the first year) (Num. 7:87).<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells us that each one of the princes of the tribes of Israel offered a <i>keves ben shenato</i> for a burnt offering. Scripture then gives the number of burnt offerings as <i>kevasim bene shanah shenem asar</i> (he-lambs of the first year twelve). We thus see that the terms <i>ben shanah</i> and <i>ben shenato</i> are one and the same. Therefore Rabbi Joshua is incorrect. I might add that both Krinsky and Weiser missed I.E.’s point. Both indicate that I.E.’s proof is from the five he-lambs of the first year (<i>bene shanah</i>) brought as peace offerings. However, there is no proof from the latter because the peace offering differs from the burnt offering, and one can argue that Scripture required a lamb under a year for a burnt offering and a lamb over a year for a peace offering.</i>

Verse 6

AND YE SHALL KEEP IT. Each one shall keep it in his house.
AT DUSK. <i>Ben ha-arbayim</i> (at dusk) is a difficult phrase. Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi. Rashi writes on Ex. 12:6 that from six hours (noon) and upwards is termed <i>ben ha-arbayim</i>.</i> says that it refers to the moment after midday that the sun moves to the west. He does not explain why <i>arbayim</i> is in the dual form.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Actually Rashi does explain. He writes, “It appears to me that the term <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> refers to those hours between the darkening of the day (<i>arivat ha-yom</i>, i.e., when the sun begins its descent) and the darkening of the night (<i>arivat ha-laylah</i>, i.e., when night starts). The day darkens at the start of the seventh hour…and the night begins to darken at the beginning of the night.” Hence according to Rashi, <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> means between the two evenings (or darkenings). I.E. probably quoted from memory. I doubt that I.E.’s manuscript of Rashi differed from ours.</i> Now, Scripture states, <i>And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at dusk</i> (ben ha-arbayim) (Ex. 30:8), and there is no doubt that Aaron is to light the lamps when the sun sets.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 27:21. We thus see, contra Rashi, that <i>ben arbayim</i> does not refer to a moment after midday.</i> Now, when we researched this phrase we found that Scripture refers to the moment of <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> as <i>erev</i> (evening).<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains later on.</i> For it is clearly written, <i>At dusk</i> (ben ha-arbayim) <i>ye shall eat flesh</i> (Ex. 16:12), and it is there stated, <i>when the Lord shall give you in the evening</i> (ba-erev) <i>flesh to eat</i> (Ex. 16:8). Likewise, concerning the lighting of the lamps it is written: <i>Aaron and his sons shall set it in order, to burn from evening</i> (erev) <i>to morning before the Lord</i> (Ex. 27:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">This verse proves that <i>erev</i> means the same as <i>ben ha-arbayim</i>, as this verse is parallel to Ex. 30:8.</i> It is similarly written, <i>even burnt-offerings mornings and evening</i> (erev) (Ezra 3:3), and it is stated, <i>The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk</i> (ben ha-arbayim) (Ex. 29:39). Now concerning the Passover sacrifice, about which the term <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> (at dusk) is employed, we find that Scripture states, <i>there thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering at even</i> (erev), <i>at the coming</i> (bo)<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> <i>of the sun, at the season that thou earnest forth out of Egypt</i> (Deut. 16:6). Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i> explains that the reference is to the time that the sun comes to the west.<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">This is not actually said by Rashi. What I.E. means is that according to Rashi, Deut. 16:6 must be interpreted in this way.</i> However, this is not the meaning of <i>bo</i>. It refers to the opposite of the sun’s going forth upon the earth<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>bo ha-shemesh</i> means the setting of the sun.</i> since it is written, <i>the sun went out</i> (yatza) <i>upon the earth</i> (Gen. 19:23),<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> which means the time that the sun first begins to be seen on the earth. Similarly, <i>And when the sun comes</i> (ba) <i>he shall be clean</i><sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Lev. 22:7) means when the sun shall no longer be seen upon the ground. Now it is written concerning a nocturnal seminal emission, <i>But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun comes</i> (u-khe-vo ha-shemesh)<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">That is, goes down, since the first part of the verse speaks of <i>when evening cometh</i>.</i> <i>he may come within the camp</i><sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Only the first part of the verse appears in the text of I.E. However, since his main proof is from the second part, the entire verse is inserted into the translation and translated literally.</i> (Deut. 23:12). If this is not so, then let Rabbi Solomon explain what difference there is between “when the sun comes” with regard to Passover and “when the sun comes” with regard to a nocturnal seminal emission. It is the same with <i>and when the sun comes he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">One who is ritually impure.</i> <i>shall be clean</i> (Lev. 22:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">If he has immersed himself. Let Rashi explain why <i>when the sun comes</i> with regard to Passover means a moment after midday and why <i>when the sun comes</i> with regard to the laws of ritual purity means after sunset.</i> The Sadducees<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">A term used for heretics and here meaning the Karaites.</i> say that there are three evenings.<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">When the sun begins to set, while it is setting, when it fully sets (Krinsky).</i> Their proof is from a verse which they found to read, <i>ha-erev ha-shelishit</i> (the third evening)<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. They interpret this to refer to the final setting of the sun.</i> (I Sam. 20:5). However, they do not recognize or understand the truth. It is written, <i>Tomorrow is the new moon…And in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well</i> (I Sam. 20:18, 19), the meaning of which is: when close to evening of the third day starting from today comes, you shall hide yourself well in the field where you are presently hidden. It is because of this that Jonathan said, <i>until the third evening</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ad ha-erev ha-shelishit</i> does not mean until the third of the day’s three evenings arrives but rather the evening of the third day arrives. See note 213.</i> I will now backtrack and explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">What <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> means.</i> Know that the word <i>arbayim</i> is always vocalized according to the paradigm of the dual forms like <i>ovnayim</i> (birthstool) (Ex. 1:16). <i>Luchotayim</i> (planks) (Ezek. 27:5) is similar. So is <i>derachayim</i> (ways) (Prov. 28:18), as <i>But he that is perverse in his ways</i> (derachayim) <i>shall fall in one of them</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>) proves.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote"><i>One of them</i> refers to <i>derachayim</i>. This shows that <i>derachayim</i> is a dual form and refers to two.

I have already explained in <i>The Book of God</i>, the Glorious,<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer Hashem</i>, chap. 1 in <i>Yalkut Ibn Ezra</i>, edited by I. Levin, Israel, 1985.</i> that the word <i>shamayim</i> comes from the same root as the word <i>sham</i> (there) in <i>There the upright might reason with Him</i> (Job 23:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. here contradicts what he wrote in Gen. 1:1, where he connects <i>shamayim</i> to the Arabic word <i>sammah</i> (high).</i> The term <i>shamayim</i> alludes to these two places.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">The places where the aforementioned two poles one in the north and one in the south, are fixed.

[LINTEL.] The word <i>mashkof</i> (lintel) means a window.<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">Contra Rashi, who explains <i>mashkof</i> as a lintel, namely, “the upper beam against which the door strikes when one closes it.” Rashi compares <i>mashkof</i> to the Aramaic words <i>shakef</i> (struck) and <i>mashkofe</i> (blow).</i> Compare, <i>va-yashkef</i> (looked) (Gen. 26:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">It is called a <i>mashkof</i> because one looks through it.</i> This window was in the door.<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">The blood was to serve as a sign that the destroyer was not to enter the house via the door.</i> This is the custom in all Moslem countries. The practice of the uncircumcised<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">The Christians among whom I.E. was living when he wrote this commentary. Windows were apparently not placed in doors in Christian Europe in I.E’s lifetime, hence the need to point out that they were in ancient Egypt.</i> differs from that of the Egyptians<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Egypt was and is a Moslem country. I.E. assumed that the practices of medieval Egypt were the same as those of ancient Egypt.</i> even regarding food,<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">How much more does it differ with regard to the construction of houses. People in the Middle Ages generally did not travel and were uninformed in these matters, hence I.E.’s comments.</i> an example being, <i>Thou shalt break it in pieces</i> (Lev. 2:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is not clear. Weiser suggests that I.E. wants to point out that the bread in Moslem countries is different from the bread in Christian countries. In Moslem countries people eat a flat bread (pitta). The Hebrew word for pieces is <i>pittim</i>. Thus <i>pittim</i> (pieces of pitta) shows that the bread eaten by the two cultures is different. Or, Lev. 2:6 speaks of bread baked in a pan. Europeans do not make bread in that manner. We thus see that different peoples have different food habits.</i> Similarly with regard to women’s jewelry such as the wearing of nose rings and earrings and all that the prophet Isaiah mentioned concerning the daughters of Zion (Is. 3:18-24).<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Women in Moslem countries still wear those type of ornaments while women in Christian countries do not.</i> Likewise, all of their houses<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">And similarly those of ancient Egypt.</i> without exception are built in courtyards. One entrance is called the door to the house and the other the gate of the courtyard. Many say that the purpose of placing the blood on the window and on the two side-posts was to demonstrate publicly that they slaughtered the abomination of Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Their god. See <i>Mekhilta</i> 6, “<i>On the two side-posts and on the lintel</i>. Rabbi Isaac says…on the outside, so that the Egyptians, seeing it, would be cut to the quick.” The <i>Shulkhan Arukh</i> uses a similar reason for Shabbat Ha-Gadol. See <i>Orech Chayyim</i> 430:1.</i> since by then the fear of the Israelites had fallen on the Egyptians, and the Israelites were not afraid of being stoned.<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 9:22.</i> Now if this was the case then the blood should have been placed on the entrance to the courtyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Where it would be visible to all. Therefore I.E. disagrees with this theory and goes on to explain what he thinks occurred.</i> However, the blood was placed in secret, for they closed the gate of the courtyard. Furthermore, they slaughtered the lamb at dusk, which is close to night, so that no one would see them. Moreover, no man left his house until the morning when each one went on his way and each one closed the gate to his courtyard. The Egyptians thought that the Israelites would return.<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">That is why they gave them permission to leave. Thus there was no point in antagonizing the Egyptians or giving them any reason to suspect that they were not returning. Indeed, once the Egyptians learned that the Israelites were not returning they pursued them and tried to bring them back. See I.E. on Ex. 14:5.</i> The reason the blood was smeared on the window was to make atonement<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">For one’s sins, as the blood which is sprinkled on the altar does.</i> for all those eating in the house and to serve as a mark for the destroyer<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">The angel of death.</i> to see. It is to be understood in the same way as <i>and set a mark on the foreheads of the men</i> (Ezek. 9:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">So that they will not be harmed when destruction comes to the city.</i>
[HOUSES.] The word <i>battim</i> (houses) is grammatically irregular, as it has a <i>dagesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>tav</i>.</i> following a long <i>kamatz</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Beneath the <i>bet</i>.</i> This is contrary to the rule<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">For a <i>dagesh</i> is not placed in a letter that follows a consonant vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>.</i> whereby a <i>dagesh</i> is only placed after a short <i>kamatz</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kamatz katan</i>.</i> as in <i>ronnu</i> (sing)<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">Wherein the <i>resh</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz katan</i>, and a <i>dagesh</i>, is placed in the <i>resh</i>.</i> in <i>Sing, O ye heavens</i> (Is. 44:23). Perhaps <i>battim</i> was vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>battim</i> (houses) should have been vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>bet</i>. Hence there is a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>tav</i>.</i> because of the missing <i>yod</i> in the word <i>bayit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">The singular of <i>battim</i> is <i>bayit</i>. The <i>yod</i> drops out in the plural. Now if the yod were retained there would be no chance of confusing our word with <i>battim</i> meaning baths because our word would have been pronounced <i>beyatim</i>. However, since the <i>yod</i> drops out in the plural, if both words were identically vocalized one could confuse them.</i> This form<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Battim</i> (houses), the plural of <i>bayit</i>.</i> would thus not be confused with the form <i>battim</i> (baths) in <i>ten baths are a homer</i> (Ezek. 45:14) wherein <i>battim</i>, the plural of <i>bat</i> (bath) in <i>The ephah and the bath</i> (Ezek. 45:11), is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> in the plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the vocalization of the word <i>battim</i>, meaning houses, was changed from a <i>pattach</i> to a <i>kamatz</i>.</i> The word <i>battim</i> (houses) in <i>upon the houses</i> is indicative,<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>battim</i> is irregular (Filwarg). Or that its <i>kamatz</i> is not a “real” <i>kamatz</i> (Krinsky). Or that it indicates why in this word a <i>dagesh</i> follows a <i>kamatz</i> (Weiser).</i> for unlike the rule it is penultimately accented.<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that its <i>kamatz</i> is not a “real” <i>kamatz</i>. If it were, then <i>battim</i> would be ultimately accented (Krinsky). Or it shows that a <i>dagesh</i> may follow after an accented <i>kamatz</i>. Compare, <i>nashattah</i> (faileth) in Is. 41:17 (Weiser). It should be noted that <i>battim</i> is found penultimately accented only in our verse. Elsewhere in Scripture it is always ultimately accented.</i>

Verse 8

WITH BITTER HERBS THEY SHALL EAT IT. One of the Spanish wise men explained that it is well known that because of the Nile and the lack of rain, the humidity in Egypt is very high and the air is always moist. It was therefore their custom to eat all sorts of bitter herbs and mustards with their meals. An Egyptian always had bitters in which to dip his bread, even if he had but one loaf of bread, because the bitters are a cure for their climate.<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Hence God commanded the Israelites to eat bitter herbs with the paschal lamb.</i> However, we will rely on the opinion of our ancients of blessed memory, who explained to us that the reason for the bitter herbs is to remind us that <i>they made their lives bitter</i> (Ex. 1:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 116b.</i>

Verse 9

RAW. Some say that the meaning of <i>na</i> (raw) is: as it is now,<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>na</i> means now. See I.E. on Gen. 12:11, “<i>Na</i> means now. <i>Na</i> in <i>behold now</i> (na), <i>I am old</i> (Gen. 27.2), and <i>Woe now</i> (na) <i>unto us</i> (Lam. 5:16) are similar.”</i> i.e., when the meat is raw. However, we do not find the word <i>na</i> used in such a way elsewhere in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">It is so used in reference to time but not with regard to an object. While I.E. rejects the interpretation here, he accepts it in his short commentary.</i> Others say<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Menachem ben Saruk (Krinsky).</i> that it comes from the same root as <i>heni</i> (breaks)<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>nun, vav, ayin</i>.</i> in <i>But if her father breaks her vow</i> (Num. 30:6) and means broken.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that one is prohibited from breaking a bone in the paschal lamb.</i> However, this is incorrect, as Scripture later states, <i>neither shall ye break a bone thereof</i> (v. 46).<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">Why would Scripture repeat itself?</i> However, in my opinion the word <i>na</i><sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">As used in this context.</i> has no counterpart in Scripture. It means the opposite of cooked and is<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">Elsewhere.</i> referred to as <i>chai</i> (raw). Compare, <i>For he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw</i> (chai) (I Sam. 2:15). I have previously noted that most of Arabic is similar to Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">Hence we may learn the meaning of Hebrew words from their Arabic cognates.</i> Now in Arabic raw meat is called <i>nayy</i>, and the <i>alef heh, vav</i>, and <i>yod</i> interchange in the tongue of the Arabs as it does in our tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>nun yod</i> equals <i>nun alef</i>.</i>
NOR SODDEN. <i>Bashel</i> (sodden) is an adjective. Here its meaning is, that which is sodden with water.<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture reads, <i>u-vashel mevushal ba-mayim</i> (nor sodden at all with water), which literally means, nor boiled, boiled in water.</i> That which is roasted in fire is also called <i>mevushal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the modifying phrase <i>mevushal ba-mayim</i> (boiled in water).</i> for it is written, <i>And thou shalt roast</i> (u-vishalta)<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">Here <i>bashel</i> refers to roasting, as it is forbidden to cook the paschal lamb in water.</i> <i>and eat it</i> (Deut. 16:7) and, <i>And they roasted</i> (va-yevashelu)<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">See note 277.</i> <i>the passover with fire according to the ordinance</i> (II Chron. 35:13). It is possible that <i>nor sodden at all with water</i><sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, boiled, boiled in water. If Scripture wanted to lay down the law that the paschal lamb should not be eaten cooked in water it should have said <i>u-mevushal ba-mayim</i> (nor boiled in water). Why be redundant and write <i>u-vashel mevushal ba-mayim</i>, and boiled, boiled in water.</i> means nor cooked, that is, cooked in water, as a royal dish is sodden in liquids. They place a wide copper utensil on the fire and fill half of it with water. When the water boils they place the pot with the meat in cold water above the boiling water. Thus is the meat cooked.<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">There are thus two acts of boiling. Hence Scripture employs two terms, <i>bashel</i> and <i>mevushal</i>.</i> This dish is better than one prepared close to the fire. I the writer<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">The copyist of the manuscript.</i> add to the words of this scholar what I heard from his very own mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">The copyist was obviously a student of Ibn Ezra.</i> <i>Bashel</i> (sodden)<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>u-vashel</i>.</i> is an adjective<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Not an infinitive. Our word is not to be confused with the <i>pi’el</i> infinitive <i>bashel</i> (cf. <i>le-vashel</i>, to cook), as the infinitive form is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> and has a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>shin</i> (compare the <i>pi’el</i> infinitive <i>dabber</i>).</i> following the paradigm of <i>kaved</i> (heavy) and <i>zaken</i> (old). The term <i>bashel</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>u-vashel</i>.</i> here is similar,<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">To <i>kaved</i> and <i>zaken</i>.</i> as its <i>bet</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the <i>bet</i> of <i>bashel</i> in the infinitive (see note 284) but like the <i>kof</i> of <i>kaved</i> and the <i>zayin</i> of <i>zaken</i>.</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> and its <i>shin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the <i>shin</i> of <i>bashel</i> in the infinitive (see note 284) but like the <i>bet</i> of <i>kaved</i> and the <i>kof</i> of <i>zaken</i>.</i> has no <i>dagesh. Bashel</i> is not an infinitive<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">See note 284.</i> like <i>kabbed</i> (promote) in <i>for I will promote thee</i> (Num. 22:17) or <i>hakkeh</i> (smite) in <i>thou shalt surely smite</i> (Deut. 13:16), as the infinitive is not joined to a word unless it is a perfect or an imperfect. Compare, <i>dabber yedabber</i> (speak well) (Ex. 4:14),<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dabber</i> is an infinitive, <i>yedabber</i> an imperfect. <i>Dabber yedabber</i> (speak well) literally means speak, he will speak.</i> and <i>hakdesh hikdashti</i> (I verily dedicate) (Jud. 17:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hakdesh</i> is an infinitive, <i>hikdashti</i> a perfect. <i>Hakdesh hikdashti</i> (I verily dedicate) literally means dedicate, I dedicated.</i> However, the infinitive is never joined with the <i>po’el</i> or <i>pa’ul</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote">With the active or passive participle form. However, it is in <i>bashel mevushal</i>, as <i>mevushal</i> is a <i>pu’al</i> participle. Hence the term <i>bashel</i> in <i>bashel mevushal</i> cannot be an infinitive.</i> Thus <i>bashel</i> (sodden) is similar to <i>kaved</i> (heavy).<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">It is an adjective as <i>kaved</i> is.</i> Its feminine form is <i>beshelah</i>, as in <i>the shoulder…when it is sodden</i> (beshelah) (Num. 6:19). Do not ask what need Scripture had to use the two terms <i>bashel</i> and <i>mevushal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">See note 279.</i> As the scholar<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra.</i> pointed out,<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">Above.</i> there are two soddenings, one of which is<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the one is. If we do not interpret it to mean: one of which is, then along with Weiser we must assume that of one of the steps in the copyist’s description of the two-stage cooking process was lost.</i> the placing of the utensil with the meat in the midst of the boiling water. The plural of <i>bashel mevushal</i> is <i>beshelim mevushalim</i>. Compare, <i>chakhamim mechukkamim</i> (exceeding wise) in <i>But they are exceeding wise</i> (Prov. 30:24). The singular form is <i>chakham mechukkam</i>. Compare, <i>barukh u-mevorakh</i> (exceedingly blessed). There is a difference in nuance from a grammatical standpoint between <i>chakham</i> (a wise man) and <i>mechukkam</i> (one who has become wise).<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">The copyist comments thus because earlier he compared the plural form of <i>bashel mevushal</i> to the plural form of <i>chakham mechukkam. Chakham</i> means a wise man. <i>Mechukkam</i> means one who has been made wise (taught) by others. See I.E. on Prov. 30:24, “<i>Mechukkamim:</i> God gave them the wisdom to do this.”</i> There is, as the scholar explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. in his opening comment on this verse.</i> a similar difference between <i>bashel</i> (sodden)<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">Which means boiled (cooked).</i> and <i>mevushal</i> (sodden).<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">Which means was cooked (boiled). Hence <i>bashel, mevushal ba-mayim</i>, boiled, boiled in water. The difference between <i>bashel</i> and <i>mevushal</i> is explained by I.E. in his opening comment on this verse.</i>
ITS HEAD WITH ITS LEGS AND WITH THE INWARDS THEREOF. The word <i>al</i> has the meaning of with.<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">Not on, its usual meaning. Hence <i>rosho al kera’av ve’al kirbo</i> means: its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof, not its head on its legs and on the inwards thereof.</i> The word <i>al</i> in <i>And they came, both men and</i> (al) <i>women</i> (Ex. 35:22) is similar. The head and the legs are to be washed in water<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">Before roasting, although not stated here.</i> as the ordinance requires.<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Pesachim</i> 74a.</i>

Verse 10

BUT THAT WHICH REMAINETH OF IT…BURN WITH FIRE. If one was unable to eat one’s portion due to circumstances beyond one’s control. Yefet says that the reference is to the bones. However, Scripture only speaks of what is normal.<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">When people eat some meat and not only bones remain uneaten.</i>

Verse 11

AND THUS SHALL YE EAT IT. The reference is only to the paschal lamb eaten in Egypt. However, those in Argalon<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is unclear. Some identify it with a place in Algeria (Weiser).</i> do the same today in memory of the Exodus. These spiritual errants all leave their land on the fifteenth day in memory of the Exodus.
AND YOUR STAFF IN YOUR HAND. To lead the asses.<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">They did not leave on foot, as they were setting out on a long journey. Hence the staffs in their hands were not for walking.</i> Compare, <i>and he smote the ass with his staff</i> (Num. 22:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Balaam was then riding an ass. Thus the staff in his hand was not a walking stick but rather a rod with which to guide the ass.</i>
[IN HASTE.] Israel was not to delay.<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">Eating the paschal lamb.</i> They were to hurry and eat the paschal lamb before the moment of destruction arrived,<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">When God would destroy the first-born of Egypt.</i> when God would pass over their homes.<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, so that they could begin their departure from the land of Egypt immediately after being freed. They could not have done this if they had been busy eating the paschal lamb.</i> God therefore commanded that the lamb be roasted in fire, because food that is roasted cooks quickly. The holy patriarchs<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis of the Talmud.</i> similarly said the paschal lamb may be eaten only until midnight and it may only be eaten roasted.<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 56a.</i>

Verse 12

FOR I WILL GO THROUGH THE LAND OF EGYPT. God’s might and His power passed throughout the land. Hence it was as if God Himself went throughout the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>I will go through the land</i> is not to be taken literally. It means My might and power will go through the land.</i>
AND AGAINST ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS. In the manner of <i>Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground</i> (I Sam. 5:4). It is similarly written, <i>upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments</i> (Num. 33:4).

Verse 13

AND THE BLOOD SHALL BE TO YOU FOR A TOKEN. This<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote">Blood.</i> shall be for you a token so that your hearts will be strong and will not weaken as you hear the cries of the Egyptians when their first-born die via the destroyer. [AND WHEN I SEE THE BLOOD.] I will pass over you and there will be no plague among you because I will see the blood. The blood will be a sign to the destroyer.<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, on or concerning the destroyer.</i>

Verse 14

AND THIS DAY SHALL BE UNTO YOU. It shall be a memorial for generations.
AND YE SHALL KEEP IT A FEAST. The reference is to the feast of Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the offering of the paschal lamb.</i> Scripture says that it shall be kept a feast by an ordinance throughout your generations. However, it does not say that it is to be kept in all of your dwelling places, because this commandment is, as I will explain, contingent on dwelling in the Land of Israel.

Verse 15

SEVEN DAYS SHALL YE EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD. The reason for <i>shall ye eat unleavened bread</i> is to recall the <i>matzot</i> eaten when they left Egypt. They were not previously commanded to eat unleavened bread save for that which is to be eaten with the paschal lamb before midnight.<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs…</i>(v. 8).</i> However, God now commanded that they eat unleavened bread for seven days<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">Throughout the generations.</i> in memory of what happened to them when they left Egypt, as it is written there,<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">In the description of the Exodus.</i> <i>for it was not leavened</i> (Ex. 12:39). Had the Egyptians permitted them to tarry a bit, they would have leavened their dough. They ate unleavened bread for seven days until Pharaoh was drowned on the seventh day. The heavenly cloud led them day and night and they did not tarry very long even when they camped.<sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote">They therefore had no time to bake leavened bread.</i> It is similarly written when discussing the paschal lamb,<sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote">Which is to be eaten in all generations.</i> <i>seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction</i> (Deut. 16:3). Now according to its plain meaning, the text <i>Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread</i> is stating an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">323</sup><i class="footnote">Contra the Talmudic opinion that the obligation to eat unleavened bread is limited to the first night of Passover. See <i>Pesachim</i> 120a. Also see Rashi on this verse.</i> <i>That thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life</i> (Deut. 16:3) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">324</sup><i class="footnote">Just as remembering the Exodus all the days is an obligation, so is eating <i>matzot</i> for seven days an obligation, since both are written in one verse.</i> It is because of this<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">It is because Scripture connected the obligation to eat unleavened bread with the paschal lamb, which is only offered in the Land of Israel.</i> that Scripture states, <i>Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread</i> (Ex. 12:20), as the latter<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">Abstaining from leavened bread and eating unleavened bread.</i> is an obligation within the Land of Israel and outside of the Land of Israel.
[HOWBEIT THE FIRST DAY YE SHALL PUT AWAY LEAVEN OUT OF YOUR HOUSES.] Now since Israel had a tradition of commencing the slaughter of the paschal lamb when the sun started going down towards the west, and it is written, <i>Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread</i> (Ex. 34:25), the rabbis of blessed memory interpreted the word <i>ach</i> (howbeit) to mean a part of.<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 5a. It is a general principle in Talmudic exegesis that <i>ach</i> and <i>rak</i> imply limitations. Thus <i>ach</i> divides the day, indicating that the putting away of the leaven is to take place in the middle of the day. According to the rabbis, <i>ach ba-yom ha-rishon tashbitu se’or mi-batekhem</i> (howbeit the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses) is to be rendered: At the middle of the day which is before the festival of unleavened bread ye shall put away leaven out of your houses.</i> Mark the fact that ceasing an act is not an act. The meaning of <i>And on the seventh day God finished</i> (Gen. 2:2) is: when the seventh day started God had already finished his work.<sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 2:2.</i> Similarly, the meaning of <i>the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses</i> is: when the first day starts, all leaven shall already have been removed from the houses. Now <i>the first day</i> starts at the end of the fourteenth day at even, as it is written, <i>from the first day until the seventh day</i>. The meaning of the phrase<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote">Howbeit on <i>the first day</i>, etc.</i> then is that the seven full days<sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in the opening of our verse.</i> are from the fourteenth day of the month at even, which is the end of the fourteenth day, until the twenty-first day at even. I will yet speak concerning this.

Verse 16

AND IN THE FIRST DAY. The day of the Exodus from Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">331</sup><i class="footnote">The 15th of Nisan.</i> The seventh day is, as I will explain, the day that the Egyptians drowned.
NO MANNER OF WORK. We do not find the phrase <i>kol melakhah</i> (no manner of work) stated with regard to any of the festivals,<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">In Lev. 23 and Num. 28 and 29 Scripture prohibits one from “working” on the festivals. The formula used is <i>kol melekhet avodah lo ta’asu</i> (ye shall do no manner of servile work). See Lev. 23:8, 21, 25, 35; 36.

[HAVE I BROUGHT.] Scripture reads, <i>have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt</i> although they had not yet left Egypt.

Verse 18

IN THE FIRST. Scripture uses an abridged form since it had already stated, <i>it shall be the first month of the year to you</i> (v. 2). The meaning of <i>in the first</i> thus is, in the first month. <i>In the tenth, on the first day of the month</i> (Gen. 8:5)<sup class="footnote-marker">349</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">350</sup><i class="footnote"><i>In the tenth</i> is short for: in the tenth month.</i>

Verse 19

LEAVEN. <i>Se’or</i> (leaven) refers to something which induces leavening. The substance is well known.<sup class="footnote-marker">351</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. could find no Hebrew synonym for <i>se’or</i>.</i> Scripture then goes on to say, <i>for whosoever eateth anything which is leavened</i> (machmetzet).<sup class="footnote-marker">352</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>machmetzet</i> refers to anything which is leavened. Scripture first prohibits keeping anything which induces leavening (<i>se’or</i>) in one’s home on Passover. It then prohibits eating on Passover anything which is leavened.</i> Note that <i>from the first day until the seventh day</i> (v. 15) is not connected to what is adjacent, i.e., to <i>shall be cut off</i><sup class="footnote-marker">353</sup><i class="footnote">The second part of verse 15 literally reads: For whosoever eateth leavened bread that soul shall be cut off from Israel from the first day to the seventh day. I.E. argues that we should not read the verse in this manner; that is, <i>from the first day</i>, etc., does not follow <i>shall be cut off</i>.</i> but rather is connected to<sup class="footnote-marker">354</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains that we are to connect <i>For whosoever eateth leavened bread</i> to <i>from the first day</i>, etc., and read verse 15 as if written: For whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</i> <i>for whosoever eateth leavened bread</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">355</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to the eating of that which is leavened. There is either an error in the text (Weiser, Filwarg) or, more likely, I.E. paraphrased.</i> It is similar to <i>of Solomon’s reign over Israel</i> (I Kings 6:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">356</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 2 and note 58.</i> Yefet says that some letters refer both to the word in which they are placed and to a word previously written, as in <i>odem pitdah u-vareket</i> (carnelian, topaz, and smaragd) (Ex. 28:17), which is to be interpreted as if written, <i>odem u-pitdah u-vareket</i> (carnelian, <span class="underline">and</span> topaz, and smaragd).<sup class="footnote-marker">357</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>vav</i> (and) placed in front of <i>vareket</i> also governs <i>pitdah</i>.</i> The same is true of <i>mi-yom ha-rishon ad yom ha-shevi’i</i> (from the first day until the seventh day).<sup class="footnote-marker">358</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i> placed before <i>ha-rishon</i> also governs the word <i>yom</i> that precedes it. So too the <i>heh</i> placed before <i>ha-shevi’i</i> governs the word <i>yom</i> that precedes it. The verse is thus to be understood as if written: <i>me-<span class="underline">ha</span>-yom ha-rishon ad <span class="underline">ha</span>-yom ha-shevi’i</i>. Yefet comments thus for it is Hebrew style to place a <i>heh</i> in front of the noun when there is one in front of the adjective. Compare, <i>ha-har ha-tov</i> (that goodly hill country) (Deut. 3:25) (Filwarg). See also Vol. 1, p. 47, note 168.</i>
[WHETHER HE BE A SOJOURNER.] Scripture already noted that whosoever <i>eateth leavened bread</i> from among the Israelites incurs the penalty of excision.<sup class="footnote-marker">359</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 15.</i> Scripture now adds a sojourner who is a sincere proselyte.<sup class="footnote-marker">360</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is not being redundant in repeating the prohibition of eating leaven on Passover and the punishment for doing so.</i>

Verse 20

NOTHING LEAVENED. Scripture first mentions the punishment<sup class="footnote-marker">361</sup><i class="footnote">For eating leaven on Passover in verse 19.</i> and then the warning.<sup class="footnote-marker">362</sup><i class="footnote">Not to do so in verse 20.</i> <i>In all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread</i> is not optional as <i>Six days shall work be done</i> (Ex. 35:2) is. On the contrary, it is an obligation so that one will remember.<sup class="footnote-marker">363</sup><i class="footnote">The Exodus.</i>

Verse 21

AND MOSES CALLED FOR ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL. So that they would tell the people.
AND TAKE YOU LAMBS. On the tenth day, as he was commanded by God.<sup class="footnote-marker">364</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i>
[AND KILL THE PASSOVER LAMB.] The grammarian<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah ibn Janach in his <i>Sefer Ha-Shorashim</i>.(Weiser).</i> says that <i>ve-shachatu</i> (and kill) in <i>and kill the passover lamb</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">366</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>pi’el</i> imperative. Compare, <i>dabberu, hallelu</i></i> However, he spoke incorrectly. <i>Ve-shachatu</i> (shall kill it) in <i>and the whole congregation of Israel shall kill it</i> (v. 6) is a <i>kal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">367</sup><i class="footnote">And so too in our verse.</i> It<sup class="footnote-marker">368</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shachatu</i> in verse 6.</i> is properly vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>shin</i> because of the silent missing letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">369</sup><i class="footnote">That is because a <i>kamatz</i> (a silent missing letter) is always placed beneath the first letter in the <i>kal</i> perfect. I.E. refers to the <i>kamatz</i> as a silent missing letter because the <i>kamatz</i> vowel implies an <i>alef</i>. See I.E. on Ex. 2:4 and the notes thereto.</i> However, <i>ve-shachatu</i> (and kill) in <i>and kill the passover lamb</i> is imperative in the <i>kal</i>. We do not find this root in the <i>pi’el</i> in any place in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">370</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>shachatu</i> in our verse cannot be a <i>pi’el</i>.</i> The <i>shin</i> of <i>ve-shachatu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">371</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> should have been vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">372</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is an imperative.</i> as <i>miskhu</i> (draw)<sup class="footnote-marker">373</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kal</i> plural imperatives are vocalized with a <i>chirik</i> beneath their first letters.</i> is. However, since the <i>shin</i> is followed by a guttural<sup class="footnote-marker">374</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>chet</i>.</i> it was vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>, as is Hebrew practice. Compare, <i>bacharu</i> (choose) in <i>choose you</i> (Josh. 24:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">375</sup><i class="footnote">Which is vocalized <i>bachaeru</i>, not <i>bicharu</i> because a guttural, a <i>chet</i>, follows the <i>bet</i>.</i> There are many other similar instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">376</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, <i>nahagu, sha’alu</i>.</i> The <i>shin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">377</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>shachatu</i>.</i> is therefore vocalized with a long <i>pattach</i> in the imperative. Both words<sup class="footnote-marker">378</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-shachatu</i> (vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>shin</i>) in verse 6 and <i>ve-shachatu</i> (vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>shin</i>) in our verse.</i> are from the same conjugation.<sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">They are both in the <i>kal</i>. However, <i>shachatu</i> in verse 6 is a perfect and <i>shachatu</i> in our verse is in the imperative.</i>

Verse 22

AND YE SHALL TAKE. Moses now explains the manner in which the blood is to be taken and placed on the lintel.<sup class="footnote-marker">380</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 7 they were told to take the blood and place it on the lintel. Moses now explains the details of the ritual. Hence verse 22 is not redundant.</i>
[A BUNCH OF.] The word <i>aguddat</i> means a bunch (of). Compare, <i>la-aggudah</i> (band) in <i>and became one band</i> (II Sam. 2:25). Rabbi Merinus says that the <i>alef</i> in <i>aguddah</i> is appended,<sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote">Or superfluous. It is not a root letter and has no meaning, as the word could read <i>gudah</i> and mean the same.</i> as <i>aguddah</i> comes from the same root as <i>gedud</i> (troop).<sup class="footnote-marker">382</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 49:19. Its root is <i>gimel, dalet, dalet</i>. Hence the <i>alef</i> is appended.</i> Others say that the <i>alef</i> in <i>aguddah</i> is a root letter<sup class="footnote-marker">383</sup><i class="footnote">Its root being <i>alef, gimel, dalet</i>.</i> like the <i>alef</i> in <i>afuddato</i> (skillfully woven)<sup class="footnote-marker">384</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>alef, peh, dalet. Afuddato</i> minus the pronominal suffix is <i>afuddah</i>. Thus <i>aguddah</i> follows the paradigm of <i>afuddah</i>.</i> in <i>and the skillfully woven band</i> (Ex 28:6).
[HYSSOP.] Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that <i>azov</i> (hyssop) is a plant known in Arabic as <i>zatr</i> and in the vernacular as oregano. It is an herb distinguished by various kinds of flavors. However, this interpretation is incorrect, for Scripture states, <i>even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall</i> (I Kings 5:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">385</sup><i class="footnote">The oregano plant does not grow out of walls.</i> I do not know the identity of the <i>azov</i>. However, logically speaking it is not a very mighty plant for it is the opposite of the cedar mentioned in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">386</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 5:13 reads: <i>And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall</i>.</i>
[BASIN.] Some say that they slaughtered the paschal lamb in the threshold of the gate,<sup class="footnote-marker">387</sup><i class="footnote">In a trench cut in the threshold (Krinsky). In other words, <i>saf</i> (basin) means a threshold.</i> and they dipped the hyssop into it and then touched the side-posts with the blood. They say that the word <i>saf</i> (basin) is similar in meaning to the word <i>saf</i> (threshold) in <i>and he measured the threshold</i> (saf) <i>of the gate</i> (Ezek. 40:6)<sup class="footnote-marker">388</sup><i class="footnote">New J.P.S. translation.</i> and to <i>sippim</i> (thresholds)<sup class="footnote-marker">389</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sippim</i> is the plural of <i>saf</i>.</i> in <i>and the posts of the thresholds moved</i> (Is. 6:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> Others say that <i>saf</i> (basin) is similar to <i>sappot</i> (basins) in <i>brought beds, and basins</i> (II Sam. 17:28) and that <i>saf</i> is a vessel over which they slaughtered the paschal lamb.
[UNTIL THE MORNING.] I will yet explain what this means.<sup class="footnote-marker">391</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on verse 31.</i>

Verse 23

AND WILL NOT SUFFER. He will not suffer <i>the destroyer. Yitten</i> (will suffer)<sup class="footnote-marker">392</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>yitten</i> literally means, will give. At times it has the meaning of will give permission. Rashi similarly interprets, “He will not give him the power to come” into your homes.</i> here is similar in meaning to <i>netatikha</i> (suffered I thee) in <i>Therefore suffered I thee not</i> (Gen. 20:6). Now, the destroyer is under God’s power. If God allows him to come into their homes it is as if He gave him permission to do so.

Verse 24

AND YE SHALL OBSERVE THIS THING. Many are of the opinion that the placing of the blood on the lintel and on the two side-posts is an obligation for all generations because <i>this thing</i><sup class="footnote-marker">393</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever</i>.</i> is connected to<sup class="footnote-marker">394</sup><i class="footnote">It immediately follows.</i> the taking of the hyssop and dipping it into the lamb’s blood. Furthermore, Scripture afterwards states, <i>for that he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt</i> (v. 27).<sup class="footnote-marker">395</sup><i class="footnote">This is to be offered in response to the question, “What <i>mean ye by this service?</i> which will be asked by children in future generations (v. 26). <i>Prima facie</i>, the question pertains to the placing of the blood on the lintels and on the side-posts.</i> This interpretation would be correct from a logical point of view were it not for the true tradition which states otherwise.<sup class="footnote-marker">396</sup><i class="footnote">That the placing of the blood on the side-posts and lintels was only to be done in Egypt.</i> The correct interpretation is that <i>this thing</i><sup class="footnote-marker">397</sup><i class="footnote">What mean ye by this service? See note 395.</i> refers to <i>and kill the passover lamb</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">398</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 21, and not to the taking of the hyssop and dipping it into the lamb’s blood.</i> The meaning of the children’s question is,<sup class="footnote-marker">399</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26.</i> when your children will see their family in a group eating an entire lamb, whose bones one is prohibited to break, with its head, with its legs, and with the inwards thereof, unlike the custom on all other festivals, and from which a gentile, an uncircumcised one, a sojourner, and a hired servant may not eat, they will question you.<sup class="footnote-marker">400</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the children’s question does not pertain to the smearing of the blood on the lintel and side-posts but to the manner in which the Passover sacrifice is eaten.</i>

Verse 25

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS. Moses now explains that the slaughter of the paschal lamb is contingent upon dwelling in the Land of Israel. Do not be troubled by the Passover observed by Israelites at Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">401</sup><i class="footnote">Which was celebrated outside the boundaries of the Land of Israel. See Num. 9:1-5.</i> That was a commandment from on high.<sup class="footnote-marker">402</sup><i class="footnote">To observe that particular Passover outside of Israel (Num. 9:5). Otherwise Israel would not have offered the paschal sacrifice.</i> They did not observe another Passover in the desert. At Mount Sinai they were in an inhabited land and were thus able to find unleavened bread. However, when they were in a land that no man passed through<sup class="footnote-marker">403</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah’s description of the wilderness in which Israel journeyed on the way to the promised land (Jer. 2:6). I.E. borrows Jeremiah’s description because he wants to emphasize that Israel had no one to buy wheat from to bake <i>matzot</i>. Hence the only Passover they could have celebrated was the one at Sinai.</i> they only had manna.

Verse 26

AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS…WHAT MEAN YE BY THIS SERVICE. The strange ritual that I noted.<sup class="footnote-marker">404</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s final comments on verse 24.</i>

Verse 27

THAT YE SHALL SAY: IT IS THE SACRIFICE OF THE LORD’S PASSOVER. The word <i>pesach</i> (passover) is to be rendered pity, as we find, <i>paso’ach ve-himlit</i> (He will pity it and He will rescue it) (Is. 31:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">405</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> The lamb is termed <i>pesach</i> (passover), as in <i>and kill the passover</i> (pesach) (v. 21), because God had pity on the first-born of Israel because of the blood of the lamb. However, Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that the word <i>pesach</i> is derived from the word <i>pi’se’ach</i> (limp), since a lame person supports himself on his healthy leg.<sup class="footnote-marker">406</sup><i class="footnote">And hops or skips along. Hence a lame person is called a <i>pise’ach</i>, a hopper or skipper.</i> The destroyer acted in a similar manner. He exterminated the first-born in the Egyptian home and passed over<sup class="footnote-marker">407</sup><i class="footnote">Or hopped or skipped over.</i> the home of his Hebrew neighbor and did not destroy him. The term <i>posechim</i> (hopping) in <i>How long will you keep hopping between two opinions</i> (I Kings 18:20)<sup class="footnote-marker">408</sup><i class="footnote">So J.P.S. new translation.</i> is similar.

Verse 28

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WENT AND DID SO. They took a lamb on the tenth day of the month. They did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron: <i>This is the ordinance of the passover</i> (v. 43).

Verse 29

AND IT CAME TO PASS AT MIDNIGHT. The reference is to the second half of the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">409</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 11:4. This comment is not found in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38.</i>
[UNTO THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CAPTIVE THAT WAS IN THE DUNGEON.] Yefet says that the captives who grind the millstone in prison during the day are put at night into a pit whose opening is covered with the millstone.<sup class="footnote-marker">410</sup><i class="footnote">That they ground with during the day. The literal meaning of <i>bor</i> (dungeon) is pit. Hence Yefet’s interpretation.</i> This is the meaning of <i>behind the mill</i> (Ex. 11:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">411</sup><i class="footnote">There is thus no contradiction between our verse and Ex. 11:5.</i>

Verse 30

AND PHARAOH ROSE UP. He himself. <i>But the Levites alone shall do the service</i> (Num. 18:23), meaning the Levite himself, is similar.
FOR THERE WAS NOT A HOUSE WHERE THERE WAS NOT ONE DEAD. Scripture speaks of the majority of houses.<sup class="footnote-marker">412</sup><i class="footnote">For there must have been many houses in which there was no first-born male (Weiser).</i>

Verse 31

AND HE CALLED. Logically speaking Moses and Aaron were not in the land of Rameses with the Israelites on the night of the fifteenth. On the contrary, they were in that part of Egypt in which was the royal seat where Pharaoh lived.<sup class="footnote-marker">413</sup><i class="footnote">Awaiting Pharaoh’s permission to leave Egypt. Nahmanides interprets similarly.</i> Now Moses and Aaron left the doors of their homes at midnight<sup class="footnote-marker">414</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh called for them after the first-born had been slain.</i> in accordance with God’s dictate.<sup class="footnote-marker">415</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise they would not have been permitted to leave their homes. See verse 22. Hence I. E. assumes that God told Moses and Aaron to leave their dwellings in response to Pharaoh’s call. I.E.’s interpretation is contra the <i>Mekhilta</i>, which pictures Moses and Aaron as staying in their homes until the morning and Pharaoh going around the land of Egypt asking, “Where does Moses dwell? Where does Aaron dwell?” According to the <i>Mekhilta</i>, when Pharaoh found Moses and Aaron he said to them, “<i>Rise up, get you forth</i>,” etc. Moses responded, “We are warned not to go out except in broad daylight as it is written, <i>And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning</i>” (v. 22).</i> After Pharaoh gave the Israelites permission to go and worship God, Moses went with the servants of Pharaoh to Rameses to bring Israel out of Egypt. It is common knowledge in our time that there are six Persian miles<sup class="footnote-marker">416</sup><i class="footnote">A Persian mile is, 8000 cubits, or approximately 2 1/2 miles.</i> between ancient Egypt, where Joseph’s treasures are known to be until this very day, and Rameses. Now the Israelites began to leave Egypt in the morning,<sup class="footnote-marker">417</sup><i class="footnote">They were not allowed to leave their homes till this time (v. 22).</i> namely, at the break of dawn when the light of the sun is seen in the clouds. There is a full hour and a third between the moment that dawn breaks and sunrise. We find that it can be very dark and still be morning. Thus Scripture states, <i>And she</i><sup class="footnote-marker">418</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth.</i> <i>lay down at his feet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">419</sup><i class="footnote">Boaz’s feet.</i> <i>till the morning</i> (Ruth 3:14), and then adds, <i>before one could discern another</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">420</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that when morning begins people still cannot recognize each other because it is yet dark.</i> Now some Israelites exited Egypt at the break of dawn when, from the Torah’s standpoint, it is still night until sunrise.<sup class="footnote-marker">421</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. when the Torah speaks of day it means after sunrise.</i> This group was close to Egypt. Another group who were further from Egypt exited that very day.<sup class="footnote-marker">422</sup><i class="footnote">That is, after sunrise.</i> The Israelites constituted a very large congregation.<sup class="footnote-marker">423</sup><i class="footnote">That is why it took so long for all of them to leave.</i> It is more than eight Persian miles from one end of Rameses to another.<sup class="footnote-marker">424</sup><i class="footnote">Those Israelites who lived in that part of Rameses that was close to Egypt left at dawn and the others after sunrise.</i> Scripture therefore states in one place, <i>the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night</i><sup class="footnote-marker">425</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to those who left at the break of dawn.</i> (Deut. 16:1), and elsewhere reads, <i>This day ye go forth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">426</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to those who left after sunrise.</i> (Ex. 13:4). It is further stated, <i>the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians</i> (Num. 33:3),<sup class="footnote-marker">427</sup><i class="footnote">This too refers to those who left after sunrise.</i> and it is there recorded, <i>while the Egyptians were burying them that the Lord had smitten</i>. Now the Egyptians buried their dead during the day. I have thus explained the meaning of morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">428</sup><i class="footnote">As he promised to do at the end of verse 22. I.E. literally reads, I have already explained.</i> 
BOTH YE…AS YE HAVE SAID. <i>Our cattle also shall go with us</i> (Ex. 10:26). 

Verse 32

[AND BLESS ME ALSO.] Pharaoh asked them to bless him and pray for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">429</sup><i class="footnote">So too <i>Mekhilta</i>, Onkelos, Rashi, and Nahmanides.</i>
[ALSO.] Scripture reads <i>also</i> because Pharaoh, as Moses had foretold,<sup class="footnote-marker">430</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 10:25. The meaning of our verse is: take your flocks and go but also pray for me over the sacrifices which I now give you.</i> gave them sacrifices.

Verse 33

WERE URGENT. <i>Va-techezak</i> (were urgent) is in the feminine,<sup class="footnote-marker">431</sup><i class="footnote">However, <i>mitzrayim</i> (Egypt) is a masculine form. Scripture thus should have read, <i>va-yechezak</i>.</i> because the state of Egypt includes everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">432</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mitzrayim</i> is short for <i>medinat mitzrayim</i> (the state of Egypt). <i>Medinah</i> is feminine, hence the reading <i>va-techezak</i> (Krinsky).</i>
[WE ARE ALL DEAD.] I have explained its meaning in my comments on <i>lest he fall upon us with pestilence</i> (Ex. 5:3).

Verse 34

THEIR KNEADING-TROUGHS. <i>Misheret</i> (kneading-trough) is a wooden vessel. Compare, <i>mishartekha</i> (thy kneading-trough) in <i>thy basket and thy kneading-trough</i> (Deut. 28:5). Their asses were laden with garments which they asked of the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">433</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they had to carry their kneading-troughs on their shoulders.</i>

Verse 35

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID. Each one asked in accordance with his status. Thus we find that only the princes donated precious stones, spices, and oil for the work of the tabernacle (Ex. 35:27, 28).<sup class="footnote-marker">434</sup><i class="footnote">The other Israelites did not have these precious items. They did not ask the Egyptians for these items because their status did not allow them to do so.</i>

Verse 40

NOW THE TIME THAT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DWELT IN EGYPT WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS. There are many calculations<sup class="footnote-marker">454</sup><i class="footnote">Of years.</i> in Scripture whose point of departure is unknown to us. I will now mention a few of them. <i>And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king</i> (II Sam. 15:7). Now Absalom was not then forty years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">455</sup><i class="footnote">David reigned for 40 years (I Kings 2:11). Absalom was born after David was crowned king in Hebron (II Sam. 3:2) and predeceased David (II Sam. 18:14). Thus Absalom’s entire life span was less than 40 years. Hence the number 40 cannot apply to the years that passed from Absalom’s birth.</i> Furthermore, King David’s reign was not yet over.<sup class="footnote-marker">456</sup><i class="footnote">David reigned for 40 years. However, since his reign was not yet over, the number 40 cannot apply to it.</i> The commentaries tell us that the point of departure for this calculation is <i>from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim</i> (I Sam. 7:2). It is stated, <i>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year</i> (Ezek. 1:1). Some say that Ezekiel was thirty years old when he began to prophesy.<sup class="footnote-marker">457</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>the thirtieth year</i> refers to the thirtieth year of Ezekiel’s life.</i> Others say that the reference is to the thirtieth year of the jubilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">458</sup><i class="footnote">So Rashi and Kimchi.</i> Other say that its point of departure is the finding of the Torah which was discovered by Hilkiah the priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">459</sup><i class="footnote">See II Kings 22. This is the opinion of <i>Seder Olam</i> 26 and <i>Targum Jonathan</i>.</i> However, I am uncertain, for they are opinions without foundation or support. It is written: <i>And within threescore and five years shall Ephraim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">460</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Another name for the kingdom of Samaria</i>.</i> <i>be broken, that it be not a people</i> (Is. 7:8). The latter prophesy was uttered during the days of Ahaz, whose reign lasted for sixteen years. Samaria was exiled in the sixth year of his son Hezekiah’s reign.<sup class="footnote-marker">461</sup><i class="footnote">Thus at most 22 years could have passed between Isaiah’s prophecy and the exile of Ephraim/Samaria. What then did Isaiah mean by saying that at the end of 65 years Ephraim shall cease to be a people?</i> The commentaries were therefore forced to say that the sixty-five years start from the day that Amos prophesied, <i>And Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land</i> (Amos 7:11). Others say that its point of departure is the earthquake.<sup class="footnote-marker">462</sup><i class="footnote">See Amos 1:1.</i> Now when we investigated the years starting with the time that Israel came to Egypt in the days of Joseph and his brothers we found that they do not come to the number of years spoken of in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">463</sup><i class="footnote">430 years.</i> There is no doubt that Kehat<sup class="footnote-marker">464</sup><i class="footnote">Son of Levi.</i> was among those who descended to Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">465</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture explicitly says so. See Gen. 46:11.</i> Let us imagine that Kehat<sup class="footnote-marker">466</sup><i class="footnote">Who lived 133 years. See Ex. 6:18.</i> begot his son Amram at the end of his life and that Amram<sup class="footnote-marker">467</sup><i class="footnote">Who lived 137 years. See Ex. 6:20.</i> similarly begot Moses at the end of his life. Now the years of Kehat and Amram’s lives come to two hundred and seventy. Moses was eighty years old when the Israelites went out of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">468</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 7:7.</i> It all thus comes to three hundred and fifty years. We are missing eighty years. It is for this reason that the elders<sup class="footnote-marker">469</sup><i class="footnote">The 70 elders who translated the Torah into Greek.</i> added, “dwelt in Egypt and other countries.”<sup class="footnote-marker">470</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Megillah</i> 9a.</i> The <i>four hundred years</i> in <i>and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years</i> (Gen. 15:13) is not connected to <i>and they shall afflict them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">471</sup><i class="footnote">Israel was not enslaved for 400 years.</i> but rather to <i>thy seed shall be a stranger</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">472</sup><i class="footnote">The verse should be understood as follows: Thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs for four hundred years, part of which time they shall serve them and afflict them.</i> There are many other such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">473</sup><i class="footnote">When a clause is not connected to what immediately precedes it.</i> We similarly find in our own chapter, <i>from the first day until the seventh day</i> (v. 15).<sup class="footnote-marker">474</sup><i class="footnote">Which is not connected to what immediately precedes it.

See Gen. 15.</i> <i>that thy seed shall be a stranger…four hundred years</i>. We know that the number of years that Israel dwelt in Egypt<sup class="footnote-marker">476</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in our verse.</i> is contingent upon the “end,”<sup class="footnote-marker">477</sup><i class="footnote">The end of 400 years of being strangers.</i> which was told to Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">478</sup><i class="footnote">In Gen. 15:13.</i> The author of the <i>Seder Olam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">479</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Jose bar Chalafta, a second-century Tanna.</i> was compelled to say that after Abraham came to the land of Canaan he returned to Haran.<sup class="footnote-marker">480</sup><i class="footnote">In order to reconcile the number 430 given in our verse with the number 400 given in Genesis <i>Seder Olam</i> explains that the number 430 refers to the time that passed from the “covenant between the pieces” (Gen. 15), and the number 400 refers to the time from the birth of Isaac. The accounting is as follows: Abraham was 70 years old when God made the “covenant between the pieces” with him and told him that his children would be strangers for 400 years (Gen. 15:13). Abraham then went to Haran and spent five years there, as it is written, <i>And Abraham was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran</i> (Gen. 12:4). Now Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old (Gen. 21:5). Abraham thus lived in Canaan for 30 years without a son. Exodus, as noted above, starts the count from the “covenant between the pieces.” Genesis starts the count with the birth of Isaac 30 years later. However, it must be pointed out that the <i>Seder Olam</i>’s accounting is based on a number of assumptions: a) That the covenant between the pieces occurred when Abraham was 70 years old. Scripture nowhere says so. b) That Abraham returned to Haran. Scripture does not say this either. Hence I.E. did not want to accept the <i>Seder Olam</i>’s calculations. The question thus remains how to reconcile the number of years mentioned in Exodus with those given in Genesis.</i> The commentaries were forced to say that the prophecy <i>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees</i> (Gen. 15:7) is not connected to the above-noted chapter<sup class="footnote-marker">481</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 15, the “covenant between the pieces,” as Abraham was yet to leave the land.</i> but was said later.<sup class="footnote-marker">482</sup><i class="footnote">After he returned to Canaan and permanently settled there. This too is not in keeping with the plain meaning of the text and is an argument against the <i>Seder Olam</i>.</i> However, there is no need for all of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">483</sup><i class="footnote">a) To assume in contradiction to Gen. 15:5 that Abraham was 70 at the “covenant between the pieces”; b) to assume that Abraham returned to Haran; c) to assume that Gen. 15:7 is out of place and was not said at the “covenant between the pieces.”</i> Only the counting of the four hundred years is from the day that Isaac was born.<sup class="footnote-marker">484</sup><i class="footnote">As explained by the <i>Seder Olam</i>, for Scripture speaks there of <i>thy seed</i>.</i> The additional thirty years start from the day that Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees, the land of his nativity, and came with his father to Haran, as it is written, <i>and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there</i> (Gen. 11: 31). Abraham lived in Haran with his father for five years.<sup class="footnote-marker">485</sup><i class="footnote">If the 430 years start from the day that Abraham left Ur then Abraham had to be 70 years old when he left that city, for Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old and Israel was liberated 400 years later (see note 480). Now Scripture tells us that Abraham left Haran when he was 75 (Gen. 12:4). Therefore he spent five years in Haran. In his commentary on Genesis, I.E. implies that we cannot ascertain how many years Abraham spent in Haran. See I.E. on Gen. 12:1 and the notes thereto.</i> He came to the land of Canaan at the age of seventy-five and never returned to Haran. Now thirty years passed from the time that Abraham left Haran till the day Isaac was born. Abraham was the important one,<sup class="footnote-marker">486</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the calculations in our verse begin with him.</i> and to him was the land of the Canaanite given. The verse <i>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees</i> (Gen. 15:7) is connected to the entire chapter preceding<sup class="footnote-marker">487</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, above.</i> and following it.<sup class="footnote-marker">488</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, below. In other words, the words in the verse were said to Abraham at the “covenant of the pieces.”</i> The meaning of <i>Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt</i> is to be explained: they were strangers there, also their fathers were strangers, as it is written, <i>Yea, very few, and sojourners in it</i> (Ps. 105:12); and as Abraham said, I <i>am a stranger and a sojourner with you</i> (Gen. 23:4).
FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS. From the day that their father Abraham left the land of his birth. 

Verse 41

[AND IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS.] Scripture states this so that it be known that they did not exit Egypt because of their cries to God until the time<sup class="footnote-marker">489</sup><i class="footnote">430 years starting from the day that Abraham left Ur Chasdim.</i> that the Lord had decreed for them had come.<sup class="footnote-marker">490</sup><i class="footnote">Their crying reminded God that the period He ordained for their being strangers was over. Had they not cried out unto the Lord, the period of their servitude would not have ended, because according to the arrangement of the stars they were destined to remain in servitude for a much longer time. See I.E. on Ex. 2:23, 24 and 33:21 (Weiser).</i>

Verse 42

IT WAS A NIGHT OF WATCHING UNTO THE LORD. Since Scripture notes, <i>it was a night of watching unto the Lord</i>, and concludes by saying, <i>this same night is a night of watching unto the Lord for all the children of Israel throughout their generations</i>, the plain meaning of our verse appears to be: since God watched them and did not suffer the destroyer to come into their homes to plague them,<sup class="footnote-marker">491</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>It was a night of watching unto the Lord</i>.</i> the Lord commanded that this night be <i>a night of watching</i><sup class="footnote-marker">492</sup><i class="footnote">That is, observance. The Hebrew <i>shamar</i> means both watch and observe. Since God watched (<i>shamar</i>) Israel on this night, Israel must observe (<i>li-shemor</i>) God’s special laws this night. Hence <i>lel shimurim</i> (a night of watching) means a night of observance.</i><i>for all the children of Israel throughout their generations</i> through the eating of the paschal lamb according to its ordinance and the ingesting of unleavened bread and bitter herbs on this night. Others say that watching here has the same meaning as the word watching in <i>The watchers of the walls</i> (Cant. 5:7); its meaning is that they should not sleep on this night but should praise God and relate the might that the Lord displayed when they went out of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">493</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation <i>lel shimurim</i> means a watch night.</i> Our sages hinted at the latter meaning when they said, <i>The time for the reading of the morning shema has arrived</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">494</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that the sages stayed up all night on the night of the seder. See Passover Haggadah. Also see <i>Tosefta Pesachim</i> 10.</i>

Verse 43

AND THE LORD SAID…THIS IS THE ORDINANCE OF THE PASSOVER. Since Scripture mentioned <i>t</i>hat it was <i>a night of watching</i> (v. 42), the reference being to the night of the fifteenth wherein the paschal lamb is to be eaten, the <i>Torah</i> completes its explanation of the laws of the Passover<sup class="footnote-marker">495</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 43-50.</i> that is to be observed in future generations. Now Scripture does not mention the lintel and the side-post. Neither does it mention that the lamb is to be eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs,<sup class="footnote-marker">496</sup><i class="footnote">In verses 43-50.</i> as they were previously mentioned with regard to the Passover observed in Egypt. Its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">497</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>This is the ordinance of the passover</i>.</i> thus is: you shall eat the Passover offering in the future as you ate it in Egypt. Scripture then added other commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">498</sup><i class="footnote">The purpose of this chapter was to give additional rules concerning the Passover.</i> However, the commandments with regard to the lintel and the side-post have nothing to do with the eating of the paschal lamb.<sup class="footnote-marker">499</sup><i class="footnote">Hence unlike the eating of unleavened bread and bitter herbs it does not have to be observed in future Passovers.</i> Do you not see that at the beginning of the chapter (i.e., v. 43) it states, <i>there shall no alien eat thereof</i> (bo)?<sup class="footnote-marker">500</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a law not previously mentioned. We thus see that the purpose of this chapter was to give additional rules concerning the Passover.</i> The meaning of <i>bo</i> (thereof) is, of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">501</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>bo</i> usually means in him or in it.</i> Its usage in this context is correct in Hebrew<sup class="footnote-marker">502</sup><i class="footnote">It is proper Hebrew to say, <i>lo yokhal bo</i> (he shall not eat of it), although from a very literal point of view it means he shall not eat in it.</i> and also in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">503</sup><i class="footnote">A similar term is used in Arabic.</i> <i>Ve-hanotar ba-basar u-va-lechem</i> (and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread) (Lev. 8:32) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">504</sup><i class="footnote">Here too the <i>bet</i> means “of.” <i>Ba-basar</i> literally means in the meat and <i>ba-lechem</i> in the bread. However, in Lev. 8:32 <i>ba-basar u-va-lechem</i> are to be rendered of the flesh and of the bread.</i>

Verse 44

BUT EVERY MAN’S SERVANT…WHEN THOU HAST CIRCUMCISED HIM. According to his wish, that he be converted to the law of Israel, if he is of the age when one is obligated to observe the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">505</sup><i class="footnote">The age of thirteen.</i> The law dealing with someone <i>that is bought for money</i> and someone born in the house is the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">506</sup><i class="footnote">The two are usually coupled together. See Gen. 17:12, 13; Lev. 22:11.</i> However, Scripture deals with that which is more prevalent.<sup class="footnote-marker">507</sup><i class="footnote">Hence only someone <i>that is bought for money</i> is mentioned here</i>

Verse 45

A SOJOURNER AND A HIRED SERVANT. Who are Israelites<sup class="footnote-marker">508</sup><i class="footnote">Contra the rabbis who interpreted the verse as applying to non-Jews. Cf. <i>Mekhilta</i> 15, Rashi, and Nahmanides.</i> shall not eat of the paschal lamb if a portion of the lamb has not been assigned to them, as is the law for the entire congregation.

Verse 46

IN ONE HOUSE SHALL IT BE EATEN. As the paschal lamb eaten in Egypt was. <i>Thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house</i> is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">509</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Carry forth aught</i> implies that <i>house</i> is to be taken literally (Krinsky).</i> However, our sages of blessed memory said that in one house means in one company.<sup class="footnote-marker">510</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mekhilta</i> 15, Onkelos, and Rashi.</i> The latter is the correct interpretation.

Verse 47

ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SHALL KEEP IT. All those of the age when one is obligated to observe the commandments are required to prepare a paschal lamb. When I researched the Torah, I found that the twenty-three times where <i>karet</i> (excision) is stated<sup class="footnote-marker">511</sup><i class="footnote">It should be noted that according to the Mishnah in <i>Kritot</i> 1:1, the Torah prescribes excision for 36 transgressions. The discrepancy is explained by Krinsky.</i> refer to negative precepts. However, I found only two dealing with positive precepts, namely, the paschal lamb<sup class="footnote-marker">512</sup><i class="footnote">The question thus arises, why is such a harsh penalty inflicted upon one who violates the positive commandment of offering a paschal lamb?</i> and circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">513</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 17:14.</i> Perhaps the reason for this is that there is an obligation to “remember” the Exodus from Egypt, and there is no greater manifestation of “remembering” than eating the paschal lamb in its proper time. And the beginning of the decalogue states, <i>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</i> (Ex. 20:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">514</sup><i class="footnote">Hence remembering the Exodus is a very important commandment, and by not offering the paschal lamb one is in effect denying the Exodus.</i>

Verse 48

AND WHEN A STRANGER SHALL SOJOURN WITH THEE. The meaning of <i>with thee</i> is, with thee in the land of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">515</sup><i class="footnote">As a mixed multitude joined Israel.</i>
[AND WILL KEEP THE PASSOVER.] Its meaning is, and he wants to keep the Passover. Then let him first be circumcised.
[BUT NO UNCIRCUMCISED PERSON SHALL EAT THERE-OF.] The reference is to uncircumcised Israelites<sup class="footnote-marker">516</sup><i class="footnote">Not to sinners.</i> such as those born on the way in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">517</sup><i class="footnote">Who because of the danger involved could not be circumcised. See Josh. 5:5, 7.</i>

Verse 49

ONE LAW. The stranger spoken of in this verse refers to a righteous proselyte, not to a stranger that dwells within the gates.<sup class="footnote-marker">518</sup><i class="footnote">And does not accept Judaism. Such a stranger who is uncircumcised cannot eat of the paschal lamb, and the statement in verse 49 (one law, etc.) which deals with the eating of the Passover offering cannot apply to him.</i> 

Verse 50

[THUS DID ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] Scripture has already mentioned this above.<sup class="footnote-marker">519</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 28.</i> Perhaps the reason it is noted again is that it refers to the Passover offering brought in the wilderness of Sinai,<sup class="footnote-marker">520</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 9:5.</i> at which time the strangers were circumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">521</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>thus did all the children of Israel</i> does not repeat what is stated in verse 28, but refers to the circumcision of the strangers (<i>gerim</i>). It was a convenient place to circumcise those strangers who were not circumcised in Egypt.</i> Do not be surprised that this is written in this place.<sup class="footnote-marker">522</sup><i class="footnote">When it happened a year later.</i> Scripture states in the chapter dealing with the coming down of the manna that they should take a jar and put manna therein and place it before the Lord (Ex. 16:33). However, God had not yet commanded the making of the ark of the testimony.<sup class="footnote-marker">523</sup><i class="footnote">Recorded in Ex. 25:10-14. Thus Ex. 16:33 is chronologically out of place.</i> <i>Have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt</i> (v. 17) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">524</sup><i class="footnote">It is chronologically out of place because when this was said Israel was still in Egypt. See I.E. on verse 17.</i>

Verse 51

AND IT CAME TO PASS THE SELFSAME DAY. I believe that this verse is connected to the verse which follows,<sup class="footnote-marker">525</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 13:1, 2.</i> in which God told Moses to sanctify the first-born. The plague of the first-born took place at midnight, and when Israel went out of Egypt the next day God immediately commanded that the first-born of Israel and the first-born of their cattle be sanctified.<sup class="footnote-marker">526</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 12:51 and what comes next should be understood as follows: And it came to pass the selfsame day that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts, that the Lord spoke unto Moses saying: Sanctify unto Me all the first-born, etc.</i>

Chapter 13



Verse 1

AND THE LORD SPOKE. Scripture employs a short form,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture should have followed up our verse with: speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them as in Num. 6:1,2. As things stand, it is nowhere stated in our chapter that Moses told or was commanded to relate the contents of verse 1 to the Israelites.</i> for Moses stands in place of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses</i> is the same as saying, the Lord spoke unto Israel; i.e., the contents of this chapter pertained to Israel.</i> However, Yefet says that Moses was commanded to verbally sanctify all first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to Yefet this command was only for Moses. Moses personally was to declare all first-born holy.</i> The aforementioned is the reverse of <i>then the priest shall defile him</i> (Lev. 13:8);<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. J.P.S. renders, <i>then the priest shall pronounce him unclean</i>. Both Moses and the priests perform their actions verbally. What I.E. means by the term “reverse” is that one makes someone unclean while the other makes one holy.</i> the priest, being holy, defiles an individual by declaration.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">And not in any other way. The verse can be taken to mean that the priest shall place an unclean object upon the subject in order to make him unclean, hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 2

OPENETH. <i>Peter</i> (openeth) means the opening of. <i>Peter</i> is similar to <i>peture</i> (open) in <i>and open flowers</i> (I Kings 6:18). Its meaning is, the son who first opens the womb.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Peter kol rechem</i> literally means the opening of the womb, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The word <i>rechem</i> (womb) is irregular, as according to the rules of Hebrew grammar the letter preceding a guttural is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than a <i>segol</i> in penultimately accented nouns. Compare, <i>nachal</i> (river), <i>lahav</i> (flame), and <i>na’ar</i> (youth) (Weiser). Hence our word should have been vocalized <i>racham</i> rather than <i>rechem</i>. Cf. Jud. 5:30.</i>

Verse 3

AND MOSES SAID. <i>Remember this day</i> was said by Moses on the fifteenth day.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Of Nisan, the day that they actually left Egypt. The Hebrew literally reads: on the day (<i>ba-yom</i>) of the 15th day (<i>yom</i>) he said remember. Filwarg correctly points out that the second <i>yom</i> is a scribal error and should be deleted.</i> It means the same as <i>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial</i> (Ex. 12:14).
[OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE.] This indicates that the Egyptians forced them to work as if they were their slaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture speaks of the place/house of bondage. However, the Israelites were not true slaves. They were a separate nation. They lived in their own houses, not in the homes of their masters; they had a family life and a culture. I.E. apparently comments thus so that people would not think of the ancient Israelites in the same way that they thought of contemporary slaves, i.e., as mean people. Cf. Aristotle’s <i>Politics</i>, 1:5, “From the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule…Clearly there are some who are by nature free, others are by nature slaves, and for the latter their condition of servitude is both advantageous and just.”</i> Elsewhere Scripture reads, <i>out of the iron furnace</i> (Deut. 4:20), for the Egyptians overpowered them.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And forced them to work as if they were the slaves, of the Egyptians.</i> However, the Lord brought them out <i>by strength of hand</i> from the mighty.

Verse 4

THIS DAY. Moses first mentions, <i>there shall be no leavened bread eaten</i>, its meaning being, do in future generations what you did on the day that you left Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Eat no leaven on that day.</i> As you left Egypt at the time when the first ears (<i>aviv</i>) are found,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4 reads, <i>ha-yom attem yotze’im be-chodesh ha-aviv</i> (This day ye go forth in the month Abib). I.E. interprets this verse to mean: This day ye go forth in the month of fresh ears.</i> so shall you do yearly in the future in the Land of Israel when the first ears come. The first ears refers to the first ears of barley. The word <i>aviv</i> (Abib) means the first that ripens.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The barley ripens first.</i> <i>Aviv</i> comes from the same root as <i>av</i> (father), which means first to the one whom one begets, or sage<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A sage is called an <i>av</i>. Cf. Jud. 17:10, <i>Dwell with me, and be unto me a father</i> (av) <i>and a priest</i>; and <i>Pirke Avot</i> (Ethics of the Fathers/Sages).</i> to the student whom one teaches.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In this case <i>av</i> means first in wisdom.</i> Furthermore, it is written, <i>for the barley was in the ear</i> (aviv) (Ex. 9:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that <i>aviv</i> refers to ears of barley.</i> <i>Even of the first-fruits</i> (bikkure) <i>of wheat harvest</i> (Ex. 34:22),<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah refers to the first ears of the wheat harvest as <i>bikkurim</i>, not <i>avivim</i>, for <i>aviv</i> refers to the first barley ears, which ripen about two months before the wheat does.</i> which is written with regard to the festival of weeks,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Which falls seven weeks after Passover.</i> is proof of the above.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>aviv</i> means first.</i>

Verse 5

AND IT SHALL BE. Scripture does not list all of the seven Canaanite nations because they have already been mentioned elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">They are listed in Gen. 15:19-21 and there is no need to repeat all of them here.</i>

Verse 6

THE SEVEN DAYS. This is the service.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in verse 5.</i>

Verse 7

UNLEAVENED BREAD. Now the stranger that is within the gate was exhorted by God to observe the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20:10.</i> as it is only on the condition that he do no work before the Lord on the Sabbath that he may dwell within the gates. Similarly on the Day of Atonement, for it is so written.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Day of Atonement is called <i>a sabbath of solemn rest</i> (Lev. 23:32).</i> The same applies to Passover, as a stranger is not permitted to eat leaven even on his own property. This is the meaning of <i>in all thy borders</i>.

Verse 8

IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT. Rabbi Merinus says that <i>ba’avur zeh</i> (it is because of that) should have been written, <i>zeh ba’avur</i>; i.e., this is because of what the Lord did for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads: And thou shalt tell thy son in that day saying, because of this (<i>ba’avur zeh</i>) the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt. Rabbi Merinus could find no sense in this. <i>Prima facie</i>, “because of this” refers to the eating of <i>matzah</i>. What meaning is there in: because of the eating of the <i>matzah</i>, the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt? He thus interprets our verse to mean: It is because of that (<i>zeh ba’avur</i>) which the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt that I eat <i>matzah</i> and abstain from leaven.</i> He cited what in his opinion are many other such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Where the word order has to be inverted. See <i>Sefer Ha-Rikmah</i>, chap. 28.</i> However, I do not think that he was right in even one instance. For how can we invert the words of the living God? The meaning of the verse is just the opposite of what he understands it to be, because we do not eat unleavened bread “because of this.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ba’avur zeh</i> is not to be interpreted as a reason for the eating of the matzah and abstaining from leaven.</i> Its meaning rather is: it is because of this, i.e., it is because of this service, namely, the eating of unleavened bread and the abstention from leavened bread, which are the first of the precepts that God commanded us, that the Lord did signs for us and brought us out of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is to be understood thus: And thou shalt tell thy son in that day saying: It is because we should observe this (and other) precept(s) the Lord did signs for me when I went out of Egypt. So too Rashi.</i> Its meaning thus is: God took us out of Egypt only to serve Him, as it is written, <i>when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain</i> (Ex. 20:12). It is furthermore stated, <i>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">That is, so that you will serve me.</i> <i>I am the Lord your God</i> (Num. 15:41).

Verse 9

AND IT SHALL BE A SIGN UNTO THEE. There are those who oppose our holy patriarchs<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Who interpret our verse literally and say that <i>for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes</i> refers to the phylacteries placed upon the hand and head.</i> and say<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Those who oppose the rabbis. I.E. reads, <i>she-amar</i>. This is obviously a scribal error. The correct reading is, <i>she-ameru</i>.</i> that <i>for a sign…and for a memorial</i> is to be understood in the manner of <i>For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy head</i> (Prov. 1:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Which is not to be taken literally, for it refers to the teachings of one’s father and mother (Prov. 1:8). Similarly with our verse (see note 20). It is worthy of note that this interpretation is found in Rashbam, who notes that from a literal point of view our verse is to be taken metaphorically: that is, a person should recall the Exodus as if it were written upon his hand and adorned his head as a jewel.</i> They also say that <i>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand</i> (Deut. 5:8) is like <i>Bind them continually upon thy heart, Tie them upon thy neck</i> (Prov. 6:21)<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Which is not to be taken literally.</i> and also that <i>And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house</i> (Deut. 6:9) is like <i>Write them upon the table of thy heart</i> (Prov. 3:3). They furthermore say that <i>it shall be for a sign…and for a memorial</i> means <i>for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt</i> shall drop from your lips.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Its knowledge shall be second nature, so that you can recall it and speak of it at the drop of a hat.</i> However, this is incorrect, for at the beginning of the book of Proverbs it is stated, <i>The Proverbs of Solomon</i>. Thus whatever Solomon henceforth mentions is by way of parable. However, it is not, heaven forbid, written in the Torah that it is metaphoric. Hence it is to be taken only at face value. We thus will not interpret it except literally. It does not contradict reason if explained according to its plain meaning, like <i>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart</i> (Deut. 10:16), which has to be interpreted according to the requirements of reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s third approach to Biblical interpretation, Vol. 1, pp. 10 and 11.</i>
[UPON THY HAND.] Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that the term <i>yad</i> (hand) in most of Scripture refers to the left hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis the hand phylactery is placed on the left hand.</i> as in <i>Yea, My hand</i> (yadi) <i>hath laid the foundation of the earth, And My right hand hath spread out the heavens</i> (Is. 48:13); and <i>Her hand</i> (yadah) <i>she put to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmen’s hammer</i> (Jud. 5:26). However, the teachings of tradition are firmly established and do not require any support.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. disagrees that <i>yad</i> usually refers to the left hand.</i>

Verse 10

FROM YEAR TO YEAR. <i>Mi-yamim yamimah</i> (from year to year) is similar to <i>yamim tiheyeh ge’ullato</i> (for a full year shall he have the right of redemption (Lev. 25:29). The meaning of <i>mi-yamim yamimah</i> is, from year to year. The year begins when the Bet Din announces its commencement.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">As explained by I.E. in his comments on Ex. 12:2.</i>

Verse 11

AND IT SHALL BE. Moses mentions only the Canaanite, because he was the father of them all.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 10:15-18. Hence the term Canaanite includes all the inhabitants of Canaan. Also see I.E. on Gen. 15:20</i>
[AS HE SWORE UNTO THEE.] Its meaning is similar to <i>for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give this land</i> (Gen. 26:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>As He swore unto thee and to thy fathers</i> means as He swore unto your fathers to give this land to you their seed (Krinsky), as we do not find God taking this oath to the generation enslaved in Egypt.</i>

Verse 12

THAT THOU SHALT SET APART. Thou shalt set it apart unto the Lord so that it does not get mixed up with another. Now these two precepts<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The sanctification of the first-born (v. 2) and the eating of unleavened bread (v. 3 and 6).</i> were commanded on the fifteenth day.
COMING OF. <i>Sheger</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized <i>segol, segol</i>.</i> (coming of) follows the paradigm of <i>eretz</i> (land of) whose vocalization does not change in the construct. However, a number of irregular cases<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Nouns vocalized <i>segol, segol</i> whose vowels change to <i>sheva, pattach</i> in the construct.</i> are found. They are: <i>shegar</i> (the increase of)<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>sheger</i>, as in our verse.</i> in <i>the increase of thy kine</i> (Deut. 7:13), <i>chadar</i> (chamber of)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of which is <i>cheder</i>.</i> in <i>and in the chamber of thy bed</i> (Ex. 7:28), <i>havel</i> (vanity of)<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of which is <i>hevel</i>.</i> in <i>Vanity of vanities</i> (Eccles. 1:1), <i>hamatekha</i> (thy venom)<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of which is <i>chemet</i>.</i> in <i>That puttest thy venom thereto</i> (Hab. 2:15), and <i>delatekha</i> (thy doors)<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of which is <i>delet</i>.</i> in <i>and shut the doors</i> (Is. 26:20). I have not found any additional instances.

Verse 13

AND EVERY FIRSTLING OF AN ASS. Which is unclean, <i>thou shalt redeem with a lamb</i>.
THOU SHALT BREAK ITS NECK. Some say that <i>va-arafto</i> (thou shalt break its neck) means thou shalt write the word holy on its neck.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>oref</i> means a neck. Hence <i>va-arafto</i> literally means: and you shall neck it. Hence the possibility of this interpretation.</i> However, I say that anyone who says this is himself a stiff-necked ass. For behold it is written, <i>He will break down</i> (ya’arof) <i>their altars</i> (Hos. 10:2),<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the verb derived from <i>oref</i> means to break.</i> and <i>ve-arefu sham et ha-eglah ba-nachal</i> (and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley) (Deut. 21:4), in which the meaning of <i>ve-arefu</i> is, as explained by the transmitters of the law, to cut off the neck.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently no one disputes the rabbinic interpretation. Otherwise I.E. would be guilty of circular reasoning.</i> All firstlings that are not brought up on the altar or are not redeemed are required to be killed, as all the first-born of Egypt both man and beast perished. God did not save them<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The first-born of Israel, both man and beast.</i> from the decree which he had issued on the first-born of the Egyptians except that they should be prepared for His service. The Israelites had no unclean animals except for asses. Therefore no other<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Unclean.</i> first-born<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Animal.</i> is to be redeemed.

Verse 14

AND IT SHALL BE. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi of blessed memory says that the word <i>machar</i> (in time to come)<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, tomorrow.</i> is missing an <i>alef</i>, its meaning being that which comes after today.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In other words <i>machar</i> is short for <i>me’acher</i> (after). Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi interprets this way because “And it shall come to pass when thy son asketh thee tomorrow (<i>machar</i>),” etc., makes no sense in our context, whereas <i>And it shall come to pass when thy son asketh thee in time to come</i> (machar) does. Also see Rashi, “There are instances when <i>machar</i> means after some time.”</i>

Verse 15

AND IT CAME TO PASS. Moses begins by saying, <i>By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt</i> (v. 14) and backtracks and explains that what the strength of hand refers to is the plague of the first-born. It was because of this plague, and not because of the first plagues, that Israel went out of Egypt. The poet similarly says, <i>To Him that smote Egypt in their first-born, For His mercy endureth for ever</i> (Ps. 136:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Which is followed by <i>And brought out Israel from among them</i> (Ps. 136:11). None of the other plagues are recalled in Ps. 136. Only this plague is mentioned, because it was the one that caused Pharaoh to permit Israel to leave Egypt.</i> Moses wrote elliptically. When Moses said, <i>that the Lord slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beasts</i>, it was known<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">At that time.</i> that God saved our first-born and the first-born of our cattle. It is to the latter,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Although it is not stated in the text.</i> not to the slaying of the first-born, that <i>therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb</i> is connected.
ALL THAT OPENETH THE WOMB, BEING MALES. From a kind fit to be sacrificed to the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, “all” is not to be taken literally because it does not include unclean animals.</i>

Verse 16

AND IT SHALL BE FOR A SIGN. Scripture mentions, <i>And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand</i> with regard to two commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The eating of unleavened bread (v. 9) and the sanctification of the first-born (v. 16).</i> That which the sages of blessed memory transmitted, namely, that the chapters<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 13:1-10 and Ex. 13:11-16, which contain these commandments.</i> are to be written,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In the phylacteries.</i> is true.
AND FOR FRONTLETS. <i>Totafot</i> (frontlets) means a memorial.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is similar to verse 9, which has <i>zikaron</i> (memorial) in place of <i>totafot</i> (frontlets).</i> Others say<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Menachem ben Saruk (c. 910-970 C.E.). See Rashi.</i> that the <i>tet</i> of <i>totafot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Which is spelled with two <i>tafs</i>.</i> is doubled,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>tet, peh</i>. Menachem believed that Hebrew words come from a two-letter root</i> its meaning being to speak. They say that it comes from the same root as <i>ve-hettef</i> (and preach) in <i>and preach toward the south</i> (Ezek. 21:2). However, in my opinion this is far-fetched.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Because <i>ve-hettef</i> comes from the root <i>nun, tet, peh</i> whereas <i>totafot</i> comes from the root <i>tet, tet, peh</i> (Krinsky).</i> 
Can a fool who rebels against his maker succeed? When at peace his liver an arrow shall split. Note and take heed, O recusant; All that the portion <i>Be-Shallach</i> records concerning Pharaoh.

Verse 17

AND IT CAME TO PASS WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET THE PEOPLE GO. The <i>vav</i> in <i>ve-lo nacham</i> (led them not) is like an unaspirated <i>fa</i> in the Arabic tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, a <i>vav</i> prefixed to a word does not always mean and. Hence <i>ve-lo nacham</i> does not mean: and led them not, but may mean: that God led them not, or something similar.</i> It is known that the distance between Egypt and Jerusalem by way of the land of the Philistines is not very great. It is about a ten-day journey by straight road. If this was not so, how did the tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob’s sons.</i> come as far as Egypt upon their asses?<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">To buy food. See Gen. 42-44.</i> If the distance was very great how much would have been necessary for them and their asses to eat?<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, if the distance between Egypt and Canaan had been very great they would not have been able to carry enough food with them for the journey.</i> Furthermore, upon returning they brought back food for their households.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">If the distance was very great they would have had to carry a vast amount of food for the journey plus an additional amount for their households.</i>
ALTHOUGH THAT WAS NEAR. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that <i>ki karov hu</i> means <i>although that was near</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>ki</i>, which usually means “for” or “because,” has the meaning of “although” here. Rabbi Moses interprets thus, for <i>prima facie</i>, the word, “because” is out of place here, as God should have led them by the way of the Philistines <span class="underline">because</span> it was close.</i> In my opinion, <i>ki am keshe oref hu</i> (for it is a stiff-necked people) (Ex. 34:9); <i>refa’ah nafshi ki chatati lakh</i> (Heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee) (Ps. 41:5); and <i>ki rekhev barzel lo</i> (though they have chariots of iron) (Josh. 17:18) are similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ki</i> in these verses is to be translated as although. Hence Ex. 34:9 is to be translated, <i>although it is a stiff-necked people</i>; and Ps. 41:5, <i>Heal my soul; although I have sinned against Thee</i>.</i> However, I see no need for this interpretation,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">For interpreting <i>ki</i> here as although.</i> for its meaning is: the reason God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines was that it was close.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ki karov hu</i> is to be rendered, because it was close.</i> God thus led them via a distant way so that they would not witness any war and say, <i>Let us make a captain, and let us return to Egypt</i> (Num. 14:4).
[LEST PERADVENTURE.] We know for certain that the Lord knows the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lest peradventure</i> implies that God was uncertain about the future. This contradicts the concept that the Lord is omniscient, hence I.E.’s comments.</i> God knew that the people would repent if He led them by the way of the land of the Philistines. Scripture reads, <i>Lest peradventure the people repent</i> because the Torah employed human terminology so that those who study<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah.</i> will understand.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">What the Torah is trying to convey. See I.E. on Gen. 1:26.</i>

Verse 18

LED THE PEOPLE ABOUT. <i>Va-yassev</i> (led about)<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>yod</i>, a <i>tzere</i> beneath the <i>samekh</i>, and a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>samekh</i>.</i> is a verb<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>hifil</i>.</i> that comes from a double root.

For a double root in the <i>hifil</i> imperfect may be vocalized <i>pattach tzere</i>, as in <i>yassev</i>, or <i>kamatz segol</i>, as in <i>yasekh, yagel, yasev</i>.</i> Compare, <i>va-yasekh</i> (shut up) in <i>Or who shut up</i> (Job 38:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized <i>kamatz, segol</i>.</i> and <i>va-yagel</i> (and rolled) in <i>and rolled the stone</i> (Gen. 29:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized <i>kamatz, segol</i>.</i> Pay no heed to those who say that the root of <i>va- yassev</i> is <i>nun, samekh, bet</i>.
[THE WILDERNESS.] The word <i>ha-midbar</i> (the wilderness) is to be read as if written twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>ha-midbar yam suf</i>. Now a definite article cannot be prefixed to a word in the construct. Hence I. E. argues that <i>ha-midbar yam suf</i> is short for <i>ha-midbar, midbar yam suf</i>. See Vol. 1, Foreword, p. XV, and I.E. on Gen. 2:9.</i> The clause is to be understood as if written, by the way of the wilderness, wilderness of the Red Sea. Similarly, <i>ha-aron ha-bebrit</i> (the ark of the covenant) (Josh. 3:14) is to be understood as if written, the ark, ark of the covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. 1, p. 54, note 36.</i> and, <i>ve-etz ha-da’at tov va-ra</i> (the tree of the knowledge of good and evil) (Gen. 2:9) as if written, and the tree of the knowledge, knowledge of good and evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. 1, p. 54.</i> Likewise the terms <i>ha-sefer ha-miknah</i> (the deed of the purchase)<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>phraseha-sefer ha-miknah</i>, is short for <i>ha-sefer, sefer ha-miknah</i> (the deed, deed of the purchase).</i> (Jer. 32:12) and <i>ha-yayin ha-chemah</i> (the wine of fury) (Jer. 25:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha-yayin ha-chemah</i> is short for <i>ha-yayin, yen ha-chemah</i> (the wine, wine of fury).</i> There are many other similar instances.
RED SEA. <i>Suf</i> (Red) is the name of a place. Others say that <i>suf</i> comes from the same root as <i>sof</i> (the end)<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yam suf</i> (Red Sea) is a variant of <i>yam sof</i> and means the Sea of the End, that is, the sea which lies at the end of the world.</i> in <i>The end of the matter</i> (Eccles. 12:13). It is so called because it lies at the end of the world. The reference is to the Atlantic, which I have already mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 10:19. Literally, as I have already mentioned.</i> However, this is a major blunder, because the <i>yam suf</i> (Red Sea) lies in the east, opposite Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas the Atlantic does not.</i> The Spanish Sea<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The Mediterranean.</i> is larger than it.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The Red Sea. How much more so the Atlantic, which is greater than the Mediterranean. Hence the Red Sea cannot be identified with the Atlantic.</i>
ARMED. Some say that <i>chamushim</i> (armed) means full of wealth, possessing all that they need. Now Scripture states, <i>neither had they prepared for themselves any victual</i> (Ex. 12:39).<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that they did not have everything they needed.</i> Furthermore, what reason is there to mention this now?<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">That they had provisions. It adds nothing to the account here. Its proper place is in Ex. 12:39.</i> The only meaning of <i>chamushim</i> is, girded with weapons for war. Compare, <i>chalutzim ta’avoru</i> (ye shall pass over armed) (Deut. 3:18), the meaning of which is: ye shall pass over with girded loins.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>chalatz</i> means loins. Therefore, <i>chalutzim ta’avoru</i> literally means: ye shall pass over with loins, i.e., with loins girded with weapons.</i> The fact that Scripture in one place reads, <i>ve-attem ta’averu chamushim</i> (but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed) (Josh. 1:14) and in another place refers to the Israelites as <i>chalutzim</i> (Deut. 3:18) is true witness to the aforementioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>chamushim</i> means armed.</i> What reason was there for them to carry food before their brethren?<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>chamushim</i> means stocked with food then Josh. 1:14 tells us that the tribes of Dan and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh passed over the Jordan before the rest of Israel, carrying food. Now what conceivable reason was there for this? Food carriers or baggage follow behind troops. They do not precede them.</i> The reason Scripture at this point notes <i>that the children of Israel went up armed</i> is that it is previously stated, <i>Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt</i> (v. 17).<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Hence we might assume that they were unarmed.</i> For<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Contrary to what verse 17 might imply.</i> the Israelites went out <i>with a high hand</i> (Ex. 14:8), with weapons of war and not like fleeing slaves.

Verse 19

AND MOSES TOOK THE BONES OF JOSEPH. Scripture mentions above that <i>the children of Israel</i> who were alive in that generation <i>went up out of the land of Egypt</i>. Scripture now notes that the children of Israel also brought up with them the most honored one of them, the one through whom they came down to Egypt. The latter had made them swear before his death that they would tell their children, and their children would instruct their children about this.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">To bring his bones up with them.</i> Now Moses busied himself with fulfilling the oath so that no guilt would fall upon Israel. For we see that the princes of Israel swore an oath to the Gibeonites.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">That they would not harm them. See Josh. 9.</i> Now they only took this oath on condition that the Gibeonites came from a distant place as they claimed.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See Josh. 9:9.</i> After it was found that the Gibeonites came from close by<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">That is, from the land of Canaan.</i> it was fitting that they not keep their oath so that they and all Israel not violate the injunction, <i>thou shalt save alive nothing</i> (Deut. 20:16). However, they kept their oath out of regard for God’s glory so that they not desecrate it.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">As they swore upon God’s name.</i> Many years later God punished the children of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">See II Sam. 21:1.</i> because Saul permitted the Gibeonites who were in Nob, the city of the priests, to be put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi and Kimchi on II Sam. 21:1.</i>
[THE BONES OF JOSEPH.] Scripture mentions <i>the bones of</i><sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than the body of.</i> for all of the flesh and skin breeds worms and putrefies, and after a few years only the bones remain.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. was apparently unaware of the process of mummification.</i>

Verse 20

AND THEY TOOK THEIR JOURNEY…ETHAM. Etham is, as I will explain,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 15:22.</i> the wilderness of Shur.

Verse 21

AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY. We know that the Lord <i>inhabiteth eternity and His name is Holy</i> (Is. 57:15), and that <i>He is enthroned of old. Selah</i> (Ps. 55:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, God is incorporeal, for if He had a body He could not be eternal. This being the case, why does Scripture read, <i>And the Lord <span class="underline">went</span>?</i></i> Scripture speaks in the language of men. It reads so because God’s power went with Israel, as in <i>That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses</i> (Is. 63:12).
[IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD.] Scripture reads, <i>in a pillar of cloud</i> because it was not shaped like other clouds but was in the form of a pillar stretching from the sky upon the earth. A pillar is called an <i>ammud</i><sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>ayin, mem, dalet</i>.</i> in Hebrew because the base (<i>ma’amad</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>ayin, mem, dalet</i>.</i> of the house is on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">An alternative translation is: because the existence (<i>ma’amad</i>) of the house depends on it. See the word <i>ammud</i> in Kimchi’s <i>Sefer Ha-Shorashim</i>. Be that as it may, I.E.’s point is that the passive form <i>ammud</i> (it was stood up), rather than the active <i>omed</i> (stands) is used for a pillar because the house is stood up, i.e., stands/exists (<i>ammud</i>) because of it.</i>
[THAT THEY MIGHT GO BY DAY AND BY NIGHT.] Scripture reads, <i>that they might go by day and by night</i> because the camp was large and they could only journey a short distance.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">At a time.</i> They therefore journeyed part of the day<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a little by day (Cohen).</i> and also part of the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a little by night.</i> These two pillars were, as I shall explain,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 15:22</i> before the Israelites until they came to the sea.

Verse 22

DEPARTED NOT. <i>Yamish</i> (departed) is a transitive verb.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning he caused to depart, the reference being to the Lord mentioned in verse 21. Thus <i>lo yamish ammud he-anan</i> (the pillar of cloud departed not) means: God did not cause the pillar of cloud to depart.</i> For God mentioned above<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 21.</i> did not cause the pillars to depart from before the people.
[BY DAY.] The word <i>yomam</i> (by day) is not found employed in Scripture except for the time when the sun shines upon the earth. The word <i>yom</i> (day) found in the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings refers also to nighttime, for it is written, <i>on the day</i> (yom) <i>that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt</i> (Num. 8:17). Now the slaying of the first-born took place at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 12:29.</i> It is also written, <i>this day</i> (ha-yom) <i>is a day</i> (yom) <i>of good tidings</i> (II Kings 7:9). Now it was then night, for we read there, <i>if we tarry till the morning light</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). Scripture also reads, <i>The day</i> (yom) <i>I cry in the night before Thee</i> (Ps. 88:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i>

Chapter 14



Verse 1

AND THE LORD SPOKE. It is truly not proper for an intelligent person to scrutinize God’s actions and ask, why did the Lord act thus?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, truthfully speaking one can not always fathom God’s will.</i> For all of God’s actions are done wisely. Man’s wisdom is as nothing before God.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 39:6.</i> I mention this because you will read in this Torah portion that God<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Acting like the general of an army.</i> guilefully commanded the Israelites to turn back<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, verses 2 and 3.</i> so that Pharaoh would go out and pursue them, and drown in the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, verse 4.</i> God’s thoughts are very deep.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hence we cannot understand why the Lord chose to destroy Pharaoh and his hosts in this way when he could have killed them with a plague or the like.</i>

Verse 2

PI-HAHIROTH. <i>Pi-hahiroth</i> is elsewhere called <i>Pene-hahiroth</i> (Num. 33:8). It is so called<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">By these two names.</i> because the mouth (<i>peh</i>) is on the face (<i>panim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>pi</i> (mouth of) and <i>pene</i> (face of) interchange.</i> It is the name of a place.
BEFORE BAAL-ZEPHON. Some say that the Egyptian magicians made bronze images which drew power from the stars, and that Baal-zephon was a statue that no slave fleeing Egypt was able to pass by.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They held that Baal-zephon was an image on the border of Egypt which supernaturally prevented fleeing slaves from crossing it.</i> It is because of this that Scripture reads, <i>that the people were fled</i> (v. 5).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Once the Israelites passed Baal-zephon the Egyptians realized that the statue was ineffective against Israel and that the Israelites had fled.</i> However, in my opinion because Moses said to Pharaoh, <i>We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness</i> (Ex. 8:23), it appeared to Pharaoh from these words that Moses knew the road that they would take to the place where they intended to sacrifice. Thus when Pharaoh heard that the Israelites started to go by way of the wilderness,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">To the place where they were going to offer sacrifices.</i> and when they had traveled some distance<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Into the desert away from Egypt.</i> backtracked to go in another way, Pharaoh surmised that everything that Moses had told him was said in guile, that he did not intend to sacrifice but to flee. For one who flees becomes confused on the way and does not know which road to take.
OVER AGAINST IT. The word <i>nikhcho</i> (over against it) is vocalized with a <i>chirik</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than a <i>kamatz katan</i>. The word <i>nikhcho</i> consists of the word <i>nokhach</i> (against) plus the pronominal suffix. In such cases the <i>cholam</i> changes to a <i>kamatz katan</i>. Thus we would expect <i>nokhcho</i> rather than <i>nikhcho</i>, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is similar to the word <i>niflo</i> (was fallen)<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Which should have been vocalized <i>noflo</i>, for <i>niflo</i> consists of the word <i>nofel</i> plus the pronominal suffix.</i> in <i>after that he was fallen</i> (II Sam. 1:10). There are many other such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In which the <i>chirik</i> comes in place of a <i>kamatz katan</i> where a word vocalized with a <i>cholam</i> is combined with a pronominal suffix.</i>

Verse 3

AND PHARAOH WILL SAY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This is similar to <i>say of me</i> (Gen. 20:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>imri li</i> (say of me); literally, say to me. I.E.’s point is that there are instances in which the <i>lamed</i> is to be interpreted to mean of, concerning, about. Thus <i>li-vene yisrael</i> does not mean to the children of Israel but of the children of Israel.</i>
ENTANGLED. <i>Nevukhim</i> (entangled) is vocalized with a <i>shuruk</i> in place of a <i>cholam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The singular form of <i>nevukhim</i> is <i>navokh</i>. Thus we would expect to see <i>nevokhim</i> rather than <i>nevukhim</i>. Compare, <i>nakhon, nekhonim, navon, nevonim</i>.</i> It is similar to the word <i>ta’avuri</i> (pass)<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In which a <i>shuruk</i> comes in place of a <i>sheva</i>. The usual form of the <i>kal</i> feminine imperfect is <i>ta’avri</i>.</i> in <i>neither pass from hence</i> (Ruth 2:8), for <i>nevukhim</i> is a <i>nifal</i> as the word <i>nekhonim</i> (ready) (Ex. 19:11) is.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it should have followed that paradigm and been similarly vocalized. See note 17.</i> Now <i>navokhu</i> (perplexed) (Joel 1:18) and also <i>navokhah</i> (perplexed) in <i>but the city of Shushan was perplexed</i> (Est. 3:15) are like <i>nakhonah</i> (established)<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">They are all <i>nifals</i> and follow the same paradigm. Similarly <i>nevukhim</i> despite its irregular vocalization.</i> in <i>And the kingdom was established</i> (I Kings 2:46). Its meaning is, they are like a person who cannot find anyone to advise him and does not know what to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>nevukhim</i> means perplexed.</i> The <i>nun</i> in <i>nivkhe</i> (depths of) in <i>the depths of the sea</i> (Job 38:16)<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> is a root letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas the <i>nun</i> of <i>nevukhim</i> is not a root letter but the nun of the <i>nifal</i> form. The root of <i>nevukhim</i> is <i>bet, vav, kaf</i> and the root of <i>nivkhe</i> is <i>nun, bet, kaf</i>.</i> The meaning of <i>nivkhe yam</i> (the springs of the sea) is the depths of the sea. <i>Nivkhe</i> has no place here.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Contra Rashi and Rashbam, who connect <i>nevukhim</i> and <i>nivkhe</i>.

THE WILDERNESS HATH SHUT THEM IN. The ways of the wilderness are closed to them, and like fugitives they do not know where to go.

Verse 5

AND IT WAS TOLD THE KING OF EGYPT. That they are not going for any purpose but to flee.

Verse 6

AND CAPTAINS. Note that the king is like the number one.

Verse 9

AND THE EGYPTIANS PURSUED AFTER THEM. This is in keeping with linguistical style.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture to repeat itself in this manner.

Verse 11

AND THEY SAID. We find that the holy tongue employs two words with one meaning back to back when one would suffice. Now the phrase <i>ha-mibbeli en kevarim</i> (because there were no graves)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, because there are no graves, for <i>bli</i> and <i>en</i> mean the same thing.</i> is similar to <i>ha-rak akh be-mosheh</i> (only with Moses?)

Verse 13

STAND STILL, AND SEE THE SALVATION OF THE LORD. For you will not wage war but you shall see the salvation which the Lord will work for you this day. One may ask: How is it that a large camp comprising six hundred thousand armed men were afraid of those who pursued them? Why did they not stand and fight for their own and their children’s lives? The answer is: The Egyptians were masters over Israel. The generation that left Egypt were trained from their youth to bear the yoke of the Egyptians. They were of humble spirit. How then could they now wage war against their masters? The Israelites were lazy and not learned in war. Can you not see that were it not for the prayers of Moses, the Amalekites, who came<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">To attack Israel. See Ex. 17:8-13.</i> with a small number of men, would have defeated Israel. God alone, <i>Who doeth great things</i> (Job 5:9); <i>And by Him actions are weighed</i> (I Sam. 2:3), so arranged events that all Israelite males<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Under the age of 20. See Num. 14:31.</i> who left Egypt died out,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 14:22.</i> for they had no spirit to fight the Canaanites; and a new generation with a noble spirit, who had never tasted exile, arose after the generation of the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The generation that left Egypt and died in the wilderness.</i> I have noted the aforementioned in the account of Moses recorded in the Torah portion <i>Ve-Eleh Shemot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 2:3.</i>

Verse 14

THE LORD WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. <i>Lakhem</i> means for you.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to you, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Similarly, whenever the word war (<i>milchamah</i>) is followed by a <i>lamed</i> it indicates aid. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen therefore explains <i>li</i> (me) in <i>For there are many that fight</i> (lochamim) <i>me</i> (li) <i>on high</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> (Ps. 56:3) to mean for me.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For a <i>lamed</i> follows the word war (<i>lochamim</i>.) According to Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen, Ps. 56:3 should be translated: For there are many that fight on high for me.</i> The meaning of <i>on high</i> is, a war on high, as is the case with all that sit.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">It is unclear what I.E. means. Filwarg suggests emending <i>ha-yoshevim</i> (that sit) to <i>ha-chashuvim</i> (that are important), the idea being that important people have others who fight for them. The verse thus states: For there are many that fight for me on high as is the case with all important people. However, in I.E.’s short commentary the reading is <i>ha-moshekhim</i>, which is a technical term for words that are to be read as if written twice. In this case our verse is to be read as follows: For there are many that fight for me, that fight for me on high, the reference being to angels who fight on his behalf. See I.E. on Ps. 56:3. In this case the last line of I.E. should be interpreted as: The meaning of on high is a war on high, as our verse belongs to those verses in which there is a word that is to be read as if written twice.</i>
AND YE SHALL HOLD YOUR PEACE. In contrast to <i>and the children of Israel cried out</i> (v. 10).

Verse 15

WHEREFORE CRIEST THOU UNTO ME. Some say that Moses was crying out unto the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See Mekhilta and Rashi on this verse: “This teaches us that Moses was standing and praying.”</i> However, this is incorrect, for God had already told Moses, <i>and I will get Me honor upon Pharaoh</i> (v. 4).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Moses knew that God would destroy Pharaoh and his army and would not cry unto the Lord.</i> On the contrary, this was told to Moses who stood in Israel’s stead<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The words were directed to the children of Israel, not to Moses.</i> because the children of Israel cried out to the Lord.
THAT THEY GO FORWARD. Little by little until they reach the edge of the sea.

Verse 16

AND LIFT THOU UP. God told Moses to lift up his rod and divide the sea before the children of Israel went forward.

They arrange the three verses on top of each other and arrive at God’s name by reading down, i.e., <i>vav, vav, vav; yod, yod, yod; samekh, bet, tet</i>, etc. Or they invert verse 20 and arrange the three verses as above and read down, i.e., <i>vav, heh, vav; yod, lamed, yod; samekh, alef, tet</i>, and so on. The reason they invert the middle verse is that it states, <i>and the one did not come near the other all the night</i>; i.e., one is not to combine the letters of this verse in their normal fashion but they are to be read backwards as the word <i>ha-laylah</i> (the night) is. For <i>ha-laylah</i> reads the same whether from left to right or right to left (Krinsky).</i> the sign of the secret of God’s explicit name. However, in my opinion it is so written<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">These three verses. In other words, verses 19-21 consist of 72 letters each, not because a combination of their letters spells out a secret name of God, but rather they allude to God (<i>YHVH</i>) whose might delivered Israel.</i> because, as I will explain in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. insists that when the Talmud speaks of the 72-letter name of God it refers to the tetragrammaton (<i>YHVH</i>),which when calculated as follows, <i>Y</i> (10) <i>YH</i> (15) <i>YHV</i> (21) <i>YHVH</i> (26), comes to 72. Cf. I.E.’s <i>Sefer Ha-Shem</i> 5.</i> the numerical value of God’s glorious name comes to seventy-two. The <i>Book of Raziel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">An early cabalistic work which is supposed to have been given to Adam by the angel Raziel (Hebrew, mystery of God). It contains mystical teachings, letter mysticism, descriptions of heaven, as well as formulas for amulets.</i> states that one who wants to query the heavenly powers in a dream should read the verse, <i>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year</i>, etc. (Ezek. 1:1), for it contains seventy-two letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>Sefer Raziel</i>, and apparently also in I.E’s version of Scripture, the words <i>ha-golah</i> and <i>marot</i> in Ezek. 1:1 were spelled without a <i>vav</i>. Otherwise the number of letters in Ezek 1:1 comes to 74 as they do in our editions of the Prophets. Cf. <i>Minchat Shai</i> on Ezek. 1:1.</i>
THE ANGEL OF GOD. The reference is to the great prince<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The angel Michael. Cf. Dan. 21:1, <i>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of Israel</i>.</i> who goes in the cloud, concerning whom it is written, <i>And the Lord went before them by day</i> (Ex. 13:21). When this angel, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them, the pillar of cloud moved with him. Let the one who identifies the angel of God with the cloud show us where we find the pillar of cloud called the angel of God. Furthermore, if the angel and the pillar are one and the same, why is <i>and the pillar of cloud removed from before them</i> repeated? If he should answer that Scripture repeats the same idea in different words,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">As it often does.</i> then we respond that it is not the manner of Scripture to repeat itself except in prophecy<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Which is given in poetic form.</i> or reproof.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Prophet’s words of reproof.</i> Moreover, it is unfit to repeat oneself when reporting how something happened.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">When prose is employed.

Verse 20

AND IT CAME. And the angel came.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>va-yovo</i>, which may mean: and it came, or, and he came, hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
AND THERE WAS THE CLOUD AND THE DARKNESS HERE. Between the camps.
AND IT LIT UP THE NIGHT.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders this, and he lit up the night, the reference being to the angel who lit up the night via the pillar of fire (Krinsky).</i> As was the manner on all the nights, so that Israel could cross the sea. They crossed it at night. Rabbi Merinus says that the meaning of <i>va-ya’er</i> (he lit up) is, he darkened. <i>And the night shall be light about me</i> (Ps. 139: 11)<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. So too Rashi on Ps. 139:11.</i> is similar. Furthermore, we find, <i>On the light of the fourteenth day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 2a. The meaning of which is, on the night of the fourteenth day, i.e., the night preceding the fourteenth day. We thus see that the word light can refer to night or darkness.</i> in rabbinic literature. However, the one who interprets thus turns darkness into light and light into darkness, for it is impossible in any language for a word to mean both a thing and its opposite unless it is euphemistically used, as in <i>Naboth did bless God and the king</i> (I Kings 21:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. Its meaning is, as J.P.S. translates, <i>Naboth did curse God and the king</i>.</i> The word light in <i>shall be light about me</i> refers to the light itself, as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I.E. on Ps. 139:11.</i> Similarly, the sages said<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 3a.</i> that <i>On the light of the fourteenth</i> is a refined language,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">They did not want to mention darkness.</i> which is similar to a euphemism. Furthermore, what reason was there for Scripture to say, <i>and he darkened the night</i>? It is dark every night. The only meaning of <i>va-ya’er et ha-laylah</i> is that he<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The angel via the pillar of fire (Krinsky).</i> lit up the night<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>va-ya’er et ha-laylah</i> means: and he lit up the night.</i> as he did from the day that Israel went out of Egypt, for the pillar of fire was seen every night. Now if Israel had no light how did they cross the sea?<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Another argument against Rabbi Merinus’ interpretation.</i> For behold, by the time Pharaoh came into the sea and the Lord looked forth upon him in the morning watch, most of the Israelites had already crossed.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Thus most of the Israelites crossed during the night. However, if they had no light how could they have crossed?</i>

Verse 21

AND MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND…ALL THE NIGHT. Even while Israel was crossing, the wind did not cease.

Verse 22

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WENT INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA. Do not think that because Scripture reads, <i>in the midst</i><sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>be-tokh</i> in (the middle), hence I.E.’s comment.</i> <i>of the sea</i> that the Israelites reached the middle of the Red Sea. On the contrary, even if they entered the sea for even half of a Persian mile one may say that they came in the midst of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>tokh</i> is not to be taken literally.</i> It is like <i>And the mixed multitude that was in the midst of them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Num. 11:4), for the mixed multitude was not in the middle of the camp. The meaning of <i>the midst of the sea</i> is, the place where there was water at the beginning of the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Not literally in the midst of the sea.</i>
AND THE WATERS WERE A WALL UNTO THEM. The waters froze.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">The waters on either side of the Israelites froze and formed two solid walls (Krinsky, Cohen).</i> It is also written, <i>The floods stood upright as a heap</i> (Ex. 15:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea</i>.</i> After most of Israel crossed, the waters which formed a wall for them melted. This is the meaning of <i>that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians</i> (v. 26). These waters<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Which formed from the melting walls.</i> separated between the Egyptians and the dry land.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">That the Israelites were on.</i> It therefore states, <i>and the Egyptians fled against it</i> (v. 27), as the Egyptians thought that they would go out onto dry land.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">The dry land that the Israelites were on.</i> But the walls of water melted and separated them and dry land. There is no doubt that those who pursued Israel saw the light by which Israel crossed.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they saw the Israelites on dry land and wanted to follow them.</i>

Since the sender commands his agent to commit an act, it is as if the sender himself had executed it.
THROUGH THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND OF CLOUD. Between these two pillars.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Contra Rashi, who interprets the <i>bet</i> of <i>be-ammud</i> (through the pillar) to mean with; i.e., God threw the Egyptians into confusion through the use of the two pillars.

AND DISCOMFITED. Possibly because of this the poet says, <i>The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind</i> (Ps. 77:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>va-yaham</i> (discomfited) refers to a discomfit brought about by lightning and thunder.

Be that as it may, this verse shows that the root <i>heh, mem, mem</i> refers to discomfit brought about by thunder and lightning (Weiser).</i> (Ps. 18:15).

He wanted to turn his chariot around and flee. In this case, “and he rebelled” means: and he turned the wheels of his chariot around.

FLED AGAINST IT.

May the bones of Chivi<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Chivi Al-Balkhi, a Persian Bible exegete born in Balkh (now in Afghanistan) who lived in the latter part of the 9th century.

By inverting the letters of Ha-Balkhi from Balakh, we get <i>ha-kalbi</i> (the dog).</i> be crushed. Chivi said that Moses knew the time of low tide, when the level of the sea goes down, and the time of high tide, when the sea comes in and its level rises, and so brought his people across the sea when the tide was normally low. However, Pharaoh did not know the manner of the sea and therefore drowned. This interpretation is sheer madness, as the sea is not normally dry in any place when its level goes down. However, all was dry.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">According to verse 29 Israel crossed on dry land.</i> Neither do walls of water remain on the right or the left.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">When the sea retreats at low tide.</i> Furthermore, the end of low tide and the beginning of high tide do not become clear until some hours have passed.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">It takes some hours before the effects of high and low tide are perceptible.

AND THE LORD OVERTHREW. <i>Va-yena’er</i> (overthrew) is a <i>pi’el.

Indeed, the poet says, <i>There was not one of them</i> (echad me-hem) <i>left</i> (Ps. 106: 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that <i>ad echead</i> means so much as one.</i>

Verse 29

BUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The reason this is noted a second time<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">After already noting it in verse 22.</i> is that there remained some Israelites who were still crossing the sea while Pharaoh was drowning. This was a miracle within a miracle, for in the place where the Israelites were crossing the sea there was a strong east wind drying<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The sea.</i> and where Pharaoh and his host were, God brought another wind to melt the waters that were frozen and formed walls. There were thus two winds in two places in the sea close to one another.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">At the same time.</i> True proof that this interpretation is correct is offered by the statement in the Song of Moses, <i>And with the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were piled up</i> (Ex. 15:8), which speaks of the wind that blew for Israel; and the statement, <i>Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them</i> (Ex. 15:10), which speaks of the wind that caused the Egyptians to drown. It is because of this that the end of the song reads, <i>and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea</i> (Ex. 15:19). Do not ask, how could all of Israel cross in one night? Did not the six hundred thousand men on foot<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Who left Egypt. See Ex. 12:37. They were married and had children. Additionally, a mixed multitude went up with them.</i> make up only a quarter of the camp?<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Israelites. The reading in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 is: For the six hundred thousand men on foot did not make up even a quarter of the camp.</i> Perhaps they passed over some other way.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh only pursued the 600,000 armed men. The rest continued along on an overland road and eventually joined up with the group that crossed over (Filwarg). See the rest of I.E.’s comments.</i> Or perhaps the sea split into twelve parts, as the sages of blessed memory say.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</i> 42; <i>Tanchuma, Be-Shallach</i> 10; <i>Mekhilta, Be-Shallach</i> 4.</i> Now the Israelites did not cross the width of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on verse 22.</i> On the contrary, they moved along its length and came out in the wilderness of Shur from wherein, as I will explain, they entered the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 15:22.</i>

Verse 30

THUS THE LORD SAVED. Now the Israelites were saved from the hand of the Egyptians. Until now the fear of Pharaoh was upon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites dreaded Pharaoh until they saw the Egyptian corpses.</i> Scripture tells us that the Egyptians drowned in the sea. The sea did not cast their bodies out upon the dry land,<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Contra Rashi and <i>Mekhilta</i> on this verse, and <i>Pesachim</i> 118b.</i> for it is clearly written, <i>The earth swallowed them</i> (Ex. 15:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the sea bed swallowed them (Krinsky).</i> The meaning of <i>and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore</i><sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies that the sea cast them out.</i> therefore is: when the Egyptians drowned, the Israelites, who were on the shore, saw their dead bodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Before they sank.</i>

Verse 31

FEARED. When Israel saw this great blow they feared God, as in <i>And David was afraid of the Lord that day</i> when Uzzah who put forth his hand to the ark of God died (II Sam. 6:9).
AND THEY BELIEVED IN THE LORD. They believed that the Lord is truth<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Unchanging and Ultimate Being. Cf. <i>Mishneh Torah, Mada</i> 1:3,4: “The Truth of His being is incomparable to the truth of any other individual being…He alone is the Truth, and no other being possesses a truth similar to His Truth.”</i> and that Moses is His servant and will do only that which the Lord commands him to do.

Chapter 15



Verse 1

THEN SANG MOSES. It is Hebrew style to employ an imperfect preceded by the word <i>az</i> (then) in place of a perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Az yashir mosheh</i> (then sang Moses) literally means: then Moses will sing. I.E. points out that an imperfect preceded by the word <i>az</i> occasionally has the meaning of a perfect. Similarly, in the next three verses cited by I.E. verbs that are in the imperfect are to be translated as perfects, for the imperfects are preceded by the word <i>az</i>.</i> Compare, <i>Az yivneh shelomoh</i> (then did Solomon build) (I Kings 11:7);<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yivneh</i> is an imperfect that means will build. Thus <i>az yivneh shelomoh</i> literally means: then will Solomon build.</i> <i>az yedabber yehoshu’a</i> (then spoke Joshua) (Josh. 10:12);<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yedabber</i> is an imperfect that means will speak. Therefore <i>az yedabber yehoshu’a</i> literally means: then will Joshua speak.</i> az <i>yavdil mosheh</i> (then Moses separated) (Deut. 4:41).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yavdil</i> is an imperfect that means will separate. Thus <i>az yavdil mosheh</i> means: then Moses will separate.</i> The same is true in Arabic. Moses composed the song by himself. He then taught it to all of Israel, each one of whom then sang and said, <i>I will sing unto the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the song is in the singular even though the verb which introduces it reads, <i>va-yomeru</i> (and spoke), which literally means: and they spoke. <i>Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song</i> may be interpreted to mean that Moses and Israel simultaneously broke into song. However, this interpretation is untenable, as it is impossible for a whole nation to know the contents of a song without first being taught its words. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> <i>And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people</i> (Deut. 27:1) is similar. The commandment was first spoken only by Moses. The elders of Israel then repeated it to everyone.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For Moses and the elders did not simultaneously command the people.</i>
AND SPOKE, SAYING.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, <i>lemor</i> (saying). <i>Lemor</i> is used when a statement is directed to someone. However, what follows is a hymn, hence I.E.’s comment. Cf. Filwarg.</i> Each one of the Israelites was to say the following, or the following was to be said in every generation.
FOR HE IS HIGHLY EXALTED. He demonstrated His exaltation by casting both the mighty rider and his exalted and powerful steed into the sea as one casts an arrow. The meaning of <i>ramah</i> (thrown) in <i>ramah va-yam</i> (hath He thrown into the sea) is similar to the word <i>rome</i> (throws) in <i>armed with that which a bow throws</i> (Ps. 78:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i>

Verse 2

THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH AND SONG. Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi.</i> of blessed memory says that there is a difference between <i>ozzi</i> (my strength), which is vocalized with a furtive <i>kamatz</i>, and <i>uzzi</i>, which is vocalized with a <i>kubbutz</i>. He therefore says that the <i>yod</i> in <i>ozzi</i> (my strength) in <i>the Lord is my strength and song</i> is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi the <i>yod</i> of <i>ozzi</i> is not a first person pronominal suffix. The word <i>ozzi</i> has the same meaning as the word <i>oz</i>. It means strength. Cf. Rashi’s comment on this verse.</i> However, Rabbi Solomon does not offer another such instance.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Actually Rashi does. He offers <i>ha-yoshevi</i> (enthroned) and <i>shokheni</i> (dwelt), the <i>yods</i> of both of which are superfluous. Cf. Filwarg. If this is what I.E. meant then he must have quoted Rashi from memory and erred. However, it is possible that what I.E. means is that Rashi offered no other instance of two words ending in a <i>yod</i> coming from the same root, one word vocalized with a <i>kubbutz,</i> the other with a <i>kamatz,</i> with the <i>yod</i> of one superfluous and the <i>yod</i> of the other a first person pronominal suffix.</i> Rabbi Solomon goes on to say that <i>ve-zimrat</i> (and song) is in the construct with <i>Yah</i> (the Lord). He interprets our verse as if it read: The strength and vengeance<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi <i>ve-zimrat</i> (and song) is to be rendered, and vengeance. Rashi connects <i>ve-zimrat</i> to <i>zamar,</i> which means to prune or cut.

Verse 3

THE LORD IS A MAN OF WAR. The Lord supports those who love Him and cleave unto Him and He is a man of war to their enemies.
[MAN.] The word <i>ish</i> (man) means a being.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Or an entity. I.E. makes a similar point in his comments on Gen 15:10. Translating <i>ish</i> as a being obviously eliminates an anthropomorphism.</i> Scripture thus states in reference to the stars, <i>ish lo nedar</i> (not one faileth) (Is. 40:26); and in reference to the living creatures, <i>ish el ever panav yelekhu</i> (they went every one straight forward) (Ezek. 1:9); and in reference to the angels, <i>ve-ha-ish gavriel</i> (the man Gabriel) (Dan. 9:21). The meaning of <i>ish milchamah</i> (a man of war) thus is, a being who wages war. It is similar to the term <i>ish emunim</i> (a faithful man) (Prov. 20:6), the meaning of which is, a being<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

THE LORD IS HIS NAME. His name will now be known. Compare, <i>That calleth for the waters of the sea, And poureth them out upon the face of the earth; The Lord is His name</i> (Amos 5:8). He alone can do such a thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">After God does a wondrous thing people speak of it and His name thus becomes known.</i>

Verse 4

PHARAOH’S CHARIOTS. God, as it were, cast Pharaoh’s heavy chariots and their hosts as if they were a light arrow.
[AND HIS CHOSEN CAPTAINS.] Moses made mention of <i>his chosen captains</i> “who were over all them”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 14:7.</i> because he had previously spoken of Pharaoh’s hosts.
[THE RED SEA.] Yefet<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See notes on I.E.

For reeds and rushes grow around the <i>yam suf</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the meaning of <i>yam suf</i> is the Sea of Flags or the Sea of Reeds.</i> and not around other seas.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This is Yefet’s assumption.</i> However, Rabbi Joshua says that <i>suf</i> is the name of a city.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the meaning of <i>yam suf</i> is the Sea of Suf.</i> It is like <i>yam kinneret</i> (the sea of Chinnereth) (Josh. 13:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Chinnereth was the name of a city.

Verse 6

GLORIOUS. The <i>yod</i> of <i>nedari</i> (glorious) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">It has no meaning.

Verse 7

AND IN THE GREATNESS OF THY EXCELLENCE. Which is superior to all who exalt themselves. You are able to shatter (overthrow) those that rise up against You. You need no iron weapons to shatter them. All You have to do is send forth Your wrath and <i>it consumeth them as stubble, for God’s wrath</i> is as hot as fire.

Verse 8

AND WITH THE BLAST OF THY NOSTRILS. You rebuke the waters and they congeal. Compare, <i>By the breath of God they perish</i> (Job 4:9).
THE WATERS WERE PILED UP. The word <i>ne’ermu</i> (were piled up) is similar to the word <i>aremat</i> (a heap of) in <i>a heap of wheat</i> (Cant. 7:3).
THE FLOODS STOOD UPRIGHT AS A HEAP. The waters, whose nature is to flow and descend, turned into a heap (<i>ned</i>), as in <i>And rose up in one heap</i> (ned) (Josh. 4:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the waters of the Jordan that split so that Israel could enter Canaan.</i> The meaning of <i>ned</i> (heap) is a wall.

IN THE HEART OF THE SEA. The heart lies in the middle of the body from the point of view of the body’s width.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>In the heart of the sea</i> thus means in the midst of the sea.</i>

Verse 9

THE ENEMY SAID. The reference is to Pharaoh.
[SHALL BE SATISFIED UPON THEM.] The word <i>timla’emo</i> (shall be satisfied upon them) is difficult.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Here. For the suffix <i>mo</i> in <i>timla’emo</i> means them. Hence our verse literally reads, My soul will fill them (or satisfy them). However, this was not Pharaoh’s intention. Pharaoh’s intention was to be full of their wealth. Hence our text should have read: My soul will be full <span class="underline">of</span> them; i.e., I will be full of their wealth.</i> Rabbi Merinus explains that <i>timla’emo nafshi</i> (my lust shall be satisfied upon them) means: my person<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nafshi</i> (my lust) may also be translated as, my person or my soul.</i> shall be full of them;<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, even though the suffix <i>mo</i> means them we can interpret it to mean from them or of them. We can thus interpret <i>timla’emo</i> to mean full of them rather than will fill them.</i> i.e., I will take all of their wealth. The term <i>timla’emo</i> is to be understood like the term <i>yetza’uni</i> (gone forth of me)<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The suffix <i>ni</i> means me. Thus <i>yetza’uni</i> literally means: gone forth me. However, this is not the meaning of the word in the context of the verse. Its meaning is, gone forth of me. We thus see that Scripture sometimes employs a direct object suffix with the meaning of an indirect object. The same is true of <i>timla’emo.</i></i> in <i>My children are gone forth of me</i> (Jer. 10:20). Its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Timla’emo nafshi.</i></i> is connected to <i>I will divide the spoil</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, I will be full of them means: I will be full of their spoils.</i> Others say that <i>timla’emo</i> is used in the same sense as the word <i>me’lo’o</i> (presume)<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>mem, lamed, alef</i> doesn’t only mean to fill. It also means to presume. In our verse it is used in the latter sense.</i> in <i>that durst presume in his heart</i> (Esth. 7:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>timla’emo</i> means: will carry out my intentions. Hence <i>timla’emo nafshi</i> means: I will carry out my intentions upon them or, according to J.P.S., <i>my lust shall be satisfied upon them.</i></i>
[MY HAND SHALL DESTROY THEM.] After doing the latter<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Satisfying his lust upon them.</i> I shall destroy them.
MY HAND SHALL DESTROY THEM. <i>Torishemo</i> means shall destroy them.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>torishemo</i> is <i>yod, resh, shin.</i> This root also has the meaning of to inherit, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Similarly the word <i>torishu</i> (you will destroy) in <i>But if you will not destroy</i> (Num. 34:55).<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i>

Verse 10

THOU DIDST BLOW WITH THY WIND. <i>Nashafta</i> (Thou didst blow) comes from the same root as <i>neshef</i> (night). The meaning of <i>nashafta ve-ruchakha</i> (Thou didst blow with Thy wind) is: You brought a wind at night that drowned them.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>nashafta ve-ruchakha</i> literally means: you “nighted” with a wind.</i>
THEY SANK. <i>Tzalelu</i> (they sank) comes from the same root as <i>metzolot</i> (depths). Compare, <i>My lips quivered</i> (tzalelu) <i>at the voice</i> (Hab. 3:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">This comment presents a problem. If <i>tzalelu</i> is the verbal form of <i>metzolot</i> (depths) then its meaning is, they sank. This being the case, what connection is there between <i>tzalelu</i> in our verse and <i>tzalelu</i> in Hab. 3:16, which means quivered? Krinsky suggests reading <i>metzilot</i> (bells, cymbals) (Zech. 14:20) rather than <i>metzolot</i> (depths). Indeed, I.E. connects <i>tzalelu</i> in Hab. 3:16 to <i>metziltayim</i> (cymbals). According to Krinsky we should read, “<i>Tzalelu</i> (they sank) comes from the same root as <i>metzilot</i> (bells, cymbals).” In other words, <i>tzalelu</i> means they tingled, and the meaning of our verse is, they tingled like lead in the mighty waters; i.e., they cried and shrieked as they drowned as if they were lead cymbals. The point is, they did not die quietly.</i>
IN THE MIGHTY WATERS. This is connected to <i>they sank.</i> Our verse is to be read as if written: they sank<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">If we accept Krinsky’s emendation then we should render, they tingled.</i> as lead in the mighty waters.
AS LEAD. <i>Oferet</i> (lead) comes from the same root as <i>afar</i> (dust).<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Its root being <i>ayin, peh, resh.</i></i> If one puts any of the six kinds of metal<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">For the six other metals see I.E. on Ex. 3:15 and the notes thereto.</i> in the ground each will lose one of its familiar elements in a given number of years.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">They decompose in the ground.</i> However, lead will always maintain itself.

GLORIOUS IN HOLINESS. The reference is to the Throne of Glory.
[FEARFUL IN PRAISES, DOING WONDERS.] For all who want to acclaim God are afraid to praise His name because who can recite all of His praises. However, they are obligated to praise Him because He alone does wonders.

Verse 12

Literally, what is the wonder?</i> were manifest when You stretched forth Your hand from the highest realm of the celestial heights where Your name is exalted, and the ground which is beneath all earthly creatures swallowed up the enemy of Israel.

[THY RIGHT HAND.] Its meaning is, Thy strength.

Verse 13

THOU IN THY LOVE HAST LED. Moses used the perfect <i>nachita</i> (led) in place of the imperfect,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The verse speaks of God bringing Israel to His holy habitation.

THOU HAST LED. <i>Nehalta</i> (thou hast led) is similar to <i>etnahalah</i> (I will journey) in <i>I will lead on</i><sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. renders journey.</i> <i>gently</i> (Gen. 33:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the root <i>nun, heh, lamed</i> means to lead.</i>

PANGS HAVE TAKEN HOLD ON THE INHABITANTS OF PHILISTIA. The inhabitants of the land of Philistia.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Philistia is short for the land of Philistia. <i>Peleshet</i> (Philistia) is the name of a nation, hence I.E.’s comment that here it refers to their country (Krinsky).</i> The word inhabitants indicates this.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">It indicates that Scripture speaks of a country.</i>

Verse 15

THE MIGHTY MEN. <i>Ele</i> (mighty men) spelled with a <i>yod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">As it is in our verse.</i> means sheep,<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Or rams.

[THEN WERE THE CHIEFS OF EDOM AFFRIGHTED…THE MIGHTY MEN OF MOAB, TREMBLING TAKETH HOLD UPON THEM.] The Philistines, the Edomites, and the Moabites did not wage war with the Israelites in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on verse 14.</i>
ALL THE INHABITANTS OF CANAAN ARE MELTED AWAY.

Verse 16

TERROR AND DREAD FALLETH UPON THEM. This refers to Edom and Moab even though Canaan is mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Canaan is the last mentioned in verse 15.</i> <i>He spoke unto them in a pillar of cloud</i> (Ps. 99:79) is, as I have explained, similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>He spoke unto them</i> refers only to Moses and Aaron even though Samuel is also mentioned in the verse. See I.E. on Gen. 20:17 and Ex. 7:7.</i> Likewise, <i>and shed the blood of war in peace</i> (I Kings 2:5) only refers to Abner.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Not to Amasa, although both are mentioned in the verse.</i> So too, <i>and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they bore children</i> refers to Abimelech’s wife and handmaids.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Not to Abimelech.

Moses repeated <i>Till Thy people pass</i> because they circled Mount Seir for many days.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 2:1.</i>
[THOU HAST GOTTEN.] Its meaning is: they were slaves in Egypt and Thou hast gotten them to be Your servants.

Verse 17

THOU BRINGEST THEM IN, AND PLANTEST THEM IN THE MOUNTAIN OF THINE INHERITANCE. A prayer that Israel remain long in the land and not be exiled from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">As a tree takes root in the ground and remains there permanently, hence the use of the term <i>titta’emo</i> (plantest them).</i> Our verse is like <i>in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it</i> (Ezek. 17:23).
IN THE MOUNTAIN. <i>The goodly hill country and Lebanon</i> (Deut. 3:25)<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>the goodly mountain and Lebanon. In the mountain</i> thus refers to the land of Canaan, which is mountainous.</i> is similar. Or it alludes to Mount Moriah.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">The mountain in Jerusalem upon which the Holy Temple was built.</i> It is therefore followed by <i>The place, O Lord, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in.</i>
[WHICH THOU HAST MADE.] Its meaning is: which Thou hast prepared as a place for a sanctuary for Thyself.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">The verse literally reads, a place for a dwelling Thou hast made. I.E. thus explains that the word order has to be rearranged. He then interprets the rearranged word order.</i> The place mentioned lies opposite the glorious celestial place,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mekhilta</i> Ex. 10, “The Sanctuary below is directly opposite the Throne above.” Also see Jerusalem Talmud <i>Berakhot</i> 4:5 and Rashi.</i> for the places on earth vary in accordance with the star that is over them.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of the rabbinic text quoted in the previous note.

I.E. believed that the Temple was under the influence of the sphere wherein all the stars are embedded. Hence its site was the most important place on earth (Krinsky).</i>
[THE SANCTUARY.] The word <i>mikkedash</i> (sanctuary)<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse, which has a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>kof.</i></i> has the same meaning as <i>mikdash</i> (sanctuary).<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Which does not have a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>kof</i> but has one in the <i>dalet</i>. <i>Mikdash</i> is the form for sanctuary used throughout Scripture. The form <i>mikkedash</i> is found only here.</i> The word <i>mittoharo</i> (his brightness) in <i>Thou hast made his brightness to cease</i> (Ps. 89:45) is similar, as the <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>tet</i> is superfluous, like the <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>kof</i> of <i>mikkedash</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>mem</i> in <i>mittoharo,</i> like the <i>mem</i> of <i>mikkedash,</i> is a form <i>mem</i> and not a prepositional <i>mem.</i> Hence the <i>dagesh</i> following it, like the <i>dagesh</i> which follows the <i>mem</i> in <i>mikdash,</i> is superfluous. If the <i>mem</i> of <i>mittoharo</i> or <i>mikkedash</i> was a preposition then the <i>dagesh</i> following it would not be superfluous, for it would be in place of a <i>nun.</i> For the prepositional <i>mem</i> is in place of the word <i>min</i> (from).</i> The <i>dalet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>mikkedash.</i></i> does not receive a <i>dagesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>A dagesh kal,</i> as does the <i>dalet</i> of <i>mikdash.</i></i> because the <i>kof</i><sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>mikkedash.</i></i> is vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Because of its <i>dagesh.</i> A <i>dagesh kal</i> follows a <i>sheva nach</i> (quiescent <i>sheva</i>). It does not follow a mobile <i>sheva</i> (<i>sheva na</i>). Hence <i>mikdash,</i> which is vocalized with a quiescent <i>sheva,</i> has a <i>dagesh</i> in its <i>dalet</i> whereas <i>mikkedash,</i> which is vocalized with a mobile <i>sheva,</i> does not.</i> With the exception of the form <i>shetayim</i> we do not find it to be the way of Scripture to place a <i>dagesh</i> in a word which follows a mobile <i>sheva.</i> I have already noted its grammatical uniqueness.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary on the letter <i>nun,</i> in the <i>Sefer Ha-Tzachot,</i> I.E. notes that <i>shetayim</i> is the only word in Hebrew in which a <i>sheva na</i> is followed by a word with a <i>dagesh.</i></i>
WHICH THY HANDS HAVE ESTABLISHED. Its meaning is similar to <i>thou hast made,<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established</i> is the same as <i>The place, O Lord, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in.</i></i></i> for Scripture repeats itself.

Verse 18

THE LORD SHALL REIGN. God’s Kingship will be seen when the Holy Temple<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in the previous verse.</i> which will be dedicated to His name shall be built.
[FOR EVER AND EVER.] <i>Le-olam va-ed</i> (for ever and ever)<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, forever and until.</i> is an abridgment. The full form is <i>le-olam ve-ad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-ed</i> is a variant of <i>ve-ad.</i></i> <i>olam</i> (for ever and until ever). Do not be amazed that the word <i>ed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>le-olam va-ed.</i></i> is not in the construct,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">With another word.

It is the custom of Hebrew to vocalize a <i>vav</i> with a <i>pattach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a <i>kamatz.</i> I.E. occasionally refers to the <i>kamatz</i> as a <i>pattach</i> (Krinsky).</i> when the syllable which follows it is accented.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the word reads <i>va-ed</i> rather than <i>ve-ed.</i></i> Compare, <i>va-ez</i> (or goat) in <i>of ox, or sheep, or goat</i> (Lev. 7:23). It is for this reason that <i>va-ed</i> is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a <i>kamatz.</i></i> Now Scripture reads, <i>va-okhal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized with a <i>pattach.</i></i> <i>mi-kol</i> (I have eaten of all) (Gen. 27:33). However, at the end of a verse it reads, <i>ha-nachash hishi’ani va-okhel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized with a <i>tzere.</i> In other words, the <i>pattach</i> changes to a <i>tzere</i> at the end of a sentence. Similarly, the word <i>ad</i> is vocalized <i>ed</i> at the end of a sentence.</i> (the serpent beguiled me, and I did eat) (Gen. 3:13). Hence the statement, <i>le-olam va-ed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>le-olam va-ad.</i></i>

Verse 19

FOR THE HORSES OF PHARAOH. This verse is, in my opinion, part of the song.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it is in prose. It was for the latter reason that Nahmanides does not interpret it as part of the song. See Nahmanides and Shadal on this verse.</i> Its purpose is to recall the wonder within the wonder,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Namely, that Israel was crossing the Red Sea at the same time that the Egyptians were drowning.</i> which I have noted.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 14:29.</i>
[UPON THEM.] Upon them refers to <i>the horses of Pharaoh…his chariots and his horsemen.</i> It also includes Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Contrary to the Midrashic opinion that Pharaoh survived.</i> For Scripture clearly states, <i>The enemy</i> (Pharaoh) <i>said</i> (v. 9) and then goes on to say, <i>The earth swallowed them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture thus clearly states that Pharaoh drowned.</i> (v. 12). Furthermore, it is explicitly written, <i>But</i> (God) <i>overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea</i> (Ps. 136:15).

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

AND MOSES LED. I believe that the pillar of cloud, and likewise the pillar of fire, that went before the people when they left Egypt was to ensure that Israel was able to <i>go by day and by night</i> (Ex. 13:21). After Pharaoh and his hosts drowned, Israel was no longer frightened and did not travel at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they no longer needed the pillars.</i> Indeed, we do not find it recorded in the Torah portion <i>Be-Halotekha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">In which we find a description of Israel’s journey. See Num. 8:15-22.</i> that Israel journeyed at night. Behold, Moses now led the people according to God’s command.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Moses rather than the pillars now guided Israel. It is I.E.’s opinion that the pillars led Israel from the time they left Egypt till they came to the Red Sea, and that from the Red Sea to Sinai Moses led Israel. When the Tabernacle was erected the pillars of cloud and fire descended upon it, and the pillar of cloud once again led Israel. See I.E.’s short commentary on Ex. 13:21.</i> There are only six journeys from the Red Sea until Mount Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Listed in Num. 33:14,15.</i> lasting less than forty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Israel journeyed from the Red Sea on the 21st of Nisan until the first of Sivan when they came to the desert of Sinai.</i> The air<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">At that time of year in the wilderness.</i> is then good. It is neither humid nor cold. He who does not have a tent can live outdoors<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">At this time of year.</i> without harm. When Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai they all erected booths,<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">As I.E. goes on to explain, they were informed by Moses that they would spend the fall and winter at Sinai.</i> as they camped there for about year. Moses informed them that they would tarry there until they constructed the Tabernacle. It was for this reason that, as I will explain,<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 25:5.</i> Israel brought out acacia wood from Egypt. The festival of booths was established in commemoration of the booths that Israel made there, for Scripture states, <i>that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt</i> (Lev. 23:43). How can one maintain that Israel dwelt in clouds?<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Ishmael the booths spoken of in Lev. 23:43 refer to the “clouds of glory.” Cf. <i>Sukkah</i> 34:4. I.E. disagrees.</i> For the booths do not resemble clouds.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">For an explanation of Rabbi Ishmael’s opinion see Nahmanides on Lev. 24:43.</i> I will yet explain why the festival of Sukkot is observed in the seventh month.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Lev. 23:43.</i> When the Tabernacle was erected God descended upon it in a pillar of cloud, as it is clearly written, <i>and there was fire therein by night</i> (Ex. 40:38). When the cloud journeyed the children of Israel went onward (Ex. 40:36). It is because of this that Scripture reads, <i>and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day</i> (Num. 14:14). There were thus two interchanging pillars<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">A pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</i> over the Tabernacle. If the statement to the effect that there were seven interchanging pillars over the Tabernacle<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta, Be-Shallach</i> 1.</i> is based on tradition, then we will rely on tradition and set aside our own opinions.
INTO THE WILDERNESS OF SHUR. This is the very wilderness of Etham.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 13:20. I.E. insists that the wilderness of Shur is to be identified with the wilderness of Etham because he wants to harmonize verses 22 and 23 with Num. 33:8. For the latter states, <i>and</i> (Israel) <i>passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.</i> See I.E.’s comments on verse 23.</i> Perhaps there were two cities in the wilderness that were so called.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">One named Shur and the other Etham. The wilderness was named after these cities. At times it is called after one, at other times after the other.</i> Or the wilderness had two names.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Shur and Etham.</i> <i>And they went three days in the wilderness,</i> the reference being to the wilderness of Shur, is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">That the desert had two names, Shur and Etham. For, the line <i>and they went three days in the wilderness</i> (of Shur) is parallel to <i>and they went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham</i> (Num. 33:8).</i> Therefore to indicate this<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">That the desert spoken of is Shur.</i> the <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-midbar</i> (in the wilderness), which precedes <i>and found no water,</i> was vocalized for emphasis with a <i>pattach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Which indicates the subject, i.e., the wilderness mentioned earlier in the verse, namely, the wilderness of Shur. Cf. <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38.</i> 

Verse 23

AND WHEN THEY CAME TO MARAH. It is elsewhere written, <i>And they journeyed from the Red Sea</i> (Num. 33:11). The latter is similar to <i>And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Num. 33:11 and Ex. 15:22 refer to the same event.</i> (<i>and they went out into the wilderness of Shur and came to Marah</i>) (v. 22). We similarly find, <i>and they went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah</i> (Num. 33:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the wilderness of Shur is to be identified with the wilderness of Etham.</i>

Verse 24

AND THE PEOPLE MURMURED. <i>Va-yillonu</i> (murmured) is a <i>nifal.</i> It is similar to <i>ve-yikkonu</i> (shall be established)<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a <i>nifal</i> and is similarly vocalized.</i> in <i>And thy thoughts shall be established</i> (Prov. 16:3), which comes from the same root as <i>nakhonu</i> (prepared) (Prov. 19:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which is <i>kaf, vav, nun.</i> Similarly, the root of <i>va-yillonu</i> is <i>lamed, vav, nun.</i></i> It comes from a double root<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">A two-letter root. That is, its root is <i>lamed, vav, nun.</i> However, the <i>vav</i> is usually dropped in the conjugation. Hence it appears to have only two letters (Weiser, Krinsky).</i> or from a root in which the middle letter is missing.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">That is, its root may be described as a double root or as a root in which the middle letter is dropped.</i> If it came from a root which begins with a <i>nun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nun, lamed, nun.</i> I.E. makes this point because there is a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>lamed.</i> Now one might argue that the <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>lamed</i> is not the <i>dagesh</i> of the <i>nifal</i> conjugation but rather a <i>dagesh</i> that compensates for a missing <i>nun,</i> as in <i>va-yippelu</i> from the root <i>nun, peh, lamed.</i></i> it would have followed the paradigm of <i>va-yiggashu</i> (came near) (Gen. 45:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it would have been conjugated as a root whose first letter is a <i>nun.</i> However, it is not. Hence it has to be taken as an <i>ayin vav</i> in the <i>nifal.</i></i>

Verse 25

AND HE CRIED UNTO THE LORD; AND THE LORD SHOWED HIM A TREE. We do not know what type of tree this was.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Contrary to the rabbis in the Midrash who identify the tree as a willow, olive, pomegranate, or date tree. See <i>Mekhilta, Be-Shallach</i> 1; <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> on Ex. 15:25.</i> What happened can only be described as a miracle. If the waters were stationary<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">If we knew for a fact that Scripture deals with water gathered in a pool or the like.</i> then we would say that they were medicinally sweetened.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">However, it is equally possible that our text deals with running water.

THERE HE MADE FOR THEM. God<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote"><i>He</i> might be taken to refer to Moses, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> for Israel.
A STATUTE AND AN ORDINANCE. To discipline them and to instruct them.
[AND THERE HE PROVED THEM.] This is to be understood in the manner of <i>for the Lord your God putteth you to proof, to know whether ye do love the Lord your God with all you heart and with all your soul</i> (Deut. 13:4). Scripture similarly states, <i>And He afflicted thee,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the lack of water which the Israelites suffered.</i> <i>and suffered thee to hunger</i> (Deut. 8:3); <i>and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end</i> (Deut. 8:16),<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Which is preceded by <i>that He might afflict thee.</i></i> that is, to do good to those who did not murmur against Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">To those who showed their love for God by not murmuring against Moses.</i>

Verse 26

AND HE SAID: IF THOU WILT DILIGENTLY HEARKEN. I have already noted that when the word <i>shema</i> (hearken) is followed by a <i>lamed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">As in our verse where the word <i>le-kol</i> (to the voice of) follows <i>shamo’a tishma</i> (diligently hearken).</i> or a <i>bet</i> it does not mean to hear the words being spoken but rather to understand the subject which is being verbalized. <i>Shema</i> in our verse thus means to understand what the Lord commands us to do.
AND WILT DO THAT WHICH IS RIGHT IN HIS EYES. This refers to the positive commandments.
AND WILT GIVE EAR TO HIS COMMANDMENTS. To understand what the negative commandments consist of.
AND KEEP ALL HIS STATUTES. Not to violate them. Compare, <i>And ye shall not walk in the statutes</i><sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. renders customs.</i> <i>of the nation</i> (Lev. 20:23). It is God’s statute not to imitate the practices of the nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the meaning of <i>and keep all his statutes</i> is: and you will not imitate the practices of the nations.</i>
[NONE OF THE DISEASES.] Its meaning is, the diseases you should remember. For you saw with your own eyes the diseases, the strokes, and the plagues which I put upon the Egyptians because they rebelled against Me. Now if you will hearken to My statutes you will be saved from these plagues, for I will not do to you what I did to them. Additionally, you have no need of a physician for I am the Lord that healeth thee from all disease which I have decreed to be upon the earth. I will heal you as I healed the bitter waters which no physician has the ability to heal. Behold, what happened at Marah was the opposite of what occurred when the first plague struck, for the waters of the Nile were sweet but the Egyptians could not drink from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">After the first plague struck.</i> However, here<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">At Marah.</i> the bitter waters turned sweet. You should therefore love the Lord and keep yourself from rebelling against Him, for He will do good for you.

Verse 27

AND THEY CAME TO ELIM. Saadiah Gaon says there were seventy species of palm trees there.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Seventy palm trees would not suffice for a such a large population.

Chapter 16



Verse 1

AND THEY TOOK THEIR JOURNEY. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that the reason Scripture mentions <i>the fifteenth day of the second month</i> is to inform us that Israel left Egypt on the fifth day of the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah’s reasoning is explained in what follows.</i> Now, the first day of Nisan fell on a Thursday<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If we assume that Israel left Egypt on a Thursday then the first day of Nisan had to fall on a Thursday, as Israel left Egypt on the 15th of Nisan.</i> and Iyyar on a Friday and on a Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Chodesh</i> (new moon) Iyyar fell on Friday and Saturday, as it does whenever the 15th of Nisan falls on a Thursday. Friday was the 30th of Nisan and Saturday the first day of Iyyar.</i> Israel came to the wilderness of Sin<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">On the 15th day of the second month (v. 1).</i> on a Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For the manna started to fall on a Sunday (see further in I.E.’s comment on this verse). Saadiah Gaon assumes that the manna began to fall on the day following Israel’s arrival in the wilderness of Sin. This is crucial for the establishment of Thursday as the day of the Exodus. For if the 15th of Iyyar fell on a Saturday, then the 15th of Nisan had to fall on a Thursday. Incidentally, this last happened in 1989.</i> and complained<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That they were starving (v. 3).</i> upon camping. Moses then told them that they would eat meat at even<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Of that day.</i> and that manna would come down in the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That is, on the following morning.</i> Now it is logical to assume that the manna first came down on a Sunday because Scripture states, <i>And it shall come to pass on the sixth day</i> (v. 5), the reference being to the sixth day of the week and the sixth day from the day on which the manna began to descend.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">When Scripture says, <i>and it shall come to pass on the sixth day</i> (v. 5) it means: and it shall come to pass on the sixth day from the day that the manna begins to fall. For after creation, with the exception of the Sabbath, Scripture does not refer to days of the week (Filwarg). It so happened that the sixth day fell on a Friday (see v. 23).</i> We will accept that which the Gaon says because of tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to Talmudic tradition the Israelites left Egypt on a Thursday. See <i>Sabbath</i> 87b.</i> not because of his explanation, for who told the Gaon that the manna came down on the morning following the coming of the Israelites to the wilderness of Sin?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Nowhere does Scripture say this.</i> The Israelites may have camped there for four or more days<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not state that the Israelites started to complain that they lacked food immediately upon arriving in Sin. The Israelites could have come to Sin on a day other than the Sabbath. They could have stayed there a few days and then started to complain on a Sabbath about a lack of food. There is thus no proof that the 15th of Iyyar fell on a Saturday. Hence there is no proof that the Exodus took place on a Thursday.</i> but the manna started to come down on Sunday. The latter is so because we start the count<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In order to get the number six mentioned in verses 5 and 22.</i> from the day that the manna began to fall,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if the sixth day from the start of the manna falling was a Friday (v. 22), the first day was a Sunday.</i> for all the nations rely on Israel with regard to this numeration.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">That the week ends on the Sabbath and the days are numbered from it. There can thus be no doubt that the manna started to fall on a Sunday.</i> Observe, the Christians named the days of the week after the stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Sunday, Monday, and the like.</i> However, they did not do the same with the Sabbath day. The first five days of the week in Arabic are numbered. The sixth day is called <i>al juma</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The day of gathering.</i> because it is the most honored day of the week for the Arabs and they congregate on this day. The Arabs refer to the day of <i>shabbat</i> as <i>sabbat</i> because the <i>shin</i> and <i>samekh</i> interchange in their script. They learned this<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">That the week ends with the Sabbath.</i> from the Israelites. Behold, the natives of India, who do not have the belief of six days of creation, begin the week on Wednesday because the sun is the star of that day and according to their beliefs it rules over them.

Verse 2

AND THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MURMURED. The Israelites murmured only against Moses at the waters of Marah (Ex. 15:23)<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to Sin, where they murmured against Moses and Aaron.</i> because it was he alone who led Israel onward.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">From the Red Sea to Marah. See Ex. 15:22.</i> Only a part of Israel and not the whole nation complained.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">At Marah.</i> Scripture therefore reads, <i>And the people</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">That is, some of the people murmured. However, here at Sin all the people murmured.</i> <i>murmured against Moses</i> (Ex. 15:24). However, in the wilderness of Sin we find that Scripture states, <i>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron</i> because both of them had brought them out of the land of Egypt. In Marah they complained because of the water. However, they now complained about a lack of bread and meat because they had already consumed most of their cattle, for thirty days had passed since they left Egypt. A congregation as large as Israel could only buy food at very great expense.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">From the surrounding nations. For demand drove the price up. Hence they complained against Moses and Aaron.</i>

Verse 3



Verse 4

BEHOLD, I WILL CAUSE TO RAIN BREAD FROM HEAVEN. The bread will come down like rain from the sky.
[BREAD.] The word <i>lechem</i> (bread) means food. It is found used for bread itself and also for meat, as in <i>lechem isheh</i> (food of the offering made by fire) (Lev. 3:11). It is also used for fruit, as in <i>Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof</i> (be-lachmo) (Jer. 11:19).
[THAT I MAY PROVE THEM.] For they will daily need Me. 

Verse 5

[TWICE.] The meaning of <i>mishneh</i> (twice) is two <i>omers</i> per person, for it is so written.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 22.</i>

Verse 6

AND MOSES AND AARON SAID. Moses and Aaron said, <i>then shall ye know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt</i> because the Israelites charged, <i>for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness</i> (v. 3). They answered, “Observe, we will perform two signs for you, one at the evening of this very day<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The coming of the quail.</i> and one on the morning of the morrow<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The appearance of the manna.</i> so that you will know that <i>the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt</i>.” Scripture should have read: at even and in the morning ye shall know<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>That the Lord hath brought you out of the land of Egypt.</i></i> because <i>and in the morning</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Which opens the next verse.</i> is not connected to <i>then ye shall see the glory of the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Which follows it, but rather to the previous verse. The meaning of our verse is: At even, then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt. Similarly in the morning.</i> For as Scripture goes on to say,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 10.</i> Israel saw God’s glory on that very day.

Verse 7

AND IN THE MORNING. I have already explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that <i>and in the morning</i> is not connected to what follows but rather to what comes before. See I.E.’s comments on the previous verse.</i>
FOR THAT HE HATH HEARD YOUR MURMURINGS. This is connected to <i>then ye shall see the glory of the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than to <i>and in the morning.</i> Our verse is to be understood as follows: Ye shall see the glory of the Lord for He hath heard your murmurings against the Lord.</i>
AND WHAT ARE WE. What can we do? We only did what we were commanded to do. The word <i>ve-nachnu</i> (and we) is missing an <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form is <i>va-anachnu.</i></i>

Verse 8

AND MOSES SAID. Moses now told them what the two signs<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Alluded to in verses 6 and 7.</i> would consist of.

Verse 9

Turn<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">It appears from the next verse that they did not actually go out into the wilderness, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> to the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Where Moses’ tent was located.</i>

Verse 10

AND IT CAME TO PASS. It became clear to them that when Aaron spoke to them, they came near before the Lord. The cloud came immediately and God’s glory was seen in it.

Verse 11

AND THE LORD SPOKE. The Israelites saw that Moses went to the glory of the Lord and spoke to God.

Verse 12

I HAVE HEARD. The word <i>telunnot</i> is irregular in that its <i>nun</i> has a <i>dagesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Telunnot</i> is vocalized with a <i>shuruk.</i> A <i>dagesh</i> is not usually placed in a letter which follows a <i>shuruk.</i></i> This prophecy<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">That God would give them flesh to eat in the evening and bread in the morning.</i> is repeated.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is stated for a second time in our verse.</i> Scripture had already noted,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 8.</i> <i>the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full.</i> It was only repeated<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">That God revealed Himself a second time to Moses.</i> so that Israel would see the glory of the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Speaking to Moses.</i>
[AT DUSK.] The term <i>ben ha-arbayim</i> means, as I have already explained, at dusk.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 12:6.</i> This verse proves my interpretation of <i>and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of God.</i> (v. 7).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">That these two clauses are not connected to each other. See I.E. on verses 6 and 7.</i> For the verse states, <i>At dusk ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than, and in the morning ye shall see the glory of God.</i>

Verse 13

AND IT CAME TO PASS AT EVEN. At the end of that very day.
THAT THE QUAILS CAME UP. Possibly from the direction of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Came up</i> indicates that they came from the sea. Compare, <i>Come ye up from the Jordan</i> (Josh. 4:17) (Filwarg).</i>
A LAYER OF DEW. <i>Shikhvat</i> (a layer) is similar to <i>yashkiv</i> (bring down) in <i>Or who can bring down</i> (yashkiv) <i>the bottles of heaven</i> (Job 38:37).<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.

Verse 14

AND WHEN THE LAYER OF DEW WAS GONE UP. The meaning of <i>va-ta’al</i> (was gone up)<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>ayin, lamed, heh</i> (to go up).</i> is ceased.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The usual meaning of <i>va-ta’al</i> is, went up, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is similar to <i>alah</i> (went up) in <i>Then defiledst thou it</i> — <i>my couch went up</i> (alah) (Gen. 49:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> The meaning of the latter verse is: from the time that you defiled my couch it was removed from me and ceased to function.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Gen. 49:4 should be translated: Then defildedst thou it — my couch was removed.

Verse 15

AND WHEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SAW IT. Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi. However, this comment is not found in Rashi but in Rashbam. I.E. most probably quoted from memory and erred. Krinsky cites an opinion that I.E. had an early edition of Rashi which had this interpretation and that Rashi later changed his mind and omitted it from subsequent editions.</i> says that the meaning of <i>man hu</i> (what is it) in Arabic is, <i>what is it</i>? However, someone misinformed him, because the Arabic phrase for “what is it” is <i>mah huwi,</i> as the term <i>man</i> is used in Arabic exclusively in reference to people. The way to explain <i>man</i> is to note that it comes from the same root as <i>minnah</i> (appointed) in <i>who hath appointed your food and your drink</i> (Dan. 1:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>man hu</i> means: it is something appointed (for us); it is a food allotment set aside for us.</i>
[AND MOSES SAID UNTO THEM.] Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that we know that the Torah is not written in chronological order. Thus the meaning of <i>And Moses said unto them</i> is: and Moses had previously said unto them.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">If Moses had not first said, <i>this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat,</i> Israel would not have known that the substance on the ground was their food allotment.</i> There are many similar instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Where the <i>vav</i> introduces a pluperfect. See I.E. on Gen. 1:9.</i> Indeed, we find that Scripture states in this very portion, <i>and it bred worms and rotted,</i> the meaning of which is: and it bred worms and had previously rotted.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. if it had not rotted first it would not have bred worms. The sequence of events thus was: it rotted and as a result bred worms.</i> Indeed, Scripture states, <i>and it did not rot, neither was there any worm in it</i> (v. 24).<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that rotting precedes the breeding of worms.</i> Scripture delayed reporting the words of Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>it is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat</i> is out of sequence. See note 87.</i> because it had to elaborate and go on to say, <i>This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded,</i> etc. (v. 16).<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Scripture wanted to present all the words that Moses spoke at that time in one unit.</i>

Verse 16

[GATHER YE OF IT EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS EATING.] This was to be done by logical estimate.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Every man according to his eating</i> implies that one is to estimate how much the person for whom one is gathering will eat. I.E. says that this part of the verse refers to minors.</i> <i>An omer for a head</i> was for someone fully grown, for minors gather according to how much they consume.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>every man according to his eating.</i></i>

Verse 17

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID SO. According to the plain meaning of the text some gathered more and some less according to the number of people in their tents. However, our sages said that our verse speaks of a miracle.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Some gathered more and some gathered less. Nevertheless, when they came home and measured what they had gathered they found that they had gathered an omer per person. <i>Yoma</i> 75a. Also Rashi.</i>

Verse 18

AND WHEN THEY DID METE IT WITH AN OMER. Each one found that he had the amount that he had estimated.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">When they gathered the manna they did not use a measure but collected by estimation. When they came home they measured the amount gathered and it came to an omer per head. In common with the other commentaries, such as Rashi and Rashbam, I.E. explains that verse 17 describes what Israel did in the field, and verse 18 what they found to be the case at home, hence his interpretation.</i>

Verse 19

AND MOSES SAID UNTO THEM: LET NO MAN LEAVE OF IT TILL THE MORNING. Its meaning is, do not leave some of the manna over to eat on the next morning. Rather, trust in the Lord that it will descend on the following day. There was no command to eat the entire omer.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Let no man leave of it till the morning</i> could conceivably be interpreted as a command to consume the entire omer, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> However, that which a person did not consume was to be thrown outside of his tent.

Verse 20

NOTWITHSTANDING THEY HEARKENED NOT UNTO MOSES. The word <i>anashim</i> (some of them) is connected to <i>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is to be interpreted as if written: Notwithstanding, some of them hearkened not unto Moses but left of it until morning.</i> They were few in number.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">That is, those who did not hearken unto Moses. Hence <i>ve-lo shame’u</i> (they hearkened not) does not refer to <i>alehem</i> (unto them) in the previous verse, which refers to all of Israel, but rather to <i>anashim</i> (some of them) which follows (Filwarg).</i> Rabbi Merinus<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">See notes on Ex. 1:10.</i> says that <i>va-yarum</i> (and it bred worms) comes from the same root as <i>rimmah</i> (worms).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>resh, mem, mem.</i> Hence <i>va-yarum</i> literally means: and it wormed; i.e., it bred worms.</i>

Verse 21

AND THEY GATHERED IT MORNING BY MORNING. The meaning of <i>ve-cham ha-shemesh</i> (and as the sun waxed hot) is: and when the day waxed hot. For the sun does not wax hot.
IT MELTED. <i>Namas</i> (melted) comes from a double root<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mem, samekh, samekh.</i></i> and is in the <i>nifal.</i>

Verse 22

AND IT CAME TO PASS. More than the usual amount of manna descended on this day, as Scripture goes on to note. Israel gathered twice as much food on this day because Moses had commanded them to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Not because they happened to find twice as much on the ground.</i> However, they did not know why.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Moses commanded them to gather twice as much manna on this day.</i> Also,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Aside from merely assuming that Israel gathered twice as much manna because Moses told them to, we have an indication from Scripture that this indeed was the case.</i> Scripture states, <i>they gathered,</i> not they found.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that they deliberately gathered twice as much. They would only do so at the command of Moses.</i> The rulers of the congregation came and told Moses that Israel did as he commanded them. They then asked Moses: What should be done with the extra portion? Why did he command them to gather twice as much food?<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">On this day.</i> How could they consume such a large amount of food?

Verse 23

AND HE SAID UNTO THEM. God has already told me that you are obligated to rest tomorrow and not do any work including the preparation of food,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Hence you are to gather a double portion of manna on the sixth day.</i> for tomorrow is a Sabbath day unto the Lord. This is God’s day<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, <i>today is a sabbath unto the Lord</i> (v. 25).</i> because He rested from all His work on the seventh day. We find the same with regard to the Sabbatical year, viz., <i>then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord</i> (Lev. 25:2).
[SABBATH.] The word <i>shabbat</i> is grammatically difficult. It does not belong in the paradigm of <i>gannav</i> (thief)<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">In which it appears to belong.</i> because the <i>tav</i> of <i>shabbat</i> is a feminine suffix,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas <i>gannav</i> is masculine.</i> as is proven by the phrase <i>shabbat hi la-Adonai</i> (it is a sabbath unto the Lord) (Lev. 23:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hi</i> (it; literally, she) is a feminine pronoun. Hence the word <i>shabbat</i> must be feminine.</i> The word <i>shabbat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>shin, bet, tav</i>.</i> is a noun meaning cessation.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">That is, cessation from work.</i> The following is its grammatical explanation. The word should have been spelled and vocalized <i>shabbetet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Vocalized <i>pattach, segol, segol.</i></i> according to the paradigm of <i>dalleket</i> (inflammation) (Deut. 28:22). When one of the <i>tavs</i><sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">The root <i>tav.</i></i> was dropped the <i>bet</i> was vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i><sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a <i>pattach.</i> I.E. refers to the <i>kamatz</i> as a <i>pattach</i> a number of times in his commentary on Exodus. See I.E. on Ex. 15:18.</i> to indicate that the word is feminine. It is the same, as I will explain, with the word <i>achat</i> (one).<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 26:8. Also <i>Sefer Ha-Tzachot</i> 4.</i>
[BAKE.] The word <i>efu</i> (bake) is irregular. It should have followed the paradigm of <i>asu</i> (do).<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">It should have been vocalized <i>afu,</i> as is the rule for words in the <i>kal</i> imperative which begin with a silent letter.</i> Behold, Moses told the rulers of the congregation<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse.</i> what they should do.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">With the extra portion of manna.</i>
BAKE THAT WHICH YE WILL BAKE. Bake as you normally do so that you will have what to eat on this day. <i>And see the that which ye will seethe</i> has a similar meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">That is, seethe as you normally seethe so that you will have what to eat on this day.</i> Behold, prepare and cook all this according to your heart’s desire from one omer and eat as much as you need.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">And leave over the second omer for the morning.</i>
AND ALL THAT REMAINETH. Lay it up till the morning and I will tell you what to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">With the second omer. I.E. held that the Israelites ate the second omer uncooked.</i> Now Moses did not inform them that no manna would descend on the Sabbath day. It was only in the morning that he revealed this secret to them

Verse 24



Verse 25

AND MOSES SAID. Many lacking in faith erred because of this verse and said that a person is obligated to keep the Sabbath day plus the night which follows it,<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Not the night before, as it is according to normative <i>halakha.</i> I.E. composed his <i>Sefer Ha-Shabbat</i> to refute this view. See Introduction to Vol. 1, p. XIX.</i> because Moses said, <i>for to-day</i> and not the night before <i>is a sabbath unto the Lord.</i> Additionally, Moses said, <i>Tomorrow is a solemn rest</i> (v. 23).<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">He did not say this evening.</i> They interpreted, in accordance with their view, <i>And there was evening and there was morning one day</i> (Gen. 1:5) to mean that the first day was not finished until the morning of the second day.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Began.</i> However, they spoke incorrectly. As I have already made mention to you, Moses spoke to Israel only in accordance with their practice. Now the manner of the land of the uncircumcised<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Europe, where I.E. wrote his commentary.</i> with regard to their food, their dress, their buildings, and affairs is not the same as that of the Land of Israel. It is the practice in the Land of Israel that no one bakes, cooks, or does any other work, both in summer or winter, at any time but during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas in Europe people work at night.</i> Hence Moses said, <i>Tomorrow is a solemn rest</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">He did not say, “This evening is a solemn rest,” because people in any case did not do any work in the evening. However, if the Torah had been written in Europe Moses would have said, “This evening is a solemn rest.”</i> Now pay close attention to understand the stupidity of those who explain <i>and there was evening and there was morning</i> in the manner which I noted above. For Scripture says, <i>And God called the light day</i> (Gen. 1:8), the reference being from the time that the sun rises until the time that it sets; <i>and to the darkness He called night,</i> the reference being from the time that the sun sets until the time that it rises. The night is thus the opposite of day, as the darkness is the opposite of the light. This being the case, how can Scripture refer to the evening, which commences at the time that the sun sets and lasts until the morning, as “day” when it is then night? Behold, concerning such people Scripture states, <i>They change the night into day</i> (Job 17:12). Now note that the word day is used in Hebrew in two ways. I have already mentioned one of them, viz., as long as the light of the sun is over any place on the earth. Therefore Scripture states, <i>three days, night and day</i> (Esth. 4:16) and, <i>and night and day</i> (Gen. 8:22). Now if the measure of the day includes the night in it, why mention night?<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">In Esth. 4:16 and Gen. 8:22.</i> It is also incorrect from the point of view of the science of linguistics<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Aside from the Biblical texts we have additional proof from linguistics that day cannot refer to nighttime.</i> for a noun to refer to two things which are the opposite of each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Hence day cannot refer to nighttime.</i> The word day is used secondarily in the sense of close or far-off time, as in <i>on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt</i> (Num. 3:13); <i>thou art to pass over the Jordan this day</i> (Deut. 9:1); <i>and cast them into another land, as it is this day</i> (Deut. 29:27); <i>And it shall come to pass in that day</i> (Is. 7:21). There are many other similar instances. Now let us leave all these things aside and seek, as I have said, only after the day of the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">That is, accept the fact that day begins at sunrise and ends at sunset.</i> for our years are not established according to the movement of the sun and moon but rather according to what the Bet Din decrees.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas each individual can establish when it is day by observing when the sun rises and sets.</i> Now we find that Scripture states, <i>Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread</i> (Ex. 12:15). Scripture then goes on to explain that this number<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Of days, i.e., the seven days when unleavened bread is to be eaten. This shows, contra the sectarians, that the evening is connected to the day that follows.</i> begins on the evening of the fourteenth of the first month (Ex. 12:18). Scripture also states, <i>from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath</i> (Lev. 23:32).<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">The Day of Atonement.</i> Furthermore, a man who has a seminal emission during the night or day, for it is so written, viz., <i>that which chanceth him by night</i> (Deut. 23:11), does not become “clean” until sunset, which is the end of the first day.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Following the emission or the day on which the emission occurred.</i> Now if it were so,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">As the sectarians maintain, that the night following the day is considered part of the previous day.</i> namely, that the first day ends on the morning of the next day,<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Following a seminal emission.</i> then it is only fit for the one who experienced an emission to immerse himself in the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Following an emission.</i> For if we say that the day and the night which follows it make up one day then the one who experienced an emission<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">During the day.</i> will be “unclean” for half a day<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">That is, till evening when he immerses himself.</i> and clean for half a day.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">From evening till the next morning.</i> And one who experienced an emission at the beginning of the night will be unclean for half of a day that passed<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">For the night belongs to the previous day.</i> and also for half of the coming day.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">For he immerses himself the following evening.</i> This is the opinion of those who err.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">As noted, however, it is illogical.</i> I have already explained to you the meaning of <i>and there was evening and there was morning</i> (Gen. 1:5) in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:5. There he explains <i>and there was evening and there was morning</i> not as meaning that the day came to a close at morning, but rather as meaning that the evening and the morning of the first day came.</i>
AND MOSES SAID. Moses now explained to them what they should do with the additional manna which was laid up, and he revealed to them its secret, that they would not find it this day because it did not come down.

Verse 26

SIX DAYS SHALL YE GATHER IT. It shall always be as it is now for as long as you are in the wilderness; that is, ye shall gather it for six days but on the seventh no manna shall come down.
[IN IT THERE SHALL BE NONE.] The word <i>bo</i> (in it) is added for additional clarification. It is similar to <i>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</i> (Gen. 2:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Of it</i> is inserted for clarification. See I.E. on Gen. 2:7.</i>

Verse 27

AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE SEVENTH DAY. Of the manna’s appearance.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">For the manna started to come down on a Sunday. See I.E.’s comments on verse 1.</i>
THAT THERE WENT OUT…TO GATHER. To see whether Moses’ words would stand up.

Verse 28

AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES. Moses was Israel’s representative.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that the words <i>How long refuse ye to keep My commandments,</i> etc., although spoken to Moses, were directed at Israel.</i> The meaning of our verse is: the Lord said unto Moses, tell the following to the Israelites.
[MY COMMANDMENTS.] This was said in reference to the people who left some of the manna over until the morning.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i>
[MY LAWS.]<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>torotai.</i></i> For God taught them the reason for the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. explains <i>torotai</i> to mean my teachings, that is, my teachings concerning the Sabbath, namely, that it is God’s day and manna would not fall on it.</i> They therefore gathered twice as much bread on the sixth day. There is a reason why Scripture employs the plural, namely, <i>My commandments and My laws</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">When in reality one command and one teaching were violated.</i> All the commandments and laws are, beyond any doubt, to be taken literally. However, they have secret meanings pertaining to the soul that only the enlightened can understand. Thus every commandment has two meanings.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Thus when one violates a commandment one disregards its obvious meaning plus its secret meaning, hence the use of the plural commandments and laws in our verse.</i>

Verse 29

SEE. Its meaning is: see the wonder that the Lord will perform for you so that it shall become clear to you that God commanded you to rest as He rested when He made all things in the beginning. God is therefore permitting twice as much manna to come down today as normally comes down every day.
ABIDE YE EVERY MAN IN HIS PLACE. In one’s tent.
[LET NO MAN GO OUT OF HIS PLACE.] It meaning is: let no man go out of his place on the seventh day to gather manna as the men who went out to gather did.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Contra the Karaites, who took this verse to mean that one is not permitted to leave one’s house on the Sabbath.</i> 

Verse 30

SO THE PEOPLE RESTED. Scripture tells us that from that day on, no man went out on the Sabbath to gather.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Manna.</i>

Verse 31

AND THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL CALLED THE NAME THEREOF MANNA. Behold, Scripture previously noted the miracles associated with the manna.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 16:15-30.</i> It now turns to relate its praises.
[AND IT WAS LIKE CORIANDER SEED, WHITE.] Some say that <i>gad</i> (coriander) refers to <i>kosbarta,</i> in Arabic, <i>kusbar.</i> Others say that it means mustard. However, I do not know, as it is not found in any other context save in reference to the manna. The same is the case with the word <i>tzappichat</i> (wafers), which Saadiah Gaon says means an unleavened wafer. Now when the manna was eaten as it was when it came down, it had the taste of a wafer made with honey. However, when cooked it had the taste of a cake baked in oil (Num. 11:8). Scripture mentions these two delicacies.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">However, when prepared in other ways it had other tastes.</i>

Verse 32

AND MOSES SAID. This chapter should have followed the account of the construction of the Tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse states, <i>and lay it</i> (the jar of manna) <i>up before the Lord.</i> This implies that the Tabernacle was in existence, as <i>before the Lord</i> means before the ark (v. 33). Hence the command to set aside a jar of manna was not given when the manna stated to fall but later, after the construction of the Tabernacle.</i> It was placed here to relate the miracle of the manna<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">That was placed in the jar.</i> lasting for generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture here mentions the miracle associated with the manna it relates this miracle as well.</i> Now Moses told this to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">In the name of God.</i> He therefore said, <i>wherewith I fed you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you. Prima facie,</i> our verse should read: that they may see the bread wherewith I fed them. Hence I.E. points out that when Moses spoke to Israel he used the second person. Thus our verse reads, I fed you.</i>

Verse 33

A JAR. A clay or copper utensil. The word is not found elsewhere.
[BEFORE THE LORD.] Its meaning is, before the divine glory which is upon the cherubim.

Verse 34

AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES. Scripture here explains that <i>before the Lord</i> means: <i>before the Testimony,</i> the reference being to the ark. The ark is referred to as the Ark of the Testimony because of the tablets of the covenant<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Also referred to as the tables of testimony. See Ex. 32:15.</i> that were in it.

Verse 35

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This miracle<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">That the manna accompanied Israel for forty years.</i> was greater than all the other miracles that were done via Moses, for many miracles were connected with the manna. These miracles, unlike all other wonders, lasted for forty years.
[UNTIL THEY CAME TO A LAND INHABITED.] Scripture says this for they were in the wilderness, <i>in a land that no man passed through</i> (Jer. 2:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> Now once Israel crossed the Jordan they ate the grain that they found there.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">See Josh. 5:11.</i> The reason Scripture found it necessary to say, <i>they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan</i> is that the manna accompanied them until they came to Gilgal,<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 5:10.</i> which lies on the border of the land of Canaan. The manna then ceased to fall, for now they had new grain.

Verse 36

NOW AN OMER IS THE TENTH PART OF AN EPHAH. Scripture mentions this measurement because one omer per person was sufficient for satiation.

Chapter 17



Verse 1

JOURNEYED. Scripture is being brief in saying <i>by their stages.</i> For <i>from the wilderness of Sin</i> Israel journeyed to Dophkah; from there to Alush, and from Alush they went to Rephidim.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 33:12-14. In other words, <i>by their stages</i> alludes to all the places that Israel stopped between Sin and Rephidim.</i>
[ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD.] Its meaning is, as I have already noted,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 15:22.</i> via the hand of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Moses alone, rather than the pillars of cloud and fire, now led the people.</i>

Verse 2

WHEREFORE THE PEOPLE STROVE. Scripture mentions <i>the people,</i> not <span class="underline">all</span> of the people as it does with regard to the manna,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 16:2.</i> for there were two parties. One had no water to drink. This is the group<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The people</i> mentioned in our verse.</i> that strove with Moses. The second group had water which they brought from Alush. This group,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The second group did not strive with Moses.</i> as Scripture goes on to say,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In the last part of our verse.</i> wanted to test God and see if He would provide water.
GIVE US WATER. They spoke to Moses and Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads, <i>tenu</i> (give). <i>Tenu</i> is in the plural, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> There was no need to mention Aaron,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse even though the people’s words were also directed at him. Aaron is not mentioned in our verse, hence I.E.’s comment.</i> for I have already explained that Moses spoke to Israel only through Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 4:30.</i> [WHY STRIVE YE WITH ME?] Moses answered them,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The first party.</i> <i>Why strive ye with me?</i> Let us all cry out unto the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This, according to I.E., is implied in <i>Why strive ye with me?</i></i> He said, <i>wherefore do ye try the Lord</i>? to those who wanted to test God.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The second party.</i>

Verse 3

AND THE PEOPLE THIRSTED. When the thirst overpowered them they raged against Moses and accused him of doing them evil in bringing them out of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>and the people murmured</i> follows <i>and the people thirsted.</i></i>

Verse 4

AND THE PEOPLE CRIED…THEY ARE ALMOST READY TO STONE ME. Scripture speaks metaphorically.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was not in actual danger of being stoned.</i> Its meaning is: they have striven with me and they rage against me. If they had the power they would stone me.

Verse 5

AND THE LORD SAID. Some say that because Moses said, <i>they are almost ready to stone me,</i> God told him, <i>Pass on before the people</i> who strive with you and inform them that you will now give them water.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In this interpretation, <i>pass on before the people</i> is short for: pass on before the people who strive with you, etc.</i>
AND TAKE WITH THEE OF THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL; AND THY ROD, WHEREWITH THOU SMOTEST THE RIVER. By command.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Moses did not personally smite the river. He told Aaron to do so. See Ex. 7:19 and I.E. on Ex. 17:25.</i>

Verse 6

BEHOLD, I WILL STAND BEFORE THEE THERE UPON THE ROCK IN HOREB. Its meaning is, you will find Me there, the idea being you will encounter My strength and power on Horeb.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is not to be taken literally. It should be understood as: you will find My strength and power upon the rock in Horeb.</i>
AND THOU SHALT STRIKE THE ROCK. Which contains no water.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">At present.</i>
[AND MOSES DID SO.] Scripture is being brief, for it does not mention, <i>and the congregation drank, and their cattle</i> (Num. 20:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As it does in recording a similar account in the wilderness of Sin.</i>

Verse 7

CALLED. Moses or someone.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse literally reads, <i>And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah.</i> The subject is omitted, hence I.E.’s comment.</i>
MASSAH AND MERIBAH. Because of the two reasons noted.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse Massah means trying and Meribah strife.</i> It is the style of the Hebrew language to begin its comments with the second of two items when two particulars are listed,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture first mentions Massah and then Meribah. It then goes on to first explain Meribah and then Massah.</i> as the second item is at hand. Compare, <i>And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau</i> (Josh. 24:4), which is followed by <i>and I gave unto Esau</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.). Scripture similarly first mentions Massah and then Meribah and turns to explain that the name of the place was called Meribah <i>because of the striving of the children of Israel</i> with Moses. It then explains that the place was called Massah <i>because they tried the Lord.</i> Now “trial” refers to Israel’s asking, <i>Is the Lord among us</i> to provide for all of our needs? This second party angered God more than the first.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">For the first complained because they were overpowered by thirst.</i> Scripture therefore says, <i>Ye shall not try the Lord your God, as ye tried Him in Massah</i> (Deut. 6:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The first party is not mentioned at all in this verse.</i>

Verse 8

THEN CAME AMALEK. The reference is to the nation of Amalek, which <i>dwelleth in the land of the South</i> (Num. 13:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">And not to any other nation or person by that name. See I.E.’s comment on verse 20.</i>

Verse 9

AND MOSES SAID UNTO JOSHUA. Joshua was the grandson<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>nin,</i> as in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 and in some of the printed editions. Some editions have <i>nun.</i> The latter is probably a scribal error. However, Filwarg believes it to be correct and tries to justify it. It is also possible that I.E. was playing on the words <i>nin</i> and <i>nun,</i> the former meaning grandson and the latter being the name of Joshua’s father.</i> of Prince Elishama ben Ammihud, the possessor of the banner of the tribe of Ephraim.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Num. 1:10; 2:18; I Chron. 7:26, 27.</i> Scripture refers to him here as Joshua,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">His birth name was <i>Hoshe’a.</i> See Num. 13:16.</i> which is the name by which Moses called him in the account of the spies.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 13:16.</i>
CHOOSE US OUT. It is Hebrew style to speak in this manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">To employ the possessive pronoun, <i>lakh</i> (for thee) or <i>lanu</i> (for us) for purposes of emphasis.</i> Compare, <i>choose thee</i> (II Sam. 24:12); <i>Tarry ye here for us</i> (Ex. 24:14).
MEN. Renowned, powerful men and men of war, as in <i>all of them men</i> (Num. 13:3).
AND GO OUT, FIGHT WITH AMALEK. Go out from the camp of Israel to fight against Amalek.
I WILL STAND ON TOP OF THE HILL. Horeb, which is the same as Mount Sinai.
WITH THE ROD OF GOD IN MY HAND. With which I will lift my hand to pray.

Verse 10

SO JOSHUA DID. Aaron and Hur are mentioned because of the need to explain (they) <i>stayed up his hands</i> (v. 12).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture goes on to note that Aaron and Hur held up Moses’ hands it first had to tell us that they went up the hill with Moses.</i>

Verse 11

AND IT CAME TO PASS. Some say that Moses held his hand<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Which grasped the rod of the Lord.</i> up in a manner similar to one holding up a banner in war.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashbam.</i> However, if this was the case then Aaron or Hur would have lifted the rod up or they would have placed it on a high place on the mountain so that the people would see it standing. The correct interpretation is the one offered by the ancient sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Moses’ raised hands served to direct the heart of Israel towards heaven. Cf. <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 3:8: “Now do the hands of Moses promote or hinder the battle! It is rather to teach you that when the Israelites directed their thoughts on high and subjected their hearts to their Father in heaven, they prevailed; and if not they were defeated.”</i>

Verse 12

BUT MOSES’ HANDS WERE HEAVY. We know that a human being does not have the strength to hold his hands up for an entire day. One cannot even hold them up for a few hours, certainly not until <i>the going down of the sun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore what purpose does Scripture have in telling us <i>but Moses’ hands were heavy</i>?</i> Now Scripture notes that Moses’ hands were heavier than the hands of other old people.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra does not indicate why Moses’ hands were heavier than those of other people his age.</i> Moses thus could not continually hold his hands up.
[AND PUT IT.] Its meaning is, they strengthened his place<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">By placing a stone beneath him (Krinsky).</i> because he was not able to stand up.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Not only were Moses’ hands tired but Moses himself was unable to stand.</i>
AND AARON AND HUR. Stood.

Moses told Hobab, [<i>Leave us not, I pray thee</i>] <i>forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness</i> (Num. 10:31). Now we know that Israel camped around Sinai for about a year. Lo and behold, Moses’ very words prove this to be so. For Moses is quoted in the Torah portion, <i>These are the words</i> as saying, <i>The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: …turn you, and take your journey</i> (Deut. 1:6,7).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">From Sinai.</i> Now this was said close to their time of journey.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>And we journeyed from Horeb</i> (Deut. 1:19) follows immediately.</i> Moses continued, <i>And I spoke unto you at that time saying: I am not able to bear you myself alone</i> (Deut. 1:9); for <i>the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude</i> (Deut. 1:10). The reason Moses mentioned this to them was that God told Jacob, <i>Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession</i> (Gen. 48:4). Now the meaning of the latter is: when your seed increase I will give them the land. Moses therefore said, <i>the Lord your God hath multiplied you</i> and the time for you to inherit the land has come. However, since you are so numerous I was not able to carry you alone,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 1:9,12.</i> and I had to place over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 1:15</i> Now this<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Placing captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over the people to assist Moses in judging them.</i> was the advice given to Moses by Jethro on the morrow following his coming to the wilderness of Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 18:13.</i> Moses therefore said to Hobab, who, as we explained, is to be identified with Jethro, <i>We are journeying</i> (Num. 10:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Unto the place of which the Lord said: I will give it to you; come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.</i></i> Hobab responded, <i>I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred</i> (Num. 10:30). This is what <i>And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land</i> (v. 27) refers to. I will now explain why the chapter dealing with Jethro was inserted here. It was placed here because Scripture had just mentioned the evil that Amalek did to Israel. The Torah wants to contrast it with the good that Jethro rendered Israel. Scripture notes, <i>And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel</i> (v. 9) and that he gave proper and correct counsel to Moses and Israel. Moses told Jethro, <i>and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes</i> (Num. 10:31), meaning that he enlightened their eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes <i>ve-hayita</i> (and thou shalt be) as a perfect. He renders Num. 10:31 as: and you were to us instead of eyes; i.e., you enlightened us with your council. See I.E. on Num. 10:31 where he quotes this interpretation and prefaces it with the phrase, “many say.”</i> King Saul similarly said,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">To Jethro’s descendants.</i> <i>for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel</i> (I Sam. 15:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the good advice which Jethro gave to Israel. King Saul said <i>ye</i> because the good that Jethro had done accrued to the benefit of his descendants. See Kimchi on I Sam. 15:6.</i> Now because Scripture states in the preceding chapter, <i>the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation</i> (Ex. 17:16), namely, that when God gives Israel rest they are obligated to wage war against Amalek, the Torah mentions the account of Jethro. For the descendants of Jethro lived in proximity to the nation of Amalek,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See I Sam. 15:6. Literally, For they were with the nation of Amalek. <i>Vat, Ebr.</i> 38 reads: should they ever be found together with Amalek. It reads, <i>k i im</i> rather than <i>ki hem.</i></i> and the Torah wants Israel to remember the kindness that Jethro demonstrated so that they do not harm his seed. Thus we find the Rechabites, who were descended from Jethro, living among the children of Israel in Jerusalem. We find Jonadab the son of Rechab<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Actually the descendants of Jonadab the son of Rechab.

We thus see that the Hebrews did not follow strict grammatical rules when coining proper nouns.</i> For look, <i>kayin</i> (Cain) was so called because Eve said, <i>kaniti</i> (I have gotten) (Gen. 4:1). However, this is grammatically incorrect.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kaniti</i> comes from the root <i>kof, nun, heh.

See note 96. Filwarg suggests two possible emendations: one, <i>va-yishtacheh,</i> the other, <i>va-yishtachev.</i> In the former, I.E. is explaining that if a <i>vav</i> had not been substituted for a <i>heh,</i> the word would have been <i>va-yishtacheh.</i> For the latter is the way third person <i>hitpa’el</i>’s are vocalized. If we emend to <i>va-yishtachev,</i> then I.E. is merely explaining why the word is vocalized <i>va-yishtachu</i> when, as noted above, according to Hebrew grammar the word should have been vocalized <i>va-yishtachev.</i> The error in transcription probably arose from the fact that the normally used word for “and he bowed” is <i>va-yishtachaveh.</i> See Filwarg and Krinsky.</i> should have been employed in the singular,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the third person singular perfect.</i> rather than <i>va-yishtachu,</i> for the <i>tav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>va-yishtachu.</i></i> is a sign of the <i>hitpa’el</i> conjugation.

Thus the word <i>va-yishtachu,</i> ending in a silent <i>vav,</i> would appear to be in the plural. <i>Va-yishtachu</i> was therefore penultimately accented<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than ultimately accented as is the usual case with words in the third person perfect.</i> to differentiate between it and the customary way of vocalizing plurals.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Which is to accent them ultimately.

Verse 9

AND JETHRO REJOICED. <i>Va-yichad</i> (rejoiced) comes from the same root as the word <i>chedvah</i> (rejoicing).<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>chet, dalet, heh</i> The meaning of <i>va-yichad</i> thus is, and he rejoiced.</i> It should have been vocalized like the word <i>va-yift</i> (enticed) in <i>And my heart hath been secretly enticed</i> (Job 31:27) and <i>va-yishb</i> (and took captive) in <i>and took some of them captive</i> (Num. 21:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>va-yift</i> is <i>peh, tav, heh,</i> and that of <i>va-yishb</i> is <i>shin, bet, heh.

The latter is referred to as an abbreviated root. Now since the root of <i>va-yichad</i> is <i>chet, dalet heh, va-yichad</i> should have been vocalized <i>va-yichd.</i></i> However, the <i>chet</i> was vocalized with a <i>pattach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than a <i>sheva.</i></i> because it is a guttural, and the <i>dagesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Which is placed in the <i>dalet</i> in the long form, viz., <i>yechedeh.</i></i> remains in the <i>dalet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">In the short form. <i>Va-yichad</i> has a <i>dagesh</i> in it. <i>Prima facie,</i> there is no reason for this <i>dagesh.</i> Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> as it was.

Verse 10

AND JETHRO SAID: BLESSED BE THE LORD. Give your attention to the grammatical explanation of the word <i>barukh</i> (blessed). Note that the <i>pa’ul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">The passive <i>kal</i> participle form.</i> can only be formed from transitive verbs. If you find a verb following the <i>pa’ul</i> form, look around; if you find it has a transitive <i>po’el</i><sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Po’el</i> is the active <i>kal</i> participle form.</i> form, then the word is a real <i>pa’ul.</i> However, if you do not find it to be so,<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">If the word does not have an active form.</i> then the word<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>pa’ul.</i></i> is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. all intransitive verbs in the participle form, whether active or passive, are adjectives, for they describe a state.</i> Similarly, if a word is in the <i>po’el</i> form and its root does not come in the <i>pa’ul</i> in the same conjugation, then the word is also not a <i>po’el</i> but an adjective. For example, the <i>po’el</i> and <i>pa’ul</i> forms of <i>shamar</i> (kept) are <i>shomer</i> (keeps) and <i>shamur</i> (kept).<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>shomer</i> and <i>shamur</i> are true <i>po’el</i> and <i>pa’ul</i> forms.</i> Compare, <i>shamur</i> in <i>riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt</i> (Eccles. 5:12). Now we encounter <i>holekh</i> (goes), <i>omed</i> (stands), <i>yotze</i> (goes out). All these words appear to be verbs in the <i>po’el,</i> for they follow the form of <i>shomer.</i> However, since these roots form intransitive verbs, for one cannot say <i>halukh</i> (wented), <i>amud</i> (stooded up), <i>yatzu</i> (wented out), these words do not come in the <i>pa’ul.</i> Therefore when Scripture uses the term <i>holekh</i> (went) in <i>because he went</i> (Num. 22:21), it employs an adjective, not a verb. We find [Scripture using] the word <i>atzum</i> (mighty). The word appears to be a <i>pa’ul</i> because it follows the paradigm of <i>shamur</i> (kept). However, when we investigated this root we found the word <i>va-ya’atzmu</i> (waxed mighty), in <i>and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty</i> (Ex. 1:7), to be among the intransitive verbs. For its transitive form comes in the <i>hifil</i><sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas <i>va-ya’atzmu</i> is in the <i>kal.</i></i> as in <i>va-ya’atzimehu</i> (and made them too mighty) in <i>and made them too mighty for their adversaries</i> (Ps. 105:24). Now we cannot say that <i>otzem</i> (strengthens) following the paradigm of <i>shomer</i> (keeps) means strength,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the word <i>atzam</i> in the <i>kal</i> means waxed mighty, its <i>po’el</i> form does not mean waxes mighty but closes. In other words, the word <i>atzam</i> meaning strength has no <i>po’el</i> form.</i> for in this case it has a different meaning, as in <i>otzem</i> (shutteth) in <i>And shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil</i> (Is. 33:15). Now we find the word <i>barukh,</i> which follows the paradigm of <i>shamur</i> (kept). We searched all of Scripture and we did not see this root<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bet, resh, kaf.</i></i> used with this meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">That is, meaning blessing.</i> in all of the <i>kal</i> conjugation.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that the root <i>bet, resh, kaf</i> in the <i>kal</i> means to kneel. It is only used with regard to a blessing in the <i>pa’ul</i> form.</i> We found it used<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>kal.</i></i> only with another meaning, namely, to kneel, as in <i>va-yivrakh</i> (kneeled) in <i>and kneeled down upon his knees</i> (I Chron. 6:13), which<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Like the above-noted words.</i> is also intransitive and does not have a <i>pa’ul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">There is no <i>kal pa’ul</i> form for kneeled because <i>barukh</i> means blessed.</i> form. The word <i>barukh</i> (blessed) is thus like the word <i>atzum</i> (might), a <i>kal</i> adjective. Rabbi Merinus<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Jonah ibn Janach.</i> says that <i>barukh</i> (blessed) is an adjective in the <i>pi’el.</i> Its <i>resh</i> should have received a <i>dagesh</i> like all other such roots,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Words in the <i>pi’el</i> receive a <i>dagesh</i> in their middle stem letters.

However, Rabbi Merinus spoke incorrectly, for all adjectives such as <i>shakkul</i> (bereaved), <i>gibbor</i> (warrior), <i>shikkor</i> (drunk)<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">That is, all <i>pi’el</i> adjectives.</i> do not undergo any change by having the vowel that precedes the <i>dagesh</i> change in the singular construct or in the plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the vowel beneath the first letter of a word in the <i>pi’el</i> does not change in the singular construct or in the plural.

The point is, the <i>chirik</i> preceding the <i>bet</i> with the <i>dagesh</i> in it does not change in <i>gibbor,</i> which is in the construct. Neither does it change in <i>gibborim,</i> which is the plural of <i>gibbor.</i> However, it does change in the <i>kal;</i> viz., <i>davar</i> becomes <i>devar i</i>n the construct and <i>devarim</i> in the plural.</i> (mighty) in <i>Woe unto them that are mighty</i> (Is. 5:22). Now the word <i>berukh</i> (blessed of),<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">The construct of <i>barukh.</i></i> in <i>Come in, thou blessed of the Lord</i> (Gen. 24:31) and <i>berukhim</i> (blessed) in, <i>Blessed be ye of the Lord</i> (Ps. 115:15), argue against Rabbi Merinus.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">The singular of which is <i>barukh.</i> We thus see that in the case of these two words the <i>kamatz</i> changes to a <i>sheva.</i> However, as noted above, this does not occur in the <i>pi’el</i> form.

[YEA, FOR THAT.] Because of the fact that the Egyptians dealt willfully with Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ki va-davar</i> (yea, for that) means: because of the fact, viz., the <i>bet</i> prefixed to <i>davar</i> means because. The <i>bet</i> usually means in. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Jethro similarly, noted above, <i>I know that the Lord is greater than all gods</i> in that he punished the Egyptians because they made Israel work with rigor. It is similarly written, <i>Thou knewest that they dealt proudly</i> (hezidu) <i>against them</i> (Neh. 9:11) that is, they<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">The Egyptians.</i> behaved like a person who does whatever he wants to.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the words <i>hezidu</i> and <i>zadu</i> mean dealt willfully.</i> Scripture already stated, <i>for I know their pains; and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians</i><sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The hand of the Egyptians</i> indicates that the Egyptians did what they wanted with Israel.</i> (Ex. 3:7,8).

Verse 12

AND JETHRO, MOSES’ FATHER-IN-LAW, TOOK A BURNT-OFFERING AND SACRIFICES. The latter refers to peace-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> (sacrifices) usually refers to peaceofferings (Weiser).</i>
[FOR GOD.] The meaning of <i>for God</i> is that henceforth the revered Lord shall be his God.
AND AARON CAME, AND ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL. There is no need to mention Moses, as they were in Moses’ tent.
TO EAT BREAD. Peaceofferings.
[BEFORE GOD.] Scripture reads thus because Moses’ tent was on the east side of the tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">The tabernacle faced east. Hence Moses’ tent was in front of God’s tabernacle. It will be recalled that according to I.E., Jethro arrived in the second year following the Exodus, after the erection of the tabernacle.</i>

Verse 13

AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE MORROW. Of Jethro’s coming.
THAT MOSES SAT. As was his custom.
FROM THE MORNING UNTO THE EVENING. Note that true morning<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>boker.</i></i> begins with sunrise. The term morning is, as I have previously noted,<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 12:31.</i> also applied to the breaking of dawn, when light begins to be seen in the clouds. In the latter instance the term is artificially used. Similarly, true evening begins when the sun sets. The term is also artificially applied up to the time that the light sets.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">That is, from sunset till the disappearance of the light.</i> David similarly said, <i>The sun ariseth, they</i><sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">The nocturnal creatures. We thus see that morning begins at sunrise.</i> <i>slink away</i> (Ps. 104:22). Scripture then states, <i>Man goeth forth unto his work, And to his labor until the evening</i> (Ps. 104:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Erev.</i> The psalm seems to describes man’s working hours from sunrise to sunset, for <i>erev</i> is antithetical to sunrise. We thus see that evening begins at sunset.</i> It is therefore fitting to interpret <i>from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath</i> (Lev. 23:32) to mean: from the true evening to the true evening.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">That is, from sunset to sunset.</i> However, our sages of blessed memory “added from the weekday to the holy day”<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the sages extended the holy day.</i> and said that the Sabbath does not end until the stars come out.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sabbath</i> 34b.</i> It is thus fitting from the Torah’s point of view to start the Sabbath at sunset. All scientists and astronomers admit that the day’s boundary is<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">That is, day begins.</i> the moment when the circle of the sun faces all over the area of the earth. This starts at sunrise and ends at sunset.

Verse 14

AND…SAW ALL THAT HE DID TO THE PEOPLE. That he caused them to stand from morning to evening. 
Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi.</i> says that Jethro reacted in this manner because Moses alone sat and Israel stood, the latter being improper.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi, “[Moses] sat like a king and all of the people stood. Jethro was troubled by this. For Moses did not show respect for Israel. He chastised Moses for this and said, <i>What is this thing that thou doest to the people?</i>”</i> There can be no doubt that Moses’ station was too great for Jethro to say this.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">To rebuke Moses for sitting in judgment while the litigants stood.</i> For behold, Aaron, who was a great man in the eyes of Israel and was older than Moses, said to Moses, <i>Oh my lord</i> (Num. 12:11). Moses acted in the proper manner, for the judge sits and the litigants stand. We thus read, <i>then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand</i> (Deut. 19:17). Jethro said, <i>why</i><sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sittest thou alone,</i> etc.</i> to Moses for no reason other than that Moses was sitting alone and had no other judges to assist him. [WHY.] Rabbi Merinus says that the word <i>maddu’a</i> (why) is similar to <i>mallakhem</i> (what mean ye) (Is. 3:15) and to <i>mazzeh</i> (what is that) in <i>what is that in thy hand</i> (Ex. 4:2), each of which is a compound of two words.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mazzeh</i> being a compound of <i>mah</i> (what) and <i>zeh</i> (this) and <i>mallakhem</i> being a compound of <i>mah</i> (what) and <i>lakhem</i> (to you).</i> The same is true of <i>maddu’a,</i> which means: what is in your mind that you do this?<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>maddu’a</i> is a compound of <i>ma</i> (what) and <i>du’a</i> (opinion), i.e., what is your opinion? <i>Du’a</i> is spelled <i>dalet, vav, ayin,</i> and is a variation of the root <i>yod, dalet, ayin,</i> meaning knowledge.</i>

Verse 15

AND MOSES SAID. Moses answered, I do two things. One, <i>Because the people come unto me to inquire of God,</i> that is, to inquire of God’s law.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>to inquire of God</i> is short for, to inquire of God’s law.</i> The other, <i>when they have a matter, it cometh unto me</i> (v. 16). Moses explained the second task first, namely, <i>and I judge between a man and his neighbor</i> (<i>ibid</i>.); and, he then said,<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Explaining verse 16.</i> to one who inquires, <i>I make them know the statutes of God.</i>

Verse 16



Verse 17

AND…SAID…THE THING THAT THOU DOEST IS NOT GOOD. In my eyes. Jethro then explained himself, <i>Thou wilt surely wear away. Navol tibbol</i> (thou shalt surely wear away) comes from the same root as <i>yibbol</i> (wither)<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">The root, of which is <i>nun, bet, lamed</i>. <i>Navol</i> is an infinitive and <i>tibbol</i> an imperfect. The literal translation of <i>navol tibbol</i> is: wither you will wither; that is, you will collapse.</i> in <i>And whose leaf doth not wither</i> (Ps. 1:3) and <i>novelet</i> (fadeth)<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Or withers.</i> in <i>For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth</i> (Is. 1:30). Its meaning is, you shall, as it were, drop like a withered leaf. The word <i>gam</i> (both)<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, also. Verse 18 reads: also thou, also this people.</i> is to be prefaced also to <i>for the thing is too heavy for thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>for the thing is too heavy for thee</i> is not a reason for what precedes it but an additional reason why Moses should not judge the people all by himself. For an alternate interpretation see Filwarg.</i>

Verse 18

TO PERFORM IT. <i>Asohu</i> (to perform it) is grammatically inconsistent.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>asohu</i> is <i>ayin, sin, heh.</i> When roots that end in a <i>heh</i> are combined with a pronoun, the <i>heh</i> changes to a <i>tav.</i> Hence our word should read <i>asoto</i> rather than <i>asohu.</i></i> It follows the form of <i>lishmerehu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Which, unlike the root of <i>asohu,</i> is a “whole,” i.e., a root that does not drop a letter.</i> (to preserve him),<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yishmerehu</i> (preserve him) in Ps. 41:3.</i> for we do not find the <i>heh</i> to be visible in the root <i>ayin, sin, heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i> in this root is dropped when conjugated. Compare, <i>asiti, asita,</i> etc. Thus there is no reason why the root should follow the paradigm of a “whole” root when combined with a pronoun. Hence the grammatical inconsistency of <i>asohu.</i></i>

Verse 19

HEARKEN NOW UNTO MY VOICE, I WILL GIVE THEE COUNCIL. <i>I’atzekha,</i> means I will give you council.
[GOD.] Note that the term <i>Elohim</i> (God) is, as I have noted, an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 3:4,15.</i> It is only because the word is used often that this adjective is considered as if it were a proper noun. Examples of the latter are: <i>Elohim</i> (God) in <i>God will let me gaze upon my adversaries</i> (Ps. 59:11); <i>In the beginning God</i> (Elohim)<i>created the heaven and the earth</i> (Gen. 1:1), and many other instances. It is for this reason that our sages of blessed memory placed <i>Elohim</i> among the names that are not erasable.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">One is forbidden to erase any of God’s name. <i>Elohim</i> is included among the latter. See chapter 4 of <i>Tractate Soferim.</i></i>
[AND GOD BE WITH THEE.] Its meaning is, God will help you if you act in this manner. At the close of his words, Jethro told Moses to ask permission of God to act in accordance with Jethro’s counsel. This is what Jethro meant by <i>and God command thee so</i> (v. 23). There is no doubt that Moses did so.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Even though this is not stated in the text.</i>
[BE THOU FOR THE PEOPLE.] The meaning of <i>la-am</i><sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to the people. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> is, for the people.
BEFORE GOD. From God’s side.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>mi-pe’at Elohim.</i> The Biblical text reads, <i>mul ha-Elohim;</i> literally, before of God. I.E. apparently interprets it as: you will face the people from the same side as God faces them: that is, you will serve as God’s messenger to the people (Weiser). It is interesting to note that <i>Peshita</i> interprets similarly. It reads, “teaching the people from God.” However, the <i>mem</i> in I.E. often has the meaning of a <i>lamed.</i> Thus <i>mi-pe’at Elohim</i> might be interpreted as <i>li-fe’at Elohim;</i> that is, you will be the intermediary between the people and God (Krinsky). See Rashi. In this case, <i>mul ha-Elohim</i> means before God.</i>
AND BRING THOU THE CAUSES UNTO GOD. If they be difficult. These are the things that Moses mentioned at first,<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">In response to Jethro’s question, why do you sit and the people stand around you from morning till evening (v. 14). Also see I.E. on verse 15.</i> viz., <i>when they have a matter, it cometh unto me</i> (v. 16). Jethro then explained this<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">That the people should bring before Moses only the difficult causes.</i> to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 22.</i> viz., the hard causes they shall bring unto thee.

Verse 20

AND THOU SHALT TEACH THEM. As to the second thing you spoke of,<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">That you are busy instructing the people.</i> you are obligated to teach and instruct them only those things that they are uncertain of. For it takes great effort to teach all, <i>the work that they must do.</i> Now as to the meaning of <i>ve-hizharta</i> (and thou shalt teach): <i>ve-hizharta</i> comes from the same root as <i>nizhar</i> in <i>and took not warning</i> (Ezek. 33:5). <i>Nizhar</i> means took warning.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>ve-hizharta</i> (and thou shalt teach) means: and thou shalt warn.</i>
THEM. <i>Ethem</i> (them) is a compound of two words.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">It is made up of <i>et</i> and <i>hem.</i></i>
[AND THOU SHALT TEACH THEM.] You shall warn them<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">See note 205.</i> to observe the positive and negative commandments that are tied to the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">That one observe with one’s heart. Bachya ibn Pekuda (c. 1050-1120) referred to them as <i>chovat ha-levavot</i> (duties of the heart) and wrote a work by that name.</i> such as, to love God,<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 10:12; 11:13; 22:19; 30:6,16,20.</i> to cleave unto God,<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 11:22; 30:20.</i> to fear God,<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 4:10; 5:26; 6:24; 10:12; 14:23; 17:19; 31:13.</i> to walk after God,<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 26:17; 28:9.

Moses similarly said, [<i>But the word is very nigh unto thee</i>] <i>in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it</i> (Deut. 30:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Which according to I.E. means that the commandments observed with the heart are the most important commandments. See I.E. on Deut. 30:14.</i> There many such precepts.
THEY MUST WALK. <i>Yelekhu bah</i> means wherein they must walk.
AND THE WORK THAT THEY MUST DO. The reference is to positive precepts which are observed by action. Most of them are not positive commandments that stand by themselves<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that the act itself is of inherent worth, such as belief in God, <i>tzedaka,</i> acts of loving kindness.</i> but serve as a reminder, such as the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Which bears testimony that God created heaven and earth.

A different reading of Scripture was that of Hermann Cohen, who wrote, “[The] law of shielding the alien from all wrong is of vital significance in the history of religion. With it alone, true religion begins. The alien was to be protected, not because he was a member of one’s family, clan, religious community, or people; but because he was a human being. In the alien, therefore, man discovered the idea of humanity.” <i>The Pentateuch and the Haftorahs,</i> ed. by J.H.

See I.E. on Lev. 19:19.</i> and many others.<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">There are many other commandments which serve as reminders of theological truths and historical events.</i> I will explain them in their place.

Verse 21

MOREOVER THOU SHALT PROVIDE. I have already informed you that the speakers of Hebrew do not preserve exact wording. They only preserve meanings.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 11:5 and Gen. 5:29.</i> Hence, as I will yet explain, we will not pay attention to whether the text is full or deficient.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">That is, whether two texts that relate the same event match each other exactly. I.E. makes this point here because, as he goes on to note, there are discrepancies between our chapter and the first chapter of Deuteronomy with regard to the description of the quality of the judges chosen by Moses.</i> Now when Moses recounted this incident,<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">The appointment of judges.</i> in place of <i>able men</i><sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>anshe chayil.</i> Literally, valiant men, mighty men.</i> he said, <i>Get you…men</i> (Deut. 1:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>get you able men,</i> as in our verse.</i> Men in the latter verse has the same meaning as men in <i>Choose us out men</i> (Ex. 17:9) and in <i>all of them men</i> (Num. 13:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of men in both of these verses is, men of valor, for both verses deal with tasks requiring such men. Thus <i>anashim</i> in Deut. 1:13 means the same as <i>anshe chayil</i> in Ex. 18:21 even though the wording is different.</i> Jethro said appoint men.
SUCH AS FEAR GOD. Who do not fear men but fear only God. It was to them that Moses was referring when he said,<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">To Israel.</i> <i>wise…and understanding</i> (Deut. 1:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">That is, bring forth wise and understanding men and I will appoint them as judges.</i> For it is not possible for one to be a fearer of heaven unless one be wise. 
Jethro continued: MEN OF TRUTH. Who do not lie. HATING UNJUST GAIN (<i>betza</i>). Money.<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>betza</i> (unjust gain) means money. So too Rashi.</i> People who appear so, and are known as such by the community. It was in reference to these that Moses said, <i>and known</i> (Deut. 1:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i>
RULERS OF THOUSANDS. One may wonder: If the meaning of the term rulers is here to be taken literally, then their number comes to more that seventy-nine thousand.<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites numbered <i>six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men</i> (Ex. 38:26). The number of rulers over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens of such a group comes to 79,650 (Krinsky).</i> Now, it is extremely far-fetched for there to have been so many rulers. Indeed, Scripture states, <i>For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof</i> (Prov. 28:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. A surfeit of rulers is a punishment for a people. Why then would Moses appoint so many rulers over Israel?</i> Furthermore, how is it possible for an eighth of the camp to be heads of the tribes? For this is what Moses said, that is, <i>So I took the heads of your tribes</i><sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues: <i>And made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens.</i></i> (Deut. 1:15). Additionally, how is it possible that all of the above-mentioned virtues<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Able men, God-fearing men, truthful men, etc.</i> were found in these people who came out of Egypt and learned their ways? Indeed, Scripture states, <i>After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do</i> (Lev. 18:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies that Israelites followed Egyptian practice. Otherwise why tell them not to do so?</i> Now the desert generation, who were taught by Moses for forty years, did not have to work, for their bread was freely given and their water faithfully delivered. The manna, which they were not in the habit of eating in Egypt, in contrast to the types of food which they desired,<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 11:5.</i> instilled wisdom. Nevertheless, Moses told this generation at the end of forty years, <i>but the Lord hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day</i> (Deut. 29:3). We are thus amazed as to how it was possible to find the above-noted number<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">Over 79,000.</i> of wise and understanding men.<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">So soon after the Exodus when, as noted in Deut. 29:3, forty years later such men were a rarity.</i> It appears to me that <i>the rulers of thousands</i> were men who had under them a thousand people, namely, slaves, young men, or hired hands. It is possible that these were the heads of the tribes and that they numbered twelve. The rulers of hundreds were many. The rulers of fifties were so called after the manner of <i>and fifty men to run before him</i> (II Sam. 15:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they each had fifty servants. Thus ruler over thousands, hundreds, etc., does not refer to judges in charge of a thousand Israelites, a hundred Israelites, etc., but to the amount of wealth possessed by the people from whom the judges were chosen.</i>

Verse 22

AND LET THEM JUDGE THE PEOPLE. When the people have a matter. What they do not know how to judge you will judge. If you do not know it, then <i>bring thou the causes unto God</i> (v. 19).

Verse 23

THEN THOU SHALT BE ABLE. The <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-yakholta</i> (then thou shalt be able)<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yakholta</i> can be taken to mean: and thou shalt be able. Hence I.E.’s comment that it means: then thou shalt be able.</i> is like the Arabic <i>fah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">It does not necessarily mean “and.” See I.E. on Gen. 1:2 and the notes thereto.</i> If you do this thing, and God grants you permission to do it, then you will be able to endure. Now the word <i>amod</i> (endure) is an infinitive. It is like the word <i>amod</i> (stand)<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">Which is an infinitive.</i> in <i>Stand in the door of the tent</i> (Jud. 4:20). <i>Peshotah</i> (strip you) <i>ve-orah</i> (and make you bare), <i>va-chagorah</i> (and gird) in <i>Strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your lions</i> (Is. 32:11) are also infinitives.
[AND ALL THIS PEOPLE ALSO SHALL GO TO THEIR PLACE IN PEACE.] Its meaning is, when some the disputants who were standing before Moses were not able to present their cases before him<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, before you. For Jethro addressed Moses.</i> for adjudication, their conflict intensified when they returned to their tents. However, now<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">If Jethro’s advice were followed.</i> each one would return to his place, that is, his tent, in peace. 

Verse 24

[SO MOSES HEARKENED.] Scripture mentions Jethro’s council but does not mention Moses’ council.<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture in our chapter notes that Jethro advised Moses to appoint judges and that Moses followed his advice. However, it omits telling us that Moses decided not only to appoint judges but to appoint officers as well.</i> Moses added to Jethro’s council: that is, Moses placed officers over the tribes to enforce the decrees of the judges. Scripture thus reads, <i>and officers, tribe by tribe</i> (Deut. 1:15), and <i>Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates</i> (Deut. 16:18).

Verse 25

AND MOSES CHOSE ABLE MEN. This thing was ascertainable. <i>Such as fear God</i><sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 21.</i> is not mentioned, for only God knows what is in a person’s heart. Moses said that he chose wise men for us, for he was able to ascertain this. However, there are wise men who are not God-fearing. Moses mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">That is, he appointed.</i> men <i>who are known</i> (Deut. 1:13),<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> that is, men whom people recognize. He did not mention them here because he was being brief.

Verse 26

THEY JUDGED THEMSELVES. <i>Yishputu</i> (judged) means the same as <i>yishpotu</i> (judged).<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">This is the more common form.</i> A <i>shuruk</i> has been substituted for a <i>cholam</i> in <i>yishputu.</i> It is similar to <i>lo ta’avuri</i> (neither pass) in <i>neither pass from hence</i> (Ruth 2:5), which has the same meaning as <i>ve-lo ta’avori</i> (and neither pass).<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta’avori is</i> the more common form.</i> However, Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi.</i> wanted to distinguish between them<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">Between <i>yishputu</i> and <i>yishpotu.</i> Rashi implies that <i>yishpotu</i> is an imperative and <i>yishputu</i> a participle. See Rashi on verse 26.</i> but was unable to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">As they mean the same thing.</i> Now from a grammatical standpoint the following may be said. We find the terms <i>chadelu</i> (ceased)<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form.</i> and <i>chadellu</i> (ceased) with a <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>lamed</i> because it is marked with an <i>etnach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">What is commonly referred to as an <i>etnachtah.</i></i> in <i>The rulers ceased</i> (chadelu) <i>in Israel, they ceased</i> (chadellu) (Jud. 5:7). We similarly find the word <i>nazollu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>nazelu,</i> the usual form.</i> (quake) at the end of a verse in <i>That the mountains may quake</i> (Is. 63:19). Scripture likewise reads, <i>tehatellu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>tehatelu</i> the usual form.</i> <i>vo</i> (will ye mock him) (Job 13:9) since <i>tehatellu</i> is considered<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “they” considered <i>tehatellu</i> to be the last word, etc.</i> to be the last word in the sentence because it is connected to the word <i>vo,</i> which has only one vowel. Similarly, <i>yishpetu hem</i> is like <i>yishputu</i> (hem),<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they mean the same but are vocalized differently because one (<i>yishpetu</i>) comes in the middle of a sentence and the other (<i>yishputu</i>) at the end of a sentence.</i> for one can say<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">Thus who would dispute this point by saying that the <i>etnachtah</i> and the <i>sof pasuk</i> equally change the word’s vocalization.

Observe the word <i>yippelu</i> (fall) in <i>The peoples fall under thee</i> (Ps. 45:6); <i>yeminekha</i> (thy right hand) in <i>The Lord at thy right hand</i> (Ps. 110:5); <i>avdekha</i> (thy servant) in <i>Thou hast dealt well with Thy servant</i> (Ps. 119:65)<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">All of these words have an <i>etnachtah</i> beneath them and maintain their normal vowels.

Chapter 19



Verse 1

IN THE THIRD MONTH. We do not know the meaning of <i>the same day</i> (ba-yom ha-zeh)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">We do not know what this phrase refers to.</i> unless the interpretation of Rabbi Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For his identity, see I.E. on Ex. 2:4 and the notes thereto.</i> to the effect that it<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ba-chodesh</i> (in the month) which opens our verse. See note 5.</i> refers to the new moon is correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of the Talmud (<i>Sabbath</i> 86b), the <i>Mekhilta</i> (<i>Parshat Yitro</i>), and Rashi, as well. Ibn Ezra apparently quoted Rabbi Moses’ opinion because it can be linguistically defended, while the Talmud derives it from a <i>gezerah shavah.</i> See <i>Sabbath</i> 86b. Also see next note.</i> It is like <i>Tomorrow is the new moon</i> (I Sam 20:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse opens with <i>ba-chodesh ha-shelishi</i> (in the third month). According to Rabbi Moses the word <i>chodesh</i> means new moon, as in I Sam. 20:18 which reads <i>machar ha-chodesh</i> (tomorrow is the new moon). According to Rabbi Moses our verse should be interpreted as follows: On the third new moon, i.e., on the first day of the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day, i.e., on the aforementioned new moon, came they into the wilderness of Sinai. It should be noted that on Ex. 12:2, I.E. quotes Rabbi Moses as saying that the term <i>rosh chodesh</i> (new moon) is tautological because the word <i>chodesh</i> by itself means new moon.</i> Scripture notes this<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai on the first day of the third month.</i> because the Torah was given a few days after Israel camped.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Around Mount Sinai.</i> Perhaps Moses went up to God<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 3.</i> on day one<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Of the third month. In other words, what is reported in verses 3-6 occurred on the first day.</i> and then came down and spoke to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">On the second day of the month (Krinsky), relating all that God had told him on the first day of the month. See verses 7 and 8.</i> Then on the third day of the month he went up again to report the words of the people to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Part II of verse 8.</i> It was then told to Moses that the giving of the Torah would take place on the third day.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> All of this is by way of logical exegesis because we accept the tradition<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Recorded in <i>Sabbath</i> 86b.</i> that the Torah was given on the sixth day of Sivan.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that if there were no tradition that the Torah was given on the sixth of Sivan, there would be no need to say that what is reported in verse 3 took place on day one, that what is reported in verses 7 and 8 took place on day two and most importantly that what is reported in verse 11 took place on the third day. However, once we have the tradition that the Torah was given on the sixth of Sivan we may logically interpret the above verse so. Cf. <i>Sabbath</i> 86b: “The Decalogue was given on the sixth (of the month of Sivan). Rabbi Jose says on the seventh.”</i> According to the rules of the calendar, if<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For some reason.</i> a day was not added to the month of Iyyar,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, if Iyyar had 29 days as it usually does.</i> then the Torah was given on a Friday.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis of the Talmud (<i>Sabbath</i> 87b), Israel left Egypt on a Thursday. Now if the new moon at that time was not consecrated by observation but rather by following the rules of the Hebrew calendar, then the sixth of Sivan had to fall on a Friday. See chapter 1 of the <i>Mekhilta</i> on the Torah portion <i>Be-Shallach.</i></i> It is possible that Scripture reads, <i>the same day</i> because the distance<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>merchak</i> as in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 rather than <i>rachok</i> as in the printed editions.</i> from Rephidim and Mount Sinai was greater than the distance between each journey.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>the same day</i> refers to the day that they left Rephidim. Our verse thus tells us that Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai on the same day that they left Rephidim. Scripture notes this because unlike the other journeys, which were normally a day’s journey apart, Rephidim and Sinai were far apart. Yet Israel made the journey in one day. From this comment it is clear that I.E. had serious doubts about whether <i>ba-chodesh ha-shelishi</i> really means on the first day of the third month.</i>

Verse 2

AND WHEN THEY WERE DEPARTED FROM REPHIDIM.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>And they departed from Rephidim.</i> Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Its meaning is, they had already departed from Rephidim.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1 tells us that Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai. Thus, <i>And they departed from Rephidim</i> is out of place here, for Israel departed from Rephidim before they came to Sinai. Hence <i>va-yisu</i> is to be rendered: and they had already departed, rather than: and they departed. J.P.S. translates accordingly.</i> I have pointed out to you many other such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Where a verb beginning with a conversive <i>vav</i> is a pluperfect. See Vol. 1, page XVI.</i>
THEY ENCAMPED IN THE WILDERNESS. The previously mentioned wilderness of Sinai.
[AND THERE ISRAEL ENCAMPED.] Scripture reads, <i>and there Israel encamped,</i> after stating, <i>they encamped in the wilderness,</i> because the heads of the tribes and the elders camped before the mountain due to their respected positions.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>they encamped in the wilderness</i> refers to the heads of the tribes.</i> As I will explain,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 17.</i> Israel stood around the mountain, in accordance with their status, on the day the Torah was given. Scripture uses the singular form <i>va-yichan</i> (encamped) because they<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The heads of the tribes.</i> were few in number. Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi.</i> says that <i>before</i> (mi-neged) <i>the mount</i> means on the eastern side of the mountain. However, Scripture states, <i>a good way off</i> (mineged) <i>shall they pitch, round about</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the word <i>neged</i> (before) does not mean east, for Scripture goes on to say, <i>round about</i> (saviv). Hence the word <i>neged</i> can refer to any direction.</i> <i>the tent of meeting</i> (Num. 2:2), namely, on all sides of the tent of meeting. For<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This is not a reason for what comes before but an elaboration.</i> as the standards journeyed,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The tribes journeyed by standards. There were four standards for the 12 tribes, one for every three tribes.</i> so did they camp.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Three sides per side of the tent of meeting.</i>

Verse 3

AND MOSES WENT UP UNTO GOD. Scripture above reads, <i>before the mount</i> (v. 2). Its meaning thus is: and Moses went up to the mount of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The word mount in verse 2 is carried over to verse 3. Thus, <i>unto God</i> is to be understood as if written: unto the mount of God.</i>
[AND THE LORD CALLED UNTO HIM.] Its meaning is,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See note 22.</i> and the Lord had already called him.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Before he ascended the mountain.</i> For Moses would not have ascended without permission.
[OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN.] Scripture says this<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">That God called to Moses from out of the mountain, when in fact He called to him from heaven.</i> becauce Moses did not ascend above the mountain.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. was troubled lest <i>And Moses went up unto God</i> be taken to mean that Moses ascended into heaven. Indeed, there are some Midrashim who do say this.</i> For the Lord spoke to Moses on the mountain. Do not be bothered by the fact that Scripture afterwards states, <i>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai</i> (v. 20),<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies that up to now God spoke to Moses from heaven.</i> for the Torah says this from the point of view of Israel when they beheld the cloud and fire. Scripture explicitly states, <i>and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire</i> (Deut. 4:36).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">It thus appeared to Israel that God came down on Sinai amidst the fire.</i>
[SAYING.]<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to say. Hence I.E.’s comment</i> Its meaning is that the Lord<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. Some of the printed editions have <i>ha-am.</i> This appears to be an error for <i>ha-shem.</i></i> called Moses to tell him: <i>Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob</i>). The meaning is, say something relating to all of<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38.</i> the house of Jacob, to those alive today and to their children after them.
[AND TELL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] The reference is to the elders. The elders will then tell all of the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">All the words that you will tell them, namely, that which is recorded in verses 4-6.</i> We thus read, <i>And Moses came and called for the elders of the people</i> (v. 7),<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The house of Jacob</i> is not mentioned.</i> and it is then written, <i>And all the people answered together</i> (v. 8).
[HOUSE.] I have previously explained the meaning of the word house (Ex. 1:1).

Verse 4

YE HAVE SEEN. The vengeance that I executed upon the Egyptians on your behalf, and that I bore you out of Egypt as if you were carried on the wings of eagles. For an eagle flies higher in the air than any other bird. All birds are afraid of him and he fears no bird. [I BORE YOU ON EAGLES’ WINGS.] Moses employed a similar metaphor later on when he said, <i>As an eagle that stirreth up her nest</i> (Deut. 32:11),<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">That is, our verse is like Deut. 32:11 in which Moses describes the Exodus in a manner similar to the way he does in our verse.</i> that is, it slowly leads its young.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">It has no need to rush as it fears no other bird.</i> Moses similarly referred to the clouds<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The pillar of cloud which accompanied Israel.</i> when he said, <i>Spreadeth abroad her wings</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>).
AND BROUGHT YOU UNTO MYSELF. In that God’s glory came down upon this mountain. This is the holy mountain referred to by Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">In Ex. 15:13.</i> Now Moses said,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This appears to be an error, as this was said by God to Moses. See Weiser and Krinsky, who suggest this reading: Now Moses was told. If there is no error in the text, then what I.E. means is that Moses in writing the Torah quoted God as saying this. However, see the reading from <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 in the next note.</i> <i>ye shall serve God upon this mountain</i> (Ex. 3:12). The latter is the same as <i>Thy holy habitation</i> (Ex. 15:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">So too I.E. on Ex. 15:13, where he explains that <i>Thy holy habitation</i> refers to Mount Sinai. <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 reads: In that God’s glory came down upon this mountain which is a holy mountain. This is what Moses meant by <i>Thy holy habitation</i> (Ex. 15:13).</i>

Verse 5

NOW THEREFORE, IF YE WILL HEARKEN UNTO MY VOICE. To observe my commandments and keep the covenant which I will make with you. The reference, as I will explain with irrefutable proofs in the proper place,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, its place. Krinsky and Weiser claim that the reference is to Ex. 24:8. However, neither there nor anywhere else does I.E. prove that the covenant mentioned here is the one made after the revelation.</i> is to the covenant made by Moses with Israel after the giving of the Torah, when he built the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 24:4-8.</i>
[TREASURE.] The word <i>segullah</i> (treasure) means something precious, lovely, and unique.
[FOR ALL THE EARTH IS MINE.] This is connected to <i>all peoples</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned earlier in the verse.</i> The clause is to be interpreted: for all the peoples of the earth are mine. This is what Scripture means by <i>and</i> [I] <i>set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine</i> (Lev. 20:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 20:26 repeats in different words what our verse says.</i> Rabbi Merinus says that <i>ki li kol ha-aretz</i> (for all the earth is mine) means: even though all the earth is mine.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ki</i> (for) here means even though.</i> I believe that this is the case with <i>ki am keseh oref attah</i> (it is a stiffnecked people) (Ex. 32:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning being, even though (<i>ki</i>) it is a stiff-necked people.</i> and <i>refah nafshi ki chatati lakh</i> (Heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee) (Ps. 41:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning being, heal my soul, even though (<i>ki</i>) I have sinned against thee.</i>

Verse 6



Verse 7

AND MOSES CAME. To the camp of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Moses came down from the mountain and went to the camp of Israel.</i> There is no need to mention that Moses descended.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">For that is understood.</i>
AND SET BEFORE THEM. As in <i>And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel</i> (Deut. 4:44).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, set means transmitted (Weiser).</i> However, the Gaon says that the word set is used here in the same way as the word set in <i>set</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> <i>it in their mouths</i> (Deut. 31:19). The reference<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 31:19. In other words, <i>set it in their mouths</i> means: teach them the law, which they will transmit with their mouth, viz., the oral law.</i> is to the oral law which explains the written law.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, set means to teach.</i>

Verse 8

TOGETHER. The word <i>yachdav</i> (together) is grammatically unique<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 13:6 and the notes thereto.</i> in Scripture because of the added <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> serves no purpose. The word should have read <i>yachad.</i></i> Yefet explains it to mean alone, by oneself, without anybody else there.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, according to Yefet <i>yachdav</i> does not mean together, which is the meaning of <i>yachad,</i> but as one person. For the differences in nuance see I.E. on Gen. 13:6, note 10.</i>
[REPORTED.] Scripture mentions, <i>and Moses reported,</i> but has no need to mention that Moses went up<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">To Mount Sinai to report the people’s words to God.</i> because Scripture is being brief.

Verse 9

AND THE LORD SAID. What reason is there for saying, <i>And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord</i> (v. 9) after having said,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 8.</i> <i>And Moses reported the words of the people unto the Lord</i>? Note that there are many verses in the Torah that should have come earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Than they are presently positioned.</i> Their meaning is that such and such already took place.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the verbs opening these verses are pluperfects. See verse 2 and the notes thereto.</i> For example, the meaning of <i>va-yitzar</i> (formed) in, <i>Then the Lord God formed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Man.</i> (Gen. 2:7) is, He<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord God.</i> had already formed;<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Man earlier, for the creation of man is described in the first chapter of Genesis.</i> the meaning of <i>va-yatzmach</i> (made to grow) in <i>And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow</i> (Gen. 2:9) is, He had already made to grow;<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen 1:8 and the notes thereto.</i> the meaning of <i>va-yomer</i> (and said) in <i>and said: Whose daughter art thou?</i> (Gen. 24:23) is, and he<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham’s servant to Rebekah.</i> had already said.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Whose daughter art thou?</i> before giving Rebekah a ring and bracelets. See I.E. on Gen. 24:14 and the notes thereto.</i> Indeed, Scripture explicitly states,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">In repeating the events described in Gen. 24:22,23.</i> <i>And I asked her, and said</i> (Gen. 24:47),<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Whose daughter art thou?</i></i> and then,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Goes on to say.</i> <i>I put the ring upon her nose</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). Similarly, the meaning of <i>And she</i><sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Rebekah.</i> <i>said unto the servant</i> (Gen. 24:65) is, and she had already said unto the servant,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us?</i></i> and then, <i>she alighted from the camel</i> (Gen. 24:64).<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">For the reason, see I.E. on Gen. 24:64 and the notes thereto.</i> There is no need to elaborate.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Although there are many other instances of Scripture’s use of the pluperfect, for the point has been proven.</i> Now the meaning of <i>And Moses told</i> here<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 9.</i> is, and Moses had already told. Scripture does not mention what Moses told.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord in the name of the people.</i> The word <i>higid</i> (told) always refers to something new that has not previously been mentioned. It is thus not connected to <i>and Moses reported</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>And Moses told</i> (verse 9) does not refer to <i>and Moses reported.</i></i> From God’s answer to Moses, “<i>Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud</i>” (v. 9), we learn what Moses told.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">God. In the next paragraph, I.E. goes on to explain what Moses told God.</i> Furthermore, as I will explain,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Later on in the commentary.</i> we find this clearly stated in Moses’ very words. Note that the Egyptians and the Indians are from the children of Ham. Each one relies on the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">For their traditions and customs. I.E. makes a similar point in Gen. 46:34.</i> The people of India do not eat meat. The Egyptians used to do the same. They changed their practice only because the kingdom of Ishmael<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">The Arabs. I.E. did not consider the Egyptians as Arabs. In fact, neither did the Egyptians consider themselves Arabs until modern times.</i> overpowered them and they accepted the religion of the Ishmaelites. The Indian sages offer proofs in accordance with their thinking that it is impossible for God to talk to a person and for that person to live. Now the Israelites were in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">For a long time and came under Egyptian influence.</i> There were among them people who followed this belief.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">That God does not communicate with man.</i> They were in doubt about Moses’ prophecy. <i>And they believed in the Lord, and in His servant Moses</i> (Ex. 14:31) does not dispute this.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">That there were Israelites who doubted that God spoke with Moses.</i> For Scripture reads, <i>And Israel saw</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). It does not say: and all Israel saw.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The verse which reads, <i>And they believed in the Lord, and his servant Moses</i> opens with <i>And Israel saw.</i> Since the latter only applies to a part of the people, so does the former. Hence <i>And they believed in the Lord, and his servant Moses</i> refers to part of the people, not to all of the people.</i> Even if it read, all of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Saw.</i> it would speak of the majority as is the style of the language,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Biblical style.</i> as in <i>and all the cattle of Egypt died</i> (Ex. 9:6),<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">As a result of <i>a very grievous murrain</i> (Ex. 9:4).</i> which is followed by <i>Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle</i> (Ex. 9:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">So that they will not be struck by the hail. Now all the cattle had previously died, so where did these cattle come from? Hence <i>and all the cattle of Egypt died</i> means: and most of the cattle of Egypt died.</i>
[LO, I COME UNTO THEE.] This is to be understood as an answer to Moses, who told this<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">That some Israelites doubted the possibility of prophecy.</i> to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. verse 9 reads as follows: <i>And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever.</i> But Moses had previously told the words of the people to God. The verse is to be understood as follows: And Moses told the words of the people to God; that is, Moses told God that some Israelites doubted that the Lord speaks to any human being. God answered, <i>Lo I come unto thee in a thick cloud,</i> etc.</i>
[IN A THICK CLOUD.] When God will descend upon the mountain.
WHEN I SPEAK WITH THEE. The Decalogue. They will then believe that God in truth speaks with a person and he lives.
[AND MAY ALSO BELIEVE THEE.] That you are a prophet. All doubt will be removed from their minds. It is explicitly written, <i>we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth</i> (Deut. 5:21). It is also written there, <i>For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?</i> (Deut. 5:23). And it is there written, <i>Go thou near, and hear</i> (Deut. 5:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">The word of God and report it back to us. Israel said this to Moses.</i> This is what Scripture means by <i>and may also believe thee for ever.</i>

AND THE LORD SAID…SANCTIFY THEM TO-DAY AND TOMORROW. Observe, God enlarged the time allotted for Israel’s sanctification by giving them the rest of this day and the morrow.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">To sanctify themselves.</i>
[AND SANCTIFY THEM.] By washing in water. This is indicated by <i>and let them wash their garments.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Which follows. As their garments were sanctified by washing, so were they sanctified by washing themselves.</i> Our verse is to be interpreted after the manner of <i>But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh</i> (Lev. 17:16). Moses therefore said, starting from now, <i>come not near a woman</i> (v. 15) so that they would be sanctified and not be unclean. One who drew near to a women should sanctify himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">By bathing.</i> as in <i>for she was purified</i><sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">By bathing. See II Sam. 11:2.</i> <i>from her uncleanliness</i> (II Sam. 11:4).

Verse 11

AND BE READY. Its meaning might be that no person among them should sleep during the night, after the manner of the high priest on Yom Kippur,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">The high priest did not sleep the entire night of Yom Kippur. See Mishnah <i>Yoma</i> 1:7. Ibn Ezra takes issue with Midrash, which states that Israel overslept on the morning that the Torah was given. See chapter 42 of <i>Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer.</i></i> as Israel would hear God’s voice in the morning.

Verse 12

AND THOU SHALT SET BOUNDS. Place a border on the mount.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical text reads, <i>And thou shalt set bounds</i> (ve-higbalta) <i>unto the people.</i> I.E. interprets this to mean: And thou shalt set bounds on the mount beyond which the people may not cross.</i> <i>Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it</i> (v. 23) is therefore similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">For it repeats what is implied in our verse.</i> I dwell on this because the crazy one<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Some identify him with Isaac, son of Solomon Israeli (850-950), a court physician to the caliphs of Egypt and Kairouan.

Filwarg interprets: one is only prohibited from physically touching the mountain. However, one may cast an object upon it. See next verse.</i>

Verse 13

NO HAND SHALL TOUCH HIM. The word <i>bo</i> (him) refers to the person who touches the mount.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>bo</i> also means “it.” Thus our verse may be taken to mean, no hand shall touch it, that is, the mountain (see previous note).

On the contrary, those who see him shall immediately stone him from where they are standing or shall shoot him through with arrows if he be distant.
[SHOT THROUGH.] The word <i>yiyareh</i> (shot through) differs from its counterparts.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Other stems which have a <i>yod</i> as their first letter. The root of <i>yiyareh</i> is <i>yod, resh, heh.</i></i> For the rule pertaining to roots that have a <i>yod</i> as their first letter is that the <i>yod</i> changes to a <i>vav</i> in the <i>nifal</i> imperfect, as in the word <i>yivvada</i> (be known)<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>yod</i>, <i>dalet, ayin.</i></i> in <i>and the plenty shall not be known</i> (Gen. 41:31) and <i>va-ivvaser</i> (and I was chastised)<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>yod, samekh, resh.</i></i> in <i>Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised</i> (Jer. 31:18).

Hence in one the <i>yod</i> changed into a <i>vav,</i> as is the rule, and in the other the <i>yod</i> remained unchanged.</i> For the <i>alef</i> and the <i>heh</i> are silent at the end of the word and there is no difference in pronunciation between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is easy to confuse these two words.</i>
WHETHER IT BE BEAST OR MAN, IT SHALL NOT LIVE. Not so a bird as it cannot be taken, for it immediately flies away.
WHEN THE RAM’S HORN SOUNDETH LONG. <i>Yovel</i> (ram) is a lamb.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the <i>shofar</i> which is made from a ram’s horn, is by extension referred to as a <i>yovel.</i> Thus <i>bi-meshokh ha-yovel</i> is to be rendered: when the ram’s horn soundeth long. I.E. uses the term <i>keves,</i> which means a lamb. He probably meant a ram. See <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 26a.</i> Jubilee (<i>yovel</i>) is so called because Scripture states, <i>Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of a shofar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. renders it as the horn.</i> (Lev. 25:9), and the <i>shofar</i> is made from the horns of a lamb.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yovel</i> is so called because it is inaugurated by the sounding of the <i>shofar,</i> which is made from a ram’s horn.</i> It is similarly written, <i>And it shall be, that when they make a long blast with the horn of the yovel,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. renders it as the ram’s horn.</i> <i>and when ye hear the sound of the shofar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S. renders it as the horn. We thus see that <i>shofar</i> and <i>yovel</i> refer to one and the same thing.</i> (Josh. 6:5). One must wonder at those who say that <i>And when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke</i> (v. 19) refers to <i>when the ram’s horn</i><sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ha-yovel.</i></i> <i>soundeth long</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, verse 19 and our verse refer to the same event.</i> For the voice of the horn<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in verse 19.</i> was a great wonder;<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas the sound of the ram’s horn in our verse was a normal event.</i> there was no greater wonder at that assembly around Mount Sinai. For sounds of thunder, lightning, and a thick cloud are also visible in the world. However, the voice of the horn<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in verse 19.</i> was unheard of until the day of the Decalogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">For it was not made by a <i>shofar.</i></i> Behold, the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Of the <i>shofar</i> spoken of in verse 19.</i> was not from the horn of a lamb.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">But was a special sound created for the occasion.</i>
[WHEN THE RAM’S HORN SOUNDETH LONG, THEY SHALL COME UP TO THE MOUNT.] The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah Gaon.</i> says<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">That its meaning is.</i> that when Moses sounds the horn it will give them permission to ascend.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Mount Sinai. In other words, the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> will signal that one is permitted to climb Mount Sinai.</i> This took place after Moses descended<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Mount Sinai.</i> on the Day of Atonement and commanded that the tabernacle be constructed
THEY SHALL COME UP TO THE MOUNT. Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni says that “they” refers to Aaron, Aaron’s sons, and the seventy elders concerning whom it is written, <i>And unto Moses He said: Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel</i> (Ex. 24:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Samuel, <i>when the ram’s horn soundeth long</i> means when the ram’s horn soundeth long after the revelation. Rabbi Samuel thus disagrees with Saadiah’s interpretation that the reference is to the Day of Atonement when Moses descended Sinai.</i> However, Moses did not give permission to the rest of the people to ascend Mount Sinai. He therefore said “they” and not others. His words appear good in my sight. For the glory was continually on Sinai until the tabernacle was erected, as it is written, <i>and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle</i> (Ex. 4:34). God then spoke with Moses in the tent of meeting. Perhaps Moses then sounded the horn<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Once again.</i> and now that the glory was gone,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">From Mount Sinai.</i> God gave him<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Moses.</i> permission to ascend.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">That is, God gave Moses permission to permit the people to ascend Mount Sinai.</i>

Verse 14

AND MOSES WENT DOWN…AND SANCTIFIED THE PEOPLE. As I have already explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 10.</i>

Verse 15

BE READY AGAINST THE THIRD DAY. The meaning of <i>li-sheloshet yamim</i> is, for the third day. According to the plain meaning of the text, Moses did not add a day by himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11 tells us that God told Moses, <i>ve-hayu nekhonim la-yom ha-shelishi</i> (and be ready against the third day). However, our verse reports that Moses told Israel, <i>heyu nekhonim li-sheloshet yamim</i> (be ready against the third day). According to the Rabbinic sage Rabbi Jose, Moses told Israel be ready for three days (which is the literal meaning of <i>heyu nekhonim li-sheloshet yamim</i>). That is, God will reveal himself to you on the fourth day. Moses thus added another day on his own. See <i>Sabbath</i> 87a.</i> I will bring two faithful witnesses,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">That there is no difference between <i>li-sheloshet ha-yamim</i> and <i>la-yom ha-shelishi.</i></i> both of which are found in this book. Now it is written, <i>And he put them all together into ward three days</i> (sheloset yamim) (Gen. 42:17). It is then written, <i>And Joseph said unto them the third day</i> (yom ha-shelishi) (Gen. 42:18). Scripture also states, <i>within yet three days</i> (sheloshet yamim) <i>shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee</i> (Gen. 40:19). It is then written, <i>And it came to pass the third day</i> (ba-yom ha-shelishi) (Gen. 40:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Scripture interchanges <i>sheloshet yamim</i> and <i>yom ha-shelishi.</i> Hence they must have one meaning.</i> Similarly here, <i>heyu nekhnim li-sheloshet yamim</i> [means be ready for the third day].

Verse 16

AND A THICK CLOUD UPON THE MOUNT. Upon the mount alone. The same applies to the thunder and lightning.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">They were only over the mount.</i>
[EXCEEDING LOUD.] Its meaning is, louder than the voice of any <i>shofar</i> (horn) that they ever heard.
AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE CAMP TREMBLED. Because of the sound of the <i>shofar</i> (horn).

Verse 17

AND MOSES BROUGHT FORTH.

Moses similarly said, <i>I stood between the Lord and you</i> (Deut. 5:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Now since the people were at the foot of the mountain, Moses, who stood between the people and God, had to be on the mountain.</i>

Verse 18

NOW MOUNT SINAI WAS ALTOGETHER ON SMOKE.

For <i>ashan,</i> is a verb not a noun.</i> Do not be surprised at the word for smoke<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">That Scripture employs two forms for the Hebrew word for smoke.</i> since Scripture reads, <i>ke-eshen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of which is <i>eshen,</i> vocalized <i>segol, segol</i> (<i>pe’el</i>).</i> <i>ha-kivshan</i> (as the smoke of the furnace) after saying, <i>va-ya’al ashano</i><sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of which is <i>ashan,</i> vocalized <i>kamatz, kamatz</i> (<i>pa’al</i>).</i> (and the smoke thereof ascended).

AND THE WHOLE MOUNT QUAKED GREATLY. The reverse of the usual, for mountains do not move. It is only by way of parable that Scripture states, <i>And the hills did tremble</i> (Is. 5:25).

Verse 19

AND WHEN THE VOICE OF THE HORN WAXED LOUDER AND LOUDER. The normal thing is for the sound of the <i>shofar</i> to be stronger when first sounded.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">And then to grow weaker.</i> However, the reverse was the case here.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">For the voice of the <i>shofar,</i> grew louder and louder.</i> Perhaps God made it sound weaker at the beginning so that Israel would not lose heart out of fright.
MOSES SPOKE. According to Saadiah Gaon, God periodically stopped the sound of the <i>shofar,</i> at which time Moses spoke<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">To God.</i> with a loud voice. God then answered Moses with a voice, as in <i>then he</i> [Moses] <i>heard the Voice speaking unto him</i> (Num. 7:89). It is concerning this that Scripture states, <i>that the people may hear when I speak with thee</i> (v. 9). However, I have already told you<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on verse 9.</i> that in my opinion, <i>when I speak with thee</i> refers to the Decalogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">And not to any other conversation between Moses and Israel.</i> 
<i>Moses spoke</i> is to be explained by connecting it to <i>the voice of the horn</i> (shofar). Moses’ soul cleaved unto God.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he was able to speak to God.</i> Moses spoke with God from the foot of the mountain and asked something of God. However, Scripture does not reveal what Moses asked. God answered Moses with a voice audible to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">With a voice audible only to Moses. Cf. I.E.’s short commentary.</i> The sound of the <i>shofar,</i> although very loud, did not prevent Moses from hearing the voice. Because of this,<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">That is, because Moses was at the foot of the mountain.</i> Scripture states afterwards, <i>and the Lord called Moses</i> with the sound of a voice and told him to ascend the mountain where the glory of God was.

Verse 20

AND THE LORD CAME DOWN. I will now convey a general principle that will satisfy you<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that will temporarily satisfy anyone who is troubled by anthropomorphism, i.e., <i>And the Lord came down.</i></i> until, with God’s help, I will come to the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa,</i> where I will explain extremely deep things to you very clearly. Know that man’s soul is extolled and glorious. It comes from the middle world.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. there are three worlds. For I.E.’s description of them see his comments on Ex. 3:15.</i> However, man’s body comes from the inferior world. The only one in this inferior world who has the ability to speak is man. Likewise the hearer, that is, the person to whom the speaker wants to convey what is in the speaker’s heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra’s point is that the one who speaks and the one to whom speech i s directed are both humans.</i> An intelligent person cannot invent speech.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">In the Middle Ages philosophers did not coin new words to express their ideas.</i> He must employ the language that is known and used. All languages are built upon the arrangement of the human form,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Language uses figures of the human body or its parts to convey ideas.</i> which is made up of an incorporeal soul and a body made out of four elements.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, four roots.</i> Now when a person speaks to a fellow human being in a language that the latter knows, he understands the speaker’s words and their forms in their arrangements. If one wants to speak of things that are on a lower level than human beings, he has to raise their level and give them human form so that anyone who hears him will understand his words. Hence they<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">The composers of Scripture.</i> attributed a head to the earth, as in <i>The head of the dust of the world</i> (Prov. 8:26),<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. slightly misquotes this verse.</i> a mouth to the earth, as in <i>And the earth opened her mouth</i> (Num. 16:32), and a side, as in <i>from the sides of the earth</i> (Jer. 6:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> We similarly find, the <i>head of the Jordan</i> (Num. 13:29)<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> and <i>in the heart of the sea</i> (Ex. 15:8). There are many such instances. Now they are all metaphoric, for the sea has no heart. Furthermore, they picture one part of the body as if it had the form of the entire body. Thus Scripture says, <i>Death and life are in the hand of the tongue</i> (Prov. 18:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. That is, Scripture pictures the tongue as having a hand.</i> There are many such cases. Similarly, when a person wants to speak of things more important than he, namely, of things from the upper world, he brings them down to his level and anthropomorphizes them, speaking of them as if they had human form. All this is done so that the hearer can be understood. Scripture thus reads, <i>the man Gabriel</i> (Dan. 9:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Gabriel is an angel. However, Scripture speaks of him in human terms. According to I.E. angels are disembodied intelligences and have no human form.</i> Scripture similarly speaks of <i>his</i><sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Gabriel’s.</i> <i>arms and his feet</i> (Dan. 10:6) and tells us, <i>and the voice of his</i><sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Gabriel’s</i> <i>words</i> [was] <i>like the voice of a multitude</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). They [the writers of Scripture] took hold of this style of speech when describing the Most High.

[AND THE LORD CALLED MOSES TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNT.] The reason the Lord called Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">To come up to the top of the mountain.</i> was so that Israel would see Moses’ greatly elevated state, namely, that he reached the top of the mountain where there was the glory of God, whose words the people would hear from the fire that was there.

Verse 24

Chapter 20



Verse 1

AND GOD SPOKE. There are some very difficult questions to be raised in this chapter. Many say that God only uttered the first two statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical term for what is known in the western world as the Ten Commandments is <i>aseret ha-devarim</i> (Deut. 4:13; 10:4), the ten words or the ten statements. This is term that will be employed in this work.</i> As proof they offer the fact that the first statement reads, <i>I am the Lord thy God</i> (v. 2), and the second, <i>for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God</i> (v. 5).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the first two statements are in the first person while the next three are in the third person. Hence they assume that only the first two were uttered by God. These commentaries also assume that statements 6-10 were spoken by Moses, as it is illogical to assume that God would utter two statements first, that Moses would then utter three statements, and that the Lord would then resume speaking. Thus the first question to be raised i n this chapter is, did God utter all ten statements or only the first two? If he uttered all the statements, why is there a change in person after the first two?</i> However, the third statement reads, <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</i> (v. 7) and does not say “My” name; the fourth reads, <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it</i> (v. 11); the fifth reads, <i>that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</i> (v. 12). One may ask, how can <i>I am the Lord</i> be counted among the Ten Statements,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As Jewish tradition does.</i> as God is the one who commands?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>I am the Lord</i> is an introductory statement to that which follows. That is, verse 3 is to be understood as follows: I am the Lord thy God…who commands you the following.</i> Clearly, <i>I am the Lord</i> is neither a positive nor a negative commandment. The following questions are even more difficult than the above-noted ones. When we read this chapter, namely, the Torah portion <i>Va-Yishma Yitro</i> (And Jethro heard)<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 18-20.</i> first, and then read the Torah portion <i>Va-Etchannan</i> (And I besought) (Deut. 3:23; 7:11), we notice that from <i>I am the Lord</i> (v. 2) through <i>the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain</i> (v. 7) there is no difference in the two portions.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The account of God’s revelation is described twice in the Torah, in <i>Yitro</i> and in <i>Va-Etchannan.</i></i> However, starting from <i>Remember</i> (v. 8) to the conclusion of the Ten Statements, there are differences in every place. <i>Yitro</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the first chapter.</i> reads, <i>Remember</i> (v. 5), while <i>Va-Etchannan</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the second chapter.</i> has, <i>Observe</i> (Deut. 5:12). The latter also ends with the addition, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee. Yitro</i> states, <i>nor thy cattle</i> (v. 10); <i>Va-Etchannan</i> adds, <i>nor thine ox, nor thine ass</i> (Deut. 5:14). More difficult than all of these is that the reason given for the Sabbath in <i>Yitro</i> is, <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</i> (v. 12). The verse then goes on to say, <i>wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it</i> (v. 12). Now these verses are not quoted in <i>Va-Etchannan,</i> which offers a totally different reason for the Sabbath. It states, <i>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt</i> (Deut. 5:15). The latter concludes with, <i>therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.</i> Scripture tells us in <i>Yitro</i> and in <i>Va-Etchannan</i> that the reward for honoring one’s father and mother is <i>that thy days may be long.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16.</i></i> However, <i>Va-Etchannan</i> adds, <i>and that it may go well with thee</i> (Deut. 5:16). It also adds, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) to the commandment dealing with honoring one’s father and mother. <i>Yitro</i> reads, <i>Thou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness</i> (v. 13). <i>Va-Etchannan</i> reads: <i>Thou shalt not murder. Neither shalt thou commit adultery. Neither shalt thou steal. Neither shalt thou bear false witness</i> (Deut. 5:17). <i>Yitro</i> reads, <i>ed sheker</i> (false witness) (v. 13). <i>Va-Etchannan</i> reads, <i>ed shav</i> (false witness) (Deut. 5:17). <i>Yitro</i> reads, <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> (lo tachmod) <i>thy neighbor’s house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (v. 14). <i>Va-Etchannan</i> has, <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s wife: neither shalt thou desire</i> (ve-lo titaweh) <i>thy neighbor’s house</i> (Deut. 5:18). It also has, <i>his field</i>. “His field” is missing in <i>Yitro.</i> In <i>Yitro, his man-servant, nor his maid-servant</i> precede <i>his ox, nor his ass</i> (v. 14). However, in <i>Va-Etchannan</i> (Deut. 5:18) <i>his ox, or his ass</i> precede <i>his man-servant, or his maid-servant.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is not so. In both versions <i>his man-servant</i> and <i>his maid-servant</i> precede <i>his ox</i> and <i>his ass.</i> I.E. obviously quoted from memory and committed a <i>faux pas.</i> Note: our verse and Deut. 5:18 are both translated literally.</i> <i>Yitro</i> states: <i>And God spoke all these words, saying</i> (v. 1). However, <i>Va-Etchannan</i> reads: <i>These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly</i> (Deut. 5:19). When we searched the words of our sages to see what they said concerning this, we found that they said, “<i>Remember</i> (v. 8) and <i>Observe</i> (Deut. 5:12) were uttered simultaneously.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta</i> on this verse.</i> Now this statement is, as I will explain, more difficult than all the other questions which we raised. Heaven forbid that I say the sages spoke incorrectly, for our minds are insignificant in comparison to theirs. The problem is that our contemporaries take the words of our sages at face value. However, this is not so, as I will explain after I finish noting all of the questions this chapter raises. I will then explain the proper way to remove all problems and questions pertaining to this chapter. <i>Observe</i> and <i>Remember</i> could have been uttered simultaneously only miraculously. Now even if we admit that a miracle did occur there is still room to ask why Scripture did not write <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> in <i>Yitro</i> and also in <i>Va-Etchannan</i>? Furthermore, what shall we do with the other verses that come in two versions? If we assume that they were simultaneously uttered, like <i>Observe</i> and <i>Remember,</i> why didn’t our sages of blessed memory mention it, as this is an even greater miracle? For even if we assume that two different words with one meaning can be uttered simultaneously, one can still ask, how is it possible for many verses with different meanings to be stated at the same time? Additionally, why would God say, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (Deut. 5:12)?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Why would God refer to himself in the third person (Krinsky)?</i> Furthermore, when before the assembly around Mount Sinai did the Lord command one to honor his father and mother?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">If we assume that God told Israel, <i>Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (Deut. 5:16). The question arises, when before this did God command Israel to honor their parents? The Bible never recorded such a command prior to the revelation at Sinai.</i> <i>Yitro</i> does not have, <i>that it may be well with thee</i> (Deut. 5:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In the fifth statement, but Deuteronomy does.</i> Hence God said this, or He did not say it.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Hence only one of the two versions was said by God.</i> Furthermore, how could God say, <i>Neither shalt thou commit adultery</i> (Deut. 5:17)?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This verse has a <i>vav</i> as a prefix while verse 14 does not.</i> Also, how could God say, <i>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14) and in <i>Va-Etchannan</i> say, <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (Deut. 5:18)?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is concentrating again on the prefix <i>vav</i> in Deuteronomy.</i> Additionally, how could God say, <i>his man-servant, or his maid-servant</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Yitro</i> (v. 14).</i> and then <i>his ox, or his ass,</i> and at the same time say the opposite?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">That is, place <i>his ox</i> and <i>his ass</i> before, <i>his man-servant</i> and <i>his maid-servant,</i> as I.E. believes Deut. 5:18. does. However, see above note 10.</i> It is impossible to rationally accept such things. Even more difficult than all of the things that I have mentioned above is that all the wonders which Moses performed have some parallel [in the world of our experience].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The miracles performed by Moses are based on natural law and thus have some parallel in nature.</i> This will be understood by the intelligent. Now, God’s saying <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> simultaneously is a wonder of wonders.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It has no parallel in the everyday world.</i> Such a wonder should have been clearly recorded in the Torah more than all the signs and wonders that are noted therein. Even if we maintain that God’s speech is unlike human speech,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">And God can say two things at the same time.</i> how did Israel understand what God was saying? For if a person hears, <i>Remember,</i> and <i>Observe</i> simultaneously, he understands neither the one nor the other. Even in the case of one word, namely, the word <i>zakhor</i> (remember),<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Spelled <i>zayin, kaf, resh.</i></i> if one does not hear the <i>zayin</i> enunciated before the <i>kaf</i> and the <i>resh</i> he will not understand what the speaker is saying. We clearly know that the eye perceives much better than the ear does, for we have indisputable proof that thunder sounds at the very moment that the lightning is seen. Now the eye perceives the lightning from a distance.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the eye sees the thunder instantaneously.</i> However, the sound is brought to the ear by the air. The sound travels slowly and does not reach the ear until a moment has passed. Now the forms of the letters that one enunciates are “written” in the air after the manner of the five organs which produce them.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">There are five types of letters: gutturals, palatal, dentals, linguals, and labials. The throat “writes” the gutturals in the air, the lips “write” their linguals in the air, and so on. This type of writing has its own manner, and it differs from the writing which the hand produces on paper.</i> They are not written in the manner of script, which is produced by the human hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is trying to explain why the eye can simultaneously see two words while the ear can only hear one word at a time. He thus explains that sound (words written in the ear) is different from script.</i> Now the entire letter <i>zayin</i> enters the ear before the <i>kaf,</i> the <i>vav,</i> and the <i>resh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>zakhor</i> (remember) is enunciated as if spelled <i>zayin, kaf, vav, resh.</i> In order for the word <i>zakhor</i> to be heard, one must hear, the <i>zayin, kaf, vav, resh</i> in succession. If one hears them at the same time, one does not know what is being said.</i> Even if we assume that <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> were miraculously uttered simultaneously, how was Israel able to understand what was being said? If we assume that the ear, which does not normally have the ability to hear two words at the time, was at that time miraculously able to hear two words at the same time, why didn’t the sages of blessed memory mention this? For this is a greater miracle than God’s uttering two words simultaneously.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The sages should have said that <i>Observe</i> and <i>Remember</i> were heard simultaneously rather than were said simultaneously.</i> Aside from this, what shall we do with the remaining questions relating to variant verses which, unlike <i>Observe</i> and <i>Remember,</i> do not have the same meaning? What are we to do with statements that appear in <i>Va-Etchannan</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the second chapter.</i> and do not appear in <i>Yitro</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the first chapter.</i> Also, how are we to harmonize <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14) with <i>Neither shalt thou covet they neighbor’s house</i> (Deut. 5:18)?<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See note 18.</i> How are we to explain the reversals?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That is, placing <i>his man-servant, nor his maid-servant,</i> before <i>his ox, nor his ass in yitro</i> (v. 14), while placing <i>his ox, or his ass</i> before <i>his man-servant, or his maid-servant.</i>, in <i>Va-Etchannan</i> (Deut. 5:18). However, see note 10.</i> I cannot explain the above to you<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">That is, I cannot answer the above questions.</i> until I first make clear to you the rules of the Hebrew tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the holy tongue.</i> Now God is my witness, He knows the deepest recesses of my mind. God knows that I would have remained silent if I did not have to explain the above difficulties.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is apologetic, for in explaining the discrepancies in the two version of the Ten Commandments he is, in effect, giving what to many was a radical interpretation of the formulation of the Torah. See below.</i> However, before I begin, I will explain the words of our sages of blessed memory.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">That is, explain what the sages meant when they said that <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> were uttered simultaneously.</i> 
Abraham the author declares: It is the style of those who speak Hebrew to express their thoughts very clearly at times. However, at other times it is their style to say what they must in as few words as is necessary for a person to understand their meaning. Note that words are like bodies and their meanings are like souls. The body is, as it were, a vessel for the soul. Hence all the wise men of all nations<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, tongues. In other words, all wise men who speak a different language.</i> are in the habit of preserving the ideas conveyed by a word<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. literally reads: The wise men…preserve meanings.</i> and are not concerned with changes in wording when the meaning remains one and the same. I will now offer you a number of examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Of instances in Scripture where the same idea is conveyed in different words.</i> God told Cain: <i>And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from the ground… When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth</i> (Gen. 4:11,12). Cain replied: <i>Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land</i> (Gen. 4:14). Now who is so simple as to think<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vat. Ebr. 38</i> reads: Now he who is simple thinks.</i> that the latter verse does not convey what the former verse does because of the change in words. Look, Eliezer said, <i>Give me to drink</i> (hagmi’ini), <i>I pray thee</i> (Gen. 24:17). However, he quoted himself as saying, <i>Let me drink</i> (hashkini), <i>I pray thee</i> (Gen. 24:45). Moses said, <i>the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon</i> (Ex. 12:29). However, it is earlier written, <i>the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill</i> (Ex. 11:5). In Deuteronomy, Moses quoted the prayer which he offered on behalf of Israel because of the golden calf (Deut. 9:26-29). Now to the unintelligent, this prayer appears totally different from the one recorded in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i> (Ex. 32:11-14). The general rule is, one will find the same meaning in different words whenever anything is repeated in Scripture, such as the dreams of Pharaoh<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 41:1-7; 17-24.</i> and Nebuchadnezzar,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Dan. 4.</i> and many other things. Now Scripture, as I noted, sometimes abridges and other times elaborates. It does the same with prefixes.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, servile letters.</i> At times it adds them. At other times it leaves them out. However, the meaning remains the same. Thus God said, <i>and blue</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>u-tekhelet.</i></i> <i>and purple</i> (Ex. 25:4). However, Moses said, <i>blue</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tekhelet.</i></i> <i>and purple</i> (Ex. 28:6). God said, <i>onyx stones</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>avne shoham.</i></i> (Ex. 25:7). However, Moses said, <i>and onyx stones</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-avne shoham.</i></i> (Ex. 35:9). There are many such instances. Either way is correct, as the verse which leaves out the <i>vav</i> is employing a concise style. There is no harm in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">For it does not change the basic meaning of the verse.</i> Similarly, the verse which has a <i>vav</i> in it does no harm because it adds clarity. Now one does not search for a reason that a <i>vav,</i> which is enunciated by the mouth,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the <i>vav</i> of <i>ve-avne,</i> or <i>u-tekhelet.</i></i> is sometimes left out, sometimes written, and sometimes added.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is a superfluous <i>vav.</i> See Vol. 1, Introduction, p. XVII.</i> For any of the aforementioned<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Ways of writing.</i> is correct. We do not look for the reason why an enunciated <i>vav</i> was written.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Or was left out.</i> This being the case, why should we look for reasons regarding<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The omission or non-omission of.</i> the silent <i>vav</i> which is not enunciated? For example, we should not ask why the word <i>le-olam</i> (forever)<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Olam</i> can be spelled with or without a <i>vav.</i></i> is written with or without a <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> in <i>olam</i> is silent.</i> Now people want reasons for full and also for deficient spellings. I would have kept silent if they wanted reasons for each one of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For every full or deficient spelling (Weiser).</i> or if there was only one way to spell these words.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">And they found it spelled otherwise.</i> I will give you an example. Suppose someone tells me, “Write the following to my friend: I so and so love you forever;” and I spelled <i>ploni</i> (so and so) without a <i>vav,</i> and also <i>ohevekha</i> (I love you) without a <i>vav</i> and <i>le-olam</i> (forever) deficiently.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">That is, without a <i>vav.</i></i> Then Reuben came to me and asked me why I wrote deficiently. Now my concern is to write what I was told to write. I am not concerned with full or deficient spellings.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">A person uses the spellings that come to mind. There is no hint of anything special or any allusion in the type of spelling that one chooses to employ.</i> Perhaps Levi will come along and teach me how to write.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">That is, when to use full or deficient spellings. Levi obviously cannot, for there are no rules regarding the use of full or deficient spellings.</i> I do not want to dwell on this. However, the intelligent will understand what I mean.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. apparently believed that Moses had some discretion in choosing the spelling to be employed in writing the Torah.</i> I will now explain the above-noted difficulties.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The questions raised by I.E. at the beginning of his comments on this verse.</i> 
Note that this chapter preserves the wording of the Ten Statements exactly as uttered by God, for Scripture states, <i>And God spoke all these words, saying</i> (v. 1). The statements open with <i>I am the Lord thy God,</i> and close with <i>nor any thing that is thy neighbor’s</i> (v. 14). Moses also noted, <i>These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire</i> (Deut. 5:19) when he mentioned the Ten Statements a second time. The Ten Statements have no break in them.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">God spoke all ten of them without pause. I.E. takes issue with those who held that only the first two statements were uttered by God.</i> Furthermore, the Lord uttered all of them exactly as they were written by the finger of God. One can refute the evidence<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">To the contrary.</i> from the third, fourth, and fifth statements, which are not in the first person,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">And thus seem to indicate that God did not utter them.</i> as follows: now that you have accepted the Lord as your God,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">As the first and second statements tell you to do.</i> <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</i> (v. 7).<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the reason the third statement is in the second person is that its meaning is: Now that you have accepted the Lord as your God, <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</i></i> Similarly <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</i> (v. 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">It is to be similarly interpreted. That is, its meaning is: for in six days the Lord, whom you accepted as your God, made heaven and earth. The fifth statement should be similarly interpreted.</i> It should also be noted that it is the style of those who speak Hebrew to speak in this manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">To start in the first person and then go on to use the third person.</i> Thus Scripture states, <i>neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning</i> (Ex. 23:18). This is then followed by <i>into the house of the Lord thy God</i> (Ex. 23:19). There are many such examples. Those who say that the first statement<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>I am the Lord thy God,</i> etc.</i> is not part of the Ten Statements differ in the following. Some say that <i>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</i> (v. 3) is the first statement, and <i>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</i> (v. 4) the second. However, this is incorrect, as both statements deal with one and the same thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they cannot be counted as two separate statements.</i> One (v. 3) deals with accepting another god in secret and the other (v. 4) openly.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Publicly and openly accepting another god.</i> One (v. 3) deals with belief and the other (v. 4) with action. Now in the statement <i>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy…thou, thy son…thy daughter,</i> openly or secretly is all in the one commandment (v. 8).<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the fourth statement has a number of sub-statements; however, it is all considered one statement. The same must apply to the prohibition against worshipping idols.</i> Others say that <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14) is the ninth statement, and <i>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) is the tenth.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">They count verse 3 and verse 4 as the first statement.</i> They offer as proof the fact that God said, <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> twice, for there are two types of coveting. One is active, like an act of thievery, as in <i>neither shall any man covet thy land</i> (Ex. 34:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The import of this verse is, no one will steal your land. According to this interpretation the first half of verse 14 deals with theft and the second part with desire.</i> Now if the latter dealt with coveting in one’s heart, then the Land of Israel would be a bad place.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">For people only covet that which is desirable. Thus to tell Israel that no one will covet their land is to tell Israel that their land will be undesirable.</i> The second type of coveting is with one’s heart. Hence Moses had to explain<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 5:18.</i> that its meaning is,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house.</i></i> thou shalt not desire.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that its meaning is also: thou shalt not desire (Krinsky).</i> However, this too<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Like the interpretation which lists verses 3 and 4 as two independent statements.</i> is nonsense. Why would God mention thievery only with regard to a house and not mention other things along with it?<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the other things listed in verse 14.</i> I will offer you proof from the very words of Moses that these commentators explained incorrectly. Look, God said, <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14). However, Moses said, <i>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s wife</i> (Deut. 5:18). In their opinion, the second <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> written in our chapter refers to coveting with one’s heart, and the first one deals with the theft of a house. If this is the case, then Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 5:18.</i> inverted the matter, for he used, <i>Neither shalt thou desire</i> with <i>thy neighbor’s house,</i> and <i>Thou shalt not covet,</i> which means thou shalt not steal, with <i>thy neighbor’s wife.</i> Their definitions are thus destroyed. The truth of the matter is that <i>I am the Lord thy God</i> is, as I will explain in its place, the first statement. 
I will now comment on <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe.</i> Note that the meaning, not the wording, is preserved.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever Scripture repeats an account or a dictum.</i> Thus our father Isaac said to Esau, <i>that my soul may bless thee before I die</i> (Gen. 27:4). However, Rebekah told Jacob that she heard Isaac say, <i>and bless thee before the Lord before my death</i> (Gen. 27:7). Now <i>lifne moti</i> (before I die) <i>(Ibid</i>.) means the same as <i>betrem amut</i> (before I die).<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The idea is the same although the words are different.</i> This being the case,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">That Scripture preserves meanings.</i> why did Rebekah add, <i>before the Lord</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">When Isaac did not say this.</i> The answer is that Rebekah knew that Isaac was a prophet of the Lord and that the blessing which he would pronounce would be prophetically uttered. Hence she said, <i>before the Lord</i> to Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">When paraphrasing to Jacob what Isaac had told Esau.</i> She was, as it were, explaining the meaning of the blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">She was telling Jacob that Isaac’s blessing would be prophetically uttered.</i> Moses acted in a similar fashion. The Ten Statements recorded in this chapter are God’s very words without any additions or subtractions, and they alone were inscribed on the tablets of the covenant. It is not as Saadiah says that <i>Remember</i> was on one side and <i>Observe</i> was on the second side.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah Gaon each tablet contained a different version of the Ten Statements. One tablet corresponded to the version of Exodus and one tablet corresponded to the version in Deuteronomy.</i> The Ten Statements recorded in the Torah portion <i>Va-Etchannan</i> are the words of Moses. The fact that the second version twice reads, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 5:14,15. According to I.E. the meaning of the aforementioned is, as the Lord thy God commanded thee in the Ten Statements, the reference being to the first version.</i> is positive proof that this is so.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">That the second version is Mosaic.</i> Note that memory is stored in the back of brain, which is in the head. The forms are there preserved. Now memory includes observance.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">If one does not remember, he cannot observe.</i> The meaning of <i>Remember</i> is that one should keep in mind every day of the week what day that happens to be.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Calendars were very rare in the ancient world.</i> The reason for all of this is that one will observe the seventh day and do no work on it. The reason for remembering is for observance.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Remembering the Sabbath thus facilitates its observance.</i> Thus when God said, <i>Remember,</i> all the people understood that its meaning was, <i>Observe.</i> Hence <i>Remember</i> and <i>Observe</i> were, as it were, said simultaneously. Moses [similarly] had no need to mention <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</i> (v. 11) in the second version<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Ten Statements.</i> because he had at first stated, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (Deut. 5:13). The latter clause is to be understood as if it read, <i>as the Lord thy God commended thee</i> in “your Torah,”<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that Ibn Ezra follows the opinion that the Torah was given piecemeal. Thus when Moses repeated the Torah, the Israelites had the first four books of the Torah in their hands.</i> in the commandment opening with <i>Remember</i> (v. 8) and closing with <i>and hallowed it</i> (v. 11). Now God commanded that man- and maid-servants rest on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10.</i> The Lord, however, did not give a reason for this.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">That is, no reason for this was given in the first version of the Decalogue.</i> Moses therefore explained the reason. Moses said the reason God commanded that servants should rest on the Sabbath is that a person should remember that, like the servant, he too was a slave in Egypt, and God redeemed him from there. Note that eight of the statements are entirely negative commandments and that <i>Honor thy father and thy mother</i><sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. has already noted that <i>I am the Lord thy God</i> is a positive commandment; hence two of the Ten Statements are positive commandments and eight are negative commandments.</i> is a positive commandment. The rational wisdom which God has implanted in man’s heart teaches us that we are obligated to repay with good the good that a person has done for us. Now a child comes into the world only because of his parents. They nurse him, they care for him, they raise him, they give him to drink, they feed him, and they dress him. One has to honor one’s parents because they are the cause of his living upon the face of the earth. Hence the reward for honoring one’s parents is <i>that thy days may be long upon the land</i> (v. 12). God commanded a person to honor his parents because God breathed a soul into him<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 2:7.</i> through his parents who prepared the body, for he who honors them honors God. Now Moses said, <i>Honor thy father and thy mother</i> (Deut. 5:16) and then added by way of explanation, <i>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>that thy days may be long.</i></i> As I will explain in my comments on the verse that opens with the words <i>Thou shalt not eat it</i> (Deut. 12:25), reward is given for the observance of the positive commandments and punishment is meted out for the violation of negative commandments. Moses thus said that one is obligated to honor one’s parents <i>that thy days may be long</i> (Deut. 5:16). The obligation to honor one’s parents is dictated by reason. In addition, one who honor’s his parents will receive a good reward, namely, <i>thy days will be long</i> because one listened to the voice of God who commanded us to honor them. Thus what was noted in the explanation of Rebekah’s words<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Namely, that when Rebekah quoted Isaac she interspersed explanatory comments.</i> also applies to what Moses said. I have already noted that the terms <i>onyx stones</i> and <i>and onyx stones</i> mean the same thing. <i>Thou shalt not commit adultery</i> (v. 13) and <i>Neither shalt thou commit adultery</i> (Deut. 5:17), and <i>ed sheker</i> (false witness) (v. 13) and <i>ed shav</i> (false witness) (Deut. 5:17), are similarly “children of one father.”<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they have one meaning.</i> <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> (v. 14) and <i>neither shalt thou desire</i> (Deut. 5:18) likewise come out of one womb.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">They have one meaning.</i> God said, <i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house</i> (v. 14) because intelligent people first acquire a house and then a wife, next a man-servant and a maid-servant, and then an ox and an ass to plow their fields. Our chapter lists these items in this order. However, Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 5:18.</i> listed them in another order, for young men first desire a woman, then a house. Now since Moses spoke of the house and the field, he next took note of the ox and the ass<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">See note 10.</i> because they are used in plowing one’s field. Moses next mentioned the man-servant and the maid-servant. At the very end Moses, like God, generalized and said, <i>or any thing that is thy neighbor’s</i> (Deut. 5:18). Scripture reads, <i>These words the Lord spoke</i> (Deut. 5:19), and not <i>all these words</i> (v. 1) as is first written, because God’s words are intermingled with Moses’ words.

Verse 2

THE FIRST STATEMENT: I AM THE LORD. Note that all of the commandments fall into one of the following two categories. One category consists of rational laws which God implanted into the minds of all intelligent human beings. There are many such commandments. The only one of the Ten Statements which does not fall into this category is the command to observe the Sabbath. Hence every intelligent human being of every nation and of every tongue assents to them, for they are implanted in the human mind by reason. There is nothing to add to them or to subtract from them. Abraham observed them along with additional precepts.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., Abraham observed all the rational commandments plus the ritual of circumcision. See I.E. on Gen. 26:5.</i> God gave the Torah only to rational human beings. He who is without reason has no Torah. The second category that the precepts fall into is that of “hidden commandments,” that is, commandments for which that the Torah does not reveal any reason. Far be it, far be it for one to even think that any of these commandments contradict reason. We must in all instances observe everything that God has commanded us, whether their secret has or has not been revealed to us. If we find that one of the commandments contradicts reason, then we should not take it at face value but must search for its meaning in the books of our wise men, of blessed memory, to find out whether it is a parable. If we do not find this recorded,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">If the sages do not say that this commandment is not to be taken literally.</i> then we must investigate and try to understand it with all of our strength. Perhaps we can explain it. If we cannot, then we must leave it as it is and admit that we do not know its meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">There is a rational reason for every commandment, according to I.E. This is also the opinion of Maimonides. See <i>The Guide of the Perplexed,</i> 3:23. Saadiah Gaon, on the other hand, held that the commandments are divided into two groups, rational and arational commandments. See chapter 3 of Saadiah’s <i>Book of Beliefs and Opinions.</i></i> <i>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart</i> (Deut. 10:16) is an example of the aforementioned. Now did God command us to sadistically murder people?<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Which would be to kill, if we took <i>circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart</i> at face value.</i> We know of a certainty that each one of the commandments that are not placed upon us by reason has a secret meaning to it, though it be hidden from us. The fact that in some instances Scripture gives the reason why they were commanded is proof of this. Thus Scripture tells us that the Sabbath is in memory of God’s creation of the world; and the festival of unleavened bread, <i>that thou mayest remember the day when thou earnest forth out of the land of Egypt</i> (Deut. 16:3). Scripture states, <i>Love ye therefore the stranger; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt</i> (Deut. 10:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">It is interesting to note that I.E. does not consider the love of the stranger to be a rational law.</i> Sowing with two kinds of seeds is prohibited, <i>lest the fullness of the seed…be forfeited</i> (Deut. 22:9). Scripture states, <i>Only he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">An Israelite king.</i> <i>shall not multiply horses so that he does not cause the people to return to Egypt</i> (Deut. 17:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> It similarly gives the reason why <i>Neither shall he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">An Israelite king.</i> <i>multiply wives to himself</i> (Deut. 17:17), namely, <i>that his heart turn not away</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). The latter is not an independent commandment as Rabbi Simeon ben Kayyara<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">An eighth-century Babylonian sage who codified Talmudic law in a work called the <i>Halakhot Gedolot.</i></i> states.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">But is rather the reason Scripture gives for the commandment, <i>Neither shall he multiply wives to himself.</i></i> Scripture similarly tells us the reason for <i>and he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">The king.</i> <i>shall read therein</i><sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">In the Torah.</i> (Deut. 17:19), namely, <i>that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren</i> (Deut. 17:20). We similarly find in the chapter dealing with the assembly,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Held every seven years for the public reading of the Torah.</i> <i>and that they may learn</i><sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this law.</i></i> (Deut. 31:12). This is the case with many commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah itself gives the reason for them.</i> Hence<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">That is, since there are reasons for the commandments.</i> every intelligent human being whose eyes have been opened by God can learn from the Torah the secret of all the commandments. There are three types of commandments, namely, commandments observed with one’s heart, commandments observed by speech, and commandments observed by acts. The commandments observed with the heart are of two sorts, namely, positive and negative commandments. The positive commandments include: <i>Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God</i> (Deut. 11:1); <i>and to cleave unto him</i> (Deut. 11:22); <i>that thou mayest fear this glorious and awful Name</i> (Deut. 28:58); <i>but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</i> (Lev. 19:18). The negative commandments include: <i>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart</i> (Lev. 19:17.); <i>Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge</i> (Lev. 19:18). The commandments observed by speech also consist of positive and negative commandments. Among the positive commandments are: reading the <i>shema,</i> saying grace after meals, uttering the priestly benedictions, and making a confession [declaration] when one brings tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 26:13-16.</i> There are many such commandments. Among the negative precepts<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Connected to speech.</i> we find: <i>Thou shalt not bear false witness</i> (v. 13); <i>Thou shalt not revile God</i> (Ex. 22:27), and <i>Thou shalt not curse the deaf</i> (Lev. 19:14). The positive commandments and negative commandments observed through actions are legion. There is no reason to mention them. The commandments incumbent on the heart are the most important and the most prominent of the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">This too is the opinion of Bachya ibn Pakuda in his <i>Duties of the Heart.</i></i> Many people think that with the exception of idol worship there are no sins connected to thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, thoughts of the heart.</i> The truth of the matter is that idol worship is worse than all the other mental sins put together. Can they<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Those who deny the concept of sinful thoughts.</i> not see that Scripture writes, <i>There are six things which the Lord hateth</i> (Prov. 6:16), and then goes on to say, <i>A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts</i> (Prov. 6:18). Scripture furthermore states: <i>thou didst well that was in thy heart</i> (II Chron. 6:8); <i>Do good, O Lord, unto the good, And to them that are upright in their hearts</i> (Ps. 125:4); <i>Let your heart therefore be whole with the Lord our God</i> (I Kings 8:61): <i>I the Lord search the heart</i> (Jer. 17:10); <i>but the Lord looketh on the heart</i> (I Sam. 16:7). Now the first statement<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Decalogue.</i> is the basis of the nine that follow it. Its place is among the precepts of the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, it is close to the commandments of the heart.</i> The first statement teaches that one should believe with an unwavering faith that this glorious God, whose name is written but not pronounced,<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YHVH</i> (the Lord).</i> is one’s only God. 
Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, who rests in glory, once asked me why God said, <i>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</i> rather than, I am the Lord thy God who made heaven and earth and created you? I answered the following. Know that people who believe in God the glorious are not on the same level of faith. Many believe what they have heard; that is, they believe because their masters have told them so. Above them are those who believe because of what they have read in the Torah, which God gave to Moses. Now they would place their hands upon their mouths<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">They would keep still.</i> if a heretic were to come along and argue that God does not exist, for they do not possess the means to answer. Now a person whose heart has moved him<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ex. 35:26.</i> to study the sciences, which are the steps that lead to the place of his desire,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">The perfection of the soul. According to I.E. the aforementioned is the purpose of all study. See chapter 1 of I.E.’s <i>Yesod Morah.</i></i> will see God’s work in the metals, in the plants and living creatures, and in the human body itself. He will know the makeup of each organ according to the scientific explanations of how each organ functions. He will similarly know the reason for each organ’s form. His heart will then aspire to learn the science of the spheres that are the Lord’s works in the middle world,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">For a description of the three worlds, see I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</i> which is everlasting. He will learn when the sun or moon is eclipsed. He will know how the moon causes the sun to be eclipsed. He will know why the moon is eclipsed and what causes its eclipses. He will know these things and be able to prove them beyond a shadow of a doubt. The intelligent person will come to know God by learning the ways of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">That is, by studying nature.</i> Moses similarly stated, <i>show me now Thy ways, that I may know Thee</i> (Ex. 33:13). Now God the revered proclaimed, I <i>am the Lord thy God</i> in His first statement.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">In the Decalogue.</i> Only one who is of great intellect can understand this.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that which follows.</i> I have already explained in the Torah portion, <i>Ve-Eleh Shemot</i> that God alone is everlasting without any change and that there is none aside from Him that exists forever, and none aside from Him is <i>enthroned of old, Selah,</i> (Ps. 55:20). God alone maintains the uppermost world<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">See note 134.</i> by His power. The middle world is maintained by God’s power and by His holy angels, who are of the uppermost world. Ours, the lowest of the worlds, is maintained by God’s power plus the power of the two higher worlds. Now the statement <i>I am the Lord</i> is sufficient for the intelligent of any nation.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">It is sufficient for a non-Jew to believe that God exists. He does not have to believe that God created the world.</i> But only Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>yisra’el</i> as in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 rather than <i>ve-yisra’el</i> as in the printed texts.</i> believes that the sky and earth were made close to five thousand years ago. The nations of the world do not deny that God alone made sky and earth. They differ only in that they maintain that God continuously creates without beginning or end.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">They maintain that the world is eternal. It was never created and will never end (Krinsky). This is the opinion of Aristotle, who held that God and the world co-exist.</i> Now the Lord performed signs and wonders in Egypt until Moses brought them out of there so that He would be their God. Moses similarly said, <i>Or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation</i> (Deut. 4:34). The meaning of the latter is that God did for Israel what He did not do for any other nation. God created the middle world.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">The world of the spheres, stars, and planets.</i> He rules over the lowest of the worlds.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The earth.</i> Good or bad befalls every nation according to the arrangement of its star, for this is what God has apportioned to them. Now Israel was destined to continue in slavery according to the stars of its constellation. However, because of God’s love of the patriarchs, the Lord used His power to bring forth signs in the lowest world which were not decreed by the powers of the middle world. God removed Israel from the rule of the constellations and made them the people of His very own inheritance. It is because of this that the ancients say, “Israel has no star.”<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sabbath</i> 156a; <i>Nedarim</i> 32a.</i> I will yet explain this via parables in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa.</i> It was because of the signs that God performed in Egypt that Moses said, <i>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him</i> (Deut. 4:35). Everyone, learnèd and nonlearnèd, adults and children, witnessed this. When recounting the events at the assembly at Sinai,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">In the following verse.</i> Moses added that Israel heard God’s voice. Thus, following the latter, Moses said, <i>Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice, that He might instruct thee</i> (Deut. 4:36). At the very end<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Of his discourse.</i> Moses said that ultimate knowledge consists in the development of one’s mind to the point where one is able to prove to himself that the Lord alone is God.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him</i> (Deut. 4:35).</i> Scripture therefore states, <i>know this day, and lay it to thy heart, that the Lord, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else</i> (Deut. 4:39). David similarly said, <i>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve Him</i> (I Chron. 28:9). Knowledge is in the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">That is, being convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt.</i> It does not refer to confession with one’s lips.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">It does not refer to mere confession of faith.</i> Now it is for the intelligent that God said, <i>I am the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">For the intelligent person can prove God’s existence philosophically.</i> He added, <i>who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</i> (v. 2) so that the intelligent and the non-intelligent<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">The non-intelligent person has to be shown tangible proof of God’s existence. I.E. here takes issue with a contemporary, Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, who felt that philosophical proof of God’s existence is insufficient for a truly spiritual life. See Book 1 of the <i>Kuzari.</i></i> would understand. God added, <i>thy God,</i> meaning, you are obligated to serve me, that is, to be My servant and to be My people, and I will be your God, because <i>I…brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). The aforementioned was explained by Moses in the chapter that opens with the words <i>When thy son asketh</i> (Deut. 6:20.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which the Lord our God hath commanded you?</i></i> The meaning of the question<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">The son’s question.</i> is: why are we, more than any other nation, obligated to observe God’s commandments? Have we not all one creator?<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">See Malachi 2:10.</i> Moses gave three answers.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">To the son’s question.</i> The first one is, <i>We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt</i> (Deut. 6:21) and God did all these good things<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Which are recorded in Deut. 6:21-23.</i> for us. We are therefore obligated, even if we do not know the reason for His commandments, to observe everything that God commands us to do. The second one is, God did not decree the commandments to us because of His own needs but rather <i>for our good always</i> (Deut. 6:24). The third is, <i>And it shall be righteousness unto us;</i> that is, we will be righteous people and thus merit the world to come <i>if we observe to do all this commandment before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us</i> (Deut. 6:25). The philosophers have discovered that there are ten aspects relating to that which is corporeal.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">The ten Aristotelian predicates. They are: Essence, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Position, State, Activity, Passivity. See page 37 in <i>Essays in Logic; From Aristotle to Russell,</i> selected and edited by Ronald Jager, Prentis Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1963.</i> They are primary categories. There is nothing above them. The first pertains to a thing’s essence. It is everlasting. The other nine are accidents. They depend on the first, are joined to it, and result from it. The first is like the number one in the number ten, for the entire sum<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">That is, 10.</i> came out of number one and all sums are found in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">All sums are made out of the number one.</i> One is the foundation.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Of all numbers.</i> Now the first statement uttered by God the glorious includes all precepts directed at the heart, tongue, and human deeds. For one who does not believe in his heart that God exists has no commandments upon him. A person is obligated to mention God’s name every moment, to honor Him. Everything a person does,<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is apparently to the observance of the positive commandments.</i> he must do only for the glory of God. A person should<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly.</i> not keep from violating a negative precept except out of regard for God’s glory. For example, a man who gives charity to the poor should not give it out of respect for the collector, nor so that people should praise him. For if this is the case, then a human being’s status is more important in his eyes than the glory of God, who gave him wealth and abundance of money from which he can give charity and receive a reward from God. The same applies to one who trespasses in secret so that<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">He thinks.</i> his sin will not become known to the king, or people see him and come to consider him a shameful person. One who thinks thus<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to God.</i> is insane, for it is written, <i>He that planted the ear, shall He not hear</i> (Ps. 94:9). Now God sees the hidden things. He sees what people cannot openly see. God knows each one’s thoughts and his secrets. Now a person is afraid of the king<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">And hence does not publicly violate his laws.</i> who will die on the next day and not punish him, and does not fear the True King in whose hands is his soul in this world and in the next world. 
The Gaon, Rabbi Saadiah composed <i>azharot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Liturgical poems devoted to the enumeration of 613 commandments. The name is derived from the initial word of the first composition of this nature, viz., <i>Exhortations</i> (azharot) <i>didst Thou give to Thy people of old. Azharot</i> is numerically equivalent to 613 (Roth, <i>Standard Jewish Encyclopedia</i>). See <i>Taryag</i> by Abraham Hirsch Rabinowitz, Boys Town Jerusalem Publishing, Jerusalem, 1967, pp. 41-60.</i> He encompassed all the commandments<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah.</i> in these Ten Statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah was the first to do so (Rabinowitz). According to Saadiah the first statement takes in 80 precepts, the second 60, the third 48, the fourth 78, the fifth 77, the sixth 50, the seventh 88, the eighth 52, the ninth 52, and the tenth 54.</i> We find<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. The printed editions read: and they found.</i> God’s name<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YHVH.</i></i> in the first five statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">But not in the last five. I.E. will soon go on to explain why.</i> I have already explained that the first statement is the foundation upon which all the commandments rest. It is followed by <i>Thou shalt have no other gods.</i> The sin of the one who does not believe in God is greater than the sin of the one who worships idols. For there are many who believe in the Lord and offer sacrifices to idols, like those who offered to the queen of heaven, because they think that it can help them. As the verse says, <i>But since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things</i> (Jer. 44:18). Scripture also reads, <i>They feared the Lord, and served their own gods</i> (II Kings 17:33). We find the same with Naaman who said, <i>when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Rimmon was a pagan god.</i> <i>the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing</i> (II Kings 5:18). Now all of the above-mentioned believe in the Lord. However, they join another with Him. It is for this reason that the name of the revered God is written in this statement.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">For only <i>YHVH</i> may be worshipped.</i> God’s name is also written in the third statement, for swearing falsely is less of a sin than idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is mentioned in the third statement rather than in the second.</i> Nevertheless, one who does this publicly shames the Lord. It is possible that the violator acts in this manner out of anger or need, for he believes in his heart in God and does not worship any deity along with the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the violator is not considered an atheist and does not fall under the purview of the first statement. I.E. comments thus because one might assume that a person who swears falsely and invokes God’s name does not believe in the Lord.</i> The fourth statement tells us that the Lord<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the use of the name <i>YHVH.</i></i> rested on the seventh day. Thus he who does work on the Sabbath denies that God created the world. Now this sin is less severe than taking the name of the Lord in vain. The Lord’s name is written in the fifth statement because parents are God’s partners in the creation of a human being. If a person does not honor his parents, it is as if he is not honoring God. The five remaining statements deal with sins against a fellow human being.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Hence God’s name is not mentioned there.</i> The first one is the most heinous, namely, causing the soul to separate from the body. This is followed by the rape of the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 and the parallel in I.E.’s short commentary. The printed editions read: this is followed by “not (<i>enam</i>) in the body.” <i>Enam</i> is obviously an error for <i>ones</i> (rape). I.E. interprets <i>lo tinaf</i> (thou shalt not commit adultery) as thou shalt not rape, because it is positioned between thou shalt not murder and thou shalt not steal, both of which are acts of violence. In the short commentary he interprets <i>lo tinaf</i> thus: do not take by force what belongs to someone else, i.e., someone’s wife; do not take by force that which is independent, i.e., an unmarried women, or that which is not human; i.e., do not practice bestiality.</i> Next comes, Thou shalt not steal money. Afterwards comes stealing with the tongue. Next comes coveting with one’s heart.

Verse 3

THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS. Scripture speaks from the point of view of the idol worshipper.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture speaks of other gods only from the point of view of their worshippers, as there is no God other than the Lord.</i> It is similar to <i>Then Hananiah the prophet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Hananiah was a false prophet; that is, he was not a prophet. Scripture thus speaks from the point of view of those who considered him a prophet.</i> <i>took</i> (Jer. 28:10); and, <i>And the men pursued after them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">In reality they did not. They only thought that they were pursuing them.</i> (Josh. 2:7). Samuel’s statement, <i>Why hast thou disquieted me</i> (I Sam. 28:15) is similar, for Scripture speaks from Saul’s point of view.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Saul thought that it was really Samuel speaking. However, in reality it was not. See Rabbi David Kimchi’s commentary on I Sam. 28:15.</i> This is not the place to explain it.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">How Saul was tricked.</i>
[BEFORE ME.]<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, before My face. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Its meaning is like that of <i>And Haran died before the face of his father</i><sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">J.P.S., <i>in the presence of.</i></i> <i>Terah</i> (Gen. 11:28), which means that Terah was with Haran and saw him die. Similarly, <i>and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office before the face of Aaron their father</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Num. 3:4). The meaning of our verse thus is, it is unseemly for you to worship any other god along with Me since I am your God and am always with you and see what you do. One of the wise men once said, “Do not anger your master when he sees you.” Now this commandment, namely, <i>Thou shalt have no other gods</i> is directed to the heart and to the mouth, for aside from this precept there is no other negative commandment in the Torah directed to the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Actually there are, such as <i>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart…Thou shalt not…bear any grudge</i> (Lev. 19:17,18). What I.E. probably meant was, there is no negative commandment directed at the heart i n the Torah for the violation of which one is punished by a court with death or stripes, with the exception of <i>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</i></i> If a man says in the presence of witnesses that he intends to murder or commit adultery, he will not be executed for what he said as long as he does not commit any act. However, Scripture states concerning anyone who says, <i>Let us go and serve other gods</i> (Deut. 13:7), <i>but thou shalt surely kill him</i> (Deut. 13:10). On the other hand, the statement <i>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</i> (v. 4) deals with an act. It prohibits the making of a graven image out of wood or stone. It prohibits making any manner of likeness of anything that is in the heavens by any sort of means. Scripture uses the term <i>above</i> because the heavens are above the earth on all sides. There are no likenesses in the heavens except for the forty-eight forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Forty-eight groupings of stars, such as the lion, the bear, etc.</i> Those who are wise about the forms do things that are wrong.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">They act incorrectly. They make images on earth in duplication of the heavenly bodies, hoping to make the powers of the heavenly bodies enter their images for purposes of magic and foretelling of the future. See I.E. on Gen. 31:19 and Ex. 14:2.</i> What they do is very close to idolatry.

Verse 4

OR THAT IS THE EARTH BENEATH. There are many likenesses in the earth which is beneath the heavens<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>beneath</i> means beneath the heavens.</i> and also in the water, as is explained in the Torah portion <i>Ve-Etchannan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 4:16-19, i.e., likenesses of male or female, any beast, winged fowl, fish, etc.</i> Scripture reads, <i>the water under the earth</i> because the sea and the earth are part of one globe.

Verse 5

THOU SHALT NOT BOW DOWN UNTO THEM. As do the masters of the forms,<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">See the latter parts of I.E.’s comments on verse 3 and the notes thereto.</i> who think that they can cause upper powers to descend for the needs of a given person.
NOR SERVE THEM. <i>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</i> includes sacrificing and offering to the gods. It also includes the prohibition <i>and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth</i> (Ex. 23:13) and the book of Joshua’s statement <i>nor cause</i><sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Anyone.</i> <i>to swear by them</i> (Josh. 23:7).
[A JEALOUS GOD.] What God demands is only logical,<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">A jealous God means a God who demands that you act correctly.</i> for how can you give the honor due to the Lord who created you and sustains your life to another who can neither harm nor aid.<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Hence I the Lord who am a jealous God will punish you.</i> Scripture employs the term <i>el</i> (god) to inform us that the Lord is mighty and can exact vengeance at any moment from the idol worshipper without the sinner being able to save himself. Jeremiah said, <i>every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge</i> (Jer. 31:30). The book of Ezekiel clearly states that God the revered swore that <i>the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father</i> (Ezek. 18:20). This being the case, what does Scripture mean by <i>visiting the iniquities of the father upon the children</i>? The answer is that which Ezekiel clearly states. If a father was wicked and his son did not follow in his footsteps, then the son does not bear the iniquity of the father.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 18:14-17.</i> For <i>visiting the iniquities</i><sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Of the fathers upon the children.</i> is, as I have noted, connected to God’s enemies.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, only if the son is also wicked. This is also the opinion of the Talmud, <i>San.</i> 27b.</i> <i>Poked</i> (visiting) has the same meaning as <i>zokher</i> (remembering).<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>poked avon avot</i> (visiting the iniquities of the fathers) means remembering the sins of the fathers.</i> Compare, <i>And the Lord visited</i> (pakad) <i>Sarah</i> (Gen. 21:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> which is another way of saying, and the Lord remembered (<i>va-yizkor</i>) Sarah. God is patient with the wicked because it is possible that he will repent and bear a son who is better than he. Now if the son walks in the footsteps of his father and so do the third and fourth generations, then God will not be patient and withhold his anger from the fourth generation. If all of them until four generations are enemies of God, then they will all perish in the fourth generation. For God will remember what the father did, what the son did, and what the grandson did. Hence he will not keep his anger in check when it comes to the fourth generation. Grandchildren are considered as children.<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>upon the children</i> is short for upon the children and upon the grandchildren. See Ex. 34:7.</i> Hence Scripture employed a shortened form. One can understand this<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">That God visits the sins of the fathers upon grandchildren.</i> from the terms <i>the third and fourth generation</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">If God visits the sins of the fathers upon the third and fourth generation, He certainly does so on the second generation.</i>

Verse 6

AND SHOWING MERCY UNTO THE THOUSANDTH GENERATION.<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and showing mercy unto thousands (of generations). Hence I.E.’s comments.</i> Scripture elsewhere reads, <i>to a thousand generations</i> (Deut. 7:9). Some people think this represents a problem.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture here promises that God will show mercy unto thousands of generations, whereas in Deuteronomy He promises to show mercy <i>to a thousand generations.</i></i> However, it does not, for Scripture reads as follows: if you will observe My commandments then God will keep the covenant and the mercy which He swore unto your ancestors, that is, to the three patriarchs.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">To a thousand generations.</i> This is the meaning of <i>who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations</i> (Deut. 7:9). However this chapter deals with another matter. Scripture here states, <i>and showing mercy to thousands</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Of generations.</i> Its meaning is, without end, namely, forever. This can be explained in two ways. One, God shows mercy to those who love Him by granting everlasting existence to their souls so that they remain alive for thousands upon thousands of years. Two, that God will eternally show mercy to their offspring who are like them. David similarly said, <i>But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, And His righteousness unto children’s children</i> (Ps. 103:17). Now there is no doubt that God’s mercy is eternally upon those who fear Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">What need then is there for Scripture to state, <i>of them that love Me and keep My commandments?</i></i> It is only because Scripture mentions the children’s children,<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">They are alluded to in <i>unto the thousandth generation.</i></i> in keeping with <i>And His righteousness endureth for ever</i> (Ps. 111:3), that Scripture has to explain that this only applies if the children are good. Scripture therefore says that this is so only in regard to those who keep God’s covenant. When I comment upon the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa,</i> I will explain to you why the attribute of visiting the sins of the fathers is to be counted among the attributes of mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 34:7.</i>
[THEM THAT LOVE ME.] The reference is to the pious.<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>chasidim.</i></i> [AND KEEP MY COMMANDS.] The reference is to the righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tzadikim.</i></i>

Verse 7

THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN. The word <i>shem</i> (name) has the same meaning as the word <i>zekher</i> (memory). It serves as a sign of the one who is so called.<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, a proper name calls forth a specific person.</i> However, the term <i>zekher</i> is employed in Hebrew at times when someone is recalled in memory, and at times when someone is recalled in speech, whereas names are only used with reference to the latter. We thus find David saying, <i>Nor take their names upon my lips</i> (Ps. 16:4). Now when a person mentions God’s name<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">When taking an oath.</i> he is saying, as God is True so is what I will say true. Thus if he does not keep his word, he is, as it were, denying God. It is still the custom in Egypt for one to incur the death penalty if he swears by the head of the king and does not keep his word. The culprit is not spared even if he gives his ransom in gold because he publicly insulted the king. If this is the case with regard to a king of flesh and blood, how many thousands of times more does one have to be careful that one’s mouth does not cause his tongue to stumble and bring his flesh into guilt by mentioning God’s name in vain.<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Eccles. 5:5.</i> Now Scripture tells us that Israel publicly took an oath because of the incident involving the concubine at Gibeah. We find that those who violated the oath were put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">See Judges 19-21.</i> It should be noted that Phineas the priest was there.<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 20:18. The point is that Phineas could not find an out for the people who violated the oath.</i> Similarly with the people of Jabesh-gilead, men, women, and children.<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">They were all put to death because the above-noted oath was violated.</i> Even those who desecrate the Sabbath are not dealt with in this manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">The families of Sabbath violators are not punished.</i> We also read that Saul wanted to kill his son Jonathan for desecrating an oath that Jonathan was not even aware of.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">See I Sam. 14:24-45.</i> Scripture also tells us<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, we also see.</i> that God brought a famine upon the land because Saul and his house violated the oath taken by the leaders of Israel which they swore unto the Gibeonites.<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">See II Sam. 21:1 and Josh. 9:15.</i> We are told that when the house of blood was put to death, God was entreated for the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of II Sam. 21:14.</i> Solomon similarly said to Shimei, <i>Did I not make thee to swear by the Lord</i> (I Kings 2:42).<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Solomon put Shimei to death for violating an oath.</i> The sum of the matter is that with the exception of honoring one’s parents,<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the reward that is promised for honoring one’s parents.</i> we do not find the reward for observing a commandment clearly spelled out in any of the Ten Statements. We similarly do not find the punishment for violating a commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">That is, one of the Ten Commandments.</i> spelled out except for idolatry and taking God’s name in vain. Many think that a person who takes the name of the Lord in vain does not commit a great sin. I will show that in reality it is more severe than any of the other prohibitions which follow. For a murderer cannot commit murder, nor an adulterer adultery, both of which are major sins, whenever they want to because they are afraid of being caught. However, the person who is the habit of swearing falsely will daily utter innumerable vows. Such a person is so accustomed to committing this sin that he is not even aware that he is taking an oath. Should someone chide him and say to him, “Why are you swearing?” he responds by swearing that he did not swear, because he is so habituated to swearing. For he prefaces anything he says by saying, “I swear.” They<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">Those who constantly swear.</i> think that this is an elegant way to speak.<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">To preface everything they say with “I swear.”</i> If Israel was guilty only of this sin it would be cause enough to prolong the exile and add blows to our blows. I will now demonstrate their madness. For a murderer who kills his enemy satisfies his impulses by exacting vengeance. Similarly the adulterer for the moment. Likewise the thief who finds pleasures for his needs, and the false witness who does so to gain favor or revenge. Now the one who is constantly swearing, although there is no need for him to do so publicly, desecrates the name of God without deriving any benefit from his act.

Verse 8

REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY TO KEEP IT HOLY. The meaning of <i>to keep it holy</i> is explained by what follows, namely, <i>Six days shalt thou labor.</i> Scripture similarly explains the meaning of <i>and hallowed it</i> (v. 11) by going on to say that God rested on the seventh day from all of His work. The reason the sanctification of the Sabbath is here connected to <i>the Lord blessed</i> [<i>the sabbath day</i>], as it is in the chapter opening with the words <i>were finished</i> (Gen. 2:1), is that God sanctified this day and prepared it so that the souls<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Of those who observe the Sabbath.</i> would receive an infusion of wisdom above that of the other days. That is why Scripture states <i>the Lord blessed</i> [<i>the sabbath day</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. a blessing means that something good should be increased. See I.E. on Gen. 2:3 and the notes thereto.</i> I have already explained this in my comments <i>on A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ps. 92:50.</i> We have seen<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">In Scripture.</i> that the sabbatical year is similar to the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 25:4.</i> It too is a seventh, that is, it falls every seven years. God commanded that the Torah be read at the beginning of the year<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the reference is to the beginning of the Sabbatical year.</i> in the presence of the men, women, and little ones. The reason for this is <i>that they may hear, and that they may learn…and observe to do all the words of this law</i> (Deut. 31:12). Now the Sabbath was given<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">As a day to be set aside from the other days of the week.</i> for understanding the works of God and the study of His Torah. Scripture thus states,<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">In the psalm dedicated to and chanted on the Sabbath.</i> <i>For Thou, Lord, hast me glad through Thy work</i> (Ps. 92:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">Which, according to I.E., means that the study of God’s work gladdens the heart.</i> A person is occupied with his needs all the days of the week. However, it is only right that he separate himself on the Sabbath and rest for the sake of God’s glory. He should not occupy himself with vanity by spending his time seeking advice, even if it concerns his past needs. He should similarly not seek counsel about what he should do in the future. The prophet similarly said, <i>Nor pursuing thy business,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">On the Sabbath.</i> <i>nor speaking thereof</i> (Is. 58:13). It was customary for the Israelites to travel before the onset of the Sabbath to where the prophets lived, as indicated in <i>Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath</i> (II Kings 4:23). I have<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">In his comment on verse 1.</i> already noted that whosoever does any work on the Sabbath is in essence denying creation. However, such an individual does not deny the existence of God the revered.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the prohibition to violate the Sabbath is not subsumed in the first of the Ten Statements.</i> There can be no doubt that the word <i>thou</i> includes all those who are obligated to observe the commandments. Hence <i>nor thy son, nor thy daughter</i> (v. 10) refers to small children for whose rest their father is responsible. Scripture tells us that we are obligated to guard them<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">On the Sabbath.</i> lest they do anything on the Sabbath that we are prohibited from doing. The same applies to <i>nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant</i> who is in our power. We our obligated to guard him and not allow him to do any work for another party; otherwise, we violate a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Namely, <i>thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou…nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant</i> (v. 10).</i> so <i>that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou</i> (Deut. 5:14). This was explained by Moses our master in the way we have noted.<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">That in repeating the Ten Statements, Moses inserted comments.</i> It is only on this condition that the stranger may dwell in our gates, namely, that the stranger does not do any work on the Sabbath and on Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Which is referred to as a Sabbath in Lev. 23:32.</i> Hence the stranger is also mentioned in the second version.<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Ten Statements in Deut. 5:14.</i> It is the same case with the sexual prohibitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in Lev. 18.</i> The stranger may dwell among us only if he observes the sexual prohibitions. Likewise with regard to eating blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 17:10.</i> When reading the Book of Jeremiah we noticed that the prophet was very strict about the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">The prophet threatens Jerusalem with destruction for violating the Sabbath.</i> The prophet explicitly stated that if Israel returns to Sabbath observance and keeps the Sabbath as they were commanded to, then even though the decree that Jerusalem be destroyed was issued, they would not be exiled from their place, and the thrones of the Davidic dynasty would remain standing in Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of Jer. 17:25.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER, AS THE LORD THY GOD COMMANDED THEE. I have already noted that the Lord’s name is mentioned in the first five statements. In all of these statements we find the form, <i>the Lord thy God.</i>
[THAT THY DAYS MAY BE LONG.] The word <i>ya’arikhun</i> (may be long) is a transitive verb. Its meaning is that one’s parents will be the cause of one’s days being long.<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ya’arikhun</i> (may be long) is to be rendered, they (your parents) will lengthen.</i> The term <i>ta’arikhu</i> (ye may prolong) in <i>and that ye may prolong your days</i> (Deut. 11:9) and <i>ve-ha’arakhta</i> (that thou mayest prolong) in <i>and that thou mayest prolong thy days</i> (Deut. 22:7) are proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta’arikhu</i> and <i>ve-ha’arakhta</i> are transitive. Similarly, <i>ya’arikhun.</i></i> You will find that because of the commandment which you observe, you lengthen your days.<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">For you will be rewarded with length of years for observing God’s laws.</i>
[UPON THE LAND.] Scripture reads, <i>upon the land</i> because if Israel observes this commandment they will not be exiled from the land. The prophet Ezekiel similarly states, <i>In thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem.</i> <i>have they made light of father and mother</i> (Ezek. 22:7). The commandment <i>Honor thy father and thy mother</i> means that we should not do the opposite; that is, we should not curse or make light of our parents. Now one who curses his parents incurs the death penalty because people hear the curse come out of his mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 21:17.</i> However, this penalty does not apply to one who disrespects his parents, for one can do so in secret. Therefore the one who is disrespectful to his parents falls under a curse like all those who are listed as cursed,<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 27:15-26.</i> for their deeds were done in secret.

Verse 13

THOU SHALT NOT MURDER. With your hand or your tongue, that is, by giving false testimony which results in having someone executed, or by tale bearing,<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">Which results in someone’s death.</i> or by wickedly giving someone counsel which you know will result in his death, or by not revealing a secret which you are aware of, to someone who would be saved if he knew what you know. If you do not reveal the secret you are a murderer.
THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY. Many think that the term <i>ni’uf</i> (adultery) only applies to adultery<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">With a married woman. This is the opinion of Rashi.</i> because they found Scripture stating, <i>asher yinaf et eshet re’ehu</i> (even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife) (Lev. 20:10). What reason is there to state this, having just said, <i>asher yinaf eshet ish</i> (that committeth adultery with another man’s wife)?<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">It is redundant. Hence we must assume that Scripture is explaining that the <i>ni’uf</i> spoken of in the first part of the verse can only be committed with a married woman. In other words, <i>asher yinaf et eshet re’ehu</i> (even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife) explains the term <i>yinaf</i> in <i>asher yinaf eshet ish</i> (that committeth adultery with another man’s wife).</i> However, its meaning is not as they think.<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">For the term <i>ni’uf</i> applies to all prohibited sexual acts.</i> Now the previous verse reads, <i>For whatsoever man there be that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him</i> (Lev. 20:9). Its meaning is,<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>he hath cursed his father or his mother.</i></i> he committed a great sin in cursing his parents who bore him. The same is true <i>even of he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife,</i> whom<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the neighbor. Scripture repeats to emphasize the sin; i.e., he has committed a great sin in sleeping with the wife of a person whom he is commanded to love as himself.</i> he is obligated to love as himself. The word <i>ni’uf</i> refers to an illicit sexual act. Behold, we find that Scripture states, <i>va-tinaf et ha-even ve-et ha-etz</i> (and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks) (Jer. 3:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">One cannot commit adultery with stones. Hence the meaning of <i>va-tinaf</i> (and she committed adultery) must be rendered: and she committed illicit sexual acts. For other interpretations see Weiser and Krinsky.</i> However, it is unfit to discuss this abomination publicly.<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">The type of sexual acts committed with stones and stocks.</i> Saadiah Gaon says that there are many levels of illicit sexual acts. The least illicit level is sleeping with a virgin or widow.<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">That is, an unmarried woman.</i> Next comes sleeping with one’s wife during her menstrual cycle, for she will be permitted to him in a few days. Then comes sleeping with someone else’s wife, for it is possible that her husband will die and she will be permitted to him. Next comes sleeping with a Canaanite woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">By Canaanite woman I.E. means a non-Jewish woman.</i> who does not follow Israelite law, without giving her seed, for it is possible that she will convert and he can then marry her. However, if he gives her seed then it is as if he himself is worshipping idols. Next comes sleeping with a male, which can never be permitted. Next comes bestiality, that is, intercourse with a nonhuman. The Gaon knew how to classify the various types of illicit intercourse,<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">This appears to be a sarcastic statement. In Lev. 18:21, I.E. says that Saadiah’s classification of the prohibited sexual acts is a waste of time. However, in his short commentary on Exodus, I.E. writes that Saadiah’s classification is close to the truth.</i> for Scripture decrees the penalty of <i>karet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Excision.</i> for all of the illicit sexual acts listed in the Torah portion <i>Achare Mot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 18:29. In other words, the Torah does not distinguish among them.</i> Saadiah omitted intercourse with one’s mother, sister, and daughter from his list of different levels of illicit sexual acts.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that Saadiah’s classification is far from perfect.</i>
THOU SHALT NOT STEAL. Stealing implies taking money secretly. There are thieves who incur the death penalty, namely, those who kidnap an Israelite, be he a child or one who cannot speak clearly.<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">An adult who cannot speak clearly and thus complain to others that he has been kidnapped.</i> The prohibition to steal money applies both to when the owner is present and to when he is not present. It also applies to cheating in number, measure, and weight. The term stealing also applies to what Absalom did,<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">Deception. See II Sam. 15:6.</i> that is, it prohibits deceiving another person.
THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS. For many years I asked myself why Scripture employs the phrase <i>ed sheker</i> (false witness) and not <i>edut sheker</i> (false testimony). I now believe that Scripture is addressing the false witness, and our verse is to be interpreted as if it read, “Thou shalt not give testimony if thou art a false witness.” The implication of this clause is the same as that of <i>neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another</i> (Lev. 19:11). We find that a <i>bet</i> follows the word for testimony in <i>and hath testified</i> (anah) <i>falsely against his brother</i> (be-achiv) (Deut. 19:18). We also find this verb employed without a <i>bet</i> following it in <i>yishma El ve-ya’anem</i> (God shall hear, and testify against them) (Ps. 55:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> Now <i>ve-ya’anem</i> is a compound of <i>ve-ya’aneh</i> (and shall testify) and <i>bam</i> (against them).<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">In effect, a <i>bet</i> follows “to testify,” for the <i>mem</i> suffix stands for the word <i>bam</i>.</i> The phrase <i>lo nega’anukha</i> (not touched thee) in <i>as we have not touched thee</i> (Gen. 26:29) is similar, as the meaning of <i>lo nega’anukha</i> is <i>lo naganu bakh</i> (we have not touched thee).<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>kaf</i> suffix stands for the word <i>bakh.</i> Thus in both cases the suffix stands for a <i>bet.</i></i> There is a type of false witness who incurs the death penalty, namely, the one concerning whom it is written, <i>then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother</i> (Deut. 19:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">If the false testimony would have resulted in an innocent person’s execution, then the false witness is put to death.</i>

Verse 14

THOU SHALT NOT COVET. Many people are amazed at this commandment. They ask, how is it possible for a person not to covet in his heart all beautiful things that appear desirable to him? I will now give you a parable.<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">Which will aid you in understanding the commandment that prohibits coveting.</i> Note, a peasant of sound mind who sees a beautiful princess will not entertain any covetous thoughts about sleeping with her, for he knows that this is an impossibility. This peasant will not think like the insane who desire to sprout wings and fly to the sky, for it is impossible to do so. Now just as a man does not desire to sleep with his mother, although she be beautiful, because he has been trained from his childhood to know that she is prohibited to him, so must every intelligent person know that a person does not acquire a beautiful woman or money because of his intelligence or wisdom, but only in accordance with what God has apportioned to him. Indeed, Koheleth states, <i>yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion</i> (Eccles. 2:21). Furthermore, our sages taught, children, life, and sustenance are not dependent upon a person’s merits but upon the stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 28a.</i> The intelligent person will therefore neither desire nor covet. Once he knows that God has prohibited his neighbor’s wife to him she will be more exalted in his eyes than the princess is in the eyes of the peasant. He will therefore be happy with his lot and will not allow his heart to covet and desire anything which is not his. For he knows that that which God did not want to give him, he cannot acquire by his own strength, thoughts, or schemes. He will therefore trust in his creator, that is, that his creator will sustain him and do what is right in His sight. Observe, we have completed explaining the Ten Statements. One of the wise men of this generation said: We know that nine spheres<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 3:15 and the notes thereto.</i> correspond to the nine numbers<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">From 2 to 10.</i> that are the basis of all numbers.<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 3:15 and the notes thereto.</i> It is the same with these nine statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Decalogue.</i> Now the first statement, which corresponds to the glory of God the revered who speaks, is not included among the nine statements, for it is the first of the ten in number.<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">It is the basis of all that follows. Similarly, the number one is not included among the ten numbers.</i> Now the second statement, which is <i>Thou shalt have no</i>…etc. (v. 3), corresponds to the highest sphere, which moves west to east and propels the other spheres to make a twenty-four hour east-to-west circuit in contrast to its own motion.<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">Which moves west to east.</i> It is in reference to this sphere that Scripture states, <i>other gods.</i> It says this to let us know that the spheres run by the power of God. Many considered this sphere to be the creator because it is incorporeal. The third statement, namely, <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</i> (v. 7), corresponds to the sphere of the constellations wherein are all the hosts of heaven, with the exception of the seven moving stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Each of which has its own sphere. Literally, the seven ministers.</i> Now this important sphere encompasses all the forty-eight bodies<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">Heavenly bodies.</i> and their forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on verse 3 and the notes thereto.</i> God’s power is there revealed to the eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">God’s power is seen in the arrangement of the stars.</i> There are places in this sphere which contain many stars. There are other places in it which have no stars. It is impossible for a man to know this secret. Many of those deficient in wisdom think that these forms in their arrangement were created in vain.<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the third statement reads, <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</i></i> The fourth statement, the statement about the Sabbath, corresponds to the sphere of Saturn. The astrologers<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the experimenters.</i> tell us that each one of the moving stars has a certain day in the week in which its power is manifest.<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Saturn dominates on the Sabbath. Indeed, the name Saturday means Saturn’s day.</i> The star is the dominant power the first hour of the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">On which it is dominant.</i> The same is true concerning the star which is the dominant power in the first hour of the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote">The star which is dominant during the first hour of the night dominates that night.</i> They say that Saturn and Mars are harmful stars. Hence harm befalls anyone who begins any work or sets out on a journey when one or the other dominates. The sages therefore said that permission was given for harming<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">Which I.E. interprets to mean for Mars and Saturn to have an evil influence.</i> on Wednesday night<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">Saturn dominates Wednesday night (Weiser).</i> and on the eve of the Sabbath. Now we do not find these two “demons”<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">Mars and Saturn.</i> ruling night and day, back to back, on any other day of the week except for Saturday.<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, this day Mars rules Friday eve and Saturn on Saturday (Weiser).</i> It is therefore unfit for one to occupy himself on Saturday with everyday matters. On the contrary, one should devote himself on this day to the fear of God. The fifth statement, namely, <i>Honor thy father and thy mother,</i> corresponds to the sphere of Jupiter,<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tzedek.</i> Literally, righteousness.</i> which indicates peace, righteousness, mercy, and the obligation to reward and honor those to whom we owe a debt of gratitude. The sixth statement, <i>Thou shalt not murder,</i> corresponds to the sphere of Mars, which points to bloodshed and wounding. There is a difference of opinion among the astrologers about whether Venus is above or below<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to sexual intercourse.</i> the sun. The wise men of India brought proof that Venus is above.<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">This has no bearing on I.E.’s comment. He inserted it as an aside on his comments on the verse.</i> Now the seventh statement, namely, <i>Thou shalt not commit adultery,</i> corresponds to the sphere of Venus, the nature of which points to all acts of intercourse and harlotry. The eighth statement, namely, <i>Thou shalt not steal,</i> corresponds to the sphere of the sun and indicates force. It removes the power of any planet<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">The moon included.</i> that is in conjunction with it so that its light is not seen. Now the ninth statement, namely, <i>Thou shalt not bear false witness,</i> corresponds to the sphere of Mercury, which indicates language.<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the tongue. According to the Talmud anyone born when Mercury dominates will be wise. See <i>Sabbath</i> 156a.</i> The tenth statement, namely, <i>Thou shalt not covet,</i> clearly corresponds to the sphere of the moon, which is the lowest of the spheres. It indicates desire.

Verse 15

AND ALL THE PEOPLE PERCEIVED THE THUNDERINGS.<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and all the people saw the thunderings, hence I.E. comments.</i> I have already explained the meaning of “saw the thunderings.”<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 5:21.</i> Scripture says the aforementioned because all the senses are perceived in one place.<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 5:21.</i> Now the meaning of our verse is: when Israel saw these wonders, that is, when the people perceived the thunderings and the lightning, which people normally fear, and the voice of the horn, a sound such as had never been heard of before, and the mountain smoking, they trembled. The meaning of <i>va-yanu’u</i> (and they trembled) is, and they moved; that is, each one of them turned from where he was standing and went backwards. <i>Va-yanu’u</i> is similar to the word <i>na</i> (a fugitive) in <i>a fugitive and a wanderer</i> (Gen. 4:12). The word <i>va-yanu’u</i> (were moved) in <i>And the posts</i> (amot) <i>of the door</i> (ha-sippim) <i>were moved</i> (Is. 6:4) is similar. The meaning of <i>amot</i> (posts) in the aforementioned verse is cubits, for the thresholds<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. renders <i>sippim</i> (doors) as thresholds.</i> moved a number of cubits from their place.<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., Is. 6:4 should be rendered: and the thresholds moved some cubits.</i> The prophet was not able to estimate, in his vision, how many cubits they moved. It is impossible to maintain that <i>va-yanu’u</i> means: and they trembled. For if Israel did not remove themselves from their place, how did they stand far off?

Verse 16

AND THEY SAID. The reference is to the priests and the heads of the tribes who were close to Moses. They spoke to Moses after the Ten Statements were completed because they were very anxious, for they feared that God would continue to speak to them and that they would consequently die. That is why Moses told them, <i>Fear not</i> (v. 17).

Verse 17

AND MOSES SAID. The <i>lamed</i> in the word <i>le-va’avor</i> (for) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">It has no meaning, for <i>le-va’avor</i> (for) means the same thing as <i>ba-avur.</i></i> It is like the <i>lamed</i> in the word <i>le-mabbarishonah</i> (at the first) (I Chron. 15:13) and the <i>lamed</i> of <i>le-avshalom</i> (Absalom) in <i>Absalom the son of Maacah</i> (I Chron. 3:2).
[TO PROVE YOU.] <i>To prove you</i> is similar in meaning to <i>and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end</i> (Deut. 8:16).
AND THAT HIS FEAR MAY BE BEFORE YOU. As it is written, <i>the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb</i> (Deut. 4:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">The verse goes on to say, <i>that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live upon the earth.</i></i>

Verse 18

AND THE PEOPLE STOOD AFAR OFF. Scripture mentions this a second time because Moses did the opposite. They stood from afar; however, Moses drew near the thick darkness.

Verse 19

AND THE LORD SAID. Many err because they found Scripture stating, <i>and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire</i> (Deut. 4:36) that God was on Mount Sinai, for it is written, <i>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai</i> (Ex. 19:20). However, Scripture here states, <i>I have talked with you from heaven.</i> Now he who is intelligent will understand its meaning from my comments on the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 33:21.</i> What I will now do is offer a parable. Perhaps this will help the unintelligent understand. Imagine the form of a person standing with his feet on Mount Sinai and his head in heaven. This is the meaning of <i>And the Lord came down</i> (Ex. 19:20) and of God’s speaking from heaven. It is similar to <i>And His feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives</i> (Zech. 14:4), for we know that God’s glory fills heaven and earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">There is thus no need for Him to go up or come down (Weiser). God is all over.</i>

Verse 20

YE SHALL NOT MAKE WITH ME. Its meaning is: Look, I who dwell in heaven spoke to you without any intermediary.<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">That is why <i>Ye shall not make with Me—gods of silver, or gods of gold.</i> (v. 20).</i> Indeed, Scripture explicitly states, <i>The Lord spoke with you face to face</i> (Deut. 5:4). Do not be perplexed because Scripture repeats, <i>ye shall not make</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase <i>Ye shall not make</i> appears twice in our verse.</i> Scripture is following elegant Hebrew style. It is similar to <i>Thou shalt not covet</i> (v. 14).<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">Which is found twice in verse 14 even though once would suffice.</i> It all has one meaning,<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">Whether repeated or not.</i> to be read as follows: “Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold.” It is like <i>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</i> (v. 4). Its meaning is: do not make forms that receive powers from above and think that you make them for My glory, in that they will serve as an intermediary between Me and you, like the golden calf which Israel made. As I will explain in its place, Aaron made the golden calf for God’s glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 31:18.</i> God warned Israel at the beginning<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning the laws, after revelation of the Ten Statements.</i> not to make gods of gold because He knew that Israel would make the golden calf. 
The meaning of <i>with Me</i> thus is: I have no need for intermediaries to be with Me. Scripture therefore states afterwards, <i>I will come unto thee and bless thee.</i> Its meaning is, through My glory I will come unto thee.

Verse 21

AN ALTAR OF STONE.<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible reads, <i>an altar of earth.</i> That is what I.E. comments upon.</i> Some say that the reason<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition to use hewn stones in constructing the altar.</i> is that they not make images on the altar. Scripture therefore commanded that the altar be constructed from unhewn stones. Perhaps these commentators can explain why the entire tabernacle was adorned with cherubim and why cherubim of gold were placed over the arkcover. Furthermore, the entire temple constructed by Solomon was decorated with cherubim, images,<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>temunot.</i> However, I Kings 6:32 reads, <i>timmorot</i> (palm trees). It is possible that <i>temunot</i> is a scribal error and that we should read <i>timmorot.</i></i> and open flowers (I Kings 6:32). These places were more important than the place of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">Why then would God prohibit similar images on the altar?</i> I will speak on this in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa.</i> Some say that the meaning of <i>An altar of earth</i> is that the altar shall not be constructed on a high place. However, this is not what the words imply. The fact that Scripture goes on to state next, <i>And if thou make Me an altar of stone</i> is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote">That “earth” is to be taken literally, for if it is not to be taken literally then neither is “stone.”</i> Our sages said that <i>An altar of earth</i> means that the bronze altar<sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 27:1-8.</i> is to be filled with earth. They spoke the truth, for that is what they did. However, this verse serves only as a reminder<sup class="footnote-marker">323</sup><i class="footnote">That the bronze altar was filled with earth.</i> and as a support.<sup class="footnote-marker">324</sup><i class="footnote">For the tradition that the bronze altar was to be filled with earth.</i> This<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">The interpretation that an <i>altar of earth</i> means that the bronze altar is to be filled with earth.</i> is not its literal meaning. The earth that was placed in the altar was not essential,<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">It was not an actual part of the bronze altar. Indeed when Israel journeyed from place to place the earth was left behind. Hence it would not be referred to as an <i>altar of earth</i></i> and the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote">Described in Ex. 27:1-8.</i> was known only as the bronze altar. It was so named because it was made out of bronze. The altar of incense<sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 30:1-8.</i> was also called the gold altar because it was covered with gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote">The point is the altar of incense had two names. However, unlike the earth placed in the bronze altar, the gold was an essential part of the altar.</i> Furthermore, if the implication of <i>An altar of earth</i> is an altar filled with earth, then the meaning of <i>an altar of stone</i> is an altar filled with stones. However, we cannot say that the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">Referred to in Scripture as an altar of stone.</i> was not constructed of stones, for Scripture explicitly tells us that it was made out of stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">331</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 27:5.</i> The reference<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 27:5.</i> is to the altar made on Mount Ebal. I will now explain. Saadiah Gaon says that there is a difference of opinion concerning the altar that Moses built beneath Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">333</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 24:4.</i> Some say that he built the altar before the giving of the Torah. Others maintain that he built it afterwards. The Gaon agrees with the first opinion. He says that what Scripture records in this chapter, namely, the chapter which contains the words <i>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do</i> (Ex. 19:8), is repeated in the second chapter, that is, in the chapter that reads, <i>All that the Lord hath spoken will we do, and obey</i> (Ex. 24:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">334</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that they refer to the same event.</i> I will prove to you conclusively that Moses built the altar after the giving of the Torah. This chapter clearly states that God told Moses, when he went up to the mountain of God prior to the giving of the Torah, <i>Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians…Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice</i> (Ex. 19:4, 5). God started by saying, <i>Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob</i> (Ex. 19:3). Now Moses did not relate<sup class="footnote-marker">335</sup><i class="footnote">At that time.</i> any commandments, statutes, or ordinances to Israel. He merely wanted to hear from their very lips whether they wanted to listen to God’s voice and do what He commanded them. Israel replied by saying, <i>we will do</i> (Ex. 19:8). Scripture then goes on to report, <i>And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord</i> (Ex. 19:9). Moses then sanctified Israel so that they would be fit to hear God’s word, which consisted of the Ten Statements. He now<sup class="footnote-marker">336</sup><i class="footnote">After the Ten Statements were revealed.</i> started to instruct the people in God’s commandments. When Moses approached the thick darkness God told him everything stated in the section that begins, <i>Ye shall not make with Me</i> (v. 20)<sup class="footnote-marker">337</sup><i class="footnote">That is, verses 20-23.</i> and the entire chapter of <i>Now these are the ordinances</i> (Ex. 21:1) up to, <i>for they will be a snare unto thee</i> (Ex. 23:33). Scripture then tells us, <i>And Moses came</i> (Ex. 24:3); that is, he came down from the mountain. Scripture then goes on to state, <i>and</i> [<i>Moses</i>] <i>told the people all the words of the Lord and all the ordinances</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>). <i>The words of the Lord</i> refers to the positive and negative commandments, starting with <i>Ye shall not make with Me—gods of silver</i> (v. 20); the account of the altar and all the positive and negative commandments found in the chapter that begins, <i>And these are the Ordinances,</i> such as <i>thou shalt surely bring it back to him again</i> (Ex. 23:4); <i>thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down</i> (Ex. 22:25), and <i>Thou shalt not revile God</i> (Ex. 22:27). The ordinances refer to the laws dealing with slavery, assault, fights, goring, arson, theft, oaths. It is concerning these that Scripture there writes, <i>and all the ordinances</i> (Ex. 24:3). It is concerning these laws that our forefathers said, <i>will we do, and obey</i> (Ex. 24:7). The meaning of <i>will we do</i> is, we will observe the positive and the negative commandments. The meaning of <i>and obey</i> is: we will obey the ordinances. The Israelites therefore added <i>and obey,</i> something which they at first<sup class="footnote-marker">338</sup><i class="footnote">Before the revelation of the Ten Statements.</i> did not say<sup class="footnote-marker">339</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 19:8.</i> following the giving of the Torah. The meaning of <i>An altar of earth</i> clearly is, as the phrase implies, an altar made out of earth. This is what Scripture refers to when it writes later, <i>and builded an altar under the mount</i> (Ex. 24:4). Scripture here writes, <i>and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings</i> (v. 21), and it is there written, [and they] <i>offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings</i> (Ex. 24:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">340</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the altar mentioned here and the altar mentioned in Ex. 24:5 were built for the same purpose. This supports I.E.’s contention that the reference is to the same altar.</i> There is no doubt that the section beginning, <i>An altar of earth</i> and also <i>Ye shall not make with Me</i> (v. 20) were stated because of the blood of the covenant which Moses dashed on the altar (Ex. 24:6) and because the people pledged that the Lord alone would be their God and that they would observe His commandments and ordinances (Ex. 24:7). Scripture mentions, <i>thy sheep, and thine oxen</i> (v. 21) because both of them are kinds of animals from which burnt offerings and peace offerings may be brought.<sup class="footnote-marker">341</sup><i class="footnote">These were the offerings brought by Moses after God’s revelation to Israel.</i> I saw a heretic, may his bones be crushed, arguing against the sages of the Talmud for saying, <i>Which was the place appointed for the sacrifices</i> (<i>Zevachim</i> 5:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">342</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5 of tractate <i>Zevachim</i> deals with the place set aside for the various sacrifices. The term used by the Mishnah for various sacrifices is <i>zevachim.</i></i> The heretic claimed that he never found the Torah using the term sacrifice (<i>zevach</i>) except for a peace offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas the rabbis in tractate <i>Zevachim</i> apply it to all sorts of sacrificial offerings.</i> We thus find Scripture speaking of a burnt offering and sacrifices (<i>zevachim</i>). The burnt offering is an entity unto itself, and sacrifices refer only to peace offerings, as in [and they] <i>offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto the Lord</i> (Ex. 24:5). We<sup class="footnote-marker">344</sup><i class="footnote">So argued the heretic.</i> find this to be the case all over. Now I showed this heretic that what he said was incorrect. Scripture here states, <i>and shalt sacrifice</i><sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ve-zavachta.</i> We thus see that the term <i>zavach</i> also applies to peace offerings. Similarly with the noun <i>zevach/zevachim.</i></i> <i>thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings.</i> He then admitted that he sinned in contradicting people eminently greater than any who lived in all the generations that came after them.
[IN EVERY PLACE WHERE I CAUSE MY NAME TO BE MENTIONED.] Its meaning and interpretation is, in every place where I will set a memorial for My name, that is, in every place where My glory dwells such as Shilo and Nob where the ark stood. If you come to the aforementioned place for the sake of My name to visit Me, I too will come unto you and bless you.
[I WILL COME UNTO THEE.] This is an anthropomorphism. Its meaning is: you will find Me in the place upon which I cause My name to be mentioned, which is the place of My glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">346</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the place where God’s glory dwells.</i> I, as it were, came to you because I knew that you would come and it is because of you that I came. Furthermore, because you came to pay Me homage, <i>I will come unto thee and bless thee.</i> You will have no need to seek anyone else, for you will find Me as long as My glory is there.

AND IF THOU MAKE ME AN ALTAR OF STONE.

Its meaning is similar to that of <i>but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man</i> (Ex. 33:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">357</sup><i class="footnote">Which, according to I.E., is short for: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, did the ministry of a young man. See I.E. on Ex. 33:11.</i> Similarly here, <i>lo tivneh ethem gazit</i> (do not build a hewn structure out of them).<sup class="footnote-marker">358</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>lo tivneh ethem gazit</i> (literally, you shall not build them hewn stones) is short for <i>lo tivneh ethem binyan gazit.</i></i> The word <i>gazit</i> (hewn stones) comes from the same root as <i>gozeze</i> (shearers) in <i>and went up unto his sheep-shearers</i> (Gen. 38:12) and <i>gaz</i> (cut) in, <i>For it is speedily cut, and we fly away</i> (Ps. 90:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">359</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> It is the same case with <i>nagozu</i> (cut) in <i>Even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away</i> (Nahum 1:12). Its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">360</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>gazit.</i></i> is, cut.<sup class="footnote-marker">361</sup><i class="footnote">Or hewn.</i> Only unhewn stones, that is, stones as God created them, [were to be used].
FOR IF THOU LIFTED UP THY TOOL UPON IT. The word <i>cherev</i> (tool) refers to an iron instrument made for cutting.<sup class="footnote-marker">362</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>cherev</i> usually means a sword. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is possible that the instrument is called a <i>cherev</i> because it destroys (<i>mecharevet</i>). Scripture elsewhere states, <i>thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them</i> (Deut. 27:5),<sup class="footnote-marker">363</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>barzel</i> (iron tool) rather than <i>cherev</i> is used in this parallel verse. We thus see that <i>cherev</i> refers to an iron tool used for cutting.</i> that is, upon the altar of stones that Israel built.<sup class="footnote-marker">364</sup><i class="footnote">Upon crossing the Jordan.</i> We should not look for explanations for the commandments. However, from a rational point of view it is possible that the prohibition against hewn stones is similar to the law governing “a vile thing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>piggul.</i> Sacrificial flesh which has spoiled. See Lev. 7:18.</i> It is unseemly for that which is left over from a sacrifice which was brought upon the altar to become vile, for if what remains of a sacrifice becomes vile then the sacrifice, which was sanctified, is defiled. The same is true of the prohibition against hewn stones. It is possible that the chips that result from the stone-cutting be profaned by being dedicated to idolatrous use if the builders cut stones in order to build an altar. The latter would be disrespectful. Now Scripture states<sup class="footnote-marker">366</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>Now we have seen.</i></i> that the priest atones upon the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">367</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the altar is treated in the manner of a sacrifice which is brought upon it.</i>

Verse 23

NEITHER SHALT THOU GO UP BY STEPS UNTO MINE ALTAR. Ben Zuta says that <i>be-ma’alot</i> (by steps) comes from the same root as <i>ma’al</i> (trespass).<sup class="footnote-marker">368</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ben Zuta our text should be translated: Neither shalt thou go up in a trespassing manner (<i>be-ma’alot</i>) upon My altar.</i> However, he did not open his eyes and see that the <i>mem</i> in <i>ma’al</i> is a root letter, as <i>u-ma’alah vo ma’al</i> (and act unfaithfully against him) (Num. 5:12) proves.<sup class="footnote-marker">369</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ma’alah</i> is a third person <i>kal</i> whole root form. Therefore, the root of <i>u-ma’alah</i> has to be <i>mem, ayin, lamed.

Compare, <i>and worn shoes</i> (ne’alot) <i>and clouted upon their feet, and worn garments</i> (Josh. 9:5). Thus <i>be-ma’alot</i> should have been vocalized <i>bi-me’alot,</i> that is, with a <i>chirik</i> beneath the <i>bet</i><sup class="footnote-marker">371</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>bet</i> prefixed to a letter beginning with a <i>sheva</i> is vocalized with a <i>chirik.</i></i> and a <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>ayin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">372</sup><i class="footnote">If it came from the root <i>mem, ayin, lamed,</i> for that is the way this paradigm is vocalized.

Ben Zuta clearly intended to ascend the ladder of wisdom with his follies. However, his nakedness was uncovered thereon. This is what happens to every heretic who does not believe in the words of our ancient sages. The law prohibiting the use of steps to go up to the altar takes in all altars of earth, stones, or copper. The phrase <i>Mine altar</i> implies all altars made for the Lord.

Chapter 21



Verse 1

One who pays attention to meanings, both general and particular, will understand why a <i>vav</i> precedes <i>Eleh Ha-Mishpatim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This portion opens with a connective <i>vav</i>. As I.E. explains in his next comment, the <i>vav</i> connects Ex. 21:1 with the verses that come before it.</i>
NOW THESE ARE THE ORDINANCES.

Verse 2

IF THOU BUY. Before I begin to explain<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The ordinances.</i> let me give you a general rule. Each ordinance or commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Recorded in Ex. 21:2-23:19.</i> is an independent unit. If we are able to find a reason that two ordinances or commandments are connected to each other, then we will expend all of our efforts to connect them. If we are not able to do so, we will conclude that the reason this cannot be done is our intellectual deficiency.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Although each commandment or ordinance is an independent unit, they were not thrown together haphazardly.</i> There is nothing in the world more difficult for a human being to bear than to be under the control of another person like himself. Scripture therefore began<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The list of ordinances.</i> with the law of the Hebrew servant. Our sages said that the Hebrew servant<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in our verse.</i> is an Israelite. The same applies to <i>And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant</i> (v. 7).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7 refers to an Israelite.</i> However, our sages maintain that <i>And if a man smite the eye of his bondmen</i> (v. 26) refers to a Canaanite.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a Canaanite bondman. By Canaanite, the sages meant non-Israelite.</i> Similarly, <i>If the ox gore a bondman</i> (v. 32).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a Canaanite bondman.</i> And they said that <i>then he shall be sold for his theft</i> (Ex. 22:2) refers to an Israelite. Those who dispute with our sages say that the Hebrew slave<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in this verse.</i> is not an Israelite but rather someone of Abraham’s family.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Someone descended from Abraham, such as an Ishmaelite, Edomite or the like. Abraham was known as Abraham the Hebrew (Gen. 14:13). Hence his descendants, whether Israelites or not, are called Hebrews according to this interpretation.</i> The same is true of the daughter sold into slavery<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> and of all the slaves mentioned afterwards. They are to be understood in the same way.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As Hebrew slaves, that is, as people descended from Abraham.</i> Their proof is from <i>the wife and her children</i> (v. 4),<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Who remain in slavery. They could not believe that the children of an Israelite would remain in slavery, for they believed these children to be Israelites.</i> for they say that family identity is established by the father.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the children of an Israelite man and a non-Israelite woman are considered Israelites.</i> They offer additional proof from <i>and he shall serve him for ever</i> (v. 6), for they say that the latter means all of the slave’s life.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Contra the rabbis, who maintain that <i>for ever</i> means until the jubilee year.</i> It was difficult for them to accept that an Israelite would have his ear pierced.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">And be a slave in perpetuity.</i> Let us now seek the plain meaning of the words.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Employed by Scripture. The reference is to the term <i>ivri</i> (Hebrew).</i> If the Hebrew slave is not an Israelite, then why did Scripture state, <i>If thy brother, a Hebrew man…be sold unto thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee</i>. Thus Deut. 15:12 and our verse refer to the same type of servant. Now if the term Hebrew does not refer to an Israelite, why does Scripture use the term brother? Brother refers only to an Israelite. If Deut. 15:12 referred to a non-Israelite it should have read, “If a Hebrew man be sold unto thee.” We thus see that our verse refers to an Israelite.</i> (Deut. 15:12)? Do we not know that brother in <i>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart</i> (Lev. 19:17) means an Israelite? It is the same case with <i>between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him</i> (Deut. 1:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear that brother refers to an Israelite, for <i>brother</i> stands in contrast to <i>stranger</i>.</i> There are many such cases. Now there is no doubt that the meaning of <i>Abram the Hebrew</i> (Gen. 14:13) is: Abram of the children of Eber, about whom Scripture says <i>avi kol bene ever</i>, (the father of all the children of Eber) (Gen. 10:21),<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Any descendants of Eber who accept the teaching of Eber is called an <i>ivri</i>. See I.E.’s comments on v. 8.</i> in contrast to <i>and Ham is the father of Canaan</i> (Gen. 9:18). On the other hand, it is possible that Abram was called the Hebrew because he came from beyond the river,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for beyond is <i>ever</i>. See Josh. 24:2, <i>Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River</i> (be-ever ha-nahar). According to this interpretation, Abraham was called the <i>ivri</i> because he came from beyond (<i>ever</i>) the river.</i> although in this case the term used should have been <i>ivri nahari</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for river is <i>nahar</i>.</i> rather than <i>ivri</i>. Let us assume that Scripture was being brief,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ivri</i> is short for <i>ivri nahari</i>.</i> because we find that the Bible states, <i>And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River</i> (me-ever ha-nahar) (Josh. 24:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The point is, anyone acquainted with the Bible will know that <i>ivri</i> is short for <i>ivri nahari</i>.</i> The Hebrews are also called Israelites, for we see that Moses told Pharaoh, <i>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel</i> (Ex. 5:1). However, when Pharaoh asked Moses, “Who is this God?”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>Who is the Lord</i>? (Ex. 5:2).</i> Moses answered him, <i>The God of the Hebrews</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.). The God of the Hebrews thus means the same as the God of Israel. Now if the Israelites are called Hebrews because they are related to Eber, then the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham’s concubine. See Gen. 25:1.</i> and the children of Esau should be joined to us. However, we do not find Scripture referring to any people as our brothers except for Edom,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The descendants of Esau. See Deut. 23:8.</i> who shared one womb with Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">That is, whose ancestor shared one womb with Jacob.</i> We also do not find Scripture referring to Esau<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Edom.</i> as our brother in commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Edom too is not joined with us.</i> We find him referred to as a brother only in the account of the messengers.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Moses sent messengers to Edom asking for permission to pass through their land. See Num. 20:14.</i> The same applies to <i>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother</i> (Deut. 23:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Edom is not here referred to as a brother in commandments.</i> wherein Scripture mentions <i>he is thy brother</i> after first mentioning the term <i>Edomite</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>brother</i> in Deut. 23:8 explains why we are not to hate an Edomite. It does not mean that he is our brother in commandments.</i> The same is true of <i>Because he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Edom.</i><i> did pursue his brother</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> <i>with the sword</i> (Amos 1:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This verse does not imply that Edom and Israel are brothers in <i>mitzvot</i>.</i> Now we do not find in all of Scripture the word Hebrew employed except in regard to the children of Jacob. Scripture thus states: <i>And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew</i> (Gen. 41:12); <i>because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews</i> (Gen. 43:32); <i>an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew</i> (Ex. 2:11); <i>two men of the Hebrews were striving together</i> (Ex. 2:13). Jonah said, <i>I am a Hebrew</i> (Jonah 1:9) because he was asked, <i>and of what people art thou</i> (Jonah v. 1:8). If the term Hebrew had referred to many nations, Jonah would not yet have told them of what people he was.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">By saying <i>I am a Hebrew</i>, he might be saying I am an Edomite, or a Moabite, or the like.</i> Scripture also states, <i>that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews</i> (I Sam. 4:9);<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The reference there is clearly to that of an Israelite.</i> <i>Now the Hebrews</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Israelites.</i> <i>that were with the Philistines</i> (I Sam. 14:21). The book of Jeremiah states: <i>that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free</i> (Jer. 34:9). The latter closes by explaining, <i>that none should make bondmen of them, even of a Jew his brother</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.). Now it is known that an Edomite is not called a Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the term Hebrew in Jer. 34:9 cannot apply to him. I.E. notes this because he had earlier noted that Scripture refers to the Edomites as brothers.</i> Those who disagree with our sages say, look, it is written: <i>And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews</i> (mityahadim) (Esther 8:17)<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the term Jew can be applied to someone who is not born a Jew. Hence the term Jew in Jer. 34:9 may also apply to a non-Jew, that is, to a non-Jewish slave who observes some of the commandments (Filwarg).</i> in reference to those who were not Jews. This is blindness. For according to their opinion, whether the meaning of the word <i>mityahadim</i> (became Jews) is that they claimed to be Jews or that <i>mityahadim</i> means they accepted Judaism,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>mityahadim</i> means: praised the Jews.</i> Scripture should have read, “even of one of his brothers who became Jewish.”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 34:9 refers to the man-servant as a <i>yehudi</i>, a Jew. If the reference was to those not born Jewish, i.e., slaves who belong to Jews and practice Judaism, then the term used should have been <i>mityahed</i>, acting Jewish.</i> Furthermore, the word <i>mitabber</i> (becoming a Hebrew)<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">There is no Hebrew word with this meaning.</i> should be formed from the word <i>ivri</i> according to this interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">If the word <i>mityahed</i> means to claim to be Jewish or to become a Jew, then a parallel form, <i>mitabber</i>, should exist.

SIX YEARS HE SHALL SERVE. And no longer. It is like <i>Six years thou shalt sow thy field</i> (Lev. 25:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">And no longer, for the seventh year is a Sabbatical year.</i> At the start of the seventh year of his being sold he shall go free no matter what year it be.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">No matter what year of the fifty-year count to the Jubilee.</i> Do not be amazed that Jeremiah writes, <i>At the end of seven years</i> (Jer. 34:14),<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas our verse states that a slave goes free at the beginning of the seventh year.</i> because everything has two ends and sometimes the end is found at the beginning and sometimes it is at the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Thus at the end of seven years means: at the beginning of the seventh year. A physical object has two ends, Each of the ends is also the first part of the object. I.E. applies this concept to a non-tangible object such as years.</i> Our verse deals with a servant whom the law courts have sold, namely, an individual concerning whom it is written, <i>then he shall be sold for his theft</i> (Ex. 22:2). However, <i>And if thy brother be waxen poor with thee, and was sold unto you</i> (Lev. 25:39)<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> or <i>to a stranger</i> (Lev. 25:47) refers to a slave who sells himself according to the years remaining to the year of jubilee, for such a servant goes out when the Jubilee comes. Israel has a tradition that males but not females are sold because they stole. I will finish the matter in the chapter which follows. Rabbi Merinus says that the <i>yod</i> of the word <i>la-chofshi</i> (tree) is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>la-chofshi</i> (free) has the same meaning as <i>la-chofesh</i> (unto freedom). Cf. Rashi, <i>chofshi: la-cherut</i> (unto freedom).</i> It is like the yod of <i>le-mishi</i> (for cleansing) (Ezek. 16:4) and the <i>yod</i> of <i>akhzari</i> (cruel) (Prov. 11:17). However, Rabbi Judah the grammarian says the <i>lamed</i> of <i>la</i>-<i>chofshi</i> (free) is superfluous because its meaning is similar to <i>chofshi</i> (free) in <i>And when thou lettest him go free</i> (Deut. 15:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>la-chofshi</i> means <i>chofshi</i> (free).</i> Its <i>yod</i> is, as it were, the <i>yod</i> of relationship, like the <i>yod</i> of <i>ha-kadmoni</i> (of the east gate) (Ezek. 19:19). The <i>lamed</i> of <i>la-chofshi</i> is like the <i>lamed</i> of <i>la-avshalom</i> (Absalom)<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>lamed</i> of <i>la-avshalom</i> is superfluous, for <i>la-avshalom</i> means Absolam, not unto Absolam.</i> in <i>the third, Absalom the son of Maacah</i> (I Chron. 3:2). However, in my opinion the <i>lamed</i> and the <i>yod</i> in <i>la-chofshi</i> are both prepositions, even though one would have sufficed.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture could have read either <i>la-chofesh</i> or <i>chofshi</i>.</i> <i>Chofshi</i> is similar to <i>ha-oholi</i> (of my tent) (Josh. 7:21) in <i>in the midst of my tent</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha-oholi</i> has an emphatic <i>heh</i> prefix and a first person pronoun <i>yod</i> suffix. According to Hebrew grammar, the emphatic <i>heh</i> is not suffixed to a declined noun. Josh. 7:21 thus should have read, <i>ha-ohel</i>, or <i>oholi</i>. We thus see that Scripture sometimes combines two forms.</i> <i>Chofshi</i> (free) is an adjective.
[FOR NOTHING.] The word <i>chinnam</i> (for nothing) comes from the same root as <i>channunu</i> (grant)<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>chet, nun, nun</i>.</i> in <i>grant them</i> (Jud. 21:22).

A <i>mem</i> suffixed to a word is sometimes a third person plural pronominal suffix. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 3

IF HE COME IN BY HIMSELF. Some say that the word <i>be-gappo</i> (by himself) has the same meaning as <i>be-gufo</i> (with his body). Now we find the phrase <i>gufat sha’ul</i> (the body of Saul) (I Chron. 10:12) in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The absolute form of <i>gufat</i> is <i>gufah. Gufah</i> with the third person pronominal suffix is <i>gufato</i>. Thus our verse should have read <i>gufato</i> rather than <i>gappo</i>.</i> However, the forms of nouns change.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The same word comes in different forms.</i> Others say<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, <i>be-gappo</i>: in the wing (skirt) of his garment.</i> that <i>gappo</i> (himself) has the meaning of wing. Wings are referred to as <i>gappin</i> in Aramaic. It is as if Scripture read, if he came in bondage possessing only the wing of his garment.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>gappo</i> refers to the wing (corner) of his garment.</i> However, this is out of context, for the context requires us to explain <i>be-gappo</i> as meaning that he carries no other body on his back. <i>Gappo</i> is like <i>gabbi</i> (my back) in <i>The plowers plowed upon my back</i> (Ps. 129:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>gappo</i> is a variant of <i>gabbo</i> (his back), for the <i>bet</i> and <i>peh</i> sometimes interchange because they are similarly sounded labials.</i> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that Scripture had to say, <i>If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself</i><sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, why repeat that the slave goes out free after having stated the same in verse 2?</i> while saying<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">That is, immediately after saying (Filwarg). For other interpretations see Krinsky.</i> <i>he shall go out free</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The question is, why does Scripture repeat itself?</i> because of his wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">That is, because it wanted to go on and explain the law dealing with the slave’s wife, and it is the style of Scripture to repeat itself when it introduces a new law.</i> that is, the Torah had to say, if he be married.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Then his wife goes out with him. For other interpretations see Krinsky and Filwarg.</i> Now if an Israelite women is not sold by a law court for theft, why does Scripture say, <i>then his wife shall go out with him</i>? It states this to teach us that the one who acquires a Hebrew slave is obligated to support his [the slave’s] wife. She is with him until they go out together.

Verse 4

IF HIS MASTER GIVE HIM A WIFE. We find that those who employ the holy tongue render honor with various nouns<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, with the laws of nouns. The plural form of certain nouns is employed honorifically.</i> but not with verbs. They use the terms <i>adon</i> (lord) and also <i>adonim</i> (lords).<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">When referring to a lord or master.</i> They employ the latter as a singular in a <i>cruel lord</i> (adonim) (Is. 19:4). They employ the term <i>adonav</i> (his lord)<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Adonav</i> is a plural.</i> in the construct.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">By construct I.E. means when the word <i>adonim</i> is connected to the third person pronoun <i>shelahem</i>.</i> They do not use the term <i>adono</i> (his lord),<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a singular.</i> for we do not find the word <i>adono</i> in Scripture. However, <i>Adoni</i> (my lord),<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Which is a singular.</i> as in <i>My lord asked</i> (Gen. 44:19), is employed in the first person. It is prohibited to use the plural form<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Adonai</i>.</i> so that it not be confused with God’s glorious name.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Adonai</i>.</i> It is similarly unfit to use the singular declensional form <i>adoni</i> (my lord) in <i>My lord asked</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>) when God is spoken of.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the plural form <i>Adonai</i> is used when God is referred to.</i> The same applies to the term <i>Elo’ah</i> (God).<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elo’ah</i> is in the singular. However, it is not respectful to use the singular when referring to God. Hence the plural form <i>Elohim</i> is used.</i> Rabbi Merinus says that <i>eloho</i> (their god),<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Which is <i>elo’ah</i> with the third person pronominal suffix.</i> rather than <i>elohav</i> (their god),<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The plural form.</i> in <i>their might unto their god</i> (Hab. 1:11) is used in a disparaging manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Because Habakkuk speaks of pagan gods.</i>
IF HIS MASTER GIVE HIM A WIFE. A Canaanite woman according to our sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta, Mishpatim</i> 1.</i> It is possible that the meaning of a Canaanite women is in keeping with <i>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you</i> (Lev. 25:45) conceming whom it is written, <i>of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids</i> (Lev. 25:44).<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Canaanite is not to be taken literally.

Verse 5

BUT IF THE SERVANT SHALL PLAINLY SAY. Our sages have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mekhilta, Mishpatim</i> 11.</i> that his ear is not pierced unless all these conditions,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Listed in our verse, i.e., <i>I love my master</i>, etc.</i> including <i>because he loveth thee and thy house</i> (Deut. 15:16), have been fulfilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the servant’s ear is not pierced unless all the conditions listed in verse 5 and in Deut. 15:16 have been fulfilled.</i>

Verse 6

THEN HIS MASTER SHALL BRING HIM UNTO GOD. The term <i>Elohim</i> (God) means those who establish God’s laws in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>elohim</i> means judges.</i> It is customary for the judges to sit in the gate of a city that has doors and a bolt. <i>To the door or the door-post</i> means that what Scripture deals with in this verse is to be performed before those who sit in the gate.
AND HE SHALL SERVE HIM FOR EVER. We know that the word <i>le-olam</i> (for ever) in Hebrew refers to time, as in <i>it hath been already, in the ages</i> (le-olamim) <i>which were before us</i> (Eccles. 1:10), wherein <i>olamim</i> means ages.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, for ever here means some definite time span.</i> Similarly, <i>ve-yashav sham ad olam</i> (and there abide for ever) (I Sam. 1:22) means: and he will there abide until he grows up. <i>Va-avado le-olam</i> (and he shall serve him for ever) likewise means: and he will serve him until the year of jubilee,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of the sages of the Talmud. See <i>Mekhilta</i> on third verse.</i> for there is no season of Israel that is longer than it.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The jubilee year comes around once in 50 years.</i> Going free is comparable to a renewal of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture reads, <i>va-avado le-olam</i> (and he shall serve him for ever); that is, he shall serve him until the world is renewed, namely, the year of jubilee when all slaves are freed. The word <i>le-olam</i> literally means to a world. Hence I.E.’s comment. This interpretation appears to differ slightly from the preceding one, which took the word <i>olam</i> to mean time.</i> It is also possible that its meaning is that he should be as he was in former times.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, he should return to his former “time.” This interpretation takes the word <i>le-olam</i> to mean: to a time.</i>

Verse 7

AND IF A MAN SELL HIS DAUGHTER TO BE A MAID-SERVANT. Scripture speaks of a minor who is under her father’s control, like the daughter whose oaths a father may annul.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 30:4-6.</i> The phrase <i>unto a foreign people</i> (v. 8) is connected to this verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than to what precedes it in verse 8.</i> For <i>unto a foreign people</i> speaks of the father.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the father is not permitted to sell his daughter <i>unto a foreign people</i>. I.E. takes foreign people literally, that is, to a non-Jewish nation.</i>

Verse 8

TO SELL HER UNTO A FOREIGN PEOPLE HE SHALL HAVE NO POWER, SEEING THAT HE HATH DEALT DECEITFULLY WITH HER. <i>Bi-vigdo</i> (that he hath dealt deceitfully) is similar to the word <i>nivgad</i> (we deal treacherously) in <i>Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother</i> (Mal. 2:10). It is true and correct that the master has no right to sell her to an Israelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">The sages say that <i>to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power</i> refers to both her father and her master. They take foreign nation to mean any stranger. See <i>Kiddushin</i> 19a.</i> We know this from tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power</i> refers only to the father. See note 121.</i> The sages used this verse as a peg and as a support.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">For their tradition.</i> Do not be surprised at the distance between <i>unto a foreign people</i> and the verse to which it is connected,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Verge 7.</i> for as I will explain, it is the same case with <i>he shall make restitution</i><sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Which, according to I.E., is connected to Ex. 21:37.</i> (Ex. 22:2). Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that <i>unto a foreign people</i> means to a stranger. The same is true of <i>wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation</i><sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Am</i> (people, nation) can refer to a person. Saadiah thus interprets <i>unto a foreign people</i> as unto a stranger, and <i>a righteous nation</i> as a righteous person.</i> (Gen. 20:4). However, it is impossible that Scripture would refer to an individual by one of these terms. It is correct for Scripture to say, “and Israel said,” because Israel is a collective noun, like Egypt in <i>and Egypt said</i> (Ex. 14:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> However, it is impossible for a noun which refers to a group, such as the terms people, nation, company, and congregation, to be used for an individual. The meaning of <i>wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation</i> is explained by <i>that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin</i> (Gen. 20:9).
[SHE SHALL NOT GO OUT AS MEN-SERVANTS DO.] Its meaning is, she shall not go out as men-servants who always go out after six years. The maid-servant also goes out after six years of servitude, as Scripture states, <i>If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew women, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years</i> (Deut. 15:12). However, the maid-servant goes out if she reaches the onset of puberty before six years pass.
IF SHE PLEASE NOT HER MASTER. If she does not find favor in the eyes of her master after he bought her in order to take her for a wife. This is the meaning of <i>who hath espoused her to himself</i>; he espoused her to be his wife<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">He bought her to marry her.</i> or he espoused her to be the wife of his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>And if he espouse her unto his son</i> (v. 9).

IF HE TAKE HIM ANOTHER WIFE. Be she a daughter of Israel who was sold, or be she a daughter of Israel that was not sold.
HER FOOD. <i>She’erah</i> refers to her food. He must sustain her flesh, which is what <i>she’erah</i> means.
AND HER CONJUGAL RIGHTS. Some say that <i>ve-onatah</i> (and her conjugal rights) means: and the place of her dwelling.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">They connect it to the word <i>ma’on</i> (a dwelling place).</i> According to them, the word <i>ve-anah</i> (shall howl) in <i>and jackals shall howl</i> (Is. 13:22) and <i>ve-anetah</i> (and she shall respond) in <i>and she shall respond there</i> (Hos. 2:17) have a similar meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">The former is to be rendered: and jackals shall live there; and the latter, and she shall live there.</i> However, I believe that <i>ve-anah iyyim</i> (and jackals shall howl) is to be taken as it implies.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">It means <i>and jackals shall howl</i>.</i> <i>Ve-anah</i> is similar to <i>ve-anita</i> (and thou shalt speak) in <i>and thou shalt speak and say</i> (Deut. 26:5). <i>Ve-anah</i> is used metaphorically, for Scripture there metaphorically states, <i>and the satyr shall cry to his fellow</i> (Is. 34:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>yikra</i> (cry, or more literally, call) is parallel to <i>ve-anita</i>. Hence <i>ve-anita</i> must have a similar meaning.</i> Similarly, <i>ve-anetah</i> in <i>and she shall there respond</i> means she shall make music. <i>Ve-anetah</i> is similar to <i>enu</i> (sing) in <i>Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving</i> (Ps. 147:7). <i>Onatah</i> refers to sexual activity, also known as the time of lovemaking.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to bedding, which is the time of lovemaking.</i> The word <i>et</i> (time) is missing a <i>nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the root of <i>et</i> is <i>ayin, nun, tav</i>.</i> It is similar to the word <i>emet</i> (truth).<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Which comes from the root <i>alef, mem, nun</i>.</i> Hence the <i>tav</i> of <i>ittekh</i> (thy time) in <i>and, behold, thy time</i> (Ezek. 16:8) receives a <i>dagesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">To compensate for the missing <i>nun</i>.</i> Likewise,<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, or. That is, another example that the word <i>et</i> is similar to the word <i>emet</i>.</i> <i>itto</i> (his time) is similar to <i>amitto</i> (his truth). The word <i>attah</i> (now) is also similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the root <i>ayin, nun, tav</i> and drops a <i>nun</i>.</i> Note, <i>onatah</i> comes from the same root as <i>et</i>. The word <i>attah</i> (now) means this time.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i> at the end of the word <i>attah</i> takes the place of the <i>heh</i> which should have been placed at the beginning of the word. That is, <i>attah</i> equals <i>ha-et</i> (the time) (Weiser).</i>

Verse 11

AND IF. Scripture employed an abridged form in saying <i>shelosh eleh</i> (these three). It is similar to <i>shelosh se’im</i> (three measures) (Gen. 18:6),<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Which is also a short form.</i> for Scripture should have read, <i>ha-shelosh ha-eleh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">And similarly in Gen. 18:6 it should have read, <i>ha-shelosh ha-se’im</i>.</i> Many think that <i>these three</i> refers to her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights. However, this is impossible. After Scripture stated, <i>he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters</i> (v. 9), and one is obligated to give these three things to all daughters there is no need to mention this here. Furthermore, Scripture writes concerning the beautiful woman<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">The beautiful captive woman.</i> who is a foreigner, <i>but thou shalt not sell her at all for money</i> (Deut. 21:14). How much more so is this maid-servant not to be sold for money.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">What need is there for Scripture to say, <i>then shall she go out for nothing without money;</i> i.e., her master cannot sell her.</i> Its correct interpretation thus is: and if he does not do one of these three things, namely, if he does not marry her, or espouse her to his son, or redeem her, she shall go out for nothing when she has the onset of puberty.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">That is, if she reaches the onset of puberty before her six years of servitude are over.</i> <i>If any that is unclean by a dead body touch all of these</i>, which means one of these, <i>shall it be unclean</i><sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. See Lev. 18:24.</i> (Hag. 2:13) is similar. There are many other similar instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Where Scripture uses the term these or all of these and means one of these.</i> The Gaon asks, what reason was there for Scripture to say, <i>without money</i> after stating <i>for nothing</i>? He answers: If she took ill in her master’s house and he spent money on medicine,<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">To heal her.</i> then she did not have to pay him back anything. However, in my opinion there is no need for all of this, for Scripture offers additional explanation, such as <i>for thou shalt die, and not live</i> (II Kings 20:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 2:6.</i>

Verse 12

HE THAT SMITETH A MAN. The reason this follows the laws dealing with the man- and maid-servant is that Scripture wanted to go on and explain how to deal with one who strikes his man- and maid-servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">It therefore first had to lay down the law dealing with one who strikes a free man.</i> [A MAN.] The reference is to an Israelite.
HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. By a court of law. This is the case whenever the term <i>mot yumat</i> (he shall surely be put to death) is employed. The one exception to this will be shown shortly.

Verse 13

AND IF A MAN LIE NOT IN WAIT. <i>Tzadah</i> (lie in wait) is similar to the word <i>bi-tzediyyah</i> (lying in wait) (Num. 35:20) and <i>tzodeh</i> (layest wait) in <i>though thou layest wait for my soul to take it</i> (I Sam. 24:12). Observe, it involves laying in wait and acting presumptuously.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>tzadah</i> means to presumptuously lay in wait.</i>
BUT GOD CAUSE IT TO COME TO HAND. <i>Innah</i> (cause it to come) is similar to <i>mitanneh</i> (seeketh an occasion) in <i>he seeketh an occasion against me</i> (II Kings 5:7), the meaning of which is, he looks for reasons and excuses.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">To attack me.</i> The meaning of our clause is that God caused and arranged things so that this person would die at this individual’s hand even though he had never intended to kill him. God caused this to happen to him so that he would be exiled from his place because of some other sin which he committed. Scripture explicitly states, <i>There shall no mischief befall the righteous</i> (Prov. 12:21).

Verse 14

AND IF A MAN COME PRESUMPTUOUSLY. <i>To slay him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote"><i>With guile</i>.</i> is to be understood as if written, and slew him with guile.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the infinitive includes in it the action (Filwarg).</i> Similarly <i>If she profane by playing the harlot</i> (Lev. 21:9),<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> the meaning of which is, if she profane herself by playing the harlot and therefore <i>she profaneth her father</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.).<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Here too the infinitive <i>techel</i> (she profane) includes in it the object; that is, she profane herself.</i> It is known that the term <i>chillul</i> (profanation) and the word <i>techillah</i> (beginning) come from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">They both come from the root <i>chet, lamed, lamed</i>.</i> However, they differ in meaning. It was therefore necessary to differentiate between them. Scripture therefore reads, <i>techel li-zenot</i> (profane by playing the harlot) (Lev. 21:9), for if it had the meaning of beginning, it would read <i>tachel</i> (thou shalt begin), as in <i>tachel lispor</i> (shalt thou begin to number) (Num. 16:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Double roots conjugated in the <i>kal</i> are vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath their prefixes. However, in order to differentiate between the words, to profane was vocalized with a <i>tsere, techel</i>, and to begin follows the normal vocalization, that is, <i>tachel</i>.</i>
FROM MINE ALTAR. This is the reverse of the previous verse. It is there stated, <i>then I will appoint thee a place</i> [<i>whither he may flee</i>], the reference being to the cities of refuge. However, he who presumptuously kills and flees, even if he seeks refuge at the altar as Joab did,<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">See I Kings 2:28,29.</i> shall be put to death. Our sages said even a priest<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Who has committed murder.</i> who wants to perform the service at the altar shall be put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 85a; <i>San</i>. 35b.</i>

Verse 15

AND HE THAT SMITETH HIS FATHER. Since Scripture had previously mentioned, <i>He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death</i> (v. 12), Scripture had to explain that there is an instance where one is put to death for smiting someone even when the one who is struck does not die. This is the case when one hits one’s father. The word <i>u-makkeh</i> (and he that smiteth) is to be read as if written twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is to be understood as if written: and he that smiteth his father, and he who smiteth his mother, shall surely be put to death.</i> It was out of regard for the parents’ honor that Scripture found it necessary to state<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 17.</i> that even when one does not strike one’s parents but curses them, he is to be put to death.

Verse 16

AND HE THAT STEALETH A MAN. Saadiah Gaon asks: Why was this verse inserted between <i>He that smiteth his father</i> (v. 15) and <i>And he that curseth his father</i> (v. 17)? He answers that Scripture speaks only of the commonplace. Those stolen were young children. They were brought up in a strange country and did not recognize their parents. It is thus possible for them to strike and curse their parents. The punishment for this will fall upon the kidnapper.
OR IF HE BE FOUND IN HIS HAND. In the market before he sells him,<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>and selleth him</i> means: and intends to sell him. Otherwise, how could Scripture say, “or if he be found in his hand.”</i> then he shall be put to death.

Verse 17

AND HE THAT CURSETH. We find a curse that invokes the name of God, as in <i>and cursed them in the name of the Lord</i> (II Kings 2:24). We also find curses that do not invoke the name of God.

Verse 18

AND IF MEN CONTEND. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that <i>be-egrof</i> (with his fist) is similar to <i>egrofin</i> (strong) in “strong men.”<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote"><i>San</i>. 49a. Hebrew, <i>ba’ale egrofin</i>.</i> The reference<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>egrof</i> refers to something strong and hard.</i> is to something strong and hard. Rabbi Merinus says that the <i>alef</i> of <i>egrof</i> is superfluous. It is like the <i>alef</i> of <i>ezro’i</i> (my shoulder) (Job 31:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Which is superfluous.</i> It comes from the same root as <i>ge-rafam</i> (swept them away) (Jud. 5:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">The root of which is <i>gimmel, resh, peh</i>.</i> The reference is to something that one drags in one’s hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">A clod of earth. See I.E.’s short commentary.</i> The same is true in Arabic.

Verse 19

IF HE RISE AGAIN. We will rely on our sages of blessed memory who said that <i>al mishanto</i> (upon his staff) means that he supports himself and does not lean on others as sick people do.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>San</i>. 78b. Also see Rashi.</i>
THEN SHALL HE THAT SMOTE HIM BE QUIT. They shall release him from prison.
[LOSS OF HIS TIME.] <i>Shivto</i> (loss of his time) comes from the same root as <i>shevitah</i> (rest),<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>shin, bet, tav</i>.</i> for his work stopped.<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation, <i>shivto</i> means his work stoppage; i.e., he must reimburse him for his work stoppage.</i> This interpretation is correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">In view of the fact that he next offers a different explanation of <i>shivto</i>, I.E. must mean that this interpretation is grammatically defensible.</i> <i>Shivto</i> follows the paradigm of <i>shivro</i> (his corn money) (Gen. 44:2), for the <i>tav</i> is a root letter. It is possible that <i>shivto</i> comes from the same root as <i>shivtah</i> (tarried) in <i>save that she tarried a little in the house</i> (Ruth 2:7). <i>Shivtah</i> comes from the same root as the word <i>yashav</i> (sat).<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>yod, shin, bet</i>.</i> <i>Shivto</i> refers to the time that the one who was struck sat at home resting, without work. What proves that this interpretation is correct is that it is the reverse of <i>and walk abroad</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Which indicates that until then he could not walk abroad and had to stay home. The only difference between both definitions is in etymology.</i>
AND SHALL CAUSE HIM TO BE THOROUGHLY HEALED. This is a sign that permission has been granted to physicians to heal blows and wounds that are visible on the surface.<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Of the body.</i> However, it is in God’s hand to heal any illness which strikes inside of the body. It is thus written, <i>For He maketh sore, and bindeth up</i> (Job 5:18). Furthermore, Scripture tells us concerning King Asa, <i>yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians</i> (II Chron. 16:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Asa was stricken with an internal disease. The Bible rebukes Asa for seeking the help of physicians rather than the Lord’s.</i> Now Scripture distinguished between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Internal and external wounds.</i> It does not state, <i>verafo yirpe</i> (and he shall surely heal), which is in the <i>kal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">The simple active form. When God does the healing Scriptures employs the <i>kal</i> form. Cf. <i>refa</i> (heal) in Num. 12:13 and <i>erpa</i> (I will heal) in Deut. 32:39. The <i>kal</i> is employed because, when contrasted to the <i>pi’el</i> (see next note), it implies ease of effort (Weiser).</i> It rather reads, <i>ve-rappo yerappe</i> (and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed). The latter is in the <i>pi’el</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">The intensive form. The <i>pi’el</i> implies an expenditure of effort. Hence it is used when man does the healing.</i> I will explain this very well later on in this portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 23:25.</i> The rabbis received a tradition concerning other payments<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">Namely, compensation for damage, pain, and shame. See <i>Baba Kama</i> 83b.</i> in addition to the two<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">That is, healing and loss of time.</i> mentioned in our verse. They similarly received a tradition to include spices which are not stated in the Torah among the incense spices.<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud <i>Keritot</i> 6a, the incense consisted of 11 spices. However, only five spices are listed in Ex. 30:34.</i>

Verse 20

AND IF A MAN SMITE HIS BONDMAN. There is no doubt that according to Israelite jurisprudence the same ordinances that apply to a free man apply to a person sold into bondage. Hence it is impossible for the bondman<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in our verse.</i> to be a Hebrew servant.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">For the same law that applies to any Israelite would apply to him. Thus the law codified in verse 21 cannot relate to a Hebrew.</i> Furthermore, Scripture states at the end,<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Masoretic chapter, that is, verse 21.</i> <i>for he is his money</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">This cannot apply to an Israelite, for one Hebrew does not become the property of another Hebrew.</i> Now the bondman and bondwoman<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in our verse.</i> are the ones concerning whom Scripture writes, <i>of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids</i> (Lev. 25:44). The <i>bet</i> of <i>ba-shevet</i> (with a rod) is vocalized with a <i>pattach</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than with a <i>sheva</i>.</i> The reference is to the rod<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>bet</i> indicates a specific rod. According to I.E., <i>bashevet</i> (with a rod) should be rendered, with the rod, i.e., the rod which the master uses to chastise his servants.</i> which the master was in the habit of using to beat his servants. Now all those who dispute the words of our sages<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on the next verse.</i> are forced to agree with them with regard to the phrase <i>nakom yinnakem</i> (he shall surely be avenged),<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis, <i>nakom yinakkem</i> means: he shall be executed by the sword.</i> for vengeance takes many forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Thus were it not for Rabbinic tradition, we would not know what punishment to mete out to a master who kills his slave.</i> Now logic will not help them in this case.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">A logical and literal analysis of this verse will not tell us what punishment Scripture had in mind by <i>he shall surely be avenged</i>.</i> The fathers have received the tradition that <i>nakem yenakem</i> (he shall surely be avenged) is similar to <i>a sword that shall avenge</i> (nokemet) <i>the vengeance of the covenant</i> (nekam berit) (Lev. 26:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i>

Verse 21

NOTWITHSTANDING. Observe that the word <i>yukkam</i> (be punished),<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> which is a <i>hofal</i>, has the same meaning as <i>yinnakem</i> (be punished),<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Employed in the previous verse. As the former refers to execution so does the latter.</i> which is a <i>nifal</i>. The heretics<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. The printed texts have <i>kuthim</i> (Samaritans).</i> say that the meaning of <i>nakom yinnakem</i> (he shall surely be avenged) is that great vengeance shall be exacted, namely, that the master shall be beaten. However, if the bondman lives for a day, less vengeance shall be exacted. If he lives for two days no vengeance shall be taken. They argue<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, their proof is.</i> that we do not find the term vengeance used with reference to the death penalty inflicted by a law court. They also say, that there is no positive proof that <i>a sword that shall avenge</i> (Lev. 26:25) refers to being put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 20.</i> Furthermore, what need is there to say “two days” after saying “a day”?<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>nakom yinnakem</i> refers to execution, then why does Scripture say that if the slave lives for two days the master is not put to death? If the master is not put to death when the slave lives for one day, he is certainly not put to death if the slave lives for two days. However, if we speak of graded punishments, then it is logical to distinguish between the two.</i> However, their<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">The heretics.</i> real difficulty lies in accepting the idea that the master would be executed because of the death of a bondman. I will now answer them. Why didn’t Scripture specify what greater or lesser vengeance is to be exacted?<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">If, as the heretics claim, Scripture speaks of graded punishments, then it should have stated what these punishments consist of.</i> Let us now pursue what is written in Scripture. Scripture states, <i>nekom nikmat bene yisrael</i> (avenge the children of Israel) (Num. 31:2). It then goes on to tell us that all the Midianites were killed. Note that Samson said, <i>ki im nikkamti ba-khem</i> (surely I will be avenged of you) (Jud. 15:7). It then states, <i>And he smote them hip [and thigh with a great slaughter</i>] (Jud. 15:8). Samson said, <i>ve-innakemah nekam achat</i> (that I may be this once avenged) (Jud. 16:28) and they died in the house.<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the temple of Dagon.</i> Scripture states, <i>And a two-edged sword in their hand</i> (Ps. 149:6). It then goes on to say, <i>To execute vengeance</i> (nikamah) <i>upon the nations</i> (Ps. 149:7). The Bible states, <i>For he doth avenge</i> (yikkom) <i>the blood of his servants</i> (Deut. 32:43). Now blood indicates slaughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Thus to avenge the blood of his servants means to kill those who slaughtered his servants.</i> This is the way the term<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nekamah</i> (vengeance).</i> is always used. The reason Scripture here refers to execution by vengeance is that a master seeks excuses to fall upon his bondman because he is in his power,<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">The master thinks that the slave has no one to avenge him and thus abuses his slave. Hence Scripture states the death of an innocent slave must be avenged.</i> as he cannot smite a fellow Israelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">Who is his slave, for he fears the slave’s family who will avenge him.</i> Now let us turn to Scripture’s statement a <i>day or two</i>. Observe that the latter is like <i>At the mouth of two witnesses</i> [<i>or three witnesses</i>] (Deut. 17:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells us that capital cases require two or three witnesses. Now if two witnesses are sufficient to establish the fact, why mention three?</i> They<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">The above-noted heretics.</i> said that they do not know its meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Why Scripture reads, <i>or three witnesses</i>, if two witnesses are sufficient.</i> Let them put our verse along with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">As they do not understand the reason for <i>or three witnesses</i>, so do they not understand the reason for <i>or two</i> (days).</i> Our sages of blessed memory said that the meaning of <i>a day or two</i> is that the hours shall add up to the twenty-four of a day.<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Mekhilta</i> on this verse: “A <i>day</i> means one that is as long as two days, and <i>two</i> means two days that are as long as one. How so? A twenty-four hour period.” Also see Rashi: “A day which is made up of a part of two separate days, i.e. twenty-four hours calculated from any moment” (Rashi, paraphrased by Cohen).</i> Now when we examined the verse we found that Scripture says, “with the rod,”<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">This is the literal meaning of <i>ba-shevet</i>. See note 213.</i> the reference being to the disciplining rod, as in <i>Thou beatest him with the rod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ba-shevet</i>.</i> (Prov. 23:14). It is thus clear that the master wanted to punish the bondman. Scripture did not mention what the laws are regarding a master who kills his bondman,<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">When not disciplining him. According to Rashbam the master is put to death in such cases even if the servant lives beyond two days.</i> because a master normally takes pity on the bondman, whom he owns, and refrains from killing him even as he takes pity upon his cattle. Now God commanded that a master shall not act sadistically when he punishes his bondman. When he sees the bondman dying under his rod the master shall let him be. If he does not leave the bondman alone then he will be put to death on the bondman’s account, for God’s mercy is upon all of His creatures. Indeed, concerning David we read, <i>Thou hast shed blood abundantly</i> (I Chron. 22:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">The reason David was not permitted to build the temple.</i> The reference was to non-Israelite blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the blood of all people is precious in the sight of God.</i>

Verse 22

AND IF MEN STRIVE<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>yinnatzu</i>.</i> TOGETHER. The reference is to Hebrew men<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Men</i> means Hebrew men.</i> who strive together and hit each other. Scripture similarly reads, <i>Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow</i>? (Ex. 2:13)<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">Moses said this to <i>two men of the Hebrews</i> [who] <i>were striving</i> (nitzim) <i>together</i> (Ex. 12:13). Now <i>nitzim</i> and <i>yinnatzu</i> (the word used for strive in our verse) come from the same root. We thus see that the Hebrew word <i>yinnatzu</i> (strive) means to exchange blows (Filwarg).</i>
AND HURT. Both are included.<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">Both men hurt the woman. <i>Ve-nagefu</i> (hurt) is in the plural. Its literal meaning is, and they hurt.

Verse 23

BUT IF ANY HARM FOLLOW. To the woman. We find a difference of opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning the punishment of the one who is responsible for the woman’s death. See <i>Mekhilta</i> on this verse: <i>“Then thou shalt give life for life</i>. He cannot pay for life with money. It is with life that he must pay for life…Rabbi says: <i>Then thou shalt give life for life</i>. This means monetary compensation.” Also see <i>San</i>. 79a.</i> Some say that the one who caused the women’s death is put to death because he intended to kill a fellow Israelite. They offer as proof the fact that Scripture states, <i>he shall surely be fined</i> (v. 22) with regard to the children, but it states with regard to the woman, <i>then thou shalt give life for life</i>. Now if the reference is to a fine,<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">That is, if <i>then thou shalt give life for life</i> refers to a fine.</i> then in what way is the woman’s death worse than that of the children? On the other hand, if we say that one is to be punished with death for killing the children, why did Scripture alter its style<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">When dealing with the death of the woman.</i> and read, <i>life for life</i>? The opposing opinion maintains that one who intends to kill one individual and kills another is not put to death, and the reason the Torah altered its language and stated <i>life for life</i> is that the fine for killing a person is much greater than that for killing an embryo. They offer as proof the fact that the Torah afterwards reads, <i>eye for eye, tooth for tooth</i> (v. 24). The latter is not to be taken literally. On the contrary, it refers to ransom.<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">The culprit pays ransom for his tooth or eye. Thus as <i>eye for eye, tooth for tooth</i> refers to money, so does <i>life for life</i> in this case.</i> This portion<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And if man strive together</i>, etc., verses 22-25.</i> was written because of the clause <i>eye for eye, tooth for tooth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">The laws dealing with murder were dealt with in verse 14.</i> Scripture afterwards codifies the law dealing with the eye and tooth of a bondman.<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture first wanted to lay down the law dealing with one who takes out the eye or tooth of a free person before it went on to deal with the law regarding one who takes out the eye or tooth of a slave.</i>

Verse 24

EYE. Rabbi Saadiah says that we cannot interpret this verse according to its plain meaning. For if a man struck his neighbor’s eye and the eye lost a third of its sight, how is it possible to punish the culprit with an equivalent blow, that is, with a blow which is neither greater nor lesser?<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">Than the blow which the culprit inflicted upon his victim.</i> There is a possibility that the culprit will lose his entire eyesight. Burns, wounds, and stripes present even greater difficulties, for if they were inflicted on a dangerous area it is possible for the culprit to die. The mind cannot accept this.<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>eye for eye</i> be taken literally.</i> Ben Zuta<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 2:2 and the notes thereto.</i> said to Saadiah Gaon: Does not Scripture elsewhere state, <i>as he hath maimed a man, so shall it be rendered unto him</i> (Lev. 24:20)? Rabbi Saadiah answered him: We have a <i>bet</i> taking the place of the word <i>al</i> (on).<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">There are verses in Scripture in which Scripture employs the word <i>al</i>. However, it is to be interpreted as a <i>bet</i>. For example, Scripture states, <i>lo ragal al lishono</i> (Ps. 15:3). Its literal reading is: He did not slander upon (<i>al</i>) his tongue (<i>leshono</i>). However, it should be interpreted: He did not slander with his tongue (<i>bi-leshono</i>).</i> Its meaning is, so shall a fine be placed upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 24:40 reads: <i>ken yinaten bo</i> (so shall it be rendered unto him). According to Saadiah Gaon, <i>ken yinaten bo</i> should be interpreted as if written, <i>ken yinaten alav</i> (so shall it be placed upon him); i.e., he is to be fined accordingly. For just as a <i>bet</i> takes the place of <i>al, al</i> (alav) takes the place of a <i>bet</i> (bo).</i> However, Ben Zuta responded, <i>as he hath done, so shall it be done to him</i> (Lev. 24:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Which implies tit for tat.</i> The Gaon retorted: Observe, Samson said, <i>As they did unto me, so have I done unto them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">The Philistines.</i> (Jud. 15:11). Now Samson did not take their wives and hand them over to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">Which is what the Philistines did to him. Hence it is also possible that <i>as he hath done, so shall it be done to him</i> (Lev. 24:19) is not to be taken literally.</i> He only repaid them for their dastardly acts. Ben Zuta responded: If the culprit<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">Who injures another person and knocks out his eye.</i> is a poor man what shall his punishment be? The Gaon answered: If a blind person shall blind one who can see, what shall be done to him, for it is possible for a poor person to become wealthy and pay. However, it is eternally impossible for the blind to pay.<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the blind man can never regain his eyesight so that the punishment of blinding him can be exacted.</i> The general rule is that we cannot fully explain any commandment written in the Torah unless we rely on the words of our sages of blessed memory. Just as we received the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">The written law.</i> from the sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the fathers. I.E. occasionally refers to the sages as fathers. Cf. the Talmudic tractate <i>Ethics of the Fathers</i>.</i> so did we receive the Oral Law.<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">From them.</i> There is no difference between them. Now the interpretation of <i>eye for eye</i> is, it is fitting for the culprit to give his eye in place of his victim’s eye if he does not pay ransom for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">He deserves to have his eye taken out. However, Scripture substituted a monetary payment.</i>
[TOOTH FOR TOOTH, HAND FOR HAND, FOOT FOR FOOT.] Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says: In some cases the payment for taking out a tooth is very small.<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture mentions this law.</i> This is the case when a youth is struck, because if his tooth is uprooted another will take its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">Nevertheless, the one who takes it out must pay for it.</i> Scripture mentions the hand because one does work with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">Thus one might suppose that a greater penalty would be inflicted for harming it.</i> Scripture mentions the foot because the loss of a foot is worse than the loss of a hand, as a person cannot walk on one foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">Thus one might suppose that a greater penalty, i.e., more than just monetary compensation, would be inflicted for harming it.</i> However, I believe that Scripture mentions these organs because they are the ones that are usually harmed. When a man strikes his neighbor he strikes him in the eye which faces him, or the mouth which faces him and thus breaks his teeth, or in the hand that his neighbor fights with or protects his face with, or his foot when he runs away from him.

Verse 25

BURN. <i>Keviyyah</i> (bum) is to be taken at face value; that is, it refers to a burn caused by fire. 
Some say that <i>petza</i> (wound) refers to a bleeding wound and <i>chabburah</i> (stripe) to a blow that does not draw blood. However, the Gaon says that <i>petza</i> refers to breaking a bone and <i>chabburah</i> to a bleeding wound.

Verse 26

AND IF A MAN SMITE. God commanded that a bondman should go free because of his eye or tooth to prevent masters from cruelly striking their servants with terrible blows. Thus if the master destroys his bondman’s eye or even his tooth, then the bondman will pass from his control free of charge and the master will forfeit his property.

Verse 27

AND IF HE SMITE OUT HIS BONDMAN’S TOOTH. Scripture, as I have noted, speaks about the most usual. According to tradition a bondman similarly goes free if any of his major organs<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">The major external organs, which consist of the fingers and toes, the ears, the nose, the tip of the penis in a male and the nipples in a female. See <i>Nega’im</i> 6:7; <i>Kiddushin</i> 25a.</i> are destroyed.

Verse 28

AND IF AN OX GORE A MAN. This portion<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 28-31.</i> is mentioned because of <i>if the ox gore a bondman or a bondwoman</i> (v. 32).<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture up to now dealt with injuries to slaves, it wanted to go on and codify the law dealing with an ox that gores a bondman or a bond-woman. However, before dealing with the latter it wanted to state the law dealing with an ox that gores an Israelite.</i> The man and the woman referred to in our verse are Israelites. Our verse reads, <i>or a woman</i>. Scripture does not mention a woman in <i>He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth</i> (v. 12) because it is the manner of Scripture to mention the more important, namely, the male. Nevertheless, the same law applies to a female.<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">A person who murders a woman is put to death.</i> Scripture now mentions a woman<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">That is, our verse reads, <i>or a woman</i>.</i> so that the owner of the ox does not protest and argue that the woman did not follow the normal practice. For there are places where it is not the custom for women to go out of the city to a field where oxen are found. It is because of this that Scripture afterwards states, <i>Whether it have gored a son, or gored a daughter</i> (v. 31). The law concerning one that smiteth a man applies equally whether the victim is an adult or a minor. Scripture mentions son or a daughter so that the owner of the ox does not protest against the parents and say that the parents should have watched their children.
THE OX SHALL BE SURELY STONED. The meaning of <i>and its flesh shall not be eaten</i> is that its flesh shall not be eaten as the flesh of an animal that dies of itself, which the stranger in the gate or the foreigner may eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And its flesh shall not be eaten</i> may be mistakenly taken to imply that the flesh of other oxen not killed by <i>shechitah</i> (ritual slaughtering) is permitted to be eaten by Israelites. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Our sages said that every time Scripture states, <i>it shall not he eaten</i>, it means that it is prohibited to derive any pleasure from it.
BUT THE OWNER OF THE OX SHALL BE QUIT. Of punishment.

Verse 29

BUT IF THE OX WAS WONT TO GORE. There is no doubt that there is no ransom for those who are to be executed by a court of law.<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 35:31: <i>Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death</i>.</i> The transmitters of tradition therefore said that <i>shall also be put to death</i> refers to death at the hands of heaven. Now I believe that here [the term <i>shall be put to death</i>] is similar to <i>eye for eye</i>. Its meaning is, the owner shall be put to death if he does not give a redemption for his life. All of this because Scripture reads, <i>yumat</i> (shall be put to death); not <i>yamut</i> (he will die).<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., the term <i>yumat</i> always means that others shall put him to death. However, <i>yamut</i> always refers to death at the hands of heaven. Since Scripture here uses <i>yumat</i>, the reference cannot be to death at the hands of heaven (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 30

IF THERE BE LAID ON HIM A RANSOM. This does not contradict <i>Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer</i> (Num. 35:31), for Scripture speaks there of a real murderer. However, the person spoken of in our verse did not commit murder. He is only punished because he did not restrain the ox by tying it up. Or, if he tied the ox up, he did not do so properly so that the ox was able to free itself. Or, the ox did not find the door<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">Of the bam or corral.</i> closed<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the owner left the bam door open.</i> and it went out and caused damage.
LAID UPON HIM. By the decree of the judges.

Verse 31

WHETHER IT HAVE GORED A SON, OR HAVE GORED A DAUGHTER. Both of whom are Israelites, for Scripture afterwards reads, <i>If the ox gore a bondman</i> (v. 32). God decreed that the owner of the ox<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote">Even though he personally did not directly kill.</i> be punished because it is hard for God to see an animal kill a person who is created in the image of God. Because of this, the ox is also stoned.

Verse 32



Verse 33

AND IF A MAN SHALL OPEN A PIT. Which was dug.<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a pit which was dug and then covered.</i> Scripture mentions this because God does not want an animal to die in vain, that is, if its death does not serve human needs. Furthermore, he<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">The one who opens the pit.</i> injures the owner of the beast.

Verse 34

THE OWNER OF THE PIT. The one who opened it or the one who dug it. This is the law even though the pit is on public property.<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">And does not belong to the one who opened or dug it.</i> He made it for his use; therefore he is called the owner of the pit.
HE SHALL GIVE MONEY. He shall pay what the fallen animal was worth when alive after deducting the value of the carcass.

Verse 35

AND IF ONE MAN’S OX HURT ANOTHER’S. Ben Zuta says that <i>re’ehu</i> (another’s)<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, his neighbor.</i> is an adjective describing the ox.<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ben Zuta (a Karaite exegete) our verse should be rendered: And if a man’s ox hurt an ox his neighbor (<i>re’ehu</i>), i.e., the ox , who is his neighbor.</i> However, Ben Zuta did not notice that the word <i>shor</i> (ox) is in the construct with <i>ish</i> (man’s).<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">Its literal meaning is, a man’s ox.</i> This is also the case with the word <i>shor</i> (ox) and <i>re’ehu</i> (another’s).<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that <i>shor re’ehu</i> is parallel to <i>shor ish</i>, which literally means a man’s ox. Hence <i>shor re’ehu</i> must similarly mean a neighbor’s ox.</i> However, an ox has no neighbor except for Ben Zuta.<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">For the term <i>re’a</i> (neighbor) only refers to a fellow human being.</i> The owner of a tame ox pays half of the damage.

Verse 36

OR IF IT BE KNOWN. On the other hand, if the ox was a gorer he shall pay the entire damage. Scripture mentions the laws dealing with the ox up to <i>If a man steal an ox</i> (v. 37).<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">That is, starting with verse 28 and ending with verse 37.</i> All of this<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture found it necessary to codify here the laws contained in verses 28-37.</i> because of the bondman who is sold<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">By the law courts.</i> because of his theft. This is the way our Torah portion opened, namely, <i>If thou buy a Hebrew servant</i> (v. 2).<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">The slave spoken of in verse 2 is a slave sold by the law courts for theft.</i>

Verse 37

IF A MAN STEAL. Rabbi Joshua says that God was stricter with an ox than with a sheep because the thief cannot hide an ox as he can a sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">Since one has to be more of a professional thief to steal the ox, the fine is heavier.</i> One cannot steal it unless one is experienced in the art of theft.<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the thief is punished more severely.</i> However, Saadiah Gaon says that the theft of an ox is more severely punished because the owner of the ox suffers more than that of a sheep because the ox is used for plowing.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

IF A THIEF BE FOUND BREAKING IN. At night, as the thief would not break in during the day. <i>If the sun he risen upon him</i> in the verse which follows proves this.
[THERE SHALL BE NO BLOODGUILTINESS FOR HIM.] That is, the one who kills the thief is not guilty of bloodshed.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>damim</i> (literally, blood) means bloodshed. Hence <i>en lo damim</i> (there shall be no bloodguiltiness in him) means he is not guilty of bloodshed.</i> One has to be amazed at those who interpret <i>damim</i> (bloodguiltiness) as life.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Rashi. Rashi interprets <i>en lo damim</i> (there shall be no bloodguiltiness in him): “This is not murder. He is considered as dead to begin with.” Also see Rashi on verse 2. “<i>Damim lo</i> (there shall be bloodguiltiness for him): He is considered as a living person, and the owner of the house commits murder if he kills him.”</i> If this is so, what is the meaning of <i>because thou art a man of blood</i> (damim) (II Sam. 16:8) and <i>his blood</i> (damav) <i>shall be upon him</i> (Lev. 20:9).

Verse 2

IF THE SUN BE RISEN UPON HIM…HE SHALL MAKE RESTITUTION. This<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>He shall make restitution</i>.</i> refers to <i>he shall pay five oxen for an ox</i>, etc. (Ex. 21:37), which is written above.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For the first part of our verse does not deal with what a thief steals. It deals rather with the circumstances under which an owner may kill a thief (Krinsky).</i> It is like <i>unto a foreign people</i> (Ex. 21:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Which is connected to the first part of verse 8. See I.E. on Ex. 21:7,8.</i> and <i>And also unto thy bondwoman thou shalt do likewise</i> (Deut. 15:17), which refers to <i>thou shalt furnish him liberally</i> (Deut. 15:14), which is written above it.
HE SHALL BE SOLD FOR HIS THEFT. Because of his theft.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that the <i>bet</i> prefaced to <i>genevato</i> (his theft) means because. Thus <i>bi-genevato</i> means because of his theft. The <i>bet</i> prefaced to a word usually means in. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 3

IF THE THEFT BE FOUND IN HIS HAND. This verse refers to all beasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Not only to an ox, ass, or sheep.</i> Our sages<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads: however, our sages, etc.</i> received a tradition that Scripture decrees<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>gezerat ha-katuv</i>.</i> that the law concerning the payment of “four and five” applies only to oxen and sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Baba Kama</i> 67b.</i>

Verse 4

IF A MAN CAUSE A FIELD OR A VINEYARD TO BE EATEN. This too is connected to what is written above<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Ex. 21:28-36.</i> wherein the damage cause by an ox is mentioned. Scripture reads, <i>ki yaver</i> (if…cause…to be eaten). The word <i>yaver</i> (cause to be eaten) comes from the same root as <i>be’irenu</i> (our cattle) in <i>we and our cattle</i> (Num. 22:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>ki yaver ish</i> means if a man sends his beast, i.e., he sends his beast to pasture. Indeed, this is how I.E. renders <i>yaver</i> in his short commentary. Similarly Rashi on verse 4.</i> It<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is apparently to <i>yaver</i> (Krinsky, Weiser). However, see next note.</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yaver</i>, as I.E. points out in his short commentary, is a <i>hifil</i>. Some believe that our text is corrupt and that we should emend it accordingly. See Krinsky and Weiser. However, according to Filwarg, I.E.’s comment refers to <i>bi’er</i> (feed), which is the <i>pi’el</i>.</i>
[AND IT FEED IN ANOTHER MAN’S FIELD.] <i>Bi-sedeh acker</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, in another field. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> means in another man’s field.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In another field is short for in another man’s field.</i> <i>Ye that have eaten up the vineyard</i> (Is. 3:4)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ye that have eaten up the vineyard</i> means ye have eaten up the vineyard which belongs to another.</i> is similar.

Verse 5

IF FIRE BREAK OUT. This too is connected to what is written above, for it speaks of damage caused to a field.
[HE THAT KINDLED.] The word <i>ha-mavir</i> (he that kindled) does not have the same meaning as the word <i>yaver</i> (cause to be eaten) in <i>if a man cause…to be eaten</i> (v. 4) even though they both come from the same conjugation.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mavir</i> and <i>yaver</i> are both <i>hifils</i>.</i> For the word fire indicates what <i>ha-mavir</i> means.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse opens with <i>If fire break out</i>. It then goes on to say that the <i>“mavir” shall surely make restitution</i>. It is thus clear that <i>ha-mavir</i> means <i>he that kindled</i> [the fire].</i> It is considered beautiful Hebrew style to employ the same word with two meanings,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In one verse or passage.</i> as in <i>With the jawbone of an ass</i> (ha-chamor), <i>heaps upon heaps</i> (chamor chamorotayim) (Jud. 15:16), and in <i>that rode on thirty ass colts</i> (ayarim), <i>and they had thirty cities</i> (u-sheloshim ayarim lahem) (Jud. 10:4). Now in the latter verse the second <i>ayarim</i> means cities, as <i>which are called Havvoth-jair</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>) proves.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Jud. 10:4 reads: <i>And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts</i> (ayarim), <i>and they had thirty cities</i> (ayarim), <i>which are called Havvoth-jair</i> (the villages of Jair) <i>unto this day</i>. It is highly unlikely that <i>which are called Havvoth-jair</i> refers to ass colts.</i>

Verse 6

IF A MAN DELIVERS. This is also connected to what is written above.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The above verses 1-3 dealing with theft.</i> Scripture speaks of theft so as to complete the ordinances concerning theft.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Begun in the earlier verse.</i>

Verse 7

WHETHER HE HAVE NOT PUT HIS HAND UNTO HIS NEIGHBOR’S GOODS. This indicates that <i>then the master of the house shall come near unto God</i> refers to an oath sworn before judges.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods</i> indicates an oath; i.e., <i>then the master of the house shall come near unto God…</i>[and shall swear] <i>whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods</i>. So too Rashi.</i> Hence, <i>For every matter of trespass</i> (v. 8) follows. This means that the one who swore sinned.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">That is, swore falsely (see Rashi). Since the previous verse deals with an oath taken by the bailee, the verse that follows deals with instances where the bailee commits perjury.</i> Rabbi Joshua says that <i>pesha</i> (trespass) means that it went out of the owner’s possession, as in “Then did Edom revolt from under the hand of Judah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">There is no such verse. II Kings 8:22 literally reads: “Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah…Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.” I.E. probably quoted from memory and erred.</i> (II Kings 8:22). <i>For every matter of trespass</i> (v. 8) includes everything that follows<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">That is, oxen, asses, sheep, or raiment.</i> and everything<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Else.</i> that passes out of the owner’s possession,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase, <i>For every manner of trespass</i>.</i> whether stolen<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This is implied in <i>every manner of trespass</i>.</i> or lost,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Explicitly mentioned in our verse.</i> with the finder denying and not admitting that he found it.

Verse 8

WHEREOF ONE SAITH. The witness saith, <i>This is it</i>.
THIS IS IT…HE WHOM GOD SHALL CONDEMN. If God<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the judge.</i> shall condemn the keeper, because he himself stole it, or one who found an object and denied finding it, and thus became a thief because of it.

Verse 9

IF A MAN DELIVER. Our verse speaks of a paid bailee.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">A bailee, or keeper, who is paid for his services. This bailee is obligated to pay if what is placed in his charge is stolen or torn. See verse 11.</i>

Verse 10

UNTO HIS NEIGHBOR’S GOODS. <i>According to the pace of the cattle</i> (Gen. 33:14.) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Melekhet</i> (goods) is similar to the word <i>melakhah</i> (cattle) in <i>According to the pace of the cattle</i>. The word <i>melakhah</i> literally means work. Hence I.E.’s comment that it sometimes connotes goods, property, or anything that is one’s “work.” See I.E. on Gen. 33:14.</i> The owner takes nothing from the keeper except for the oath.

Verse 11



Verse 12

IF IT BE TORN IN PIECES. He was paid for this.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">He was paid to make sure this did not happen.</i>
LET HIM BRING IT FOR WITNESS. Let him bring a piece of the carcass as proof. This is in line with <i>As a shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion, Two legs, or a piece of an ear</i> (Amos 3:12).

Verse 13

AND IF A MAN BORROW AUGHT. According to the plain meaning of the text, <i>the owner thereof not being with it</i> means that the owner can claim that the borrower overworked his animal.

Verse 14

IF THE OWNER THEREOF BE WITH IT. If the owner himself saw how the animal was hurt or died.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The bailee does not have to pay for the animal, for the owner would not have permitted the bailee to overwork his animal.</i> The same law applies to a hired animal accompanied on the way by its lessee and lessor.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretion of <i>im sachir hu ba bi-secharo</i> (if it be a hireling he loseth his hire) as: if a hired animal, while being accompanied by its lessee and lessor, was hurt or died, the lessee is not obligated to pay.

Verse 15

THAT IS NOT BETROTHED. For a betrothed woman is considered to be married<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">And the one who sleeps with her is punished by death. See Deut. 22:24.</i> even though she has not slept with her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbinic tradition there are two stages to marriage, <i>erusin</i> (betrothal) and <i>kiddushin</i> (sanctification). In the first stage the woman lives with her parents and is prohibited from having intercourse with her husband. In the second stage the women leaves her parent’s home and takes up her domicile with her husband. In contemporary times the <i>erusin</i> and <i>kiddushin</i> take place at the same time. A woman who is an <i>arusah</i> is considered to be married even though she still lives with her parents. Thus a “betrothed woman” in Scripture does not refer to an engaged woman; it refers to a married woman.</i>
[HE SHALL SURELY PAY A DOWRY FOR HER.] <i>Mahor yimharennah</i> (he shall surely pay a dowry for her) is similar to the word <i>mohar</i> used in the sense of attachment, as in <i>acher maharu</i> (that attach themselves unto another)<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. According to I.E., <i>mahor yimharennah</i> (he shall surely pay a dowry for her) is to be rendered: he shall surely attach himself to her; that is, he must marry her.</i> (Ps. 16:4). The root <i>mem, heh, resh</i> having the meaning of quickly (<i>meherah</i>) is only found in the <i>pi’el</i> in all of Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas <i>mahor yimharennah</i> is in the <i>kal</i>.</i>

Verse 16

HE SHALL PAY MONEY. For seducing her.

Verse 17

A SORCERESS. Scripture mentions the law of the sorceress after the law dealing with a seduced virgin because those who lust desire to satisfy their cravings through magic.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">By bewitching in one way or another the objects of their desire.</i> Scripture speaks of a sorceress because women practice sorcery more than men.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The same law applies to a sorcerer. However, Scripture speaks of what is most usual.</i>

Verse 18

WHOSOEVER LIETH WITH A BEAST. Scripture first mentions the laws dealing with the seduction of an immature young woman. It also mentions intercourse with an animal that, unlike a woman, cannot cry for help. It then mentions<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 22:24-27.</i> the law concerning a woman who can cry for help.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">If raped.</i>

Verse 19

HE THAT SACRIFICETH UNTO THE GODS. According to the plain meaning of the text the verse does not speak of an Israelite, for Scripture already warned against this in the second statement.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Decalogue, viz., <i>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</i> (Ex. 20:3).</i> It is only mentioned because of the stranger who is mentioned in the next verse. It is because of the stranger<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Some texts read, for it is on account.</i> that Scripture reads, <i>Whosoever lieth with a beast</i> (v. 18), for this is the manner of the foreign nations. Now a stranger may live in the Land of Israel on the following conditions: that he does not lie with a beast and that he does not sacrifice unto idols. Scripture reads, <i>la-elohim</i> (unto the gods) because the reference is to the gods that the stranger was previously accustomed to worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>lamed</i> indicates the definite article, namely, the gods that the stranger was accustomed to worship.</i> The term <i>la-elohim</i> (the gods) also takes in the angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">For the term <i>elohim</i> also refers to angels.</i>
UNTO THE LORD ONLY. Only unto the glorious name<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YHVH</i>.</i> which is a common noun not used for any other being.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">May one offer sacrifices.</i>

Verse 20

AND A STRANGER. When a stranger commits himself not to worship idols you shall not wrong him in your country because you are more powerful than he is. Remember that you were strangers like him. When Scripture makes mention of the stranger who is powerless, it similarly takes note of the orphan and widow who are powerless Israelites. After saying <i>lo te’annun</i> (ye shall not afflict) (v. 21) which is in the plural, Scripture says <i>im te’anneh</i> (if thou afflict) (v. 22)<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Which is the singular.</i> because whoever sees a person afflicting the orphan and the widow and does not aid them, is also considered an afflicter.

Verse 21



Verse 22

IF THOU AFFLICT THEM. Note the punishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">For afflicting a widow or orphan.</i> If a person afflicts an orphan or a widow and no one comes to their aid, all are punished. The next verse therefore reads, <i>My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you</i>, that is, all of you. Scripture says, “for if he cry at all unto me”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> in regard to the orphan. The same applies to a widow. However, it is possible that the orphan is very young and cannot articulate his pain like the widow.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">That is, he can only cry out.</i>

Verse 23



Verse 24

IF THOU LEND MONEY. If the Lord gave you enough wealth so that you are able to lend to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>If thou lend</i> implies that lending money to the poor is not an obligation. However, it is clear from Deut. 15:7-11 that one is obligated to lend money to the poor. Hence I.E. points out that one is obligated to lend money only if one has money to lend.</i> This section<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 21-23.</i> is mentioned here because the poor are like the stranger, the orphan, and the widow.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In that they are defenseless.</i> God calls the poor <i>My people</i> because the pious do not seek to acquire wealth in this world, as can be seen from Elijah’s behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells us that Elijah was <i>girt with a girdle of leather about his loins</i> (II Kings 1:8) and fed by ravens (I Kings 17:6). This, and the general description of Elijah’s life in Scripture, led I.E. to conclude that Elijah was poor.</i> Elisha, who did not want to accept Naaman’s gift (II Kings 5:16), also proves this point.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">For money was not important to Elisha.</i> So does Samuel from Ramah.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Who did not use his position to gather wealth. See I Sam. 12:3.</i>
[WITH THEE.] Its meaning is, in the place where you dwell.
THOU SHALT NOT BE TO HIM AS A CREDITOR. In that he favors you because of your kindness. Scripture reads, <i>tesimun</i> (shall ye lay) because the lender, the scribe, and the witnesses all violate the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tesimun</i> is a plural. Hence I.E.’s comment. According to the Talmud the borrower also violates the law. See <i>Baba Metzia</i> 75b. I.E. apparently held that according to the plain meaning of Scripture the borrower is not included, for <i>tisimun</i> cannot apply to him.</i>

Verse 25

IF THOU AT ALL TAKE THY NEIGHBOR’S GARMENT TO PLEDGE. After saying <i>salmat re’ekha</i> (thy neighbor’s garment), which is the feminine,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>salmat</i> is in the feminine.</i> and similarly, after saying, <i>ki hi kesuto levaddah</i> (for that is his only covering) (v. 26).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kesuto</i> (his covering) is in the feminine. Actually, <i>ki hi kesuto levaddah</i> follows <i>teshivennu</i>.</i> Scripture says, <i>teshivennu</i> (thou shalt restore it).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teshivennu</i> is masculine. Scripture should have used <i>teshevennah</i> since both <i>salmat</i> and <i>kesut</i> are feminine nouns.</i> Scripture reads <i>teshivennu</i> because it refers to the pledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chavul</i> (pledge) is masculine. <i>Teshivennu</i> (thou shalt restore it) does not mean thou shalt return the garment but rather thou shalt return the pledge (see previous note). It should be noted that the noun <i>chavul</i> is not explicitly stated in the verse but is implied in the verbs <i>chavol tachbol</i> (take to pledge).</i> Saadiah Gaon asks, what reason is there to take the pledge during the day and to return it at night? He answers, because the lender fears that the borrower might secure an additional loan from someone else and give him the pledge as security for the loan.

Verse 26

FOR THAT IS HIS ONLY COVERING. Its meaning is, you should pity him.
[FOR I AM GRACIOUS.] According to the Gaon the term <i>chanun</i> (gracious) is similar in meaning to <i>channuni channuni</i> (Have pity upon me, have pity on me) (Job 19:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah the word <i>chanun</i> means gracious. Thus Job 19:21 should be rendered: be gracious to me, be gracious to me.</i> Its meaning is, I will give him money and take away your money. I believe that this is not the meaning of <i>chaninah</i> (graciousness). What did David seek in saying, <i>Be gracious unto me, O God. according to Thy mercy</i> (Ps. 51:3)?<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The context makes it clear that David was not seeking a monetary gift from God.</i> <i>Chanun</i> rather has the same meaning as the word <i>rachum</i> (merciful) although there is a difference between them,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">In nuance.</i> as I will note in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i>. 
Now the phrase <i>that I will hear</i> which follows <i>and it shall come to pass, when He crieth unto Me</i> is similar to <i>for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry — My wrath shall wax hot</i> (v. 22,23).<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells us that when the orphan shall cry unto God, the Lord will hear his cry. It does not state what will happen next. I.E. thus points out that what follows <i>I will surely hear their cry</i> in verse 22 also applies here, viz., <i>My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless</i> (v. 23).</i> How shall you know that <i>I will surely hear their cry?</i> You will know it from <i>My wrath</i> which follows.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 23.</i>

Verse 27

THOU SHALT NOT REVILE<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>tekalel</i>.</i> GOD. The reference is to the judges,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elohim</i> (God) means judges. Thus, <i>Thou shalt not revile God</i>, means thou shalt not revile a judge or judges.</i> namely, the priests, the sons of Levi, who have the Torah with them. NOR CURSE<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ta’or</i>.</i> 
A RULER OF THY PEOPLE. In secret or in public. The Geonim differentiated between revile and curse.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">See notes 73 and 75. <i>Kelalah</i> refers to an insult, <i>me’erah</i> (curse) refers to a defect in a person’s body or fortune (Weiser).</i> The ruler spoken of in our verse is the king noted in Deuteronomy. When we examined all the verses that come one after the other until <i>And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed</i> (Ex. 23:13), we discovered that most of them deal with the poor. They appear to be connected to the section <i>If thou lend money…to the poor</i> (v. 24). Yefet says the reason Scripture mentions <i>Thou shalt not revile God</i> is that if the lender should violate the law and not return the pledge,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">At night.</i> the poor man, while in pain during the night, might revile the judge who ruled that the lender should take the pledge.

Verse 28

THE FULNESS OF THY HARVEST, AND OF THE OUTFLOW OF THY PRESSES. <i>Mele’atekha</i> (the fulness of thy harvest) is another name for wine and <i>dimakha</i> (the outflow)<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, weeping, or trickling.</i> another name for oil. However, Saadiah Gaon says that <i>mele’atekha</i> refers to both the fullness of the seed and the fullness of the winepress. He says that <i>dimakha</i> alludes to oil, because when an olive is pressed the oil drips like a tear (<i>dema</i>). Now this verse is explained elsewhere, namely, <i>The first-fruits of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep</i> (Deut. 18:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 18:4 is parallel to our verse and indicates that our verse deals with the first fruits.</i> Scripture therefore couples <i>The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me</i> with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it follows the law dealing with the first fruits of the fullness of the harvest and the outflow of the presses.</i> For the first-born are the first of one’s strength.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">They are thus similar to the first fruits.</i> Ben Zuta says that <i>mele’atekha</i> (the fulness of thy harvest) refers to pregnancy and <i>dimakha</i> (the outflow of the press) is another term for sperm, which is a drop. He also says that <i>Thou shalt not delay</i> means that one should not delay taking a wife. Hence, <i>The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me</i> follows it. However, this is sheer insanity. Why did Scripture mention <i>mele’atekha</i> before <i>dimakha</i>? According to Ben Zuta, <i>dimakha</i> refers to the ejaculation of semen into a woman, which is then followed by pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy is not in the hand of man. It depends only upon God.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ben Zuta our verse commands a man to marry and have children, viz., <i>The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me</i>. I.E. claims that there cannot be a command to have children, for while a man can marry and attempt to have children, there is no guarantee that he will. See I.E. on Gen. 1:22 and the notes thereto.</i> Yefet says that this verse is mentioned so that the poor person does not delay to give that which he is obligated to give.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, this verse is addressed to the poor. Yefet comments thus because most of our verses deal with the poor. See I.E.’s notes on the previous verse.</i> SHALT THOU DO WITH THINE OXEN, AND WITH THY SHEEP.] Likewise thou shalt give the first-born<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Of <i>thine oxen</i> and <i>thy</i> sheep.</i> to the priest.

Verse 29



Verse 30

AND YE SHALL BE HOLY MEN UNTO ME. Since Scripture mentions <i>thine oxen</i> and <i>thy sheep</i>, which are permitted to be eaten, it warns one not to eat meat which is torn, for it is possible that a poor person might eat torn meat because of his poverty.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. comments thus because most of our verse deals with the poor. See I.E.’s note on verse 27.</i>
[IN THE FIELD.] Scripture speaks of what is most common. The same law applies if the animal was torn in the midst of a city. <i>That chanceth him by night</i> (Deut. 23:11)<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to a seminal emission.</i> is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture speaks of a nocturnal emission because that is when most involuntary emissions take place. However, the same law applies to an emission that occurs during the day.</i>
[TO THE DOGS.]<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to the dog.</i> The <i>lamed</i> prefaced to <i>kelev</i> (dogs) was vocalized with a <i>pattach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than with a <i>sheva</i>.</i> because the reference is to the dog who guards the oxen and the flock.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>lamed</i> indicates the definite article.</i> Torn meat is not fit for anyone, only for a dog Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that torn meat is unhealthier than meat from an animal that dies of natural causes. There is something poison-like in torn meat that is harmful to the health of a human being. Hence Scripture does not permit one to give torn meat <i>unto the stranger that is within thy gates</i> (Deut. 14:21) or to <i>sell it unto a foreigner</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) as it does to meat from an animal that dies of natural causes (<i>Ibid</i>.).

Chapter 23



Verse 1

THOU SHALT NOT UTTER A FALSE REPORT. One should not invent fantasies in order to spread lies.
[PUT NOT THY HAND WITH THE WICKED.] Its meaning is, do not join a wicked person<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Two witnesses are required in Jewish law.</i> in testifying falsely to harm the innocent. A poor person might do this because of his poverty.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. most of the laws from Ex. 22:24 to 23:13 deal with the poor.

Verse 2

THOU SHALT NOT FOLLOW A MULTITUDE TO DO EVIL. If you see many people testifying concerning something that you know nothing of, do not say to yourself all of these people cannot be lying.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hence I will back up their testimony.</i> Saadiah Gaon says that there are two commandments in this verse. One is a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil</i>.</i> the other a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">You shall follow the majority.</i> The Gaon says that<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This verse teaches.</i> we are obligated to follow the majority,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse ends with the words <i>achare rabbim le-hattot</i>. Saadiah, like the Talmud (<i>San</i>. 2a), interprets this to mean you shall follow the majority; that is, legal questions are decided by the majority opinion of the court.</i> for Saadiah thought that the word <i>le-hattot</i> (to pervert) has the same meaning as <i>li-netot</i> (to turn).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Or follow. Hence Saadiah interpreted <i>achare rabbim le-hattot</i> as you shall follow the majority. It should be noted that both <i>li-netot</i> and <i>le-hattot</i> come from the same root, <i>nun, tet, heh</i>.</i> However, this is not the case. <i>Le-hattot</i> is a <i>pi’el</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas <i>li-netot</i> is a <i>kal</i>. There is an obvious error in I.E. <i>Le-hattot</i> is a <i>hifil</i>. The error was probably made by a scribe, or it is a slip of the pen.</i> It is similar to the word <i>matteh</i> (perverteth) in <i>Cursed be he that perverteth the justice due to the stranger, fatherless, and widow</i> (Deut. 27:19). This form<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>hifil</i> form of <i>nun, tet, heh</i>.</i> is also found without the word justice following it.

Our rabbis of blessed memory derived the law that the <i>halakha</i> follows the majority opinion from this verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See note 5.</i> They transmitted the truth to us, for after Scripture states, <i>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil</i>, we learn that we are commanded to follow a multitude that wants to do good.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the law which the sages transmitted is correct. However, their interpretation of <i>achare rabbim le-hattot</i> does not follow the plain meaning of the text. It was merely a device by which to pass on the law.</i>
NEITHER SHALT THOU BEAR WITNESS. This commandment falls upon all of Israel. How much more so is a judge, before whom a dispute comes, obligated to help his neighbor.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">By seeing to it that he gets a fair trial.</i>

Verse 3

NEITHER SHALT THOU FAVOR A POOR MAN. This too is connected [to <i>If thou lend money to any of My people even to the poor</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 22:24. See note 2.</i> as you might think that you are doing good in helping the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">By being partial to him in judgment.</i> Scripture elsewhere states, <i>nor favor the person of the mighty</i> (Lev. 19:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it is prohibited to favor either the rich or the poor.</i>

Verse 4

THINE ENEMY’S OX. <i>Oyivkha</i> (thine enemy’s) is spelled with a <i>chirik</i> beneath the <i>yod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">And is thus irregular. For the <i>tzere</i> beneath the second stem letter usually changes to a <i>segol</i> when a word is combined with a pronominal suffix.

One observes God’s law and one also acts kindly with the poor.

Verse 5

THOU SHALT FORBEAR. <i>Ve-chadalta</i> (thou shalt forbear) is similar to <i>chadal</i> (forbear) (II Chron. 25:16), the meaning of which is, forbear from doing this thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>chadal</i> (forbear) implies forbear from doing this thing.

Saadiah Gaon says that the word <i>tzaddikim</i> (righteous) modifies <i>divre</i> (words of).<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>tzaddikim</i> is an adjective modifying <i>divre</i>.</i> However, this is not possible, for <i>divre</i> is in the construct.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">With <i>tzaddikim</i>. Hence <i>divre tzaddikim</i> must be rendered as words of the righteous, as a noun cannot be in the construct with an adjective.</i>
[RIGHTEOUS.] <i>Righteous</i> refers to righteous in the matter before the judges, not righteous with regard to the observance of the commandments.

Verse 9



Verse 10

AND SIX YEARS. This too<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Like many of the previous laws.</i> is mentioned because of <i>that the poor of thy people may eat</i> (v. 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it too takes its point of departure from Ex. 22:24.</i>

Verse 11

BUT THE SEVENTH YEAR THOU SHALT LET IT REST. This is the year that the Lord’s release is proclaimed. One is then prohibited from exacting a debt from his needy neighbor.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 15:2. Hence this law too takes its point of departure from Ex. 22:24.</i>
AND LIE FALLOW. <i>U-netashta</i> (and lie fallow)<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and thou shalt leave it. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> means it shall not be sown. <i>And we would forego</i> (ve-nittosh)<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-nittosh</i> and <i>ve-netashta</i> come from the same root <i>nun</i>, <i>tet, shin</i>.</i> <i>the seventh year</i> (Neh. 10:32) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">It means we will not sow in the seventh year.</i>

Verse 12

SIX DAYS. Scripture also mentions that <i>the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger</i>, who is in your gate, who is poor, and [who] hires himself out to you, <i>may be refreshed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Hence this law too takes its point of departure from Ex. 22:24.</i>

Verse 13

AND IN ALL THINGS THAT I HAVE SAID UNTO YOU TAKE YE HEED. Scripture now mentions idolatry. <i>And in all things that I have said unto you</i> refers to God’s commandments and ordinances. Observe them, not the ordinances of other gods. Scripture says, <i>and make no mention of the name of other gods</i> ; that is, do not mention their names in any oath or cause their adherents to swear by their names. The precise meaning of <i>neither let it be heard out of thy mouth</i> is: you shall not cause others to swear by their names; that is, do not tell an idolater, “Swear to me by your god.” 

Verse 14

[THREE TIMES.] The meaning of <i>regalim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>regel</i> means a foot. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> is times. You shall serve only Me. You shall serve Me three times a year by coming before Me like a servant who comes before his master to bring him a gift. Scripture therefore afterwards reads, <i>el</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The I.E. texts have <i>et</i>. This is probably a scribal error, as verse 17 reads <i>el</i>.</i><i> pene ha-adon Adonai</i> (v. 17),<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to the face of the Lord God. Hence I.E. notes that the word <i>el pene</i> (to the face of) has the same meaning as <i>li-fene</i> (before the face of, i.e., in front of or before).</i> the meaning of which is, <i>before the Lord</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>adon</i> (master). In other words, Scripture employs the term Lord or Master because we must come before Him as a servant comes before his master.</i> <i>God</i> (v. 17). <i>And none shall appear before Me empty</i> (v. 15) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Servants bring gifts to their masters.</i> Scripture mentions this because pagans go to worship their vanities on specific days.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, according to I.E., the purpose of the pilgrimage festivals is to keep Israel from worshipping idols. Maimonides offers a similar explanation. See <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i>, 3:45,46.</i> Scripture therefore reads, <i>thou shalt keep a feast unto Me</i>, the meaning of which is, only unto Me.
[THOU SHALT KEEP A FEAST.] The word <i>tachog</i> (thou shalt keep a feast) means thou shalt sacrifice. It is similar to the word <i>chag</i> (sacrifice) in <i>tie the sacrifice with ropes</i> (Ps. 118:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i>
TIMES. The word <i>regalim</i> comes from the same root as <i>regel</i> (foot), for most of the people come on foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">When they make their annual pilgrimage to the house of God.</i>

Verse 15

THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD. Scripture starts with the festival of unleavened bread<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">That is it lists the festival of Passover before that of Sukkot and Shavu’ot.</i> because it falls in the first month of the year.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 21:2.</i> Now Scripture states, <i>seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</i>. This is similar to <i>Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days</i> (Deut. 16:13). It is thus an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">To eat unleavened bread for seven days. The latter contradicts the Rabbinic opinion that the obligation to eat matzah is limited to the first night of Passover. See <i>Pesachim</i> 120a. However, I.E. spoke only from the point of view of the plain meaning of the text.</i> However, <i>Six days thou shalt do thy work</i> (v. 12) differs.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">For there is no obligation to work six days.</i> For Scripture immediately states that one has to rest on the seventh day (<i>Ibid</i>.).<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The thrust of Scripture thus is that one must rest on the Sabbath. The meaning of <i>Six days thou shalt do thy work, but the seventh day thou shalt rest</i> is you may do your work during the first six days of the week but you must rest on the Sabbath day.</i> <i>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</i> differs from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>Six days thou shalt do thy work</i>. For <i>seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</i> is an obligation, but, <i>Six days thou shalt do thy work</i> is not an obligation.</i> Furthermore, why doesn’t Scripture read, seven days you shall not eat leavened bread?<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</i> merely means seven days you shall not eat leavened bread, then Scripture should have so stated.</i>
IN THE MONTH ABIB. I have already explained this.
[AND NONE SHALL APPEAR BEFORE ME EMPTY.] Many think that <i>ve-lo yera’u fanai rekam</i> (and none shall appear before Me empty) is like <i>u-fanai lo yera’u</i> (but My face shall not be seen) (Ex. 33:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-lo yera’u fanai rekam</i> means: and My face shall not be seen when [the worshipper is] empty-handed. According to this interpretation the words <i>lo yera’u</i> refer to God’s face (<i>fanai</i>).</i> However, this is incorrect, for those who come to the house of the Lord are there seen.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>ve-lo yera’u fanai rekam</i> means: and none shall appear before My face [or before Me] empty. I.E.’s point is that <i>ve-lo yera’u</i> in <i>ve-lo yera’u fanai</i> refers to the worshipper but <i>lo yera’u</i> in <i>u-fanai lo yera’u</i> refers to God’s face.</i> <i>Venireh et pene Adonai</i> (That he may appear before the Lord) (I Sam. 1:22) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">That it is the worshipper who is said to be seen before God.</i> The phrase <i>et pene Adonai</i> in <i>yera’eh khol zekhurekha et pene Adonai</i> (shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God) (Deut. 16:16) means before the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Not the face of God. <i>Yera’eh</i> is a <i>nifal</i> and refers to <i>khol zekhurekha</i> (all thy males) rather than to <i>et pene Adonai</i>. I.E. comments thus because <i>et pene Adonai</i> might be taken to mean the face of God.</i>

Verse 16

AND THE FEAST OF HARVEST. The harvest of the first of the wheat. Now the barley crop which is what Abib refers to<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>chodesh ha-aviv</i> means the month when the first barley appears.</i> is always there when the festival of unleavened bread arrives. There are seven weeks from the arrival of the first barley to the arrival of the first wheat. Compare, <i>Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee</i> (Deut. 16:9).
AND THE FEAST OF INGATHERING, AT THE END OF THE YEAR. And a new year commences. Sowing begins in the month of Marcheshvan.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah seems to tell us that the year comes to a close towards the end of Tishri (Sukkot falls in the middle of Tishri). However, the new year begins with Tishri. Hence I.E. points out that Scripture here speaks of an agricultural year. That year ends in Tishri with the fall harvest and begins in Marcheshvan when the new crop is sown.</i>

Verse 17

THREE TIMES. These three times, concerning which I said, <i>None shall appear before Me empty</i> (v. 15), was said only with regard to males who are of the age when they are obligated to observe the commandments. Those who are ill and cannot come are exempt.

Verse 18

THE BLOOD OF MY SACRIFICE. The reference is to the sacrifice of the paschal offering, which is eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
THE FAT OF MY FEAST. The reference is to the unblemished lamb<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The paschal lamb. See Ex 12:5. I.E.’s point is that <i>the blood of My sacrifice</i> and <i>the fat of My feast</i> refer to the same animal.</i> which one is obligated to offer. It is similarly written, <i>in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat till the morning</i> (II Chron. 35:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">There is apparently an error in the text. Chronicles reads: <i>in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat until night</i>. It is possibly a scribal error. On the other hand, I.E. may have quoted from memory and erred. If I.E. quoted the verse properly, then he is offering proof from Chronicles that the fat of offering was not allowed to remain overnight (Krinsky). In his short commentary, I.E. explains that the fat of the paschal lamb could be burnt till the morning because of the many sacrifices offered. He quoted II Chron. 35:14 to illustrate the normal procedure.</i>

Verse 19

THE CHOICEST FIRST-FRUITS OF THY LAND. This is what <i>And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto the Lord</i> (Lev. 2:14) refers to. As I will explain in its place, the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 2:14.</i> is directed to the individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than the community. According to Rashi, Lev. 2:14 speaks of the <i>Omer</i> which the community is obligated to offer. Hence I.E.’s comment. See Rashi on Lev. 2:14.</i> Scripture mentions this law after <i>Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread</i> (v. 18), for the first fruits begin then.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">One is permitted to start enjoying one’s first fruits from the second day of Passover. See Lev. 22:9-14.</i>
[THOU SHALT NOT SEETHE A KID IN ITS MOTHER’S MILK.] The fools<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The Karaites. Cf. I.E.’s short commentary.</i> say that the word <i>gedi</i> (a kid) comes from the same root as <i>meged</i> (precious fruit).<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>mem, gimel, dalet</i>. These commentators interpret <i>lo tivashel gedi ba-chalev immo</i> (thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk) as you shall not ripen the fruit in the juices of its tree. See below.</i> However, this is impossible, for the <i>mem</i> of <i>meged</i> is a root letter. The word <i>megadim</i> (precious fruit) in <i>with precious fruit</i> (Cant. 4:13) is definite proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">That the <i>mem</i> of <i>megadim</i> is a root letter. Compare, <i>melekh, melakhim</i>.</i> We do not find such a thing in the Hebrew language.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That the first letter of a root that ordinarily does not drop any letters should fall out and a new form be created. Hence the word <i>gedi</i> cannot mean precious fruit.</i> Furthermore, how are we to explain <i>lo tivashel</i> (thou shalt not seethe)?<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">These commentators explain <i>lo tivashel</i> (thou shalt not seethe) as you shall not ripen. It should be noted that the Hebrew word for ripen and the Hebrew word for cook both come from the root <i>bet, shin, lamed</i>.</i> A person cannot ripen the precious fruit. Indeed, Scripture states, <i>And for the precious things</i> (u-mi-meged) <i>of the fruits of the sun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The sun, not man, ripens the precious fruit.</i> (Deut. 33:14). Additionally, what reason is there to say <i>in…milk</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">If the reference is to its juices.</i> Where do we find such an expression?<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">That is, where do we find milk referring to the juice of a fruit?</i> Additionally, what is the meaning of <i>its mother’s</i>? Where else is the tree called the mother of the precious fruit? The fools came to this conclusion because they found this commandment coupled with <i>The choicest first-fruits of thy land</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">They thus concluded that this verse teaches that the first fruits are to be picked immediately and not allowed to ripen.</i> Elsewhere we find this commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk</i>.</i> coupled with <i>Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself</i> (Deut. 14:21). The latter is its proper place. However, it<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk</i>.</i> was only mentioned together with the first-fruits because the kids increase and grow then.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">At the time wherein the first fruits appear.</i> There is another commentator who says that the meaning of <i>Thou shalt not seethe</i> is, thou shalt not prolong; that is, a kid shall not be with its mother more than seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to a kid that is first-born. See Ex. 22:29.</i> Now if this is the case, why does Scripture mention this law again?<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">After already having mentioned it in Ex. 22:29.</i> Furthermore, their proof is in the phrase <i>bashel katzir</i> (the harvest is ripe) (Joel 4:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Joel 4:13 reads, <i>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe</i> (bashel). This commentator interprets the verse as: Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest has been long on the vine. <i>Lo tevashel gedi bachalev immo</i> similarly means: Do not leave the kid so that it continues to nurse its mother milk.</i> However, the term <i>bashel</i> means to seethe,<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Not to leave, or prolong its stay.</i> for the sun seethes like fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>bashel katzir</i> literally means the harvest has been seethed, i.e., ripened.</i> It is the same case with <i>hivshilu</i> (ripe)<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hivshilu</i> literally means they caused it to cook.</i> in <i>and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes</i> (Gen. 40:10). Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi. This is also the opinion of the Talmud. See <i>Hullin</i> 113b.</i> says that <i>gedi</i> (a kid) means young and tender. He says it applies to young oxen and young lambs. He claims that the phrase <i>gedi izzim</i> (a kid of the goats) (Gen. 38:17) proves this, since there is no reason to connect them.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to connect <i>gedi</i> to <i>izzim</i>. In other words, if <i>gedi</i> means a young goat, then Gen. 38:17 should have read <i>gedi</i>, not <i>gedi izzim</i>, for <i>gedi izzim</i> means a young goat of the goats. See Rashi.</i> However, this is not so. The term <i>gedi</i> applies only to a goat. Thus in Arabic<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">A cognate of Hebrew.</i> the term <i>gedi</i> means a goat. It is never used for any other kind. However, there is a difference between a <i>gedi</i> and a <i>gedi izzim</i>. A <i>gedi</i> is larger than a <i>gedi izzim</i>. A <i>gedi izzim</i> still needs to be with other goats. The same applies to the terms <i>sa’ir</i> (a he-goat) and <i>se’ir izzim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>se’ir izzim</i> cannot survive on its own. It has to be with other goats.</i> Our sages have received the tradition that an Israelite is not permitted to eat meat and milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">That is, our sages have received the tradition that our verse teaches that an Israelite may not eat meat and milk. See <i>Hullin</i> 113b.</i> I will now explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk</i> and the Rabbinic tradition based on it, regarding the prohibition of eating meat and milk.</i> Note that it is the Torah’s custom to speak of that which is most prevalent. For example, the Torah refers to the ostrich as a <i>bat ha-ya’anah</i> (Lev. 11:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the daughter of wailing. In Leviticus chapter 11, the Torah lists the animals which may or may not be eaten. The only species which is referred to as a <i>bat</i> is the ostrich.</i> Now why does the Torah do something here which it does not do in any other place? For in no other place does the Torah refer to an entire species by the term “daughter of” (<i>bat</i>). Note that the flesh of the <i>ya’anah</i> is as dry as wood. It is not customary for people to eat it, as it contains no moisture. The only flesh of this species that is eaten is that of the “daughter” (<i>bat</i>), whose flesh has a little moisture in it because it is a young female.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah refers to an ostrich as a <i>bat</i> because that is the type of ostrich that is usually eaten by those who eat ostriches.</i> However, young ostrich males have no moisture in them. Similarly, people do not eat meat and milk, for it is not pleasant to do so. Meat takes long to cook, but milk boils quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. believed that food that does not cook equally should not be prepared in the same pot.</i> It is not the custom even today in the land of the Ishmaelites for a person to eat a lamb cooked in milk because the lamb is very moist and so is milk. It is thus harmful.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">According to medieval medicine there are four humors: dry, hot, moist, and dry. An imbalance of these humors was thought to cause illness.</i> Hence it is not eaten. On the other hand, the flesh of the kid contains no moisture. When a goat is small it is hot.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">And cooks quickly.</i> Therefore they [inhabitants of Ishmaelite lands] cook the kid with milk. Do not be surprised that the people of the surrounding areas are not in the habit of eating a kid of the goats.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. took pains to point out that the fact that people did not eat kid meat in the area where he wrote his commentary does not negate his earlier point. He had explained that the reason Scripture reads, <i>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk</i>, rather than “thou shalt not seethe meat in milk” was that people do the former and not the latter. People do not refrain from eating goat’s meat because of health reasons. They do so because of local idiosyncrasies.</i> All the physicians admit that there is no comparable meat, and they even permit the sick to eat it. They similarly eat it in Spain, Africa, the Land of Israel, Persia, and Babylonia. It was similarly the custom of the ancients to eat it. We thus read: <i>two good kids of the goats</i> (Gen. 27:9); <i>that we may make ready a kid for thee</i> (Jud. 13:15). We also find that the <i>kohen</i> eats the kid of the goats that is brought as a sin offering (Lev. 6:19; 23:19,20). It is because it is not the custom for a person to eat raw meat that the Torah prohibited a person from cooking a kid in its mother’s milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is explaining why Scripture prohibited a kid cooked with milk but did not prohibit the eating of raw kid meat and milk.</i> Some say that <i>bishul</i> (seething) only applies to meat roasted over a fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>lo tivashel</i> (thou shalt not seethe) means thou shalt not roast.</i> However, is it not written, <i>u-vasel mevushal bamayim</i> (sodden…with water) (Ex. 12:9)? We similarly find that the Book of Chronicles states <i>bi-shelu ba-sirot</i> (sod they in pots) (II Chron. 35:13). There is no need for us to search for the reason it is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">To seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.</i> The reason is hidden from the eyes of the intelligent. It is possible that it is prohibited to seethe a kid in its mother’s milk because to do so is very cruel. The idea behind this law is like the idea behind <i>And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day</i> (Lev. 22:28), and <i>thou shalt not take the dam with the young</i> (Deut. 22:6). It is the practice of most people that do not have a flock to buy milk in the market.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">If the reason for the prohibition of seething a kid in its mother’s milk is cruelty, then the prohibition applies only to its own mother’s milk and to no one else’s. I.E. thus wants to explain why it is prohibited to seethe a kid in any milk that is purchased.</i> In such a case the milk usually consists of a mixture coming from many goats. It is possible for the buyer of a kid not to know where the mother is.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">He would know which animal is its mother only if the kid was born in his house.</i> Now if the one who has bought a kid later buys milk, it is possible that some of this milk contains milk from the mother of the kid which he previously purchased. He will then violate the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">If he cooks the kid in the milk which he has newly purchased.</i> We must be strict when in doubt regarding a Biblical law.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Hence one is not permitted to cook a kid in any milk that was purchased.</i> The Ishmaelites also admit that if one cooks a kid in its mother’s milk the resulting dish tastes better because the mother and the kid are similar in nature. Scripture speaks of what is most usual. The ancients of blessed memory were strict in order to remove all doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">That one never accidentally seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.</i> They thus prohibited meat and milk.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">They prohibited seething a kid in the milk of an animal which is not its mother. They also prohibited having milk with any meat.</i> God who gave them wisdom will fully reward them. I will further explain in each of their respective places why Scripture noted this law a second<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 24:26.</i> and a third time.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 14:21. I.E. never did explain it (Weiser).</i>

Verse 20

BEHOLD, I SEND AN ANGEL BEFORE THEE. God told Moses that he should also<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in addition to relating the laws to Israel.</i> tell Israel that if they accept all the laws<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, things.</i> and ordinances, starting from <i>Ye yourselves have seen</i> (Ex. 20:19),<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Until this point.</i> then God would bring them into the land.
[AN ANGEL.] Many err concerning the angel. Some say that the angel refers to the Book of the Torah, for Scripture says, <i>for My name is in him</i> (v. 21).<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">This can be rendered, <i>for My name is in it</i>. For the word <i>bo</i> (him) can also mean it.</i> Others say that the reference is to the ark of the covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The ark led the Israelites as an angel does. See Num. 10:33.</i> They interpret <i>and hearken unto his voice</i> (v. 21) as: and hearken to what is written in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Ten Commandments which were in the ark.</i> They also say that <i>for he will not pardon your transgression</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>) means: for God will not pardon your transgressions. Now all of this is nonsense, as this theme<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">The theme of an angel sent by God to guide, protect, and punish.</i> is found throughout Scripture. We thus read: <i>He will send His angel before thee</i> (Gen. 24:7); <i>the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil</i> (Gen. 48:16). Moses similarly said, <i>and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt</i> (Num. 20:16). We likewise read, <i>And the angel of His presence saved them</i> (Is. 63:9); <i>And the angel of the Lord went forth</i> (Is. 37:36); <i>and said to the angel that destroyed the people</i> (II Sam. 24:16); <i>My God hath sent His angel</i> (Dan. 6:23); <i>and the appearance of the fourth is like that of an angel</i> (Dan. 3:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> There are many similar instances. We read in the book of Daniel, <i>The prince of Persia…the prince of Greece</i> (Dan 10:20); <i>except Michael your prince</i> (Dan. 10:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that the princes spoken of in Daniel are angels (Krinsky). He makes this point now because he previously noted that the Bible speaks of angels. It is also possible that I.E. discusses Daniel because he identifies the angel in our chapter with Michael. See note 133.</i> Michael is the angel referred to as the great prince, for he is exalted above many others. Scripture also states regarding Michael, <i>one of the first princes, came to help me</i> (Dan. 10:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> The meaning of first is, first in rank. It is like <i>and sat first in the kingdom</i> (Esther 1:14). The angel referred to<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse (Krinsky). Or in Dan. 10:13 (Weiser).</i> is Michael.
TO KEEP THEE BY THE WAY. So that nothing evil happens to you.
WHICH I HAVE PREPARED. For you. Our verse follows the idea <i>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance</i> (Deut. 32:8),<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">According to I. E. the meaning of <i>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance</i> is: When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, he set aside the land of Canaan for the children of Israel. Hence our verse states, which I have prepared [for you].</i> which I will discuss later.

Verse 21

TAKE HEED OF HIM. Every angel follows God’s command. The angel does not add or subtract from what God has commanded him.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Thus his instructions are to be followed explicitly.</i> The same applies to Satan, who tormented Job.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Whatever that angel (Satan) did, he did by God’s command.</i> He was an angel. It was the same case with the angel who went out to hinder Balaam. Now, whoever hearkens to the voice of the angel is hearkening to the voice of God the glorious.
[BE NOT REBELLIOUS AGAINST HIM.] The word <i>tammer</i> (rebellious) is difficult. Its meaning appears to be similar to <i>va-yamru</i> (rebelled)<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>mem, resh, heh</i>.</i> in <i>but they rebelled against Me</i> (Ezek. 20:8). However, in this case our word should have read <i>tamreh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tamreh</i> is the second person imperfect form of the root <i>mem, resh, heh</i>.</i> The Spanish scholars were therefore forced to say that <i>tammer</i> comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mem, resh, resh</i>.</i> It is like <i>vayassev</i> (led about)<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Whose root is <i>samekh, bet, bet</i>. The second person imperfect form of which is <i>tassev</i>.</i> in <i>But the Lord led the people about</i> (Ex. 13:18), for the entire form<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">The various forms in which the root of <i>va-yassev</i> comes.</i> comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Samekh, bet, bet</i>.</i> <i>Venasevah</i> (wound about) in <i>were broader as they wound about</i> (Ezek. 41:7) is a <i>nifal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>samekh, bet, bet</i>. I.E. notes this because a reader might not realize it at first glance. He might think that <i>ve-nasevah</i> comes from the root <i>nun, samekh, bet</i>.</i> It<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ve-nasevah</i>.</i> is like <i>ve-navela</i> (confound)<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>nifal</i>.</i> in <i>and there confound</i> (Gen. 11:7), which comes from the same root as <i>balal</i> (mixed).<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>bet, lamed, lamed</i>.</i> It is also similar to <i>ve-navekah</i> (empty)<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>nifal</i>.</i> in <i>And the spirit of Egypt shall be made empty</i> (Is. 19:3), which comes from the same root as <i>bokek</i><sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>bet, kof kof</i>.</i> (empty) (Is. 24:1). Do not be surprised that we have two roots<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mem, resh, resh</i>, and <i>mem, resh, heh</i>.</i> with one meaning. For we find this to be the case with the words <i>sorer</i> (bear rule)<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>sin, resh, resh</i>.</i> and <i>sarita</i> (striven)<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>sin, resh, heh</i>.</i> in <i>that every man shall bear rule</i> (sorer) <i>in his own house</i> (Esther 1:22) and in <i>for thou hast striven</i> (sarita) <i>with God</i> (Gen. 32:29). The same is true of <i>tammer</i> (rebellious) in <i>be not rebellious against him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> and <i>memer</i> (rebellious) in <i>And rebellious to her that bore him</i> (Prov. 17:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. These two words, whose root is <i>mem, resh, resh</i>, have the same meaning as words that come from the root <i>mem, resh</i>, <i>heh</i>.</i> <i>Memer</i> follows the paradigm of <i>mekhes</i> (tribute) (Num. 31:28), which comes from the same root as <i>takhossu</i> (ye shall make your count) in <i>ye shall make your count for the lamb</i> (Ex. 12:4). It comes from a double root.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>kaf, samekh, samekh</i>.</i>
[FOR MY NAME IS IN HIM.] Note that <i>for My name is in him</i> is connected to <i>Take heed of him, and hearken unto his voice</i> (v. 21).<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than connected to <i>for he will not pardon your transgression</i>, which precedes it.</i> It is like <i>And also unto thy bondwoman thou shalt do likewise</i> (Deut. 15:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Which is also not connected to what comes immediately before it.</i> I have already explained that God’s glorious name<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>YHVH</i>.</i> is a proper name, as it refers only to the Lord. It is also found as an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 3:15; 6:3.</i> For God is all, and all comes from Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 1:26.</i>
[IN HIM.] God is said to be <i>in him</i> in the same sense that the center of a circle is equally distant to all points on the circumference of the circle.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>in him</i> does not mean that God is only in the angel, for God is everywhere. I.E. later points out that even though God is all over, His being is more manifest in certain places.</i> It is only in this sense that Scripture tells us that God’s glory is in the midst of the camp,<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Of Israel.</i> and that the Lord’s glory journeys in the camps.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Of Israel.</i> It is thus written, <i>that Thou Lord art in the midst of this people</i> (Num. 14:14). Scripture likewise reads, <i>And formed the spirit of man within him</i> (Zech. 12:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Man’s spirit rests in the heart, which is the center of the body (Krinsky). However, its effect is felt all over the body. God is, as it were, similarly the center of the world, and He is equally all over.</i> Do not be astonished that Scripture first reads, <i>But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto</i> his <i>voice</i> (Ex. v. 22) and then goes on to say, <i>and do all that</i> I <i>speak</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.).<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture first says, <i>his</i> [the angel’s] voice, and then says, all that <i>I</i> [God] speak.</i> I will give you an example by which you can understand the above. All the scientists who study astronomy have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the moon is a body which receives its light from the sun, for the moon has no light.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Of its own.</i> It is for this reason that the sun grows dark when the moon joins it<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Eclipses it.</i> during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">If the moon had light of and by itself, its light would then be visible.</i> The sun and the moon are both embedded in spheres that are similar to the spheres of the constellations.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, they both circle the earth.</i> The darkness results only from the fact that the moon, which like the sun is circular, passes beneath the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">And blocks its light.</i> Now the side of the moon which faces the sun is totally illuminated. However, the side which is above it is dark. It is not illuminated. Observe that the moon thereby blocks the light of the sun. The moon is also left without light even in the middle of a lunar month<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">When the moon is full.</i> if the shadow of the earth comes between it and the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">If the earth eclipses it. We thus see that the moon has no light of its own.</i> Look! We know that the light of the moon at night illuminates the air. Now if Reuben calls the light of the moon moonlight, he speaks the truth. If Simeon refers to the light of the moon as sunlight, he too speaks the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the angel speaks God’s word. Thus when the angel speaks, one can say either that the angel speaks or that God speaks.</i> 

Verse 22

[AN ADVERSARY.] The wise men of Spain found the word <i>evah</i> (enmity)<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Spelled <i>alef, yod, bet, heh</i>. The <i>yod</i> is not sounded. The root of <i>evah</i> is <i>alef, yod, bet</i>.</i> spelled with a silent <i>yod</i> (Gen. 3:15). However, our verse reads, <i>ve-ayavti</i><sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">From the same root as <i>evah</i>.</i> <i>et oyevekha</i> (I will be an enemy unto thine enemies).<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in our verse the <i>yod</i> is sounded.</i> They also found Scripture reading <i>tzed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Spelled <i>tzadi, yod, dalet</i>. The <i>yod</i> is silent in <i>tzed</i>.</i> <i>chayyah</i> (in hunting any beast) (Lev. 17:13) and <i>tzayyadim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>yod</i> is sounded in <i>tzayyadim</i>. Both <i>tzayyadim</i> and <i>tzed</i> come from the same root.</i> (hunters) (Jer. 16:16). They also found the word <i>din</i> (the cause) in <i>They plead not the cause of the poor</i> (Jer. 5:28)<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. took <i>of the poor</i> from Jer. 22:16. It does not appear in Jer. 5:28.</i> and <i>dayyan</i><sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>yod</i> is silent in the word <i>din</i> but sounded in <i>dayyan</i>. Both <i>din</i> and <i>dayyan</i> come from the same root.</i> (judge) in <i>The Lord therefore be judge</i> (I Sam. 24:16). They therefore said that a verb has no less than three letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>yod</i>, as we have seen, is not sounded in <i>tzed</i> and <i>din</i>. This would seem to indicate that these words come from a two-letter stem and that the <i>yod</i> serves as a vowel letter. However, in view of the fact that the <i>yod</i> is sounded in <i>tzayyad</i> and <i>dayyan</i>, it is clear that these words have a threeletter root, and that the <i>yod</i> in <i>tzed</i> and <i>din</i> is a root letter.</i> Hence <i>evah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Like <i>tzed</i>, and <i>din</i>.</i> comes from a root whose middle letter is silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>alef, yod, bet</i>.</i>

Verse 23

FOR. God commanded Israel to remove all idols immediately upon coming to the Land of Israel. He mentioned six nations and did not bother to mention the smallest among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">The Girgashite. See Gen. 10:16. The Girgashite was one of the seven nations inhabiting Canaan.</i> It is concerning the latter that God said, <i>and I will</i> [<i>immediately</i>] <i>cut him off</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. J.P.S. reads; <i>I will cut them off</i>. In Hebrew the Girgashites are referred to as “him” (“it” in English) in the singular because they were separated from the other Canaanite nations and immediately destroyed (Weiser).</i> As to the others, <i>By little and little I will drive them out</i> (v. 29). It is also possible that <i>and I will cut him off</i> means: and I will cut off each one of them. It is like <i>Its branches run over the wall</i> (Gen. 49:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is that each one of its branches runs over the wall. According to I.E. when Scripture refers to the many by the singular, it may mean each one of the many. See I.E. on Gen. 49:22 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 24

THOU SHALT NOT BOW DOWN TO THEIR GODS. This is what I referred to earlier when I said that the Book of the Covenant<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 24:7 speaks of the Book of the Covenant. According to I.E. the Book of the Covenant consists of Ex. 20:19 through Ex. 23:33. When Moses later wrote the entire Pentateuch he incorporated it into the Torah.</i> opens and closes with a warning against idol worship. For <i>Ye yourselves have seen</i> (Ex. 20:19), which opens the Book of the Covenant, is a warning against idolatry, as is <i>for they will be a snare unto thee</i> (v. 33), which closes the book. However, there is a difference between the two. At the beginning of the book God commanded [Israel] not to make a god of silver alongside the Lord. At the end of the book He commanded Israel to uproot from the land of Canaan all the idols that its inhabitants had made. For whoever worships idols violates, as it were, all the negative commandments of the Torah. Furthermore, all of the positive commandments which he observes are of no avail to him in this world or in the next world.

Verse 25

AND YE SHALL SERVE THE LORD…HE WILL BLESS THY BREAD AND THY WATER. Its meaning is, you shall serve only the Lord who took you out of the house of bondage and brought you to the land of nations which served other gods who were not able to save them from your hands. Serving God is defined as doing all that the Lord has commanded, namely, to love the Lord, to cleave unto Him, to swear by His name, to pray to Him, to sacrifice the daily and the additional offerings unto Him and to honor Him by giving tithes. One who does the above has his reward with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Is assured of his reward.</i> The latter consists of the following four things<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in our verse.</i> which he will receive in this world. One, <i>And He</i> (God) <i>will bless thy bread and thy water</i>. Two, <i>I</i> (God) <i>will take sickness away from the midst of thee</i>. Three, <i>None shall miscarry, nor be barren, in thy land</i> (v. 26). Four, <i>The number of thy days I</i> (God) <i>will fulfill</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.). Now all of these rewards pertain to the body. In addition, God will do the reverse of these blessings to your enemies; namely, <i>I will send</i> <i>My terror before thee</i> (v. 27); <i>And I will send the hornet before thee</i> (v. 28). 
Abraham the author writes: There are some great scholars who are very learned in the two laws<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">The written Torah and the oral Torah.</i> but have not studied the sciences. I therefore cannot begin to explain the abovementioned blessings without first mentioning a bit of the sciences.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. held that a person cannot fully comprehend the Torah if he or she is ignorant of the sciences.</i> Man’s body comes from the lowest world. However, man’s soul (<i>neshamah</i>), which is tied to the body,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">During a person’s lifetime.</i> comes from on high. There are two powers that are intermediate between the body and the soul. These two powers are referred to in the main in Hebrew as <i>ru’ach</i> (spirit) and <i>nefesh</i> (life force, appetite, desire), for the soul (<i>neshamah</i>) is the rational part of man and its place is in the brain of man. From it comes the power of all emotions and the desire to move.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the desire to move the body (Krinsky).</i> The <i>ru’ach</i> (spirit) is situated in the heart. Life depends on the <i>ru’ach</i>. The <i>ru’ach</i> desires to dominate; that is, it seeks to overcome all opposition. It is the source of anger. Solomon similarly said, <i>Be not hasty in thy spirit</i> (ruchakha) <i>to be angry</i> (Eccles. 7:9), and <i>A fool spendeth all his spirit</i> (rucho) (Prov. 29:11). The seat of the <i>nefesh</i> (life force, appetite, desire) is in the liver. It is the <i>nefesh</i> that desires to eat. It is thus written, <i>because thy soul</i> (nafshekha) <i>desires</i> (Deut. 12:20). The <i>nefesh</i> is the source of sexual desire. Now some people are created in such a way that these three souls are strong. In others they are weak. In other instances one soul is strong, another weak, or neither weak nor strong. Now, people fall into twenty-seven categories.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">There are 27 possible combinations of the three souls, or powers, in their three possible states: strong, weak, and intermediary. See Krinsky and Filwarg.</i> God gave the Torah to strengthen, to intensify, and to increase the power of man’s supernal soul. When this happens the body does not rule over it. However, if the Torah is not observed, then the body overpowers the <i>neshamah</i>. I will explain<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">How the soul can or cannot overcome the body’s desires.</i> with the following parable. We know from the teachings of the sciences that any person whose constitution is overcome by red bile will be angry, for this is the nature of fire<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">It is the nature of fire to consume. So too with anger, which takes over the body.</i> and red bile is like fire. Now when the <i>neshamah</i> is unintelligent it pursues the wants of the body because it cannot overcome its desires. Additionally, let us consider a person who is not by nature hot. If another person comes along and curses him to the point where he becomes angry, he begets heat in his body which was not there before he became angry. God the exalted, in his kindness, chose Israel and taught them His Torah. If Israel observes the Torah they become wise. Their wisdom guides them in a straight path to all things that will not harm them. The general rule is: the body must be subservient to the dictates of the soul (<i>neshamah</i>) rather than the soul being subservient to the dictates of the body. When the soul (<i>neshamah</i>) is strong, then the heavenly power known as nature, which preserves the body, grows in might. Now our verse tells us that God’s blessing shall be upon all our food and drink. For there is a curse that adversely effects the power of nature, as in <i>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied</i> (Micah 6:14). Observe that all illnesses come from the food that enters the body. Now a person who observes the Torah will not fear them. This is the meaning of <i>and He will bless thy bread</i>. There are other diseases that come from outside the body due to a change in the air caused by a shift in the arrangement of the planets. It is concerning this that our verse states, <i>and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee</i>. Look, a person who observes the Torah has no need for a physician along with God the Revered. Scripture thus writes, <i>yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians</i> (II Chron. 16:12). I have thus spoken on the science of medicine. I will now speak on the science dealing with the heavenly bodies. Note that what befalls human beings depends on the alignment of the planets and what their arrangement indicates at the time of a person’s birth. The aforementioned is extremely difficult to understand. If a woman is born under an arrangement that decrees she will not be able to carry her children to term, then it will be the nature of her womb to abort the children in it. The same is true if the woman is born under an arrangement that decrees that she be barren and not have children. Now if a person who is born under an arrangement of the planets that determines that he will have a physical makeup that is unable to beget children cleaves to God, then if he truly cleaves to God, the revered God will strengthen the power of this man’s kidneys and see to it that his sperm functions properly so that he will be able to have children. God therefore told Abraham, <i>I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be thou whole-hearted</i> (Gen. 17:1). This is what the rabbis meant by “Cease thy planet gazing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sabbath</i> 156a (Soncino): “How do we know that Israel is immune from planetary influence? Because it is said, <i>And He brought him</i> (Abraham) <i>forth from abroad</i> (Gen. 15:5). Abraham pleaded before the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Sovereign of the Universe! <i>one born in mine house is mine heir’</i> (Gen. 15:3). ‘Not so’, He replied, ‘<i>but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels’</i> (Gen. 15:4). ‘Sovereign of the Universe!’ cried he, ‘I have looked at my constellation and find that I am not fated to beget child.’ Go forth from [i.e., cease] thy planet (gazing), for Israel is free from planetary influence.”</i> God told Abraham, “If you make a treaty to serve Me, I will greatly multiply you, as I will overcome what nature has decreed for you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra’s explanation of the Rabbinic reconstruction of Gen. 25.</i> This is not a victory over the arrangements of the stars,<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. seems to indicate that God does not change the laws of nature. Maimonides had a similar notion. According to Maimonides miracles were built into nature.</i> for they were not created to do good or ill to the lowest world. On the contrary, they always go and do the service of God, as that is what they need to do. The inhabitants of the lowest world receive a thing and its opposite<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">That is, good or bad.</i> from them in accordance with their desire. Thus if we observe the Torah we will not receive evil from the heavenly bodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">This is how God set up the laws of astrology.</i> I will yet speak on this in the Torah portion <i>Ki Tissa</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 30:11; 34:35.</i> The third blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote"><i>None shall miscarry, nor be barren</i> (v. 26).</i> is a blessing to the effect that all of Israel have children and that none of their children die in the lifetime of their parents. 

Verse 26

[BARREN.] The reference is both to one’s wife and to his cattle.
[THE NUMBER OF THY DAYS I WILL FULFILL.] This, the fourth blessing, is a blessing for long life. We know that there is a fixed and established time to every person’s life in accordance with the heat and moisture which are the natural components of the human body. One’s life is not fixed in accordance with the foreign fire<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly a reference to fever.</i> and foreign moisture which are unnatural components of the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, illness can cut short a person’s normal life span.</i> The person who cleaves to God strengthens his body’s heat and moisture through the power of his soul. Such a person will live longer than his allotted life span. We thus read, <i>The fear of the Lord prolongeth days</i> (Prov. 10:27). It is also stated, <i>In the midst of his days he shall leave them</i> (Jer. 17:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Which indicates that doing evil will lead to the shortening of one’s life.</i> We further read, <i>but the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die</i> (I Sam. 26:10). Now a person who dies in war or in a plague does not die on the day set aside for his death in accordance with the nature of the heat and moisture in his body. He dies because of outside events. Now if a person cleaves to God, the Lord will save him from all of these things. We find that the Torah states, <i>lest he die in battle</i> (Deut. 20:5). We also read, <i>why shouldest thou die before thy time</i> (Eccles. 7:17). This does not contradict the science of astrology. For a star’s decree is dependent upon many things, as I will explain in commenting on <i>so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people</i> (Ex. 33:16). Scripture therefore states, <i>behold, I will add unto thy days</i> (Is. 38:5). Why should I continue to go on and on?<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">When I have adequately made my point already.</i>

Verse 27

I WILL SEND MY TERROR. The reference is to a fear in the soul. The body immediately weakens.<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">When fear seizes the soul.</i> This is what <i>and I will make all thine enemies’ necks towards thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. J.P.S. reads, <i>and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee</i>.</i> refers to. Its meaning is: your enemies will turn their necks to you; that is, they will flee from you when you look at them.

Verse 28

AND I WILL SEND THE HORNET. The reference is to a plague in the body which saps its strength. The word <i>tzirah</i> (hornet) comes from the same root as <i>tzara’at</i> (leprosy).<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>And I will send the hornet</i> should be rendered, and I will send the plague.</i> Scripture mentions three of the seven Canaanite nations. However, the same applies to all of the other Canaanite nations. It is also possible that this plague ravaged these three nations more than it did the others.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture mentions only these three.</i>

Verse 29

I WILL NOT. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that this<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to verse 30.</i> will serve as a sign. When Israel will see that they have become fruitful and multiplied, then the seven nations will be uprooted.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah’s paraphrase of verse 30.</i> However, there is no need for this interpretation, for Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> mentions the reason that God will not drive out the Canaanites in one year, namely, <i>lest the land become desolate</i>. The borders of the Land of Israel will be too large for those who left Egypt to be able to settle all of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of verse 30. If God expelled its inhabitants in one year the land would become desolate.</i> <i>Pen</i> (lest) in <i>lest the land</i> is like <i>pen</i> (lest) in <i>lest the fulness of the seed….be forfeited</i> (Deut. 22:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the term <i>pen</i> means lest.</i>

Verse 30

BY LITTLE AND LITTLE. Until you increase and are able to inhabit the entire land. Scripture now goes on to describe the length and breadth of the land.

Verse 31

AND I WILL SET THY BORDER. This is what <i>May he have dominion also from sea to sea, And from the River unto the ends of the earth</i> (Ps. 72:8) refers to. <i>The River</i><sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse and in Psalms. See I.E. on Ps. 72:8.</i> refers to the Euphrates.

Verse 32

THOU SHALT MAKE NO COVENANT WITH THEM. Do not make a covenant with them in any case.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Regardless of the size of your borders.</i>
[NOR WITH THEIR GODS.] Its meaning is, you shall destroy their gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thou shalt make no covenant with them</i> means you shall destroy their gods.</i>

Verse 33

THEY SHALL NOT DWELL IN THY LAND. When you increase, you shall destroy and annihilate all the seven nations. The Book of the Covenant ends here.

Chapter 24



Verse 1

AND UNTO MOSES HE SAID. All that God mentioned from above<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From Ex. 20:19.</i> until now<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 23:33.</i> consisted of the conditions that Moses was to place before Israel. God then told Moses, after you make the covenant with Israel you, Aaron, Aaron’s sons, and seventy of the elders of Israel, namely, the holy first-born, shall come up unto Me.

Verse 2

AND MOSES ALONE SHALL COME NEAR. Do not be amazed that God first said, <i>Come up</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aleh</i> (come up) is in the second person.</i> <i>unto the Lord</i> (v. 1) and then, <i>And Moses alone shall come near unto the Lord</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is in the third person.</i> rather than, and <i><span class="underline">you</span></i> will come near unto the Lord,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, why does Scripture switch from the second to the third person?</i> for this is Hebrew style.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Not to be grammatically consistent.</i> We thus read, <i>Then the Lord caused to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven</i> (Gen. 19:24), the meaning of which is, from Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>From the Lord</i> is another way of saying from Him, as Scripture is referring to the Lord in the third person. I.E.’s point is that Gen. 19:24 is grammatically consistent, for the entire verse is in the third person.</i> However, Samuel said, <i>And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel</i> (I Sam. 12:11). Samuel did not say, and me.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To be consistent, Samuel should have employed a pronoun, for Samuel is the speaker. Thus I Sam. 12:11 is not grammatically consistent. We thus see that not all verses in Scripture are grammatically consistent.</i> There are many such instances.

Verse 3

AND MOSES CAME. Scripture does not mention that Moses came down from the mountain<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20:18 tells us that Moses went up to Mount Sinai. Scripture never tells us that he came down. However, now God tells Moses to go up to Mount Sinai. Thus Moses, at some point after Ex. 23:33, must have come down from the mountain.</i> because there was no need to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For if we find God telling Moses to come up, it is obvious that Moses had previously come down from the mountain. According to I.E., Moses came down from the mountain after he received the Book of the Covenant.</i> The meaning of <i>And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord</i> is, and Moses came in the midst of the camp of Israel and told the people all the positive and negative commandments that are codified between <i>ye your-selves have seen</i> (Ex. 20:19) and <i>for they will be a snare unto thee</i> (Ex. 23:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That is, all the commandments contained in the Book of the Covenant.</i>
AND ALL THE ORDINANCES. Which he placed before them. They are mentioned in this portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah portion <i>Mishpatim</i>.</i>
AND ALL THE PEOPLE ANSWERED. As if they were one person.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-ya’an</i> (answered) is in the singular. It literally means, and he answered. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 4

AND MOSES WROTE. After Moses related all the words of God, the commandments, and the ordinances, he wrote them down. This is what the Book of the Covenant consists of.
AND BUILDED AN ALTAR UNDER THE MOUNT. At the place where Israel stood at the time that the Torah was given. The word <i>va-yiven</i> (and builded) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse is to be read as if written: and he builded twelve pillars.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse is to be read as follows: and builded an altar under the mount, and builded twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</i>

Verse 5

AND HE SENT THE YOUNG MEN OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The reference is to the young men who were the sons of the chosen<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Our texts have <i>ha-bachurim</i> (the chosen). <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 has <i>ha-bekhorim</i> (the first-born). See I.E. on verse 1.</i> elders who were to go up on the mountain with Moses.
WHO OFFERED BURNT-OFFERINGS. This is what <i>and shalt sacrifice thereon</i> (Ex. 20:21) refers to. 
Scripture mentions that oxen were offered as peaceofferings because many people partook of the peaceofferings.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Peace offerings were eaten by the celebrants. Since many celebrants (see previous note) partook of the offerings, oxen, which provide a substantial amount of meat, were sacrificed. Sheep and goats may also be brought as peaceofferings. However, they do not provide the same amount of meat as oxen. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i>

Verse 6

AND MOSES TOOK HALF OF THE BLOOD. Of the burnt and peaceofferings.
[BASINS.] The word <i>agganot</i> (basins) refers to round vessels. Compare, <i>aggan ha-sahar</i> (round goblets) (Cant. 7:3). It is <i>ajan</i> in Arabic.
AND HALF OF THE BLOOD. Of the burnt and peaceofferings <i>he dashed against the altar</i> for God. Observe, the word <i>agganot</i> is to be read as if written twice. Moses placed half of the blood in basins, and he also placed the other half of the blood in basins.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. our verse should be read as if written: and Moses took half the blood and put it in basins; and the other half he put in other basins and dashed the blood against the altar.</i>

Verse 7

AND HE TOOK. When Moses read the Book of the Covenant to the elders and they accepted it upon themselves, he then took the remaining half of blood<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The half that had not been dashed on the altar.</i> and sprinkled it upon the people, that is, the elders, for they stood for all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It would have been impossible for Moses to sprinkle the blood upon all of the people. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> We similarly find the same regarding the bullock offered for an error made by the congregation. We read there, <i>And the elders of the congregation</i>, who were representing all of Israel, <i>shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock</i> (Lev. 4:15).
[AND SPRINKLED IT UPON THE PEOPLE.] This sprinkling<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Moses sprinkled the blood upon their garments (Krinsky).</i> is like <i>and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments</i> (Lev. 8:30).
[BEHOLD THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT.] Moses called it the blood of the covenant.

Verse 8



Verse 9

THEN WENT UP MOSES. Scripture does not mention the mountain because there was no need to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from the context that Moses and those who accompanied him went up on Mount Sinai.</i>

Verse 10

AND THEY SAW THE GOD OF ISRAEL. In a prophetic vision. It is similar to <i>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne</i> (I Kings 22:19; II Chron. 18:18).
[A PAVED WORK OF SAPPHIRE STONE.] Saadiah Gaon says that the <i>sappir</i> (sapphire) is white.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">That is, sapphire stones have a white color.</i> He offers the phrase <i>livnat ha-sappir</i> as proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah Gaon the word <i>livnat</i> (paved of) means whiteness of. Compare, <i>lavan</i> (white). Thus according to the Gaon the meaning of <i>livnat ha-sappir</i> is the whiteness of sapphire.</i> However, this is not the case. The <i>sappir</i> comes in no color but red.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The usual color of sapphires is blue. However, white and yellow sapphires are also quite common. They never come naturally in red. I.E. either did not identify the <i>sappir</i> stone with sapphires, or he did not know what a sapphire was.</i> The fact that it is the style of Scripture to repeat itself in different words proves this. Now it is written, <i>Her princes were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk</i> (Lam. 4:7). We thus see that Scripture repeats itself in different words. The verse continues, <i>They were more ruddy in body than rubies, Their polishing was as of sapphire</i> (sappir) (<i>Ibid</i>.). The term <i>sappir</i> thus has the same connotation as <i>rubies</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">They both allude to the color red.</i> Furthermore, if <i>livnat ha-sappir</i> means like the whiteness of sapphire what reason is there for Scripture to say, <i>like a work</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads, <i>ki-ma’aseh livnat ha-sappir</i>, which according to Saadiah Gaon means like a work of the whiteness of stone.</i> It should have read, like the appearance of.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The whiteness of sapphire. In other words, Scripture should have read, <i>kimareh livnat ha-sappir</i> rather than <i>ki-ma’aseh livnat ha-sappir</i>.</i> Actually, the word <i>livnat</i> is etymologically related to the word <i>levanah</i> (brick). It is like the word <i>cheshkat</i> (darkness of)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Both words are in the construct and are similarly vocalized.</i> in <i>Darkness of waters</i> (Ps. 18:12), which is etymologically related to the word <i>chashekhah</i> (darkness) (Gen. 15:12). Now the <i>paved work of sapphire stone</i> (livnat ha-sappir) was similar to the vision of the sapphire stone which had the form of a throne<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezek. 10:1: <i>Then I looked, and, behold, upon the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim, there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne</i>.</i> seen by Ezekiel in his prophetic vision (Ezek. 1:26; 10:1).
AND THE LIKE OF THE VERY HEAVEN FOR CLEARNESS. Its meaning is, beneath the paved work of sapphire stone there was the likeness of the very heaven. The latter refers to the ice-like firmament that was stretched over the heads of the beasts Ezekiel saw in his vision (Ezek. 1:22). Now our verse reads, <i>and they saw the God of Israel</i>. However, in Ezekiel Scripture reads, <i>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel</i> (Ezek. 10:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that in Ezekiel, God is described as sitting on a throne which was upon a platform held up by four beasts. However, here the throne and the creatures are omitted.</i> Scripture was being brief.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Here. In other words, we must transpose elements of Ezekiel’s vision to complete the account of the vision described in our verse.</i> The creature was under the firmament, and the firmament was under the throne of glory. All of this was under God the revered.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses and the elders saw God sitting upon a throne. God’s throne was upon an icy firmament held up by four creatures.</i>

Verse 11

AND UPON THE NOBLES. The word <i>atzile</i> (nobles of) is similar to the word <i>u-me’atzilehah</i> (from its nobles).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. See I.E. on Is. 41:9.</i> The term elders<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1 tells us that the elders accompanied Moses. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> is not used because the term nobles include Nadab and Abihu.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Who also accompanied Moses. Nadab and Abihu were nobles, not elders. See Rashi and Ramban.</i>
[HE LAID NOT HIS HAND.] Its meaning is: that they saw God and did not die, as I will explain in my comments on the verse <i>for man shall not see Me and live</i> (Ex. 33:20).
[AND DID EAT AND DRINK.] They came down from the mountain happy.
AND DID EAT. The peaceofferings which their young people sacrificed.
AND DRINK. In happiness. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi says that the meaning of <i>and did eat</i> is, they had to eat even though they enjoyed the splendor of God’s presence. Scripture mentions this because Moses lived for forty days and forty nights without eating and drinking, as is noted in the next section.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18. Actually verse 18 only tells us that Moses was on Mount Sinai for 40 days. However, Deut. 9:9 tells us that Moses did not eat or drink during those forty days.</i>

Verse 12

AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: COME UP TO ME INTO THE MOUNT. And be there until I give you [the tables of stone, and the law, etc.].<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, we should interpret our verse as if the term “until” was in the text.</i> A Spanish sage<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. does not identify him, nor can we.</i> said that the first tablets which were the work of God,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 32:15 tells us that the tablets were <i>the work of</i> (ma’aseh) <i>God</i>.</i> which means were finished by God, were created the same size as the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Which was their final form. According to this sage, <i>work of God</i> means put into their final form by God. For the size of the ark, see Ex. 25:10.</i> The second tablets also were The work of God, who is the One who created everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">That is, He created both sets of tablets.</i> However, Moses finished the second tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 34:1. Hence the second tablets are not referred to as God’s work.</i> A finished product is called a work. We thus read, <i>va-yemaher la’asot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>la’assot</i> comes from the same root as the word <i>ma’aseh</i> (work).</i><i>oto</i> (and he hastened to dress it) (Gen. 18:7). The sage said this because Scripture reads, <i>tables of stone</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse and in Ex. 31:18.</i> and does not employ the term <i>stones</i> as it does in reference to the second tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 34:4. Scripture refers to the second tablets as <i>luchot avanim</i>, which literally means tables of stones. It refers to the first tablets as <i>luchot even</i> (tables of stone). The Spanish sage assumed that the phrase <i>luchot even</i> refers to a perfectly created stone, whereas <i>luchot avanim</i> refers to stones which require additional work (Filwarg).</i> Now I pointed out to the above sage that Scripture states,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the first tablets.</i> <i>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone</i> (avanim)<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, stones.</i> (Deut. 9:9). Furthermore, Scripture there<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 9:9,10,12.</i> employs the phrase <i>luchot avanim</i> (tables of stone) three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">All of which are in reference to the first tablets.</i> The meaning of <i>luchot even</i> (tables of stone) therefore<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in view of the fact that Scripture refers to both tablets as <i>luchot avanim</i>, and the distinction that the sage made between them is untenable.</i> is tables made of stone and not of wood.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">It other words, it does not mean perfectly created stones.</i> The Gaon says that <i>which I have written</i> is connected to tablets of stone and not to <i>the law and the commandment</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Which immediately precedes <i>which I have written</i>.</i> for God only wrote the Ten Statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Which He inscribed on the tablets of stone.</i> He explains that the meaning of <i>the law</i> is the written law and that of <i>the commandment</i> is the oral law, as all the commandments were given to Moses on Sinai during the days that Moses was on the mountain. It is similarly written, <i>But as for thee, stand thou here by Me</i> (Deut. 5:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them</i>.</i> However, I believe that <i>the law</i> refers to the first and fifth statements of the Decalogue,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The only two positive commandments in the Decalogue.</i> and <i>and the commandment</i> refers to the other eight statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Which are negative commandments. Hence Scripture refers to them by two different terms. Thus the entire verse deals with the Decalogue. Furthermore, we can now connect <i>which I have written</i> to that which immediately precedes it.</i>

Verse 13

AND MOSES ROSE UP. We may logically conclude that Joshua left the camp of Israel with Moses and stayed beneath the mountain until Moses came down. Observe, Joshua knew nothing about the making of the golden calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he could not have been in the camp.</i> There is no reason to ask, what did Joshua eat?<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Since he was outside of the camp.</i> Joshua gathered the manna which was around the camp and ate it daily.

Verse 14

AND UNTO THE ELDERS. The known elders, namely, the elders who saw God the revered.
AND, BEHOLD AARON. Aaron<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron, like the 70 elders, was a first-born. See I.E.’s comment on verse 1.</i> was also a first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This contradicts the Rabbinic opinion that Miriam was the eldest (<i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:13). See Krinsky and Filwarg.</i> It is possible that Hur was a first-born too and he was one of the seventy. Both of them were to judge in place of Moses until Moses came back. I have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 18:1.</i> that Jethro only came in the second year.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, this occurred before Moses appointed judges over Israel. If judges had been appointed over Israel, Moses would not have found it necessary to appoint Aaron and Hur as judges in his place.</i>

Verse 15

AND MOSES WENT UP…AND THE CLOUD COVERED. The cloud had already covered the mountain on the sixth day of the month.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The cloud did not now cover the mountain. It covered the mountain on the sixth day of the third month, the day that God revealed the Decalogue. Moses ascended the mountain seven days later. <i>Va-yekhas</i> (covered) is to be taken as a pluperfect, meaning: had already covered.</i>

Verse 16

AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD ABODE. This means that the glory of God had already abode, for Scripture clearly states, <i>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai</i>. (Ex. 19:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that God’s glory was previously on the mountain. According to I.E., <i>va-yishkon</i> (abode) is a pluperfect.</i> Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was</i> (Ex. 20:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Also this verse shows that God’s glory was previously on the mountain.</i>
AND THE CLOUD COVERED IT.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and the cloud covered him. There is no neutral form in Hebrew. Thus “him” can refer either to the mountain or to Moses. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The cloud covered Moses and no one was able to see him.
AND THE SEVENTH DAY HE CALLED UNTO MOSES. There is no reason for the Gaon’s question, “Why didn’t Moses go up to the top of the mountain when he went up at first?”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13 tells us that Moses went up the mountain. Our verse tells us that God called unto Moses to come up, i.e., to come up to the top (see I.E. on verse 18). The question thus arises, why didn’t Moses immediately go up to the top of the mountain?</i> Moses was not able to go up<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">To the top of the mountain.</i> without permission.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Without a specific call to go up to the top of the mountain.</i>

Verse 17

AND THE APPEARANCE. Now the mountain was entirely covered by a cloud. God’s glory was on top of the mountain. God the revered was seen there in the form of burning fire.

Verse 18

AND MOSES ENTERED…AND WENT UP INTO THE MOUNT. Its meaning is, and Moses went up to the top of the mount where God’s glory was.
AND MOSES WAS IN THE MOUNT. He did not come down. Scripture writes concerning these forty days, <i>I did neither eat bread nor drink water</i> (Deut. 9:9). This is a great wonder. There never was such a miracle before.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

God who gave a perfect Torah to his children; The Lord who brings to light all hidden things; Will explain to us the words of wisdom inscribed In the Torah portion <i>That They Take For Me An Offering</i>.
AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES. When Moses went up to the top of the mountain<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 24:18.</i> God spoke to him regarding the tabernacle. God told Moses that Israel should construct a sanctuary dedicated to God the revered. The Lord would dwell in this tabernacle and speak therein with Moses. Moses would no longer come up on the mountain.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">To communicate with God.</i> 

Verse 2

[THAT THEY TAKE FOR ME.] The words <i>ve-yikchu li</i> (that they take for Me)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, that they take to me. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> is similar to the form <i>surah elai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, turn to me.</i> (turn in to me) (Jud. 4:18). <i>Surah elai</i> means turn from your place and come to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Turn to me is short for turn from your place and come to me.</i> <i>Ve-yikchu li</i> has a similar connotation. It means let him<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical phrase is in the plural. However, I.E.’s paraphrase is in the singular.</i> take from what he owns and give it to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>that they take for me</i> is short for: that they take from what they own and give to me.</i> The same is true of <i>Fetch me</i> (kechi li), <i>I pray thee, a little water</i> (I Kings 17:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. its meaning is: take, I pray thee, some of your water and give it to me (Weiser).</i>

Verse 3

AND THIS IS THE OFFERING. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that we do not find silver mentioned in connection with the tabernacle except for the silver of those who were counted.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Every Israelite, from the age of 20 and up was obligated to give half a shekel of silver when counted. See Ex. 30:11-14. This was used for sockets, hooks, overlays, and bands for the top of the posts. See Ex. 38:25-28.</i> This being the case, how could Scripture state that the silver was an offering?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In view of the fact that the silver used in the tabernacle was not donated but was collected from people who were obligated to give it.</i> The Gaon answers that other silver was donated for use in the construction of a silver table,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the silver collected for sockets, hooks, overlays, and bands for the top of the posts, silver was donated for use in the construction of a table.</i> since it is highly unlikely that there was no table for preparing things,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the incense or the wicks for the menorah and the like. Scripture nowhere mentions this table. Hence the Gaon’s comment.</i> for cutting, for washing, or for the trumpets and basins.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, upon which to place the trumpets and basins.</i> However, I believe that there is no need for the Gaon’s interpretation. Scripture did not bother to exclude one of the sixteen materials,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture enumerates 16 materials donated to the tabernacle (verses 3-7). However, only 15 were donated. One material (silver) was collected.</i> as fifteen were donated.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it is the style of Scripture to speak of the majority.</i> It is the same with <i>These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddanaram</i> (Gen. 35:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The list of Jacob’s sons, which precedes this verse, includes Benjamin. See Gen. 35:24.</i> However, Benjamin was born in the land of Canaan. He was not born elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Padan-aram. Benjamin is included among those born in Padan-aram because Scripture speaks of the majority of Jacob’s sons. See I.E. on Gen. 35:26.</i> Furthermore, Scripture states, <i>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons</i> (Deut. 10:22). However, the sons of Joseph did not go down to Egypt, for they were born in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Thus fewer than 70 souls went down to Egypt. However, here too Scripture speaks of the majority. See I.E. on Gen. 46:23.</i> Scripture begins with a precious gift, namely, gold. It concludes with a precious gift, onyx stones, and stones to be set,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> which only the princes possessed. However, this was not the case with gold, as most of the people had gold. Now, no iron was used in the construction of the tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">It is not mentioned among any of the donated metals. We may thus infer that it was not used in constructing the tabernacle.</i> Scripture tells us regarding the first temple, <i>and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building</i> (I Kings 6:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The same applies to the tabernacle.</i>

Verse 4

AND BLUE. Yefet<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A Karaite scholar.</i> says that <i>tekhelet</i> (blue) is a blacklike color. Black is the final<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>takhlit</i>. Hence the word <i>tekhelet</i>.</i> color, as all colors turn black,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">All colors eventually turn black.</i> and no human hands can change black.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Black dyes do not turn into any other color.</i> However, we will rely on the sages of the Talmud who said that <i>tekhelet</i> is green wool.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Wool dyed green. See <i>Yebamot</i> 4b.</i>
AND PURPLE. <i>Argaman</i> (purple) is a red-like color. It is referred to as <i>argevan</i> in the Book of Chronicles (II Chron. 2:6) and as <i>arju’an</i> in Arabic. This color is only found in wool or silk.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>argaman</i> refers to silk or wool dyed red.</i>
AND SCARLET. However, Scripture elsewhere reads, <i>sheni ha-tola’at</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>ve-tola’at shani</i> (and scarlet).</i> (and the scarlet) (Lev. 14:6). We find the same with <i>mi-tzur ha-challamish</i> (out of the rock of flint) (Deut. 8:15) and <i>chelmish tzur</i> (out of the flinty rock) (Deut. 32:13). Saadiah Gaon rendered <i>tola’at shani</i> as <i>krimez</i> (red).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Or <i>kermez. Kermez</i> is Arabic for deep red. The English word crimson is derived from it.</i> Although <i>tola’at shani</i> is also red, it is not the same color that <i>argaman</i> is.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture lists them separately.</i> Many people identify <i>tola’at shani</i> with silk<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Which is produced by a worm.</i> because of the word <i>tola’at</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Which means a worm.</i>
AND FINE LINEN. <i>Shesh</i> refers to linen, which is a type of flax that is found only in Egypt. It comes only in white and is not dyed. We thus read, <i>Of fine linen</i> (shesh) <i>and richly woven work</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel reads, <i>with richly woven work</i>.

Verse 5

AND RAMS’ SKINS. Skins from large rams. Such skins are prepared in the land of Al Gudmas<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Located in Libya (Weiser).</i> and are referred to as <i>gudmasi</i>.
AND SEALSKINS. <i>Techashim</i> (seals) refers to a type of animal that was known then,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In Biblical times. However, we can no longer identify it.</i> as it is written, <i>va-ena’alekh tachash</i> (and shod thee with sealskin) (Ezek. 27:7). It is thus clear that it was already known.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the identity of the <i>tachash</i> was known in Ezekiel’s days; otherwise Ezekiel would not have referred to it. I.E. takes issue with the Rabbinic interpretation that the <i>tachash</i> existed only during the time that the tabernacle was constructed. If this was the case, why would Ezekiel refer to it? See Talmud <i>Sabbath</i> 28a. Also see Rashi.</i>
AND ACACIA-WOOD. Some of our ancient sages said<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanchuma</i> 1:9 and <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 94:4. Also see Rashi.</i> that the patriarch Jacob planted acacia trees in Egypt, and Israel, upon the command of Moses, brought them out. <i>And every man, with whom was found</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See note 43.</i> <i>acacia-wood…brought it</i> (Ex. 35:24) is proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">That Israel had acacia wood in their possession. They could have had this wood in their possession only if they had brought it out of Egypt.</i> They possessed acacia as they possessed the blue and the purple.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Which they also brought out of Egypt. See verse 4.</i> However, one wonders, why does Scripture say, <i>with whom was found</i>, which means it was used for personal needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis the meaning of <i>with whom was found</i> is, whoever brought out wood for the purpose of erecting the tabernacle. However, if this was its meaning, then Scripture should have read, whoever brought out (acacia wood) (Krinsky). Hence we must interpret <i>with whom was found</i> according to its plain meaning, i.e., whoever happened to have had acacia wood for his personal needs.</i> Now, if we so interpret it,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">If we interpret the verse <i>with whom was found</i> as meaning that the acacia wood was used by each individual who brought it out of Egypt for that person’s own use.</i> then we must ask, why did the Israelites take acacia wood out of Egypt? What need did they have for acacia wood?<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumes that the Israelites had no need for acacia wood. This being the case, why did the Israelites take it out of Egypt with them?</i> Furthermore, it is clear that the Egyptians thought that the Israelites were going to offer sacrifices and then return to Egypt. That is why the Egyptians lent the Israelites [gold and silver jewels plus raiment].<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 12:35.</i> How could the Israelites take out many boards, each one of which was ten cubits?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the boards would show that the Israelites had no intention of returning to Egypt.</i> The boards were also accompanied by bars.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This intensifies the problem. How could they take out boards and bars from Egypt?</i> In Egypt they passed by the seat of the king. What was their answer to those who asked them why they were carrying acacia wood when they were going on a three-day journey to offer sacrifices? Now we do not know whether our ancestors had a tradition that the Israelites took the acacia wood out of Egypt. If they did, then we will accept their tradition. However, if their statement is based on reasoning, then we must seek another explanation. We suggest that there was a forest of acacia trees next to Mount Sinai. When Israel came to Sinai, Moses told them that they would be spending a long time there. I have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 15:22.</i> that there was no cloud over them at this time.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">To shelter them from the elements.</i> Each one of them then made a booth. The princes made court-like structures, each one in accordance with his status. They cut the entire forest down, for they were a large nation. They made booths.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Out of the acacia wood.</i> Moses did not speak to them regarding the tabernacle until after the Day of Atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">After which he spoke to Israel regarding the construction of the tabernacle.</i> This is the meaning of <i>with whom was found</i> (Ex. 35:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is: with whom was found for his personal needs, the reference being to the wood which they had cut in order to construct their booths.</i>

Verse 6

OIL FOR THE LIGHT. Oil needed for the light in accordance with the requirements of the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>pure olive oil beaten for the light</i> (Ex. 27:20) (Filwarg).</i> The wise men of this generation say that <i>ve-liktoret ha-sammim</i> (and for the sweet incense)<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and for the incense (<i>li-ketoret</i>) of the perfumes (<i>ha-sammim</i>).</i> has to be inverted in order to be understood.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For the phrase “and for the incense (<i>li-ketoret</i>) of the perfumes” (<i>ha-sammim</i>) makes no sense.</i> Its meaning is, and the perfumes for the incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-liktoret ha-sammim</i> should be interpreted as if written <i>ve-sammim li-ketoret</i>.</i> Now if this is the case, then why didn’t Scripture say, for the anointing oil spices (<i>ve-le-shemen ha-mishchah besamim</i>)?<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than <i>besamim le-shemen ha-mishchah</i> (spices for the anointing oil.) The point is that since <i>ve-liktoret ha-sammim</i> (and for the sweat incense) is out of order, why isn’t the preceding phrase also out of order?</i> Furthermore, Scripture reads, <i>and the spice, and the oil, for the light</i> (ve’et ha-shamen le-ma’or), <i>and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense</i> (ve-liktoret hasammim)<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and for the incense of the perfume.</i> (Ex. 35:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Here too oil for the light is in order, and incense of the perfume is not.</i> I believe that the word <i>spices</i> (besamim)<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">In the phrase <i>spices for the anointing oil</i>.</i> takes in the spices needed for anointing oil and the spices that were mixed with the incense perfumes.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our text is to be understood as if written: <i>be-sammim le-shemen ha-mishchah u-ve-sammim li-ketoret ha-sammim</i> (spices for the anointing oil and spices for the incense of sweet incense).</i> This is also the true tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Received by the sages of the Talmud.

ONYX STONES. This includes all the stones of the ephod and the one of the breastplate.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The ephod had two onyx stones (Ex. 28:9) and the breastplate one (Ex. 28:20).</i>

However, in his comments on our verse in his short commentary, I.E. quotes three interpretations of the term <i>melu’im</i>, one of them to the effect that the stones covered the front of the <i>choshen</i>.</i>

Verse 8

AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY. The tabemacle is called a <i>mikdash</i> (a sanctuary)<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> because it is the tabernacle<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Or dwelling place.</i> of God the holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells Moses to construct a <i>mikdash</i>.

Verse 9

I SHOW THEE. You will see it with your eye. Unlike the visions of Ezekiel,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezek. 1:37; 1:40-47.</i> which were in prophetic dreams. Scripture adds the emphatic <i>heh</i> and reads <i>ha-mishkan</i> (the tabernacle) after it mentions the term sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>ha-mishkan</i> (the tabernacle) refers to the above-noted sanctuary. I.E.’s point is that Scripture does not command the making of a <i>mishkan</i>. It commands the making of a <i>mikdash</i>. Hence I.E. explains why the term <i>ha-mishkan</i> is used.</i>
[EVEN SO SHALL YE MAKE IT.] A <i>vav</i> is placed in front of the word <i>ken</i> (even so) in the phrase <i>ve-khen ta’asu</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and so shall ye make. “The expression <i>and so shall ye make it</i> thus refers only to <i>the pattern of all the furniture</i> (mentioned right above), but does not refer to <i>the pattern of the tabernacle</i>, since the term ‘making’ was already stated with reference to it, namely, <i>and let them make me a sanctuary</i>” (Chavel).</i> (even so shall ye make it)<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The context requires “so shall ye do,” that is, <i>ken ta’asu</i>. Our verse adds an extra <i>vav</i>.

Verse 10

AND THEY SHALL MAKE. Scripture begins by saying, <i>And they shall make an ark</i> because it had at first said, <i>And let them make Me a sanctuary</i> (v. 8).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, And they shall make Me a sanctuary. In other words, Scripture employs the same term <i>ve-asu</i> for the ark as it did for the sanctuary. It does so because it is the first vessel to be named. With regard to the making of the other articles of furniture, Scripture states, <i>And thou shalt make</i> (see Ex. 25:23,31; Ex. 26:1,31; Ex. 27:1,9. Hence I.E.’s comment. See <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 33:3.</i>
[TWO CUBITS AND A HALF SHALL BE THE LENGTH THEREOF, AND A CUBIT AND A HALF THE BREADTH THEREOF, AND A CUBIT AND A HALF THE HEIGHT THEREOF.] We do not know if these measurements refer to the outside or to the inside of the ark.

I.E. comments thus, for it is possible to interpret <i>and a cubit and a half shall be its height</i> as referring to the ark plus its legs.

He argues that the height for the ark given in our Torah portion does not relate only to the ark but to the ark plus the legs which he assumes the ark had. I.E. argues thus because he believed that it would be impossible for Moses to hold in his hands tablets of stones which measured a cubed cubit.</i> God gave strength to the hands of Moses, which were “heavy”<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Tired.

See note 81.</i> Perhaps it was so,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible that the tablets were engraved on only two sides.</i> for a tablet is a cube having six sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture points out that the Decalogue was written on only two of its sides.</i> We similarly find it written<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmud.</i> that there were three arks.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 72b. “Bezalel made three arks, two of gold, and one of wood…He placed the ark of wood inside the ark of gold, and the ark of gold inside the ark of wood. He covered its upper rim with gold. It was consequently overlaid within and without with gold.”</i> Its weight raises questions.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Bible the ark was carried by four men. I.E. questions the ability of four men to carry a piece of furniture constructed of three arks, two of which were made of solid gold.</i> Furthermore, the width of the ark cover<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the ark’s covering.</i> was a handbreadth<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbinic opinion. See <i>Sukkah</i> 5a. This too would add to the ark’s weight.</i> Additionally, we read in Scripture that the gold which was donated<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">By the Israelites for the construction of the tabernacle. See Ex. 38:24: <i>All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels</i>.</i> came to less than one thousand and four hundred parts of the gold which king David left.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">For Solomon to use in constructing the temple. See I Chron. 22:14: <i>Now, behold…I</i> [David] <i>have prepared for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold</i>. I.E. questions whether Moses had enough gold available to construct two arks of gold of the size described in our chapter.</i> Observe, the cherubim were made of olive wood.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the cherubim made by Solomon. See I Kings 6:23-28. The point is that Solomon had much more gold available than Moses did. Nevertheless, he made the cherubim out of olive wood overlaid with gold.</i> The incense altar was also not completely made of gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">It was made of wood overlaid with gold. See Ex. 30:1-5. Hence it is possible that the ark was also constructed in this fashion.</i> If we look at it logically, then it appears that the ark was covered with gold for appearance sake<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">So that it would look as if it was completely made of gold.</i> and that very little gold actually went into the covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the ark was not overly heavy. It should be noted that with the tablets inside, it still was of considerable weight.</i> Were not the boards, the bars, the table, and the incense altar all covered with gold? Nothing except for the menorah was made entirely of gold. Now once they made an ark out of gold, what need was there for wood?<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The wooden ark.</i> The fact that Solomon covered the porch and the house with gold demonstrates how the covering was actually done.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">So Filwarg. The point is, Solomon could not have thickly covered the walls of the temple with a thick layer of gold. He must have covered it with a very thin layer. We thus see that when one covers wood with gold, one does so very lightly.</i>

Verse 11

A CROWN OF GOLD. The word <i>zer</i> (crown) comes from the same root as the word <i>zareta</i> (you crowned) in, <i>You crowned my going about and my lying down</i> (Ps. 139:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E. See I.E. on Ps. 139:3.</i>

Verse 12

THE FOUR FEET THEREOF. I searched all of Scripture and did not find the word <i>pa’am</i> (foot) used in the sense of corner.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Onkelos renders, <i>pa’amotav</i> (feet thereof) <i>zivyateh</i> (its corners). So do Rashi and many others. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> It is always employed in the sense of a foot. We thus read: <i>Even the feet of the poor, and the steps</i> (pa’ame) <i>of the needy</i> (Is. 26:6); <i>And shall make His footsteps</i> (pe’amav) <i>a way</i> (Ps. 85:14); <i>How beautiful are thy steps</i> (fe’amayikh) (Cant. 7:2). There are many other instances. I was therefore forced to explain that the ark had feet,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">For the meaning of <i>pa’amotav</i> is, its feet.</i> for it would be disrespectful for the ark to sit on the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it rested on feet.</i> Furthermore, what reason is there for Scripture to place a connective <i>vav</i> before the word <i>u-shete</i> (and two) when dealing with the two rings of gold (v. 12)? If the reference was to the rings already mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">In the first half of the verse.</i> then Scripture should have read, <i>shete taba’ot</i> (two rings), as that is the proper syntax if the Torah wants to indicate that it is dealing with the four gold rings previously noted.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12 reads: <i>And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof</i> (pa’amotov); <i>and two rings</i> (u-shete ta’abotav) <i>shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it</i>. I.E. argues that <i>and two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it</i> does not refer to the four rings mentioned in the first part of the clause. If it did, our verse would read: And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof (<i>pa’amotav</i>): two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. There were thus eight rings on the ark. See Nahmonides who quotes I.E.’s interpretation and strongly disagreees with him.</i> One of the wise men of our generation understood this.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">That the second part of verse 12 does not elaborate upon the first part.</i> He says that the staves were placed in the ark in the rings that were on its feet. He further says that they would remove the staves from the lower rings and place them in the upper rings when it was necessary to carry the ark. It is similarly written, <i>and shall set the staves thereof</i> (Num. 4:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">According to this scholar, <i>and shall set the staves thereof</i> indicates that the staves were moved from time to time; i.e., they were placed in the top rings when the ark was about to be carried and were removed from the top rings and placed on the lower rings when the ark rested.</i> However, I believe that the staves were never removed once they were placed in the upper rings, for Scripture states, <i>they shall not be taken from it</i> (v. 15). As to <i>And shall set the staves thereof</i> (Num. 4:6), it means that the priests shall place the staves upon the shoulders of the Kohathites.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Not that the staves were at times placed in the upper rings and at other times in the lower rings.

Verse 16

AND THOU SHALT PUT. The tablets and the testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>edut</i>.</i> are one and the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. comments thus because some identify the testimony with the Torah. See Rashi, “The Testimony refers to the Torah, which is a testimony between Me and you that I have commanded you the commandments that are written in it.”</i> They were, as it were, a marriage contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">A marriage contract serves as a testimony that a marriage took place.</i> They were the tablets of testimony.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">That is why Scripture refers to the tablets as tablets of the covenant. See Deut. 9:9-11. It does so because the tablets recall God’s covenant with Israel. A marriage contract similarly recalls the covenant of marriage.</i> <i>And he took and put the testimony into the ark</i> (Ex. 40:20) is perfect proof of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">For it was the tablets that were placed in the ark.</i> Furthermore, Moses did not write the scroll of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Moses had not yet written the book of the Torah.

Hence the term testimony cannot refer to the Torah.</i> The scroll of the Torah was placed by the priests next to the outer side of the ark of the covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 31:26.</i> It is additionally written, <i>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone</i> (I Kings 8:9). There is a difference of opinion concerning this.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The tablets placed in the ark. Some rabbis believe that only the second pair of tablets was placed in the ark. Others believe that the first pair of tablets, which Moses broke, was also placed in the ark. See <i>Baba Batra</i> 14b. Also see Rashi on Deut. 31:26.</i> One may raise the following question. Scripture reports that God told Moses (v. 16), <i>And thou shalt put into the ark the tables</i><sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16 has <i>testimony</i> in place of tablets. I.E. is paraphrasing.</i> <i>which I shall give thee</i>. The Torah then tells us, <i>And He gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of speaking with him…the two tables of the testimony</i> (Ex. 31:18). Now Moses broke these tablets. Moses thus did not fulfill the command of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">The question arises: How could Moses, the servant of God, disobey His command?</i> It is possible to give the following answer. Perhaps this is the reason why our sages said that the broken tablets were placed in the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Baba Batra</i> 14b.</i> Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16 seems to speak of only one set of tablets.</i> does not contradict their words, for both the first and the second tablets were tablets of the covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Thus verse 16 also refers to the first tablets.</i> It is also possible to answer that Scripture (v. 16) speaks only about the second tablets. The statement <i>which I shall give thee</i> does not contradict this.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>prima facie</i>, this appears to apply only to the first set of tablets.</i> For Scripture also says concerning the second tablets, <i>And the Lord gave them unto me</i> (Deut. 10:4). Furthermore, note that we do not find that God told Moses that he should make an ark and place the first set of tablets there. For God knew that Moses would break them.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Hence God, who is omniscient, could not have been speaking of the first tablets in verse 16.</i> It was only concerning the tablets that Moses hewed<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the second tablets.</i> that God said, <i>and make thee an ark of wood</i> (Deut. 10:1). Now our sages said that <i>and make thee an ark of wood</i> does not refer to the ark made by Bezalel.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">See Jerusalem Talmud <i>Sotah</i> 8:3; <i>Shekalim</i> 6:5. Also see Rashi on Deut. 10:1. The rabbis took literally <i>and make thee an ark of wood</i>. That is, the ark was to be made only from wood. Hence it could not refer to the ark made by Bezalel, which was overlaid with gold. Bezalel’s ark is the ark dealt with in our chapter.</i> This is correct. However, if we follow the plain meaning of the text, then it does not appear to me to be far-fetched to interpret the text<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 10:1.</i> as referring to the ark which Bezalel constructed. Scripture similarly reads, <i>And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood</i> (v. 10).<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that Bezalel’s ark is also referred to as a wooden ark.</i> There is no reason to ask, where were these tablets placed before the tabernacle was constructed?<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">If the ark spoken of in our chapter is identified with the wooden ark spoken of in Deut. 10:1.</i> For there is no need to mention this.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">This information has no consequence.

Now if we assume that Moses relates the account as it happened,<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that we interpret Deut. 10:1,5 as meaning that Moses himself made an ark for the tablets and that this ark is not the one that Bezalel made (Krinsky).</i> even though we do not know the reason why he should mention this,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses made a wooden ark to temporarily store the tablets.</i> what shall we do with what follows, namely, <i>as the Lord commanded me</i> (Deut. 10:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">The only ark which we find God commanding Moses to make was the ark Bezalel made.

See note 112.</i> [Moses tells us that] these tablets are there<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">In the ark.</i> until this very day (<i>Ibid</i>.).<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they were permanently placed in the ark. The reference can only be to the ark made by Bezalel.</i> This is the meaning of <i>and there they are unto this very day</i> (I Kings 8:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">That the tablets are in the very first ark in which Moses placed them.</i> This<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And</i> [I] <i>put the tables in the ark which I had made</i> (Deut. 10:5).</i> is also a sign and a witness that there was no Torah scroll in the ark, for Moses first put the tablets in the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 10:5.</i> He then placed the ark cover with the cherubim over the ark. Now God’s glory dwelled upon the cherubim. Scripture explicitly reads, <i>Thou art enthroned upon the cherubim</i> (Ps. 80:2). This being the case, how could Moses place a Torah scroll inside the ark in the fortieth year without first removing the ark cover with the cherubim from on top of the ark?<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumed that once the ark was closed, Moses would not open it because God’s glory was upon it.</i> There is no need for all of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">If we reject the opinion that a Torah was in the ark.</i>

Verse 17

AND THOU SHALT MAKE AN ARK-COVER. The word <i>kapporet</i> means a cover. Yefet says that the word <i>le-khapper</i> (to make atonement) in <i>to make atonement for him</i> (Lev. 1:4) is similar. Its meaning is similar to <i>whose sin is covered</i><sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>le-khapper</i> means to cover, i.e., to cover someone’s sins.</i> (Ps. 32:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> However, I believe that the word <i>le-khapper</i> (<i>to make atonement for him</i>) (Lev. 1:4) is similar in meaning to the form <i>kofer</i> (ransom). Now this is clearly stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>le-khapper</i> in <i>le-khapper alav</i> (to make atonement for him) is similar to <i>kofer</i> (ransom).</i> for Scripture states, <i>then shall they give every man a ransom</i> (kofer) <i>for his soul unto the Lord</i> (Ex. 30:12). Scripture then goes on to say, <i>le-khapper al nafshotekhem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-khapper alav</i> is similar to <i>le-khapper al nafshotekhem</i> because both speak of people.</i> (to make atonement for your souls) (Ex. 30:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. this should be rendered, to offer a ransom for your souls.</i> Scripture does not mention the thickness of the ark cover.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comment on verse 10 and the notes thereto.</i>

Verse 18

AND THOU SHALT MAKE TWO CHERUBIM. Our sages said that the <i>cherubim</i> looked like two youths. They said that the <i>kaf</i> in <i>keruvim</i> is a preposition and the word <i>keruvim</i> (cherubim) means the same as the Aramaic word <i>ke-ravia</i> (like youths).<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 55b; <i>Hagigah</i> 13b. See I.E. on Gen. 3:22 and the notes thereto.</i> Now if they had a tradition that the cherubim were youth-like images, then what they said was true. They interpreted the word in a manner that would recall the tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that the word <i>keruvim</i> does not really mean like youths. However, the sages interpreted the word that way in order to recall their tradition.</i> They did the same with the word <i>chanukkah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis said that the word <i>chanukkah</i> is made up of the words <i>chanu kaf heh</i> [they rested on the 25th (of Kislev)]. This is obviously not the real meaning of the word <i>chanukkah</i>. The rabbis interpreted it that way so that people do not forget that Chanukkah falls on the 25th of Kislev.</i> The <i>kaf</i> in the word <i>keruv</i> (cherub) is a root letter,<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Not a preposition meaning like.</i> as the word <i>hakeruvim</i> (the cherubim) in <i>And the cherubim shall</i> (v. 20) proves.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>kaf</i> of <i>keruvim</i> was a preposition then Scripture would not read <i>ha-keruvim</i>, for the definite article is not prefixed to a preposition.</i> The <i>heh</i> of <i>ha-keruvim</i> indicates the definite article. It is not an interrogative <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>ha-keruvim</i> is, the cherubim.</i> like the <i>heh</i> in <i>ha-kemakkat</i> (or is he slain) in <i>Or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by Him</i> (Is. 27:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. comments thus because it is possible to place an interrogative <i>heh</i> before a prepositional <i>kaf</i>. Thus if the <i>heh</i> of <i>ha-keruvim</i> was an interrogative <i>heh</i>, there would be no proof that the <i>kaf</i> of <i>keruvim</i> is a root letter.</i> Now when I searched for the meaning of the word <i>keruvim</i> (cherubim) I found that it refers to various forms. Compare, <i>Thou wast the far-covering cherub</i> (keruv) (Ezek. 28:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a bird with large wings. We thus see that a cherub can refer to a bird-like image.</i> Ezekiel said that each one of the beasts which he beheld<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">When he saw the vision of the chariot.</i> had four faces (Ezek. 1:6). One of these faces was the face of an ox (Ezek. 1:10). However, elsewhere he describes this very creature as having the face of a cherub in place of the face of an ox (Ezek. 10:14). Its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of Ezek. 10:14.</i> is that the creature had the image that Ezekiel had mentioned earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">The face of an ox. In other words, By <i>the face of the cherub</i> (Ezek. 10:14), Ezekiel means it had the already mentioned image, namely, the image mentioned in Ezek. 1:6; i.e., it had the face of an ox. We thus see that the term cherub refers to an image.</i> At the end Ezekiel says, <i>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim</i> (Ezek. 10:20). Ezekiel thus called the four creatures cherubim. The <i>kaf</i> in the word <i>keruvim</i> thus is a root letter.
OF BEATEN WORK. <i>Mikshah</i> (of beaten work) means equal. The word <i>mikshah</i> (the same size) in <i>And instead of hair trimmed to the same size</i> (ma’aseh mikshah) <i>baldness</i><sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> (Is. 3:24)is similar. <i>Ma’aseh</i> (trimmed)<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">In Is. 3:24.</i> has the same meaning as <i>asah</i> (trimmed) in <i>nor trimmed his beard</i> (II Sam. 19:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ma’aseh</i> usually means work of. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>mikshah ta’aseh otam</i> (of beaten work shalt thou make them).</i> is that each cherub was equally distant from the edge of the ark cover.

Verse 19

CHERUB. Observe! The cherubs were positioned<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">In their face-to-face position.</i> on the long side of the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells us that the cherubim were placed at the two ends of the ark cover. According to I.E. the term end implies the long end (Meijler).</i> The staves were therefore placed to the width of the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">The Book of Kings tells us, <i>And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place, even before the Sanctuary</i> (I Kings 8:8). This could only have happened if the staves were placed along the width of the ark. For the long side of the ark was placed in a north-south direction in the sanctuary (so that both cherubim would face the Holy of Holies) while the curtain that separated the temple proper from the sanctuary was on the eastern wall of the sanctuary (Meijler).</i> There is someone who disagrees and says that <i>side</i> refers only to the long side.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells us that the staves were on the side of the ark (v. 12). Hence according to this scholar the staves, contra I.E., could not have been placed along the width of the ark.</i> He offers proof from <i>and for the second side of the tabernacle</i> (Ex. 26:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">The verse speaks of the length of the tabernacle.</i> However, <i>and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle</i> (Ex. 26:27), which is right next to the verse that he quotes, destroys his proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">For this verse speaks of the width of the tabernacle.</i> The cherubim which were upon the two edges of the ark were made out of the ark cover itself

Verse 20

AND THE CHERUBIM SHALL. Yefet says that the meaning of <i>toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be</i> means that the cherubim shall face the center of the ark cover. However, I believe that the faces of the cherubim did not stand erect,<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie, With their faces one to another</i> implies that the cherubim directly faced each other.</i> but rather inclined a bit towards the ark cover.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be</i> does not mean that the cherubim shall face straight down to the ark cover as Yefet says. It means that the faces of the cherubim shall incline toward the ark cover.</i>

Verse 21

AND IN THE ARK. This is in keeping with Hebrew syntax.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">To list first what comes last, for the tablets were placed in the ark before the cover was put on it. However, our verse tells of the latter before it tells of the former.</i> Moses had already put the testimonies into the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Before he put the ark cover over the ark.</i> He was told: afterwards<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">After you place the testimonies in the ark.</i> place the ark cover [over the ark].<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our verse is to be understood as follows: And thou shalt put the ark cover over the ark; but before this, in the ark thou shalt put the testimonies which I shall give you.</i>

Verse 22

AND THERE I WILL MEET WITH THEE. I do not understand in what way this verse contradicts <i>And the Lord called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying</i> (Lev. 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi our verse contradicts Lev. 1:1. See Rashi on verse 22: “[Scripture states] <i>And I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover</i> (Ex. 25:22). However, another verse reads, <i>and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting</i>, (that is, the tabernacle outside of the curtain) <i>saying</i> (Lev. 1:1). We thus find two verses contradicting each other. A third verse comes and reconciles them; viz<i>., And when Moses went into the tent of meeting…then he heard the Voice speaking unto him from above the ark-cover</i> (Num. 7:29). Moses entered the tabernacle and when he came to the entrance a Voice descended from heaven toward (the place) between the cherubim, and from thence it went forth and was heard by Moses in the tent of meeting.”</i> For the phrase <i>tent of meeting</i> takes in the tabernacle and everything in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it also refers to the Holy of Holies where the ark was.</i> There is no need for a clarifying<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Or reconciling.</i> verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">See note 184.</i>
[OF ALL THINGS WHICH I WILL GIVE THEE IN COMMANDMENT UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] The word et<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>et</i> has no translatable meaning.

We might also note that Rashi’s Torah scrolls also read <i>ve-et</i>. Rashi considered this <i>vav</i> superfluous.</i> for the following reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Without the <i>vav</i> our verse reads: <i>and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel</i>.

Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The word <i>ve-dibbarti</i> (and I will speak) is to be read as if written twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that our verse is to be read as follows: and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of testimony, and I will further speak to you of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</i> Our verse is to be read as if written: and I will speak with thee from above the ark cover, from between the two cherubim. Scripture does not mention what will be spoken.<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, part 2 of the verse does not tell us what part 1 of the verse refers to. This would not be the case if the word <i>et</i> did not have a <i>vav</i> before it.

We thus see that Scripture elaborates first on what it dealt with last.</i> God therefore began with an explanation of the tabernacle’s furniture.<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Because that is what is mentioned last in verse 9.</i> God started with the most important piece of furniture<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">The ark.</i> and then went on to the explain the table and the menorah. After this, God said, <i>Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle</i> (Ex. 26:1). Now when Moses gathered the congregation he spoke to them about the tabernacle and the tent first.<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 35:1; 11.</i> Then he told them about the ark. There was no need for anyone to teach Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">As to how to construct the tabernacle. Krinsky claims that the reference is to the Midrash, which says that Bezalel took issue with Moses over what order to follow in constructing the tabernacle.</i> There is reason to wonder why God didn’t mention the altar of incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">In our Torah portion. It is mentioned in Ex. 35:15. However, it should also have been mentioned here along with the other furniture that was placed inside the tabernacle.</i> The answer by way of parable is:<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s point is that the tabernacle may be compared to a king’s palace. Indeed, Scripture states that the tabernacle served as a dwelling place for God, <i>let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them</i> (v. 8). Hence it had to be suitably furnished.</i> God’s glory did not depart [from the tabernacle].<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the tabernacle served, as it were, as God’s dwelling place.</i> The ark was therefore in the form of a throne.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">For God, who dwelt there.</i> Observe, a menorah and a prepared table [were placed in the sanctuary].<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">They served to furnish God’s house. A table and a lamp were the typical furnishings of a house. See II Kings 4:10, “Let us make…a little chamber on the roof; and let us set…there…a table…and a candlestick.”.</i> God did not mention the altar of incense until He first mentioned the altar of the burnt offering, because God wanted to issue the command, <i>You shall offer no…burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon</i> (Ex. 30:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">He couldn’t issue this command without first dealing with burnt offerings, meal offerings, or drink offerings.

Verse 23

CLOSE BY THE BORDER. Scripture mentions the place where the rings were to be placed.

Verse 28

THAT THE TABLE MAY BE BORNE WITH THEM. <i>Venissa</i> (may be borne) is a <i>nifal. Ve-nissa</i> is similar to <i>ve-nikkah</i> (be quit) in <i>then shall he that smote him be quit</i> (Ex. 21:19).

Verse 29

AND THOU SHALT MAKE. What the rabbis said is known.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis (<i>Menachot</i> 97a) said that <i>“ke’arotav</i> (its dishes) are the molds; <i>kapotav</i> (its pans) are dishes (of frankincense); <i>kesotav</i> (its jars) the props; <i>menakki’otav</i> (its bowls) the rods; <i>asher yussakh ba-hen</i> (wherewith to pour) wherewith the bread was covered.” Also see Rashi. Contra to what Krinsky, Meijler, and others write, it appears that I.E. does not accept the Rabbinic interpretation. In fact, in the short commentary he renders <i>kesotav</i> as cups (<i>kosot</i>).</i>
[WHEREWITH TO POUR OUT.] The phrase <i>wherewith to pour out</i> refers to <i>the jars thereof</i> (kesotav).<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>kesavot</i> are jars used in pouring.</i> It does not relate to <i>and the bowls thereof</i>, which immediately precedes it.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">For they were not used for pouring.</i> The following is similar: <i>Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among them</i> (Ps. 99:6). Scripture then goes on to say, <i>He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud</i> (Ps. 99:7). The latter refers to Moses and Aaron, not to Samuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">For God did not speak to Samuel in the pillar of cloud. We thus see that a clause does not always refer to what immediately precedes it.</i> The fact that Scripture says with regard to the making of the vessels, <i>the jars thereof</i> (ha-kesot) <i>wherewith to pour out</i> (Ex. 37:16) proves that <i>wherewith to pour out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> refers to <i>the jars thereof</i>. So does <i>and the jars</i> (kesot) <i>wherewith to pour out</i> (Num. 4:7). The word <i>nasakh</i> (pour) has many meanings. We thus read, <i>They shall not pour out wine-offerings</i> (nesekh) <i>to the Lord</i> (Hos. 9:4);<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text literally reads: They shall not pour out wine (<i>yayyin</i>) to the Lord.

In keeping with his theory that the long commentary was composed by students of I.E. from notes taken at their master’s lectures, he claims that the students misunderstood what I.E. said (See <i>Toledot Rabbenu Natan</i>, S.Y.

He comments, “Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: ‘There is an error in Chronicles…’ The error, however, is in Rabbi Abraham’s words (not in the Book of Chronicles)” (Chavel translation). Nahmanides goes on to say that I Chron 28:17 does not speak only of the utensils made for the table but also of other utensils made for the altar. It should be noted that I.E. goes on to reconcile I Chron. 28:17 and our verse.

Abraham the author says: All that exists, exists in one of the following two ways. One, it exists as a body that has length, width, and depth. The aforementioned results in six sides. From the length of an object comes front and back, from its width right and left, and from its height<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Referred to earlier by I.E.</i> up and down. There are also incorporeal beings, namely, God’s holy angels and man’s soul. These two types of beings<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">Corporeal and incorporeal beings.</i> were created by God alone. It is not in the power of any created being to create a corporeal being. It is certainly beyond the power of any being to create an incorporeal being, for incorporeal beings are more important than corporeal beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">Hence if it is beyond the power of any created being to create a corporeal being, it is certainly beyond its power to create an incorporeal being.</i> It is also beyond the power of any created being to totally annihilate another being <sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">One can destroy a physical object but one cannot annihilate the matter out of which it is made.</i> There is something which comes very close to existence and is tied to existence but does not exist independently.<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">According to medieval philosophy, ideas and concepts have a life of their own.

However, there are places in the human body such as the eyes or the nose that are more sensitive than others because of the nerves that go out from the brain. The bones and liver are devoid of sensation. Now the heart is more receptive to the power of the soul than are all other organs of the body. Many organs therefore serve it. Similarly with the glorious God. We know that God’s glory fills the world. However, there are places where God’s power is more manifest than in other places. This is so for the following two reasons. Divine manifestation varies in accordance with the natural makeup of the recipient and in accordance with the upper power that is above the receiver.<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">Some people and some places on earth are created in such a way that they are more open to God’s revelation than other people or places are. See I.E. on Gen. 28:16. This is also the opinion of Rabbi Judah ha-Levi. See Book II of the <i>Kuzari</i>.</i> Therefore, the place of the holy temple [Mount Moriah] was chosen.<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is under God’s special presence and open to it.</i> If God will give you wisdom, then you will understand the secret of the ark, the ark covering, and the cherubim which spread their wings.<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">The ark and the cherubim which were placed in the Holy of Holies represent God’s throne (Meijler). It is also possible that I.E. believed that the ark was constructed in such a way that it drew power from above and thus served to channel God’s word to Moses. See I.E. on Ex. 31:18.</i> You will also understand the secret of the objects which were placed outside of the curtain,<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">In the tabernacle proper.</i> namely, the menorah, the incense altar, and the table.<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">They served, as it were, as furniture in God’s house (Meijler).

See end of I.E.’s comment.</i> You will also comprehend the secret of the objects placed outside of the opening of the tabernacle, namely, the altar of the burnt offering and its utensils and the basin and its base. These objects served to honor God. I gave you these hints because there are many people in our generations who think they are wise. Perhaps they will mock my words. He who knows the secret of his soul and the makeup of his body is able to understand the workings of the upper world. This is so because man is a microcosm. Man was the last thing created by God when he created the earth.

Verse 1

MOREOVER THOU SHALT MAKE THE TABERNACLE. As you were first told, namely, <i>the pattern of the tabernacle</i> (Ex. 25:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was told to make the tabernacle according to the pattern which he had been shown earlier. I.E. comments thus because Scripture reads, <i>ha-mishkan</i> (the tabernacle), i.e., the earlier-noted tabernacle, rather than tabernacle (Krinsky).</i>
THE WORK OF THE SKILLFUL WORKMAN. Our sages said that <i>ma’aseh choshev</i> (the work of the skillful workman) refers to two faces, and [<i>ma’aseh</i>] <i>rokem</i> (the work of the weaver) (v. 36)<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yoma</i> 72:b: “It was taught in the name of Rabbi Nehemiah <i>rokem</i> (weaving) is needlework, therefore it has only one face. <i>Choshev</i> is weaving work, therefore it has two faces.” According to Rashi, one face means the same image on both sides of the curtain. Two faces means a different image on each side of the curtain, e.g., “a lion on one side, and an eagle on the other side.” Also see Rashi on <i>Yoma</i> 72b.</i> to one image. What they said is correct. However, according to the plain meaning of the text, <i>ma’aseh choshev</i> is neither needle-work nor weaving.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. needlework or weaving did not entail artistic skill. Hence it could not be considered <i>ma’aseh choshev</i>, which literally means the work of an artist.</i> It refers rather to a process employed today in making silk garments. The image that arises in the heart comes from insight and thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and its thought. Hebrew, <i>machashvtah</i> (and its thought).

Meijler suggests that some words might be missing from our texts. Rabbi Isaac Sarim (<i>Be’er Yitzchak</i>, Israel, 1991) comments, “I was not worthy to understand his (I.E.’s) holy words. One has to be an expert silk worker to understand his words.” According to Weiser, I.E. is describing the transfer of an image from a wooden tablet to silk. This is done by holding the tablet over the silk by two threads (or chords) and then dropping it, thus imprinting it upon the screen.</i>

However, actually there were ten curtains over the tabernacle to correspond with <i>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain</i> (Ps. 104:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the ten curtains of the tabernacle corresponded to the heavens which contain the ten spheres.

Verse 3

COUPLED. <i>Choverot</i> (coupled) is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, is in the form of an adjective.

Verse 4

LOOPS.

Thus <i>chayyat ha-sadeh</i> (animals of the field) is short for <i>chayyot shel hasadeh</i> (animals of the field).

AND THOU SHALT MAKE. Observe! Scripture does not record the thickness of the boards. The ancients<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis of the Talmud.

This was also the case with the northern wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The southern and northern walls of the tabernacle consisted of 20 boards, each of which was 1 1/2 cubits in width.</i> Thus a space measuring eight cubits in width<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The tabernacle was 10 cubits in width. This can be ascertained from the size of the fabric and goats’ hair curtains which covered the tabernacle. These curtains were 28 and 30 cubits long.

I.E. believed that the tabernacle was 10 cubits in width and 30 in length only as measured from the outside.</i> However, eight boards<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See verses 22 and 23.</i> had to be placed there.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Each of which was 1 1/2 cubits wide.

I.E. will later explain that the space on the west measured about 10 cubits and that only six of the eight boards measured 1 1/2 cubits.</i> It is possible that the ancients were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick. They were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick because of the middle bar<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 28. According to the Talmud this middle bar was inserted into the boards themselves.</i> which was inserted into the boards.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">There are those who would emend to: It is possible they were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick because of the middle bar which was inserted into the boards (Krinsky). It should be noted that the text of this chapter appears to be especially corrupt due to the difficulty of understanding I.E.’s comments.</i> According to Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi.</i> the bar could only lay there by a miracle.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud <i>Sabbath</i> 98b, “It (the middle bar) lay there by miracle” (Soncino translation). Rashi in his comments on the Talmud explains that one long middle bar was placed into one of the boards and it miraculously snaked around all three sides of the tabernacle. This comment is not in our editions of Rashi on the Pentateuch. In our editions, Rashi merely notes that a separate middle bar was inserted into each of the three sides of the tabernacle. I.E. probably quoted Rashi from memory and attributed to him here what he wrote in his commentary on the Talmud.</i> According to the plain meaning of the text there were three middle bars.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">That is, each had its own separate middle bar.</i> Scripture similarly writes, <i>from end to end</i> (v. 28).<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The middle bar reached from end to end.</i> It does not state<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Which it would if one middle bar encircled all the sides of the tabernacle.</i> from end<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That is, from one end.</i> to the ends.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">To all the other ends.</i> Now if the sages received a tradition that the boards were a cubit in thickness, then we will accept their tradition. However, if they arrived at this measurement by reasoning, then we can explain it differently. The two bars, namely, the upper two bars, and likewise the two lower bars,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Each wall of the tabernacle had five bars (v. 27). I.E. explains that there were two top bars, two bottom bars, and one middle bar.</i> reached half of the wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">One of the top bars was placed along half the length of the walls of the tabernacle starting from one direction. Another was placed in the same position starting from the other side. They met in the center. The bottom bars were similarly placed. A middle bar which extended from one end to the other end was placed between the upper and lower bars.</i> The middle bar that was placed <i>in the midst</i> (be-tokh) <i>of the boards</i> (v. 28) passed through from end to end.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the middle bar was not inserted into the boards.

It can be taken to mean midpoint or between. Thus in Ex. 39:3, <i>be-tokh</i> (in the midst) means among. Similarly, in verse 28 <i>be-tokh ha-kerahsim</i> does not mean in the very midst of the board’s body but rather at the midpoint of the board’s outer surface.</i> as is <i>and put the bells in the midst</i> (be-tokh) <i>of the pomegranates</i><sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, put the bells between the pomegranates.</i> (Ex. 39:25).

Now, they first set up the western wall.

Now these two corner boards were not the same size as the other boards mentioned in Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">All the boards of the tabernacle were 1 1/2 cubits in width. These two boards were a little more than half a cubit.

The tabernacle was erected by utilizing these two boards. The remaining six boards<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Western boards.</i> were placed in the middle.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Between the two corner boards.</i> The width of the tabernacle was thus ten cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">The six boards came to 9 cubits.

One half a cubit of each one of the corner boards filled the remaining open spaces left over after the six boards were placed on the western side of the tabernacle (see note 108). See Rashi on verse 23.</i> We are dealing with boards, not with garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, there is no way that a board measuring 1 1/2 cubits can be squeezed into a space measuring half a cubit.</i> They then<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">After setting up the western wall of the tabernacle.</i> set up the boards on the northern and southern sides.

The priest can stand next to the altar and offer the sacrifices. As I.E. points out, the height of an average person is 4 cubits. It should be noted that according to the Talmudic sage Rabbi Judah, the altar was 3 cubits high above the ledge which went all around the altar, and the entire altar was 10 cubits in height. See <i>Zevachim</i> 59b. Also see Rashi.</i> what then will the opponents of the sages<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Who maintain that the altar had no ramp.

That altar was ten cubits high<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See II Chron. 4:1.</i> whereas the height of a person is only four cubits.
[FOUR-SQUARE.] Scripture describes the altar as being <i>ravu’a</i> (four-square) because the length of the altar was the same as its width.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The altar was 3 cubits in height. Hence I.E. comments that the altar was only square with regard to its length and width. This comment is found in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38, in Weiser, and in some other editions. It is omitted by most <i>mikra’ot gedolot</i> editions.</i>

CORNERS. The word <i>pinnot</i> means corners. 

Verse 3

[TO TAKE AWAY ITS ASHES.] The meaning of <i>ledasheno</i> is, to take away its ashes. The meaning of <i>yedasheneh</i> (accept the fat) in <i>And accept the fat of thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah</i> (Ps. 20:4) is, he shall make ashes out of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., Ps. 20:4 should be rendered: and make ashes out of your burnt offerings.</i> Its meaning is that the sacrifice will be burnt on the altar and accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">By God.</i> Observe the word <i>tedashen</i> (make fat) in <i>maketh the bones fat</i> (Prov. 15:30). They all belong to the same<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Our texts read, to a different form. However, this reading is impossible, as <i>le-dasheno, yedasheneh</i>, and <i>tedashen</i> are all <i>pi’els</i>. Hence the commentaries suggest emending <i>acher</i> (different) to <i>echad</i> (one or same). See Filwarg, Krinsky, and Weiser. It should be noted that the <i>Margoli’ot Tuvah</i> edition of I.E. reads <i>echad</i> rather than <i>acher</i>.</i> conjugational form,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Although their meaning differs. I.E. points out that the root <i>dalet, shin, nun</i> in the <i>pi’el</i> form can have a number of meanings: to take away ashes, to turn into ashes, and to fatten.</i> namely, the <i>pi’el</i>. The meaning of <i>tedashen</i> is to fatten, as in As <i>for Asher, his bread shall be fat</i> (Gen. 49:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 49:20 is not a proof text, as the word <i>deshen</i> does not appear in it. I.E. merely uses it in order to define the word <i>tedasheno</i>. I.E. literally reads: <i>tedashen</i> has the same meaning as, <i>As for Asher, his bread shall be fat</i>.</i>
AND ITS SHOVELS. The word <i>ve-ya’av</i> (and its shovels) is similar to the word <i>ve-ya’ah</i> (shall sweep away) in <i>And the hail shall sweep away</i> (Is. 28:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>ve-ya’av</i> literally means: and its sweepers.

Verse 4

A GRATING. The word <i>mikhbar</i> (a grating) is similar in meaning to the word <i>kevarah</i> (sieve) (Amos 9:9).
BRASS. The word <i>brass</i> (nechoshet) is connected [to the word <i>grating</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Not to <i>reshet</i> (network), which precedes it, for <i>reshet</i> (network) is connected to <i>ma’aseh</i>, not to <i>nechoshet</i>.

[HOLLOW WITH PLANKS.] <i>Nevuv luchot</i> (hollow with planks) is to be explained in accordance with the Aramaic translation.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Onkelos. Onkelos renders <i>nevuv luchot</i> as <i>chalil luche</i> (hollow with planks).</i> The phrase <i>ve-ish nevuv yillavev</i> (But an empty man will get understanding) (Job 11:12) is similar, for <i>ish nevuv</i> means an empty person, that is, a person lacking intelligence. The verse is similar to the aphorism, a head without a brain. The laver<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 30:17-21.</i> is not mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In this Torah portion.

Verse 9

AND THOU SHALT MAKE. We find that Scripture says, <i>kedemah mizrachah</i> (on the east side eastward) (v. 13).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In speaking of the east, Scripture in verse 13 uses the phrase <i>kedemah mizrachah</i>. Now since both <i>kedem</i> and <i>mizrach</i> mean east, Scripture should have read <i>kedemah</i> or <i>mizrachah</i>. The question thus arises, why did Scripture employ the phrase <i>kedemah mizrachah</i>? I.E. brings up this issue here since Scripture uses the phrase <i>negev temanah</i> (south…southwards). Here too the question arises, why employ the phrase <i>negev temanah</i> when both <i>negev</i> and <i>teman</i> mean south?</i> We know that there are three “heads” to the east.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The eastern sky is divided into three sections. Each section is called a “head.” The sun rises at various places in the eastern sky at different times of the year.</i> The first is opposite the point of the head of Capricorn,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The eastern sky consists of the constellations Aries, Taurus, and Gemini. The northern sky consists of Cancer, Leo, and Virgo. The western sky consists of Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius. The southern sky consists of Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Capricorn is located in the southwestern section of the heavens. Aries lies in the southeastern part of the sky. The first “head” of the east begins at a point in the southeastern sky directly opposite the constellation of Capricorn.</i> which is the furthermost southern position of the sun. The second<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Head of the east.</i> is opposite the celestial equator, which is the head of Aries and Libra.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The celestial equator extends from Aries to Libra.</i> The third is opposite the head of Cancer, which is the sun’s furthermost northern position.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>kedemah mizrachah</i> refers to the middle portion of the eastern sky. So Krinsky. I.E. comments thus because in his opinion the tabernacle corresponded to the heavens. Thus <i>kedemah mizrachah</i> corresponded to a certain portion of the heavens. Weiser claims that <i>kedemah mizrachah</i> refers to the entire eastern side.</i> The same applies to the phrase <i>negbah temanah</i> (south…southward)<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Which our verse employs. Actually our verse reads, <i>negev temanah</i>. I.E. used the term <i>negbah temanah</i> because verse 18 reads <i>kedemah mizrachah</i>.</i> in the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The southern part of the sky also has three “heads.” The phrase <i>negbah temanah</i> refers to the middle portion of the southern sky. So Krinsky. For other interpretations see Weiser.</i>
SOUTHWARD. The word <i>temanah</i> (southward)<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the word <i>teman</i> (south).</i> comes from the same root as <i>yamin</i> (south). Compare, <i>The north and the south</i> (yamin), <i>Thou hast created them</i> (Ps. 89:13). 

Verse 10

[AND THEIR FILLETS.] The meaning of <i>chashukehem</i> (their fillets) is their attachments, the hooks being attached to the pillars.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The fillets, like the hooks, were attached to the pillars. See Rashi: “The pillars were encompassed by threads of silver round about.”</i> <i>Va-tidbak nafsho</i> (and his soul did cleave) (Gen. 34:3) means the same as <i>chashekah nafsho</i> (his soul longeth) (Gen. 34:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible first says <i>va-tidbak nafsho</i>. It then repeats the same account. However, in the latter it employs <i>chashekah nafsho</i> in place of <i>va-tidbak nafsho</i>. We thus see that <i>davak</i> and <i>chashak</i> have the same meaning.</i>

Verse 12

AND FOR THE BREADTH…FIFTY CUBITS. The width of the courtyard was thus half of its length.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The courtyard was 100 cubits long.</i> The commentaries tell us that the tabernacle was placed fifty cubits westward.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">From the eastern wall of the courtyard. See <i>Eruvin</i> 23b. “He placed the tabernacle (which measured 30 by 20 cubits) at the edge of fifty cubits (i.e., 50 cubits inwards) so that there was fifty cubits in front of the tabernacle and twenty cubits around the sides.”</i> Now its width was fifty cubits. This is what <i>and the breadth fifty every where</i> (v. 18) means. However, I believe that the meaning of <i>the breadth fifty every where</i> is that the courtyard was a right-angled parallelogram,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>me-rov orekh zavyotav nitzavot</i>. Literally, because of its many long right angles. In other words, the courtyard was a parallelogram that measured 50 cubits in width. Such a structure is 50 cubits in breadth <i>every where</i>, i.e., all along its width. Meijler suggests emending <i>me-rov orekh zavyotav nitzavot</i> (because of the length of its many angles) to <i>meruva orekh zavyotav nitzavot</i> (a right-angled parallelogram). <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 reads: <i>merchav arokh zeviyot</i>, which means a right-angled parallelogram. This reading seems to be the most correct. Be that as it may, according to I.E. the import of our verse is that the tabernacle courtyard was not tapered but measured 100 by 50 cubits.</i> and its width was fifty cubits on all sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For the meaning of <i>the breadth fifty every where</i> is that its width did not vary.</i> There is no necessity to explain <i>the breadth fifty every where</i> as referring to the side of the courtyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the eastern side of the courtyard (Filwarg). I.E. takes issue with the rabbis who held that the courtyard on the east side of the tabernacle was a 50 by 50-cubit square, as the tabernacle was placed 50 cubits inwards from the eastern wall of the courtyard.

Verse 20

AND THOU SHALT COMMAND. I will first note the reason for the position of this Torah portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Why the Torah portion <i>Tetzavveh</i> follows the Torah portion <i>Terumah</i>.</i> After God finished enumerating all the holy utensils, the veil, the tabernacle, the tent, the cover, the altar of the burnt offering, the courtyard, and the screen,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">All of the aforementioned are enumerated in <i>Terumah</i>.</i> He commenced<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Tetzavveh</i>.</i> to deal with those who ministered in the tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the <i>kohanim</i>, the priests.</i> He explained the service which they alone were to perform. No stranger was permitted to perform the service alongside them. God opened<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Our Torah portion.</i> with the command that they<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The priests.</i> cause a lamp to burn using pure olive oil. They were not to employ any other oil. It is only fitting that those who ministered in the tabernacle were to be distinguished and set apart, both in family and in dress.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">From the rest of the nation.</i> Scripture lists the garments one after the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Krinsky.</i> Scripture then mentions that those who served in the tabernacle were obligated to learn the service during the seven days of consecration. Moses was to teach and train them. After this, the priests would serve in the tabernacle. They would offer the daily burnt offering on the altar of the burnt offering. They were not to offer it upon the golden altar. The priests were to offer only incense upon the golden altar and to make atonement upon its horns once a year.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 30:7-10.</i> 
<i>And thou shalt command</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light</i>.</i> means that there is an eternal command upon the congregation to continually provide olive oil to kindle a perpetual light. Do not be troubled by the oil which the princes<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 35:27,28.</i> brought.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This indicates that the oil is brought by the individual rather than by the congregation.</i> It was anointing oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than oil for the light. However, Scripture explicitly states that the princes brought oil <i>for the light, and for the anointing oil</i> (Ex. 35:28). Krinsky explains that only the princes had pure olive oil in the desert (see I.E. on Ex. 35:27). Hence after the princes donated the oil to be used for anointing oil, some of it was utilized for the light.</i> The congregation, on the other hand, was obligated to bring oil for the light. There is a practice in countries where olives grow to choose pure olives, that is, olives that do not have any rot on them or olives that have not been partially eaten. These olives are then used to make oil for the king’s food. This is the reason that Scripture mentions <i>pure</i><sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Pure refers to the olives, not to the oil. According to I.E. our verse should be interpreted as follows: that they bring unto thee olive oil, from pure olives beaten for the light.</i> before <i>beaten</i>.
FOR THE LIGHT. For the light needed during the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets <i>la-ma’or</i> (for the light) as: needed for the light. He then elaborates: needed for the light at night.</i>
TO CAUSE A LAMP TO BURN. To kindle the lamps.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Le-ha’alot ner</i> (to cause a lamp to burn) literally means to cause a lamp to go up.</i> Scripture states, <i>that they should burn</i><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>le-va’aram</i>.</i><i>according to the ordinance</i> (II Chron. 4:20) concerning Solomon’s candelabra.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the use of the term <i>le-va’aram</i> with regard to Solomon’s candelabra shows that <i>le-ha’alot</i> used in connection with Moses’ menorah means to kindle.</i>
[CONTINUALLY.] The meaning of <i>tamid</i> (continually) is nightly.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">For the menorah did not burn continually. The word <i>tamid</i> means continually. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> There is a more difficult usage of the term <i>tamid</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a use of the term which presents us with greater problems than the one in our verse.</i> namely, <i>and it shall be always</i> (tamid) <i>upon his forehead</i> (Ex. 28:38).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">For the Bible explicitly states that the holy plate shall always be on the high priest’s head. However, in our verse the phrase <i>ner tamid</i> is merely descriptive.</i> The meaning of the latter is that the holy plate shall always be upon the miter whenever the miter is placed upon the head of the high priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>always</i> means whenever the miter is worn by the high priest.</i>

Verse 21

WHICH IS BEFORE THE TESTIMONY. <i>The testimony</i> is short for the ark of testimony. Yefet says that <i>ya’arokh</i> (shall set)<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>ayin, resh, kaf</i>. This root can mean to estimate or to arrange.

Verse 1

AND BRING THOU.

[THAT THEY MAY MINISTER UNTO ME.] The <i>vav</i> in <i>lekhahano</i> (that they minister) in <i>that they may minister unto me</i> is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>vav</i> in <i>le-khahano</i> is not a pronominal suffix, and <i>le-khahano</i> has the same meaning as <i>le-khahen</i>.</i> It is like the <i>vav</i> in <i>chayeto</i> (beast)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chayeto</i> has the same meaning as <i>chayat</i>.

Hence they were given the many cities enumerated in the Book of Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">According to Josh. 20:19, 13 cities were set aside for the priests.</i>

Verse 2

AND THOU SHALT MAKE HOLY GARMENTS. They are called holy garments because they were worn during the sanctuary service. On the other hand, it is possible that they were called holy garments in accordance with <i>that they sanctify not the people with their garments</i> (Ezek. 44:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the garments had the power to sanctify those whom they touched; the garments per se were holy.</i> The garments of Aaron referred to in our verse are the ones which Scripture later enumerates.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 4.</i>
FOR SPLENDOUR AND FOR BEAUTY. They shall glorify<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Or beautify.</i> themselves with these garments, for no other Israelite shall wear similar garments.

Verse 3

AND THOU SHALT. The <i>vav</i> in <i>milletiv</i> (I have filled)<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Which is in the singular.</i> refers to <i>lev</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Which is in the singular.</i> (hearted).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase <i>chakhme lev</i> (wise-hearted) precedes <i>milletiv</i> (I have filled it). Since <i>chakhme</i> is plural, Scripture should have read <i>milletim</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment that <i>milletiv</i> refers to <i>lev</i>, which is singular.</i>

Verse 4

AND THESE ARE THE GARMENTS. Scripture first mentions the breastplate, which was worn over the ephod, which was worn over the robe.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Scripture first describes the priestly garments in the order in which they were removed when the high priest undressed.</i> It then mentions the tunic and the girdle<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture next describes the garments in the order in which Aaron donned them, namely, tunic, mitre, and girdle (Filwarg).</i> which went around it<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The order is tunic, mitre, and girdle.

Moses then placed the robe upon Aaron. He then placed the ephod upon the robe and <i>put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod and bound it unto him therewith</i> (Lev. 8:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That is, with the band of the ephod.</i> The skillfully woven band was part of the ephod.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the end of the verse, Moses <i>bound it</i> [the ephod] <i>unto him</i> [Aaron] <i>therewith</i>.</i> The ephod was so called because of the skillfully woven band.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The word ephod means to girdle (Krinsky).</i> Moses dressed Aaron according to the order described in our verse.

See Vol. 1, p. xvi, item 4.</i> The meaning of <i>and clothed him with garments</i> (Zech. 3:5) is similar; i.e., they had already clothed him. For Scripture previously states, <i>So they set a fair mitre upon his head</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Zech. 3:4,5 reads: <i>Take the filthy garments from off him…And I will clothe thee with robes.

However, when Scripture describes what actually happened it says, <i>So they seta fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments</i> (Zech. 3:5). The latter implies that the mitre was put on before the garments. Hence I.E.’s interpretation that <i>and clothed him with garments</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.) means, and they had already clothed him.</i>

Verse 5

AND THEY SHALL TAKE THE GOLD. The wise-hearted who made the priestly garments were trustworthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the materials for the sacred garments were not measured out to the “wise hearted-men.” On the contrary, on their own they <i>took the gold, the blue</i>, etc. (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 6

AND THEY SHALL MAKE THE EPHOD. Scripture starts with the ephod<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Even though in verse 4 it mentioned the breastplate first.</i> because it was larger than the breastplate. The Torah tells us <i>that the breastplate be not loosed from</i> the skilfully woven band of <i>the ephod</i> (v. 28).<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This shows that the breastplate was smaller than the ephod, for the smaller object is normally attached to a larger one.</i> There are some very difficult questions relating to the ephod and the breastplate. Moses only made one ephod.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the Torah implies that there was only one ephod, the one made by Moses. I.E. was especially bothered by the problem of the many ephods cited in Scripture.</i> However, Scripture states, <i>that he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Abiathar.</i> <i>came down with an ephod in his hand</i> (I Sam. 23:6). The latter does not refer to the ephod made by Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This verse implies that other ephods were employed in ancient Israel.</i> for Scripture does not read “the ephod,”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I Sam 23:6 reads “<i>an</i> ephod,” not “<i>the</i> ephod in his hand.”</i> the meaning of which is, the well-known ephod,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the ephod made by Moses. According to I.E. ephod means an ephod. The ephod, with the definite article prefixed to it, is the ephod made by Moses. See I.E. on Gen. 31:19, note 30.</i> as it does when it states, <i>“Bring hither the ephod”</i> (I Sam. 23:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The reference being to the ephod made by Moses.</i> Furthermore, why does Scripture state, <i>he came down</i>, but it does not say he brought down? It thus appears that the ephod was accidentally among his possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>that he came down with an ephod in his hand</i> implies that Abiathar happened to have an ephod which he brought down, whereas if Scripture had read: that he brought down the ephod in his hand, it would have implied that Abiathar deliberately brought down <i>the</i> ephod. In the latter case, the reference would be to the ephod made by Moses.</i> Additionally, Scripture there states, <i>fourscore persons</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical text has <i>fourscore and five</i>. If it is not a scribal error, then I.E. quoted from memory and erred.</i> <i>that did wear a linen</i> (bad) <i>ephod</i> (I Sam. 22:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that there were 80 ephods.</i> Many commentaries explain this verse as meaning that the <i>persons</i><sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken of in I Sam. 22:18.</i> were fit to wear the ephod.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod</i> means fourscore and five persons who were fit to wear a linen ephod. In other words, they did not actually wear an ephod but were worthy of wearing the ephod made by Moses.</i> However, they did not bother to learn the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Their interpretation does not solve the problem of there being more than one ephod.</i> A <i>bad</i> (linen) ephod is an ephod made from a type of flax. However, the ephod made by Moses was not made of <i>bad</i> (linen).<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Hence I Sam. 22:18 cannot be interpreted as meaning that the priests were worthy of wearing the ephod made by Moses.</i> It was made of gold, blue wool, purple wool, and scarlet, with <i>shesh</i> (linen)<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shesh</i> is a high quality linen.</i> intertwined with all of the aforementioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, even though our verse states that the ephod made by Moses contained linen it was not made wholly out of linen. It was made out of all the material enumerated in our verse (Weiser).</i> They only inquired of the breastplate of judgment which had the Urim and Thummim upon it.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This introduces another problem connected with the ephod. Namely, it is clear from most places in Scripture that questions concerning future actions were directed to the Urim and Thummim, which were placed in the breastplate of judgment, which was placed on the ephod. However, David inquired of Abiathar’s ephod in Ziklag. Now as I.E. later shows, Abiathar’s ephod is not to be identified with Moses’ ephod. Thus in addition to the problem of a multiplicity of ephods, the question arises as to how these other ephods worked, as these ephods did not have the Urim and Thummim attached to them.</i> Scripture similarly writes, <i>by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord</i> (Num. 27:21). <i>Bring hither the ephod</i> (I Sam. 23:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Spoken by David who asked: will <i>the men of Keilah deliver me up into his</i> [Saul’s] <i>hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard?</i> (I Sam. 23:11).</i> does not present a counterargument<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Prima facie</i>, this verse implies that the ephod itself served as the instrument by which God’s will was divined.</i> because the breastplate was connected to it. The Urim<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">And Thummim. See next note.</i> went along with the breastplate.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it was the Urim and Thummim which served to reveal God’s will.</i> We similarly read, <i>till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim</i> (Neh. 7:65). Scripture likewise states, <i>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim</i> (Deut. 33:8). Now, Scripture tells us<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">I Sam. 30:7,8.</i> that God answered David through Abiathar’s ephod.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">In Ziklag. This ephod did not have the Urim and Thummim with it. The problem described above in note 61 now follows.</i> However, we also read that when Saul went to war he inquired of the Urim (I Sam. 28:6). These were the very Urim that were placed in the breastplate of judgment which was with the ephod<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">It was attached to the ephod.</i> and the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">It was worn by the priest who accompanied the ark.</i> However, David inquired of Abiathar’s ephod in Ziklag. Abiathar’s ephod was thus not Moses’ ephod.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Moses’ ephod was with Saul. We thus see that other ephods served to divine God’s will.</i> The following problem is even more difficult.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Than the above-raised question relating to a multiplicity of ephods and how they worked.</i> It is clear that the Urim do not refer to the stones of the breastplate,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">“Urim [means] they made their words enlightening [and Thummim] because they fulfill their words” (Soncino, <i>Yoma</i> 73b). Rashi explains that the stones on the breastplate of judgment served as the instrument of divination by lighting up. See Rashi on verse 30. Also see note 88. However, Rashi does not identify the stones on the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim. Other commentaries taking the Talmud at face value did. It is with these commentaries that I.E. takes issue.</i> as Scripture openly states, <i>And thou shalt set in it settings of stones</i> (v. 17). The setting of the stones was the work of a stonecutter and not the work of Moses. God then told Moses,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">After describing how the stones were to be arranged on the breastplate.</i> <i>And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim</i> (v. 30).<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">It is thus clear that the Urim and Thummim are not to be identified with the stones on the breastplate of judgment.</i> Scripture, in describing the making of the breastplate,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The printed texts have ephod. This is an obvious error. The word ephod does not appear in <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38. The latter reads: “Scripture in describing its making,” the reference being to the making of the previously mentioned breastplate.</i> tells us, <i>And they set in it four rows of stones</i> (Ex. 39:10). Scripture then describes the four rows of stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the stones are part of the breastplate and are not to be identified with the Urim and Thummim.</i> Scripture tells us that Moses placed the breastplate upon Aaron <i>and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim</i> (Lev. 8:8). Now according to the plain meaning of the text the stones were not the objects that enlightened or fulfilled,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the stones on the breastplate are not to be identified with the Urim and Thummim. See note 73.</i> because inquiries were made of the Urim and Thummim. We do not know what they were. The explanation that the names of the tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">As noted above, the Talmud explains that the letters on the stones lit up. It then says, “But the <i>tzadi</i> was not inscribed on any of the stones.” For none of the tribes has a <i>tzadi</i> in their names. The Talmud responds, “Rabbi Samuel ben Isaac says, ‘The names of Abraham, Isaac (Hebrew, <i>yod, <span class="underline">tzadi.</span> chet, kof</i>), and Jacob were also inscribed upon the stones’” (<i>Yoma</i> 73b).</i> and the patriarchs<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">See note 80. The Talmud says, “But the <i>tet</i> was not inscribed on the stones.” The words <i>shivte yeshurun</i> (the tribes of Jeshurun) were similarly inscribed on the stones” (<i>Yoma</i> 72b).</i> were inscribed on the breastplate is of no help,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">It does not help us to understand what the Urim and Thummim were.</i> for the breastplate of judgment was so called only because of the Urim that were on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">And as we have seen, the Urim cannot be identical with the stones which were upon the breastplate.</i> There is an additional question: we cannot identify the Urim with the Thummim,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, we do not know what the Thummim were.</i> for Scripture states, <i>with Urim and Thummim</i> (Neh. 7:65). Furthermore, the words <i>with Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i> are in the plural. They thus consisted of many objects.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">And we do not know what these objects were.</i> Rabbi Solomon says that the Urim and Thummim consisted of an inscription of God’s explicit name.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on verse 30: “The Urim and Thummim consisted of an inscription of God’s explicit name [upon some unknown material] which was placed inside the folds of the breastplate by means of which it [the breastplate] shed light upon its words and fulfilled its words.” That is, made its statements clear and its promises true.</i> However, he would not have said this had he seen the responsa of Rabbi Hai Gaon.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Hai Gaon, inscriptions of God’s explicit name cannot be used to divine the future. Nor do they assure success in any endeavor (Rabbi Samuel Zarza, <i>Mekor Chayyim</i>).</i> There is a very deep secret behind the ephod and the breastplate. I will allude only to a part of this secret. Perhaps he who knows the mind of the Most High will understand it. The following are the keys to the secret of the ephod.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the ephod was an astrological instrument which corresponded to the arrangement of the heavens. It drew power from above and, when properly used, had the ability to predict the future. Nahmanides sided with Rashi’s interpretation of the ephod and took strong issue with I.E. See Nahmanides on verse 30, “Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra thought to display wisdom in the matter of the Urim and the Thummim, by saying that they were made by a craftsman from gold and silver, and he continued his discussion of them in this vein, for he thought that they were akin to the forms which the astrologers make in order to know the thoughts of the one who comes to ask of them [about the future]. But what [Ibn Ezra] said is of no import. Rather, the Urim and Thummim are as Rashi has written: this was an inscription of the Proper Name of G-d which was placed between the folds of the breast-plate” (Chavel translation).</i> The two wreathen chains on the two rings [represent the head of Aries and Libra].<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">So Zarza. I.E. does not explain what the two wreathen chains on the two rings stand for. Sarim suggests that a line is missing. However, it is possible that I.E. believed that, from what follows, it is obvious what the two wreathen chains on the two rings stand for.</i> The band of the ephod represents the celestial equator.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The celestial equator extends from Aries to Libra. It divides the 12 constellations into two parts.</i> Hence six names were inscribed on the stone which was on the other shoulder.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">They represent the six constellations that lie on the other side of the equator. The point is that six names were written on the two stones of the ephod. Each group of names represented six constellations.</i> Now these things<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The division of the heavens into 12 distinct sections can only be grasped by the mind, for when one looks at the sky one does not see 12 distinct areas in the sky.</i> can only be grasped by the mind. Hence six names were inscribed on one stone<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">On one of the stones of the ephod.</i> in accordance with the number, names, and order of birth of the tribes of the children of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Each stone contained six names. There were no boundaries between them. The stone, as it were, took in all the names in the same way that the sky encompasses all the stars.</i> Six names were similarly inscribed on the second stone.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Of the ephod.</i> On the other hand, the names on the breastplate were not divided in the same manner as they are grasped by the mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">That is, six names were not written on one stone and six on another, with their boundaries left to the imagination. See notes 92 and 93.</i> They were divided in a way that could be perceived by the eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Each tribe’s name was inscribed on a separate stone.</i> Scripture states, <i>And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a thread of blue</i> (v. 28) to prevent the breastplate from moving to the side.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">To correspond to the stars that do not move out of their fixed orbits (Weiser).</i> The breastplate was folded, for the Urim and Thummim were kept there until such time as they were needed. They were then placed outside of the breastplate.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">They were removed from the folds of the breastplate.</i> Note, the stones of the ephod were like each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">They were of the same size.</i> They were of one color.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">They were both sapphires.</i> This was not the case with the stones of the breastplate,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Each stone corresponded to a different constellation.</i> for the sapphire stones<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Which were placed upon the ephod.</i> served as a memorial,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 12.</i> while the judgment of the children of Israel was upon the stones of the breastplate.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Judgment descended upon the children of Israel via each stone which represented a constellation.</i> The word Urim is related to the word <i>ur</i> (fire) in <i>I am warm, I have seen the fire</i> (Is. 44:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>ur</i> is a variation of <i>or</i> and should thus be translated as light. Hence, according to I.E., Is. 44:16 should be rendered: <i>I am warm, I have seen the light</i> (Krinsky). It should be noted that Nahmanides’ text of I.E. reads: “The Urim and Thummim were made out of gold.”</i> The Thummim are so called because they are whole.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>tummim</i> (thummim) is <i>taf, mem, mem</i>.</i> The Urim were of gold and silver.

They all had bands. However, they lacked the breastplate and the Urim. A priest who was an expert in using the Urim and Thummim was able to respond to an inquirer because the ephod at hand resembled [the ephod made by Moses].<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">It was a duplicate of the ephod made by Moses. Hence astrologically speaking it “worked.”</i> However, the priest did not always get an answer.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The priest received an answer only at a propitious time.</i> Now if I wanted to even begin to reveal this secret<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Of how the ephod worked.</i> it would take up more space than the entire commentary which I have composed on this book. For only an individual who has studied works on geometry and the secret of the way the sky works can understand the secret of the ephod. There is no need to expand on the form of the ephod, the breastplate, and the rings.

He similarly explains that <i>ve-yirkesu et ha-choshen…al chesehev ha-ephod</i> means that the <i>choshen</i> shall be twisted (that is, attached, for when one attaches something by a thread he twists it) upon the skillfully woven band of the ephod (Meijler). For other interpretations, see Krinsky.</i>

It should be noted that <i>Vat. Ebr</i>. 38 has a totally different reading. It reads: “The Gaon renders <i>tzitz</i> (plate) <i>atzabah</i>. It is placed on the mitre. The mitre does not have the shape of head-tires, for the head-tires are similar to the high hats which men in this and surrounding countries place upon their heads as a head covering.

I have already noted that the ornaments in the Land of Israel and the customs practiced there differ from those in these areas. Rabbi Solomon<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi.</i> found it necessary to harmonize Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi, verse 37 appears to contradict itself and Ex. 39:31. For verse 37 states, <i>And thou shalt put it</i> (the plate) <i>on a thread of blue</i>. However, it goes on to say, <i>and it</i> (the plate) <i>shall be upon the mitre</i>. This implies that the plate was on the mitre, not upon the thread. Furthermore, Ex. 39:31 states, <i>And they tied unto it</i> [the plate] a <i>thread of blue</i>. In other words, verse 37 implies that the plate was placed upon the thread, but Ex. 39:31 implies that the thread was placed on top of the plate.</i> by explaining that three blue threads were attached to the plate.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi explains that the plate was perforated at three points, viz., at the top and at the two ends of the plate. A thread was inserted through each of these perforations. Each thread was thus doubled when pulled through. Hence Rashi speaks of six threads. The threads were then tied together at the back of the neck. The thread in the center passed over the head and was bound with the ends of the two other threads. Rashi explains: “All the verses are now harmonized, <i>a thread upon the plate, and the plate upon the thread, and a thread upon the mitre on</i> top.” The first refers to the threads on the outer side of the plate, the second to the threads on the inner side of the plate, and the third to the threads that passed through the middle perforation.</i> However, according to the plain meaning of the text only one blue thread<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Attached to both extremities of the plate.</i> was necessary to keep the plate, which was on the face of the mitre on the forehead, in place.

I.E. literally reads: “Now you will never find.” This is a very laconic statement. Some would emend it to: Now we do not find [the mitre] to be worn [by all the priests]. In other words, the mitre is not to be identified with the head-tire.</i> For the mitre was set aside only for Aaron, and the head-tires for his children. Some say that the word <i>migba’ot</i> (head-tires) is related to the word <i>givot</i> (hills) (Gen. 49:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>migba’at</i> had the shape of a high hat.</i> The mitre<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>mitznefet</i>.</i> surrounded and wrapped the head.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is not to be identified with the <i>migba’at</i>.</i> We similarly read, <i>He will violently roll</i> (tzanof) <i>and toss thee Like a ball</i> (yitznofkha tzenefah) (Is. 22:18); <i>Yea, He will wind thee round and round</i> (ve-otekha ato) (Is. 22:17). The one who knows how the mitre is wrapped knows the meaning of [<i>The mitre shall be removed…</i>] <i>this shall be no more the same: that which is low shall be exalted, and that which is high abased</i> (Ezek. 21:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the meaning of the verse is: The mitre shall be removed…this shall no more be the same; the material making up the mitre shall no longer be wound from the bottom up or from the top down; i.e., the <i>miztnefet</i> shall no longer be wound about the head.</i> It takes a special skill to wind a mitre around the head. Now Scripture states, <i>And thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre</i> (Ex. 29:6). The <i>tzitz</i> (plate) (v. 36) is thus called a <i>nezer</i> (crown).<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Not to be confused with the word <i>keter</i> (crown), as the <i>keter</i> covers the entire head.</i> <i>But upon himself shall his crown</i> (nizro) <i>shine</i> (yatzitz) is similar (Ps. 132:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">In that the root of the word <i>tzitz</i> is used in connection with <i>nezer</i>.</i> Perhaps they all<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>tzitz</i> in our chapter and the word <i>yatzitz</i> in Ps. 132:18.</i> are used in the sense of <i>tzitz</i>, meaning something seen. The same is true with the word <i>metzitz</i> (peereth) in <i>He peereth through the lattice</i> (Cant. 2:9). Note that the five senses come together in the two cavities which are in that part of the brain which is behind the forehead. This is where the imaginative power is located. Furthermore, all thoughts begin there. It is for this reason that Scripture writes, regarding the plate, that Aaron shall bear the iniquity <i>committed in the holy things</i> (v. 38). It is possible that those who hallowed holy things unto the Lord did so while thinking improper thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the plate atones for improper thoughts.</i>

Verse 38



Verse 39

AND THOU SHALT WEAVE THE TUNIC IN CHEQUER WORK. When Scripture first mentions Aaron’s tunic it says, a <i>tunic of chequer work</i> (v. 4). Only Aaron’s tunic was chequered. His sons’ tunics were not. The tunic was chequered to dignify Aaron. Scripture similar reads, <i>And he put upon him the tunic</i> (Lev. 8:7) when it describes Aaron’s investiture. It reads, <i>the tunic</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha-ketonet</i>, with the definite article.</i> the reference being to the chequered tunic.

See I.E.’s short commentary, “During the days of <i>melu’im</i> the priest learned…to train his hands in the service.”</i> However, what will they do with <i>u-mile’u yadav</i> (so shall they consecrate it<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the altar.</i>) (Ezek. 43:26)?<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According to their interpretation we should render it, so shall they train the altar. This makes no sense.</i>

Verse 10

AND THOU SHALT BRING THE BULLOCK. This has already been mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 3. The question thus arises, “Why repeat it?”</i> Its meaning is as follows. When you shall bring the bullock,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-hikravta</i> (and thou shalt bring) is to be rendered, when thou shalt bring. Hence Scripture is not being redundant. See note 57.</i> Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon it.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This is not mentioned in verse 3.</i> Some say that the meaning of <i>and Aaron shall lay</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The text literally reads: and Aaron shall lay and his sons their hands on the head of the bullock. <i>Ve-samakh</i> (shall lay) is in the singular. Hence the interpretation quoted by I.E.</i> is: Aaron alone shall first lay his hands upon the head of the bullock. His sons shall then do the same. Now with regard to the ram, Scripture later states, <i>and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram</i> (v. 15). Scripture thus describes exactly what happened. They should lay their hands together, not one after the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">For the text reads, <i>ve-samekhu</i> (shall lay). <i>Ve-samekhu</i> is in the plural. The commentaries on I.E. differ over how to interpret this comment. Some take it to mean that I.E. indicates there was no difference in procedure between the laying of the hands upon the bullock and the laying of the hands upon the rams; in both cases Aaron and his sons put their hands upon the sacrificial animals in unison (Krinsky). Meijler is of the opinion that I.E. believes that in contrast to the laying of the hands upon the rams, Aaron first laid his hands upon the bullock and then his sons did the same. The difference of opinion revolves around how we interpret “Scripture thus describes exactly what happened.” Krinsky takes it to refer to both instances, while Meijler takes it to refer only to the second instance. For further elucidation, see Filwarg.</i>

Verse 11

AND THOU SHALT KILL THE BULLOCK. Moses slaughtered the bullock.
[BEFORE THE LORD.] Scripture reads, before the Lord,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Before the Lord seems to imply before the ark. However, the bullock was sacrificed before the altar which stood in the temple courtyard.</i> because the ark was in the center of the western side of the tabernacle. The incense altar was directly aligned with it. So was the altar of the burnt offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Which stood in the courtyard.</i>

Verse 12

HE SHALL POUR OUT.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yishpokh</i>. In our text of the Pentateuch the reading is: Thou shalt pour out (<i>tishpokh</i>). Meijler and Krinsky believe that I.E.’s version of the Pentateuch reads <i>yishpokh</i> (he shall pour out). However, Weiser believes that the reading of <i>yishpokh</i> is due to a copyist’s error. According to Weiser, I.E. also reads <i>tishpokh</i> (thou shalt pour out), and I.E. commented thereupon: <i>Yishpokh ha-kohen ha-shofekh</i> (The priest who pours shall pour out). In other words, I.E. explained, that <i>Thou shalt pour</i> is not to be taken literally, for Moses was not commanded to personally pour out the blood. He was told to appoint a priest to carry out this task. Some copyist then dropped the word <i>tishpokh</i> from the heading and made <i>yishpokh</i> into a heading. Hence our reading.</i> The priest who pours shall pour out.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">All the remaining blood at the base of the altar. See note 63.</i>

Verse 13

AND THOU SHALT TAKE. Bullock and goats do not have a fat tail (<i>alyah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">But rams do. See verse 22. Hence Scripture does not mention the fat tail here as it does when discussing the rams.</i>
[KIDNEYS.] Some say that <i>kelayot</i> (kidneys) are so called because the word <i>kelayot</i> is related to the word <i>kaletah</i> (pineth) in <i>My soul yearneth, yea even pineth for the courts of the Lord</i> (Ps. 84:3). For the power of sexual desire is located in the kidneys.

Verse 14

BUT THE FLESH OF THE BULLOCK. Flesh takes in the head and the pieces of the bullock.
AND ITS DUNG.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38.

For another interpretation, see note 69.</i> was to be washed and then it<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Krinsky explains that the meaning of <i>and its dung shalt thou burn</i> is: and the place where the dung collected thou shalt burn.</i> was to be burned.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Filwarg emends <i>u-firsho</i> (and its dung) to <i>u-lefi</i>. He interprets <i>But the flesh of the bullock</i> as follows: Flesh takes in the head and the pieces of the bullock. Now logically speaking, it was to be washed and then it was to be burned; i.e., the bullock was to be washed in the same manner that the ram (v. 17) was. See Weiser, Sarim, and Filwarg.</i>. AND HE SHALL MAKE THEM SMOKE (<i>ve-hiktir</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ve-hiktir</i> (and he shall make them smoke) does not appear in our verse. Weiser suggests that it has been transposed from verse 13. However, verse 13 reads <i>ve-hiktarta</i> (and make them smoke). Weiser explains that the original comment on verse 13 reads as follows: <i>Ve-hiktarta</i> (and [thou shalt] make them smoke). Commenting on this, I.E. writes: <i>Ve-hiktir</i> (and he shall make them smoke). That is, Moses himself was not commanded to personally place the organs on the fire; another priest would do as well. For some reason, a copyist left out the heading <i>ve-hiktarta</i> and the word <i>ve-hiktir</i> was transposed to verse 14. Meijler, on the other hand, claims that the word <i>ve-hiktir</i> should not be read as a heading but rather as the continuation of the previous sentence. The latter should read: Logically speaking, it was washed and then it was burned. After this, the priest smoked the enumerated organs.</i> The reference is to the enumerated organs.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The organs listed in verse 13.</i>
[SIN-OFFERING.] A sin offering is called a <i>chatat</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">A sin.</i> because it is brought to atone for a sin. The same applies to the <i>asham</i> (guilt-offering).<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, guilt. The sacrifice is referred to as “guilt” because it is brought to atone for one’s guilt.</i> Hence the meaning of <i>ve-chitte’u et ha-mizbe’ach</i> (they shall purify the altar)<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and they shall sin the altar.</i> is: they shall remove the sin from the altar.

Verse 15

THOU SHALT ALSO TAKE THE ONE RAM. Any one of the two rams which you decide to choose.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>ha-echad</i> (the one) is short for <i>ha-echad me-hashenayim</i> (one of the two). I.E. comments thus because <i>the one ram</i> seems to imply that Scripture has a specific ram in mind.</i>

Verse 16

AND THOU SHALT SLAY THE RAM, AND THOU SHALT TAKE ITS BLOOD AND DASH IT ROUND ABOUT AGAINST THE ALTAR. Not on the corners of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">As was done with the blood of the bullock. See verse 12.</i> Look, he [Moses] shall dash all the blood round about against the altar and not upon the base of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">As was done with the blood of the bullock. See verse 12.</i>

Verse 17

AND THE RAM. Scripture does not mention that Moses was commanded to cut the bullock into pieces. It was therefore entirely burned. Hence Scripture does not mention the bullock’s legs.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">As it does with regard to the ram.</i>
AND WASH.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, and thou shalt wash.</i> By command.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was to command someone to wash the ram. He did not personally have to do so, as implied by the literal meaning of the verse.</i>

Verse 18

AND THOU SHALT MAKE THE WHOLE RAM SMOKE. Hence the fat tail and the fat<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Which are mentioned with regard to the second ram. See verse 22.</i> are not mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">For they are included in the term <i>the whole ram</i>.</i>

Verse 19

AND THOU SHALT TAKE. This second ram served as the ram of consecration.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 31. Also see Lev. 8:22.</i>

Verse 20

THEN THOU SHALT KILL…TIP. The word <i>tenukh</i> (tip) has no counterpart.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>en lo re’a</i>. This usually indicates that the word appears nowhere else in Scripture. See I.E. on Num. 11:7. However, the word <i>tenukh</i> appears six times in the Book of Leviticus. Hence Krinsky interprets <i>en lo chaver</i> as meaning: it has no counterpart except with regard to the ear.</i> Saadiah Gaon says that it refers to the soft tissue which is connected to the circle of the ear.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The earlobe.</i>
THE GREAT TOE. The plural of <i>bohen</i> (great toe) is <i>behonot</i> (Jud. 1:6). This is grammatically inconsistent.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rules of Hebrew grammar the plural of <i>bohen</i> is <i>behanot</i>, not <i>behonot</i>. Compare, <i>goren, geranot</i>. The singular of <i>bahon</i> is <i>behonot</i> (Weiser).</i> This noun is thus vocalized according to two paradigms.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The singular and plural follow different paradigms.</i> There are many such nouns.
[AND DASH THE BLOOD.] The blood of the second ram shall be dashed<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Against the altar round about.</i> like the blood of the first ram.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 16.</i> The reference is only to the remaining blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The blood that remains after some blood has first been placed on the tip of the right ear, the right thumb, and the great toe of Aaron and his sons.</i>

Verse 21

AND THOU SHALT TAKE OF THE BLOOD THAT IS UPON THE ALTAR…AND SPRINKLE IT UPON AARON, AND UPON HIS GARMENTS. Beneath his garments<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">That is, upon Aaron’s body. The blood and the anointing oil were first sprinkled upon Aaron’s body and then, when Aaron dressed, upon his garments (Krinsky).</i> and upon his garments.

Verse 22

AND THOU SHALT TAKE OF THE RAM THE FAT. The reference is to the fat that is upon the innards, as stated in the Torah portion <i>Va-Yikra</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 3:3.</i>
THE RIGHT THIGH. The thigh that is on the right side<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>shok</i> (thigh) is feminine. Hence our verse should have read, <i>shok ha-yeminit</i>, rather than <i>shok ha-yamin</i> (the right side). Hence I.E. points out that <i>shok ha-yamin</i> is short for <i>shok tzad ha-yamin</i> (the thigh that is on the right side). <i>Tzad</i> is masculine. Hence the use of the masculine form <i>yamin</i>.</i> and the breast were taken from the ram of consecration. From that day on, the thigh and the breast of peace offerings were to be given to Aaron and his sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 7:34; 10:14,15.</i> However, Moses alone ate the breast of the ram of consecration because he was a high priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Moses served as high priest during the days of consecration.</i>

Verse 23

AND ONE LOAF OF BREAD. The reference is to the <i>unleavened bread</i> (v. 2).

Verse 24

AND SHALT WAVE THEM. While they<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The organs and bread listed in verse 22 and 23.</i> are in the hands of Aaron and his sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Moses placed his hand beneath the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved their hands along with their contents (Krinsky).</i>

Verse 25

AND THOU SHALT TAKE THEM FROM THEIR HANDS. Our verse states, <i>from their hands</i>. Elsewhere Scripture states, <i>from off their hands</i> (Lev. 8:28). They mean the same thing.
A SWEET SAVOUR. The <i>chet</i> is doubled in <i>nicho’ach</i> (sweet savour).<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <i>nicho’ach</i> is <i>nun, vav, chet</i>. There are two <i>chets</i> in <i>nicho’ach</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> [A SWEET SAVOUR BEFORE THE LORD.] The one who understands the secret of man’s soul<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Namely, that “A human being cannot speak of things above or below him without employing human terminology.” See I.E. on Gen. 1:26.</i> will understand this.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Why the Torah must employ anthropomorphic language (Weiser).</i>
AN OFFERING. The word <i>issheh</i> (offering) is an adjective. It is related to the word <i>esh</i> (fire). Scripture elsewhere states, <i>from the fire</i> (Num. 18:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Scripture uses the word <i>esh</i> in place of the word <i>issheh</i>. We thus see that they are related.</i>

Verse 26

AND THOU SHALT TAKE. From Aaron’s ram. Aaron’s sons are not mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the ram of sanctification was also theirs (Krinsky).</i> as Aaron was the principal.
[PORTION.] The word <i>manah</i> means a portion.

Verse 27

AND THOU SHALT SANCTIFY. From this day and henceforth.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">So too Rashi, “Sanctify them for all time.”</i> Waving and heaving are not identical.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse speaks of that which is waved (<i>hunaf</i>) and that which is heaved (<i>huram</i>). Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> For what is heaved is lifted up. It is not waved.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Heaving, literally lifting, refers to an up and down motion. Waving is a to and fro motion. See Rashi on verse 24.</i> The meaning of <i>even their heave-offering</i> (v. 28) is: the heave offerings which they will separate from peace offerings, shall be heaved in honor of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 28 reads, <i>for it is a heave-offering; and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of their sacrifices of peace-offerings, even their heave-offering unto the Lord</i>. The phrase <i>even their heave-offering unto the Lord</i> appears to be redundant. Hence I.E.’s comment that the verse is to be understood as follows: For it is a heave offering; and it shall be a heave offering from the children of Israel of their sacrifices of peace offerings. Now these heave offerings which they will separate from their peace offerings shall be heaved in honor of God. See Krinsky and Meijler.</i>

Verse 29

AND THE HOLY GARMENTS OF AARON SHALL BE FOR HIS SONS AFTER HIM. Shall be for his son who is anointed in his place.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>for his sons</i> means for those of his sons who are anointed in his place.</i>
[AFTER HIM.] After his death.

Verse 30

SEVEN DAYS. The word <i>yilbasham</i> (put them on) is vocalized with a long rather than a short <i>kamatz</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>tzerah</i>. According to the rules of grammar the word should read <i>yilbashem</i>. Compare, <i>yishlakhem</i>.</i> The word <i>amilam</i> (I will cut them off) in <i>Verily, in the name of the Lord I will cut them off</i> (Ps. 118:10) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">It too is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> in place of a <i>tzere</i>, as the word should have read <i>amilem</i>.</i>

Verse 33

AND THEY SHALL EAT THOSE THINGS. The verse is abridged.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">The subject is missing. According to I.E.’s short commentary on Exodus our verse literally reads: And they shall eat those things who atoned by them. The latter is short for: And the men who atoned by them shall eat those things.</i>
[THEM.] The word <i>otam</i> (them) also refers to something else.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>otam</i> (them) in <i>le-kadesh otam</i> (to sanctify them) also applies to <i>ve-zar lo yokhkal</i> (but a stranger shall not eat). The latter is to be read as if written <i>ve-zar lo yokhkal otam</i> (but a stranger shall not eat them).</i>
BUT A STRANGER. Who is not of Aaron’s seed.

Verse 34

AND IF AUGHT. The ram of consecration is so called because they are consecrated by it.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, their hands become full by it. For the meaning of this expression, see I.E. on verse 9.</i>

Verse 35

THEE. The word <i>otakhah</i> has an <i>etnach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">A note indicating a pause.</i> beneath it.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the <i>tav</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> rather than with a <i>sheva</i>, i.e., <i>otakhah</i> rather than <i>otekha</i>.</i> <i>Otakhah</i> is a combination of <i>otakh</i> (thee) (Gen. 39:9), which is vocalized with a long <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>tav</i>, and <i>otekha</i> (thee)<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Which is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>kaf</i>.</i> in <i>for thee have I seen</i> (Gen. 7:1).

Verse 36

AND EVERY DAY SHALT THOU OFFER THE BULLOCK. Every day of the seven days of consecration.
[BESIDE THE OTHER OFFERINGS OF ATONEMENT.] Its meaning is, in addition to the two rams.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Which were offered for atonement. See Nahmanides.</i> Scripture further states, <i>As hath been done this day, so the Lord hath commanded to do</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">For seven days. See I.E. on Lev. 8:34.</i> <i>to make atonement for you</i> (Lev. 8:34).

Verse 37

MOST HOLY. The meaning of <i>kodesh kodashim</i> (most holy) is holy like any other holy object.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">The repetition of the word <i>kodesh</i> does not indicate superholiness as most commentators assume. See I.E. on Gen. 9:25.</i>
WHATSOEVER TOUCHES THE ALTAR SHALL BE HOLY. This is similar to <i>Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy</i> (Lev. 6:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which according to I.E. is: <i>Whatsoever shall touch the flesh</i> of the sin offering <i>shall be holy</i> to God; that is, only a priest may eat of it (I.E. on Lev. 6:20). Similarly, Scripture here teaches that any flesh that touches the altar shall be holy to God and only a priest may eat of it.</i> Some say that the verse speaks only of the bread. Scripture is telling us that if the bread is not holy, that is, if the bread is unclean, then it shall not touch the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our verse may be paraphrased as: the bread that touches the altar must be in a state of purity.

Verse 38

NOW THIS IS. Its meaning is: now this is the sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">So Meijler. In other words, <i>ve-zeh</i> (now this is) is short for <i>ve-zeh ha-korban</i> (now this is the sacrifice).</i> Similarly, the meaning of <i>This they shall give</i> (Ex. 30:13) is: this amount they shall give.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote"><i>This</i> is short for this amount.</i> Similarly <i>And this is that thou shalt make it</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Gen. 6:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is: and this is the size that thou shalt make it.</i> Moses shall do this<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Offer two lambs daily on the altar.</i> during the seven days of consecration.

Verse 39

THE ONE LAMB. The <i>heh</i> prefixed to the word <i>keves</i> (lamb) also serves as a prefix to the word <i>echad</i> (one).<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha-keves echad</i> is ungrammatical. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The phrase is to be read as if written, <i>et ha-keves ha-echad</i> (the one lamb).<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">This is precisely the reading of our texts. However, the parallel reading in Num. 28:4 is <i>ha-keves echad</i>. There too I.E. comments that the <i>heh</i> prefixed to the word <i>keves</i> also serves as a prefix to the word <i>echad</i> and that the phrase is to be read as if written <i>ha-keves ha-echad</i>. I.E. might have been commenting from memory and confused the two sections. However, Shadal, Meijler, and Filwarg believe that I.E. had a version of the Pentateuch in which Ex. 29:39 read: <i>et ha-keves echad</i>.</i> Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that the meaning of <i>et ha-keves echad</i> is, the lamb, one lamb.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>keves</i> is to be read as if written twice, that is, <i>et ha-keves, keves echad</i>.

Verse 40

A TENTH PART. A tenth part of an <i>ephah</i>.
[A HIN.] Also note that <i>hin</i> is an Egyptian measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. similarly believed that the name Moses and the word <i>chartumim</i> are Egyptian words. See I.E. on Ex. 2:10 and 7:11.</i>

Verse 41

AND. The word <i>u-kheniskah</i> (and according to the drink offering thereof)<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>U-kheniskah</i> is in the feminine.

So Weiser. Filwarg believes that I.E. is of the opinion that <i>boker</i> here is feminine. Hence <i>u-kheniskah</i> refers to it rather than to <i>keves</i>.</i>

Verse 42

IT SHALL BE A CONTINUAL BURNT-OFFERING THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS. They shall bring these offerings when they enter the land of Canaan. For the Israelites offered burnt offerings only for fifty days in the desert of Sinai. This is what Scripture means by <i>It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in mount Sinai</i> (Num. 28:6). The tabernacle was placed at the edge of the camp at the bottom of the mount,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">When it was first erected on the first day of Nisan (Ex. 40:17). Israel journeyed from Sinai on the 20th day of the second month (Num. 10:11,12). The tabernacle was thus at Sinai for 50 days. It was during these 50 days that Israel offered burnt offerings.</i> as the tribes were intermingled.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites formed an amorphous mass.

Be that as it may, I.E.’s point is that after 50 days at Sinai, the ark was no longer in the tabernacle and thus no sacrifices were offered. See Filwarg.</i> Logically speaking, the Israelites offered burnt offerings and sacrifices only at Sinai and on Yom Kippur in the second year. This is what Scripture states regarding Aaron’s service.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">That is, regarding the service which Aaron was to perform on Yom Kippur.</i> The Torah there writes, <i>And he</i> [Aaron] <i>did as the Lord commanded Moses</i> (Lev. 16:34).<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Aaron performed the Yom Kippur service.</i> Scripture similarly states, <i>Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</i> (Amos 5:25). Israel spent about thirty-eight years in a wasteland, in <i>a howling wilderness</i> (Deut. 32:10). Where did they get half a <i>hin</i> of olive oil and a half <i>hin</i> of wine daily?<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Necessary for the daily sacrifice. See verses 40 and 41.</i> How could they carry almost fourteen thousand <i>hin</i> around with them?<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The total amount of olive oil necessary for the daily burnt offering during their sojourn in the desert of Sinai.</i> Where did they get two lambs daily in the first year? Where did they get the animals for the additional sacrifices on the Sabbath and the festivals? The statement <i>we and our cattle</i> (Num. 20:4)<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Which shows that the Israelites had cattle.</i> does not refute our contention, for Israel was then at Kadesh,<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 20:1.</i> and they bought cattle from the settled population. Furthermore, they looted the Midianites and the lands of Sihon and Og in that year. They thus had an abundance of cattle.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">At that time, but not before.</i>
[I WILL MEET.]<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ivva’ed</i>.</i> Scripture clearly explains the reason that the tabernacle is called the <i>ohel mo’ed</i> (the tent of meeting).<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ivva’ed</i> and <i>mo’ed</i> come from the same root.</i>
WITH YOU. Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lakhem</i> (with you) is a plural. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> We find this to be the case when the congregation was called together.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">God met with the congregation when Moses called them together by sounding trumpets. See Num. 10:3, <i>And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting</i>. So Meijler and Filwarg. According to Weiser its meaning is: Scripture uses the word <i>ve-no’adu</i> (shall gather themselves), which comes from the same root as <i>mo’ed</i> when it describes the gathering of the congregation. We thus see that the term <i>mo’ed</i> means gathering or meeting.</i>
TO SPEAK THERE UNTO THEE. To speak there alone to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elekha</i> (unto thee) is in the singular. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> However, Yefet says that the meaning of <i>I will meet with you</i> is: with Moses and occasionally with Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the use of the plural <i>lakhem</i> (with you).</i> He maintains that <i>to speak there unto thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Hence <i>elekha</i> (unto thee) is in the singular.</i> hints that God will continually speak there with Moses. He offers, <i>And there I will meet with the children of Israel</i> (v. 43) as proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">If <i>lakhem</i> refers to Israel, why would Scripture repeat itself in verse 43?</i>

Verse 43

AND [THE TENT] SHALL BE SANCTIFIED BY MY GLORY. I believe that the tent of meeting was the place of meeting because it took in everything, namely, the tabernacle and all its utensils, the ark, and the three objects.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">The table of showbread, the menorah, and the incense altar.</i> The tent will be sanctified by My glory, which will rest on the cherubim.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., verse 43 should be paraphrased as follows: I will meet with the children of Israel in the tent of meeeting because the tent of meeting takes in the tabernacle and all of its utensils, the ark, the table of showbread, the menorah, and the incense altar. The tent of meeting shall be sanctified by My glory, which will rest on the cherubim. It should be noted that I.E.’s comment is difficult to unravel, and the various commentaries offer differing interpretations and emendations. However, the above seems to be the correct interpretation.</i>

Verse 44

AND I WILL SANCTIFY THE TENT OF MEETING. It is because of the glory that the tent is holy, for it was sanctified by the glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in verse 33.</i> The altar that stood<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">In the temple courtyard.</i> before the opening of the tent of meeting was similarly sanctified.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">By God’s glory.</i>
AARON ALSO AND HIS SONS WILL I SANCTIFY. I will sanctify Aaron and his sons, who minister in the tent of meeting and upon the altar.

Verse 45

AND I WILL DWELL. Scripture describes how God’s glory will dwell among the children of Israel when the standards will be set up.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our verse adverts to the time when the camp of Israel will be set up in the form of a square with the tent of meeting in its center. Hence our verse speaks of God dwelling among the children of Israel. See Num. 2-4.</i> Four standards were set up on the four sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 2-4.</i> Additionally, there was a separation between the camp of the Levites and the camp of the Israelites<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumed this, as Scripture does not explicitly so state. See I.E. on Deut. 23:10. According to Meijler, I.E. considers the space between the camp of the Levites and that of the Israelites as a barrier.</i> because they too camped on all four sides,<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">The tribe of Levi camped around the four sides of the tent of meeting.</i> There was another barrier beyond this barrier where the tent of meeting was placed amidst the children of Israel. Now a person who experienced a seminal emission did not have to leave the camp of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">For there was a separation between the camp of Israel and the tent of meeting. See Deut. 23:11.</i> Neither was there a place set aside beyond the border of the camp for a person to sit down [and relieve himself].<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 13 and 14.</i> The commandment for a person who experienced a seminal emission to leave the camp<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 23:11.</i> applied only to the camp of Israel when it went to war against the enemy.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 23:10.</i> The commandment <i>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies</i> (Deut. 23:10) similarly does not speak of the entire camp of Israel, men, women, and children. It is only males, and then only a small number of them, who sally out to wage war. Now when the soldiers of Israel carried the ark with them as Phineas did,<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 31:6 along with I.E.’s comment.</i> they were unable to set up a barrier between themselves and the place of the ark.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Hence all who experienced emissions and all those who had to relieve themselves had to leave the camp.</i>

Verse 46

AND THEY SHALL KNOW. Its meaning is, then they shall know that the only reason that I took them out of Egypt was so that they would make a sanctuary for Me that I may dwell among them. This is what Scripture means by <i>ye shall serve God upon this mountain</i> (Ex. 3:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">The verse refers to the tabernacle which Israel would build at the foot of Mount Sinai.</i>

Chapter 30



Verse 1

AND THOU SHALT MAKE AN ALTAR TO BURN INCENSE UPON. The word <i>miktar</i> (to burn) is an infinitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In the form of a noun. See Weiser.

Verse 2

A CUBIT. The altar was a half a cubit higher than the table.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Of showbread. The table was a cubit and a half high.</i> Perhaps it was similarly half a cubit higher than the menorah.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the menorah, like the table, was a cubit and a half high. The Torah does not give the height of the menorah. I.E. believes that it is possible that the menorah was the height of the table for aesthetic purposes.</i> The altar<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Which stood in the sanctuary.</i> was aligned with the cherubim<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Which stood in the Holy of Holies.</i> which spread their wings upward.

Verse 3

AND THOU SHALT OVERLAY IT WITH PURE GOLD. A top is mentioned with regard to the altar of incense. Scripture does not mention a top with regard to the brass altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The altar of burnt offerings, which stood in the courtyard. This altar did not have a top. It was hollow and filled in with earth (Rashi).</i> The altar<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Of incense.</i> was called the golden altar<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 3:38; Num. 4:11.</i> because it was overlaid with gold. The same applies to <i>The pure table</i> (Lev. 24:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It was made of acacia wood but is referred to as the pure (gold) table because it was overlaid with gold.

See I.E. on Ex. 25:31. Similarly <i>the pure table</i> means the table made of pure gold.</i>

Verse 4

UPON THE TWO SIDES OF IT. Scripture states this<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Upon the two sides of it</i> following <i>upon the two sides thereof</i>.</i> in order to be especially clear.
[WHEREWITH.] THE <i>heh</i> at the end of the word <i>ba-hemmah</i> (wherewith) is superfluous,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ba-hemmah</i> is a variant of <i>ba-hem</i>.</i> as I have already noted,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 1:1 and the notes thereto.</i> since <i>hemmah</i> is penultimately accented.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">If the <i>heh</i> were an integral part of the word the word would be ultimately accented.

BEFORE THE ARK-COVER. The altar should be aligned with the ark cover.

Verse 7

AND AARON SHALL BURN THEREON INCENSE OF SWEET SPICES. Along with other spices (<i>besamim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, “And Aaron shall burn upon them <i>ketoret sammim</i> (incense of sweet spices).” I.E. explains that the incense consisted of <i>sammim</i> (sweet spices) plus <i>besamim</i> (spices). I.E.’s comment is based on Ex. 25:6, which reads, <i>spices</i> (besammim) <i>for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense</i> (ketoret sammim). See I.E. on the latter.</i> It is possible that the <i>sammim</i> (sweet spices) were the most important ingredient.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the word <i>besamim</i> is not mentioned in its name and the incense is called <i>ketoret sammim</i>.</i> It is also possible that Scripture mentions <i>sammim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the incense of sweet spices (<i>ketoret sammim</i>).</i> (spices) in order to distinguish between the compounds,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The anointing oil and the incense of sweet spices.</i> as one of the compounds<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The anointing oil.</i> consisted only of <i>besamim</i> (spices).

[WHEN HE DRESSETH.] When he fixes the wick and the oil.

Verse 8

LIGHTETH THE LAMPS. Scripture employs <i>be-he’alot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">From the root <i>ayin, lamed, heh</i>, which means to go up.</i> for lighting because the flame of the wick goes up. <i>Be-he’alot</i> is clearly a transitive verb.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning to cause a flame to go up.</i>
A PERPETUAL INCENSE. When they offer burnt offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The law concerning the bringing of incense is contingent on the bringing of offerings.

Verse 9

YE SHALL OFFER NO STRANGE INCENSE. An incense which is not its exact duplicate.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">An incense which is not made exactly in accordance with the prescription that Scripture lays down for the incense. See verse 34.</i>

May the name of the exalted God be eternally blessed. He did every good for Israel.

[WHEN THOU TAKEST THE SUM.] Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Now.</i> begins to explain the law of the atonement money which each and every one is obligated to give. The atonement money was not a free will offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Everything described up to now was made from donations. See Ex. 25:2.</i> Scripture makes mention of the atonement money here because it notes above<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10.</i> that atonement shall be made [upon the horns of the altar of incense] once a year. The atonement money was, as I will explain, similarly to be given once a year. The description of the laver and its base follow next<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 17-21.</i> because they are not to be made from free will gifts of the congregation but only from the mirrors of the women who performed tasks.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 38:8.

Scripture next<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 32:11-14.</i> records the prayer offered by Moses before he came down from the mountain. However, it first had to mention the making of the golden calf<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 32:1-10.</i> so that we would know why Moses prayed. Scripture then tells of Moses’ descent from the mountain,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 32:14.</i> the burning of the calf,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 32:20.</i> and Moses’ return to the mountain to pray for Israel a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 32:31,32.</i> Scripture mentions that Moses’ anger caused him to move his tent outside the camp of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 33:7. The first part of the clause is an assumption. See next note.</i> However, some say that Scripture records what happened.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses removed his tent from Israel. In other words, Scripture did not intend to imply that Moses was angry at Israel and therefore removed his tent from their midst. It merely records what happened.</i> Scripture then mentions Moses’ great glory, namely, that Moses saw God’s glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 33:23. What I.E. must mean by “that Moses saw God’s glory” is that God promised Moses that he would show him His glory. Moses actually saw God’s glory after he hewed out the second pair of tablets. See Chapter 34.</i> It tells us that God then commanded Moses to descend and hew out tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">A second set of tablets. See Ex. 34:1.</i> It informs us that God inscribed the tablets a second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 34:1,28.</i> Scripture mentions<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 34:11-26.</i> the conditions upon which God made a treaty with Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 34:27.</i> These conditions are recorded in the Torah portion <i>Ve-Ellaeh Ha-Mishpatim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">These conditions are the same ones that are first mentioned in Ex. 23:12-33.

It was obligatory whether their king counted them or not.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it was obligatory whether or not the people were counted.</i> Saadiah Gaon offers the census taken by Moses in the desert as proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">II Chron. 24:6 refers to the money collected to repair the temple as <i>the tax of Moses</i>. According to Saadiah the reference is to the annual tax instituted by Moses in the desert. Hence the paraphrase “the tax of Moses in the desert.”</i> Saadiah says that the money collected was used for the congregational sacrifices, the construction of the laver, the making of the anointing oil, and the sweet incense. Part of it was also given to the Sanhedrin.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">In later times.</i> Bezalel and Oholiab allude to this.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 31:1-11 tells us that Bezalel and Oholiab were given the charge of constructing the tabernacle. Scripture tells of this here because part of the atonement money was given to them. Bezalel and Oholiab were the equivalent of the Sanhedrin because they were in charge of constructing the tabernacle.</i> [WHEN THOU TAKEST THE SUM.]<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ki Tissa</i> literally means when you lift up.</i> It is customary for the accountants who are intimate with the details of an account to itemize upon pages. However they write the sum of all the items<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Of any particular page.</i> at the head of the page.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture speaks of raising up the sum, for the sum is raised to the top of the page. See I.E. on Gen. 41:13 and the notes thereto.</i> Some say that the plague which occurred in the days of David<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">II Sam. 24.</i> struck because Israel did not offer a ransom for their soul. If this is true it refutes the opinion of Saadiah Gaon.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">According to Saadiah there was an annual obligation to give half a shekel as a ransom for one’s soul. Now if this is an annual obligation it is highly unlikely that David forgot to collect it when he counted the people (Weiser).</i>
[WHEN THOU NUMBEREST THEM.] The meaning of <i>that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them</i> is: if they do not give atonement money at the very moment of the numbering, a plague will strike. However, Yefet says it means that if they are numbered and do not give their ransom, they will fall before their enemies when they go to war.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, that <i>there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them</i> refers to defeat by their enemies.</i>

Verse 13

THIS. This amount. It is similar to <i>And this thou shalt make it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (Gen. 7:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, and this size thou shalt make it. In other words, here too “this” is an abridged form.</i>
[EVERY ONE THAT PASSETH.] The meaning of <i>every one that passeth</i> is everyone who passes his twentieth year. Twenty years is about three weeks of years [almost twenty-one years].<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the number seven has a special significance.

[GERAHS.] These <i>gerahs</i><sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the word <i>gerah</i> is related to the word <i>gargir</i> [berry or pit].</i> refer to the pits of a carob.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>gerah</i> weighed the same as a pit of a carob.</i>

Verse 14

EVERY ONE…THAT ARE NUMBERED. <i>Pekudim</i> (that are numbered) is active.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pekudim</i> is a passive form. However, it is to be interpreted as an active. <i>Pekudim</i> is to be rendered, that number. Rashi on verse 13 similarly comments: “Those who count.” <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 and other editions of I.E. read, “<i>Pekudim</i> is passive.” In other words, contra Rashi, <i>pekudim</i> is to be rendered, that are numbered.</i>

Verse 15

THE RICH. Scripture explains why the rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less. The reason for this is that the money is an atonement for one’s soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">All souls are equally precious. See Krinsky.</i>

Verse 16

AND THOU SHALT TAKE…AND SHALT APPOINT IT FOR THE SERVICE OF THE TENT OF MEETING. This is explained in the Torah portion <i>Ve-Ellah Pekude</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 38:25-28 tells us what the atonement money was used for, namely, to make sockets and hooks.</i>
[THAT IT MAY BE A MEMORIAL FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] For the tabernacle stood only upon sockets which were made from the atonement money<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 38:27.</i> as a memorial for the children of Israel.

Verse 17

AND THE LORD SPOKE. A new section begins here.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Hence verse 17 opens with <i>And the Lord spoke</i> (Meijler). It is possible that I.E. had before him manuscripts of the Pentateuch in which verse 17 did not start a new section. Hence I.E. pointed out that it opens a new section (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 18

AND THE BASE THEREOF. <i>Kanno</i> means the base thereof.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>mekhonoto</i>.</i> The bases that Solomon made<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">For the lavers.</i> proves this.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">II Chron. 4:14 reads, <i>and the lavers made he</i> [Solomon] <i>upon the bases</i> (mekhonot). We thus see that <i>kanno</i> means <i>mekhonoto</i>; i.e., <i>kanno</i> means its base.</i> Now Scripture states that the laver was placed <i>between the tent of meeting and the altar</i>. This shows that the altar was not adjacent to the door of the tent but was close to it The altar was placed in the center<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Of the courtyard, which faced the front of the tabernacle.</i> and was aligned with the altar of incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Which was aligned with the door of the tabernacle.</i> The laver was placed between the tent and the altar, towards one of the sides.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">It was not centered between the altar and the opening of the tabernacle. Rashi, quoting <i>Zebachim</i> 59b, similarly writes: “The laver was removed a little toward the south.”</i> However, Scripture does not mention this.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not mention the place of the laver (Weiser). Or, Scripture does not mention that the laver was off center (Meijler). According to Filwarg and Krinsky, I.E. discusses the altar mentioned in our verse. Scripture states, <i>and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar</i>. However, it does not identify which altar it is referring to. I.E. points out that the reference is to the altar of the burnt offering, for it is illogical to assume that the laver was placed in the sanctuary between the tent of meeting and the altar of incense.</i> It does not seem logical for the laver to be aligned with the altar of incense<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">This would be the case if the laver was placed directly between the altar and the opening of the tent of meeting.</i> and thus be aligned with the ark cover.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">For it is unseemly to wash oneself before the ark.</i>

Verse 19

SHALL WASH. Scripture mentions that the laver was necessary because of those who served in the tabernacle, namely, Aaron and his sons and their descendants. Moses is not now mentioned, as Moses alone used the laver as long as he lived.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">His descendants who were not priests, did not use the laver.</i> However, Scripture mentions Moses’ use of the laver when it describes the actual setting up of the laver.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 40:31.</i>

Verse 20

WHEN THEY GO INTO THE TENT OF MEETING, THEY SHALL WASH WITH WATER. The meaning of <i>yirchatzu mayim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, they shall wash water.

In other words, <i>yirchatzu mayim</i> means <i>yirchatzu rechitzat mayim</i>, for the noun <i>rechitzat</i> is implied in the verb <i>yirchatzu</i> (Filwarg). In his short commentary I.E. notes that <i>yirchatzu mayim</i> is short for <i>yirchatzu ba-mayim</i>.

TAKE THOU ALSO UNTO THEE. <i>Kach lekha</i> (take unto thee) is similar to <i>lekh leha</i> (get thee out) (Gen. 12:1) and <i>u-kechu lakhem tzon</i> (and take you lambs) (Ex. 12:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">In that the word <i>lekha</i> (plural, <i>lakhem</i>) follows the word for emphasis.</i> According to the plain meaning of the text, <i>aseh lekha saraf</i> (make thee a fiery serpent) (Num. 21:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rabbis the word <i>lekha</i> indicates that Moses had to bear the expense of making the fiery serpent. <i>Lekha</i> should be interpreted as <i>mishelkah</i> (from what is yours).

Myrrh is thus gathered.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Cant. 5:1 indicates that musk is gathered.

The same also applies to the calamus.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads, <i>u-keneh bosem</i> (and sweet calamus). The same question that was raised regarding <i>ve-kinnemon besem</i> can be raised here; i.e., having stated <i>keneh</i>, why add <i>bosem</i>?</i> [HALF SO MUCH, EVEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY.] The ancients, of blessed memory, said that all the ingredients were of equal weight.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Each type of spice used in the anointing oil weighed 500 <i>shekalim</i>.

See <i>Keritot</i> 5a. Krinsky tries to limit I.E.’s remarks to the cinnamon. However, he admits that he is pressing the point, for I.E. reads “all,” and the meaning of “all” is all the ingredients.</i> We will accept what they say. However, we do not know why Scripture says, <i>half so much even two hundred and fifty</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">If 500 <i>shekalim</i> of sweet cinnamon was used.</i> I do not understand the reason for the halves<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">That is, why the cinnamon was brought in two halves, each consisting of 250 <i>shekalim</i>. According to the rabbis, the reason for bringing the cinnamon in two halves was to gain the overweights. We thus read, “Said Rabbi Judah: Why are the five hundred shekels of sweet cinnamon taken in two portions of two hundred and fifty each? Since the total quantity is five hundred, why not bring the whole at a time? From the fact that the cinnamon is brought in two portions we may infer that there was an overweight each time (that is, the division was for the purpose of adding a greater overweight of cinnamon)” (<i>Keritot</i> 5a, Soncino translation).</i> for it is the practice in all of the lands of the Ishmaelites not to add even the weight of a mustard seed to anything being weighed. They most certainly do not add anything to any ingredient used in the work of a perfumer.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumes that what was common practice in his day was also common practice in Rabbinic times.</i>

For Scripture states, <i>but thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil</i> (Deut. 28:40). It is prohibited for a priest and certainly for anyone else to anoint themselves with this oil, for the anointing oil was poured upon the head of the anointed.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">A high priest or a king.</i>

WHOSOEVER. The meaning of <i>or whosoever putteth any of it on a stranger</i> (zar) is: or whosoever putteth any of it on someone who is not of Aaron’s family.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>zar</i> refers to someone not of Aaron’s family.</i> Saadiah Gaon, of blessed memory, says that Israel had a tradition that David and his seed should be anointed with the anointing oil. Other kings were not to be so anointed. The Gaon was compelled to explain thus because Zadok<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">The high priest.</i> took some of the anointing oil that was in the tent of meeting and used it to anoint Solomon.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">See I Kings 1:39. Solomon was not a descendant of Aaron. Thus anointing him apparently violated the dictates of our verse. Hence Saadiah’s interpretation.</i> Yefet says that <i>on a stranger</i> means on someone who is not an Israelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it was possible to anoint Solomon with the anointing oil.</i> However, he was mistaken, for Scripture states, <i>and the stranger</i><sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> (zar) <i>that draweth nigh shall be put to death</i> (Num. 3:10). The meaning of the latter is: <i>To the end that no stranger</i> (zar), <i>that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw near</i> (Num. 17:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see, contra Yefet, that <i>zar</i> refers to anyone not of Aaron’s family.

So too Rashi.</i> that this law<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Whosoever putteth any of it on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people</i>.</i> refers only to the oil made by Moses. However, this also does not appear to me to be correct. For Scripture first states, <i>This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations</i> (v. 31).<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which according to I.E. is, oil later made according to this composition. See I.E. on verse 31.</i> Furthermore, the Pentateuch states (v. 33), <i>Whosoever, compoundeth any like it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Like it</i> indicates that Scripture speaks of a duplicate, and not the original anointing oil made by Moses.</i> <i>or whosoever putteth any of</i> “a similarly compounded oil”<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">“A similarly compounded oil” is I.E.’s paraphrase of “it.”</i> <i>upon a stranger</i>. Thus there is no difference between the anointing oil made by Moses and its duplicate which was made later. Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. now takes issue with Saadiah, who claims that <i>whosoever putteth any of it on a stranger</i> does not apply to the Davidic dynasty.</i> does not state, “except for the family of David.”<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture does not state <i>whosoever putteth any of it on a stranger</i> with the exception of the house of David <i>shall be cut off from his people</i>.</i> I believe that all the commandments are obligatory on all the generations of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the law prohibiting a stranger to use the anointing oil applied to the house of David.</i> The law stating that no burnt offering should be offered in any but the chosen place<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 12:13,14.</i> is an example.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Of a law which is eternally binding.

According to I.E. a prophet may temporarily suspend a law.</i> We can say the same also with regard to Solomon.

Verse 1

AND THE LORD SPOKE. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon asked, “Why were Bezalel and Oholiab chosen?”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To construct the tabernacle.</i> He answered that Bezalel was chosen because he was descended from Judah, whom Jacob compared to a lion’s whelp (Gen. 49:9). Oholiab was chosen because he was descended from Dan, whom Moses also compared to a lion’s whelp (Deut. 33:22). The lion is narrow at the end. The temple was similarly narrow at the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mishnah Middot</i> 4:7, “The sanctuary was narrow behind and wide in front, and it was like a lion, as it is written, <i>Ah, Ariel</i> (literally, lion of God), <i>Ariel, the city where David encamped</i> (Is. 29:1); as a lion is narrow behind and wide in front so the sanctuary was narrow behind and wide in front” (Danby translation).</i> Now this is a preacher’s homily,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah Gaon’s interpretation is not in keeping with the plain meaning of the text.</i> for Bezalel and Oholiab did not build the temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which was wide in front and narrow in the back. They built the tabernacle, which was rectangular.</i> The width of the tabernacle which they made did not vary.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The tabernacle was not shaped like a lion; that is, it was not “narrow behind and wide in front.” There is thus no basis for Saadiah’s assertion that Bezalel and Oholiab were chosen to build the tabernacle because they were descended from people who were described as “lion’s whelps.”</i> There is no basis for Saadiah Gaon’s question.

[I HAVE CALLED BY NAME BEZALEL.] Bezalel is the one being called.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>karati</i> (I have called) is to be connected to <i>bezalel ben uri</i> (Bezalel the son of Uri) rather than to the word <i>be-shem</i> (by name). Thus <i>karati be-shem bezalel ben uri</i> (I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri) is to be rendered: I have called Bezalel the son of Uri by name. I.E. comments thus because <i>karati be-shem bezalel ben uri</i> could conceivably be translated: I have called upon the name of Bezalel the son of Uri. Compare, <i>va-yikra be-shem Adonai</i> (and called upon the name of the Lord) (Gen. 12:8).</i> The meaning of <i>I have called by name Bezalel</i> is: I have called Bezalel’s name because he has no equal in ability to construct the tabernacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture continues, <i>and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom…to devise skilful works, to work in gold</i>, etc.</i>
[BEZALEL THE SON OF URI, THE SON OF HUR.] According to the plain meaning of the text, Caleb the son of Jephunneh<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 13:6.</i> is not to be identified with Caleb the son of Hezron.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Caleb the son of Hezron was the father of Hur. Hur was the father of Uri. Uri was the father of Bezalel (I Chron. 2:19,20). The Talmud (<i>San.</i> 69b) identifies Caleb the son of Hezron with Caleb the son of Jephunneh. I.E. disagrees. For a full discussion, see Vol. 1, p. 355, note 20.</i> There is indisputable evidence that this is so.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Caleb the son of Jephunneh was 39 years of age at the time that Bezalel constructed the tabernacle. For Caleb said, <i>Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land</i> (Josh. 14:7). Now the tabernacle was constructed in the first year of the Exodus, and the spies were sent in the second year of the Exodus. Caleb was thus 39 years of age when Bezalel constructed the tabernacle. I.E. reasons that it is highly unlikely for a 39-year-old man to be a great-grandfather. In fact, the only way the sages of the Talmud could explain the aforementioned was to maintain that the early generations had children at the age of eight. See <i>San.</i> 69b and Vol. 1, p. 355, note 20.</i> Intelligent people will understand the proof.

Verse 3

AND I HAVE FILLED HIM. This is similar to <i>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom</i> (Deut. 34:9). [AND I HAVE FILLED HIM WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD, IN WISDOM, AND IN UNDERSTANDING.] Scripture states, <i>And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him</i> (Is. 11:2). It then goes on to explain that the spirit of the Lord is <i>The spirit of wisdom and understanding</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.). Wisdom (<i>chokhmah</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. divides intelligence into three parts: <i>chokhmah</i> (wisdom), <i>binah</i> (understanding), and <i>da’at</i> (knowledge). The kabbalists gave similar names to the first three <i>sefirot</i> (emanations). The term Chabad, which is the name of a well-known hassidic movement, is an acronym of these three terms.</i> refers to the type of intelligence that is stored in the back of the brain.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, wisdom is the form stored in the back of the brain of the head. I.E. divides the brain into three parts. Having similarly divided intelligence into three parts, I.E. held that each branch of intelligence has its particular compartment in the brain.</i> The word <i>tevunah</i> (understanding) and also the word <i>binah</i> (reason)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevunah</i> and <i>binah</i> come from the same root and mean the same thing.</i> are related to the word <i>ben</i> (between). They<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevunah</i> and <i>binah</i>.</i> refer to the intellectual faculty that lies in the middle cavity of the brain between knowledge<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Where knowledge is stored.</i> and wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Where wisdom is stored.</i> For wisdom is situated in the posterior cavity of the brain, and knowledge, which is gathered by the senses, is located in the cavities of the brain that are adjacent to the forehead. Knowledge is called <i>al takyil</i> in Arabic. Understanding is called <i>al fakrah</i> and wisdom <i>al hakhmah</i>. Now Bezalel was endowed with every wisdom. He mastered the science of mathematics, geometry, proportions,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>arakhim</i>, one of the categories of medieval science. See <i>erech</i> in J. Klatzkin’s <i>Otzar Ha-Munnachim Ha-Filosofiyim</i>, Vol. I, Berlin, 1928. Also see, H.A.

Hence Scripture prefixes a <i>vav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> means and.</i> to the word <i>kol</i> (and) and reads, <i>u-vekhol melakhah</i> (and in all manner of workmanship).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture wants to indicate that in addition to knowledge of the sciences, Bezalel also possessed knowledge of all manner of workmanship.</i>

Verse 6

WITH HIM. Equal to him in workmanship but not in the science of cutting.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture singles out Bezalel’s skill <i>in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving</i> (literally, cutting) <i>of wood</i> (v. 5). For other interpretations, see Netter, and Krinsky.</i> Observe, the meaning of <i>and in all manner of workmanship</i> is (v. 3) <i>to devise skilful works</i> (v. 4).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, verses 4 and 5 explain the last phrase in verse 3. I.E. explains the meaning of verse 3 here because he deals with Bezalel’s skills.</i>
AND IN THE HEARTS OF ALL THAT ARE WISE-HEARTED I HAVE PUT WISDOM. To do work.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The work for the tabernacle’s construction. According to I.E., <i>and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom</i> should be interpreted as if written: and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom to do the work.</i> Also one finds in human nature the ability to devise intricate geometric forms without ever having studied this science.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E., <i>and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom</i> means: I have endowed these people with the natural ability to create the various designs necessary for the temple’s construction. I.E.’s interpretation solves the problem as to where these men acquired the skill to construct the tabernacle.</i>
[THAT THEY MAY MAKE ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED.] Scripture now goes on to mention all the objects which they were required to make.

Verse 7

THE TENT OF MEETING. Scripture starts with the tent of meeting because it includes everything in the tabernacle. It mentions the ark and the ark cover because of their great importance.
AND ALL THE FURNITURE OF THE TENT. The curtain, the veil, the boards, and the bars. It mentions the table<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">It mentions the table before it mentions the other articles that stood in the sanctuary.</i> in accordance with what I have already noted.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The table had many ritual objects associated with it. See I.E. on Ex. 25:22.</i>

Verse 10

AND THE PLAITED GARMENTS. The <i>bigde ha-serad</i> (the plaited garments) were garments used to cover the ark, the table, the altar, [and] the menorah when journeying.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>bigde ha-serad</i> are not to be identified with the holy garments. See Rashi, “I say, according to the plain meaning of the text it is impossible to maintain that Scripture speaks of the priestly garments.”</i> Scripture goes on to explain, <i>And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made plaited garments</i> (bigde serad) (Ex. 39:1). Each is listed separately<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike Aaron’s garments, each one of the plaited garments was a separate color of wool, blue, purple, or scarlet.</i> as the Torah portion <i>Ba-Midbar Sinai</i> (Num. 4:6-14) states. Scripture then states, [<i>And of the blue, and purple, and the scarlet</i>] <i>they made plaited garments…and</i> [they] <i>made the holy garments</i> [<i>for Aaron</i>] (Ex. 39:1). It then goes on to list them.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It then goes on to list Aaron’s garments in verses 2-26. We thus see that the <i>bigde ha-serad</i> are not to be identified with Aaron’s garments.</i> Observe! The word <i>serad</i> is related to the word <i>sarid</i> (remain) in <i>escape or remain</i> (Jer. 44:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Filwarg explains that <i>sarid</i> means one who remains alone. Hence <i>bigde serad</i> means garments made of one type of material. Meijler explains that the word “remains” indicates a lower quality. He explains that the <i>bigde ha-serad</i> were called the remaining garments because they were inferior to the priestly garments.</i>

Verse 11

FOR THE HOLY PLACE. They are for the need of the holy place.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">“For the holy place” is short for: for the need of the holy place.</i>

Verse 12

SAYING. Every time the word <i>lemor</i> (saying) is used with <i>va-yedabber</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">That is, follows spoke.</i> (he spoke),<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Or <i>va-yomer</i> (spoke) as in our verse.</i> its meaning is, saying to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, when Scripture reads, <i>va-yedabber el moshe lemor</i> (he spoke to him saying), its meaning is, he spoke to Moses, saying to him.</i> Here<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads: <i>va-yomer Adonai el moshe lemor</i> (and the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying). According to I.E. this should be interpreted: And the Lord told Moses to tell the [following to the] children of Israel. [He told him] <i>Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying to them</i> (lemor), <i>Verily ye shall keep My sabbaths</i>. So Zarza, Weiser, Krinsky, Netter, and Sarim.

However, I.E. considers <i>va-yomer</i> and <i>va-yedabber</i> as synonyms.</i>

Verse 13

THOU. Since God commanded Israel to construct the tabernacle, Israel might think that they should occupy themselves with the construction of the tabernacle on the Sabbath. Hence Scripture states, <i>Verily</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, but. I.E. explains the use of the term <i>ach</i> (but).</i><i>ye shall keep My sabbaths</i>. One of the great sages said that it is well-known that only one Sabbath is God’s Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">God rested only on one day, namely, the very first Sabbath. Hence only it is God’s Sabbath.</i> Now, if this is so, then what is the meaning of <i>My sabbaths</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">If only one Sabbath is God’s Sabbath, then our verse should read, <i>My sabbath</i>.</i> He answered that the world will exist for six thousand years.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 31a: “The world will last six thousand years, and one thousand years it will be waste.” The Talmud there explains that Psalm 92, <i>A psalm, a song, for the Sabbath day</i>, refers to the latter. This “Sabbath” is called the Lord’s because on this Sabbath, God’s name alone shall be exalted. Hence our verse speaks of <i>My sabbaths</i>, the reference being to the Sabbath and to the seventh millennium.</i> The seventh millennium and also the Sabbatical year are thus Sabbaths. However, <i>My sabbaths</i> refers to the many Sabbaths of the year.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the plural is employed.</i> Note that we do not find the term <i>shabbat</i> used with reference to the festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the festivals are not included in <i>My sabbaths</i>.</i> The term used is <i>shabbaton</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. See Meijler, Netter, and Weiser. The printed texts read: “Note that we do not find the term Sabbath used with reference to the festivals.

According to the Boethusians the word Sabbath is to be taken literally. See <i>Menachot</i> 66a.</i> The traditional interpretation is correct. However, as I will explain in its place, it requires interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The law contained in Lev. 23:15 refers to the day after the festival of Passover. However, Scripture refers to it as <i>the morrow after the sabbath</i> because the festival of Passover fell on a Sabbath the year this law was given. See I.E. on Lev. 23:11.</i> The Day of Atonement is called Israel’s Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev: 23:32, <i>It</i> (the Day of Atonement) <i>shall be <span class="underline">unto you</span> a sabbath of solemn rest</i> (shabbat shabbaton).</i> not God’s Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is not included in <i>My sabbaths</i>.</i>
FOR IT IS A SIGN. I will explain at the end of the chapter what the Sabbath signifies.
WHO SANCTIFY YOU. When you sanctify the Sabbath, which I sanctified, and refrain from doing any work on the Sabbath day.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, <i>Ye shall keep the Sabbath</i>, etc. that follows.</i>

Verse 14

YE SHALL KEEP THE SABBATH…EVERY ONE THAT PROFANETH IT SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. <i>Mot yumat</i> (he shall surely be put to death) means: it is possible he will be put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">If the circumstances warrant it.</i> It is similar to <i>and its owner also shall be put to death</i> (Ex. 21:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Which is not to be taken literally. See I.E. on Ex. 21:29.</i> The verse stating I [God] will cut off <i>whosoever doeth any work</i> on the Sabbath in secret or in front of a<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Two witnesses are required to establish guilt.</i> witness<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people</i>.</i> is proof of the above.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">That <i>mot yumat</i> does not mean he shall surely be put to death, for not everyone who violates the Sabbath is executed.</i>

Verse 15

SIX DAYS. Scripture goes on to explain that they are permitted to do work on the other six days of the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes issue with the Rabbinic opinion that there is an obligation to work during the six days of the week. See I.E.’s short commentary on Ex. 20:9.</i> The word <i>ye’aseh</i> (shall be done)<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">A masculine.</i> governs the word <i>melakhah</i> (work).<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">A feminine. This presents a problem, for according to Hebrew grammar, verbs and the nouns which they govern must be of the same gender.</i> Perhaps the word <i>kol</i> (any)<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ye’aseh melakhah</i> is short for <i>ye’aseh kol melakah</i> (shall any sort of work be done). Filwarg points out that I.E. is of the opinion that in such cases verbs and nouns do not have to agree. Thus Esth. 1:20 reads: <i>ve-khol ha-nashim yittenu</i> (all the wives will give). <i>Yittenu</i> is masculine. <i>Nashim</i> is feminine. See I.E. on Esth. 1:20.</i> or <i>devar ma’aseh</i> (an act of)<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ye’aseh melakhah</i> is short for <i>ye’aseh devar ma’aseh melakhah (shall an act of work be done</i>). <i>Devar</i> and <i>ma’aseh are</i> masculine. Filwarg suggests interpreting <i>ye’aseh melakhah</i> as short for <i>ye’aseh devar melakhah</i> (shall an act of work be done), or <i>ye’aseh melakhah</i> as short for <i>ye’aseh ma’aseh melakhah</i> (shall acts of work be done).</i> is missing. Now its meaning is, you shall kill him if he does work in public.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath, he shall surely be put to death</i> is: you shall kill him if he does work in public.</i>

Verse 16

SHALL KEEP. They shall keep count of the days of the week so that they do not forget which day is the Sabbath. One shall set his affairs in order and take care of his needs on the sixth day so that he will keep the Sabbath and not desecrate it. 
The meaning of <i>la’asot</i> (to observe)<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>la’asot</i> is, to do or to make. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> in <i>la’asot et ha-shabbat</i> (to observe the Sabbath) is thus similar<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In that in both verses <i>la’asot</i> means to prepare.</i> to the meaning of <i>la’asot</i> (to dress) in <i>and he hastened to dress</i> (la’asot) <i>it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Or prepare it.</i> (Gen. 18:7).

Verse 17

IT IS A SIGN BETWEEN ME AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Scripture employs the terms covenant<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>berit</i>.</i> and sign<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ot</i>.</i> with regard to circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 17:10,11.</i> It does the same with regard to the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 16 and 17. The question thus arises, “Do circumcision and the Sabbath symbolize the same thing?”</i> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says: When people find a male circumcised in such a way that the glans penis is uncovered,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Some ancient peoples practiced partial circumcision. Jewish law requires full circumcision.</i> then they will know that he is an Israelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the use of the term <i>ot</i> (sign).</i> Similarly when a person refrains from doing any work or engaging in business on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">People will know that he is an Israelite. Thus according to Saadiah Gaon the Sabbath is the same sort of sign that circumcision is.</i> However, I believe that the meaning of <i>It is a sign</i> is, <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the Sabbath is a sign that God made heaven and earth in six days.</i> Thus the one who does work on the Sabbath denies the work of creation.
[FOR IN SIX DAYS THE LORD MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH, AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CEASED FROM WORK AND RESTED.] The Torah employs human language so that those who hear its words will understand. Scripture’s statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, Scripture said.</i> <i>And rested</i>, is to be taken metaphorically because <i>God…fainteth not, neither is weary</i> (Is. 40:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, <i>and God rested</i> has nothing to do with God being tired.</i> Look, the hosts of heaven, namely, the glorious corporeal entities<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The planets and stars.</i> which God created, circle the sky day and night eternally.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">They do not tire.</i> This is certainly the case with the glorious incorporeal entities.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The angels. They do not tire.</i> It is most certainly true of the Creator of all, Who Inhabits eternity (Is. 57:15), and <i>is enthroned of old</i> (Ps. 55:20), who does all by command without any movement on His part.

Verse 18

AND HE GAVE. Empty heads ask, “What did Moses do on the mount for forty days and forty nights?” They do not know that if Moses spent this number and double its double in years with God, he would barely know one part of a thousand of God’s work and ways and the secret of all the precepts which God commanded him. They think that deeds are most important.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">They (the empty heads) think that the mere observance of the commandments is the most important element in Judaism.</i> This is not so. What is important is heart together with deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">One must understand the reason for the commandments. According to I.E. this takes a vast amount of time. It should be noted that I.E. wrote a work called <i>Sefer Yesod Morah Ve-Sod Torah</i> (Treatise on the Foundation of Awe and the Secret of the Torah) on the commandments.</i> Heart and tongue train a person [to observe the commandments].<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Some commandments are observed by speech.

Our ancients said, “God desires the heart.”<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>San.</i> 6b.</i> Loving God and cleaving to the Lord with all of one’s soul is the basis of the commandments. This cannot be completely accomplished if a person does not know the ways of the Lord and is not acquainted with God’s work in the upper and lower worlds. The prophet thus states, <i>But let him that glorieth glory in this, That he understandeth and knoweth Me</i> (Jer. 9:23). It will then become clear to a person that God exercises <i>mercy, Justice, and righteous, in the earth</i> (<i>Ibid</i>.).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Maimonides makes the same point in the <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i>.</i> A person cannot know God if he does not know his own spirit, soul, and body. For of what use is a person’s wisdom to him if he does not know the makeup of his soul? Now Moses, who prophesied in the desert for forty years and was party to many secrets which God revealed to him on Mount Sinai, said before his death, <i>O Lord God, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness</i> (Deut. 3:24). Thus it was only then that Moses began to understand God’s greatness and that the Lord’s greatness was shown to him. This is truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Either Deut. 3:24 is not to be taken as hyperbole, or what I.E. has just said is true.</i> for <i>His greatness is unsearchable</i> (Ps. 145:3).

These two sons had already been born when Aaron made the golden calf. They did not participate in the making or the worship of the golden calf.

However, Israel made a calf, not a he-goat. We thus see that Israel’s sin offering was not to atone for the sin of the golden calf. The same must be true of the offering brought by the high priest.</i> The red heifer<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 19.</i> similarly was not brought to atone for idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to atone for the sin of the golden calf. This is the opinion of Rabbi Moshe Ha-Darshan. See Rashi on Num. 19:2.</i> It was brought to purify the unclean. All philosophers admit that God will not choose a person whom He knows will ultimately worship idols to serve as His messenger.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">To serve as His messenger to reveal commandments. Aaron served as such a messenger. See I.E. on Ex. 7:7.</i> Not every prophet is a messenger.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a messenger who reveals God’s commandments to Israel. Only Moses and Aaron served as such. See I.E. 27:19. I.E. comments thus because Jewish tradition considers Solomon and David as prophets. Yet David and Solomon sinned. Hence I.E. differentiates between a mere prophet and a prophet who is sent to reveal commandments.</i> Now Scripture tells us that shortly before Moses died, he said, <i>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one</i> (Deut. 33:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, <i>Whom Thou didst prove at Massah, With whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah</i>. I.E. believes that the verse refers to Aaron. He interprets the first part of the verse as meaning, Aaron is fit to wear the Thummim and Urim because of his piety. He interprets the second part of the verse as meaning that the only stain on Aaron’s piety was the incident at the waters of Meribah. See I.E. on Deut. 33:8.</i> However, he did not mention the incident of the calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">In Deut. 33:8.</i> The only sin found in Aaron was the sin found in Moses, which was the incident of the waters of Meribah,<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">For the incident at the waters of Meribah, see Num. 20:1-12.</i> which I will explain in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 33:8.</i> Some say that Israel fooled Aaron. Israel made a mold of a calf. Aaron was unaware of this and cast the gold into the fire. They offer as proof, <i>I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf</i> (Deut. 32:24). However, this is incorrect, for if Aaron was a fool whom simpletons could deceive, why would God have chosen him? Furthermore, why did Aaron build an altar before the calf and command that Israel slaughter sacrifices and burnt offerings upon it?<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">If Aaron was tricked, he would have been shocked upon seeing the calf. He would not have commanded that an altar be built before the calf and burnt offerings be offered upon it.</i> Others say that the individual named Aaron who made the calf was not Aaron the brother of Moses. This too is nonsense, for the congregation that gathered,<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the congregation that gathered against Aaron and demanded that he make a god for them.</i> only gathered against the one who stood in place of Moses. Scripture clearly states, behold, <i>Aaron and Hur are with you</i> (Ex. 24:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Moses appointed Aaron in his place till he returned.</i> If the one who made the calf was someone else named Aaron, why didn’t Aaron kill him?

For it is not fitting that a pious man make an idol for others so that they do not die. Ibn Ezra here rejects the earlier quoted opinion that Aaron made the calf because he was afraid that God would destroy Israel if they killed Aaron. It should be noted that I.E. occasionally leaves out the first part of a clause. He expects the reader to fill it in.</i> There are also many who say that the meaning of <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</i> (Ex. 32:5) is that those who served the calf would be killed by Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation maintains that <i>a feast</i> (chag) <i>to the Lord</i> refers to the slaughter of the worshippers of the golden calf.</i> But the meaning of <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast</i> (chag) <i>to the Lord</i> can only mean that after Aaron built the altar before the calf, he commanded that an announcement be made in the camp that they should slaughter sacrifices the next day on the altar which he built. The meaning of <i>chag</i> (feast) is a sacrifice, as in <i>bind the offering with thick ropes</i> (Ps. 118:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Translated according to I.E.</i> This is what Israel did, for we read, <i>and they arose early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings</i> (Ex. 31:6). Thoughts are of no avail,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">One should not maintain that while most people understood <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast</i> (chag) <i>to the Lord</i> to mean they would offer sacrifices on the next day, Aaron’s private meaning was: Tomorrow worshippers of the golden calf will be slaughtered.</i> for one who curses God is killed for what he said.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">He cannot claim that his intention was not to curse God.</i> The case is the same with a person who says, <i>Let us go and serve other gods</i> (Deut. 13:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">He is killed for what he said. He cannot claim that he didn’t mean what he said.</i> The one who explains <i>I am Esau thy first-born</i> (Gen. 27:19) as meaning, I am what I am, but Esau is your first-born, is not offering the plain meaning of the text. Neither is he explaining the text in accordance with the rules of rhetoric.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 27:13 (Vol. 1, p. 262) and the notes thereto.</i> If a person asks his neighbor in a law court, “Are you the one to whom I lent the following sum of money?” and his neighbor responds, “I am,” he cannot later say, “What I meant was, I am his neighbor.” The same also applies to what Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar: <i>My lord, the dream</i><sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Nebuchadnezzar had a dream which signified that he would live as a beast for seven years.</i> <i>be to them that hate thee</i> (Dan. 4:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Talmud what Daniel meant was: God (<i>My lord</i>), the dream be upon Nebuchadnezzar (<i>the dream be to them that hate thee</i>).

Rabbi Saadiah said that Aaron, like Jehu, acted with guile.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">King Jehu proclaimed a festival for Baal. His intention was not to serve Baal but to trick the worshippers of Baal to come to Baal’s temple, where Jehu would kill them. See II Kings 10:18-28. Aaron similarly wanted to identify those Israelites who wanted to worship the calf.</i> Hence Aaron built the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Aaron built the altar before the golden calf.</i> Saadiah Gaon raised the following question against his own interpretation: “If Aaron acted with guile, then why was God angry with him?” The Gaon answered that God was angry with Aaron because he did not immediately kill those who worshipped the calf, as Moses did when he arrived. However, this too is incorrect, for Aaron called out, <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</i> (YHVH) (32:5). Aaron employed the name <i>YHVH</i>. This name is a proper noun in honor of the Lord. It is not used for any other being.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">If Aaron intended to trap the idol worshippers he would not have said, <i>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</i> (YHVH), for this is a call to worship <i>YHVH</i> and only <i>YHVH</i>.</i> It is not like the name <i>Elohim</i> (God), which is used in many different ways. Furthermore, why didn’t Aaron mention this when he responded to Moses?<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Moses asked Aaron: <i>What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?</i> (Ex. 32:21).</i> For Aaron said, <i>I cast it into the fire</i> (Ex. 32:24). Aaron’s answer is not in keeping with the question.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron’s answer does not answer Moses’ question.</i> I will now begin to briefly explain part of the secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the true meaning of the account of the making of the golden calf.</i> Far be it, far be it for Aaron to make an idol. Israel also did not ask for an idol. What happened was that Israel thought that Moses, who, as I have explained, had led them on their journey from the Red Sea, had died,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. believes that Moses, rather than the pillar of fire, led Israel from the Red Sea to the wilderness of Sinai. See I.E. on Ex. 15:22.</i> for Israel noticed that the manna did not come down at Mount Sinai. Furthermore, Moses tarried on the mountain for forty days. A human being does not have the stamina to live that long without food. Also, Moses did not tell them when he would descend.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">If Moses had told them that he would be on the mount for forty days, they would not have assumed that he died there.</i> Moses himself did not know this, for God told him, “Come up to Me onto the mount and be there until I give you the tablets of stone.”<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of Ex. 24:12.</i> The word <i>elohim</i> (god) refers to a glorious being dwelling in an image of a body.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Israel did not ask Aaron to make an idol. They requested that he make an image which had the power to lead them. Thus <i>aseh lanu elohim</i> (Ex. 32:1) does not mean: make us a god. It means: make us an image which will be inhabited by a heavenly power.</i> Israel said as follows: <i>who shall go before us</i> (Ex. 32:l).<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Israel said: <i>Up, make us a god</i> (elohim) <i>who shall go before us</i> (Ex. 32:1). We thus see that they sought an <i>elohim</i> who would lead them.</i> If you pay attention to Israel’s first journey<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Israel’s first journey from Egypt.</i> you will understand this.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture tells us that when Israel left Egypt, <i>the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire</i> (Ex. 13:21). After Egypt drowned in the Red Sea, Moses led Israel. See note 158. Now that Moses was dead, Israel sought a substitute for Moses. See I.E.’s short commentary: “They only sought someone to go before them to find them a resting place.”</i> The calf was thus made for the glory of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">God’s spirit was to rest on the calf and lead them in the same way that it rested in the pillars of fire and cloud. See I.E. on Ex. 13:21.</i> Hence Aaron built an altar before the calf and announced that they should offer sacrifices on the morrow for the glory of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">His spirit would rest on the calf.</i> Israel did as Aaron commanded them. Aaron’s answer was<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron did not actually say this. I.E.’s point is that Ex. 32:1 can be quoted in Aaron’s defense.</i> that the people gathered themselves upon him (Ex. 32:l).<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that Aaron did not make the calf on his own. The people gathered upon him and demanded that he make an <i>elohim</i> to lead them.</i> I have already noted that whenever the verb <i>kahal</i> (gathered) is followed by the word <i>al</i> (upon) it has a negative connotation.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 32:1.</i> However, if it is followed by the word <i>el</i> (to), as in <i>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves</i> (va-yikkhal) <i>unto</i> (el) <i>king Solomon</i> (I Kings 8:2), then it has a positive connotation. This is the meaning of <i>thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil</i> (Ex. 32:22). The meaning of the verse is: I did not do evil to them. For they merely asked for a being that would go before them.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>Make us a god, which shall go before us</i> (Ex. 32:23).</i> I made the calf for the glory of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation of <i>and I cast it into the fire and there came out this calf</i> (Ex. 24:24).</i> However, [the calf became an object of worship] because there was a mixed multitude among Israel. This what Aaron meant by <i>ve-ra hu</i> (they are set on evil).<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>ve-ra hu</i> means there is evil in him; that is, some of the people are evil (Weiser).</i> Aaron did not say <i>ra hu</i> (they are evil). A small group of Israelites thought that the calf was an idol. They brought sacrifices and bowed to the calf and said, <i>This is thy god, O Israel</i> (Ex. 32:4). Do not be amazed that Scripture states, <i>for thy people</i><sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Thy people</i> implies that all the people sinned.</i>…<i>have dealt corruptly; they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them</i> (Ex. 32:7,8), for Scripture does not say all thy people.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Thus only some of them sinned.</i> Can you not see that Achan alone violated the ban<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition against taking any loot from Jericho for personal use. See Josh. 6:17.</i> and yet Scripture states, <i>Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant…and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff</i> (Josh. 7:11). Now, only three thousand Israelites,<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible tells us that the Levites executed 3,000 Israelites for worshipping the calf (Ex. 32:28).</i> which comes to a half of a tenth of a tenth of the Israelite camp,<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">That is, one half of a percent, for 3,000 is half of a percent of 600,000.

The sum of the matter is that we would not be acting properly if we maintain that the calf was made to serve as an idol as the simple-minded believe. Do not be surprised that God was furious with Aaron, because he was<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">He was inadvertently the cause of their sin.</i> the cause of their sin. For look, Aaron was punished along with his brother Moses concerning the incident at the waters of Meribah.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 20:1-13.</i> However, Moses and Aaron did not deliberately sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture charges Moses and Aaron with disbelief, rebellion, etc., even though they did not deliberately sin against God.</i> Nevertheless, Scripture states regarding them, <i>Because ye believed not in Me</i> (Num. 20:12); <i>ye rebelled</i> (Num. 27:14), and <i>ye trespassed against Me</i> (Deut. 33:51). The astrologers say that the great conjunction of the two upper bodies<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Meijler believes that the reference is to the sun and the moon.

Many have tested this secret, generation after generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">They have found that Israel’s luck improves when the above heavenly bodies are propitiously aligned in Aquarius.</i> I too have seen this to be the case. Look! They placed it at the midpoint of the sky.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">They made the calf at the time when the sun was at the midpoint of the sky beneath Aquarius (Meijler). Or they made the calf when Aquarius was at the mid-point of the sky (Weiser). Either way, I.E.’s point is that they made the calf when Aquarius was in the most favorable position.</i>

Verse 4

AND HE RECEIVED IT AT THEIR HAND, AND FASHIONED IT WITH A GRAVING TOOL.

A MOLTEN CALF. The word <i>masekhah</i> means molten. It is similar to the word <i>nasakh</i> (hath melted)<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It comes from the same root.</i> in <i>The image perchance, which the craftsman hath melted</i> (Is. 40:19).

Verse 9

AND THE LORD SAID. <i>Stiffnecked</i> means that they refuse to do as God commanded. They are like a person who runs along on his way and does not turn his head back to the one who calls him. This expression is employed with regard to the Israelites for the following reason. Scripture tells us that Israel served idols in Egypt. It reports that God sent prophets to them saying, “Let every man cast away the idols of Egypt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 20:7.</i> Moses related this incident<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The account of the golden calf.</i> to their children<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">To the next generation.</i> before he died.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the account of the making of the golden calf is recapitulated in the Book of Deuteronomy. See Deut. 9:7-29.</i> Moses employed different terminology. However, the import of the words is the same as here. Scripture here states that God told Moses, <i>Go, get thee down; for thy people…have dealt corruptly</i> (v. 7). However, Moses later quoted God as saying, <i>Arise, get thee down</i> (Deut. 19:12). Scripture there<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser suggests this is an error for “here.” However, it is possible that since the last quote is from Deuteronomy, I.E. refers to Exodus as “there,” even though he is now commenting on Exodus.</i> writes, <i>This is thy god, O Israel</i> (v. 8).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">There is no parallel to this clause in Deuteronomy.</i> Scripture goes on to say here, <i>Now therefore let Me alone</i> (ve-attah ha-nichah li) (v. 10). However, it later reads, <i>let Me alone</i> (heref mi-menni) (Deut. 9:14). Scripture here reads, <i>that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them</i> (v. 10). However, it later reads, <i>that I may destroy them and blot out their name</i> (Deut. 9:14). Scripture here reads, <i>and I will make of thee a great nation</i> (v. 10). However, Moses later quoted God as saying, <i>and I will make of thee a nation mightier</i> [<i>and greater than they</i>] (Deut. 9:14). The meanings are the same.

Verse 10

NOW THEREFORE LET ME ALONE, THAT MY WRATH MAY WAX HOT AGAINST THEM, AND THAT I MAY CONSUME THEM.] God hinted to Moses that were He not concerned with Moses’ glory, He would destroy Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore <i>let Me alone</i> implies that Moses is preventing God from destroying Israel.</i> Hence Moses was compelled to pray.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Once God informed Moses that he could hold back God’s wrath, Moses felt compelled to do so and thus save Israel.</i>

Verse 11

AND MOSES BESOUGHT. We encounter verbs from the root <i>chet, lamed, heh</i> that have this meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Of besought or assuaged.</i> only with regard to the face. Compare, <i>Many will entreat</i> (yechallu) <i>the favour of the liberal man</i> (Prov. 19:6).

According to I.E., “And her face was no more” means, and her anger was no more.

The sequence of events was as follows: Moses descended, burned the calf, and killed its worshippers. He then returned to pray to God on behalf of Israel and on behalf of Aaron,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 9:20.</i> who was the cause.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As he actually made the calf.</i> Others say that the prayer <i>O Lord God, destroy not Thy people</i> (Deut. 9:26) is not the prayer which is mentioned here.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the prayer recorded in Deut. 9:26-29 is not to be identified with the one recorded in Ex. 32:11-14.</i> I believe that the contents of both prayers are the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, though their wordings differ, they are one and the same prayer.</i> I will later explain this point. For how could Moses beg God [not to destroy Israel] before he burned the calf, caused Israel to drink, and killed its worshippers?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the prayer recorded in Ex. 32:11-14 could not have been offered before Moses came down from the mount.</i> God only hinted to Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on verse 10.</i> that he should pray after he descended and removed the calf. Hence after Moses removed their sin<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">That is, after Moses burned the calf.</i> Scripture reads, <i>peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin</i> (v. 30). We similarly read, <i>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made</i>, [<i>and burnt it with fire</i>] (Deut. 9:21). It was only because God told Moses, <i>Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them</i> (v. 10) that Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">At this point.</i> mentioned the prayer that he prayed<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">That he later prayed.</i> when he fell down before the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">After burning the calf and returning to the mountain.</i> Actually, this chapter<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Moses’ prayer, verses 11-14.</i> should have been written after <i>And Moses returned unto the Lord</i> (v. 31). However, there is no chronological order in the Torah. Scripture was only concerned with connecting the statement <i>Whosoever hath sinned against Me</i>, [<i>him will I blot out</i>] (v. 33) with <i>And now go, lead the people</i> (v. 34).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Which it couldn’t do if Moses’ prayer was reproduced at this point. However, if the Torah was in chronological order Moses’ prayer would have been inserted between verse 32 and verse 33 (Meijler).</i> Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In keeping with verse 33.</i> goes on to state, <i>And the Lord smote the people</i> (v. 35).
BESOUGHT. Look.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. now goes on to point out that the accounts of the golden calf as given in Deuteronomy and Exodus do not contradict each other. He similarly points out that the prayer offered by Moses here and in Deuteronomy are the same even though there is a difference in wording on some points.</i> Scripture writes, <i>So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because the Lord had said he would destroy you</i> (Deut. 9:25). This is what <i>let Me alone, that I may destroy them</i> (Deut. 9:14) refers to.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. has earlier explained that it was a hint to Moses that he should pray.</i> The mind cannot accept the idea that Moses prayed on behalf of Israel while an idol was among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Hence, unlike Exodus, Deuteronomy does not report that Moses prayed at this point. I.E. earlier explained why Exodus does report the prayer at this point. The main thrust of I.E.’s comment is that Exodus and Deuteronomy do not contradict each other on this point.</i> He first removed the idol. 
Now, <i>Lord, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse.</i> is similar to <i>O Lord God, destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance</i> (Deut. 9:26). Scripture then goes on to say, <i>that Thou didst bring out by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm</i> (Deut. 9:29). This is parallel to <i>that Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse.</i> Scripture writes, <i>Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i> (Deut. 9:27). This is parallel to <i>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear by Thine own self</i> (v. 13). Its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i> (Deut. 9:27).</i> is, remember the oath which you swore to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</i> Scripture does not mention the oath in the verse that reads, <i>Remember Thy servants</i> (Deut. 9:27). For there is a difference in meaning between <i>zekhor la’avadekha</i> (remember Thy servants) (Deut. 9:27) and <i>zekhor adatekha</i> (remember Thy congregation) in <i>Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast gotten of old</i> (Ps. 74:2), because of the <i>lamed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Prefaced to <i>la-avadekha</i> (Thy servants) in Deuteronomy 9:27. <i>Zekhor la-avadekha</i> means remember the oath. <i>Zekhor avadekha</i>, which is similar to <i>zekhor adatekha</i>, means Remember Thy servants. I.E.’s point is that Deut. 9:27 is parallel to Ex. 32:13 even though the oath is not explicitly mentioned in Deut. 9:27.</i> Now, <i>lest the land whence Thou broughtest us out say</i> (Deut. 9:28) is parallel to <i>Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying</i> (v. 12). 

Verse 12

[FOR EVIL DID HE BRING THEM FORTH.] The meaning of <i>be-ra’a hotzi’am</i> (for evil did He bring them forth) is, as our ancients hint,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The rabbis in the Midrash.

Hence when He saw that He was unable to overcome the star, He killed them.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites. The idea that God overcomes nature and the astrological arrangements is an important theme in I.E.’s thought. See I.E. on Gen. 17:1.</i> This will desecrate God’s name.

They will thus not inherit the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Without God in their midst they would not be able to inherit the land. Literally, they did not inherit the land. Weiser suggests emending <i>yarshu</i> (did not inherit) to <i>yireshu</i> (will inherit).</i> Moses then said everything contained in the portion that opens with the words, See, <i>Thou sayest unto me</i> (Ex. 33:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Namely, Ex. 33:12-16.

Verse 13



Verse 14

AND THE LORD REPENTED. Heaven forbid for the Lord to repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">To change His mind. Medieval Jewish philosophers taught that God is unchanging. This verse thus presented a problem to them.</i> Rather, Scripture employed human terminology. Compare, <i>And God went up</i> (Gen. 35:13);<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 11:5.</i> <i>And the Lord came down</i> (Gen. 11:5);<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on this verse.</i> <i>Let the Lord rejoice in His works</i> (Ps. 105:31), and, <i>And it grieved Him at His heart</i> (Gen. 6:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on this verse.</i> Look, Samuel said, <i>And also the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent</i> (I Sam. 15:29). Nevertheless, Scripture there reads, <i>It repenteth Me</i> (I Sam. 15:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the term repent when applied to God is to be taken literally; otherwise I Sam. 15:11 would contradict I Sam. 15:29.</i> There are those who explain<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is probably to Saadiah Gaon. See Gen. 27:42.</i> <i>va-yinachem</i> (repented) by the Arabic word <i>wa’ad</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning to set a time. According to this interpretation, God set a time to punish the people, i.e., those who worshipped the calf. However, he promised to spare those who were not involved in worshipping the golden calf.</i> However, there is no need for this.

Verse 15

AND MOSES TURNED. Scripture here tells us,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Deuteronomy here mentions.</i> <i>and the mount burned with fire</i> (Deut. 9:15). The meaning of <i>and Moses turned</i> is that Moses looked around like a person who looks around and contemplates his course of action<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>va-yifen</i> (turned) is to be taken metaphorically. Its meaning is, he contemplated his course of action (Sarim).</i>. Moses saw that he had to descend quickly. <i>Va-yifen</i> (turned) here is similar to <i>va-yifen koh va-kho</i> (and he looked this way and that way) (Ex. 2:12).
[IN HIS HAND.] In his possession.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>in his hand</i> is to be interpreted as in his hands (Filwarg).</i> It is similar to <i>And take with thee ten men</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">There is no such verse. The reference is probably to I Kings 14:3, <i>And take with thee ten loaves</i>. On the other hand, the reference might be to <i>Take from hence thirty men with thee</i> (Jer. 38:10).</i> For we cannot understand how Moses was able to bring down one tablet in his hand. It is next to impossible to believe that he carried down two tablets in his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">It is I.E.’s belief not to exaggerate the miracles recorded in Scripture. This stands in marked contrast to the rabbis of the Midrash, who tended to magnify the miracles recorded in Scripture.</i>
[TABLES THAT WERE WRITTEN ON BOTH THEIR SIDES.] Now since Scripture explicitly tells us that the tablets were written on both sides, they could not have been made out of any of the stones that are mentioned with regard to the breastplate,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 28:17-20. These stones were translucent.</i> for what was seen on one side would then be seen on the other side. The word <i>ketuvim</i> (written) does not mean seen.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">If it did, then it is possible to identify the stones from which the tablets were hewn with one of the stones on the breastplate.</i> <i>Ketuvim</i> means written. Scripture tells us that what was written on one side was also written on the other side.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">For Scripture reads, <i>tables that were written on both their sides</i>.</i> Each tablet was thus thick. There is no need to assume that the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> which were inscribed in the tablets were miraculously suspended,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rabbi Chisda. See <i>Megillah</i> 2b and <i>Sabbath</i> 104a. Rabbi Chisda believed that the writing on the tablets was cut through the stone. Most letters of the alphabet are so shaped that it is possible to inscribe them in this manner. However, the final <i>mem</i> and <i>samekh</i> are round and cannot be so engraved. Hence Rabbi Chisda says that these letters stood on the tablets miraculously. I.E., as will soon be seen, disagrees with this interpretation.</i> for there is a difference of opinion regarding the meaning of the term <i>ashurit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew square script is called <i>ketav ashuri</i>. There is a difference of opinion in the Talmud as to the origin of this term. See <i>San.</i> 22a.</i> Some believe that the word <i>ashurit</i> means a praise-worthy script.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>she-me’usheret be-khetav</i>. See <i>San.</i> 22a. According to this opinion the square script was the one in which the tablets were written. The Talmud, which maintains that the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> were miraculously suspended on the tablets, accepts this opinion. So does I.E. in his comments on Ex. 1:9. Nevertheless, he argues that one does not have to assume that the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> were miraculously suspended on the tablets, as he believes that the tablets were written on both sides and not chiseled through.</i> Others maintain that it refers to the script which they brought up from Assyria.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ashur</i>. Hence the term <i>ashurit</i>. According to this opinion the Torah was given in <i>ketav ivri</i>, the ancient Hebrew script. In this script neither the <i>samekh</i> nor the <i>mem</i> is oval. According to this opinion there is no need to assume that the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> were miraculously suspended on the tablets. I.E. quotes these two opinions in order to show that the rabbis themselves were divided as to whether the <i>mem</i> and the <i>samekh</i> were miraculously suspended on the tablets.</i> Furthermore, if the letters were visible on the reverse side, then the letters would appear backwards.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">They could thus be read on only one side. What point would there be then for the writing to be chiseled through?</i> There is no room for one to argue with me and ask whether these stones were precious.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">According to an earlier opinion quoted by I.E. the tablets were made of precious stones. I.E. disagreed with this opinion. Now one can object to I.E.’s rejection of this opinion on the ground that it is inconceivable that the divine tablets would be made of ordinary stone.</i> The answer is that the stones were very precious because the writing of God was engraved upon them. The stones had to be thick. Where would Moses find very precious stones that were a cubit in length, a cubit and a half in width,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">For the dimensions of the tablets, see I.E.’s comment on Ex. 25:10. I.E. there explains that the tablets were a cubed cubit. The words “and a half” thus appear to be an error. It was the ark that was a cubit and a half in width. Hence the error.</i> and a cubit in height? Furthermore, where would Moses get the raw material to hew out two tablets of precious stones of the same dimensions as the first stones? Now we do not know the way the Ten Statements were written on the two tablets without Moses having to turn them over.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>tables that were written on both their sides</i> implies that some of the Statements were written on one side of the tablet and others on the reverse side. Thus Moses had to turn them around to read them or show their complete comments to the people. Hence Scripture goes on to say, <i>on the one side and on the other side were they written;</i> i.e., what was written on one side was written on the other side.</i> Hence after telling us <i>that were written on both their sides</i>, Scripture goes on to say, <i>on the one side and on the other side were they written</i>. We have no way of knowing whether each one of the tablets was completely covered with writing, or whether some blank spaces were left on the four corners as we do today with our books. We similarly do not know whether the writing was thick or thin. There is no reason for us to speculate concerning things for which we do not have a tradition.

Verse 16

AND THE TABLES WERE THE WORK OF GOD. Our ancients said that it was decreed<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">On the eve of the Sabbath of creation.</i> that they be like this.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that the tablets come into being.

Hence <i>Avot</i> 5:6 may be interpreted as meaning, on the eve of the Sabbath, God decreed that ten things come into being.</i> However, I believe that the meaning of <i>the work of God</i> is that they were created in their proper dimensions.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That is, that the tablets were now created by God (Meijler).</i> This is mentioned because of the second tablets, which Moses hewed out.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, these tablets were the work of God but the second were shaped by Moses.

Verse 17

AND WHEN JOSHUA HEARD. And when Joshua, who remained at the foot of the mountain, heard.

The root of <i>be-re’o</i> is <i>yod, resh, ayin</i>.

Verse 18

AND HE SAID. Saadiah Gaon says that Joshua also said this.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>And he said</i> refers to Joshua.</i> However, I believe that these are the words of Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>And he said</i> refers to Moses.</i> <i>And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp</i> which follows (v. 19) is proof of this.

THE NOISE OF THEM THAT SING. <i>Anot</i> (that sing) means tunes. This is what <i>and rose up to make merry</i> refers to (v. 6).

THAT HE SAW THE CALF AND THE DANCING. The <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">The prefix letter <i>heh</i> means the.</i> prefixed to the word <i>egel</i> (calf) also refers to the word <i>u-mecholot</i> (and the dancing).

Verse 20

AND HE TOOK THE CALF. Some say that the meaning of <i>and burnt it with fire</i> is that he melted it in fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">For gold does not burn, it melts.</i> However, there is no need for this, for there is a substance<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">We do not know what I.E. is referring to.</i> which, when put into the fire along with the gold, causes the gold to immediately catch fire, turn black, and never again turn back into gold.

AND STREWED IT UPON THE WATER. The reference is to the water from the brook that descended out of the mountain.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 9:17.</i> Moses commanded all of Israel to drink from these waters. This was similar to <i>and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water</i> (Num. 5:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the water given to a woman suspected of adultery.

Verse 25

AND WHEN MOSES SAW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE BROKEN LOOSE. The word <i>paru’a</i> (broken loose) is similar to <i>yippare’a</i> (cast off restraint) in <i>Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint</i> (Prov. 28:18), and <i>va-tifre’u</i> (ye have set at nought) in <i>But ye have set at nought all my counsel</i> (Prov. 1:25).

It is the practice of all camps that stay in one place for about a year<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Israel camped at Sinai for a little less than a year. See Ex. 19:1 and Num. 10:11.</i> to erect booths and have gates.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the camp of Israel had a gate.</i> In such a case, there is no need to set aside a place outside the camp as a latrine.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">As required by Deut. 23:13. If the camp had latrines outside its walls, it would make no sense for it to have a gate, for the gate would have to be open at all times so that people could use the latrine at all times. Hence I.E. points out that walled camps would have the latrine within their walls. See I.E. on Ex. 29:45.</i>
WHOSO IS ON THE LORD’S SIDE. Shall draw close to me; shall come near to me; shall come to me or shall gather to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse reads, <i>mi la-Adonai elai</i>, which literally means whoso is on the Lord’s side to me. Hence the various interpretations.</i>
THE SONS OF LEVI. Who were of Moses’ family.

Verse 27

AND HE SAID UNTO THEM. Moses referred to the Lord as the God of Israel because those who worshipped the calf thought that the Lord was to be identified with the calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The worshippers of the calf referred to it as the god of Israel (v. 4). Hence Moses emphasized that the Lord, not the calf, was the God of Israel.</i>
AND SLAY EVERY MAN HIS BROTHER. Even if it be his brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">If the worshipper happens to be his brother.</i> Many interpret <i>Who said of his father, and of his mother: I have not seen him</i> (Deut. 33:9) as referring to this incident.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yoma</i> 66:2: <i>“Who said of his father, and of his mother: I have not seen him, his father</i> refers to the father of his mother, who is an Israelite.”</i> They had to explain <i>his father and his mother</i> as referring to the father of the mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">For none of the Levites worshipped the calf.</i> However, as I will explain, there is no need for this interpretation.

Verse 28

AND THE SONS OF LEVI DID. Not all the sons of Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">All the sons of Levi gathered in response to Moses’ call, <i>Whoso is on the Lord’s side, let him come unto me</i> (v. 26). However, they didn’t all participate in the slaying of the worshippers of the calf. Hence, unlike verse 26, which reads, <i>And all the sons of Levi gathered</i>, our verse reads, <i>and the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses</i>, omitting the word all.</i>

Verse 29

AND MOSES SAID. Its meaning is, and Moses already said to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Thug <i>va-yomer</i> is a pluperfect. Our verse literally reads, “Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, every man against his son, and against his brother.” Logic dictates that Moses said this to the Levites before they went out to slay the worshippers of the calf.</i> It is similar to <i>Then the Lord God formed</i> (Gen. 2:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Which according to I.E. should be interpreted, and the Lord God had already formed. See I.E. on Gen. 2:7.</i> There are many other such examples.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Of the use of the pluperfect in Scripture.</i>
[CONSECRATE.] The word <i>milu</i> (consecrate), which is in the <i>kal</i>, is grammatically irregular. It is sometimes transitive and at other times intransitive.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser explains that I.E believed the word <i>milu</i> in our verse to be transitive. He interpreted our verse as meaning, fill your hands with a blessing.</i>
[FOR EVERY MAN HATH BEEN AGAINST HIS SON.] Even if the worshipper be his son or brother he must kill him. They will be rewarded with a blessing for doing this. This is what <i>At that time</i><sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">When Israel made the golden calf. See I.E. on Deut. 10:7.</i> <i>the Lord separated the tribe of Levi</i> (Deut. 10:8) refers to. Its meaning is that God told Moses at Mount Sinai the reason the tribe of Levi was set aside. Scripture therefore reads, <i>Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the Lord spoke with Moses in mount Sinai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the meaning of <i>that the Lord spoke with Moses in mount Sinai</i> is that the Lord spoke with Moses regarding the separation of the tribe of Levi. Num. 3:1-10 deals with the separation of the tribe of Levi. Hence I.E.’s interpretation.</i> (Num. 3:1). Now Aaron, his sons, and the Levites were separated<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">In practice.</i> to serve the Lord at the time that the tabernacle was erected. Korah’s quarrel<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 16:1-34.</i> took place at that time. Korah was a first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 6:22.</i> Korah rebelled when God set aside the Levites in place of the first-born who were holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 3:45. Korah rebelled because he would no longer be permitted to do the temple service, for Levites, although holy, could not perform priestly duties.</i> God did this because the first-born<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the tribe of Levi.</i> brought the burnt offerings before the calf and they slaughtered peace offerings upon the altar, which was made before the calf.

Verse 30

AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE MORROW. Following his descent.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>mi-mochorat</i> is short for <i>mi-mochorat yom rideto</i>.</i>
AND NOW I WILL GO UP. To return to the mountain to fall before the Lord and atone for Israel as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on verse 11.</i> Perhaps God will write another pair of tablets in order to make a covenant with Israel. This is the meaning of <i>Behold, I make a covenant</i> (Ex. 34:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">The second tablets served as evidence of God’s covenant with Israel.</i> For the tablets were, as it were, a document of witness.

Verse 31

AND MOSES RETURNED. The Nagid<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Samuel the Nagid of Granada, Talmudist, poet, and statesman (993-1056 C.E.).</i> says that a <i>lamed</i> has been dropped and compensated for<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">By the <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>nun of anna</i>.</i> in the word <i>anna</i> (oh), which is short for <i>al na</i> (please consent). He maintains that the word <i>al</i><sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>al na</i>.</i> is related to the word <i>ho’il</i> (consent).<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">That is, please consent to my request.</i> However, this is far-fetched. On the contrary, its meaning is: please (<i>anna</i>) don’t do this.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse <i>anna</i> means please or I confess. Its implication is, please (or I confess the following but) do not do this (Meijler).</i> <i>Anna</i> is an expression of appeasement,<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a call to reconciliation (Krinsky).</i> or confession, as here.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">In our verse.</i> <i>Anna</i> (I beseech Thee) in <i>I beseech Thee, O Lord, for I am Thy servant</i> (Ps. 116:16) is similar.

Verse 32

YET NOW…BLOT ME, I PRAY THEE, OUT OF THY BOOK. I have already explained in my comments on <i>And the books were opened</i>, in the Book of Daniel (7:10), that all the decrees regarding masses and individuals are contingent upon the arrangements in the sky.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, God’s book refers to the arrangements of the stars.</i> Our sages have already admitted that children, longevity, and prosperity [depend upon the influence of the stars].<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 28a: “Raba said: longevity, children, and prosperity are not contingent on one’s merits but on one’s star.”</i> However, God, as I have explained, increases the good which the heavenly arrangements have decreed because of a person’s fear of the Lord.

Verse 33

AND THE LORD SAID. Saadiah Gaon says that this is what <i>And the Lord repented</i> (v. 14) refers to, for God had said that He would destroy all.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">All of Israel. See verse 10. He now repented and said that He would destroy only those who had sinned against Him.</i> The meaning of our verse is: Look. I will blot out of My book only those who sinned against Me in their minds.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Even if they didn’t worship the calf in practice. I.E. comments thus because those who actually had worshipped the calf had already been killed.</i> The aforementioned is to be understood after the manner of <i>that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart</i> (Ezek. 14:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of which is, I will punish the House of Israel for the sins which they committed in their hearts, the reference being to idolatry.</i> They were not killed<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">By the Levites.</i> because they did not actually worship the calf. This is the meaning of: And the Lord smote the people, because the calf was made and doubt<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they thought that the calf was a god. They thus doubted the truth of the existence of only one God.</i> came to people privately.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s interpretation and paraphrase of verse 35.</i>

Verse 34

AND NOW GO, LEAD THE PEOPLE UNTO THE PLACE OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN UNTO THEE. That is, <i>unto the place of the Canaanite</i> (Ex. 3:8). This was said in anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the place is not mentioned.</i> God told Moses, I have forgiven their sin because of you. Now you, who love them so much, go lead them.
IN THE DAY. The beginning of every year is the day of accounting.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">On the day when God judges each individual he will take the person’s sin into consideration.</i>

Verse 35

AND THE LORD SMOTE. It is possible that there was no plague in the first year.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">The number of Israelites did not diminish between the first census, which took place before the erection of the tabernacle (Ex. 38:26), and the second census a month after the erection of the tabernacle (Num. 1:1).</i> The Torah merely reports what happened after they journeyed from Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>And the Lord smote</i>, etc., refers to what happened to Israel after they journeyed from Mount Sinai on the twentieth day of the second month in the second year following the Exodus (Num 10:11).</i>

Chapter 33



Verse 1

AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES: DEPART, GO UP HENCE. Scripture reads <i>go up</i> because one who goes towards the left side<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">That is, goes north. For when a person faces east, north is on his left side.</i> goes up.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Land of Israel is north of the desert of Sinai. Hence Scripture states, <i>go up</i>.</i> Abraham therefore went down into Egypt (Gen. 12:10)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Scripture speaks of Abraham’s journey to Egypt in terms of going down. See Gen. 12:10, <i>And Abram went down into Egypt</i>.</i> because he was in the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When he came to Egypt. Our texts read, <i>ki hu be-darom</i> (because he was in the south). Sarim suggests emending our text to read, <i>ki hi be-darom</i> [for it (Egypt) is in the south].</i>
[JACOB.] I will do all of this<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Sending an angel before the Israelites, driving out the inhabitants of Canaan, and giving their land to the Israelites.</i> because of the oath which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Verse 2

AND I WILL SEND AN ANGEL BEFORE THEE. To help you.
[AN ANGEL.] Scripture does not read <i>the</i> angel<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It reads <i>an</i> angel (<i>malakh</i>).</i> because <i>the</i> angel<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ha-malakh</i>.</i> refers to the angel which is known to have God’s name in him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 23:20-23.</i>

Verse 3

FOR I WILL NOT GO UP IN THE MIDST OF THEE. They will not erect the tabernacle,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The construction of which was described earlier.</i> for I will not rest in the midst of Israel.
[LEST I CONSUME THEE IN THE WAY.] I will immediately consume them if they once again act in this manner. <i>Akhelkha</i> (I consume thee) is vocalized with a <i>segol</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Beneath the <i>kaf</i>.</i> in place of a <i>pattach</i>, and its <i>lamed</i> does not have a <i>dagesh</i> in it even though the rules of grammar require it.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That the word be vocalized with a <i>pattach</i> beneath the <i>kaf</i> and that a <i>dagesh</i> be placed in the <i>lamed</i>.</i> Compare the word <i>achavvekha</i> (I will tell thee)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>akhelkha</i> should have followed the vocalization of <i>achavvekha</i>.</i> in <i>I will tell thee, hear thou me</i> (Job 15:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">It should be noted that in our editions of Scripture the <i>vav</i> of <i>achavvekha</i> does not have a <i>dagesh</i> in it. However, it is obvious that it did in I.E.’s edition. See <i>Minchat Shai</i> on Job 15:17.</i>

Verse 4

AND WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THESE EVIL TIDINGS. What evil tidings?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Evil tidings are recorded in verse 3 and in verse 5. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> The reference is to what is written afterwards, <i>And the Lord said unto Moses</i>, etc. (v. 5).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, verse 5 should come before verse 4. I.E. comments thus because verse 4 tells us, <i>and no man did put on him his ornaments</i>. However, verse 5 reads, <i>And the Lord said unto Moses…therefore now put off thy ornaments</i>. Hence <i>And the Lord said</i> should be interpreted, and the Lord had said (Weiser).</i> <i>And the Lord said unto Moses</i> (Ex. 4:19) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Here too the meaning of <i>and the Lord said</i> is, and the Lord had said. See I.E. on Ex. 4:19.</i> I have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to I.E.’s comments on Ps. 78:20.</i> the meaning of <i>Can He give bread also</i> (Ps. 78:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. <i>bread</i> refers to meat, not to the manna (I.E. on Ps. 78:20). I.E. comments thus because the first part of Ps. 78:20 reads, <i>Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out</i>. Therefore <i>Can He give bread also</i>, which follows, cannot refer to the manna, for the manna fell before the rock was struck (see Ex. 16,17:1-8). I.E. explains <i>bread</i> to mean meat, as Israel asked for meat after the rock had been struck. See Num. 11:1-22.</i> It<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> is like <i>And He commanded the skies above</i> (Ps. 78:23),<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the manna which fell from heaven.</i> the meaning of which is, and He had already commanded the skies.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For the manna fell before the striking of the rock which is earlier mentioned. See note 16.</i> This is also the case here.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And the Lord said</i> (v. 5) means, and the Lord had already said. I.E. comments thus because he believes that what is reported in verse 5 transpired before that which is reported in verse 4. See note 14.</i> There is no need for the Geonic interpretation to the effect that they always did so.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 reads, that they should always do so. The point is that verse 5 is in correct chronological sequence, for it relates that God told Israel that they must permanently keep their jewelry off. Thus <i>And the Lord said unto Moses</i> is to be taken literally.</i>

Verse 5



Verse 6

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL STRIPPED THEMSELVES OF THEIR ORNAMENTS. <i>Et edyam</i> means of their ornaments.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Et</i> here has the meaning of <i>min</i> (from). I.E. comments thus because <i>va-yitnatzelu</i> (stripped themselves) is a reflexive verb. Therefore, if we do not translate <i>et</i> as <i>min</i>, our verse would read, <i>and the children of Israel stripped themselves their ornaments</i>.</i> The reference is to their fine garments and ornaments such as rings worn on the ears and fingers. The word <i>edyam</i> is to be interpreted in light of <i>va-edekh edi</i> (I decked thee also with ornaments) (Ezek. 16:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 16:11 tells us that God decked Israel with ornaments. It then goes on to list the ornaments. It mentions earrings, nose rings, beautiful and costly garments, bracelets, and necklaces. See Ezek. 16:11-13.</i> Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments because they mourned over the incident of the calf.

Verse 7

NOW MOSES USED TO TAKE THE TENT. Scripture employs an imperfect<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yikkach</i>. <i>Yikkach</i> means will take. J.P.S. renders used to take.</i> in place of a perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lakach</i> (took).</i> We find the same in <i>They made a calf in Horeb</i> (Ps. 106:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 106:19 employs the future, <i>ya’asu</i> (they will make), in place of the perfect, <i>asu</i>.</i>
THE TENT. His tent.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The tent</i> means Moses’ tent. Hence the <i>heh</i> (the) prefaced to <i>ohel</i> (tent).</i> It is like <i>and they came into the tent</i> (Ex. 18:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The reference being to Moses’ tent.</i>
[NOW MOSES USED TO TAKE THE TENT AND PITCH IT WITHOUT THE CAMP, AFAR OFF FROM THE CAMP; AND HE CALLED IT THE TENT OF MEETING.] Look. Moses was separated from Israel because of the Glory that used to speak with him. This took place after he brought down the inscribed second tablets<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 34.</i> and Israel began to construct the tabernacle. Moses called his tent the tent of meeting because God met with him there until the tabernacle was erected. There is no chronological order in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For what is recorded in our verse did not occur at this point in time. As I.E. explains, it occurred later.</i> Some say that <i>the tent</i> refers to the tabernacle and that Scripture tells us where the tabernacle was located during the fifty days before the banners were set up.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The tabernacle was set up on the first of Nisan (Ex. 40:17). Israel journeyed according to their banners on the twentieth of Iyyar, 50 days later. I.E. assumes that Israel took their journey on the very day that the banners were set up.</i>

Verse 8



Verse 9

AND IT CAME TO PASS. This<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Like the shining of Moses’ skin. See Ex. 34:34.</i> too was a sign.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Of Moses’ closeness to God (Weiser).</i> Israel saw that as soon as Moses came to the tent from the camp of the Israelites he immediately saw the pillar of cloud.

Verse 10

AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE SAW. This took place after what is reported in the section beginning with the words, <i>See, Thou sayest unto me</i> (v. 12), for what is recorded in the latter chapter occurred during the forty days that Moses fell before the Lord concerning the incident of the calf. After this, Moses descended and hewed out the stones. God then passed by Moses, and this led to the fulfillment of God’s word, <i>and thou shalt see My back</i> (v. 23).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">It was only after this that God spoke to Moses face to face (see I.E. on verse 21). Hence what is recorded here had to have happened later on.</i>

Verse 11

AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES FACE TO FACE. I will explain this in a section that will soon follow.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E.’s comments on verse 21.</i>
BUT HIS MINISTER JOSHUA, THE SON OF NUN, A YOUNG MAN. Joshua lived a hundred and ten years.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 24:29.</i> Our sages said that Joshua spent seven years conquering Canaan and seven years dividing it up.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevachim</i> 118b.</i> If this is the case, then Joshua was now fifty-six years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua lived 110 years. We deduct from this the 40 years of wandering in the desert, and the 14 years of conquering and dividing Canaan; 110 minus 54 = 56. Hence Joshua was 56 when Israel left Egypt.</i> Why then did Scripture call him a young man? This is its grammatical explanation. His minister Joshua, the son of Nun, performed the service of a young man.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word <i>sherut</i> is to be inserted before the word <i>na’ar</i>.</i>

Verse 12

AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: SEE, THOU SAYEST UNTO ME. <i>See</i> means see the predicament in which I find myself.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the word see cannot be taken to pertain to the words that follow, for words cannot be seen. Hence I.E. interprets see to mean see my predicament.</i> I will now grammatically explain the section.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 12-23.</i>
[I KNOW THEE.] Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that <i>yedatikha</i> (I know thee) means I have honored thee. However, this is incorrect, for <i>that I may know Thee</i> (v. 13) just as You know me follows.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of <i>show me</i> (hodi’eni) <i>thy ways, that I may know Thee</i> (ve-eda’akah) (v. 13). Now <i>ve-eda’akah</i> in verse 13 cannot mean I will respect, for <i>hodi’eni</i> and <i>ve-eda’akah</i> come from the same root. Hence if <i>ve-eda’akah</i> means I will honor Thee, then <i>hodi’eni</i> must mean honor me. If this is the case, then verse 13 reads, honor me with Your ways so that I may honor You. This makes no sense. Hence we must translate <i>ve-eda’akah</i> as: that I will know Thee. Now if <i>ve-eda’akah</i> means that I will know thee, then <i>yedatikha</i>, which precedes it, must be rendered I know Thee.</i> 

Verse 13



Verse 14

[MY PRESENCE.] Saadiah Gaon says that the meaning of the word <i>panai</i> (my presence)<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, My face.</i> means my anger, as in <i>u-fanehah lo hayu lah od</i> (and her countenance was no more sad) (I Sam. 1:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Which Saadiah Gaon renders: and she was no longer angry.</i> Now, what will the Gaon do with the word <i>panekha</i> (thy presence) in <i>If Thy presence go not with me</i> (v. 15)?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">We cannot render <i>panekha</i> (thy presence) in this verse as anger because then the verse would read, <i>If Thy anger go not with me, carry us not up hence</i>.</i> I believe that <i>panai</i> means I, myself. It is similar to the word <i>panekha</i> (thine own person) in <i>and that thou go to battle in thine own person</i> (panekha) (II Sam. 17:11).

Verse 15



Verse 16

SO THAT WE ARE DISTINGUISHED. <i>Ve-niflinu</i> (so that we are distinguished) comes from the same root as <i>ve-hiflah</i> (shall make a division) in <i>And the Lord shall make a division</i> (Ex. 9:4). It belongs to those roots which end in a <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Its root is <i>peh, lamed, heh</i>.</i>

Verse 17



Verse 18

THY GLORY. Your very self, for Scripture explicitly states, <i>And it shall come to pass, while My glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by</i> (v. 22).

Verse 19

AND WILL PROCLAIM THE NAME OF THE LORD. Scripture writes with regard to Abraham, <i>and</i> (he) <i>called upon the name</i> (be-shem) <i>of the Lord</i> (Gen. 12:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>va-yikra, be-shem Adonai</i>.</i> People were the ones who were called upon to serve the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 12:8 should be understood as follows: Abraham called to people in the Lord’s name; i.e., Abraham called upon people to worship the Lord.</i> The word <i>be-shem</i> (upon the name) is therefore connected<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">By the cantillical notes.</i> to God’s glorious name. However, this is not the case with <i>and proclaimed the name of the Lord</i> (Ex. 34:5),<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>va-yikra ve-shem, Adonai</i>. Here the word <i>ve-shem</i> (the name) is not connected by a cantillical note to <i>Adonai</i> (the Lord). In fact, the cantillical notes connect it to <i>va-yikra</i>.</i> for here the Lord is the one who calls.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 34:5 should be understood as, And the Lord proclaimed the name of the Lord.</i> It is the same case with <i>and will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is, I the Lord will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, for here too <i>ve-shem</i> is connected to <i>Adonai</i>.</i>

Verse 21

AND THOU SHALT STAND UPON THE ROCK. The reference is to the top of the mountain,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The rock</i> refers to the top of the mountain.</i> for Scripture clearly states, <i>and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount</i> (Ex. 34:2). God told Moses to stand there and God himself would place him in a cleft of the rock when the Lord’s glory passed by (v. 22). For Scripture clearly states, <i>that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock</i> (v. 22). Scripture does not say that Moses should place himself in a cleft of the rock. I will now explain the meaning of the portion. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that God told Moses:<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1.</i> Bring up this people from this place wherein they sinned and I will forgive them<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Their sin of making the calf.</i> in another place.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah Gaon’s paraphrase of verse 1.</i> Moses replied: If your anger is not removed from Israel in this place then carry us not up hence.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> However, the following appears to me to be the correct interpretation of the chapter. God told Moses, <i>and I will send an angel before thee</i> (v. 2).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">That is, God told Moses to bring the people to the land of Canaan (v. 1). He then added, <i>and I will send an angel before thee</i>.</i> Moses then responded, <i>and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me</i> (v. 12), that is, whether this angel is the one concerning whom Scripture writes, <i>for My name is in him</i> (Ex. 23:21). God answered Moses, <i>My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest</i> (v. 14). The meaning of <i>thee</i> is: because I will go only with thee, but I will not rest in the midst of the children of Israel. Moses therefore responded, <i>if Thy presence go not up with</i> this nation, mentioned earlier by Moses in <i>that this nation is Thy people</i> (v. 13), [<i>carry us not up hence</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">That is, <i>If Thy presence go not up</i> (v. 15) is to be interpreted: If thy presence go not up with this nation.</i> Hence Moses employed the plural <i>al ta’alenu</i> (carry us not up).<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Because the reference is to Moses and the people.</i> <i>For wherein now shall it be known that I have found grace in Thy sight…is it not in that Thou goest with us</i> (v. 16) is positive proof that this explanation<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Moses requested that God’s presence should accompany Israel.</i> is correct. God then answered Moses, <i>I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, for thou hast found grace in My sight</i> (v. 17). Moses was extremely happy to hear this and therefore said, <i>let the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us</i> (Ex. 34:9). The latter stands in marked contrast to <i>for I will not go up in the midst of thee</i> (v. 3). Moses desired to see the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> God answered him, <i>for man shall not see Me and live</i> (v. 20). This is the truth. For the senses only feel that which is transient. Therefore <i>and they saw the God of Israel</i> (Ex. 24:10), <i>I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne</i> (Is. 6:1), and the prophecies of Ezekiel<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel saw God sitting on a throne which was placed on a platform borne by four creatures, each of which had four faces. See chapters 1 and 10 of Ezekiel.</i> were all visions of God. Look, Scripture here states, <i>and thou shalt see My back</i>. It states elsewhere, <i>and the similitude of the Lord doth he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Moses.</i> <i>behold</i> (Num. 12:8). These things require a long explanation. Saadiah Gaon says that face<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>My face shall not be seen</i> (v. 24).</i> refers to the face of the light. Let the face of the sun serve as an example.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">A person cannot look at the face of the sun. Similarly, a person cannot look at the light emanating from God. The aforementioned is referred to as God’s face.</i> The back<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">God’s back. See verse 33.</i> refers to the remaining light that cleaves to a person.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to the back of the divine light, which a person is able to behold (Weiser). See Saadiah Gaon’s <i>Book Of Beliefs And Opinions</i>, 2:11: “God has a special light which He creates and makes manifest to His prophets in order that they may infer therefrom that it is a prophetic communication emanating from God that they hear. When one of them sees this light, he says: “I have seen the glory of the Lord…” However, when they beheld this light, they were unable to look upon it because of its power and brilliance. Indeed, whoever looked upon it incurred the disintegration of his entire makeup and the flight of his spirit from his body.<br>Moses accordingly asked his Master to give him the strength to look upon this light. The latter, however, answered him that the first rays of this light were so powerful that he would be unable to view them clearly with his naked eyes, lest he perish. He would rather cover him up with a cloud or the like until the first rays of this light had passed, because the greatest strength of every radiant body is contained in its initial approach. All of this was implied in the statement of Scripture: <i>And I…will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by</i>. Then when, the first portion of the light had passed, God removed from Moses the thing that had covered him, so that he might be able to look at the back of the light, as Scripture says: <i>And I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back”</i> (Saadiah Gaon, <i>The Book Of Beliefs And Opinion</i>. Translated by Samuel Rosenblatt, Yale University Press, 1948, p. 130).</i> There is no need for all of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah’s interpretation of God’s face and back is wrong.</i> However, before I explain this let me say the following: Know that God only spoke to Moses face to face from the third series of forty days<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses spent in prayer following Israel’s making of the golden calf. See Deut. 10:10.</i> onward. Moses’ face shone because God passed by his face. Moses’ prophecy at first was through the angel who appeared in the bush.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 3:2.</i> Scripture there states, <i>And the Lord said</i> (Ex. 3:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it wasn’t actually the Lord.</i> The same is true of <i>And the Lord went before them</i> (Ex. 13:21),<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the reference is to the angel of the Lord.</i> for the messenger speaks in place of the one who sent him.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">The angel represents the Lord and delivers His message. Hence God’s angel is referred to as the Lord in Scripture.</i> The day that Moses saw what he requested was, to him, what the day of the giving of the Torah was to Israel. No human being who lived before or after Moses ever reached Moses’ status. Our sages said that God showed Moses the knot of the <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The knot of God’s <i>tefillin</i>. According to the rabbis, <i>My back</i> is to be interpreted as: what is in back of Me. See <i>Berakhot</i> 7a. Also see Rashi. For God wearing <i>tefillin</i>, see <i>Berakhot</i> 6a.</i> There words are correct. However, its meaning is not in accordance with that of the wise men of this generation who interpret the Rabbinical statement literally. On the contrary, it has a deeply hidden secret meaning.

Hence they cannot benefit or harm. Thus they cannot help one who bows down to them, for what was decreed for him in accordance with the arrangements of the stars at the time of his birth shall befall him. He can only be saved from his fate if he cleaves to and is protected by a power that is higher and more powerful than the stars. I will explain with a worthy parable. The arrangement of the stars had it that a river would overpower a city and kill or flood its inhabitants. A prophet came and warned the people to turn to God before the arrival of the day of their calamity. The people turned to God with all their heart. Because the people cleaved unto God, God put it into their hearts to go out of the city to pray unto the Lord. They did this. On the appointed day the river suddenly overflowed, as is its nature. We have witnessed this many times. The river flooded the entire city. Now God’s decree was not altered and He saved them. Imagine the following: The seven moving stars are like horses that run along a path. They do not run with the intention of doing good or bad. They act in accordance with their nature. Now imagine that a blind man is in their path. The blind man does not know how the horses act. He does not know when they go to the right and when they go to the left. The blind man depends on a person with sight who knows the way the horses run. Now the person with sight will guard the blind man. When the horses run to one side he will lead the blind person to the other side. The course of the horse’s running does not change but the blind man is saved. It is because of this that Scripture states, [<i>the sun, and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven…</i>] <i>which the Lord thy God hath allotted</i> [<i>unto all the peoples under the whole heaven</i>] (Deut. 4:19); <i>But you hath the Lord taken…to be unto Him a people of inheritance</i> (Deut. 4:20). <i>The portion of Jacob is not like these, For He is the former of all things</i> (Jer. 51:19). This is the meaning of <i>so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people</i> (v. 16). This is what the rabbis mean by “Israel has no constellation”<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sabbath</i> 156a; <i>Nedarim</i> 32a.</i> as long as they keep the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">“As long as they keep the Torah,” is not part of the Rabbinic statement.

Now the stars were arranged in a conjunction which decreed that Israel should remain in exile in Egypt for many more years.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Than they actually were.</i> God delivered them because they cried out unto the Lord and turned to Him (Ex. 2:23).

Moses spent 40 days on the mountain when he received the second pair of tablets (v. 28). There are 120 days between the sixth of Sivan, when the revelation occurred, and the Day of Atonement, when Moses brought down the second pair of tablets.

LONG-SUFFERING. <i>Erekh appayim</i> (long-suffering) is the sixth attribute.

FORGIVING INIQUITY. Pay attention to what I am about to say.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is going to point out that a word or a phrase may have more than one meaning. He does this because God is described in our verse as a <i>nose avon</i> (forgiving iniquity). However, Scripture often refers to sinners as being <i>nose avon</i> (bearing iniquity) (Lev. 5:1). I.E. thus points out that the same term may have two meanings.</i> Look. Scripture writes, <i>be thou strong therefore, and be to a man</i><sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">That is, be a man. Hebrew, <i>ve-hayita le-ish</i>.</i> (I Kings 2:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.

Its meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>ve-hayita le-ish</i>.</i> can only be, be a famous man of valor. However, Scripture writes, <i>for I</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Naomi.</i> <i>am too old to be to a man</i><sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>mi-heyot le-ish</i>.</i> (Ruth 1:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> Its meaning is, I am too old to be sexually approached by a man,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>be’ulah</i>. So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. Some printed editions read, <i>ba-olam</i> (in the world). This reading is incomprehensible.</i> or, I am too old to be a woman to a man, for the speaker<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Naomi.</i> was a female.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the terms “to be to a man” (<i>ve-hayita le-ish</i>, or, <i>mi-heyot le-ish</i>) can mean, be a famous man or to be sexually approached by a man. We thus see that the same term can have two meanings.</i> Behold. <i>That I</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob.</i><i>may come</i><sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>va-avo’ah</i>.</i> <i>into her</i><sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Rachel.</i> (Gen 34:21)<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> refers to sexual intercourse, for Rachel was a female.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">When Scripture uses the term “coming” with regard to a man coming to a woman, it means to have intercourse.</i> However, <i>that came</i><sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>ba’u</i>.</i> <i>in to thee this night</i><sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">This was addressed to Lot by the men of Sodom.</i> (Gen. 19:5) does not have the same meaning, for Lot was a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the phrase “come into” may mean to enter a person’s property or to have intercourse with.</i> Now Scripture tells us that one who sins shall bear his iniquity (<i>ve-nasa avono</i>) (Lev. 5:1); that is, his sin shall not be forgiven except by the punishment which shall befall him. <i>Ve-nasa</i> (shall bear)<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">In Lev. 5:1.</i> has the same meaning as <i>tissa</i> (shalt bear it) in <i>And if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it</i> (Prov. 9:12). However, Pharaoh said, <i>Now therefore forgive</i> (sa),<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sa</i> and <i>nasa</i> come from the same root, <i>nun, sin, alef</i>.</i> <i>I pray thee, my sin only this once</i> (Ex. 10:17), because Moses was a righteous person.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">And would not bear a grudge. The point is <i>sa na chatati</i> does not mean bear my sin. It means forgive my sin. We thus see that <i>nasa</i> means both to bear and to forgive.</i> The general rule is that Scripture is always expressing approbation when it tells us that someone bears his own sin. The term <i>nasa</i> is used in two ways in reference to sin. One, God will forgive the sinner. In this case it is for the benefit of the one whose sin is forgiven.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Thus <i>nose avon</i> (forgiving iniquity) in our verse has a positive connotation.</i> The second way in which this verb is used is to inform us that some evil person shall bear his sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">This is the sense in which this term is used in Lev. 5:1.</i> Now this term<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nose avon</i>.</i> has a negative connotation for the one who must bear his sin, but it has a positive connotation for the one whose sin is forgiven, as in <i>then he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">The husband who forces his wife to violate her oath.</i> <i>shall bear</i> (ve-nasa) <i>her iniquity</i> (Num. 30:16), for the sin will be removed from her<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">The wife.</i> and be upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The husband.</i>
FORGIVING…TRANSGRESSION. Note that <i>pesha</i> (transgression) is a more serious violation than <i>avon</i> (iniquity), for the transgressor removes himself, as it were, from the authority of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">The transgressor revolts against God.</i> Compare, <i>tifsha</i> (revolted)<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tifsha</i> comes from the same root as <i>pesha</i>.</i> in <i>then Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah</i> (II Kings 8:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">There is a slight error in the quotation.

[SIN.] The word <i>chatta’ah</i> means sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The usual word for sin in Hebrew is <i>chattat</i>.

Verse 8

AND MOSES MADE HASTE. Those whose heads are empty say that when God said, <i>and unto the fourth generation</i> (v. 7) Moses hastened<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">And <i>worshipped</i>.</i> lest the Lord add, and unto the fifth generation.

Furthermore, <i>va-yikkod</i> has the same vocalization as <i>va-yittom</i>.</i> in <i>and when the money was all spent</i> (Gen. 47:15). Similarly <i>va-yikkedu</i> (then they bowed their heads) (Ex. 4:31) is similar to <i>va-yittemu</i> (were ended) (Deut. 34:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">See note 137.</i> Pay no heed to those who add roots because of a word’s form.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Va-yikkod</i> is vocalized like a word whose first letter is a <i>nun</i>.

Some commentators therefore concluded that <i>va-yikkod</i> comes from a root beginning with a <i>nun</i>; i.e., <i>va-yikkod</i> comes from the root <i>nun, kof, dalet</i> and <i>yiddemu</i> from the root <i>nun, dalet, mem</i>. Hence I.E.’s comment.

Verse 10

AND HE SAID: BEHOLD, I MAKE A COVENANT. This is what <i>for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</i> (v. 27) refers to. The reference is to the conditions starting from <i>Observe thou</i> (v. 11). It is because of this<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">The commandments stated in this chapter verses 11-26.</i> that I will write a second pair of tablets. The latter shall serve as a document of witness. All of this, namely, that I have forgiven their sin, was because of your honor. I will therefore do marvels for you so that all who see you will marvel, and know that I have placed My glory upon you. The aforementioned is something that I have not wrought since the day that I created heaven and earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s explanation of <i>before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation</i>.</i> The reference is to the shining of Moses’ face. Observe. Scripture writes that at the time of Moses’ death, unlike the nature of all old people, <i>his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated</i> (Deut. 34:7).
[SUCH AS HAVE NOT BEEN WROUGHT IN ALL THE EARTH, NOR IN ANY NATION.] Its meaning is, such a thing has been unheard of among the nations. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon explains it as follows: such a thing has not been wrought in the land of Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Saadiah understand <i>ha-aretz</i> (the earth) to mean the land.

Verse 11

OBSERVE THOU.

They did not add or diminish anything from God’s dictum. See I.E. on Ps. 99:7.</i> and to then relate them to the children of Israel. <i>Shemor</i> (observe) is to be taken in the sense of <i>shameru</i> (kept) in <i>They</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Moses and Aaron.

He similarly related the contents of Ex. 34:11-26 to Israel after bringing down the second pair of tablets. See I.E.’s comments on verses 26 and 27 and the notes thereto.</i>
[I AM DRIVING OUT.] The word <i>goresh</i> (I am driving out) is a transitive verb in the <i>kal</i>. It is the same case with the word <i>gerushah</i> (one divorced) in <i>A widow, or one divorced</i> (Lev. 21:14).

Verse 12

TAKE HEED TO THYSELF. This verse is similar to <i>Thou shalt not bow down to their gods</i> (Ex. 23:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">See note 163.</i>

[MOLTEN GODS.] The phrase “the gods of the nations” takes in all idol worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 23:33 reads, <i>Thou shalt not make a covenant with them nor with their gods</i>. Scripture thus prohibits worshipping the gods of the nations. Now the term gods includes all gods.

The feast of unleavened bread serves as a memorial, for Scripture states, <i>for in it thou camest out from Egypt</i> (Ex. 23:15). It is because of this that Scripture mentions the law dealing with the firstling of an ass (v. 20), which is also in memory of the Exodus from Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">However, it does not mention it in chapter 23.

It similarly mentions the laws pertaining to the harvest in the Torah portion <i>Kedoshim Teheyu</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19:9.</i> It is because Passover recalls the Exodus that Scripture mentions, <i>All that openeth the womb is Mine</i> (v. 19).<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">This too recalls the Exodus.</i> 

Verse 19

[THY CATTLE.] The word <i>miknekha</i> (thy cattle) is a feminine here.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the word <i>tizachar</i> (thou shalt sanctify as males) which governs <i>miknekha</i> is a feminine. (I.E. interprets <i>tizachar</i> as meaning, its males shall be sanctified). Hence <i>miknekha</i> must be a feminine. However, elsewhere <i>miknekha</i> is a masculine. Compare <i>mikneh rav</i> (a great multitude of cattle).</i> There are many other nouns that are both masculine and feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 49:20.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

SIX DAYS THOU SHALT WORK. Scripture earlier reads similarly.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 23:12.</i>
[IN PLOWING TIME AND IN HARVEST THOU SHALT REST.] Scripture states, <i>in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest</i> because human life is dependent principally on these activities. Anan,<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">The founding father of the Karaites (second half of the eighth century).</i> may his name be erased like a cloud,<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>anan</i>. I.E. plays with the name Anan. Anan, may his name be erased, as an <i>anan</i> (cloud).</i> says that the reference is to sexual relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">According to Anan, <i>in plowing time…thou shalt rest</i> prohibits one from engaging in sexual intercourse on the Sabbath.</i> Will Anan not be covered with shame? We will grant that it is in the hand of man to plow (<i>charish</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">At the time of his choosing.</i> However, Anan is silent (<i>yacharish</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">He does not comment. I.E. plays with the words <i>charish</i> (plowing) and <i>yachcharish</i> (is, or will be, silent).</i> with regard to the word harvest.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">If plowing pertains to intercourse then harvesting must refer to childbirth. Now a person can refrain from intercourse on the Sabbath but he cannot prevent his wife from giving birth on the Sabbath. Hence Anan commented on “plow” but refrained from commenting on the “harvest” because it does not fit in with his interpretation.</i> 
Scripture does not mention the Sabbatical year in this section.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">As it does in Ex. 23:11.</i> What we ordinarily mean by a full day consists of the movement of the upper sphere<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">The diurnal sphere.</i> from east to west in twenty-four hours. A day of the sun<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a year. I.E. refers to a year as a day of the sun because it takes the sun a year to circle the earth. According to I.E. our verse may be interpreted to mean six sun days; i.e., six years shall you work your field but in the seventh sun year you shall rest. Our verse may thus be interpreted as referring both to the Sabbath and to the Sabbatical year (Krinsky).</i> consists of three hundred and sixty-five days and about a quarter of a day, for this is how long it takes the sun to make a circuit from its point of departure in the west until it returns to its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Of departure. That is, it takes the sun a year to circle the heavens.</i> Those who know the science of the constellations will understand this.

Verse 22

AND THE FEAST OF INGATHERING. Scripture states this<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">The Feast of Ingathering.</i> in two places.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Here and in Ex. 23:16.</i> Scripture there reads, <i>at the end of the year</i> (Ex. 23:16) because the end of the year is the beginning of the next year.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Scripture reads, <i>at the end of the year</i> even though the Feast of Ingathering (Sukkot) falls on the 15th day of the first month of the new year, because the end of the year is the beginning of the next year.</i> This is the proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">For another interpretation, see Meijler.</i> The sun enters the constellation of Libra<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">The constellation of Tishri.</i> close to the tenth day.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Of Tishri.</i> The new year never occurs after the end of the festival of Sukkot. Scripture therefore reads, <i>at the turn of the year</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the new year is calculated from the first day of Tishri, it really begins at the start of fall.</i> Do not rely on Samuel’s circuits.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">In calculating the year, according to Samuel, it takes the sun exactly 365 and a quarter of a day (6 hours) to complete its annual circuit. See I.E. on Ex. 12:1 and the notes thereto.</i> Only rely on Rav Ada’s circuit<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rav Ada it takes the sun 365 days, five hours, 55 minutes, and 25 seconds to complete its annual circuit.</i> even though it requires two adjustments. One, because the sun at times travels in a longer circuit and at times it travels in a shorter circuit. This difference is not in the sun’s movement, for the sun always travels in a consistent course. Its speed only appears to vary when viewed against a point in the sphere of the constellations.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">The point in the sky where the sun appears at the start of each of the four seasons (Krinsky).</i> A second adjustment has to be made because of the movement of the epicycle at the head of Aries.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">The sun was believed to move in an epicycle when at the head of Aries. This slows down its annual cycle.</i>

Verse 23

THREE TIMES IN THE YEAR. Scripture mentions the God of Israel in this section<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">In Ex. 23:17 the same law appears. However, there God is referred to as <i>the Lord God</i>. He is not called <i>the Lord God, the God of Israel</i> as here.</i> because of the incident of the golden calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">The worshippers of the calf said, <i>This is thy god, O Israel</i> (Ex. 32:4). Hence Scripture here emphasizes that it is the Lord who is God of Israel.</i>

Verse 24

FOR I WILL CAST OUT. Scripture explains in this chapter what it does not mention in the earlier one,<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture here explains why Israel will have no reason for trepidation when they go on their pilgrimages. It does not mention this in chapter 23.</i> for there was no need to mention it in the earlier chapter.<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">For the earlier chapter was stated before Israel made the golden calf (Krinsky).</i> Now since God commanded<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 23.</i> all male Israelites to see His face,<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Three times a year.</i> and all of Israel is doing His will, the Lord will undoubtedly guard their land from their enemies. Scripture explains this point very clearly.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 24.</i>
[NEITHER SHALL ANY MAN COVET THY LAND.] I will make your neighbors so fearful that they will not even covet your land.<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Neither shall any man covet thy land</i> might be taken to mean that the Land of Israel is not a very desirable land. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> They certainly will not think of waging war.

Verse 25



Verse 26

THE CHOICEST FIRST-FRUITS OF THY LAND. Scripture reads similarly in the earlier chapter.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 23:19.</i> These are the conditions.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">These (vs. 11-26) are the conditions which Israel must accept if God is to renew His covenant with Israel.</i> From <i>Now these are the ordinances</i> (Ex. 21:1) until <i>And six years</i> (Ex. 23:10) consists of ordinances. The high priest and the judge, namely, the king, are obligated to study them and know them.<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">There was thus no reason to repeat them here.</i> The obligations of the congregation, which are the same as those noted here,<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">In our chapter, verses 11-26.</i> are then mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">In Ex. 23:12-33.</i>

Verse 27

AND THE LORD SAID. Even though these things were already written,<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>.</i> Moses wrote them again with the Decalogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Before getting the second pair of tablets. “The matter of the second of the second Tablets was like that of the first in every respect,” Nahmanides on verse 28, Chavel translation.</i> This section was therefore written twice.

Verse 28

AND HE WAS THERE. Many think that Moses spent eighty days on the mountain until God gave him the tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Forty days for the first tablets and 40 days in prayer (Deut. 9:18), which culminated with the giving of the second tablets (Krinsky). It should be noted that while I.E. rejects this opinion here, he appears to accept it in Deut. 10:1 (Sarim).</i> They are mistaken. On the contrary, the words of our ancient sages<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">According to the sages of the Talmud, Moses spent 120 days on Sinai. See <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 47:12.</i> are, as I have already noted, correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Ex. 33:10.</i> Look, Moses spent forty days on the mountain until God gave him the first tablets. Scripture clearly states, <i>and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights</i> (Ex. 24:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated with regard to the first tablets.</i> Moses himself similarly states, <i>So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights</i> (Deut. 9:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">In prayer on behalf of Israel. The rabbis assume that this took place on mount Sinai, for Scripture states <i>before the Lord</i>.</i> Moses then<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">At the end of the 40 days of prayer.</i> said everything that is recorded in the section starting with the words <i>See Thou sayest unto me</i> (Ex. 33:12). Moses then descended and hewed the tablets and personally brought them up to Mount Sinai. Observe, Scripture states, <i>And the Lord passed by before him</i> (v. 6), and later goes on to say, <i>And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water</i>. As was his practice the first time, so was his practice the second time.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">As Moses spent 40 days on Sinai the first time, so did he spend 40 days the second time. Moses thus spent 120 days on Sinai, 80 days when receiving the tablets and 40 in prayer.</i>
AND HE WROTE UPON THE TABLES. God wrote upon the tablets,<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">According to I.E. the subject of <i>va-yikhtov</i> (and He wrote) is God.</i> for Scripture explicitly states, <i>and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou didst break</i> (v. 1).

Verse 29

THAT MOSES KNEW NOT THAT THE SKIN OF HIS FACE SENT FORTH BEAMS WHILE HE TALKED WITH HIM. The meaning of <i>while He talked with him</i> is, while God talked with him. This occurred because the glory<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">God’s glory.</i> was seen upon Moses’ face. Moses’ face therefore shone like the brightness of the firmament.
[SENT FORTH BEAMS.] The word <i>karan</i> (sent forth beams) is related to the word <i>karnayim</i> (rays) in <i>Rays hath He at His side</i> (Hab. 3:4),<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Keren</i> means a horn. Hence the word <i>karan</i>. Literally, it means horned. I.E. therefore explains that <i>karan</i> should be understood as sent forth beams.</i> for the opening part of the verse explicitly states, <i>And a brightness appeareth as the light</i>. Now since <i>Rays hath He at His side</i> follows,<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">That is, since <i>Rays hath He at His side</i> follows <i>And a brightness appeareth as the light</i>.</i> our verse repeats the same idea in different words<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">This is known as parallelism. The point is <i>karnayim</i> (rays) <i>hath He at His side</i> means the same as <i>And a brightness appeareth as the light</i>. Hence <i>karnayim</i> means rays; similarly the word <i>karan</i> in our verse, which is etymologically related to it, means rays.</i> as is the custom of Scripture. May the bones of Chivi the transgressor<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">For Chivi see I.E. on Ex. 14:23 and the notes thereto.</i> be crushed, for Chivi said that Moses’ face turned dry as a horn<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Chivi interprets <i>karan or panav</i> (the skin of his face sent forth horns) as the skin of his face horned, i.e. turned hard as a horn.</i> because he did not eat bread. Chivi similarly explains, <i>and they were afraid</i> (v. 30) as meaning they were afraid because Moses’ face was ugly. Now why did this cursed wretch not open his eyes. A person will only fear to approach someone because there is something strange in him which he has never ever seen before.<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">People are used to seeing ugly people. Hence there was no reason why the Israelites should have feared to approach Moses.</i> There is no person who has never looked upon the face of a corpse that does not fear to approach a dead body. Furthermore, if this is the case,<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">That the people feared to approach Moses because of his ugliness.</i> why was the veil not always upon the face of Moses? Why did Moses always remove the veil (v. 33) when he spoke with Israel? Did Chivi not see that when Moses was one hundred and twenty years old (Deut. 34:7) <i>his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated</i>? This was most certainly so<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses’ face was fresh and youthful rather than dry as a horn as Chivi maintains.</i> when Moses was eighty years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was 80 years old at the time of the Exodus. See Ex. 7:7.</i>

Verse 30

AND WHEN AARON. Who was first in rank.
AND ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The reference is to the leaders with whom it was the practice of Moses to speak. Scripture similarly states, <i>And Moses called unto them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Aaron and the rulers.</i> (v. 31).

Verse 31

RETURNED UNTO HIM. This shows that they turned away from Moses after they went out to meet him because they were greatly frightened.

Verse 32

AND AFTERWARD. Afterward all the children of Israel who stood at the foot of the mount came near.
AND HE GAVE THEM IN COMMANDMENT. All of the conditions already mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 11-26.</i>

Verse 33

A VEIL. <i>Masveh</i> (veil) is a garment (<i>kesut</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">It is a garment which covers the face (Krinsky). According to I.E., <i>masveh</i> and <i>kesut</i> come from the same root (<i>samekh, vav, heh</i>) and have the same meaning.</i> Some say that the word <i>suto</i> (vesture) in <i>And his vesture in the blood of grapes</i> (Gen. 49: 11)<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">See I.E. on Gen. 49:11 and the notes thereto.</i> is similar. Do not be amazed that the <i>vav</i> in <i>masveah</i> is enunciated while the <i>vav</i> is <i>suto</i> is silent, for we find the same with the words <i>avlatah</i> (wickedness) (Hos. 10:13) and <i>olatah</i> (iniquity) (Job 5:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">They come from the same root.</i> We similarly find <i>ul yamim</i> (an infant of days) (Is. 65:20) and <i>avilim</i> (urchins) (Job. 19:18);<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ul</i> and <i>avilim</i> come from the same root. However, the <i>vav</i> is not sounded in <i>ul</i>.</i> <i>el tokh ha-machneh</i> (within the camp) (Deut. 23:11) and also <i>va-yevatter otam ba-tavekh</i> (and divided them in the midst) (Gen. 15:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tokh</i> and <i>tavekh</i> come from the same root. However, the <i>vav</i> is silent in <i>tokh</i>. Similarly <i>masveh</i> and <i>suto</i>.</i> Some say that the light was renewed upon Moses’ face every time Moses came to the tent of meeting and spoke with God. When Moses left the tent the light remained<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Upon Moses’ face.</i> as long as he related God’s words to the children of Israel. When Moses finished speaking he put on the veil, for he knew that the light would depart and his face would return to its prior state. It would be an insult to Moses if the Israelites saw his face without light radiating from it. Moses therefore put on the veil. However, when he came in to speak with God he would remove<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. However, some of the printed editions have “he would put.” This appears to be an error. See Netter and Weiser.</i> the veil to receive the light. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that the light was not removed from Moses’ face until the day of his death. Therefore Moses’ eye was not dimmed.<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">When he reached the age of 120. See Deut. 34:7.</i> This is correct. However, Saadiah says that Moses put on the veil so that the Israelites would not be afraid when they quarreled with each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">That is, when they had a dispute and came to Moses for judgment, for the light on Moses’ face would prevent them from presenting their case freely (Weiser).</i> However, I believe that Moses put on a veil out of respect to the light which God newly created upon his face. He did not want Israel to constantly see it. He wanted them to see it only when he spoke God’s words. He removed the veil when he came into the tent of meeting to speak with God face to face. This is the meaning of <i>But when Moses went in</i>, etc. (v. 34).

Verse 34



Verse 35

AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SAW THE FACE OF MOSES, THAT THE SKIN OF MOSES’ FACE SENT FORTH BEAMS. Observe. The meaning of <i>and Moses put the veil back upon his face</i><sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>ve-heshiv</i> is not to be taken as a perfect but as an imperfect.</i> is that Moses always acted in this manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture is not describing something that happened once but something which Moses continually practiced.</i> This was his practice in dealing with the Israelites until the day that God’s glory gathered him to Himself.

Chapter 35



Verse 1

Blessed is the most high God Who led his people with might; Through his messenger Whose face shined as the light of the sun. He commanded Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38. The printed texts say, for commanding him.</i> on the mountain To prepare a tent for his dwelling, as stated in The Torah portion <i>Va-Yakhel</i>.
AND MOSES ASSEMBLED. <i>Moses assembled</i> the people so that all of them would hear, from him, the report about the tabernacle and would donate to its construction.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.E comments thus because Moses did not gather all the people together to hear the other commandments.</i> <i>Elleh ha-devarim</i> (these are the words) is to be interpreted as referring to the making of the tabernacle and its vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our verse states, <i>These are the words</i> (elleh ha-devarim) <i>which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do</i> (la’asot) <i>them</i>. Now one cannot “do” words. Hence I.E. interprets <i>devarim</i> as things. He explains the verse as follows: These are the things which the Lord hath commanded that you make. So Sarim. However, Krinsky claims that I.E. explains our verse as meaning: These are the words regarding the construction of the tabernacle and its vessels which the Lord hath commanded that you make. According to this interpretation the word <i>devarim</i> means words as it usually does.</i> Scripture therefore reads, <i>that ye should do them</i>. This is its meaning:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Of verses 2 and 3.</i> God commanded me that you make what I will tell you.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 2.</i> Now even though you are obligated to do heaven’s work, the Lord commanded you to be careful and not do any work on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> One who violates this law before witnesses will be put to death by a court of law.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.E.’s paraphrase of the last part of verse 3.</i> Scripture explains elsewhere<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In Num. 15:35.</i> that he will be stoned.

Verse 2



Verse 3

YE SHALL KINDLE NO FIRE. Since Scripture earlier mentioned with regard to the first and the seventh day of the festival of unleavened bread, <i>no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat</i> (Ex. 12:16), namely, that it is permitted to prepare food<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is permitted to do the work necessary for the preparation of food.</i> on these days, it now states with regard to the Sabbath, <i>ye shall kindle no fire</i> to bake bread or to cook meat, for fire is required in preparing all food. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon composed a very important work refuting those who dispute with the ancients regarding the Sabbath lights.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Karaites, who prohibit a candle that is lit before the onset of the Sabbath from continuing to burn on the Sabbath.</i>

Verse 4

AND MOSES SPOKE. Moses now began to explain to the entire congregation what God had commanded him.

Verse 5

TAKE. The word <i>kechu</i> (take) is the opposite of <i>tenu</i> (give). However, when a <i>mem</i> follows a word from the root <i>lamed, kof, chet</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">As it does in our verse, for our verse reads, <i>kechu me-ittekhem</i>. Others emend to a <i>lamed</i> not a <i>mem</i>, because I Kings 17:10 reads, <i>kechu li</i>. If this is the case, then the <i>lamed</i> referred to is the <i>lamed</i> in <i>la-Adonai</i>.</i> then it has the meaning of give. The meaning of <i>kechu li</i> (take me) in <i>Take me, I pray thee, a little water</i> (I Kings 17:10)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> is, take for me,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, because the taking is for me.</i> take on my account. It is the same case with <i>Take</i> (kechu) <i>ye from among you</i> (me-ittekhem) <i>an offering unto the Lord</i> (la-Adonai).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Its meaning is, take for me an offering for the Lord.</i>
[WHOSOEVER IS OF A WILLING HEART.] The phrase <i>kol nediv libbo</i> (whosoever is of a willing heart) is irregular.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It is irregular for the following two reasons: a) <i>Nediv</i>, which is an adjective, is in the construct. An adjective does not usually come in the construct. b) <i>Libbo</i> is a declined noun. A declined noun is not usually preceded by a word in the construct (Filwarg). It should be noted that the literal meaning of <i>kol nediv libbo</i> is, whosoever willing of his heart.</i> It should be interpreted as if written <i>kol asher nedavo libbo</i> (all whose heart made them willing). We find the same with <i>bi-gedol zero’akha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bi-gedol</i> (by the greatness of), an adjective, is in the construct with <i>zero’akha</i> (Thine arm), which is a declined noun.</i> (By the greatness of Thine arm) (Ex. 15:16), which should be interpreted as if written <i>bi-zero’akha ha-gadol</i> (by Thy great arm); and <i>zekher rav tuvekha</i> (the fame of Thy great goodness)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. <i>Rav</i> (great), an adjective, is in the construct with <i>tuvekha</i> (Thy goodness), which is a declined noun.</i> (Ps. 145:7), which should be interpreted as if written <i>zekher tuvekha ha-rav</i> (the fame of goodness which is great). Rabbi Joshua says that the <i>vav</i> of <i>libbo</i> is superfluous.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, our phrase is to be read as if written, <i>kol nediv lev</i> (whosoever is of a willing heart). This only eliminates <i>libbo’s</i> irregularity. It does not explain the. irregularity of <i>nediv</i> (Filwarg).</i> It is similar to the <i>vav</i> of <i>chayeto</i> in <i>chayeto</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chayeto</i> is be interpreted as if written <i>chayyat</i>.</i> <i>sadai</i> (every beast of the field) (Ps. 104:11) and the <i>vav</i> of <i>beno</i> in <i>beno</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beno</i> is to be interpreted as if written <i>ben</i>.</i> <i>be’or</i> (Balaam the son of Beor) (Num. 24:3).
[LET HIM BRING IT.] After stating <i>let him bring it</i>, Scripture continues to explain, and goes on to say that the reference is to <i>the Lord’s offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The Lord’s offering</i> appears to be redundant. Hence I.E. notes that it is the style of Scripture to occasionally elaborate.

[AND SILVER.] Some say that the word <i>kesef</i> (silver) is etymologically related to the word <i>nikhsefah</i> (yearneth) (Ps. 94:3),<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">They both come from the root <i>kaf, samekh, peh</i>.</i> and that silver is so called because it is a delight to the eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “a delight to the eyes” is a quote from Gen. 3:6.</i> <i>Nechoshet</i> (brass) is also so called because women practice magic (<i>me-nachashot</i>) with brass (<i>nechoshet</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">They employ brass objects in their magical practices (Filwarg).</i>

Verse 6

AND SCARLET. The word <i>shani</i> (scarlet) is here spelled without a <i>mem</i>. We also find it spelled with a <i>mem</i>. Compare <i>shanim</i> (scarlet) in <i>Though your sins be as scarlet</i> (Is. 1:18). Perhaps the latter is a plural.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Hence it is spelled with a <i>mem</i>. According to this interpretation, <i>shani</i> is the singular form for scarlet and <i>shanim</i> is its plural form.</i>

Verse 7

AND SKINS. The word <i>orot</i> (skins) is masculine.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it has a feminine ending, for the word <i>or</i> (skin) is masculine.</i> <i>Luchot</i> (tables) is similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Luchot</i> is masculine even though it has a feminine ending, for the word <i>lu’ach</i> (tablet) is masculine.</i> So is <i>bechorot</i> (firstlings) in <i>and the firstlings of…thy flock</i> (Deut. 14:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bechorot</i> is masculine even though it has a feminine ending, for the word <i>bechor</i> (firstling) is masculine.</i>

Verse 8

AND OIL. Scripture does not mention pure beaten olive oil<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture reads, <i>and oil for the light</i>.

Verse 21

I.E. takes this to mean whose heart exalted him over other craftsmen. He identifies those whose heart stirred them up with the “wise-hearted” mentioned in verse 10. I.E. interprets thus because nowhere else does Scripture indicate that the “wise-hearted” actually came to make the vessels that God had commanded to be made. See Krinsky and Netter.</i>

Verse 22

MEN AND WOMEN. The meaning of <i>al nashim</i> (and women) is, with women.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>al</i> here has the meaning of with.

Verse 31

AND HE HATH FILLED HIM. Look. God bore witness that Bezalel was saturated with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, and in addition was skilled in all manner of workmanship.

Verse 32

AND TO DEVISE SKILFUL WORKS. <i>Ve-la-chashov machashavot</i> (and to devise skilful works) is to be interpreted as meaning: and to devise in his heart designs which were never seen. [IN GOLD, AND IN SILVER.] For some people are skilled in working with gold but not in working with silver. Others are skilled stone masons but are not skilled wood carvers. However, Bezalel was a master of all of these crafts. 

Verse 33



Verse 34

[AND HE HATH PUT IN HIS HEART THAT HE MAY TEACH.] In addition to the above, God put in his heart the ability to teach because there are many wise men who teach with great difficulty. Now Oholiab was Bezalel’s colleague in all the crafts and in the skill of teaching to others. Scripture therefore says with regard to both of them, <i>even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works</i><sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. assumes that as Bezalel and Oholiab were colleagues in <i>workmanship, and…skilful works</i>, so were they colleagues in the ability to teach these skills.</i> (v. 35).

Verse 1

SHALL WORK. Look. Bezalel himself shall make the glorious object.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The ark.

Verse 2

CALLED. The <i>heh</i> of the word <i>le-korvah</i> (to come) is superfluous. It is like the <i>heh</i> in the word <i>u-le-dovkah</i> (and to cleave)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Which is also superfluous.</i> in <i>and to cleave unto Him</i> (Deut. 11:22). A great scholar erred in saying that the word <i>le-omdah</i> (it might stand) (Ezek. 17:14) is similar, for the <i>heh</i> in <i>le-omdah</i> has a <i>mappik</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A dot.</i> in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i> with a <i>mappik</i> means it.</i> <i>Omed</i> is an intransitive verb.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. comments thus because an intransitive verb does not usually have a <i>heh</i> with a <i>mappik</i> suffixed to it. The <i>heh</i> with a <i>mappik</i> usually indicates the direct object.</i> The meaning of <i>le-omdah</i> (it might stand) is therefore<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>le-omdah</i> is intransitive.</i> to stand by it.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The covenant. In other words, <i>heh</i> with a <i>mappik</i> does not mean to stand it but to stand by it, for <i>omed</i> is intransitive (see note 6).

Verse 3

Verse 4

AND ALL THE WISE MEN…CAME. To Moses’ tent and said, <i>The people bring much more</i> [<i>than enough for the service of the work</i>] (v. 5). 

Verse 5

[MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH.] The <i>mem</i> of <i>mi-de</i> (much more than enough) means: much more than. It is, in keeping with my interpretation,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In Ps. 119:99.</i> like the <i>mem</i> of <i>mi-kol</i> (more than all) in <i>I have more understanding than all my teachers</i> (Ps. 119:99).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. takes issue with the Rabbinic interpretation that <i>mi-kol</i> in <i>mi-kol melammedai hiskalti</i> (I have more understanding than all my teachers) means: from all.

He who learns from all men; as it is said, From all (<i>mi-kol</i>) my teachers I have gotten understanding.” According to I.E. it means: more than all.</i>

Verse 7

Its meaning is, <i>ho-tirah</i> (and they produced more than enough).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the infinitive form <i>ve-hoter</i> is here to be interpreted as a feminine perfect, for <i>ve-hoter</i> refers to <i>melakhah</i>, which is feminine.

Verse 8

MADE. Scripture begins with the making of the tabernacle.
TWINED. <i>Moshzar</i> (twined) means long in Arabic. Note that the single digit numbers<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the ones, reading <i>ha-achadim</i> (the ones), as in <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38.

Weiser suggests that our text is defective. On the other hand, Filwarg and others interpret <i>ha-echad</i> as <i>achadim</i>.</i> are grammatically irregular in Hebrew. This is also the case in Aramaic. They are similarly irregular in Arabic. The <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a <i>heh</i> preceded by a <i>kamatz</i>.</i> at the end of a word indicates the feminine; the masculine does not have any sign.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The masculine singular does not have any sign indicating that the word is masculine.</i> Now the <i>heh</i> in the number <i>sheloshah</i> (three) indicates the masculine.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, in the single digit numbers the feminine ending indicates that the word is masculine.</i> The same is true of the numbers <i>arba’ah</i> (four), <i>shemonah</i> (eight), <i>asarah</i> (ten).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. is being brief.

Compare, <i>sheloshet ha-anashim ha-elleh</i> (these three men) (Ezek. 14:16); and <i>u-sheloshet neshe vanav</i> (and the three wives of his sons) (Gen. 7:13).

Verse 9

[CUBITS.] It is possible that the reason our verse reads <i>ba-ammah</i> (cubits)<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>kamatz</i> beneath the <i>bet</i> indicates the definite article.</i> is that it refers to a specific cubit.

In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, this alludes to Bezalel, who made all the sacred vessels. But this is not my opinion, for in the case of the court of the Tabernacle it likewise says, <i>and he made the court</i> (Ex. 38:9), [and it would not be reasonable to say that Bezalel alone made the court]. Rather, this refers back to <i>every wise-hearted man</i> (Ex. 36:8) as mentioned in the making of the Tabernacle” (Nahmanides on Ex. 36:8, Chavel translation).</i> Now Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In chapter 36.</i> mentions the tabernacle,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 36:8.</i> the tent,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ex 36:14.</i> the veil,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 36:35.</i> and the screen,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 36:37.</i> for they serve a similar purpose.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The first two served as coverings and the latter two as partitions. According to Krinsky, Sarim, and Weiser, I.E.’s point is that Scripture tells us about the making of the sanctuary’s structure before writing about the making of its furniture, because it is the way of the world to first build a house and then to put in the furniture.</i> Scripture then mentions the holy anointing oil with the incense of sweet spices<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 39.</i> because there are spices in the anointing oil and also in the sweet incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. was bothered by the juxtaposition of the anointing oil and the incense of the sweet spices.

[OF THE MIRRORS.] <i>Be-marot</i> (of the mirrors) has a <i>bet</i> rather than a <i>mem</i> prefaced to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The usual way to say “of the mirrors” is <i>mi-marot</i>, for a <i>mem</i> prefaced to a word means from or of. On the other hand, a <i>bet</i> prefaced to a word means in or with. Hence our verse should have read <i>mi-marot</i> rather than <i>be-marot</i>.</i> It is proper Hebrew to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the <i>bet</i> may be used in place of a <i>mem</i>.</i> We find the same in the verse <i>ve-ha-notar ba-basar u-va-lachem</i> (and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread) (Lev. 8:32).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Here too a <i>bet</i> is used in place of a <i>mem</i>, for we would expect <i>ve-ha-notar me-ha-basar u-me-ha-lachem</i>.</i> It is the same case in Arabic.
[THAT DID SERVICE.] Scripture states this because it is the custom of all women to beautify themselves. They look at their faces in brass or glass mirrors every morning to arrange the head coverings<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>pe’arim</i>.</i> upon their heads. These head coverings are mentioned in the Book of Isaiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 3:20 speaks of the <i>pe’arim</i> (the headtires).</i> The custom of Israel was the same as the Moslem practice unto this very day.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Moslem women in I.E.’s day placed head coverings on their heads. Hence I.E.’s comment.</i> Now there were in Israel women who served God and removed themselves from the pleasures of this world. These women gave their mirrors as a free-will offering because they had no need to beautify themselves. They rather came daily to the door of the tent of meeting to pray and to hear the words of the commandments. Scripture states, <i>that did service</i> (tzave’u)<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tzave’u</i> is in the plural.</i> at the door of the tent of meeting because there were many such women.
[THE LAVER.] Scripture does not mention the dimensions of the laver as it does in the case of the lavers that Solomon made.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Each one of the lavers made by Solomon <i>contained forty baths</i> (I Kings 7:38).</i> The laver<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in our verse.</i> was rather made out of all the mirrors that were brought.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It had no preconceived measure.

[THE BASE.] The <i>ken</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Referred to in our verse.</i> that is, the base,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Weiser renders: The <i>ken</i> (base), which is the same as the <i>mekhonah</i> (base) mentioned in I Kings 7:38, was in all instances the same size as the laver.</i> was in all instances the same size as the laver<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“By the same size” I.E. means that a larger laver had a larger base, a smaller laver had a smaller base.</i> as is normally the case.

ALL THE GOLD. Saadiah Gaon asks, “Why does Scripture note what was done with the silver but does not mention what the donated gold was used for?”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture, in verses 27 and 28, itemizes what the silver was used for.

Thus Scripture does in fact tell us what the gold was utilized for. The remaining gold was then used for various other items. See I.E.’s short commentary on this verse. We thus know what four talents of gold was used for.</i> Now this is incorrect.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">That the ark, table, and altar of incense were each made from a talent of gold.</i> Only the menorah was entirely made of gold. This was not the case with the ark. The ark was only overlaid with gold on the inside and on the outside. The same was true of the altar of incense. The table, the staves, the boards, and the bars were all overlaid with gold. The ark cover was made completely of gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">As noted in Ex. 25:17.</i> According to the tradition passed on to us by our fathers the ark cover was made from a talent of gold because it was very broad and very wide. I believe that Scripture mentions what they did with the silver because the silver was given for atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 30:15.</i> Observe. Scripture notes that the tabernacle, which included all the vessels, stood on the silver which the Israelites were obligated to give.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The silver which the Israelites were obligated to give to atone for their souls.

Hence Scripture did not itemize the amount of gold needed for each object. Nahmanides similarly comments, “Now since one cannot know exactly how much gold went into the covering of each of these vessels, Scripture did not say that Moses gave it over to them by number and weight” (Nahmanides on v. 8, Chavel translation).</i>

Verse 25

AND THE SILVER. Look. We learn from the sum mentioned in this verse that a talent consists of three thousand <i>shekalim</i>. <i>And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation</i> proves this.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Those numbered came to 603,350 (v. 26).

Thus 100 talents = 300,000 <i>shekalim</i>, which is another way of saying that one talent = 3,000 <i>shekalim</i>.</i>

According to the plain meaning of the text, the tabernacle was first erected on the first day of the first month. Observe, they raised up this first tabernacle on the first day of the first month. They began to build the first temple, which was the second tabernacle, on the second day of the second month, called Iyyar, as Scripture clearly states, <i>in the second day of the second month</i> (II Chron. 3:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">II Chron. 3:2 reads: <i>And he began to build</i> [the House of God] <i>in the second day of the second month</i>.</i> Our Talmud writes that Israel left Egypt on the fifth day of the week.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sabbath</i> 87b; <i>Seder Olam</i> 5:3.

Thus five of the princes offered their dedication sacrifices during the time of the festival seasons. Those who have this opinion believe that if the priests were occupied with the dedication sacrifices of the princes they had no time to offer the Passover sacrifices. According to Meijler this opinion holds that Scripture should have mentioned the Passover sacrifices along with the sacrifices offered by the princes on the days that coincided with Passover. This question relates only to I.E.’s point of view. According to the opinion that the “eighth day” fell on the first of Nisan, the princes finished bringing their dedication offerings on the 12th day of Nisan, three days before the start of Passover, and consequently there is no problem.</i> Israel observed the festival of Passover<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">That is, they sacrificed the paschal lamb on the 14th of Nisan and ate its flesh on the night of the 15th. It should be noted that in Scripture, Passover refers to the 14th of Nisan, when the paschal lamb is sacrificed, and the feast of unleavened bread to the seven days which follow. See note 86.</i> in the desert of Sinai for only one night.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 9:1-6. Scripture there tells us that Israel observed the Passover in the first month of the second year following the Exodus from Egypt. The feast of unleavened bread is not mentioned. It is I.E.’s contention that this is the only Passover that Israel celebrated during their sojourn in the wilderness of Sinai.</i> They did not keep the festival of unleavened bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Which begins on the eve of the 15th of Nisan and lasts for seven days. See Ex. 12:15.</i> for Scripture clearly states, <i>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee</i> [<i>into the land of the Canaanite</i>] (Ex. 13:5)…<i>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</i> (Ex. 13:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">We thus see that the obligation to observe the feast of unleavened bread begins only when Israel enters the land of Canaan.</i> <i>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial</i> (Ex. 12:14) refers to the next generation. It commands the next generation to establish the day that Israel left Egypt, as a holy convocation. Look! They journeyed from Goshen on the first day.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">That is, on the first of what would eventually be the seven days of the festival of unleavened bread, for Israel left Egypt on the 15th of Nisan. See Num. 33:3. I.E.’s point is that Israel did not observe the festival of unleavened bread till they entered Canaan. He points out that they did not keep this festival in Egypt where they could buy flour for their unleavened bread because they did not spend the seven days of the festival period in Egypt.</i> Furthermore, Israel did not have bread<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">That is, flour. Hence they could not celebrate the festival of unleavened bread in the desert of Sinai.</i> from which to make unleavened bread for seven days in the desert of Sinai even though they were close to an inhabited place.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Where they could have bought provisions if they felt themselves obligated to do so.</i> It was a great thing that they found material out of which to make unleavened bread to eat with the bitter herbs and paschal lamb on the one night,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">On which they celebrated the Passover. See note 85.</i> for they were a very great multitude of people. Now logically speaking, Moses offered the daily burnt offering<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">See Ex. 29:38-42; Num. 28:1-8.</i> during the seven days of consecration and two lambs on the Sabbath day.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 28:9,10.</i> He offered the Sabbath burnt offering and then the consecration burnt offerings on which day of the seven days of consecration fell on a Sabbath. All of this is correct. However, what shall we do with the dedication of the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the sacrifices offered for the dedication of the altar.</i> on the Sabbath day?<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Each one of the 12 princes of Israel offered dedication sacrifices on each one of the 12 days following the seven days of consecration. See note 72. Now only those sacrifices mandated by the Torah may be sacrificed on the Sabbath. Personal offerings cannot be sacrificed on the Sabbath. Hence the question raised by I.E.</i> Some say that they skipped the Sabbath day.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">The princes of Israel did not offer their dedication sacrifice on the Sabbath.</i> They only counted the days that they dedicated the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, when the Torah tells us that the princes of Israel offered 12 sacrifices on the 12 days following the seven days of consecration it does not mean that they offered them on 12 successive days, for they skipped the Sabbath day.</i> Others say that the princes’ burnt offering was offered on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">See note 72.</i> However, the peace offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Which the prince should have offered on the Sabbath.

The prince<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is not to any of the princes mentioned in our chapter but rather to the prince mentioned in Ezek. 46.</i> who sacrifices<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the one who sends. <i>Vat.

These six lambs are burnt offerings. We thus see that a prince’s burnt offering may be sacrificed on the Sabbath.</i> The first group<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">The group mentioned earlier, who maintain that the princes did not offer their altar dedication sacrifices on the Sabbath.</i> says that when they circled Jericho for six days with the armed body in the lead<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">See Josh. 6:6-15.</i> they similarly skipped the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">In order not to violate the Sabbath.

They circled Jericho once a day for six days and seven times on the seventh day. This opinion maintains that they did not circle Jericho for seven successive days, for if they had done so they would have desecrated the Sabbath. This interpretation maintains that <i>And it came to pass on the seventh day</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>) does not refer to the Sabbath but rather to the seventh day of circling. It should be noted that according to the rabbis, Jericho fell on a Sabbath. See <i>Tal. Jer. Sabbath</i> 1:5, <i>Seder Olam</i> 11, <i>Ba-Midbar Rabbah</i> 14:1; 23:6.</i> They say the same with regard to the fourteen days.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The 14 days comprised the seven on which King Solomon celebrated the dedication of the temple plus the seven days of Sukkot.

They say that these 14 days were not celebrated back to back, for if they had been, then Israel would have eaten on the Day of Atonement. It should be noted that according to the rabbis these 14 days were celebrated back to back and that Israel ate on Yom Kippur that year. See <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 9a. Also see Kimchi on I Kings 8:65.</i> They skipped the Day of Atonement and did not count it.

Verse 35

AND MOSES WAS NOT ABLE TO ENTER. Then God called Moses and told him to enter the tent. Moses used to speak with God face to face in the place where the high priest entered once a year with a cloud of incense,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">That is, in the Holy of Holies. See Lev. 16:13.</i> because Moses was, as it were, a member of the house.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">God’s house. Hence God called to him to enter the Holy of Holies on ordinary days.</i> I was forced to say this<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">That Moses entered the Holy of Holies whenever God spoke to him (Meijler).</i> because Moses put the tablets in the ark. He similarly placed over the ark the covering with the cherubim on top. God’s glory was always upon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Upon the cherubim. Hence Moses had already seen God’s glory (Krinsky). He was thus, as it were, a member of God’s house.</i> Now what happened when Aaron and his sons took down the veil of the screen<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Which separated the Holy from the Holy of Holies.</i> outside the place where the ark was kept?<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 4:5: <i>when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of testimony with it</i>.</i> How did they approach it?<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Since God’s glory was upon the ark.</i> I therefore say that Moses alone entered beyond the veil. Aaron and his sons then took down the screen, which is called the veil.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">I.E. interprets <i>parokhet ha-masekh</i> (the veil of the screen) as the <i>parokhet</i>, that is, the screen.</i> Moses used to take the screen and immediately cover the ark of the covenant with it so that Aaron and his sons would not see it. Scripture writes, <i>and they shall cover the ark of testimony</i> (Num. 4:5)<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally.</i> because they assisted Moses. Others say that the priests covered the ark but did not face it.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">So that they would not gaze upon God’s glory.</i> Scripture states, <i>and there was fire therein by night</i>, and then goes on to say, <i>throughout all their journeys</i> (v. 38). This<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to Num. 14:14. See below.</i> also indicates that at times the cloud journeyed at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Some conclude on the basis of the aforementioned that at times the cloud journeyed at night.</i> Now we do not find it written that they journeyed at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture never explicitly states that Israel journeyed at night.</i> The one who says this<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">That Scripture never explicitly states that Israel journeyed at night.</i> explains <i>or if it continued by day and by night</i> (Num. 9:21) as referring to one day.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 9:21 states, <i>And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed; or if it continued by day and by night</i> (o yomam va-laylah), <i>when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed</i>. Now <i>o yomam va-laylah</i> can be translated in two ways: a) Or it continued by day and by night. b) Or it continued for a day or for a night. According to the latter translation our verse reads, “or if it continued by day or by night (o <i>yomam va-laylah</i>) when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.” Thus the verse teaches that Israel at times traveled at night. Hence those who maintain that Israel did not journey at night interpret <i>o yomam va-laylah</i> as referring to a 24-hour period, that is, a day and a night. This opinion interprets <i>o yomam va-laylah</i> as: or it continued by day and by night, that is, a full day consisting of a day and a night.</i> Now what will they do with the phrase <i>their journeys</i> (v. 38)? Scripture does not read: throughout all their encampments.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">If Scripture intended to teach that they journeyed during the day and camped at night, then our verse should have read: For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their “encampments,” rather than <i>For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their “journeys.”</i> The latter implies that Israel journeyed at night.</i> The correct meaning of <i>or…by day and by night</i> is: or day and night; or: or day or night.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Israel journeyed at night. Our text literally reads, “Its meaning is (<i>u-pirusho</i>), or day and night, or, or day or night.” This reading is a bit difficult. I.E. is trying to prove that Israel journeyed at night. Hence why mention the interpretation, or day and night (see note 122). Indeed, <i>Vat. Ebr.</i> 38 reads, “Its meaning is (<i>u-pirusho</i>), or day or night.” If we emend <i>pirusho</i> to <i>pirush</i> then our text reads, “The meaning of (<i>u-pirush</i>) <i>Or…by day and by night</i> is: or day or night.” This is probably the reading upon which our text is based, for <i>pirusho</i> seems to be a scribal error for <i>pirush</i>.</i> It is similar to <i>And he that curseth his father and his mother</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew, <i>aviv ve-immo</i> (his father and his mother).</i> <i>shall surely be put to death</i> (Ex. 21:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Translated literally. The meaning of Ex. 21:17 is, And he that curseth his father “or” his mother shall surely be put to death. We thus see that the <i>vav</i> sometimes has the meaning of or. Similarly, <i>yomam va-laylah</i> is not to be rendered day and night but rather day or night.</i> I had to say this because I noticed that the prayer which Moses uttered on the occasion of the scouts states, <i>and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night</i> (Num. 14:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">This verse implies that Israel journeyed at night, for <i>prima facie, and Thou goest before them</i> also refers to <i>and in a pillar of fire by night</i>.</i>
