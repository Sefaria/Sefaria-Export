Ibn Ezra on Jonah



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2

Nineveh - the royal seat of Assyria, which is a ruin today. And the sages of Israel in Greece say that it is the city called Ortei [Ortygia, Sicily?], but I do not know. Note that God did not command Jonah to say "In forty days..." only that "their evil has come before Me."
And those who explain that Jonah feared that he would be called a false prophet - by God forgiving them their evil - are incorrect, because God did not say this reason until the second time, where it says: 'the proclamation that I speak to you," - and that is when God says it will be forty days.
Moreover, how could a prophet rebel against God's command out of his fear that the people of Nineveh would call him a false prophet? How would that harm him? Would he dwell among them?
Further, the people of Nineveh weren't stupid. Why would God send a prophet to them for them to repent, and if they refused, the decree against them would be fulfilled - if they knew that this was so, that if they repent, God would forgive their evil - why would they then call Jonah a false prophet?!
Our sages of blessed memory were correct when they said that Jonah was distressed, for Israel's sake, that the people of Nineveh would escape [their fate].
[...]
The people of Nineveh had once been God-fearing, and had only begun to do evil in Jonah's time. And were it not that they used to be God-fearing, God would not have sent a prophet to them. We see that they did a complete, even unparalleled teshuvah, and we do not find any text that says they tore down their altars to Baal or their idols. And so we learn that they were not idolaters.

Verse 3

He went and fled to Jaffa: The gaon said that Tarshish is Tarsus. But Rabbi Mevaser says that it is Tunis in Africa.

Verse 4



Verse 5



He lay down and slept - from seasickness, and perhaps this was his first time on a ship.

Chapter 2



Verse 1


and Jonah remained: no one can survive in the belly of a fish even for an hour, so if this is the duration, it must have been a miracle.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

Commanded: this is a metaphor. God caused it to do God's will.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

"And it was"- [for] a second time.

Verse 2

"Get up"- He [God] is showing him [Yonah] that he did not go a way that distanced him from Nineveh [since the fish spat him out on the shore of Nineveh], [therefore] if He sends him a second time, he will go.

Verse 3

"And he got up": Rabbi Yeshuah said that the sailors went to Nineveh and spoke about [or, spoke the message of] Yonah. This is why they believed him, and the word "to god" explains this [to be the case].
"a three-day walk"- [to walk] around the city is a one day, [if one is only traveling] from one end to the other [and not throughout the entire city, as we might assume Yonah did], or [maybe] he did not walk [three days into the city] to call out, [rather he] only [walked] one day's walk because of this.

Verse 4

"And he started"- Some say:
that "overturned" [means] that it would overturn [itself] from [doing] it's evil actions, and this interpretation is not correct; [rather] the [interpretation of the] matter is only like [the verse]: "For a moment I speak [of a nation to be destroyed and smashed...]" (Jeremiah 18:7)

Verse 5

"And they believed"- [this case is] like [it says in the verse]: "and the people believed" (Shemot 4:31).
and the essence of [the meaning of the word]: "in God" is [that the believed] "in the word of God."

Verse 6

"And it reached"- this [was] before the donning of the sackcloth.
"And he took off"- [this word ויעבר means] remove.
"And he covered"- his flesh[himself] in sackcloth, [and this is not meant to be read that he simply "covered"], for this a transitive verb [which requires an object on which to act in the sentence, thus he covered himself].

Verse 7

"And he cried" - [the understanding of this phrase stems] from the reasoning [that he screamed] from his counsel, knowledge, and intellect, like [it says in the verse] "[A Psalm of David,] when he changed his sanity [before Avimelech, and he drove him out and he left...]"(Tehillim 34:1).

Verse 8

"And they shall cover themselves," "and they shall call out [to God]"- [The king's proclamation said:] "Any man who is a knowledgeable person, or someone who knows they have done evil," or [the decree was saying] like [that which it says when Avraham entreated God regarding Sodom] "Perhaps [there are ten good men to be found there?]" (Bereshit 18:32).
And the word "and he will return" is [going] on the glorious name [of God].

Verse 9



Verse 10

"And God saw" - that they believed in him. And it [the people's belief] is like this [episode] in [Parshat] Yitro: "before God." (Shemot 18:12).
"And he relented"- [In describing God with human attributes, the Torah here employs the principle] "The torah spoke like the language of human beings."

Chapter 4



Verse 1

"And it displeased him..."- that God relented.

Verse 2



Verse 3

Now: seeing that Israel had not repented, he feared that harm would come to them, and so he prayed, "please take my life," like Moses said "erase me [from Your book]...
