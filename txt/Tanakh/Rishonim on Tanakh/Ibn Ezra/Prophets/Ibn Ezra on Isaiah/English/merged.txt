Ibn Ezra on Isaiah

Prelude

The prophecies are profound and lofty;
The wise-hearted see them, and are lost in admiration.
May the Almighty grant strength to Abraham,
Who intends to explain the book of Isaiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"><br><span>סוֹדוֹת מְאׂד עָמְקוּ וְגָבָהוּ</span><br><span>יִרְאוּם נְבוֹנֵי לֵב וְיִהְמָהוּ ׃</span><br><span>יִתּן אֱלֹהִים עוֹז לְאַבְרָהָם</span><br><span>הַבָּא לְפָרֵשׁ סוֹד יְשַׁעְיָהוּ ׃ </span><br>The printed editions have in the last line <span>סֵפֶר</span>, instead of <span>סוד</span>, the reading presented by a M.S. of the British Museum (Add. 24896). <span>סוד</span> is certainly more correct, since the additional syllable in <span>ספר</span> would spoil the metre. Each line consists of two simple syllables, and one compound (a syllable preceded by a Shva mobile, or by a compound Shva), two simple syllables and one compound, and two simple syllables. This metre is described by I. E. in his Sefer Zahoth, on the metre (No. 11): <span>ב׳ תנועות ויתד, ב׳ תנועות ויתד ׳ וב׳ תנועות (.־־־־, ־־־־, ־־) </span>, and may best be compared with the trimeter iambicus catalecticus of the Greek and Latin Literature. The Shva under the מ in <span>עָמְקוּ</span> is treated in this strophe as a quiescent Shva. This is in contradiction to the well-known rule, that a long vowel, not having the accent—as, <i>e.g.,</i> the Kamez under ע in <span>עמקו</span>—cannot be followed by a quiescent Shva. I. E. ignores this rule, and even finds fault with <span>תֵּשְׁבִי</span> “thou wilt sit,” being read <span>תֵּ־שְׁבִי</span> (Zahoth, On the Metre, No. 17). In the same way he reads <span>עָלְ־תָה</span> instead of <span>עָ־לְתָה</span> “she went up” (ibid. No. 4); <span>וּלְ־שׁוֹ־נִי</span> instead of <span>וּ־לְשׁוֹ־נִי</span> “and my tongue” (ibid. No. 1).</i>
T<small>HE</small> Lord is One, and His divine inspiration always the same. The prophecies, however, vary according to the receptive faculty of each prophet, which is not always the same. Some prophets received the inspiration only in a vision by night. Such were, <i>e.g.,</i> Abraham (Gen. 15:1), Gad the Seer (1 Chr. 29:29), and Isaiah (1:1).





Chapter 1



Verse 1

<span>חזון</span> <i>The vision of.</i> The נ is not radical.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <span>חזון</span> is <span>חזה</span> to see; in <span>חזון</span> the radical ה is omitted, and <span>וֹן</span> is added, as in <span>קדמון ,זכרון ,חשבון</span>.</i>
<i>The son of Amoz.</i> There exists an opinion, though a solitary one,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of R. Johanan (comp. Midrash Rabba, Leviticus 6), and Ulla (comp. Talmud Babli, Megilla 15a).</i> that when the father of a prophet is mentioned by name, he also was a prophet; another<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Levi said, ‘ We know by tradition that Amoz and Amaziah were brothers.’ (Talmud Babli, Megilla 10b.)</i> opinion is, that Isaiah was a member of the royal family, that his father Amoz and Amaziah<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Amaziah was king of Juda, before Uzziah, 835—806.</i> were brothers, and that the evil-disposed of Israel were unable on that account to do harm to Isaiah, as they did to Jeremiah (vid. Jer. 38); but in fact Isaiah did not escape persecution, for he says, I gave my back to smiters, etc. (1. 6). Irrespectively of all traditional explanations, we may say that the father of a prophet, if mentioned by name, was a man of some distinction, whose character rendered him conspicuous among his fellow-men; sometimes he was himself a prophet, at others not, <i>e.g</i>., David, the son of Jesse (2 Sam. 23:1). David was the man of God (2 Chron. 8:14), Jesse was not. It is with prophecy as with royalty; comp. Jehu, king of Israel, the son of Nimshi (1 Kings 19:16); Nimshi was not a king. We read, it is true, In the vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, the prophet<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A. V. The prophet, the son of Amoz.</i> (2 Chron. 32:32), where the qualifying term, the prophet, may as well be referred to Amoz as to Isaiah; but from the words, To Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz (2 Kings 19:2), we learn that Isaiah was the prophet. <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is not so evident as I. E. seems to believe; since from the same two verses just the opposite inference is made, Midrash Rabba (Leviticus 6); namely, that both Isaiah and Amoz were prophets, because the epithet, the prophet, is in the one verse closely joined to the former, in the other to the latter. Ibn Ezra, who recommends the accents as an excellent guide for the reading and understanding of the Bible (comp. 5:9), should have gathered better evidence from the accents. <span>אמוץ</span> has a disjunctive accent, and is to be separated from the following <span>הנְביא</span> ; were they to be joined, their accents would be in the following way, <span>ישעיה֨ו בן־אמ֣וץ הנביא</span></i> Thus the forefathers of Zephania are named (Zeph. 1:1), because the king Hezekiah was one of them.
<i>Concerning Judah and Jerusalem</i>. The greater part of Isaiah’s prophecies refer to the cities of Judah, which were to be taken by the king of Assyria, and to Jerusalem, which was to be delivered out of his hand; the whole of the second part of the Book of Isaiah has as its subject the exile of Judah, the other tribes not being mentioned here at all.
<i>In the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</i> Isaiah very probably commenced his prophetical career in the last year of King Uzziah, as shall be explained below (6:1). In strict regard to the words of the text, we think that he died in the days of Hezekiah; for had he lived in the days of Manasse, the son of Hezekiah, it would certainly have been stated in this verse. Some say that Isaiah was slain by Manasse, because he exclaimed, Mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts (6:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Manasse is said to have tried and condemned Isaiah for having declared that he had seen the Lord, in contradiction to the words of the Law, There shall no man see me and live (Exod. 33:20); comp. Talm. Babli, Yebamoth 49b; Talm. Jerushalmi, Sanhedrin 10:2.</i> If this statement is based on tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Simeon ben Azai (Talm. Babli, Yebamoth 49b) bases this statement on notes found in a Megillath Johasim, a sort of family record; the question, however, still remains whether those notes were derived from any ancient and trustworthy authority.</i> it may be accepted.

Verse 2

<span>והאזיני</span> <i>And give ear.</i> Sometimes verbs are derived from nouns, as <span>האזיני</span>, ‘give ear,’ from <span>אׂזֶן</span> ‘ ear.’ .There is in reality no difference between <span>שמע</span> ‘to hear’ and <span>האזן</span> ‘to give ear.’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">By the additional phrase <span>על דרך פשט</span> in reality, the commentator indicates that he rejects the various remarks of the Midrash about the difference between Is. 1:1 and Deut. 32:1, and likewise the distinction drawn between the synonyms <span>שמע</span> and <span>האזן</span>. (See Yalkut <i>ad locum</i>).</i>—Isaiah begins his prophecy, by addressing those witnesses, that have been pointed out to Israel by Moses, when he said I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish (Deut. 4:26); the time, foretold by Moses, had then come.
<i>For the Lord speaketh.</i> Listen to His word, since it is the Lord that speaketh ; or, because the Lord has commanded you to listen.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first explanation, the phrase for the Lord speaketh refers to the following prophecy, which, although spoken by Isaiah, is nevertheless the word of God, who inspires the prophet. The second explanation requires the rendering of <span>דבר</span> by the past hath spoken or hath commanded, and the supplying of the Infinitive to hear or to listen.</i>
<i>I have nourished and brought up children.</i> The Israelites are compared to feeble children, who, nevertheless, through the care of their father are enabled to distinguish themselves amongst their companions.
<span>פשעו בי</span> <i>They have rebelled against me.</i> They withdrew from my command (comp. 2 Kings 8:22; Exod. 22:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This explanation of <span>פשע</span> seems to be derived from the phrase <span>פשע מתחת יד</span> ‘to rebel ’ (2 Kings 8:22)—literally, to withdraw from the authority of—and to be supported by <span>דבר פשע</span> (Exod. 22:8), an object that was lost by its owner—literally, that has slipped away from its possessor. Our author, however, in his commentary to Exodus explains <span>דבר פשע</span>, as generally understood, an object of trespass, and contrasts with this explanation, the one above mentioned as the opinion of R. Joshua ; eventually he seems to have entirely adopted the meaning given in the text, as is also to be seen in the abridged commentary on Exodus (22:8).</i>

Verse 3

<i>The ox knoweth, etc.</i> Ox and ass are mentioned, as animals which are in constant use among people.
<span>אבוס</span> <i>the crib.</i> The place for the ass’s food. The form of the word is in the construct state the same as in the absolute. The participle passive Kal, 1) <span>אבוסים</span> Kings 5:3) and <span>אבוס</span> (Prov. 15:17), ‘fatted,’ is derived from this word ; it means literally, ‘placed at the crib.’
<i>Israel doth not know.</i> They are, therefore, in their character inferior to the cattle.
<i>My people doth not consider.</i> Repetition of the preceding idea, as usual in most of the prophecies, in the song of Moses (Deut. 32), in the parables of Balaam (Num. 23., 24i&gt;My people doth not consider. Repetition of the preceding idea, as usual in most of the prophecies, in the song of Moses (Deut. xxxii.), in the parables of Balaam (Num. xxiii., xxiv.), etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew the repetition is used in the prophetical but not in the historical style.—I. E. on Ex. 14:19.</i> The meaning of the whole verse is, I have brought them up, but they do not know me.

Verse 4

<span>הוי</span>. Some consider the ה as a substitute for א, and explain <span>אוי ═ הוי</span>, ‘woe;’ comp. <span>אדורם</span> and <span>הדורם</span>, N. pr. (2 Chr. 10:18; 1 Kings 12:18); <span>איך</span> and <span>היך</span>, how (1 Chr. 13:12 ; 2 Sam. 6:9); but I think that it is a sign of the vocative case (derived from the verb <span>היה</span> ‘to be’), and that the passage must be rendered, O sinful people, etc. ; comp. <span>הוי הוי ונסו</span>, Ho, ho, flee (Zach. 2:10), <span>הוי ציון המלטי</span> O Zion, deliver thyself (<i>Ibid</i>. 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the two passages quoted by the author, <span>הוי</span> cannot be translated by ‘ woe,’ because it is followed by good tidings.—Ibn Ezra does not mean to say that <span>הוי</span> is never used instead of <span>אוי</span> (woe); for in this same chapter (ver. 24) he admits the identity of these two words.—The connection between <span>היה</span> ‘ to be ’ and <span>הוי</span> ‘ Oh ’ is not clear. Comp. Zahoth, On the Aleph.</i> The second person is, therefore, used in the next verse, Why should ye be stricken any more.
<span>כֶבֶד</span> <i>Laden with.</i> An adjective in the construct state; comp. <span>עֶרֶל לב ועֶרֶל בשר</span>, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh (Ez. 44:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><span>כֶּבֶד</span> is, according to Ibn Ezra, not a substantive, the burden of, but the construct state of the adjective <span>כָּבֵד</span>, heavy of, heavy with regard to; like <span>עֶרֶל</span> uncircumcised with regard to—the construct state of the adjective <span>עָרֵל</span>, uncircumcised.</i>
<i>Seed of evil doers.</i> They and their forefathers have been wicked ; or, their father was an Amorite, their mother a Hittite (Ez. 16:3),<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites are, according to this explanation, called a seed of evil-doers, because their forefathers, the ancestors of Abraham, were idolators.</i> as I shall explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The commentary of Ibn Ezra on Ezekiel is not known.</i>
<span>משחיתים</span> <i>Corrupters.</i> That corrupt their soul or their way.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><span>משחיתים</span> is the participle Hiphil, and has therefore originally the causative meaning, causing their soul or way to be corrupt.</i>
<i>They have forsaken the Lord,</i> that is, the service of the Lord.
<span>נאצו</span> <i>They have provoked unto anger.</i>
<span>נזורו</span>. <i>They are gone away.</i> Root <span>נזר</span> ‘to separate’ ; comp. <span>וינזרו</span> that they separate themselves (Lev. 22:2). <span>נָזוֹרוּ</span> is formed like <span>יָבׂלוּ</span> ‘ they could ’ (Exod. 8:14). Many take it as Niphal of <span>זור</span> ‘ to separate ’; comp. <span>נָכוֹנוּ</span> ‘ they are prepared ’ (Prov. 19:29); Niphal of <span>כּוּן</span>, ‘ to stand.

Verse 5

<span>תֻּבּוּ</span>. <i>Should ye be stricken.</i> The ת in <span>תֻּבּוּ</span>, they sat down. (Deuter. 33:3), is part of the root—<span>תֻּבּוּ</span> being Pual of <span>תכה</span> ; comp. <span>וְשֻׁפּוּ</span> and they stick out (Job 33:21)—but here it is the prefix representing the second person; <span>תֻּבּוּ</span> being Hophal of <span>נכה</span>.—<i>You will revolt more and more</i>. The more you are smitten, the more you revolt, while the proper way for you would be to repent; comp., And in the time of his—Ahaz, king of Judah’s—distress did he trespass yet more against the Lord. (2 Chr. 28:22.)
<span>סָרָה</span> <i>Rebellious.</i> Adjective; root <span>סרר</span>, ‘to be rebellious,’ comp. <span>סורר</span>, ‘rebellious’ (Deuter. 21:18); supply <span>מלה</span> or <span>דברה</span> ‘ word;’ <span>סרה</span> may also be taken as a substantive, ‘ rebellion.’
<i>The whole head is sick.</i> Whereupon shall ye be stricken? for the whole head is afflicted already with all kinds of sickness, etc. The head and heart are mentioned as the principal parts of the body.
<span>דַּוָּי</span> <i>Faint.</i> Adjective; a form like <span>נַּנָּב</span> ‘ thievish,’ <span>סַלָּח</span> ‘ placable.

Verse 6

<span>מְתוֹם</span> <i>A place containing soundness</i> (<span>תּוֹם</span> ‘ soundness or integrity’). The form of the word is irregular, for it should be <span>מָתוֹם</span> like <span>מָעוֹז</span> (25:4). The same form is used Ps. 38:4. R. Moses Hakkohen says that <span>מְתוֹם</span> is the same as <span>מְתִים</span> ‘ people ;’ he quotes a parallel, Judges 20:48, and explains our verse, there is nothing in them that is good for man; but this explanation is rather far-fetched.
<span>פצע</span> <i>Wounds.</i> Supply the word <span>רק</span> ‘only,’ ‘but,’ before <span>פצע</span>. There is no soundness in him ; there are but wounds and bruises ; comp. <span>שיאכל ושתה אין טוב באדם</span> There is nothing good for man <i>but</i> that he should eat and drink. (Eccles. 2:24).
<span>פצע</span> <i>A wound</i> caused by the breaking of the bone.
<span>חבורת</span> <i>A sore</i> attended with suppuration. &gt;
<span>טריה</span> Fresh,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Putrefying.</i> not yet dry (comp. Judges 15:15); in Arabic the word طرا has the same meaning. ..
<span>זׂרוּ</span> <i>They have been squeezed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., They have been closed.</i> Root <span>זׁרד</span> ‘ to squeeze ’ (comp. Judges 6:38). The wound cannot be healed unless the matter is removed from it.
<span>חבשו</span> <i>They have been bound up.</i> Root <span>חבש</span> ‘ to compress,’ ‘to bind up ’ (comp. <span>חובש</span> ‘ruler,’ 3:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra seems to identify ruler with oppressor. Compare his commentary on 3:7, and Eccles. 4:16, The laws of kings are tyrannical.</i>
<span>בַּשָּׁמֶן</span> <i>With the oil</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., With ointment.</i> With the oil, which the cure of the wound requires.

Verse 7

<i>Your country, etc.</i> What has been said hitherto in figurative expressions is now repeated in plain language. All their land has been smitten, a part of it is desolate, without inhabitants, a part destroyed by fire, another part robbed of its produce by strangers.
<span>אכלים אתה</span> <i>Devour it.</i> Devour its produce; comp. <span>בעצבון תאכלנה</span> In sorrow shalt thou eat of it. (Gen. 3:17.)
<span>ושממה</span> <i>And desolate.</i> Supply <span>ארצכם</span> ‘ your country ’—and your country is desolate.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">It is not quite clear what Ibn Ezra means by this remark; perhaps that the expressive closing sentence, <span>ושממה כמהפכת זרים</span> And it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers, is to be taken in a more comprehensive sense, and referred to the general term <span>ארצכם</span> your country, which includes <span>עריכם</span> your cities, and <span>אדמתכם</span> your land.</i> <span>זרים</span> can be derived from <span>זרם</span> ‘ tempest ’ (32:2); the final מ would then be not a sign of the plural, but one of the radical letters; if so, if this derivation be correct, the two words <span>זרים</span> of this verse are two different grammatical forms.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Saadiah, attacked by R. Adonim, because of <span>זָרים</span> being different from the singular <span>זָרֶם</span> and the plural <span>זְרָמִים</span>, but defended by Ibn Ezra in his Sephath Yether (No. 22); this is one of the many instances of two nouns, different in form but identical in meaning, being formed from the same root; <span>זֶרֶם ═ זָרִים</span> ‘ tempest.’</i>

Verse 8

<i>And the daughter of Zion is left,</i> etc. The fortified cities of Judah will be taken and only Zion will be left.
<span>סוכה</span> <i>The hut.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Cottage.</i> The place for the watchman ; that is, the temple built in honour of the Almighty.
<span>מלונה</span> <i>A lodge,</i> where the watchman stays through the night. <span>במקשה</span> <i>In the garden of cucumbers.</i>
<span>נצורה</span> <i>Ruined</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Besieged.</i> (comp. 65:4)

Verse 9

<i>Except the Lord of hosts,</i> etc. These are the words of the Israelites, whom the prophet introduces now speaking.
<span>כמעָט֑</span> <i>Very small.</i> Join with <span>שׂריד</span> ‘remnant,’ because of its disjunctive accent; for it is an important rule, that the most careful notice should be taken of the accents.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The author himself sometimes overlooks this important rule; as, for instance, in his remark to ver. 1, <i>sub voce</i> the son of Amoz.</i>

Verse 10

<i>Hear the word of the Lord,</i> etc. The prophet replies to their complaint, We are like Sodom, by saying, If you were so, it would be but just, for your princes are like the princes of Sodom,—this is meant by the address, Ye rulers of Sodom—and the people is like the people of Gomorrah.

Verse 11

<i>To what purpose,</i> etc. Why should I leave you longer in the land ? Is it for the sake of the multitude of your burnt offerings ? <i>I am full,</i> etc. An anthropomorphism ; in reality, He does not want anything; comp. If I <i>were</i> hungry, I would not tell thee, etc. (Ps. 1. 12 ff).
<span>אילים</span> <i>Large sheep.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Rams.</i>
<span>מריאים</span> A species of cattle, akin to the ox, but larger; its fat is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">In the Rabbinical writings <span>חֵלֶב</span> is the forbidden fat, <span>שׁוּמָן</span> the permitted. The fat of the quadrupeds that were allowed to be eaten and were also admitted as offerings upon the altar, is prohibited (Leviticus 7:25); the fat of those that were not employed as sacrifices, but might serve as food to the Israelites, is permitted. In the former case the animals were called <span>בהמה</span> ‘ cattle’, in the latter <span>חיה</span> ‘beasts.’ According to Ibn Ezra <span>מריא</span> is a <span>בהמה</span> ; according to Saadiah it is a <span>חיה</span> (جاموس chamois). Comp. I. E. on Am. 5:22.</i> The Gaon<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">R. Hai (ibid.)</i> compares <span>מריאים</span> fed beasts with <span>מרא</span> to feed (Mishnah Sabbath 24:3).
<span>כבשים</span> The young of the flock.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Lambs.</i>
<span>עתודים</span> The old of the flock<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., He-goats.</i> (comp. Gen. 31:10)

Verse 12

<span>לפני═פני</span> <i>Before me;</i> it is not the object of <span>לֵרָאוֹח</span> ‘ to be seen.’<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><span>פעול</span>, object, is the person or thing to which the action is directed; the verb may be active or passive; <i>e.g.,</i> <span>לראות פני</span>, according to this opinion, rejected by I. E., When my face is seen; ‘my face’ is called object, though the nominative case. Comp. I. E. on Exod. 23:15.</i>
<span>רמוס</span> <i>To tread.</i> Infinitive.

Verse 13

<span>לא תוסיפו</span> <i>Ye shall not continue</i>. A prohibition (comp. Deut. 4:2); not a mere future.
<span>להביא═הביא</span> <i>To bring. Vain oblations</i>, etc. For your oblation is vain in mine eyes, and your incense an abomination.
<span>ראש חדש═חדש</span> <i>Day of the new moon.</i> In the Pentateuch it is clearly stated<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. refers perhaps to the words <span>עלת חדש</span>, Num. 28:14, which are the same as <span>עלת ראש חדש</span>, the burnt offering of the new moon. In his commentary on Exod. 12:2 he shows in the form of a short dialogue between R. Moses Hakkohen and his opponents, that <span>חדש</span> signifies New moon. Comp. I. E. on Exod. 19:1 and Num. 28:14. The word <span> חדש</span> signifies also ‘month,’ that is, the time from one new moon to the other; as <span>שבת</span>, originally ‘ Sabbath,’ is also used to signify the time which passes between one Sabbath and the other, the week.</i> that the word bears this meaning, New-moon.
<span>קרא מקרא</span> That you proclaim them to be holy convocations.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., The calling of assemblies. Comp.

Num. 28 and xxix.</i>
<span>לא אוכל</span> <i>I cannot bear.</i> Supply the word <span>נְשאׁ</span>, ‘to bear.’ Comp. <span>חמור לחם</span> an ass <i>laden with</i> bread (1 Sam. 16:20).
<span>עצרה</span> <i>Restraint</i>. Comp. <span>עׂצֶר</span> ‘prison’ (53:8). Restraint from doing any work. <span>עצרת</span> (Lev. 23:36) has the same meaning. <i>Iniquity and restraint</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Even the solemn meeting.</i> God cannot bear iniquity coupled with the observance of holy days; for of what use is it to keep holy days and to do evil at the same time.

Verse 14

<i>They are a trouble unto me.</i> These words imply the threat, I shall therefore banish you, and they—the festivals—will then cease.
<i>I am weary.</i> A figurative expression.

Verse 15

<span>ובפרשכם</span> <i>And when ye spread forth.</i> The Hirik under ר is instead of Segol.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The infinitive Piel is <span>פָּרֵש</span> ; when <span>כֶם</span> is added the syllable <span>רֵש</span> loses the accent, and the long vowel Zere must therefore be shortened; this is usually done by changing Zere into Segol; to change it into Hirek, as in <span>וּבְפֽרִשְׁכֶם</span>, is exceptional.</i>
<i>I will hide mine eyes from you</i>. I will keep away mercy from you.
<i>I will not hear.</i> These words contain the same idea, I will not help you. 
<i>Your hands are full of blood.</i> Because your hands, etc. <i>Blood</i>. Bloodshed.

Verse 16

<i>Wash</i>. Wash your hands of the blood they have shed.

Verse 18

<span>ונוכחה</span>. Some say that God is now speaking ; Let us—God and Israel—reason together (comp. Mic. 6:2); but I think the words may well be assigned to the prophet; as if he said God told me that we—you, Israel, and I—should submit to His rebuke ; for the prophet himself was not entirely without blame, as he reports, And He reproved me, that I should not walk, etc. (8:11), as I shall explain below (6:5).
<span>שנים</span> <i>Scarlet</i> (comp. Exod. 25:4). The idea contained in this verse is the reverse of that conveyed by the words of Jeremiah, Though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me (Jerem. 2:22); namely, the iniquity will depart, and you will again be free from all sin. The same is expressed by the words Wash you, etc. (ver. 16).
<i>Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</i> A repetition of the same idea.

Verse 19

<i>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.</i> Otherwise, the strangers before-mentioned (ver. 7) will consume it.

Verse 20

<i>You shall be devoured with the sword.</i> That is to say, If you be obedient you shall eat the good, and if you rebel you shall be devoured with the sword. Supply before <span>חֶרֶב</span> ‘ the sword,’ either the verbal noun <span>אֲכִילַת</span>. ‘ a devouring of,’ or the preposition ב ‘ with ’ ; comp. <span>בבית ═ בית</span> ‘ in the house ’ (2 Kings 18:15). 
<i>For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</i> Be sure that this prediction will be fulfilled, for the mouth, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The words <span>וזה האמת</span>, and this is the truth, are very often used by I.

E. was in favour of the last mentioned explanation, <span>בחרב ═ חרב</span> ; but then the words for the mouth, etc., would be quite superfluous, or I. E.’s remark on them must be missing. In the translation they explain the causal conjunction <span>כי</span> ‘ for,’ in the phrase <span>כי ה׳ דבר</span>. (Comp. I. E. on Mic. 4:4.)</i>

Verse 21

The prophet has thus reproved the people but they do not listen.

<span>מהול</span> <i>Mixed.</i> The ה is one of the radical letters. Hapax legomenon.

Verse 23

<span>שלמנים</span> <i>Rewards.</i> (Comp. Exod. 22:5). They perverted judgment; the judge said, Give me such and such a sum, and it shall stand thee in good part in thy lawsuit with thy neighbour.
<i>To the orphan</i>—of whom they are not afraid. <i>They judge not.</i> That is, they do not render justice.
<i>The cause of the widow</i>—which she has to bring forward. <i>Doth not come unto them:</i> they do not like to hear her cause, therefore it does not come before them.

Verse 24

<span>נאום</span> <i>The word of</i>. A noun (comp. Jer. 23:31).

<i>The Lord.</i> This is added because the judges appear as the lords of the earth.
<i>The Lord of hosts.</i> He is truly the Lord, and the hosts of the universe are His witnesses. Why the name of God is joined, in the construct state, to <span>צבאות</span>, though being a proper noun, is explained in the Book of Samuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Read Book of Exodus. The word Samuel seems to be a mistake which has its origin in the abbreviation <span>(שמות ═) שמו׳</span> being wrongly completed as <span>שמואל</span>. Ibn Ezra, on Ex. 3:14, observes, that the tetragrammaton is a proper noun; but although generally proper nouns in Hebrew cannot be joined to a genitive, there are a few exceptions; and the connexion of the name of God with the genitive of <span>צבאות</span>, is one of them; this exception is justified, because He is not only the Absolute Being, but also the Creator and Ruler of the Universe. The name of God may therefore be considered as identical with the common noun Ruler, and be followed by a genitive. It is, however, possible that the words <span>מפורש בשמואל</span> are correct, and refer to 2 Sam. 6:2, to the statement that the holy ark is called by His name, whence I. E. deduces, that the name of God is both a proper noun and a common noun. Comp. Yesod Mora, 100:12.</i>
The mighty One of Israel, and The Lord of hosts compose a parallelism, in which Israel on earth beneath corresponds to the hosts of heaven above, for the Israelites are likewise called the hosts of God (comp. Exod. 12:41).

Chapter 2



Verse 1

T<small>HIS</small> chapter commences a new prophecy, but not without connection with the preceding. Zion will now be saved from the hands of Sennacherib,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the subject of the first chapter; the second begins with describing the salvation of Israel, which will be effected in the distant future.</i> and she will besides be highly distinguished in the future.

Verse 2

This will take place, as the prophet says, <i>In the last of the days</i>. That is, in the days of Messiah, which are the last of the days of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">By The last of the days of the world Ibn Ezra points to the furthermost period of time, the period of the highest degree of perfection and salvation, which will undergo no fresh change, nor suffer any relapse into former imperfections. Such a period, Ibn Ezra says, has not yet come, because war has not yet ceased.</i> Those days have not yet come; for since the days of Isaiah there has never been a period free from war. We learn from Josephus, and the literature of the Persians and Medes,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Another reading for <span>ומרי</span> is <span>רומי</span> and Romans.</i> that during the whole time of the second temple in Jerusalem war had never ceased. Moreover,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning is, Even if the records here referred to were not trust-worthy, and if for a certain period war had really ceased, it has been resumed again; while the period of Messiah requires ‘ that war should not be learnt <i>any more</i>.’</i> the prophet distinctly declares, Neither shall they learn war any more.
<i>And shall be exalted.</i> We know that the mount of the temple will not be physically raised; but what the phrase means is, that it will be established in such a way that people will hasten up to it from the four comers of the earth, as if it were higher than all hills.
<span>ונהרו</span> <i>And they will flow.</i> Root, <span>נהר</span> ‘to flow’; comp. <span>נהר</span> river, which is so called on account of its flowing motion.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<i>And he shall judge.</i> He, who is the judge, the Messiah, shall judge (comp. Numb. 26:59).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The passage referred to is <span>אֲשֶׁר יָלְדָה אׂחָהּ</span>, ‘ whom she bare’: no noun precedes the phrase, whose substitute the pronoun she should be. In this and similar elliptical cases, Ibn Ezra usually supplies a participle or a verbal noun from the verb; as, for instance, <span>היולדת</span> ‘ the mother,’ implied in the verb <span>יָלְדָה</span> or <span>הַשׁׂפֵט</span> implied in the verb <span>וְשָׁפַט</span>; sometimes he completes the elliptical phrase from the context; comp. ver. 8.</i>
<span>לְאִתִּים</span> <i>Into plowshares.</i> Comp. <span>אֵתוֹ</span> his plowshare (1 Sam. 13:20); the Dagesh of the ת compensates for the omitted silent letter י; the same purpose is served by the long vowel Zere under א in the word  <span><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Long vowels are either really or virtually followed by one of the silent letters <span>אהוי</span> ; namely, Kamez by א or ה, Zere and Hirek by י, Holem and Shurek by ו.</i>.אֵתוֹ</span>
<span>למזמרות</span> <i>Pruning-hooks.</i> Instruments for pruning the vineyards.

Verse 5

<i>O house of Jacob,</i> etc. With these words the prophet rebukes Israel, as if he said, Since Zion will now, as you are well aware, be redeemed for her justice, and a time, besides, will come for her great salvation, we all owe obedience to the words of the prophecies, which are true as the light. The prophet includes himself in this rebuke, by using the first person plural, <i>pro formd,</i> as Moses did when he prayed, forgive our iniquity; or because he grew up among the people and acquired something of their mode of speaking,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. 6:5, I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips and I. E. on Is. 1:18.</i> as I shall explain (6:5)

Verse 6

<i>Thou hast forsaken,</i> etc. Some refer the second person to God, and say that the prophet confesses here before Him that He has justly forsaken them, for they are full of Eastern customs, etc. R. Moses Hakkohen refers it to Israel, and explains accordingly : Thou, O Israel, hast forgotten thy people and its religion. 
<span>מלאו</span> According to some, they are enthusiastic; comp. <span>מלא</span> with enthusiasm<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A.

Aram in the east, and the Philistines in the west (9:11); the next is, therefore, And are soothsayers like the Philistines. <span>בית יעקב</span> in this verse must then be vocative, like the first (5:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew text this remark is wrongly placed at the end of the next sentence.</i>
<span>ובילדי</span> <i>And with ideas of</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A.

They are satisfied with secular knowledge, and do not seek for the prophecy, which is the best light.

Verse 7

<i>Full of silver and gold.</i> Silver is mentioned before gold, because it is in quantity more abundant.
<span>קצה</span> <i>End.</i> ה is paragogic, like ה in <span>לילה</span> night; the accent is therefore on the penultima.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Nouns ending in <span>–ָה</span> or <span>–ֶה</span> have generally the accent on the last syllable; but there are exceptions to this rule, and one of them is, that if these terminations are paragogic, the last but one has the accent.</i>
In the preceding verse Israel is described as wise, in this as rich and mighty; in the same order Jeremiah enumerates these qualities (Jer. 9:23)

Verse 8

<span>אלילים</span> <i>Idols.</i> Root <span>אַל</span> "not"; the idols are called by this name, because there is no reality in them. 
<i>They worship the work of his</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A.

Verse 9

<span>וישה</span> <i>And boweth down.</i> Niphal of <span>שחח</span>; comp. <span>וימס</span> ‘And it was melted’ (Jos. 7:5) Niphal of <span>מסס</span>. Their acts degraded them.
<span>ואל תשא להם</span> According to some—the ת being the sign for the second person, and referring to God—and thou forgive them not. I am, however, of opinion that the passage has the following meaning: Not one of them dares to lift up his head or soul, because the context requires a phrase similar to And the man humbles himself ; or that the word <span>ארץ</span> ‘ the earth ’ is to be supplied: And the earth is not able to bear them<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">They are so vile that the earth cannot bear them any longer—that they do not deserve to live any longer upon the surface of the earth.</i> (comp.

Verse 11

<span>עיני</span> <i>The looks of.</i> <span>עין</span> ‘eye,’ or ‘ look,’ though generally feminine, is sometimes masculine (as <i>e.g.</i> in this verse, since the masculine form <span>שָׁפֵל</span> is joined to <span>עֵינֵי</span>) ; and <span>עֵינֵי</span> ‘ the looks,’ is identical with <span>כל אחד מעיני</span> ‘ each of the looks’; comp. <span>בנות</span> ‘ each of the branches ’ (Gen. 49:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The peculiarity of a noun in the plural being joined as nominative to a verb in the singular (as, <i>e.g.,</i> in <span> עֵינֵי נבהות אדם שָׁפֵל</span> The lofty looks of man shall be humbled) is explained by giving to the plural the meaning one of, or each of.</i>
<i>Haughtiness.</i> The contrary, lowliness, is meant; comp.

Verse 13

<i>The cedars, etc.</i> All this may be taken either literally, or symbolically for the young, great, rich, mighty, and the kings.

Verse 14

<span>ההרים</span> <i>The mountains.</i> I derive <span>הרים</span> from <span>הרה</span> to conceive, as I shall explain in the Book of Psalms (148:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary on Ps. 148:9, Ibn Ezra says that the mountains are pregnant (<span>הרה</span>) with all kinds of metals; therefore they are called <span>הָרִים</span>.</i>

Verse 15

<i>The tower.</i> The tower on the royal palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This remark is made in opposition to the opinion of those who refer the tower to the ships. (See Rashi <i>ad locum</i>.)</i>

Verse 16

<i>Ships of Tarshish.</i> If taken figuratively, they signify the merchants; literally, they are ships which belong to Israelites, and are going to Tarshish.

Verse 17

<i>And the loftiness, etc.</i> This idea is repeated here, because all the objects previously enumerated, excite pride in those that possess them, and cause dejection to those that lose them.

Verse 18

<span>יחלוף</span> <i>He shall abolish.</i> Comp. <span>בני חלוף</span> the afflicted (Prov. 31:5), to whom death is imminent; this root has a similar meaning in <span>חלף</span> it is over (Song 2:11).

<i>Cease ye, etc.</i> Since God has issued His decrees against you, as indicated in the words ‘ Because of the fear of the Lord,’ etc. (ver. 10), no man has the power to undo them; cease, therefore, to rely on man, he will not help you, for he is vanity.

Verse 1

T<small>HIS</small> Chapter is either the explanation of the latter part of Chapter II., beginning the cedars, the mountains, etc. (2:13, ff.) or the continuation of the subject, commencing Cease, ye from man, etc. (2:22); I adopt this latter view.

The Hebrew text has the words <span>והחומר הוא עשרת כורים</span> the Homer has ten Kur. This statement is contradicted by Ez. 45:14, where Homer and Kur are declared to be equal. The concluding words Bath and Epha are equal, show that the purpose of I. E.’s remarks is to explain the parallelism of this verse: ten pairs of vineyards—Homer, Bath—Epha. We read, therefore, <span>צמדי כרם</span> instead of <span>.כורים</span></i> Bath and Epha are likewise equal.

Moses Hakkohen with regard to <span>נבל צשור</span>, while he himself is of the opinion that these two words signify two different musical instruments.</i> <span>חליל</span> <i>Pipe</i>. Likewise a hollow instrument; <span>חליל</span> is of the same root as <span>חלול</span>, hollow. 
<i>And they regard not the work of the Lord</i>. Many explain, They regard, etc., because he who is given to drunkenness does not regard the ways of the Lord; comp. Whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise (Prov. 20:1); but my opinion is, that by the work of the Lord those punishments are to be understood which the Lord was bringing over Israel, when the ten tribes went into exile.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<i>And one cried unto another</i>. The number of the seraphim is not mentioned; some believe they were two, but I am of opinion that there were many. 
<i>Holy, holy, holy</i>. Repeated thrice, to express the continuity of the declaration. Comp. Jer. 7:4, Jer. 22:29. 
<i>Holy</i>. An adjective. Holiness is an essential attribute of the Lord; it is therefore the same in every place. God showed Isaiah this vision, that he might purify himself from the uncleanness of the lips; for the Lord is holy, and so also should be His servants and messengers. 
<i>Hosts</i>. Angels that are above.
<i>The whole earth</i>, etc. Although He is holy above, still His glory filleth the earth below. He who explains <span>מלא כל הארץ</span> that which filleth the whole earth, that is, its inhabitants, and compares it with <span>וּמְלאׇׁהּ</span> and the fulness thereof (Ps. 24), is mistaken.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra does not show why this explanation is wrong; nor does he give any opinion of his own as to what form <span>מְלאׁ</span> is; the quotation, Num. 14:21, only shows that a phrase like the glory of the Lord filleth the whole earth, is correct; but he fails to prove the identity of this quotation with <span>הארץ כבודו מלא כל</span>. In his commentary on Num. 22:18, however, he explains <span>בֵּיתוֹ מָלֵא כסף ═ מְלאׁ ביתו כסף</span> and quotes <span>מלא כל הארץ</span> as a parallel.</i> Comp. <span>ה׳ את כל הארץ וימלא כבוד</span> And the whole earth will be full of the glory of the Lord.

Verse 4

<i>And the posts of the threshold moved</i>. It was as if the threshold would move away from its place.
<span>אמות</span> <i>Posts</i>. About the meaning of the word there is no question; in this sense, it is, according to some,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.

<span>ההמון הקורא מקול ═ מקול הקורא</span> At the voice of the multitude that cried.
The verse begins with the past <span>וינועו</span>, and continues with the future <span>ימלא</span>, because the Hebrew language has no special form for the imperfect tense; past and future are therefore used for it promiscuously.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 1:21 and Chap. i., Note 43.</i>

Verse 5

<span>נדמיתי</span> <i>I am undone</i>. I am cut off from the company of the holy ones; comp. <span>ודמיתי</span> And I will destroy (Hos. 4:5). Some compare it with <span>דׂמִּי</span> Be silent (Ps. 62:6). This view also may be correct.
<i>A man of unclean lips</i>. The prophet was a man of unclean lips, I think, because he grew up with the Israelities, that were unclean in deeds and words, and he learnt their way of speaking; comp. And he warned me not to go the way of this people (8:11); therefore he says, And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I am dwelling. 
<i>For mine eyes have seen the king</i>, who is holy, and whom I was afraid to anctify because of the uncleanness of my lips. Although he says, Mine eyes have seen, etc., it is but in a prophetical vision that he saw Him.

Verse 6

<span>ויעׇף</span> <i>Then flew</i>. As written here, with a short kamez under <span>ע</span>, it is derived from <span>עוף</span> to fly; but <span>ויעַף</span> (Jud. 4:21), where the <span>ע</span> has a pathah, is derived from <span>עיף</span> to be weary.
<span>רצפה</span> <i>A live coal</i>. Comp. <span>רצפים</span> coals (1 Kings 19:6).
<i>With tongs</i>. As men use to do.
<i>From off the altar</i>. Where the fire is holy, where there is no strange fire.

From these words I infer that this chapter contains Isaiah’s first prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">He declares that he was before unfit for bearing the message of the Most Holy.</i>

Verse 9

<i>Hear ye, indeed</i>, etc. Some assert that God does not accept the repentance of the sinner, when his earthly punishment is already decreed, to cancel the sentence. R. Moses Hakkohen is of opinion that this passage describes the benefit the people will derive from listening to the good advice of the prophet; that they will be delivered from their afflictions.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">R. Moses Hakkohen explains the verse thus: Listen to the words of the prophet, and you will not suffer any of the threatened evils; but this opinion is rejected by Ibn Ezra on account of the following verse, which is the continuation of this, and leaves no doubt about its meaning; according to his opinion the prophet says, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; it is of no use, because it is too late.</i> This is, however, contradicted by Lest they return and be healed. The first explanation is the right one.

Verse 10

<span>השמן</span> <i>Make fat</i>. According to some it is infinitive, like <span>הקטר</span> To burn incense (1 Sam. 3:16); and <span>הׇשַׁע</span> likewise, like <span>הׇרַע</span> To do evil (Lev. 5:4); but this cannot be so, because of the conjunction <span>פן</span> lest.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since the part beginning with lest is the secondary sentence, the preceding must be the principal one; and <span>השמן ,השע</span>, the verbs of the principal sentence, cannot be Infinitives.</i> They are all rather imperative forms. We know that the prophet cannot make the heart fat; he shall only declare their heart to be so; there are many instances like it.
<span>הׇשַׁע</span> <i>Shut</i>. Comp. <span>תשעינה</span> Will be shut (32:3). In Chaldee, this word <span>שעה</span> has the same meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Lev. 14:42, 43, and the Chaldæan translation.</i> The imperative Hiphil ought to be <span>הֶשֶׁע</span> like <span>הֶרֶף</span>, but the guttural letter <span>ע</span> causes the alteration; the form <span>הָשַׁע</span> can also be derived from a verb <span>(שעע) ע״ע</span>

Verse 11

<i>How long</i>. The prophet wants to know how long this misfortune shall last, that the people shall not understand nor repent. The answer is, Till the land be desolate.

Some explain, the tenth part will be left in the land. Grammatically, <span>עשיריה</span> is an adjective, the tenth; but different from <span>עשירית</span> the tenth part; comp. <span>שלישיה</span> (19:24) the third.

<i>Tails of smoking firebrands</i>. The prophet compares these kings to the tails of firebrands—<span>אודים</span> firebrands comp.

Verse 6

<span>ונקיצנה</span> Transitive verb, let us cause her to be distressed because of us; the suffix <span>נה</span> her, refers to Jerusalem; the following, Let us make a breach therein, proves the correctness of this interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.

<span>טבאל</span> is by a certain interchange of letters the same as <span>רמלא</span>, and <span>בן טבאל</span> therefore the same as <span>בן רמליהו</span>; this is nonsense, because Ben Remaliahu is mentioned before, and he says with Aram, Let us set a king in the midst of it, the son of Tobel. Others say that <span>טָבְאַל</span> means <span>טׂב אֵלֵינוּ</span> good for us, but <span>אַל</span> can only be taken as equal to <span>לא</span>, and <span>בן טבאל</span> would then be <span>בן טבלא ═</span> good for nothing; but I conclude that it is the name of some famous prince in Israel or Aram.

Verse 7

Verse 12

<i>I will not ask</i>, etc. From the answer of the prophet we conclude that the words of Ahaz must be taken in a bad sense: I shall not ask nor shall I try Him, for I know that He cannot do what I should ask Him.

Verse 13

<i>To weary men</i>. To make them tired of a thing which they have tried to accomplish, so that they become unable to continue their efforts.

Verse 14

<i>Therefore the Lord himself</i> etc. Though you do not ask a sign, He will give it you. It is to me a matter of surprise that there are those who say the prophet here refers to Jesus, since the sign was given to Ahaz, and Jesus was born many years afterwards; besides, the prophet says, For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land shall be forsaken; but the countries of Ephraim and Syria were wasted in the sixth year of Hezekiah, and<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The following is added to show that The land shall be forsaken, can only refer to Syria and Israel; both kingdoms were successively conquered by Assyria in the time of Ahaz and Hezekiah.</i> it is distinctly said of whose two kings, etc. Many make the mistake of identifying Immanuel with Hezekiah; they cannot be the same, granting even this prophecy to have been uttered at the beginning of the reign of Ahaz; he reigned only sixteen years, and Hezekiah was at the death of Ahaz twenty-five years old. According to others, Immanuel is another son of Ahaz, and others again take the names (Immanuel, Maher Shalal and Shear Yashub) as symbolical of the kingdom; but if so, what meaning would be in the child’s knowing good and evil and in Maher Shalal calling father and mother? (8:4). I think that Immanuel is the son of Isaiah, as well as Maher Shalal; the latter is proved by And I went unto the prophetess, etc. (8:3). Shear Yashub is similarly related to the prophet (ver. 3); each of the three sons received a name that contained some hint at future events; Immanuel implied that God would help them and be with them during the troubles caused by the two kings; Maher Shalal, that the time for the exile of Samaria had arrived; and Shear Yashub, that the remnant of Israel would repent; this explanation is well borne out by the words, Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for signs and for wonders. Comp. The children which the Lord hath graciously given to thy servant (Gen. 33:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This quotation is to prove that the words, the children which the Lord has given me refer to the true children of the prophet, not to pupils, and that they are not used in any other figurative sense.</i> Those that in the former passage regard children as equivalent to pupils must produce us some analogy from Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">It is hardly necessary to refer to the great many instances, where the listener or reader is addressed as My son, but Ibn Ezra speaks of the whole phrase, children whom the Lord hath given me, and to take that in a figurative sense is not possible without some analogous examples.</i> Isaiah himself was a sign and an example concerning Egypt (20:3).—The Gaon says that the sign consisted in the child being a male child;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This was foretold by the prophet (ver. 14).</i> but in my opinion the sign was that the child was to eat butter and honey; for it is not usual that children eat these things immediately after their birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">If this be the right explanation, the most important point in the sign is omitted from the text, namely, that the child will eat those things <i>immediately</i> after its birth.</i> 
We know that a male child is called <span>נער</span>, a female child <span>נערה</span> or <span>עלמה</span>—the feminine of <span>עֶלֶם</span>—whether she be a virgin or not; for <span>עלמה</span> signifies a person of a certain age, like the masculine <span>עלם</span>; and in <span>דרך גבר בעלמה</span> the way of a man with a young woman<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A.

He bindeth his foal to the vine (Gen. 49:4). The prophet says that from one cow and two sheep there will be obtained a plentiful supply of milk; and the vineyards of the mountains, that will alone remain undamaged, will enjoy a boundless blessing from the Almighty.

The sages burst into tears, but R. Akiba exhibited joy. When they enquired how he could express feelings of gladness at such a sight, he asked them why they wept. What! said they; have we not cause to weep, when we find that the very spot of which the law has said, ‘The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death’ (Num. 18:7), has now become the abode of foxes? (Lam. 5:18.) And for the same reason, returned R. Akiba, do I rejoice. It is written: ‘And I should take for myself faithful witnesses, the priest Uriah, and Zachariah, the son of Berchjah.’ Now, what connection is there between Uriah and Zachariah? The one lived in the time of the first Temple (under Ahaz), the other in the time of the second. No other connection but to show that the prophecy of the one is conditioned by the words of the other. Uriah declared: ‘ For your sake shall Zion be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,’ etc. (Mic. 3:12). Zachariah foretold: ‘There shall yet old men and women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem,’ etc. (Zac. 8:4). As long as Uriah’s words were not fulfilled, one might have doubted the truth of the prophecy of Zachariah; but when I perceive how literally the predictions of the one have been verified, I can entertain no reasonable doubt that the promises of Zachariah will be fulfilled likewise. Thereupon his companions exclaimed, Akiba, thou hast given us true comfort. (Talm. Babli Makkoth, 24).</i>

Verse 5

<i>And the Lord spake again</i>. The word again is used because the following prophecy refers likewise to the invasion of the king of Assyria.

Verse 6

<i>The water of the Shiloah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Shiloah is a rivulet that takes its rise in the north-west of Zion, flowing between Zion and the Upper City, and falling into the Kedron, which runs into the Dead Sea.</i> According to some Jerusalem is referred to by these words, but it is more correct to explain them as indicating the house of David, because the majority of the kings of this house were righteous, but the kings of Israel were all bad and wicked. <span>מי השילח</span>, literally: the canal, the water which is conducted by man, or which causes plants (<span>שלחים</span>) to sprout forth; comp. <span>שלחיך</span> Thy plants (Song 4:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Shiloah, though a proper noun, may still, like all names, be explained like a common noun.

Verse 8

He is mentioned here because he is to serve as a sign that Jerusalem will be delivered out of the hand of Pekah, Rezin and Sennacherib, even after the conquest of Damascus and Samaria.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Assyrian armies could then march directly against Jerusalem, and their success was considered certain.</i>

Verse 9

It is to be connected with <span>לאבן <sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The construction of the phrase, according to I.

Verse 15

<i>By them</i>. By the gin and snare.

Verse 16

<span>צור</span> According to some <span>נ</span> of the root is dropped; <span>נצור ═ צור</span> keep; but more correctly it is explained, Bind up; comp. <span>וצרת</span> And bind up (Deuter. 14:25). <span>צור</span> has, then, the same meaning as in the parallel phrase, <span>חתום</span> seal.—Do not reveal these prophecies, the testimony and the law.

Verse 17

<i>And I will wait</i>. These are the words of the prophet; he will delay revealing the divine message till the Almighty shall give him permission.

Verse 18

<i>Behold, I and the children</i>, etc. They may understand a part of the prophecy entrusted to me from my actions and from the names of my sons. 
<i>From the Lord of hosts</i>, etc. These names were given by the Lord of hosts,

According to some <span>לתורה</span> is an oath, by the law; but we find no analogy to this in Scripture.

Verse 21

<i>And they shall pass through it</i>, etc. Some explain this verse in the following way: Days will come when he that is travelling in Judah, and being himself of the tribe of Judah, will be hardly bestead and hungry through the host of Sennacherib; and when he sees that neither his king nor his idol will help him, then he will turn upwards to pray to God in heaven. I think it refers to the host of Sennacherib when marching through the land of Judah; for when the army is large, it is frequently exposed to hunger. 
<i>Their king;</i> that is, the King of Assyria. 
<i>And look upward</i>. Wherever they will turn, upward or downward, only darkness shall meet them.

Verse 22

Verse 1

<i>The people that walk in darkness</i>. The people of Jerusalem, who in their affliction walk in her streets as if they were blind of both their eyes.

Verse 2

Verse 4

<span>סאון</span>. According to some, this word is related to <span>סאה</span> measure, and the meaning of the whole phrase is, God gave to Assyria the full measure according to her deeds. Some say, that by metathesis <span>סאון</span> is said for <span>אסון</span> mishap;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of the phrase would then be: For every kind of calamity will burst upon them tempestuously.</i> comp. <span>כשב ═ כבש</span> lamb; more correctly it may be said that this word is a hapax legomenon, and from the succeeding <span>סואן</span>, which is a verb (participle Kal), we see that <span>נ</span> is radical; the meaning of <span>סאן</span> is to cry loudly. <sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. does not tell us whence he derived his meaning for this hapax legomenon; very probably, however, from its being connected with <span>ברעש</span>, with confused noise.

<span>ושמלה מגוללה בדמים</span> <i>And garments rolled in blood</i>. Every one lies slain in his blood.

Verse 5

<i>For unto us</i>, etc. All this has come to pass through the merit of the child that is born unto us. We know that at the time of the invasion of Sennacherib, Hezekiah was thirty-nine years old;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he commenced to reign; he was king for twenty-nine years (2 Kings 18:2); fifteen years before his death he fell ill (20:6), and this seems to have happened immediately after the destruction of the Assyrian army.

<span>לסרבה</span> Some remark, after the manner of the Midrash,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><span>פשט</span> and <span>מדרש</span> (simplicity and research), are the two modes of commentary met with in Hebrew Literature; while the former reads and expounds the Scriptural text before us, the latter does not confine itself to this task, but, introducing extraneous historical, philosophical and moral matter, employs the wording of the text as a framework, or simply as a support to the memory. Notice is, therefore, taken even of the shape of the letters if they deviate in any extraordinary way from their customary form; as, <i>e.g.</i>, when a final Mem is found in the middle of a word; as such instances are too striking to be easily forgotten, any lesson which may be attached to them will probably retain a firm hold upon the memory.</i> that the use of the final Mem in this word hints at the miracle of the sun’s shadow going backward (38:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the Yalkut no mention is made of this explanation.

Verse 12

<i>And the people</i>. Namely, Israel. 
<i>Unto him that smiteth them</i>.

Verse 19

<i>And he shall snatch</i>, etc. Figuratively said, referring to the civil wars which they shall wage against each other, though being brethren, and forming, as it were, one body.

Chapter 11



Verse 1

The majority of commentators apply this chapter to the Messiah, as if the prophet said, The Assyrian army, which is now attacking Jerusalem, will perish; but besides this partial deliverance, a time of complete redemption will come for Jerusalem. R. Moses Hakkohen refers the chapter to Hezekiah, on account of its being the continuation of the prophecy recorded in the preceding chapter.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra does not directly decide in favour of either opinion, but tries throughout the chapter to show that both views can be fairly upheld. The connection with the preceding chapter, however, which is to recommend the view of R. Moses Hakkohen, is a very feeble support, since the transition from momentary relief to the lasting Messianic redemption, even in one and the same chapter, would be quite natural.</i>

Verse 3

The rebuking and judging mentioned in this verse are privileges of royalty.

Verse 4

<i>And he will judge the poor with justice</i>. According to the rule, Neither shalt thou countenance the poor in his cause (Exod. 33:3). 
<span>ביושר ═ במישור</span> With equity. <span>לענוי ארץ</span> <i>The meek of the earth</i>. The good.
<i>With the rod of his mouth</i>. With his mouth, which is, as it were, a rod for the wicked.

Verse 5

<i>And righteousness shall be</i>, etc. And uprightness will never depart from him in all his doings.

Verse 6

Verse 9

<i>They shall not hurt</i>, etc. The asp and cockatrice will do no harm, as if all Palestine were full of the knowledge of the Lord; for it is an acknowledged fact, that he who knows the Lord will never destroy, but always build and improve. 
<span>כמים אשר לים מכסים ═ כמים לים מכסים</span> Knowledge will increase, like the water which covers the sea. The water is never stopped, so knowledge will continually make progress.

Verse 4

<span>קול המון</span> <i>A resounding voice</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., The noise of a multitude.</i> It is the nature of mountains to echo the sound of words uttered by any person, and this echo is alluded to by the expression <span>קול המון</span>. The root of <span>המון</span> is <span>המה</span> resound; comp. <span>הומה</span> being in an uproar (1 Kings 1:41). The prophet explains also what this noise among the kingdoms of the heathen people signifies; Cyrus, the king of Persia, and Darius, the king of Media, became allies in a war against Babylon; this is distinctly stated in Daniel.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The passages referred to are : The kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians (Dan. 5:28), And Darius, the Mede, took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old (ib. 6:1.) On the latter verse I. E. remarks, It is known that Cyrus took Babylon, as stated in Isaiah; Cyrus is therefore called the king of Babylon (Ezra 5:13), but Darius the Mede, his father-in-law, was, as we learn from the history of Persia and Media, his ally, and was made by him viceroy of Babylon. They were both kings of Babylon at the same time, but it was by order of Cyrus, the king of kings, that the Jews returned to Jerusalem after the fall of Babylon.</i>

The word <span>מפקד</span> governs two accusatives.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first explanation, <span>מפקד</span> is a denominative from <span>פקיד</span> officer; according to the second it is derived from <span>פקד</span> to number. <span>מפקדים</span> in the Hebrew text is probably a corruption of <span>מגזרת פְּקֻדִים</span>.</i>

Verse 5

<i>They come from a far country</i>. They come from the country of Elam.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Elam mentioned by I.

The remark of I. E. is probably based on Is. 21:2, Go up, Elam, &amp;c. and he seems to suppose that there was, besides the west Persian province Elymais, including Susiana, Dan. 8:2, another Elam or Elymais, an independent state in the north and east of Media and Persia (comp. Jer. 49:34, Ez. 32:24). The Elamites, warlike Semitic tribes (comp. Gen. 14:1, 10:22), had spread over the whole of the country between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, and left here and there traces of their conquests. Hence the Elymais, in the west of Persia, and another Elymais, in the north of Media; hence the great uncertainty and discrepancy among the ancient geographers and historians concerning the extent and position of Elymais. (See Smith’s Dict. of Greek and Rom. Geogr. sub voce Elymais; Niebuhr, Assur and Babel, p. 382, ff.)</i> <i>From the end of heaven</i>.

<span>מוסר</span> <i>Taken away</i>. Comp. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hiphil of <span>סור</span> to depart; <span>מוסר</span> is participle Hophal: caused to depart, or taken away.</i><span>הסיר</span> He took away (18:5). 
<span>דמשק מוסר מעיר</span> Damascus is taken away from being a city. Join <span>מוסר</span> with the feminine noun <span>דמשק</span>, although it has a masculine form. More correctly, however, <span>דמשק</span> may be taken as equal to <span>עם דמשק</span> the people of Damascus,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><span>דמשק מוסר מעיר</span> The people of Damascus will be taken away from the city.</i> especially since in the phrase which follows,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">That phrase undoubtedly refers to the city of Damascus.</i> the feminine <span>והיתה</span> and she will be, is used.
<span>מעי</span> <i>Heap</i>. Comp. <span>לעיים</span> to heaps (Ps. 79:1); the <span>מ</span> is not radical.

Verse 2

<i>The cities</i>, etc. This was caused by the king of Assyria.

Verse 3

<i>The fortress also shall cease</i>, etc. When Sennacherib came, Damascus had been already conquered and also Samaria with its fortresses.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Hebrew text: When Sennacherib came, he took <span>(תפש)</span> Damascus and also Samaria with its fortresses. This is incorrect, for Tiglath Pileser took Damascus in the time of Ahaz (2 Kings 16:7—10), and Shalmaneser conquered Samaria (ibid. 17:9, 10) in the sixth year of King Hezekiah; Sennacherib entered Judah in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah. This incorrectness is probably not the fault of I. E., but that of the copyist; for if we read instead of <span>תפש</span>, the Niphal <span>נתפשה</span>, and translate for when Sennacherib came, Damascus was already conquered, Samaria with its fortresses likewise, we have a better construction of the sentence, and no contradiction of the account given in the Book of Kings. I. E. refers the prophecy of this chapter to the period of the Assyrian invasion under Sennacherib.</i> 
<i>And the remnant of Syria</i>, Damascus was the capital of Syria. <i>They shall be as the glory of the children of Israel</i>, of which it is said, The glory of Jacob shall be made thin (ver. 4). Others explain, And the remnant of Syria will be reduced to so disgraceful a condition, that the condition of the Israelites will be considered glorious, in comparison with the fate of Damascus.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><span>ככבוד בני ישראל</span> is, according to this explanation, to be translated by as if it were a glory for the children of Israel, or nearly a glory, etc. For both significations of the prefix <span>כ</span> a sufficient number of instances can be adduced.</i>

Verse 4

<i>The glory of Israel shall be made thin</i>. The numbers of Israel shall be greatly reduced by slaughter and captivity.

Verse 5

<i>And it shall be</i>, the first time.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. does not here explain the repetition of <span>והיה</span> as a poetical figure; because two different periods are here clearly indicated; the gathering of the standing corn at the beginning of the harvest, and the gathering of the ears from the field at the end of the harvest. The two invasions referred to by I. E. are probably the two principal ones of Tiglath Pileser and Shalmaneser. There were, in fact, other invasions, <i>e.g.</i>, that of King Phul.</i>
<span>כאסף קציר</span> <i>As when the harvestman gathereth the corn</i>. <span>הקוצר</span> the harvestman, must be supplied before <span>קציר</span>. 
<i>And it shall be</i>, the second time. The king of Assyria came twice against the land of Israel. 
<i>In the valley of Rephaim</i>. A place where the harvest was bad, thin and meagre.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The valley Rephaim is here declared to be a barren valley; it is not certain whether I. E. derives this explanation from the meaning of the word <span>רפה═רפא</span> to be weak, or from some other source.</i>

Verse 6

<span>כנוקף</span> <i>As the shaking of</i>. Comp. <span>ונקף</span> and he will cut down (10:34); <span>ינקופו</span> let them kill (29:1).
<span>אמיר</span> <i>The top of the olive-tree</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., The uppermost bough.</i> Comp. <span>האמירך</span> He hath exalted thee (Deut. 26:18); the word <span>אמיר</span> has the same meaning in Arabic.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">أَمِير chief. Comp. Sephath Yether 47.</i> 
<i>Four or five</i>. Supply berries.
<span>בסעיפיה פוריה</span> In the branches of the fruitful olive-tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><span>פוריה</span> is not an attribute to <span>סעיפיה</span>, because it is feminine, while <span>סעיף</span> branch is masculine, but to the noun referred to by the pronoun <span>הָ</span> her, that is, the olive tree. <span>בסעיפיה פוריה</span> means accordingly, In the branches of her that is fruitful. A. V., In the outmost fruitful branches thereof.</i>

Verse 7

<span>ישעה האדם על עשהו</span> <i>Shall a man look to his maker</i>. Man will renounce his own powers, because of the Lord, and this is the true confidence in God (comp. 2 Sam. 22:42).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It is remarkable that I. E. makes a similar remark on all passages where the verb <span>שעה</span> occurs, (comp. 22:4, 31:1, Ex. 5:9), as if he wished to show that they have all the same fundamental meaning, while according to R. Jehudah Hayug this root comprises four meanings. See Two Treatises, etc., ed. John W. Nutt, pp. 97, 113.</i> 
<i>And his eyes shall see</i>, etc. They shall no more see the worship of idols, for they will only visit places sanctified to the worship of the Lord.

Verse 8

<span>והחמנים</span> <i>Nor the images of the sun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Nor the images.</i> The <span>נ</span> is not radical; comp. <span>רחמניות</span> merciful (Lam. 4:10). <span>חמנים</span> are images made like chariots in honour of the sun <span>(חַמָּה)</span> as stated in the history of King Manasseh (2 Kings 21:3)

Verse 9

<i>His strong cities</i>. The strong cities of Israel.
<span>החרש</span> <i>The tree</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Bough.</i> Comp. Ezek. 31:3. 
<span>והאמיר</span> And the uppermost branch. They abandoned everything, the root and the branches, in their flight, when the Israelites entered the land of Canaan. 
<i>They left</i>. By the pronoun they the Canaanites are meant.
<i>And she shall be desolate</i>. The prophet speaks here of Samaria, for she was the capital of the kingdom of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This remark is caused by the change of the number from the plural in <span>ערי מעזו</span> his strong cities, to the singular in <span>והיתה</span> And she shall be.</i>

Verse 10

<i>Because thou hast forgotten</i>, etc. The prophet turns now to the people of Samaria, and rebukes them. 
<span>נעמנים</span> The same as in Arabic; a plant that grows quickly.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">نَعِمَ to flourish. A. V., pleasant.</i> <span>זר</span> means likewise growing quickly. <span>וזמורת שורק זר ═ וזמורת זר</span> And a branch of a thriving vine-tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., With strange slips.</i>

Verse 11

<span>תשגשגי</span> <i>Thou shalt make to grow</i>. Root <span>שנא</span> to be large; comp. <span>שניא</span> great. Thou shalt make it to grow quickly. <i>And in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish</i>. The same. As a general rule for the understanding of the prophetical books, I say, that from the one part of the verse we can infer what the words of the other part signify.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is a very important rule, and if applied with propriety as it is by I. E., one which affords much assistance in finding the true sense of a verse.</i> 
<span>נד</span> There will depart.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Shall be a heap.</i> <span>קציר</span> <i>The branch</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., The harvest.</i> Comp. <span>בקצירי</span> in my branch (Job 29:19)
<span>נחלה</span> <i>Sore</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Grief</i> Supply <span>מכה</span> plague, to which the word is an attribute <span>(מכה נחלה ═ נחלה)</span>, a sore plague; comp. <span>בריאה ומאכלו</span> and their meat plenteous (Hab. 1:16) ═ <span>בריאה ומאכלו אכילה</span>.<span><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The assumption of the ellipsis of <span>מכה</span> plague, is based on the difference in respect to the genders of the noun <span>יום</span> (masc.), and the adjective <span>נחלה</span> (fem.); the same is the case in <span>ומאכלו בריאה</span>, which is explained by I. E. to be equal to <span>ומאכלו אכילה בריאה</span>.</i></span> This explanation is supported by the words which follow: <span>וכאב אנוש</span> and of desperate sorrow; with <span>אנוש</span> con-connect <span>ויאנש</span> and it was very sick (2 Sam. 12:15). Thou hast a great many children, but when the day of affliction shall come they will all perish.

Verse 12

<i>Woe to the multitude of many people</i>, that is, to the king of Assyria and his army, coming against Zion.
<span>ישאון</span> <i>That make a rushing</i>. It is of the same root <span>(שאה)</span> as <span>שאון</span> noise. The <span>נ</span> in <span>שאון</span> is not radical;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Root <span>שאה</span> to rush.</i> the form of the noun is like that of <span>זדון</span> pride (Prov. 11:2)

Verse 13

<i>But He shall rebuke him</i>. God will rebuke the king of Assyria.
<i>From far off</i>. That is, far from his own land. 
<i>And shall be chased</i>. The part of the army that will be left will be pursued.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This is not quite in accordance with the words of the account given by Isaiah 37:36, unless the expression all of them (ibid.) be taken as a hyperbole.</i>

Verse 14

<i>At eveningtide</i>, that is, when the inhabitants of Jerusalem are afraid of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">By this remark, I. E. meant perhaps to say that eventide is to be considered as a figurative expression, signifying distress, anxiety.</i>
<span>בלהה</span> <i>Trouble</i>. Comp. <span>בלהות</span> terror (Ez. 26:21); <span>בהלה ═ בלהה</span> like <span>כבש ═ כשב</span> lamb.
<i>And he is not</i>. When the angel will have come forth and destroyed the greater part<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This is not quite in accordance with the words of the account given by Isaiah 37:36, unless the expression all of them (ibid.) be taken as a hyperbole.</i> of the camp. 
<i>This is the portion of them that spoil us</i>. These are the words of the prophet in his rejoicing.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See c. xvi., note 27.</i>

Chapter 18



Verse 1

<span>הדי</span> <i>Oh !</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Woe. See I. E. on 1:4, and c. i., note 13.</i> It is the sign of the vocative case. Comp. Zac. 2:10.
<span>צלצל</span> <i>Shadowing</i>. Reduplication of <span>צל</span> shadow. A shady land is identical with a wide land.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The idea of connecting shady with wide, is probably suggested by the image of a shady tree, whose branches extend over a large area.</i> 
<i>Which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia</i>. That is, beyond the rivers of the kingdom of Assyria.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ethiopia (Kush) is here identified with Assyria. I. E. on Gen. 10:11 seems to deny the connection between Ethiopia and Assyria, and to consider Asshur (═Assyria) as a son of Japheth or Shem, but not as a descendant of Kush (Ethiopia) or Ham. See c. xlii. Note 1.</i>

Verse 2

<i>That sendeth</i>, etc. That is accustomed to send messengers over the sea. 
<i>Go</i>, <i>ye swift messengers</i>, and bring good tidings to the Israelites, that are fled or are driven into exile, and are now beyond the rivers of Ethiopia. 
<i>And in vessels of bulrushes</i>. This phrase is added because of the rivers mentioned before,
<span>גוי ממשך ומורט</span> <i>A nation dragged and peeled</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Scattered and peeled.</i> The Israelites are meant, that have been dragged from their homes like sheep, until they were flayed from the dragging. 
<i>To a terrible people</i>. To the Ethiopians.
<span>מן הוא</span> <i>From thence</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., From their beginning.</i> From that people, or from those rivers.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><span>ממֶּנּוּ ═ מן הוּא</span>. The pronoun is sometimes written in full, instead of a suffix. That I. E., who is always very particular about the gender and number should have found in the singular <span>הוא</span> a reference to the plural <span>נהרי</span> rivers, is very strange. Instead of <span>נהרי</span> we have perhaps to read <span>עֵבֶר נהרי</span></i>
<span>גוי קו קו</span> <i>A nation of line by line</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., A nation meted out.</i> A nation whose intellect is like that of a child, who is taught gradually, line by line. <span>ומבוסה</span> And therefore it is trodden down.
<span>בזאו</span> <i>They have spoiled</i>. <span>א</span> is to replace the second <span>ז</span> of the root which is omitted; comp. <span>דליו</span> they are thin<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Root <span>דלל</span> to be poor. <span>דללו ═ דליו</span> as <span>בזזו ═ בואו</span>.<br>8a I.

This is the explanation of R. Moses Hakkohen. 
<i>Rivers</i>. This is a figure for kings; comp. The water of the river<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">To this phrase Isaiah adds the explanation: The king of Assyria.</i> (8:7)

Verse 3

<i>All ye inhabitants of the world</i>. As if a banner were raised over the whole earth.
<i>You shall hear</i>, so as to know the work of the Lord, which He has done in the camp of Sennacherib.

Verse 4

<i>I will take my rest</i>. This refers to the divine glory<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In order to remove the anthropomorphism, God takes rest, I. E. substitutes for God, or the pronoun referring to Him, the word <span>שכינה</span> (lit. dwelling,) the divine glory revealed in His works. This divine glory, he says, remained in Jerusalem, that is, revealed itself in the deliverance of the holy city from the threatened humiliation by Sennacherib.</i> which remained. 
<span>ואביטה</span> And I shall see.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">What I. E. means to say by this remark can hardly be discovered, unless we suppose that he read <span>מכוני</span> instead of <span>במכוני</span>—the word is quoted by I. E. without <span>ב</span>—and explained by this remark, the exceptional construction of the verb <span>הביט</span> with a noun without the preposition <span>ב</span>; he says that it has the meaning of <span>ראה</span> to see, which governs the accusative.</i>
<span>מכוני</span> <i>My dwelling-place</i>, Jerusalem. 
<span>אויר צח ═ צח</span> Pure air.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">According to I. E. the words <span>כחם צח אלי אור</span>, must be rendered when the pure air is warm after the rain. A. V., Like a clear heat upon herbs.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">According to I. E. the words <span>כחם צח אלי אור</span>, must be rendered when the pure air is warm after the rain. A. V., Like a clear heat upon herbs.</i>
<span>עלי אור</span> <i>After rain</i>. Comp. <span>ענן אורו</span> the cloud of his rain<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., His bright cloud.</i> (Job 37:11). The sun is also called <span>אור</span>, the moon too,—comp. <span>אורים גדולים</span> great luminaries<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Sun and moon.</i> (Ps. 136:7)—because they are the cause of the rain,<sup class="footnote-marker">14a</sup><i class="footnote">The same remark is made by I.E. in Gen. 2:6.</i> but of course only at the will of the Almighty.

Verse 5


<span>גומל</span> <i>Ripening</i>, Comp. <span>ויגמל</span> And it ripened (Num. 17:23). <span>יהיה נצה</span> Will still be in the flower. 
<i>And He will cut off</i>. The pronoun refers to God.
<span>הזלזלים</span> <i>The sprigs</i>. The branches which are joined to the root; the word is hap. leg.
<span>הנטישות</span> The large branches, that spread <span>(נטש)</span> widely. 
<span>כרת ═ התז</span> He cut. This verb is often met with in Rabbinical Hebrew.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Talmud Babli. Gittin 70a, Synhedrin, 52b.</i> The two verbs in the past follow each other without a conjunction, like <span>חמק עבר</span> Hath gone, passed by (Song 5:6). The meaning of the verse is: The Assyrians will perish before the fruit of their devices will be ripe.

Verse 6

<i>They will be left</i>, etc. The host of Assyria, having been destroyed through the angel, will be left, etc.
<span>לעיט</span> <i>To the fowl</i> (comp. Gen. 15:11); its forms are like those of <span>שֵׁשׁ</span> (Est. 1:6), and <span>שַׁיִשׁ</span> <span>(1</span> Chron. 29:2), marble.
<span>וקץ</span> <i>And shall summer</i>. Comp. <span>קיץ</span> summer (Gen. 8:22).
<span>תחרף</span> <i>Shall winter</i>. Comp. <span>הֹרֶף</span> winter (Gen. 8:22).—The beasts will remain there to eat the corpses of the killed.

Verse 7

<span>שי</span> <i>Present</i>. Comp. Ps. 76:12.
<i>A people dragged and peeled</i>. Israel, who has been dragged and flayed during the period of his captivity, will now be brought, to the honour of God, to His abode on Mount Zion. According to R. Moses Hakkohen, this chapter describes the redemption announced by the words—The Lord shall set His hand again the second time to recover the remnant of the people, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This verse describes, according to R. Moses Hakkohen, the deliverance of the Israelites in the time of Hezekiah. Comp. I. E. on 11:11.</i> (11:11.

Chapter 19



Verse 1

<i>The Lord rideth upon a swift cloud</i>. This figure signifies the imminent fulfilment of the divine decrees.

Verse 2

<span>וסכסכתי</span> <i>And I will set</i>. Comp. <span>יסכסך</span> He will set up (9:10)

Verse 3

<span>ונבקה</span> <i>And shall fail</i>. Root <span>בקק</span> to empty. Comp. <span>בוקק</span> maketh empty (24:1). <span>נבקה</span> is Niphal of <span>בקק</span>, and is formed like <span>נסבה</span> and it will be wound about<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The regular form of the Niphal third person fem. sing. past of <span>בקק</span> and <span>סבב</span> is <span>נָסַבָּה נָבַקָּה</span>, but the reduplication is very often neglected in the verbs <span>עיע</span>.

<span>אטים</span> <i>Charmers</i>. Comp. <span>אט</span> softly (1 Kings 21:27); <span>אטים</span> signifies things that are done secretly.

Verse 4

<span>וסכרתי</span> <i>And I will give over</i>. The <span>כ</span> is here, according to some, substituted for <span>נ</span>, but, in fact, only the silent letters interchange; it is rather to be compared with <span>ויסכרו</span> and were stopped<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The second explanation is not different from the first in substance, but in the wording, because after all <span>סכר</span> means the same as <span>סגר</span> to shut, to stop, to deliver up, whether we say that the former is derived from the latter by the change of <span>ג</span> into <span>כ</span> or not.</i> (Gen. 8:2).
<span>אדנים קשה</span> <i>A cruel lord</i>. The grammatical irregularity is already explained (Ex. 21:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">On Exod. 21:4, I.

<i>And a fierce king</i>. The king of Assyria.

Verse 5

<span>ונשתו</span> <i>And shall be dried up</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., And shall fail, faileth.</i> Comp. <span>לשונם בצמא נשתה</span> their tongue is dry for thirst (41:17)

Verse 6

<span>והאזניחו</span> <i>And shall leave.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A.

<span>קמלו</span> <i>Shall be cut off</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Shall wither.</i> Another instance of the same root occurs in this book (33:9)

Verse 7

Verse 8

<span>ואנו</span> And they shall mourn.
<span>הדיגים</span> <i>The fishers</i>. A noun analogous to <span>גַּנָּבִים</span> thieves (1:23).
<span>חכה</span> <i>Angle</i>. Comp. <span>בחכה</span> with an angle (Hab. 1:15), an instrument by which the fish are caught. Many derive the word from <span>חֵךְ</span> palate, but they are far from being right.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. does not show, why he rejects this derivation; it seems rather probable that <span>חכה</span> angle is derived from <span>חֵךְ</span> palate, because the hook takes hold of the fish in the palate.</i> 
<span>מכמרת</span> Net.

Verse 9

<span>שריקות</span> <i>Red</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Fire.</i> Some compare it with <span>משרק</span> comb, but more correctly it is derived from <span>שורק</span> vine branch (5:2), and it signifies, having the colour of the vine branch, red; comp. <span>שרקים</span> red (Zac. 1:8). 
<span>חורי</span> It is either an adjective, meaning white,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Net-works.</i> or a noun, signifying fine things, <span>חוֹרָי</span> being a plural form used instead of <span>חורים</span>; comp. <span>חוֹרֵי</span> the nobles of (Jer. 27:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As the Hebrew text stands <span>וכמוהו חוֹרֵי יהודה</span>, it is not clear what this instance is to prove; the regular construct state <span>חוֹרֵי</span> does not contribute anything to the explanation of the irregular form <span>חוֹרָי</span>. The text seems to be incorrect; after <span>כמוהו</span> some instance like <span>חַלוֹנָי</span> windows (Jer. 22:17), or <span>נּוֹבַי</span> grasshoppers (Am. 12:1) is expected, and instead of <span>חורי יהודה</span> we should perhaps read <span>בהראות היו״ד</span> the <span>י</span> being sounded.

Verse 10

<span>שתותיה</span> <i>Her foundations</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., In the purposes thereof.</i> Comp. Ps. 11:3. The buildings which they erect to take the fish in.
<span>שכר</span> <i>Sluices</i>. Comp. <span>ויסכרו</span> and they were stopped (Gen. 8:2), although <span>שכר</span> is spelt with <span>שֹ</span>; comp. <span>בסורי ═ בשורי</span> when I depart (Hos. 9:12).
<span>אנמי נפש</span> <i>The ponds for fish</i>. Ponds containing the lives <span>(נפש)</span> of the fish.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This explanation is against the accents, which require <span>שכר</span> rather to be joined to <span>עשי</span> than to the following word. According to I.

Verse 12

<i>Where are thy wise men</i>, etc. If they in reality be the sons of wise men, of royal family, why do they not know what God has decided for Egypt.

Verse 15

<i>Head or tail</i>. Even a plant in its integrity, with head and tail, will not be left to them. Others take the phrase and explain it figuratively, They are wandering about and do not know what to begin; they can do neither the work of the head, of the old and noble (9:14), nor that of the tail, of the common people. In the same way the phrase, palm-tree and reed, is to be explained.

Verse 16

<i>And it shall be afraid</i>, etc. When the Egyptians shall have heard these decrees of the Lord, and also witnessed their fulfilment, they will fear the Lord.

E. hesitates to give this attribute to the Israelites, as if the Assyrians and Egyptians were superior to them, and explains therefore <span>שלישיה</span> a third in the alliance with Egypt and Assyria.</i> More naturally it is derived from <span>שלשה</span> three, and explained by the third; for there will be in Assyria people that will know the Lord, and many more so in Egypt; and Israel will be a blessing in the midst of the land, for through him Egypt and part of Assyria will know the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. next verse.</i>

<i>My people</i>. Because they will erect an altar to the Lord publicly, He calls them my people. 
<i>And the work of my hands</i> (and not my people), for there will be only a few of them that will know the work of the Lord. 
<i>And mine inheritance</i>. Israel remains His inheritance for ever, for Assyria and Egypt are this only temporarily in comparison with Israel. The Chaldæan translation renders this passage thus: Blessed be my people that is in Egypt.

Verse 2

<i>And loose the sackcloth</i>, etc. This shows that the prophet wore sackcloth. It would be a strange thing that the prophet should have gone naked, as a sign for Egypt. I shall explain this circumstance, with the help of the Lord, at the beginning of the minor prophets (Hos. 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.

<i>All the sighing thereof have I made to cease</i>. Some explain, None will be left that should sigh for Babylon; others, All the sighing she has caused, has ceased. I think that the whole passage, from the beginning of this verse<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The text has the words <span>מתחלת כל אנחתה</span>, from the beginning of ‘All sighing thereof;’ but if I.

E. says distinctly in giving the context, that the preceding words were also spoken by Belshazzar. The translation is based on the conjecture, that the original copy had the words <span>מתחלת הפסוק</span> from the beginning of the verse, instead of <span>מתחלת כל אנחתה</span>, from the beginning of ‘ All the sighing thereof.’—I. E. seems to have read <span>אַנְחָתָהּ</span> with a Dagesh.</i> till the end of the chapter, is the speech which the prophet put into the mouth of King Belshazzar; for it is well known that the prophet rejoiced in the fall of Babylon; how, then, could he have said, Therefore are my loins filled with pain (ver. 3)? The connection is as follows: the king says, When I heard the cry, ‘ Go up, O Elam ‘—the soldiers used to call out in battle the name of their country—I made all her sighing cease with musical instruments; the vessels of the house of the Lord were brought, and they<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has <span>ושתה</span>, And he drank; but this is probably a part of the speech of Belshazzar, since it is continued even in the next verse, and it explains how Belshazzar made the sighing of Babylon cease; not only by music, but also by drinking, and using for this purpose the holy vessels of the Temple of Jerusalem; instead of <span>ושתה</span>, the plural <span>ושתו</span> is to be read.</i> drank out of them, while Babylon was in siege and distress.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Comp.

E., two meanings, (1) to boast, (2) to terrify. For the first, however, there is no authority; the instance of <span>מפלצתה</span> proves nothing; it means, as may be seen from the context, her idol, the object of her fear, so that all meanings of this root can be derived from the same origin, <span>פלץ</span> to terrify.</i> 
<i>The night of my pleasure</i>. The night in which he drank out of the holy vessels. <i>Hath he turned, into fear unto me</i>. Belshazzar was frightened when Daniel read to him the miraculous writing (Dan. 5:3)

Verse 5

<i>Arise ye princes, and anoint the shield</i>. For Belshazzar was killed that same night, and Darius, the old, was anointed king. The king is called shield, <span>מָגֵז</span>, because he protects the people; comp. Behold, O Lord, our shield<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Our shield is not in apposition to O Lord; it is the objective case, governed by the imperative behold, and refers to the same person as the face of our anointed in the second half of the verse. The words Arise, etc., are according to this interpretation, no longer the words of Belshazzar, but the words of the prophet addressed to the princes of Babylon.</i> (Ps. 84:10)

Verse 6

<i>For thus hath the Lord said unto me</i>. These are the words of the prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This remark should have been made before, on the preceding verse, but it is probably given here, in order to explain at the same time, that the first person in unto me, refers to the prophet.</i>

And every one of them answered,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The use of the singular in <span>ויען</span>, And he answered, after the plural chariots of men, etc., is explained by assuming the identity of the plural they, and the singular, every one of them.

<i>Babylon is fallen</i>, <i>is fallen</i>. The repetition indicates that no remnant has been left to her.

Verse 10

<i>My threshing</i>. Babylon is the object of threshing; the pronoun my refers to God, to the prophet, or to the chariot of men. The meaning of the phrase is: I also threshed it, and it has become like ‘ the corn of my floor.’ It is also possible that <span>בן גרן</span> signifies the pure corn that is kept in the threshing-floor, and refers figuratively to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first explanation, Babylon is to be understood by the expression My threshing and the com of my floor; according to the second, it signifies Babylon and Israel.</i>

Verse 11

<i>Dumah</i>. Comp. Gen. 25:18.
<i>He calleth to me</i>. The prophet here represents Dumah as speaking, and we have to imagine a spy coming from Seir to search Dumah; he asks the watchman, Watchman, tell me, what is the time of the night, what is the time of the night? just as one of the people of Dumah would ask who had to rise early for a journey, or for work in the field, as is usual in a great many places. The repetition indicates that he asks several men. I, however, think that this question is put to see whether the watchmen sleep.
<span>מליל</span> <i>Of the night</i>.

I. E. himself, repeatedly recommends the rule, that the form of the noun is subject to variation, and the application of this rule in the case of <span>מִלִּיִל</span> is supported by the parallelism; <span>מַה מִלַּיְלָה</span> in the first part appears to have the same meaning as <span>מַה מִלֵּיל</span> in the second part.</i> like <span>בייז חלבון</span> in the good wine of<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

<i>The valley of vision</i>. Jerusalem, the centre of all prophecies. 
<i>Thou art wholly gone up to the house-tops</i>. Some think, they went up in order to offer incense to the host of heaven, but my opinion is, that they went up in order to see the force that besieged Jerusalem, as is generally done under such circumstances.

Verse 2

<span>תשואות</span> <i>Stirs</i>. Root <span>שאה</span> to stir; comp. <span>שאון</span> noise (13:4).
<span>עליזה</span> <i>Joyous</i>.—Jerusalem had been full of men, but they were smitten with captivity and famine, and could not fight.

Verse 3

<span>מקשת אסרו</span> <i>Because of the bow they were bound</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., They are bound by the archers.</i> When they saw the bow of the enemy, they surrendered out of fear, and became prisoners.

Verse 4

<i>Therefore said I</i>. The first person refers to the prophet.

<span>ומבוכה</span> <i>And of perplexity</i>. Comp. <span>נבוכים</span> entangled (Ex. 14:3).
<span>מקרקר</span> overthrowing, or pulling down, derived from <span>קיר</span> wall, with a negative sense; comp. <span>ושרשך</span>, and he will take away thy root (Ps. 52:7), derived from <span>שרש</span> root.
<span>ושוע אל ההר</span> <i>And of crying to the mountains</i>.

The second explanation takes <span>שוע</span> in its usual meaning to cry: Their cry will be so loud that it will reach the mountains, that are far away.</i>

Verse 6

<i>And Elam</i>, etc. In the following the prophet predicts the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. refers this prophecy to Nebuchadnezzar, and not to Sennacherib; because the siege described here, is to end in the fall of Jerusalem (ver. 14 ); this was in fact the result of the siege of Nebuchadnezzar, while Sennacherib was, by a miraculous destruction of his army, compelled to leave Palestine altogether.</i> <i>Elam</i>. Even Elam, that was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is perhaps based on Jer. 25:25, 49:34 ff., where the collapse of the power of Elam is predicted; and Ezek. 32:24-25, where the extinction of the power of Elam is mentioned as an accomplished fact. Elam, according to I. E., conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, might be expected to refuse to join him in an expedition against Palestine.<br>7 The Hebrew text has the words <span>אפילו שחם בעלי מדינות</span> though they are in possession of provinces; they have no sense; for why should the inhabitants of Kir in that case not join Nebuchadnezzar? even if we join the following <span>קיר</span> with this phrase: though they are in possession of the provinces of Kir, it is impossible to find any sense in it. If, however, we add <span>רחוקות</span> distant, as is done in the translation, all difficulty is at once removed. <span>קיר אפילו שהם בעלי מדינות רחוקות</span> even Kir, that is a distant country, or, even the inhabitants of Kir, that live in distant countries, and must find an expedition against Jerusalem very hard and troublesome, etc.</i> was to take up arms against Jerusalem. 
<i>And Kir</i>, though being far from Jerusalem;—comp.

<i>They prepare</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., They set themselves in array.</i> the forts, the trenches, and all the instruments of war.

Verse 8

<i>And he discovered</i>, etc. The veil was already taken away from the eyes of Judah, when the enemy was approaching; they saw immediately that they had no strength to resist. The third person <span>ויגל</span>, And he discovered might also be referred to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first explanation, the enemy is the subject; the enemy, by his approach, opened the eyes of Judah, and made them discover their weakness.</i> 
<i>And thou didst look</i>. Judah is addressed.

Verse 9

<i>Ye have seen also</i>, etc. They looked to the fortifications, and found that the breaches of the town of David were many; they were therefore obliged to collect the waters of the pool, that they might serve as a fence round the town.

Verse 10

<i>And ye have numbered</i>, etc. They had to count the houses, in order to know the number of the soldiers.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It was desirable to know the number of the houses, in order to ascertain how many soldiers the town might be able to keep.</i>

Verse 11

<span>ומקוה</span> <i>And a ditch</i>. <span>מקוה מים ═ מקוה</span> A gathering of water (Lev. 2:36).
<i>Unto the maker thereof</i>. Unto God, who has decreed to bring Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem.

Verse 12

<i>And in that day did the Lord</i>, <i>God of Hosts, call</i>, etc. That is, God decreed. More correctly, however, this phrase may be referred to the words of the prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of the phrase is therefore, And the prophet, in the name of God, declared.</i>

Verse 13

<span>הרג</span> <i>Slaying</i>, causing the separation of the soul from the body; <span>הרג</span> is used with reference to cattle instead of <span>שחט</span>, and on the other side <span>וישחטם</span>, And he slaughtered them (Num. 14:16) is used with reference to men instead of <span><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><span>הרג</span> to slay, is used with reference to man, <span>שחט</span> to kill, with reference to beasts; this passage, and the one quoted from Num. 14:16, are of the exceptions, the entire number of which is very small.</i>.ויהרגם</span> 
<i>For to-morrow we shall die</i>. The prophet foretells what people will say in the days of the siege.

Verse 15

<i>God of hosts</i>.

It can hardily be understood why I.E. transfers this catastrophe to a later period and takes Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, for the son of that Hilkiah, who officiated as high priest during the reign of king Josiah, while the text seems to point at the reign of Hezekiah (comp. 36:22), unless we assume that he is anxious to refer the second part of the chapter to the same period, to which, as he believed, the first part alluded. (Comp. ver. 6).</i>&lt;
<i>There shalt thou die</i>, etc. There he shall die, with all his horsemen. <i>The shame of thy lord’s house</i>.

And I will call my servant Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah (ver. 20)

Verse 19



Verse 20

<i>To my servant</i>. He was the servant of the Lord; not so Shebna.

Verse 21

<i>Thy robe and thy girdle</i>. Every officer has a certain robe and girdle, as <i>e.g.</i>, the wise men of Athens wore a certain distinctive girdle. 
<i>A father</i>. A good teacher and a friend, like a father.

Verse 22

<i>And the king of the house of David</i>, etc. From this verse we learn that the house (ver. 15) means the royal palace.

Verse 23

<span>יתד</span> <i>As a nail</i>. <span>כיתד ═ יתד</span>. Comp. <span>וכעיר ═ ועיר</span> And like a wild ass (Job 11:12)

<span>הצאצאים</span> <i>The offspring</i>. The children that will come out of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The root of <span>צאצאים</span> is <span>יצא</span> to come out.</i>

A joke at the expense of women is perhaps intended by this remark. The real reason for this explanation is very likely to be found in the masculine and feminine terminations of the two words <span>צאצאים</span> and <span>צפיעות</span>.</i> Since he is said to be the father, the men of Judah are as it were his sons, and the women his daughters. <i>All vessels of small quantity</i>. The children are compared to small vessels.

Verse 1

<i>Tyre</i>. A town near the sea; it was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Tyre was besieged five years by Shalmaneser, about 720 <small>B.C.</small> (Joseph. Antiq. 9:14), and thirteen years by Nebuchadnezzar, 583—570 <i>(ib</i>. 10:11). As to the first siege, it is distinctly stated by Josephus that it was not successful; the result of the second is not mentioned, and some infer from Ez. 29:18, that Nebuchadnezzar did not conquer Tyre. But whether conquered or not, the distress and misery which so long a siege must have entailed upon the inhabitants of Tyre, the loss they sustained in wealth and territories, fully corresponds with the humiliation predicted by Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. I. E. refers this chapter to the second and not to the first siege, very likely because the Chaldæans are mentioned in it, according to his interpretation, as the conquerors of Assyria (ver. 13).</i>
<span>כי שרר מבית מבוא</span> <i>For it is laid waste</i>, <i>that there is no house</i>, <i>no entering in</i>. For every house in Tyre is destroyed, that no merchants come there any more. 
<i>From the land of Chittim</i>. Even from the land of Chittim, which is very far,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Chittim is probably Cittium in the isle of Cyprus, which belonged to Phoenicia.</i> this destruction was announced to the ships of Tarshish.

The quotation from Num. 24:25, And ships from the coast of Chittim, is only to prove that Chittim was a naval power.</i> Comp. (Num. 24:25)

Verse 2

<i>Inhabitants of the isle</i>. Inhabitants of Tyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There were two towns of this name, one on the continent, Old Tyre, the other on an island at a short distance from the former.</i> <i>Whom the merchants of Zidon</i>, etc. Although Tyre was full of merchants from Zidon, etc. <i>Zidon</i>. A town likewise on the sea; comp. Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea, etc., and his border shall be unto Zidon (Gen. 49:13)

Verse 3

<i>And by great waters</i>, etc. The merchants brought to Tyre the seed of the Sihor,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Sihor <span>(שיחור)</span> is another name for the Nile <span>(יאֹר)</span>; lit., the black river.

<span>סחר</span> <i>A mart</i>. <span>סחר</span> is a noun and means merchandise; but we have here to supply <span>בעלת</span>; And she was the mistress of the merchandise (that is, the mart) of the nations. Comp. <span>ובעל חסרון ═ וחסרון</span> That which is wanting (Eccl. 1:15)

Verse 4

<i>The sea</i>. She that had the greatest power on the sea, that is Tyre. <i>I travailed not</i>, etc. It is as if there were no people in the isle of Tyre.

Verse 5

<i>And at the report</i>, etc. As at the report of the defeat of Egypt every one was startled, so they will be startled at the report of the fall of Tyre.

Verse 6

<span>אל תרשיש ═ תרשישה</span> To Tarshish.
<span>כל אי ═ אי</span> Every island.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. mentions no reason why <span>אי</span> in ver. 4 alludes to Tyre, and here to the islands generally; perhaps because the next verse addressing the inhabitants of the island in the second person, alludes to Tyre in the third.</i>

Verse 7

<i>Is this your joyous city</i>, etc. Is this Tyre, that was a rejoicing to you—Comp. a rejoicing to the whole land (Ps. 48:3)—that old Tyre, that must now see her people go far away into captivity.

Verse 8

<span>המעטירה</span> <i>The crowning city</i>. That was a glory to the islands.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><span>מעטירה</span> is part. Hiphil, and means lit;: giving a crown, or giving glory.</i>

<span>מזח</span> <i>Strength</i>. Literally, girdle. (Comp. Ps. 109:19). It is used as a figure for strength, because a girdle supports the loins.

Verse 11

<i>He stretched out His hand</i>. God stretched out His hand, that is, He brought the punishment.

<span>בחוניו</span> <i>The towers thereof</i>. Comp. <span>בוחן</span> tower (32:14). More correctly, the suffix in <span>בחוניו</span> refers to the people of the Chaldæans: when they, viz., the Chaldæans, set up their towers of siege. <span>עוררו</span> <i>They raised up</i>. It is a transitive verb. <i>The palaces thereof</i>. It was as if the towers stirred up the palaces, but before they awoke, <i>he brought her to ruin</i>, that is, the Chaldæan brought Assyria to ruin.

<i>Shall Tyre sing as an harlot</i>. Tyre will again be active in words and deeds.

Verse 16

<i>Take up an harp</i>, <i>etc</i>. The forgotten harlot walks about the city playing, that she may be remembered again; thus Tyre will send letters to all her neighbours, that the merchants may again come to her as before.

Verse 17

<i>And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years</i>, when that aforementioned time will come.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. means to say that the seventy years mentioned in this verse are no addition to those given in ver. 15, but are the same.</i>

<i>And shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms</i>. They will come to her for merchandise.

Verse 18

<i>And her merchandise</i>, <i>etc</i>. Of her profits she will sanctify a part to the Lord.

Some ask, How can the prophet promise that the hire of the harlot Tyre will be sanctified to the Lord, since the Law prohibits the hire of an harlot to be brought to the house of the Lord? (Deut. 23:19). The reply to this question is, that the Law prohibits the real hire of an harlot, but the prophet uses the words, her hire, in a figurative sense; in reality, he does not speak of an harlot at all.

Verse 22

<span>באסיר ═ אסיר</span> As a prisoner. <i>As prisoners are gathered, etc</i>. As people who are brought to the prison to be shut in are often left there for a long time before they are visited to be supplied with their food.

Verse 23

<i>Then the moon</i>, etc. Sun and moon, the rulers of heaven, are used here in a figurative sense for the kings of the earth, who will be ashamed; but it is also possible that an eclipse of sun and moon is meant by the prophet. The kingdom of God will then appear on the mount of Zion, and honour will be given to those that remain faithful to God. According to others this passage refers to the worshippers of the heavenly bodies; but this explanation is at variance with the context.

Verse 8

The more Thou hast chastised Thy people, the more they acknowledged Thy glory, even when exiled from their country.

Verse 16

<i>In trouble</i>. In their trouble.
<span>צקון</span> <i>They poured out</i>. The <span>נ</span> is paragogic, as in <span>ידעון</span> they knew (Deut. 8:3); the word is besides irregular; the regular form is <span>יצקו</span>; the first radical is dropped in <span>צקון</span>; comp. <span>ירד═רד</span> he went down (Judg. 19:11).

Verse 19

<i>Thy dead men shall live</i>. Only Thy dead men shall live; God is addressed. Generally, it is believed, that this phrase contains some reference to the resurrection of the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Comp.

<i>My dead body</i>. The first person refers to the prophet, who is one of the Israelites, that are considered as dead. Let Thy dead men live, and let the dead of my people rise, as if they heard the cry: Awake, etc.

<span>חבי</span> Some explain this word as a regular form of a verb <span>(חבה) ל״ה</span>; the feminine form <span>חבי</span> is used, because <span>עם</span> is sometimes feminine; comp. <span>וחטאת עמך</span> And thy people sinneth (Ex. 5:16).

Verse 1

<span>ביום ההוא</span> In those days.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><span>ביום ההוא</span> Though singular, does not refer to one particular day, but to a whole period.</i> 
<i>The Lord shall visit</i>. As mentioned in the preceding verse.
<i>Leviathan</i>. The Theli <span>; (תלי)</span><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><span>תלי</span> is the imaginary axis or line through the centre of the earth, and the two points in which the ecliptic and the equator, or the ecliptic and the orbit of the moon meet. The latter is probably meant here. The origin of the word has not yet been fully established. It is generally believed to be the same as in Arabic تالي but the two words, being quite different in meaning, <span>תלי)</span> hanging, تالي following,) are probably not connected with each other. Moreover, if <span>תלי</span> were the same as تالي it would have been written <span>תאלי</span>. It seems more probable and natural to derive <span>תלי</span> from <span>תלה</span> to hang, since it denotes the ends from which the earth is, as it were, suspended. (Comp. <span>תלאי</span> Talm. Bab. Shab. 78; and <span>תולה ארץ על כלימה</span> He hangeth the earth upon nothing (Job 26:7). This axis, being a straight line, is called <span>בריח</span> a bar, which passes in a straight line from one end to the other; but at the same time the attribute <span>עקלתון</span> crooked, is given to it, because the intersections of the ecliptic and the orbit of the moon are not constant, and the three points above-mentioned are therefore not exactly in a straight line. It is likewise connected with the name of <span>תנין</span> dragon; the one end of the line being called the head, the other the tail of the dragon. These names owe their origin probably to the serpentine winding of the orbit of the moon round the ecliptic. R. Jehuda Hallevi compares the axis of the ecliptic with a king, who sitteth on his throne and thence governs the whole country (Cusari 4:25). A similar idea presented itself to the mind of the commentator, who explained <span>נחש בריח</span> by <span>תלי</span>, and signified by this figure the king of Assyria or of Egypt.</i> it has the epithet <span>בריח</span> stretching,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Piercing.</i> because it stretches from one end to the other. [I think it is a sea monster].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The words in brackets are added, firstly because from the remark of I. E. on Job 26:13, it appears that he explained <span>נחש בריח</span> to be a sea monster; secondly, because it is evident from his remark on <span>נחש עקלתון</span> that a remark to that effect must have preceded.</i> 
<i>Even Leviathan</i>, <i>that crooked serpent</i>. This is likewise an animal that lives in the sea; it is like a serpent, for there are also serpent-like animals in the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The sea-monsters are usually called <span>תנינים</span>; this remark is therefore added, that they are also called <span>נחשים</span>, some of them being serpent-like.</i> <span>עקלתון</span> <i>Crooked</i>. It is an adjective. 
<i>And the dragon that is in the sea</i>. That is, The great dragon in the sea. (Ez. 29:3). 
Some are of opinion that the Leviathan, the stretching serpent, and the Leviathan, the crooked serpent, are both land animals, and are used figuratively for the kings of the land;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Assyria or Babylon.</i> while the dragon that is in the sea, is used for the king of Egypt (Comp. Ez. 29:3), or as others believe, for the king of Tyre. R. Moses Hakkohen thinks, that this verse refers to the élite of soldiers, princes, and nobles.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the chiefs of the army of Sennacherib before Jerusalem.</i>

Moses Hakkohen explains it thus, I shall guard it day and night, lest the enemy hurt it. I think that this explanation is the right one.

Verse 4

<i>Fury is not in me</i>, etc. Some say that this verse is the continuation of the words of the Lord. <i>Fury is not in me</i>, that is, great fury is not in me. 
<i>Who would set</i>, etc. Anthropomorphism.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In reality God has the power to do whatever He thinks proper to do, and is not in need of the assistance of any being, as the literal meaning of the exclamation, who would set, etc., implies.</i> Supply <span>ב</span> before <span>שמיר</span> brier, comp. <span>בששח═ששח</span> in six, (Ex. 20:11).

Verse 5

<i>Or let him take hold</i>, etc. Or let the Israelites take hold of my strength, then I shall not have war with them—comp. the Lord hath been like an enemy (Lam. 2:5)—
nor with other nations, for the sake of Israel; this double peace is indicated by the repetition of the words he will make peace unto me. 
R. Moses Hakkohen explains these two verses in the following way: <i>Fury is not in me</i>, what I am going to say, I shall not say with fury. <span>מי יתנני וגו׳</span> <i>Who would give me</i>—comp. <span>נתתני</span> thou hast given me (Judges 1:15)—<i>the briers and thorns</i> of the vineyard! <i>I would go through them, etc.</i>; that is, if they do not remove the wicked men of Israel, I will slay them all; or <i>let him take hold of my strength</i>, etc., then <i>Jacob shall take root.</i>—

The horror and disgust felt for this spot was so great that it was considered the greatest curse to be compelled to live in its neighbourhood, and thus it gave its name to the abode of the wicked after death (Gehinnom═hell).

Verse 5

Verse 13

<i>Ye, that are near</i>. The Israelites are addressed, as may be inferred from the next verse, The sinners <i>in Zion</i> etc.

<i>The sinners in Zion are afraid</i>. They will be afraid of the Lord, when they see His power displayed in the destruction of the Assyrian army; then will they say: <i>Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire,</i> with the Lord, who is like the devouring fire, that is, in Zion, where the divine glory manifests itself.

Verse 17

<i>Thine eyes shall see the king,</i> etc. The prophet brings these words back to the memory of Judah;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has the words <span>אלה דברי הנביא כאומר יזכור יהודה</span> lit., These are the words of the prophet, as if he said, that Judah should remember. The remark of I. E. on ver. 15 begins likewise with the phrase <span>אלה דברי הנביא</span> these are the words of the prophet. This introduction is there an essential part of the explanation, since part of the preceding verse was assigned to the people; but this verse does not require an introduction of this kind. A comparison of this remark with <span>ידבר בנפשו</span> (ver. 18) leads to the suggestion, that instead of <span>הנביא</span> another word, signifying the messenger, or the officer, is to be read, as, <i>e.g.,</i> <span>הסופר</span> the secretary, that wrote down how much each had to contribute, and who was to carry the tribute to the king of Assyria; comp. ver. 18 and 22. The words of this verse were, as distinctly stated by I. E., addressed to Judah by the Assyrian officers. when the messengers of the king of Assyria came for the tribute, and Hezekiah, after having delivered up all the treasures of the temple, imposed besides a tax on Judah for that purpose, they said, who of the princes of Hezekiah will come with us, to bring this tribute to the king of Assyria? thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold the land that is far off, the land of Assyria, that is far from Jerusalem.</i>

Verse 18

<span>סופר</span> <i>He that counted.</i> Comp. <span>מספר</span> the number, <i>He that counted the towers.</i> They taxed even the towers.

Verse 19

<span>נועז</span> We cannot say, whether the <span>נ</span> is radical, or the characteristic prefix of the Niphal; the word is hap. leg.; it means a stranger or a strange man; to consider <span>לועז═נועז</span> speaking a foreign language, is incorrect.

Thus this verse contrasts with the words Thine heart meditates terror (ver. 18)

Verse 22

<i>For the Lord is our judge,</i> etc. There will be no judge to say to this person and that pay so and so much for the tribute, nor will any scribe write down, who shall go to the king with the tribute; for the Lord alone will be our judge, our scribe,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A.

<i>I shall not see the Lord</i>, etc. God is not subject to accidents, that a human eye should be able to perceive Him; He is, however, known by His works.

Verse 1

This chapter<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In this remark I. E. seems to consider the whole book of Isaiah as one, and to explain only the connection between the thirty-ninth chapter and the fortieth, without anticipating the question concerning the authorship of the second part, or concerning the period to which c. xl. refers. The prediction of the Babylonian exile (c. xxxix.) is, according to the opinion of I. E. properly followed by prophecies of comfort and happiness, even if those announce the release from some other exile. A similar remark is made by I. E. on the position of the thirteenth chapter.</i> has been placed here for the following reason: in the preceding chapter it is predicted that all the treasures of the King, and even his sons, will be carried away to Babylon; this sad prediction is properly followed by the words of comfort. 
These first comforting promises, with which the second part of the book of Isaiah begins, refer, as R. Moses Hakkohen believes, to the restoration of the temple by Zerubbabel; according to my opinion to the coming redemption from our present exile; prophecies concerning the Babylonian exile are introduced only as an illustration,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word <span>לזכר</span> is here used in the same sense as in the well-known Talmudical phrase <span>אע״פי שאין ראיה לדבר זכר לדבר</span> although there is no convincing proof for the statement, there is still some support for it. I. E. is of opinion that the prophecies concerning the redemption from the Babylonian exile are mentioned in this part of the book, not for their own sake, but only to strengthen the faith of Israel in those prophecies which refer to the Messianic period; that the fulfilment of the former may support the hope for the fulfilment of the latter. This remark of I. E. is based on the assumption that the prophecies contained in the second part of Isaiah were announced either after the redemption from the Babylonian exile, or at least immediately before the fall of Babylon, when the coming events could already be foreseen by every one.</i> showing how Cyrus, who allowed the captive Jews to return to Jerusalem,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text seems to be defective, as may be inferred from the incomplete sentence <span>כי כורש ששלח הנולה</span>.

About the last section of the book there is no doubt, that it refers to a period yet to come, as I shall explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. nowhere fully explains this point; he only hints at it here and there, <i>e.g.,</i> 49:24, 51:1, 52:1, 11.</i>—It must be borne in mind, that the opinion of the orthodox, that the book of Samuel was written by Samuel, is correct as regards the first part, till the words And Samuel died (1 Sam. 25:1); this remark is confirmed by the fact that the book of Chronicles contains the names (of the descendants of David) in genealogical order down to Zerubbabel.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">1 Chr. 3:1—19; ver. 20 is the commencement of a new pedigree, according to I. E. The Chronicles are supposed to have been written in the time of Zerubbabel; and from the fact that the generations after Zerubbabel, are not mentioned, I. E. concludes that the historian, even in books which are believed to be written by the dictation of the holy, prophetical spirit, does not anticipate the history of days to come. The latter part of the first book of Samuel, relating what has happened after the death of Samuel, could not have been written by the prophet Samuel himself. In a similar way, the second part of the book of Isaiah, which contains allusions to events that took place long after the death of Isaiah, as to historical facts, is, according to I. E., not written by the same prophet.</i>—The words Kings shall see<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Supply according to I. E., the prophet as object to the verb will see; usually the fulfilment of the divine promise is understood.</i> and arise, princes and shall worship (49:7) support this view,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. is of opinion that in chapter xlix. the prophet speaks of himself, who, ill treated, despised, and mocked at, when proclaiming the word of the Lord, is assured by the Almighty that he will yet be honoured by kings and princes, who will witness the fulfilment of his prophecies, and testify to their truth. The events referred to in these chapters having taken place during the reign of Cyrus, the prophet consequently lived at that time. But I. E. does not deny the possibility of referring the promised compensation to the honour and acknowledgment given by posterity to the name and memory of the prophet; in that case the verse quoted would contain no proof whatever for the opinion of I. E. Both views being admissible, it is strange that I. E. gives such importance to this proof, as to refer to it repeatedly in his commentary.</i> though they might also be explained as follows: Kings and princes will arise, etc., when they hear the name of the prophet, even after his death. The reader will adopt the opinion which recommends itself most to his judgment.
<i>Comfort</i>, etc. God addresses His prophet or the chiefs of the people. The repetition of the words Comfort ye is to indicate, that the comfort is to be administered immediately or repeatedly.

<span>דברו על לב</span> <i>Speak ye comfortably</i>. The expression <span>דבר על לב</span> speak to the heart means always to speak kindly, so as to remove sorrow and regret for things which have already past; comp. Gen. 50:21.

Comp. Targ. Jon. <span>ארי עתידא דתתטלי מעם גלותהא</span> I. E. decides against this explanation, probably from the parallelism which demands that this phrase should be similar in meaning to <span>נרצה עונה</span> the punishment for her iniquity is accomplished. From the mere grammatical point of view this explanation is more commendable, since the masculine <span>צבאה</span> is more likely to be the object than the subject to <span>טלאה</span>, which is feminine.</i> but the first explanation is the right one.

Verse 12

<i>Who hath measured,</i> etc. There are some that ask, How is it possible that such a thing<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The redemption of the Israelites from their exile.</i> shall happen?

Verse 16

<i>And Lebanon is not sufficient,</i> etc. God does not want burnt offerings; Lebanon would not suffice for fuel, if He wanted offerings. Lebanon is mentioned by the prophet simply as an example which his hearers can understand ; in reality, however, he refers to all the woods of the earth. The same remark applies to the words and the beasts thereof.

Verse 26

<i>Who hath created these,</i> these creatures that are here; and who is it, <i>that bringeth out their host with number</i> every day. This phrase refers to the daily apparent coming and going of the stars.

<i>My way is hid from the Lord,</i> that is, He does not see what I am doing. The same idea is contained in the words which follow: <i>And my judgment passeth away from my God,</i> that is, He will not judge me according to my way.

Most of the commentators explain <span>ברא</span> to mean <span>הוציא יש מאין</span> to produce a thing from nothing. According to I. E.

<i>He fainteth not, neither is He weary, and there is no searching of His understanding;</i> consequently, His might and wisdom will never depart from Him.

Verse 29

<i>He giveth power,</i> etc. How can He be weary, if He gives power to the faint, and strengthens him that is without strength. <span>עָצְמָה</span> <i>Strength.</i> It is a noun similar in form to חָבְמָה wisdom.

Verse 30

<i>Even the youths</i> who have strength, <i>faint,</i> etc.

Verse 31

Verse 16

<i>Thou shalt scatter them,</i> etc. This verse indicates that the greater part of the Babylonians will perish, and also that the Israelites will take their spoil.

Verse 22

<i>Let them bring forth,</i> their idols.

Chapter 42



Verse 1

<i>My servant.</i> Most of the commentators refer this expression to the pious Israelites; the Gaon to Cyrus; I to the prophet, who speaks here of himself, as in 49:6. 
<i>My spirit</i> of prophecy.
<i>He shall bring forth judgment.</i> He shall proclaim all that which shall happen in future to all nations. According to the Gaon the prophet indicates by this phrase that Cyrus will be a righteous king.

Verse 2

<i>He shall not cry,</i> as the judge is used to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Comp.

Verse 3

<i>A bruised reed.</i> This is a prolepsis, like And stripped the naked of their clothing (Job 22:6). He will not break a reed, is figuratively said for he will not act by violence.

Glimmering flax is here a prolepsis. <span>כהה</span> thin; comp. <span>כהה</span> hath become smaller (Lev. 13:6). There is, however, some difference between these two words; that in Leviticus is a verb, the word used here is an adjective. The meaning of the whole verse is: The prophet does no harm to any nation by his prophecies; he is but proclaiming what is to come in future. 
<i>He shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</i> The judgment upon each nation, as it is decreed by the Lord, is meant.

Verse 4

<i>He shall not fail.</i> The prophet shall not fail, with regard to the spirit, which is joined to his body.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The verb <span>כהה</span> lit. to decrease is according to the opinion of I.

<i>Nor will he be broken,</i> with regard to his body. <span>ירוץ</span> is a verb <span>ע״ע</span>;<span><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Root <span>רצץ</span>.

This latter explanation, I think, is the right one. 
<i>Till he have set judgment in the earth</i>, till the truth of his prophecy be proved, and <i>isles shall wait for his law,</i> for the instruction contained in his prophecies; comp. 8:20, and my commentary thereon.

Verse 9

<i>Let all the nations be gathered together,</i> etc. If some should say that the Israelites did not know these future events, for they were blind ; but of other nations and their wise men, some knew them perhaps, the question is put, <i>Who among them can declare this,</i> viz. that which shall happen in days to come, <i>and show us former things,</i> past events, which they had announced before they took place. 
<i>Let them bring forth their witnesses,</i> that they may hear it.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The declaration that some one else, beside the prophet sent from the Lord, had announced events before they took place.</i>

<i>let them hear,</i> that is, let the witnesses hear the same, 
<i>and say, It is truth,</i> it was so.

Verse 10

<i>Ye are my witnesses,</i> etc. Israel is addressed. <i>And my servant.</i> The prophet.
<i>I am he.</i> This is the sublimest expression of the unity of God; for every other being is different from its real form.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Every creature is, according to the theory of I.E., produced after and by its abstract form in the spiritual world above, but being subject to accidents, it deviates from its abstract original, from its true and perfect form, and is, as it were, not truly itself.

<i>Before me, after me.</i> According to some, before me means before the revelation on Sinai, and after me, after the revelation.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This explanation is intended to oppose the inference, which might be made from the words before me, after me, that God is not without beginning and end.</i> But it is not at all necessary to depart from the literal meaning of the words: No God was before me, and none will be after me, because God is the first and last. The expression formed (נוצר) is applied here to the word God, in order to imply that a god besides Him can only be one formed by man. Shortsighted people think, that the expression formed used in reference to the Creator, slipped out of the mouth of the prophet; but this is by no means the case ; such critics do not conceive the true meaning of the verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">15a</sup><i class="footnote">That there is no God besides Him, not even one formed by Him.</i>

Verse 11

<i>I, I.</i> The word is repeated, as if to say, I do not change as the host of heaven does with regard to its centre, nor as earthly things do with regard to substance and form; I can therefore help at every time.

Verse 12

<i>I have declared</i> in Egypt, to save you. 
<i>And I have caused to hear</i>. I have caused you to hear my voice on Sinai.
<i>There was no stranger among you.</i> The Israelites alone were there.
<i>And you are my witnesses.</i> You were informed of it by your fathers.
<i>And I am God</i> continually; comp. I am the Lord, I change not (Mal. 3:6)

Verse 13

<span>מהיות יום:═מיום</span> When day was not yet.
<i>I am he</i>; and since I am God, who can be delivered out of my hand ;

<i>They that make a graven image, are all of them vanity.</i> They themselves as well as their images are vanity.

E. refers <span>חמודיהם</span> to stone images is to be found in his desire to find system and symmetry in the words of the prophet. The images made of metal and wood being mentioned ver. 12 and ver. 13, the general term <span>חמודיהם</span> must be restricted to stone images, in order to have a complete picture of all kinds of idols.</i> 
<i>And they are their</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Their own.</i> <i>witnesses,</i> to testify that the images see not, nor know.

Verse 18

<span>לא ידעו ולא יבינו</span> <i>They have not known nor understood.</i> The seat of knowledge (רעת) is in those cavities of the brain that are nearer to the forehead; the understanding (בינה) is in the middle one, that is also in the middle of the head.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In his remark on Ex. 31:3, I.

The verb <span>הטה</span> is always used in an unfavorable sense: to turn from the right way.

These words are only brought in connection with that rule <span>לזכר</span>, as a mnemonicon.</i>

Verse 21

Verse 22

<i>As a thick cloud,</i> that passeth away; when the sun comes out, it is no more.

Verse 23

<i>Sing, 0 ye heavens,</i> etc. This is a figurative expression ; it means: great rejoicing will be through Israel, for through the redemption of Israel the glory of God will be revealed to the whole world.

Verse 24

<i>That maketh all things,</i> which I desire; you may infer it from the fact, that I, by myself, stretch forth the heaven.
<span>מאתי</span> <i>By myself.</i> Lit., from myself, that is, by my strength; for God is incorporeal.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of the words, That spreadeth abroad the earth from, myself might imply the idea that the earth has its origin materially in God; I.

Verse 28

<i>That saith to Cyrus,</i> etc. This verse proves that Jerusalem was built in the days of Cyrus; the words thy foundation shall be laid contain an allusion to the fact, that Cyrus ordered the temple to be built, but after its foundation had been laid by Zerubbabel, prohibited its further restoration; it is therefore clear, that Daniel made no mistake in his calculations, as I have already explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">All our learned men agree, says I. E. in his commentary on Dan. 9:1, that Daniel made a miscalculation; he thought that the 70 years of exile, foretold by Jeremiah, commenced with the first deportation under king Jehoiakim, and ended with the commencement of the reign of king Cyrus over Babylon, while in truth the exile commenced with the destruction of the temple, and ended during the reign of Darius Hystaspes. I. E. objects to this opinion, and proves, in the form of a dialogue between himself and R. Jehudah Hallevi, that Daniel was right. The exile lasted only till the reign of Cyrus, under whose auspices the foundation of the temple was laid. According to the prophecy of Isaiah not the building, but the founding of the temple (<span>תּׅוׇּםֵר</span>), was to be promoted by Cyrus.</i>

<i>His anointed.</i> According to some, the prophet; others think that Cyrus is meant; either explanation is admissible; comp. The Lord hath anointed me (61:1), and Anoint Hazael to be king (1 K. 19:15).

<i>I have named thee.</i> Comp. I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine (43:1)

Verse 5

<i>I am the Lord,</i> I alone know what will happen in future; as the victory of Cyrus shows. 
<i>I shall gird thee.</i> I shall strengthen thee, although thou hast not worshipped Me.

Verse 6

<i>That they may know,</i> etc. I have besides given thee strength, in order that My name shall be known everywhere, that I am alone the Lord, and that there is none beside Me.

Verse 7

<i>I form the light,</i> etc. Things which are opposite to each other are mentioned in this verse.

But God commands that there shall be darkness, is the same as, God commands the light to withdraw. I. E., however, lays rather too much stress on his exposition of the verb <span>ברא</span>.</i>
The same is to be said<sup class="footnote-marker">6a</sup><i class="footnote">The evil seems sometimes to be something real, to which the verb to create might well be applied, as <i>e.g.</i> war, illness.

<i>I have made the earth,</i> etc. How will you command me concerning my children, when the whole universe belongs to me?

Verse 15

<i>Verily thou art a God,</i> etc. Then they will confess to God and say, It is true that thou art God who hid himself from the people in which He delighted, and now thou art the God of the Israelites, who helps them. Some say that <span>אל נסתר ═ אל מסתתר</span> invisible God, and explain the verse thus: God, though invisible, revealed himself for the sake of Israel. This explanation, however, is not supported by the rules of Hebrew grammar, <span>מסתתר</span> being Hithpael, and signifying who hid himself.

Verse 1

<i>Bel.</i> The idol of the Babylonians; the same is the case with Nebo. The latter is explained by some to signify the sun.
<span>קורס</span> It is connected with <span>קרסים</span> taches (Ex. 26:11); its meaning is well known.
<i>Upon the beasts and upon the cattle,</i> upon which man is carried. This sentence is therefore followed by the words 
<span>נשאתיכם עמוסות משא לעיפה</span> the beasts which carry you<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Your carriages. <span>נשאתיכם</span> is explained by I.

Verse 3

<i>Which are borne by me,</i> etc. The idols of Babylon are carried by their worshippers, but I, the God of Israel, carry the Israelites. 
<i>From the belly,</i> that is, since the day they were born.

Verse 4

<i>And even to old age,</i> etc. This is a figurative expression; it means since the day they had become the people of the Lord for ever. 
<i>I have made</i> the Israelites; I am, therefore, not like the gods of Babylon; the Babylonians make their gods. <i>And I will carry and deliver</i> the Israelites; while the idols cannot deliver the burden.

Verse 5

<i>And make me equal,</i> that we two should be similar.—This verse is addressed to the idolaters.

<i>Declaring the end from the beginning,</i> that is, declaring the event before it happens; for who can annul my decree; my counsel stands for ever, and I will do all my pleasure.

Verse 13

<i>I bring near my righteousness,</i> to show it, and therefore It shall not be, etc.
<span>לא תאחר</span> <i>Shall not tarry.</i> Literally : shall not stay itself with me too long before coming, for <span>תאחר</span> is a transitive verb.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><span>עצמה</span> itself, the objective case being supplied.</i> It is a figurative expression.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The words <span>דרך משל</span> in the Hebrew text are not in their proper place; they should be at the end of the remark, as indicated in the translation.</i> 
<span>ונתתי</span> And I will place is to be repeated before <span>לישראל</span>. The phrase <span>תפארתי לישראל</span> is therefore to be rendered thus : And I will place my glory in Israel. It may also be explained thus : to Israel, who is my glory; comp. in whom I will be glorified (49:3); the latter explanation is the better.

Verse 14

<i>These.</i> The coming events.
<i>Hath loved him,</i> namely Cyrus. 
<i>His pleasure.</i> The pleasure of God. Cyrus will perform the will of God concerning Babylon, and show His arm against the Chaldæans. It is, however, also possible, that the possessive pronoun his (ו) in his pleasure and his arm refers to Cyrus.

Verse 15

<i>I</i>, <i>even I</i>. The word I is repeated to express the idea: I who am always the same. 
<i>I have called him,</i> namely Cyrus.

Verse 16

<i>Come ye near unto me,</i> unto the prophet. 
<i>I have not spoken in secret from the beginning</i> of this plan and this divine decree.
<i>From the time that it was, there was I</i>. The Gaon finds here an indication that the soul exists before the body; but he is wrong, because it is said, They are decreed now, and not from the beginning<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Gaon, the words From the time that it was, refer to a very remote time, indicated in the phrase from the beginning, which precedes, <i>i.e.,</i> a time anterior to the birth of the prophet, and the pronoun I in the phrase, There am I, to the soul of the prophet. If this were the correct explanation, the prophet implied in these words his adherence to the theory of the pre-existence of the soul. But I.

Verse 17

<i>Thy redeemer,</i> etc. The words which follow are to announce the reward of those that listen to the words of the Lord.

Verse 18

<span>לוא</span> <i>Oh that.</i> The א is paragogic; comp. <span>ההלכוא</span> that went (Jos. 10:24).

Verse 20

<i>Hath called me from the birth,</i> I shall explain this in the commentary on Jer. 1:2.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. c. xlviii. Note 10.</i>

Verse 2

<i>And He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword,</i> to speak elegantly; or, as was the case in his prophecies against Babylon, to speak sharply; and the meaning of the whole phrase is accordingly : Although God has made my mouth like a sharp sword against the Babylonians, neither the Babylonians nor the wicked men in Israel, could do any harm to me, 
because God hath hid me in the shadow of His hand, which is to the prophet as the sheath to the sword; comp. in His quiver hath he hid me. 
<span>ברור</span> <i>Polished</i>, when seen.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. adds <span>נראה</span> seen, in order to show more clearly the similarity between the two figures.

Verse 3

<i>And said</i>. And God said. <span>ישראל</span>
<em>Israel</em>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., O Israel.</i> That is, Thou art an Israelite of whom I am proud; or Thou art Israel, thou art estimated in mine eyes like all Israelites together. I prefer this latter explanation.

Verse 4

<em>Then I said</em>. Then I, the prophet, said. 
<em>I said</em> to myself, 
<em>I have laboured in vain</em>. I have troubled myself in vain to rebuke Israel; they do not hearken.

Verse 7

<em>Thus saith the Lord</em>, etc. The prophet continues to speak of himself: Thus says the Lord unto me, who am despised of the wicked men. <span>לבזה</span> <em>To him who is despised</em>. <span>בזה</span> is an adjective. 
<span>מתעב</span> It is either a causative verb, meaning: causing to abhor, that is, saying things, for which the nations abhor him; or a transitive verb: abhorring, that is, abhorring all idolaters. 
<em>To a servant of rulers</em>, that is of the nobles of Israel, as they consider themselves, or of the Babylonians. The latter rendering is preferable. 
<em>Kings shall see and arise</em>. I have already alluded to the inference that may be drawn from those words (40:1). Most of the commentators explain this sentence thus: Kings, like Cyrus, will rise and worship, when they hear the words of the prophet. 
<em>Because of the Lord</em>. For He remains faithful to His word.—
The suffix <span>ך</span> in <span>ויבחרך</span> and He chose thee,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., And he shall choose thee.</i> shows that this explanation is right.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The use of the pronoun of the second person, proves according to I. E. that the prophet himself is addressed, and that he is personally to receive compensation for the contempt and scorn with which the people received his prophecies. See I. E. on 40:1.</i>

Verse 8

<span>בעת רצון עניתיך</span> <em>In an acceptable time I have heard thee</em>. This expression is likewise a proof of the correctness of my opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See preceding note. The meaning of the phrase according to I. E. is: In the time of favour, viz., for the Israelites, when their redemption was prepared, I have also heard thee, the prophet, and decreed to cause thee to be honoured by all.</i> Many, in opposition to the context, refer the pronoun thee to Cyrus. R. Moses thinks that the preposition <span>ב</span> in <span>בעת רצון</span> has the same meaning as in <span>במרחב יה</span> (Ps. 118:5), namely: with. It is not at all unlikely that his opinion is right.

Verse 9

<em>That thou mayest say</em>, etc. This shows that the prophet announced this to the Jews before they returned from the Babylonian exile.
<em>And their pastures in all high places</em>. And they shall find their pastures, etc.

Verse 10

<em>They will not</em>, etc. When they return to Zion. 
<span>שרב</span> <em>Heat</em>. Comp. 35:7. <em>Nor the sun smite them</em>. Comp. The sun shall not smite thee by day (Ps. 121:6)

Verse 11

<em>And I will make all my mountains a way</em>, etc. The mountains will be lowered, and the paths which are low will be exalted. 
As to the use of the masculine plural <span>ירומון</span>, together with the feminine <span>מסלות</span>, comp. <span>תמצאו</span> ye (daughters of Jerusalem) find (Song 5:8). The origin of the seeming irregularity is to be found in the indifference of the Hebrews as to the use of the plural masculine for the feminine, so long as the idea of plurality is clearly expressed.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">According to this remark, the distinction between the masculine and feminine is in the plural often neglected; Comp. the third person plural past, and the second person plural past with a pronominal suffix.</i> Others explain the verse thus: Those that will return, will be so numerous, that they will have to walk high on the mountains.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the roads between the mountains will not be wide enough for all the people that will return; part of the people will therefore be compelled to walk on the mountains on both sides of the road.</i> According to their opinion <span>ירמון</span> means: they—that will return—will be high, as if the prophet said: they will walk high on my paths (<span>ועל מסלתי</span>)

Verse 12

<em>From far</em>, from the east.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase From far, is explained to refer to The east, because north and west are directly mentioned, and Sinim is supposed by I. E. to be in the south. Where three sides are mentioned, it may be expected, that the fourth will likewise be found.</i> 
<em>From the north</em>, from Babylon.<sup class="footnote-marker">14a</sup><i class="footnote">Babylon is here described to be in the north; but in his remark on 43:5, I. E. says, that it is in the east. It was perhaps north-east of Palestine. See c. xliii. Note 2a.</i>

E. would in that case rather have said <span>והוא מגזרת סנה</span> it is derived from <span>סנה</span> ‘bush,’ than <span>הסנה מזאת הגזרה</span>, the word <span>סנה</span> is of the same root.</i>

Verse 13

<em>Sing</em>, etc. This is a figurative expression; or<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">According to the second explanation the expression must also be figurative; the difference between the two explanations is, that according to the former the nouns heaven, earth, mountains, are used here in a figurative sense, signifying all classes of people; according to the latter the verb sing has a figurative meaning.</i> the purity of the air is to be considered as the singing of the heavens, the productiveness of the fields and gardens as the singing of the earth, and the singing of the mountains can be explained in a similar way.

Verse 14

<em>But Zion said</em> before the redemption,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has <span>קודם הגולה</span> but it may be inferred from the context, that I. E. meant here <span>קודם הגאולה</span> before the redemption.</i> that the Lord forgot her. <em>Zion</em>. The congregation of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">18a</sup><i class="footnote">By this remark I. E. probably intends to say that Zion here is not the representative of the kingdom of Judah alone, but of all the tribes of Israel, so that this prediction might as well refer to the redemption from the Babylonian exile as to the period of Messiah. See I. E. on 40:1.</i>

Verse 15

<em>Can a woman</em>, etc. This is mentioned, because God has given to woman a natural disposition to have pity on her children. 
<span>עולל═עול</span> <em>Sucking child</em>. Comp. Jer. 6:11; Is. 65:20.
<em>That she should not have compassion</em>, etc. Repetition of the same idea.

There are cruel women, that forget their children or themselves;<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This is the translation according to the Hebrew text <span>או עצמן</span>; the question, however, is not whether they forget themselves, but whether they forget their children. It is possible that <span>עצמן</span> is a corruption of <span>עולליהן</span> their sucking children.</i> or there are women that forget these,<sup class="footnote-marker">19a</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first explanation the pronoun <span>אלה</span> these is the subject of the sentence, and refers to the women; according to the second to the sucking child and the son of her womb.</i> 
yet will I not forget thee. Her sucking child is mentioned, because the mother has usually more compassion for the little one that has no strength.

Verse 16

<em>I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands</em>. According to the Gaon, the clouds are meant by the palms of my hand;<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Rashi <em>ad locum</em> (second explanation), and I. E. on Job 36:34.</i> but I say it is an anthropomorphism, meaning: I shall see thee continually; the second part of the verse, the parallelism of which divides it into two similar halves, confirms the correctness of this explanation.

Verse 17

Verse 18

<em>All of them</em>. All of thy children.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">According to I. E. the pronoun them (<span>–ׇ ם</span> in <span>כֻּלׇּם</span>) refers to thy children of the preceding verse, though separated from it by the sentence thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.</i> R. Moses Hakkohen explains the expression thus: Thy children as well as thy destroyers, that is, the wicked, gathered themselves, etc. According to this explanation the future <span>יֵצֵאוּ</span> is used instead of the past <span>יׇצׇאוּ</span>.<span><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The sense of ver. 17 and ver. 18 accordingly is: Thy children make haste, even thy destroyers, etc., that had gone away from thee, all of them now come back unto thee, etc.</i></span> But it is not necessary to assume this irregularity here.

The verse can also be explained thus: They were thy waste places before, but now,

<span>נלמודה</span> <em>Desolate</em>. Remaining lonely; comp. <span>גלמוד</span> solitary (Job 3:7). It is an adjective, of a quadriliteral root. 
<span>וסורה</span> <em>And removing to and fro</em>. It is an adjective, and not a participle passive;<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Rashi <em>ad locum</em>.</i> for <span>סור</span> to depart is a neuter verb. 
<span>איפה</span> <em>where</em>. It is a compound of two words <span>אי</span> and <span>פה</span>

Verse 22

<em>Behold, I will lift up My hand</em>, etc. As a man lifts up his hand, that he may be seen. This phrase as well as that which follows: <em>And set up my standard</em>, are the same as I shall make known this my salvation. 
<em>And they shall bring thy sons</em>. By they the Non-Israelites are to be understood.
<span>בחוצן</span> <em>In their lap</em>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., In their arms.</i> Comp. <span>חצני</span> my lap (Neh. 5:13)

Verse 23

<span>אומניך</span> <em>Thy nursing fathers</em>. Comp. <span>ויהי אמן</span> and he brought up (Est. 2:7). It is a figurative expression for the great honour which will be shown to Israel.

Verse 24

<em>Shall the prey</em>, etc. These words are put into the mouth of Israel by the prophet. How is it possible, the people ask, that Israel should be delivered from the power of the heathen nations ? 
<span>המלקח</span> <em>The prey</em>, which he has taken, that is, the captives. 
<span>ואם שבי צדיק ימלט</span> <em>Or shall the righteous</em><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Lawful.</i> <em>captive be delivered</em>, because of his righteousness, after having been taken by the mighty.

Verse 25

<em>The captive of the mighty</em>. The captive which the mighty man has taken, will be taken away from him. 
<span>עריץ</span> <em>The terrible</em>. It is an adjective with transitive meaning: causing terror; comp. <span>אימים</span> (Gen. 14:5).
Moreover, <em>I will contend with him that contendeth with thee</em>. I shall make war against those that attack thee. <span>יריבך</span> <em>that contendeth with thee</em>. Some derive it from <span>ירב</span>; others by metathesis from <span>ריב</span>;<span><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">There is in fact no difference between the two views, whether we assume a new root <span>ירב</span> which has the same meaning as <span>ריב</span>, or say that it is the same root, the <span>י</span> having changed its place; in both cases <span>יריב</span> is a noun, meaning he that contendeth.</i></span> according to the Jerusalemite<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See I.

Verse 26

<span>מוניך</span> <em>That oppress thee</em>. Comp. <span>ולא תגו</span> ye shall not oppress (Lev. 25:17). Others say that it means: thy numberers, comparing it with <span>מונה</span> that telleth (Jer. 33:13), because Israel is compared to a flock of sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">It is true that Israel is often compared by the prophets and poets to a flock of sheep; but in this chapter this is not the case, and the verb <span>מוניך</span>, if taken in this figurative sense, would here be too isolated, and out of place.</i> 
<span>מדמם = דמם</span> <em>With their own blood</em>. An ellipsis is as frequently found in poetry.

Chapter 50



Verse 1

<span>ספר כריתות</span> Bill of divorcement.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has the words <span>גט כריתות אמכם ובין אשתו</span>. There is no doubt that this passage is corrupt; the original words were perhaps: <span>כריתות אמכם ֗ גט בין איש ובין אשתו</span>; or <span>כריתות ֗ גט ׃ אמכם ֗ ובין אישה</span> the latter suggestion has been adopted for the translation.</i> 
<em>Of your mother</em> and her husband.—This verse seems to contradict the prophecy of Jeremiah, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce (3:8); but in fact the latter refers to the kingdom of the ten tribes which will never again be established; comp. She shall no more rise (Am. 5:2); but Isaiah speaks of the kingdom of the house of David, which will be restored by Messiah.

Verse 2

<em>Wherefore when I come</em>, etc. This verse proves that already prophets have tried to make Israel return to the Lord. 
<em>Behold I dry up</em>, etc. This proves that the power of God will not fail in redeeming Israel.

Verse 3

<span>מלבוש קדרׂות ═ קדרות</span> <em>With black cloth</em>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., With blackness. See c. xlix. Note 23.</i> that is, with clouds. Some understand it to refer to an eclipse of the sun, when the sky becomes obscure in the middle of the day, and appears as if covered with sackcloth, which is usually black.

Verse 4

<em>The Lord hath given me</em>, etc. The first person refers to the prophet.

<span>לדעת לעות את יעף דבר</span> <em>That I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary</em>. The infinitive <span>לעות</span> is governed by <span>לדעת</span> to know; it is derived from <span>עת</span> time, or it is hap. leg.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text seems here to be corrupt. The words <span>והנה לעות לשון עת</span> are written twice, and the explanation of the word <span>יעף</span> which should follow that of <span>לעות</span>, is put in the middle. It may therefore be suggested, that the words <span>והנה לעות לשון עת או היא מלה זרה אין רע לה</span> were intended to be substituted for <span>והנה לעות לשון עת</span>, but were by some misunderstanding misplaced, while the original phrase was allowed to occupy its position. The translation has been made according to this supposition.</i> By him that is weary, the pupil is meant, who has a hard lesson to learn,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has <span>דברים קיצים</span>, but <span>יצ</span> seems to be nothing but a mutilated <span>ש</span>; and the original form of the phrase probably was <span>דברים קשים</span> difficult things.</i> of which he soon becomes tired and weary. 
<em>He wakeneth</em>, etc. The Lord stirreth me up every morning; he stirreth up my ear that I may listen as pupils do; for I am a pupil of the Lord.

Verse 5

<em>The Lord God hath opened mine ear</em>, etc. Since the Lord hath opened mine ear, and revealed His plan to me, I have not objected to be His messenger.

Verse 6

<em>I gave my back</em>, etc. I did not care that I had to expose my back to strokes for the sake of His name.

Verse 7

<em>I shall not be ashamed</em>. God will fulfil all the words prophesied by me.

Verse 8

<em>Near is</em>, etc. Near is the time, when I shall appear as justified in my prophecies; then I shall say, Who will, etc.

Verse 9

<em>Behold the Lord</em>, etc. Since God assists me, who will condemn me ? And all those that condemn me by their words, they will wax old as a garment. <span>יבלו</span> <em>They shall wax old</em>. They shall perish.

Verse 10

<em>Who is amongst you</em>, etc. The prophet now addresses those same people, that condemn him. 
<em>That walked in darkness</em>, etc. The relative pronoun refers to <span>ירא יי</span> him that feareth the Lord. The meaning of the sentence is, Who is among you, etc., that does not run after material honours and pleasures; let him trust in the Lord, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to this explanation, vers. 10 qualifies the term <span>כלם</span> all of them of the preceding verse. If there be among them any one that acts according to the words of the Lord taught by the prophet, he may trust in the Lord, that he will be saved, and will not be involved in the threatened punishment.</i> According to others, the words that walketh in darkness, describe His servant, the prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">According to this explanation, this verse contains a rhetorical question, establishing the correctness of the term all of them. There is none among them that acts according to the words of the prophet, who is described here to be walking in darkness, that is, to be exposed to all kinds of trouble and annoyance, but who trusts in the Lord that he will surely be relieved of it.</i> and the meaning of the whole sentence is, Who is among you, etc., that is, there is none among you, that feareth the Lord, because you see the prophet obtaining no honours from the people. This is the right explanation, and it is confirmed by the words which follow.

Verse 11

<span>זיקות</span> <em>Sparks</em>. The meaning of the word must be found from the context.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">First, it corresponds to <span>אש</span> fire in the parallel phrase; secondly, it is connected with the verb <span>בערתם</span> ye have kindled.</i> <span>מאזרי</span> <em>Who compass</em> yourselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The verb <span>אזר</span> to compass about, governs two accusatives, the one, <span>זיקות</span> sparks, is the thing which is put round, the other, <span>נפשבם</span> yourselves, which is understood, is the thing round which it is put By the omission of <span>נפשכם</span> the verb becomes similar to a reflective verb.</i> 
<em>This</em>. This decree.
<span>למעצבה תשכבון</span> <em>Ye shall lie down in sorrow</em>. You shall die in sorrow. Comp. <span>וישכב דוד</span> and David slept, that is, and David died (1 Kings 2:10); there are, besides, a great many instances of the use of the verb <span>שכב</span> in this sense.

Chapter 51



Verse 1

<em>Hearken to me</em>. The prophet speaks now to the good people, who believe in the words of the prophets. 
<em>Look</em>, etc. Be not surprised how Zion can again be filled with her children as before, but look, etc. 
<em>Look unto the rock</em>. Comp. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock (Ex. 18:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">By this quotation I. E. intends to prove the use of phrases like to stand upon the rock, to look unto the rock in a figurative sense. The phrase quoted from Exodus refers to God, and can therefore by no means be taken in its literal meaning.</i>
 <em>Unto the rock</em>. Unto the name of the rock,<sup class="footnote-marker">1a</sup><i class="footnote">This is the literal translation of the Hebrew text; but it is possible that the word <span>שם</span> is a superfluous repetition of the word <span>שׇם</span> in the preceding phrase; if that be the case, the translation must be thus: <span>ממנו צור שחצבתם ═ צור חצבתם</span> the rock of which you are hewn, and that is Abraham.</i> of which you are hewn; that is, unto the name of Abraham. 
<span>מקבת</span> <em>The hole</em>. Comp. <span>ויקב</span> and bored (2 Kings 12:10).
<em>To the hole of the pit</em>, etc. Sarah is meant.

Verse 2

<span>תחוללכם</span> <em>That bare you</em>. According to R. Jonah, it is future, like <span><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This word is not to be found in the Bible; very probably another word was intended by I.

Moses Hakkohen believes it to be an adjective, although there is no other adjective of the same form.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The feminine is here required, and if <span>תחוללבם</span> is not a verb, but a noun, the <span>ת</span> is the prefix indicating the form of the noun, while the feminine termination <span>ה</span> or <span>ת</span> is missing.</i> 
<span>וַאֲבׇרְכֵהוּ</span> <em>And blessed him</em>. The <span>ו</span> has Pathah, because <span>ואברכהו</span> is future: it means, I told him that I should bless him; and so it was. In the same way.

Verse 3

<em>The Lord shall comfort Zion</em>, etc. Thus the connection of this verse with the preceding one is explained. <em>He hath comforted all her waste places</em>, by the multitude of her children, of her inhabitants.

Verse 4

<em>Hearken unto me</em>. The first person in this verse refers to God.
<em>A law</em>. The word of God proclaimed by the prophet.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 8:16 and 20.</i> 
<span>ארגיע</span> <em>I will make to rest</em>. Comp. <span>המרנעה</span> the rest (28:12). One of the commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Grammarian R. Jonah, quoted in Michlal Jophi ad locum.</i> explains it: I will do in a moment, without delay. The first explanation is better.

Verse 5

<em>Is near</em>, to be seen. 
<span>זרועי</span> <em>Mine arms</em>, is the subject. <span>עמים</span> <em>The people</em> is the object. <em>The isles shall wait upon me</em>, etc., at that time.

Verse 6

<em>Lift up your eyes</em>, etc. Philosophers derive from this verse the doctrine of the immortality of the soul of man;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If all die, and the salvation of the Lord still remains, there must be left something, that is to enjoy that salvation; if the bodies die, the souls are supposed to remain alive. According to I. E. this is not the idea expressed by the words of this verse; they contain rather in a hyperbolical manner, the idea that the salvation of the Lord is sure to come, even if the present sad aspect of affairs gives no room for that hope.</i> their doctrine is right; but this verse certainly does not contain it. <span>השמים</span> The sky.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A.

Verse 7

<em>The reproach of men</em>. The reproach of the Babylonians and the heathen peoples that have been brought to Babylon as captives.

Verse 8

Verse 9

<span>עורי</span> <em>Awake</em>. The accent is on the last syllable; there are many instances of this exception.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to the rules of accentuation in Hebrew, the accent should be on the first syllable. See I. E. on 3:26, note 25.</i> 
<em>Put on strength, O arm of the Lord</em>. The strength is, like the garment, an ornament of the arm.

<span>השמה</span> <em>That hath made</em>. It is in form similar to <span>השבה</span> that hath returned (Ruth 2:6). The second part of the verse is a mere repetition of the idea contained in the first.

Verse 11

<em>And the redeemed</em>, etc. The connection between this and the preceding verses is: Awake, O arm, etc., and then, when this is the case, the redeemed of the Lord shall return. I have explained this already (35:10)

Verse 12

<em>I am he that comforteth you</em>. The pronouns I and you, refer to the prophet and the people respectively. 
<em>Thou</em>. It is generally believed that Israel is here addressed; but I think, that the prophet speaks to his own soul, in a prophetical spirit;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the prophet is addressed by God. The quotation which follows proves it, because it cannot be said according to I. E. of the whole nation, And I have put my words in thy mouth.</i> comp.

Verse 13

<em>And forgottest</em>. It is as if thou didst forget. The prophet, in his prophetical spirit, speaks thus to his own heart. <em>The Lord thy Maker</em>, who is omnipotent; for heaven and earth are in His power. 
<em>The oppressor</em>. Comp. I gave my back to the smiters (50:6).
<em>To destroy</em>, that is, to kill men. <em>And where is</em>, etc. Where is now the fury of the oppressor.

The meaning of the verse might also be the following: I am he who stilleth the sea, but I am also he who commandeth that its waves shall roar. Sea and waves are figurative expressions for the oppressors.

Verse 16

<em>I have covered thee</em> to protect thee against him, who was ready to destroy (ver. 13). 
<em>To plant the heavens</em>. A figurative expression for the announcement to be made to the countries that they shall be restored to their former happiness.

Verse 1

All agree that this prophecy has reference to the time yet to come, notwithstanding the passage Depart ye, etc. (ver. 11), which is adduced by R. Moses Hakkohen, though in error, as I shall prove, in answer to this opinion. How could this prophecy be referred to the deliverance and return of the captives in Babylon, when it is said, the uncircumcised and unclean shall no more come unto thee (ver. 1.); for this is as the waters of Noah, etc. (54:1); thus have I sworn (ibid.); such expressions characterise an irrevocable decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since these prophecies are described as irrevocable decrees, but have not been verified at the return of the Israelites from the Babylonian exile, they are still to be fulfilled, and refer therefore to the days of Messiah.</i>

<em>You have been sold</em>, etc. I have sold you to the nations without receiving money for you, and so will I redeem you without giving money for you.

Verse 4

<em>My people went down</em>, etc. Many evils came over my people from the beginning; for when, long ago, they went down to Egypt to sojourn there, they were oppressed. 
<span>באפס</span> <em>Without cause</em>. For nothing. <em>And the Assyrian without cause oppressed them</em>. This refers to the exile of the ten tribes.

Verse 5

<em>How beautiful upon the mountains</em>, etc. After I shall have helped thee, that is, after I have said, Behold, it is I, then how beautiful, etc. <span>נאוו</span> <em>Are beautiful</em>.

Verse 10

<em>Hath made bare His holy arm</em>. He has shown His strength. It is a figure taken from the hero that slays with the strength of his arm.

Verse 11

<em>Depart ye</em> from Babylon, according to R. Moses Hakkohen. I think that these words are addressed to those that are still in exile among the nations.
The repetition of Depart ye is to indicate that it is to be done immediately. Comp. Turn in, my lord, turn in to me (Jud. 4:18). 
<em>From thence</em>. Every one from the place of his exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><span>שׇׁם</span> there seems to point to one certain place, but since no such place is mentioned before, its meaning must be found from the context. R. Moses Hakkohen, who refers this whole section of the book to the Babylonian captivity, understands by there the city or country of Babylon. I. E. who refers this section to the period of Messiah, understands by the word <span>שׇׁם</span> all the countries whither the Jews came during the exile. It is, however, strange that <span>שׇׁם</span> is explained by I. E. to refer to one country only and to require paraphrasing like <span>מִתּׂכׇהּ</span>, since it could easily be connected with <span>כל הגוים</span> all the nations. The parallelism of the verse (<span>שם═מתכה</span>) perhaps gave rise to this explanation.</i>
<em>It is unclean, touch not</em>, that is, keep away from the heathen nations. 
<em>Go ye out of the midst of her</em>. Every one shall go out of the country of his exile. Babylon has not been mentioned in any of these chapters.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">That is from c. l., if we are to consider the north (49:12) and Babylon to be the same (see I.

Verse 13

The passage which follows offers great difficulties. The Christians refer it to Jesus, and explain my servant to indicate the body. This is wrong; the body cannot be wise, even during the life of man. Again, what is the meaning of he shall see his seed (53:10), he shall prolong his days (ib.)? This was not in fact the case. Again, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong (53:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This, if taken literally, was not the case; if in any figurative sense, the whole argument is destroyed which is based on the supposition of a minute coincidence of the facts here predicted with the incidents in the life of Jesus.</i> The best proof,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><span>ראיה גמורה</span> means literally a perfect or complete proof. The first proof was a negative one, but the proof introduced with these words is a positive one that the chapter refers to Israel or to the prophet.</i> however, is the circumstance that this passage is preceded by the Lord will go before you, etc., which undoubtedly refers to the Israelites, and is followed by Sing, O barren, etc., which is likewise addressed to the Israelites. <em>My servant</em>. The Israelites, who are the servants of the Lord, and are now in exile. Many believe that Messiah is meant by this expression, because our ancient teachers said that Messiah was born on the day on which the temple was destroyed, that he was, as it were, bound in chains, etc.;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Midrash Rabba, Echa 1:16. The passage must be taken in a figurative sense, namely, that on the day on which the temple was destroyed, it was already decreed, by the Almighty that it should again be rebuilt, but that the restoration would be dependent on the return of the Israelites to God and to His word.</i> but many verses in this passage cannot be explained on this supposition. Comp. He is despised and rejected of men, he was taken from prison and judgment, and he made his grave with the wicked, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days. The Gaon R. Saadiah refers the whole passage to Jeremiah. His explanation is beautiful; he says: <em>he shall scatter many nations</em> by his words, by his prophecy. Comp. Jer. 1:10. <em>As a tender plant</em>. Jeremiah was young when he began to prophesy (Jer. 1:6). <em>And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of all of us; he took away the sin of many</em>. Comp. Remember that I stood before thee, to speak good for them, and to turn away the wrath from them (ibid. 18:20). <em>He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter</em>. Comp. But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter (ibid. 11:19). <em>And he shall divide the spoil with the strong</em>. Jeremiah received presents and gifts from the Babylonian chief of the guard (ibid. 40:5). But I think that this passage must be connected with the chapters that procede and follow. What reason is there for mentioning Jeremiah here after some of the comforting prophecies, and before others of the same kind ? The singular, my servant, is used because the prophet speaks of every one that is a servant of the Lord and suffers in exile, or because <span>ישראל עבדי ═ )עבדי</span> my servant Israel,) refers to the whole nation; the latter reason is more probable. 
<em>My servant shall be wise</em>, etc. My servant shall see and understand, that he will again be high and exalted. <span>נשא</span> <em>Exalted</em>. It is Niphal.

Verse 14

<span>שממו</span> <em>Were astonished</em>. Comp. <span>ושממו</span> and shall be astonished (Lev. 26:32). Every one will be surprised at the sight of the servant of the Lord.
<em>Many</em>. The heathen nations.

E. read <span>תׇּאֳרוֹ</span>.</i>—It is a well-known fact that many people in the world imagine the Jew a being altogether different from his fellow creatures; they ask, Has the Jew a mouth, an eye, etc.? This is the case among Mahometans as well as among Christians.

Verse 15

<em>So shall he sprinkle many nations</em>, etc. This verse is the explanation of the words he will be high and exalted. As it was true <sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The words of the Hebrew text are <span>כאשר היה כן אמתנו</span>, but if we compare them with the corresponding words in the antithesis, we are inclined to correct them into: <span>כאשר היה זמן</span> as there was a time.</i> that his form was destroyed in the sight of those that saw him, so truly will come the time when their oppressors<sup class="footnote-marker">25a</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has <span>מהם</span> of them and refers to <span>הראים</span> those that saw them mentioned before; but both must be understood to refer to the enemies and oppressors of the Israelites.</i> will be punished.

Chapter 53



Verse 1

<em>Who hath believed</em>, etc. Then the Non-Israelites shall say, Who would have believed, that it would turn out as we have heard. 
<em>And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed</em>, as it has been revealed to Israel.

Verse 2

<em>And he grew up</em>, etc. That Israelite who is the servant of the Lord,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the prophet.</i> or the whole nation of the Israelites, <em>grew up</em><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A.

<em>as a tender plant</em>—comp., his branches shall spread (Hosea 14:7)—
<em>and as a root out of dry land</em>, that neither produces fruit, nor distinguishes itself by its size. 
<em>He hath no form</em>. This expression has the same meaning as the phrase <span>ותארו מבני אדם</span> and his form was marred more than that of the sons of men (52:14).
<span>ולא מראה ולא נחמדהו ═ ולא מראה ונחמדהו</span> there is no beauty, nor do we desire him; the negation <span>לא</span> before <span>מראה</span>, refers also to <span>נחמדהו</span>; comp. Prov. 21:14

<span>איש מכאבות</span> <em>A man of sorrows</em>. The servant of the Lord, or the whole nation of the Israelites; in the latter case <span>איש</span> is to be compared with the same word in the phrase <span>יי איש מלחמה</span> (Exod. 15:3),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 40:26, and Note 59.</i> and to be explained a being; it is in the construct state. <em>Sorrows, grief</em>. The troubles which Israel has to suffer during the exile are meant. 
<em>And we hid, as it were, our faces from him</em>. Even in our days there are people who turn aside at the sight of a Jew, lest they may be obliged to assist him.

Verse 4

<em>Surely he hath borne</em>, etc. The summary of this verse is: We have caused him grief, and he has borne it; he has endured our sorrow, that is, the sorrow which we have inflicted upon him, and we thought that he was stricken, etc. 
<span>נגוע</span> <em>Stricken</em>. Comp. <span>נגע</span> plague (Lev. 13:5).
<span>מֻבֵּה</span> <em>Smitten of</em>. It is in the construct state. <em>Smitten of God and afflicted</em>.
While we deserved to be afflicted with all this grief, because our religion is false, it came instead upon Israel, who follow the true religion. Comp. All we like sheep have gone astray (ver. 6)

Verse 5

<span>מחולל</span> <em>Slain</em>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Wounded.</i> Comp. <span>חלל</span> slain (Deut. 21:1). 
<em>The chastisement of our peace was upon him</em>. The chastisement was inflicted upon him for the purpose of prolonging our peace, as we see; for <em>With his stripes we are healed</em>. 
The meaning of this verse is: God will in future visit those nations that trouble Israel with punishment (comp. Joel 4:21): but at present the chastisement of our peace is upon him; for it is well known that so long as Israel is in exile, the heathen peoples will enjoy happiness; while of the time of our deliverance it is predicted, And there will be a time of trouble (Dan. 12:1); moreover, when the angels said, All the earth is dwelling in peace; one of them asked, How long wilt Thou not pity Jerusalem ? (Zech. 1:11, 12), because he thought that so long as the heathen people have peace, Jerusalem would not find mercy.

Verse 6

<em>All we like sheep</em>, etc. At last they will acknowledge the truth; that it was an error to think him smitten of God (ver. 4), comp. Surely our fathers have inherited lies, etc. (Jer. 16:14). 
<span>הפגיע</span> <em>Hath laid</em>. Lit. Hath caused to meet; comp. <span>ויפגע</span> and he alighted (Gen. 28:11).
<span>עון</span> Lit. iniquity; here it means the punishment for the iniquity. Comp. <span>עון</span> punishment (1 Sam. 28:10; Gen. 15:16;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The passage referred to is <span>כי לא שלם עון האמרי</span> for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full (A.V.). It requires, however, to be proved that <span>עון</span> in this passage means punishment.</i> Lam. 4:6). Some explain <span>הפגיע</span> he caused to pray; <span>עון</span> has, according to their opinion, the usual meaning iniquity; and the sense of the whole phrase is: God will accept the prayer of Israel, that peace shall be on earth. Comp. And seek the peace of the city, etc. (Jer. 29:7). But <span>עון</span> in this sense, joined with <span>הפגיע בו</span>, is rather an unusual construction.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If <span>פגע ב</span> means to pray to, the meaning of the Hiphil <span>הפגיע ב</span> is, to cause to pray to, and also, to accept the prayer, if the noun governed by the preposition <span>ב</span> is the same as the subject to the verb <span>הפגיע</span>; and <span>הפגיע בר</span> is to be translated, He caused to pray to Himself; if, therefore, the phrase <span>הפגיע בו</span> is followed by a noun in the accusative, this must express either the person who is caused to pray, or the object of the prayer. The accusative <span>עון</span> is neither the one nor the other, since in the latter case, not the iniquity but the atonement for the iniquity, not the punishment, but the cancelling of the punishment, (not <span>עון</span> but <span>כפרת עון</span>) is the object of the prayer.</i>

Verse 7

<span>נגש</span> <em>He was oppressed</em>. It is Niphal.
<em>Yet he opened not his mouth</em>. This requires no explanation; for this is the case with every Jew in exile; when he is insulted he dares not reply, especially the pious one who devotes himself only to the service of God, and does not care for worldly prosperity; nor does he know any prince or chief whom to ask for assistance, when oppressed by man. The phrase Yet he does not open his mouth, is repeated to express the continuity of this fact.

Verse 8

<em>He was taken</em>, etc. God redeemed Israel; namely, those of them that were righteous. 
God took them from prison, where they were kept 
by the judgments of vengeance.
<span>ישוחח</span> <em>Shall declare</em>. Comp. <span>שיח</span> speak (Job. 12:8). Who could have told his generation that this could happen, since they were already as cut off out of the land of the living. 
<em>For the transgression of my people was he stricken</em>. Every nation will think: Israel was stricken because of our sins; comp. he was slain for our transgressions (ver. 5). The construction of the sentence is: For the transgression of my people plagues came over them. <span>להם═למו</span> To them, that is, to the Israelites.

Verse 9

Some refer this verse to those Israelites that die in exile; others derive <span>במתיו</span> from <span>במה</span> high place; comp. <span>במתימו</span> their high places (Deut. 33:29), and refer it to the building erected over the grave; so that <span>קברו═במתיו</span> his tomb. 
<span>רשע═עשיר</span> <em>Wicked</em>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A.V., Rich.</i> The heathen nations that are rich in comparison with Israel are meant. I think that this verse describes the trouble of the Israelites in exile, which is so great, that they long to die with the nations; comp. Let me die with the Philistines (Jud. 16:20). As to <span>ויתן</span> he longed to give;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., And be made.

The imperfect used in this sense is called by the grammarians imperfectum conatûs.</i> comp. <span>וילחם</span> and he intended to fight  (Jos. 24:9). That this longing for death is caused by the great pains, may be inferred from the words which follow: because he had done no violence. The heathen nations oppress Israel without cause; he neither deserves such ill-treatment, by any wrong act nor by any ambiguous, deceitful word. If the objection should be made that <span>בׇּמוׂת</span> does not change in the construct state into <span>בְּמוׂת</span>, as is the case in <span>בְּמׂתׇיו</span>, I answer, that this noun has two forms in the plural, like <span>סריס</span> officer: <span>סׇרִיסֵי</span> (Gen. 40:7); and <span>סְרִיסֵי</span> (Est. 6:14)

Verse 10

<span>דַּכְּאוׂ</span> <em>To bruise him</em>. It is in form similar to <span>דַּבְּרוׂ</span>, to speak with him (Gen. 37:4). It is Piel.

He and his children will enjoy the salvation, which the Lord will grant them. This refers to that generation which will return to God, that is, to the law of God, in the days of Messiah. 
<em>And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand</em>. The true religion shall prosper, all nations will accept it.

He shall see the reward of his forbearance, and shall find his desire fulfilled; or he shall enjoy prosperity in such a degree that he will be satisfied, because <span>צדיק עבדי לרבים בדעתו יצדיק</span> <em>By his knowledge he will cause many to be just</em>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A.

<em>And he shall bear their iniquities</em>. Israel will sympathise with the heathen nations in their misfortunes, which have come upon them for their many sins; although they do not sympathise with Israel in his afflictions. The meaning of the phrase might also be this: The Israelites will pray to God for the other nations, and thereby take away their sins; comp. (Zech. 14:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The passage referred to, And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain, there shall be the plague, etc. indicates, according to the opinion of I.

Verse 12

<em>Therefore will I divide him</em>, etc. All commentators agree that in this verse the prophet speaks of those that die for the unity of God, explaining the expression <span>ברבים</span> <em>with the great</em>—comp. <span>רב</span> chief (Est. 1:8)—to signify the prophets, and understand by <span>עצומים</span> <em>the strong</em> the patriarchs. <sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The prophets and patriarchs are the founders of the nation of Israel, therefore the adjectives <span>רבים</span> great, and <span>עצומים</span> mighty are properly applied to them; but there is probably no special reason why the former should refer to the prophets and the latter to the patriarchs, and not the reverse.</i> According to this explanation the meaning of the whole verse is, The merit of those that die for the unity of God, is equal to the merit of the prophets and patriarchs. We know that this is true, but the subject has no connection with the context of this chapter. I explain it as follows: I will certainly give to Israel a portion of the spoil and booty taken from many nations; 
<span>מן עצומים ═ את עצומים</span> of the strong; comp. <span>את העיר</span> from the city (Exod. 9:29).
<span>תחת</span> <em>For</em>. The reward for having poured out, etc. <span>הערה</span> <em>He poured out</em>. Some render it, he has discovered; that is, he has done publicly. I think it is to be compared with <span>ותער</span> and she emptied (Gen. 24:20), though of a different conjugation,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><span>תְּעַר</span> the apocopated form of <span>תְּעׇרֶה</span> is Piel, <span>הֶעֱרָה</span> is Hiphil.</i> and especially with <span>אל תער נפשי</span> do not pour out my soul (Psalm 141:8), and to be rendered he poured out. 
<span>ואת</span> And with.
<span>פשעים</span> <em>Transgressors</em> of the word of God.
<em>And with the transgressors he was numbered</em>, etc. Israel was considered like people that transgress the will of God. 
<em>And he bare the sin of many</em>. In consequence of the troubles of Israel, the other nations had peace; the punishment which the latter deserved was inflicted upon the former. 
<em>And made intercession for the transgressors</em>.
He prayed to God for the transgressors. Comp. Jer. 29:7. By the transgressors, the heathen nations are meant.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">That vexed and illtreated Israel.</i>
I have thus explained the whole passage, on the supposition that it refers to Israel;<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The explanation given in the whole chapter seems to be only a concession made to the general opinion, that these chapters, from xl.—lxvi., have no inner connexion throughout, and that in this portion <span>עבדי</span> my servant refers to Israel. His own opinion is, that the servant of the Lord is the prophet, who was in Babylon in exile with his brethren, illtreated there and insulted not only by the Babylonians, but also by those Israelites, that did not believe in his divine mission, but ultimately, when his words were proved to be true by facts, honoured and respected by all.</i> but my opinion is, that my servant, mentioned here (52:13), is the same as that of 42:1, 49:3, 53:11, the same who says of himself, I gave my back to the smiters, etc. (50:6). In my commentary on chap. xl., I mentioned briefly the leading principle of my opinion, which considers all these chapters (from xl.) as connected with each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 40:1, 49:8, 52:13.</i>

Chapter 54



Verse 1

<em>O barren, thou that didst not bear</em>. The congregation of Israel is called barren and a woman that did not bear—the latter attribute being the explanation of the former—because of its small number. 
<span>צהלי ,פצחי</span>. I have already explained these two words.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 14:7, 52:9, and 10:30.</i> 
<span>לא חלה</span> <em>That didst not travail with child</em>.

The opinion of R. Moses Hakkohen is missing in the printed edition of this Commentary.</i> according to the opinion of R. Moses Hakkohen, but I think, that every nation that has a husband (<span>בעל</span>), that is, every nation that has its own king, is meant here by <span>בעולה</span> the married wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is again an allusion to the difference of opinion between R. Moses Hakkohen and I. E., regarding the subject of these prophecies (xl.—lxvi.). They both agree in the meaning of the figure; but while the one applies it to Babylon, the other applies it to all countries whither Jews have been dispersed through the Roman exile.</i>

Verse 2

<em>Enlarge the place of thy tent</em>, because of the larger number of thy children. 
<span>יטו</span> <em>Let them stretch forth</em>. Let the children of the desolate stretch forth, or let people stretch forth;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 2:4, and Note 5.</i> comp. <span>ויאמר</span> and one said (Gen. 48:1).

<em>Thy cords</em>. The cords of thy tent.—The restoration of the towns and villages is meant by this figure.

Verse 3

<span>תפרוצי</span> <em>Thou Shalt spread</em>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A.

Some connect it with <span>פרץ</span> to break forth<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">That is, to break forth from within the boundaries of the place in order to occupy a larger space.</i> (2 Sam. 6:8). 
<em>And thy seed</em>, etc. This is the explanation of the preceding figure. 
<span>יושיבו</span> <em>They shall make to be inhabited</em>. The third person plural they refers to <span>זרעך</span> thy seed.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. makes this observation, as if to say, that in spite of the change in number (<span>יירש</span> sing., <span>יושיבו</span> pl.) the noun <span>זרעך</span> is the subject to both verbs.</i>

Verse 4

<span>לא תחפירי</span> <em>Thou shalt not be ashamed</em>. Comp. <span>וחפרה</span> and shall be confounded (24:23). <em>Fear not</em>, while being in exile. 
<em>The shame of thy youth</em>. The exile of the youths is to be understood;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is the translation of the words <span>רמז לגלות עלומיך</span>; but <span>עלומיך</span> is rather suspicious; for first, the third person <span>עלומיה</span> is required; secondly, I. E. would not have used the same word in explaining the phrase. From the context we may infer that <span>גלות מצרים</span> the stay of the Israelites in Egypt is meant.</i> or the phrase refers to the period of the first and second temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><span>עלומיך</span>, according to this explanation, is thy vigour or the period of thy vigour—that is, the period of the independence of the Israelites, the opposite of <span>אלמנותיך</span> thy widowhood, the period of weakness and bereavement. According to the former explanation, <span>עלומיך</span> thy youth refers, as suggested in the preceding note, to the time when the Israelites had not yet taken possession of their land; </i>
<span>אלמנותיך</span>, thy widowhood, to a later period, when they had been dispossessed of it. when the Israelites were sometimes visited with great calamities. <em>Thy widowhood</em>. The loss of thy independence.

Verse 5

<span>בּוֹעֲלַיִךְ ,עשַׁׂיִךְ</span> <em>Thine husband, thy Maker</em>. As to the use of the plural,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><span>בּוֹעֲלַיִךְ ,עשַֹׁיִךְ</span> instead of <span>בּוֹעֲלֵךְ ,עוֹשֵֹךְ</span>.</i> comp. <span>בְּעשׇׁיו</span> in Him that made him (Ps. 149:2); <span>אלהים</span> God; <span>אדונים</span> Lord; I have explained this in my commentary on Genesis (1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.

E. says that the king is the husband of the country; we separate therefore <span>ואלהיך</span> from <span>מלכך</span>, and consider it as the explanation of <span>ועשיך</span>, which is to be supplied; the emended text would be <span>ועשיך כמו ואלהיך</span>.</i> 
<em>The God of the whole earth shall He be called</em>. All nations will accept the divine Law. Comp. For then will I turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, etc., (Zeph. 3:9)

Verse 6

<em>As a woman forsaken</em>, etc. The reproach of Israel’s widowhood, the scorn heaped upon the Israelites by other nations, for not having a king of their own, having been mentioned before (ver. 4), the prophet continues in the name of God: Israel has been, it is true, like a woman that is forsaken, and has grieved at the absence of her husband, but her husband is yet alive, etc.; comp. thy Maker is thy husband, etc., (ver. 5)—<span>עצובת</span> grieved is an adjective, not a participle, which it resembles in form—the text continues therefore, the Lord hath called thee.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord hath called thee to come unto Him, as the husband calls his wife, after having left her for a short time.</i> <span>ואשת נעורים כי תמאס</span> <em>And like a wife of youth, when she is refused</em>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A.

Verse 7

<span>ברגע</span> <em>For a moment</em>.

This is not the case with <span>בתחלה</span>, which without the preposition is a noun, the beginning; with the preposition it is an adverb meaning at first.</i> Some say that the meaning of <span>רגע</span> is rebuke; comp. <span>רוגע</span> who rebuketh.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A.

Verse 8

<span>בשצף</span> <em>In a little</em>. It is hap. leg.
With <em>everlasting kindness</em>, etc. This is the opposite of the idea expressed in, I hid my face for a moment. The kingdom of Israel will remain for ever (comp. Dan. 7:27); and the days of the exile, though many, will be like a moment in comparison with the everlasting days of the future happiness.

Verse 9

<em>The waters of Noah</em>. The flood that was in the days of Noah.
<em>This</em>, namely, the punishment, which I decreed, and the comfort which I promised.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment is compared with the flood, the comfort with the promise which was then given by the Lord, that the flood should never be brought again.</i> 
<em>And as I have sworn, that the waters of Noah</em>, that is, a flood like that in the days of Noah, <em>should no more go over the earth</em>. Comp. Neither will I again smite any more every thing living as I have done, (Gen. 8:21). 
<em>That I would not be wroth with thee</em>, etc. This expression is used because Israel has been compared with a forsaken woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. could better refer to the same word <span>קצף</span> wrath, used before (ver. 8).</i>

Verse 10

<em>The mountains shall depart</em>, etc. It is possible that the mountains should depart, but my kindness cannot depart from thee. <em>The covenant of my peace</em>, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I.

<span>סוערה</span> Tempestuous; comp. <span>סוער</span> (Jon. 1:11); or Tossed with tempest.

<span>פוך</span> A precious stone of black colour. Some think that it is the same as <span>נפך</span>, an emerald (Ex. 28:18). 
<em>Thy stones</em>, which will be required for the building.

Verse 12

<span>כדכד</span> <em>Agates</em>. It is hap. leg.; it is the name of a precious stone.

Precious, transparent stones shall be used as windows in all houses, and even over the gates. The Hebrew text has: <span>ישימו זכוכיות והן בחלונות</span>; it is rather difficult to find the meaning of these words; in the inverted order they read very well <span>והן זכוכיות ישימו בחלונות</span> and these are transparent things which are put in the windows.</i> in stately palaces.

The translation is based on this suggestion.</i> 
<span>אקדח</span> <em>Carbuncles</em>. A precious stone. The <span>א</span> is prosthetic; comp. <span>קדחה</span> is kindled (Deut. 32:22).

Chapter 55



Verse 1

<span>הוי</span> <em>Ho !</em> It is the sign of the vocative. <em>Ho, every one that thirsteth</em>, etc. With these words the Lord will address those who will then be desirous to accept the Law.

<em>And your soul shall live</em>. That is, your soul shall live for ever after the death of the body, or you will receive new life through Messiah, when you will return to the Divine Law. 
<em>An everlasting covenant</em>, that will never expire. <em>The sure mercy of David</em>, that is, like the covenant which I made with David and the kindness which I showed to him, promising him my mercy will I keep for him for evermore, etc. (Ps. 89:29).

<em>While He may be found</em> by those that seek Him. God is certainly everywhere at all times; but the meaning of this phrase is, while the decree is not yet resolved upon: in a similar way the phrase, while He is near is to be explained, namely, while He permits His glory to rest upon the temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The words <span>רמז לשכינה שהיא במקדש</span> seem to be a new explanation, which is quite different from the preceding one while the decree is not yet resolved upon.

We conjecture therefore that the word <span>או</span> or before <span>רמז</span> has been dropped; and have restored it in the translation.</i>

Verse 7

My ways are righteous; comp., Are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal ? (Ez. 18:19)

Verse 9

<em>For as the heavens</em>, etc., <em>so are my ways higher</em>, etc. This is a figurative expression.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew text there is no proper distinction between this verse and the succeeding. <span>משל</span> should be separated from the succeeding words by a full stop.

Verse 10

<em>For as the rain cometh down</em>, etc. The rain watereth the earth, in coming down from heaven; for that purpose God sends it down, in order that seed may be given to the sower and bread to the eater.

Verse 11

<em>So shall my word</em>, etc. I shall fulfil all I spake to the prophets.

Verse 12

<em>For you shall go out with joy</em>. You will go out from the exile joyfully.
<em>And be led forth with peace</em> to your land on horses and mules. If this passage be referred to the Babylonian exile, it was indeed literally fulfilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Comp.

Verse 13

<span>הנעצוץ</span> <em>The thorn</em>. Comp. <span>הנעצוצים</span> the thorns (7:19). The fir is undoubtedly better than the thorn.
<span>סרפד</span> <em>The brier</em>. A kind of thorn. <em>And it shall be to the Lord for a name</em>, etc. He will perform wonders, in providing the wilderness with rivers, when Israel will return to Zion, and this will be to the Lord <em>An everlasting sign</em>, a miracle that will remain for ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. means either that the rivers and fountains produced in the wilderness by a miracle will remain for ever, and thus continually testify the glory of God, or that the miracle will be of such an extraordinary character, that it will for ever remain in the memory of mankind.</i>

Chapter 56



Verse 1

<em>Keep ye judgment</em>, etc. You know that God will redeem you, and that He will bless you with all these benefits; keep, therefore, His judgments, for, if you do this, salvation is near to come. We may learn from this verse that the coming of Messiah is delayed because of our sins.

Verse 2

<em>Blessed is the man that does this</em>, that keeps the following precepts, to observe the Sabbath, etc. <span>מחללו</span> <em>From polluting it</em>. It is certain that the <span>ת</span> in <span>שבת</span> indicates the feminine gender;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is generally believed that the <span>ת</span> in <span>שבת</span> is radical and that it is formed from <span>שבת</span>, like <span>גַּנׇּב</span> thief from <span>גׇּנַב</span> to steal. I. E. either derives the word from <span>שוב</span> to return, to rest, or believes that one <span>ת</span> has been dropped.</i> the masculine pronoun <span>וֹ</span> refers to the masculine noun <span>יום</span> day, which may be supplied before <span>שבת</span>, or to the verbal noun <span>שִׁמּוּר</span> implied in the verb <span>שֹׁמֵר</span>; for every verb implies a verbal noun, if that is not directly expressed;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. repeatedly mentions the rule that every form of the verb contains the verbal noun, which may be supplied, whenever required, either in the form of a masculine noun, or of a feminine one, according to circumstances. The suffix singular <span>וֹ</span> in <span>ותצפנו</span> (Jos. 2:4.) does not agree with the plural <span>שני האנשים</span> the two men; it is therefore explained to refer to the noun <span>לקח</span> the taking contained in the verb <span>ותקח</span> and she took, and the sense of the passage is accordingly: She took the two men and hid that fact. The subject to <span>תקום</span> (Prov. 15:22) is <span>עצה</span> counsel, which is contained in the participle <span>יועצים</span> they that give counsel. The masculine suffix <span>וֹ</span> in <span>מחללו</span> is in the same way explained to refer to the masculine noun <span>שמור</span> the keeping, contained in the participle <span>שמר</span> who keepeth.</i> compare the remark of R. Moses Hakkohen on <span>וַתִּצְפְּנוֹ</span> (Jos. 2:7), that the suffix refers to the verbal noun the taking;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A.

V., But in multitude of counsellors they (the purposes <span>מחשבות</span>) are established.</i> (Prov. 15:22), the word <span>עצה</span> being supplied.

Verse 3

<em>The son of the stranger</em>. The true proselytes.
<span>הַנִּלְוׇה</span> <em>That hath joined himself</em>. It is the past tense with a prefixed <span>ה</span>, which is here equivalent to the relative <span>אשר</span> that; comp. <span>ההלכוא</span> who went (Jos. 10:24)<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The past of the Niphal of <span>לוה</span> is <span>נִלְוׇה</span>, the participle <span>נִלְוֶה</span> m., <span>נִלְוׇה</span> f. Because of the preceding <span>בן הנכר</span> the masculine is here required, and <span>נִלְוׇה</span> is consequently the past, third person masculine; the <span>ה</span>, which before nouns and participles has a demonstrative character, has before the past or future of a verb the power of a relative pronoun. This latter case is, however, very rare.</i>.

<em>I am a dry tree</em>, because I cannot have children.

Verse 4

<em>That keep my sabbath</em>, etc. The sabbath is mentioned, because it is a sign of the covenant between Him and those that keep it, on account of God having rested on it;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The words on account of God having rested on that day are part of the condition of the covenant; the Sabbath is to be kept, because God declared it holy when He created the universe in six days and rested on the seventh.</i> he who keeps the Sabbath is, therefore, a worshipper of the Lord.

Verse 5

<span>יד</span> <em>A place</em>. Comp. Deut. 23:13

Verse 6

<em>Also the sons of the stranger</em>, etc. The eunuchs are mentioned before the sons of the strangers, because they are the last named (ver. 3). Comp. And I gave to Isaac, Jacob, and Esau, and I gave to Esau, etc. (Jos. 24:4). 
<em>To serve him</em>. The service of the Lord consists in keeping His commandments.

Verse 7

<em>For mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people</em>. Compare the prayer of King Solomon (1 Kings 8:41)

Verse 8

<em>The outcasts of Israel</em>, that came from Babylon, Elam, and Assyria.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The words of the Hebrew text are: <span>כי אם עלו מבבל ומעילם ומאשור</span>. It is impossible to make sense of these words; <span>אם</span> is probably the cause of the confusion, and if we replace it by <span>הם</span>, they, we get a tolerable sense; this emendation has been adopted for the translation. But the whole remark of I. E. seems to be superfluous, for the meaning of the outcasts of Israel is well known. Another emendation suggests itself to the reader, namely, to alter <span>אם</span> into <span>עמהם</span> with them; and to translate the phrase thus: For people of Babylon, Elam, Assyria went up with them (the Israelites). The remark would in that case not explain the expression outcasts of Israel, but the word <span>לנקבציו</span>; its proper place would then be at the end of the verse.</i> 
<em>Beside those that are gathered unto him</em>, that is, besides the proselytes. The meaning of the whole phrase is, <em>Yet</em> will I gather others to him, besides those that have already joined Israel. The suffix in <span><sup class="footnote-marker">8a</sup><i class="footnote"><span>ולנקבציו</span> of the Hebrew text is probably a corruption of <span>ו״״ו לנקבציו</span>.</i>לנקבציו</span>, that are gathered unto him, refers to Israel.

Verse 9

<em>All ye beasts of the field</em>, etc. The idea connecting the following with the preceding verses is, that the righteous Israelites and the proselytes will return, but those that persevere in the worship of idols will not return. <span>אתיו</span> <em>Come</em>. It is imperative (comp. 21:12) of <span>אתה</span> to come; comp. <span>ואתה</span>, and He came (Deut. 33:2). God summons the idolatrous wicked nations, to come and devour the wicked of Israel, like wild beasts that devour each other.

Verse 10

<em>His watchmen are blind</em>, etc. The false prophets in Israel are meant, who were like blind watchmen during the day, and like dumb dogs during the night, that cannot guard the house and are of no use whatever.
<span>לנבח</span> <em>To bark</em>. The word has in Arabic the same meaning.
<span>הזים</span> <em>Dogs</em>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Sleeping.</i> It is hap. leg.; the <span>ה</span> is radical as in <span>הורו והנו</span> conceiving and uttering (59:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has <span>הורים והוגים</span>; but since those words do not occur in the Bible, the words <span>הרו והגו</span> have been substituted for them. I. E. read perhaps <span>הרים והגים</span> instead of <span>הרו והגו</span>.</i> The participle Hiphil has always <span>מ</span> at the beginning.—R. Jonah says that the Targum renders <span>הזים</span> by <span>ניימין</span> slumbering, because dogs are more addicted to slumber than all other animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Dogs are employed as the guardians of the house, because their sleep is not very deep, but rather like slumbering which is interrupted by the least noise; they are, therefore, according to R. Jonah, called the slumberers.</i> <em>Loving the slumber</em>. Repetition of the same idea.

Verse 11

<span>עזי נפש</span> <em>Greedy</em>. The word <span>נפש</span> is mostly used in Scripture to express the appetitive soul;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 26:9, Note 9, and Eccles. 7:3. Three kinds of <span>נפש</span>, soul, are mentioned there; one of them, which is mostly understood by <span>נפש</span>, is <span>נפש הצומחת</span> or <span>נפש המתאוה</span>, the vegetative or appetitive soul.</i> comp. <span>ונפשו מאכל תאוה</span> and his soul (abhorreth) dainty meat (Job 33:20). All these dogs are useless; they do only harm, because of their strong, insatiable appetite, called <span>עזות נפש</span> greediness;<sup class="footnote-marker">12a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit., Strength of appetite.</i> they can never have enough. The words which follow contain the explanation of the figure used here. 
<em>And they</em>, the dogs mentioned here, <em>Are the shepherds</em> of Israel, that cannot understand. <span>הבין</span> <em>Understand</em>. It is infinitive. 
<span>לבצעו</span> <em>For his gain</em>, for that which brings him profit; comp. <span>מה בצע</span> what profit is there (Ps. 30:10). 
<span>מקצהו</span> <em>From his quarter</em>. Every one from his quarter.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This remark, which is usually made by I. E. to explain the use of the singular instead of the plural, is here superfluous; since the singular <span>איש</span>, and also <span>לבצעו</span> are preceding. The similar phrase, <span>כל העם מקצה</span> (Gen. 19:4) was perhaps intended as an explanation of <span>מקצהו</span>, everyone, from whatever quarter he might come.</i>

Verse 12

<em>Come ye</em>, etc. The money which they acquire unjustly, they spend in feasting, and one shepherd says to his fellow- shepherd, Come, let us buy wine. 
<span>ונסבאה שכר</span> <em>And let us fill ourselves with strong drink</em>. Let us make ourselves drunk.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><span>משכר</span> in the Hebrew text is probably a corruption of <span>נשתכר</span>; and the quotation from the Book of Proverbs is to prove that the verb <span>סבא</span> means to drink too much. Comp. I. E. on Deut. 21:20.—To explain <span>שכר</span> by <span>משכר</span> of strong drink would be wrong, since <span>סבא</span> does not govern the preposition <span>מן</span> of; and would not be supported by the phrase quoted.</i> Comp. <span>סבאי יין</span> wine-bibbers (Prov. 23:20). <em>And to-morrow shall be as this day</em>. They do this not one day alone but day after day. 
<span>יתר</span> <em>More abundant</em>. It is an adjective. The morrow shall excel to-day in pleasure and feasting.

Chapter 57



Verse 1

<em>The righteous perisheth</em>, etc. There is nothing but the deeds of these evil shepherds; the righteous are gone, <em>And no man layeth it to heart</em> to consider, why do the righteous perish, and those wicked people remain alive; but the prophet gives the answer to this question: <em>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come</em>, that he should not see the evil that is coming over Israel and the holy city.

Verse 2

<span>יבא שלום</span> <em>He shall enter into peace</em>, etc. The righteous shall come in peace to his grave; comp. Thou shalt die in peace (Jer. 34:5); And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace (Gen. 15:15).

Verse 4

<em>Against whom do you sport yourselves</em>, to ask what good he has done unto us.

Verse 5

<span>הנחמים באלים</span> The best of the various explanations of this phrase is that it refers to idolatry;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The noun <span>אלים</span> signifies here trees under which idols were worshipped.

This expression is the description of children of transgression (ver. 4); comp., And in sin did my mother conceive me (Ps. 51:7).

<em>I dwell in the high and holy place</em>, with the angels above. <span>ואת דכא ושפל רוח</span> <em>And with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit</em> on earth, I dwell, to revive the spirit, etc.; or, I dwell in the high and holy place above with the angels in order to give life to those humble people on earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">According to the first explanation we have to repeat the verb <span>אשכון</span> after <span>ואת דכא ושפל רוח</span>; according to the second the verb <span>להחיות</span> must be supplied.</i>

Verse 16

<em>I will not contend</em> with Israel.
<em>Neither will I be always wroth;</em> for I have created the spirits, and the spirit that comes from me should be humble.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reason why God will not be always wroth; He expects that the souls, His own work, shall approach Him with humility and prayer, and He will no more be wroth.</i>

Verse 17

<span>ואכהו</span> <em>And smote him</em>, namely, my people (ver. 14), or him that is of a contrite and humble spirit (ver. 15). It is the imperfect, for which the Hebrew language has no special form.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 1:21, and Note 43.</i> 
<em>I hid me</em>. I hid my face when I smote him with my hand. It is a figurative expression for I smote him without pity. <span>הסתר</span> lit., to hide is infinitive.

Verse 18

<em>I have seen his ways</em>, etc. This verse proves that my opinion concerning this book is right.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment of the Israelites, which consisted, according to I. E., in the Babylonian exile and their slow improvement, are described here in the past tense: Was I wroth, he went on frowardly in the way of his heart, I have seen his ways, but the promised deliverance in the future tense: and will heal them, etc.; I. E. infers from this that at the time when the prophet uttered this prophecy, the Babylonian exile was already expiring, and that the prophet consequently did not live in the time of King Hezekiah, but was a contemporary of the Persian King Cyrus, and of Zerubbabel.</i> <em>His ways</em>, that is, his repentance, or his innate evil inclination; comp. for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth (Gen. 8:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">According to both explanations the expression <span>דרכיו</span> his ways is different from the preceding <span>ררך לבו</span> the way of his heart, which refers to his evil doings. By his ways the prophet means, according to I. E., either his proper ways, the ways which he should go, that is, the way of repentance, or his natural character, his natural weakness in resisting temptation.</i> 
<em>And I will heal him</em>, <em>and I will lead him also</em>. He is like an invalid, that has no strength to go by himself. 
<em>And I will restore comforts unto him</em> for the calamity that had befallen him.
<em>And to his mourners</em>, that is, to his friends; people usually begin to mourn when they see their sick friend dying.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">That is, before he is actually dead. Israel was in exile, and was considered by his friends as already entirely lost, without hope of recovery. I.

Verse 19

<span>בורא</span> <em>The Creator</em>. It is generally explained to refer to God, and the verb <span>אמר</span> said is supplied. Were it allowed to depart from the common explanation, I should suggest to take <span>בורא</span> in the sense of decreeing; comp. <span>ובורא חשך</span> (45:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. I. E. on 45:7, 40:28, Note 61, and on Gen. 1:1.</i> 
<span>ניב</span> <em>Fruit</em> Comp. <span>תנובות</span> fruits (Deut. 32:13). By fruit of the lips the speech is meant. The meaning of the whole verse is: Proclaim, Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near; announce, that the Lord has already saved Israel, because <span>ורפאתיו</span> I have indeed healed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><span>ורפאתיו</span> admits of two explanations; it can be past with <span>ו</span> conjunctive, and I have healed him, or past with <span>ו</span> conversive, I will heal him. I. E. seems to be in favour of the first explanation.</i>

Verse 20

<em>But the wicked are</em>, etc. God heals the righteous of Israel, but not the wicked, because the latter are troubled, like the sea that is continually troubled. <span>נגרש</span> <em>Troubled</em>. It has the same meaning as <span>ויגרשו</span> and they moved, and is probably of the same root as <span>גורש</span> driving out (Ex. 34:11); 
it is explained by the words which follow: when it cannot rest. Before <span>נגרש</span> the relative <span>(אשר═) שהוא</span> is to be supplied;<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Or the definite article <span>בַּיָם הַנִּגְרָשׁ</span></i> for <span>נגרש</span> is an adjective.<sup class="footnote-marker">35a</sup><i class="footnote">Comp.

Chapter 58



Verse 1

<em>Cry aloud</em>. The prophet is addressed by God. <span>אל תחשך</span> <em>Spare not</em> the crying; the objective case must be supplied, because <span>חשך</span> is a transitive verb. 
<em>Like a trumpet</em>, etc. That all may hear.

Verse 2

<em>Yet they seek me daily</em> with their words and thoughts.
<em>They wish to know my ways</em>. They express their wish in words, namely, <em>They ask of me</em> for themselves the ordinance of justice, and are desirous to be near me.

Verse 3

<em>Wherefore have we fasted</em>, etc. They fast, and then they say, Wherefore have we fasted. <em>And thou seest not</em>, etc. It is as if thou didst not see, nor take any knowledge of it; for thou dost not help us. The reply to these questions is: <em>Behold in the day of your fast</em>, etc. On the very day of the fast every one that has a dispute with his neighbour proceeds with his lawsuit.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><span>חפץ</span> means desire, the object of the desire, business. <span>מצא חפץ</span> to find the object of his desire, to seek to find the object of his desire, to go after his business. This latter, general meaning of the expression is given also by Rashi and Targum Jonathan; I. E. explains it to seek the object of his desire, viz., of his neighbour, that is to seek to obtain what he demands from his neighbour, to proceed with his quarrel, and considers the beginning of the next verse <span>הן לריב ומצה תצומו</span> behold, ye fast for strife and debate, as the explanation of the words <span>הן ביום צמכם תמצאו תפץ</span>.</i>

Verse 5

<em>A day for a man to afflict his soul</em>. Repetition of the same idea (a fast) in other words.

The slaves that are oppressed; comp. <span>רצוץ</span> oppressed (Hos. 5:11); <span>רצתי</span> have I oppressed (l Sam. 12:3).

Verse 7

<span>פרוס</span> <em>Break</em>. Comp. <span>פרש אין להם</span> no man breaketh it unto them (Lam. 4:4); <span>פריסת</span> is divided (Dan. 5:28). It means here to break a loaf of bread, in order to give a part of it to the poor.
<span>מְרוּדִים</span> <em>That are cast out</em>. The <span>מ</span> is radical, as in <span>מְעוּנִים</span> habitations (1 Chr. 4:41); comp. <span>מרודי</span> my exile<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., My misery.</i> (Lam. 3:19).

Verse 8

<em>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning</em>, gradually increasing. 
<span>וארוכתך</span> <em>And thine health</em>. <span>ארוכה</span> is a noun; comp. Jer. 30:17. Some say that <span>ארוכה</span>, lit. length refers here to the time during which the illness is to last; the word <span>מהרה</span> speedily, which follows, agrees well with this explanation.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of the phrase <span>ארוכתך מהרה תצמח</span> accordingly is: The time of thy suffering will quickly run out.</i> 
<span>יאספך</span> <em>Shall be thy rereward</em>. Comp. <span>מאסף</span> rereward (Num. 10:25). <em>And thy righteousness shall go</em>, etc. Thus, there will be protection from all sides.

Verse 9

<em>From thy midst</em>. From thy heart, or from the midst of Israel. <span>מוטה</span> <em>Yoke</em>. Slavery. 
<span>שׁלַח</span> <em>The putting forth</em>. It is a verbal noun similar in form to the infinitive <span>שְׁכַב</span> to lie (1 Kgs. 1:21). <em>The putting forth of thy finger</em>, that is, the stretching out of the hand to smite the neighbour or to take away his property. <span>ודבר</span> <em>And to speak</em>. <span>דבר</span> is a verbal noun.

Verse 10

<span>ותפק</span> <em>And if thou draw out</em>. Comp. <span>ויפק</span> and obtaineth (Prov. 8:35.) <span>נפשך</span> <em>Thy soul</em>.

But <span>נפשך</span> meaning, according to I. E., thy desire (see 56:11), admits also of the meaning: the object of thy desire, and the whole phrase may be explained thus: And if thou givest the hungry that which thou desirest for thyself; in that case <span>נפשך</span> would be the true object.</i> in the objective case. 
<span>נענה</span> <em>Afflicted</em>. <span>ענה נפש</span> means always to fast, as may in this case be inferred from the expression <span>תשביע</span> thou wilt satisfy, which follows.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><span>שבע</span> full is the opposite of <span>רעב</span> hungry; <span>תשביע</span> thou wilt fill, requires for its object <span>רעב</span> the hungry; <span>נפש נענה</span> signifies, therefore, a person that is hungry, that is fasting, and not in a figurative sense, a person that afflicts his soul, that humbles himself by repentance. This remark of I. E. seems to be directed against those who explain the commandment <span>נפשתיכם תענו את</span> (Lev. 16:29) figuratively. Comp. I. E. on Lev. 16:29.</i> 
<em>Then shall thy light</em>, etc. Thy light shall shine even in darkness; when evil afflicts mankind, thou wilt be delivered.

Verse 11

<em>And the Lord shall guide thee continually</em>. He will be with thee, wherever thou goest.

<span>יחליץ</span> Some declare it to be hap. leg., and explain it he will make fat; others render it he will strengthen, comparing it with <span>חלוצי</span> armed (Num. 31:5); others still think that <span>יַחֲלִיץ</span> and <span>יְחַלֵּץ</span> he delivereth (Job 36:15) are the same in meaning;<sup class="footnote-marker">13a</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has the Kal <span>יחלוץ</span>; but from the other instances quoted, which are Piёl and Hiphil, it may be inferred that the Piёl <span>יְחַלֵּץ</span> was here intended by I.

This latter explanation is right; comp. He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken (Ps. 34:21); 
<span>ועצמתיו יחליץ</span> means, therefore, He delivereth his bones from the danger of being broken. <span>לא יכזבו</span> <em>Fail not</em>, are not cut off; comp. <span>כזב</span> leasing (Ps. 4:3), a thing that cannot last but by chance.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The word <span>מקרה</span> chance can not be taken literally here; this would be against the theory of I.

Verse 12

<span>ובנו ממך</span> <em>And they that</em> shall be of thee shall build.
<em>The foundations of many generations</em>, that is, a building standing on a foundation, which will last for generations.
<span>תקומם</span> <em>Thou shalt raise up</em>.

After people had ceased to tread them, thou wilt restore them, that people will dwell therein.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The roads had been desolate for a long time, they were not in a good condition, nor safe from the usual dangers of a lonely way; but now they will be restored, they will be in a good condition and well protected; they will not only be frequented by travellers, but people will settle along the roads.</i>

Verse 13

<em>If thou turn away</em>, etc. The Lord will lead thee continually (ver. 11), if thou keep back thy foot from the sabbath; or, thou shalt be called the restorer, etc. (ver. 12), if thou turn, etc., both explanations are equally admissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between the two explanations can hardly be seen, for if the sentence, If thou turn away, etc., is the protasis to And the Lord shall guide thee, etc., (ver. 11), the words Thou shalt be called, etc., are part of the apodosis, which includes verses 11 and 12. The following conjecture suggests itself as probable: The words <span>או הוא דבק עם משובב נתיבות</span> are the product of some careless copyist, who omitted the word <span>אז</span> after <span>עם</span>, and erroneously repeated, perhaps, from the preceding line the words <span>נתיבות משובב</span>, which must therefore be struck out. The remark of I. E., thus emended, would tell us that the conditional sentence, If thou turn, etc., may be connected with the preceding verses as well as with the succeeding.</i> <span>משבת</span> From walking on sabbath. 
<em>From doing thy pleasure</em>. Repetition of the same idea.
<em>And thou wilt call the sabbath a delight</em>, that thou wilt do no work on it, and thy soul will rejoice in reading the words of the Law. 
<em>The holy of the Lord</em>. The sabbath. <em>Honourable</em>. The words which follow explain its meaning. <em>And thou shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways</em>, which thou art accustomed to do in week days; the same idea is contained in the words from finding thine own pleasure. <span>ודבר דבר</span> <em>Nor speaking a word</em>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A.

Verse 14

<em>Then shalt thou delight</em>, etc. If thou call the sabbath a delight,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I.

Chapter 59



Verse 1

The prophet continues to reprove those who are in exile, and concludes with the words, As for me, this is my covenant, etc. (ver. 21). Thus all these chapters are well connected together in one whole.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The leading idea in all these chapters from c. xl., according to I. E., is to prove that the Israelites are wrong in disbelieving the prophet, and manifesting want of confidence in the Divine promise of a perfect and lasting salvatior. I. E. points out, therefore, how this chapter begins with, Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, etc., and concludes with the declaration that the truth of the words which God commanded the prophet to proclaim, will be established for ever.</i>
<em>Behold the Lord’s hand</em>, etc. Know that the Lord is not unable to help you.

Verse 2

<span>לבין</span> <em>And</em> (lit., between). It is a compound of <span>ל</span> and <span>בין</span>, each of which alone would suffice. 
<em>Have hid His face</em>. This is a figurative expression, taken from man covering his face and closing his ears when he is unwilling to see or to hear. 

Verse 3

<span>נגאלו</span> <em>Are defiled</em>. The grammatical form of the word is a compound of the Niphal and Pual.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <span>נ</span> of <span>נגאלו</span> is the characteristic of the Niphal; the Holem in the first syllable that of the Pual; the Niphal being <span>נִגְאֲלוּ</span>, the Pual <span>גּאֲׁלוּ</span>.</i>
<em>With blood</em>. With murder.
<em>Your fingers with iniquity</em>, that is, with dishonesty. 
<em>Your lips</em>, etc. Your deeds and words are equally bad.

Verse 5

<em>They hatch</em>, etc. They are compared with the cockatrice’s eggs, when they open themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., They hatch cockatrice’s eggs. I. E. supplies the relative <span>כאשר</span> when. The Hebrew text has the words: <span>המשילם שהם כביצי צפעוני</span>. Lit., he compared them, (saying) that they are like the eggs of the cockatrice. This passage seems to be corrupt, because, in the first place, if I. E. intended only to say that the prophet compared them with the eggs of the cockatrice, he would have said <span>המשילם לביצי צפעוני</span>, or <span>אמר שהם כביצי צפעוני</span>; secondly, the whole remark would, in that case, be superfluous; thirdly, from the preceding remark of I. E., in which thoughts and words are pointed at as meant by the prophet, it may be inferred, that the commentator will show in this remark that the prophet speaks of the deeds of the people. It is, therefore, probable that the words in question are a corruption of the original <span>מעשיהם לביצי צפעוני המשיל</span>, he compares their deeds with the eggs, etc.</i> 
<span>וקורי עכביש</span> The web<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has <span>ידוע</span> well-known; but <span>יריעה</span>, a web, a curtain, is meant. The same expression is used by Kimchi in explaining the word <span>קורי</span>.</i> of the work of a spider. 
<em>Of their eggs</em>. Of the eggs of the cockatrice.
<span>וְהַזּוּרֶה</span> <em>And that which is crushed</em>. It is an irregular form; the Segol under <span>ר</span> is substituted for Kamez, as in <span>ולנה</span> and it shall remain (Zec. 5:4.) <span>זורה</span> is participle passive; comp. <span>מולים</span> circumcised (Jos. 5:5); <span>סוגה</span> set about (Songs 7:2).

If one presses the egg, the cockatrice breaks through and comes out. <span>אפעה</span> <em>Viper</em>. Comp. 30:6

Verse 6

<em>Their webs shall not become garments</em>. Their deeds are compared with the spider’s web, that is to say, they are not durable.

Verse 7

<em>Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, of wasting and destruction in their paths</em>, that is, in the paths which they go. The second half of the verse contains the same idea as the first half.

Verse 8

<em>Their paths</em> that were well known before (as straight), are now crooked. <em>Whosoever goeth therein</em>, that is, he who walks in their ways, and learns from them.

Verse 9

<em>Therefore is judgment far from us</em>, etc. The prophet now represents Israel while in exile, as speaking. 
<em>For brightness</em>, etc. Repetition of the same idea.

Verse 10

Verse 11

<em>We roar</em>, etc. We cry, but nobody comes to our assistance, nobody comes to do us justice.

Verse 12

<em>For our transgressions</em>, etc. The repenting Israelites are now represented by the prophet as speaking. 
<span>ענתה בנו</span> <em>Hath testified against us</em>. Comp. <span>לא תענה ברעך</span>, thou shalt not testify against thy neighbour (Ex. 20:13).

Verse 13

<span>פׇּשֹׁעַ וְכַחֵשׁ</span> <em>In transgressing and lying</em>. These are infinitives; the meaning of <span>פשע</span> is to renounce obedience.

R. Menahem is a famous grammarian of the 11th century.</i>שתום</span> (Num. 24:3); but he is wrong; it is improper to form <span>וישבורר</span> from <span>שבר</span>, with reduplication of the third radical. 
<span>ותשע לו זרעו</span> <em>Therefore His arm helped him</em>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A.

The most striking expression in the anthropomorphism, the verb helped, as correctly pointed out by I. E., is not replaced by another verb. It is, however, possible that the whole phrase <span>גבורתו והטעם, על כבודו להראות</span> is the explanation of the expression <span>זרעו</span> his arm: his glory, in displaying his power, is meant.</i>

Verse 17

<em>And He put on</em>, etc. This is a figure taken from a warrior putting on his armour.

<i>To the islands</i>, etc. By his adversaries and enemies mentioned before, those on the continent are meant; the prophet continues, therefore, to the islands, etc.

Verse 19

<span>ויראו</span> Some explain it, And they will fear; one <span>י</span> being omitted (<span>וייראו═ויראו</span>); others, paying strict regard to its orthography, render it, and they shall see. 
<i>The name of the Lord.</i> His deeds, as proved by the parallelism of the verse; His glory in the second part corresponds to the name of the Lord, in the first part.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">If <span>יראו</span> means they will see, the expression the name of the Lord must refer to the works of the Lord, since the name cannot be seen.

Verse 20

Chapter 60



Verse 1

<span>אורי</span> <i>Shine.</i> It is the imperative; comp. <span>בואי</span> come (2 Sam. 13:11); these two have Holem instead of Shurek on account of the <span>א</span>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The infinitive Kal of the verb <span class="rtl">ע״ו</span> has, according to the rule, the vowel <span>וּ</span>; <i>e.g.</i>, <span>קוּם</span>, to rise.

<span>בא אורך</span> Thy light is come, if taken in a good sense; but I think that it means thy light has set, and it has become dark; that is,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has the word <span>במו</span>, which can be translated as if to say, or that is, but usually it introduces some quotation from the Bible; very probably it was originally followed by the words <span>בי בא השמש</span> because the sun was set (Gen. 28:11).</i> the evening is come, and the light which has shone for thee hitherto, is gone, but in its stead the glory of the Lord will henceforth shine over thee; comp. The sun shall be no more thy light by day, etc. (ver. 19). By the words Shine, etc., the restoration of the kingdom of Israel, or of the prophecy is meant.

Verse 2

<i>For behold, the darkness will cover the earth.</i> Comp. For distress shall come in like a flood (59:19).
<span>וערפל לאמים</span> <i>And gross darkness</i>—supply <span>יכסה</span> shall cover—<i>the people</i>.
<i>But upon thee</i>. Upon thee alone.

Verse 3

<i>And nations shall come to thy light.</i> He who is in darkness usually sees those that are dwelling in light.

Verse 4

<i>All they.</i> All thy sons and daughters, whom the prophet is going to mention; it may also refer to kings (ver. 3).
<span>תאמנה</span> <i>Shall be nursed.</i> Comp. <span>ויהי אמן</span> and he brought up (Est. 2:7)

Verse 5

<i>Then.</i> When kings come unto thee and bring thee thy children. <span>תראי</span> <i>Thou shalt fear,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Thou shalt see. I. E. seems to have read <span>תִּֽרְאִי</span> or <span>תִּרְאִי</span> (root ירא), instead of <span>תִּרְאִי</span>.</i> like a man that trembles when help comes to him suddenly, or anything he did not anticipate; this is usually the case with a person who finds something.

<i>And thine heart shall fear and be enlarged.</i> Anxiety will be mixed with the rejoicing, which is indicated by the words: <i>And thine heart shall be enlarged.</i> This is the opposite of <span>צרה</span> straits, distress. 
The reason of the joy will be <i>Because the abundance of the sea,</i> etc. The verse may also be explained thus: Thou shalt fear because of the great multitude that will flow unto thee.
<span>חיל גוים</span> <i>The forces of the nations.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A.

But, in fact, the repetition of the preposition is not required here at all, since <span>עלה</span> governs also the accusative; comp. Gen. 49:4; Num. 13:17.</i>

Verse 8

<i>Who are these</i>, etc. This question refers to the children (ver. 4). The words Arise, shine, etc. (ver. 1) are addressed by God to Zion.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It seems as if I. E. explained this chapter to be a dialogue between God and Zion. Ver. 1 to ver. 7 is assigned to God; ver. 8 contains a question asked by Zion, the verses which follow contain the answer of God.

<span>ארבתיחם</span> <i>Their windows.</i> The holes, where their nests are.

<span>פארך</span> <i>He hath glorified thee.</i> The Kamez under <span>ר</span> instead of Zeré, is caused by the pause.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The feminine suffix <span>–ֵ</span> is here to be expected, because it refers to Zion, which is, in this whole chapter, addressed as a woman. I. E. attributes the cause of this change to the pause; but it must be considered as very exceptional, since the pause changes the masculine suffix <span>–ְ</span> into <span>–ָ</span>, but not so the feminine suffix <span>–ֵ</span>.</i>

Verse 10

<i>And the sons of strangers shall build</i>, etc. The Israelites will not build the walls of Jerusalem, as they did not build even the temple; other nations will do it.

Verse 11

<span>ופתּחו</span> Some say that <span>וּפִחְּחוּ</span> is the same as <span>וּפֻתְּחוּ</span> and they will be opened. According to others, And they will open, that is, the sons of strangers will open, etc.; this explanation is not improbable.—The sense of the whole verse is: the gates will be opened continually, day and night, by those that will bring in the abundance of nations. 
<i>Their kings</i>, that is, those who had been their kings. <i>And that their kings may be brought.</i> Comp. To bind their kings with chains (Ps. 149:8)

Verse 12

<span>חרב יחרבו</span> <i>They will be slain.</i> This verb is derived from <span>חרב</span> sword; comp. <span>החרב נחרבו</span> they are surely slain. (2 Kgs. 3:23). Some explain it they shall be utterly wasted, and compare it with <span>חרבן</span> destruction. I prefer the first explanation.

Verse 13

<i>The glory of Lebanon.</i> The best trees of Lebanon; the fir tree, etc. 
<i>To beautify the place of my sanctuary.</i> To build the house of the Lord.

Comp. c. iii., Note 5.</i> 
<i>And they shall call thee the city of the Lord.</i> This proves that the exclamation Arise, etc. is addressed to Zion.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Another opinion is mentioned, Midrash Yalkut ad locum: R. Johanan compares these words (<span>קומי אורי</span>) to those uttered by one who is about to travel at night a little before dawn; he gets a candle lit, but the flame is blown out; he gets another candle, but it meets with the same fate; he then resigns himself and says: I shall not trouble myself any longer with those candles, I shall wait for the light of the morning. The same was the case with the Israelites: they said: We have lit the candle in the time of Moses; it has been put out; under king Solomon we lit another candle, this also was extinguished; we must now resign ourselves and wait, till the Lord himself will renew for us the light. Therefore God said: Arise, my light (<span>אורי</span>), etc. I. E. thought, perhaps, of this or similar passages in the Midrash, when he considered it necessary to remind us repeatedly that the words <span>קומי אורי</span> are addressed to Zion.</i> 
<span>עיר קדש ישראל═קדש ישראל</span> The city of the holy One of Israel. Comp. Ps. 6:1.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><span>קדוש ישראל</span> is the genitive; but it cannot be governed by <span>ציון</span>, because the latter is a proper noun, and proper nouns do not govern a genitive; wherever, therefore, this seems to be the case, another noun in apposition to it is supplied, as <i>e. g.</i> here, the word <span>עיר</span> city.</i>

Verse 15

<i>Thou hast been forsaken.</i> When in a state of ruin.

<i>I will make thine officers peace</i>. They will collect the taxes in peace.
<i>And thine exactors righteousness</i>. They will exact the money with righteousness.

Verse 18

<i>Violence shall not,</i> etc. Repetition of the same idea. 
<span>וקראת ישועה חומתיך</span> Some explain it: And salvation will meet thy walls; comp. <span>וֹקראת אתכם הרעה</span> and evil will befall you (Deut. 31:29); others: And salvation shall call unto thy walls; but it is more correct to take <span>וקראת</span> as the second person feminine, and to render it, And thou, Zion, wilt call thy walls salvation. The correctness of this explanation is proved by the words which follow: <span>ושעריך תהלה</span> and thy gates praise. <span>וקראת</span> is to be repeated before <span>ושעריך</span>, according to the rule of ellipsis.

Verse 19

<i>The sun shall be no more,</i> etc. Thou wilt not want the light of the sun, because of the light of God. 
<i>An everlasting light,</i> that shines day and night.

<i>And the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</i> The mourner sits, as it were, in darkness.

Verse 21

Verse 5

<i>And strangers shall stand</i> before you like servants.

Verse 6

<span>כהני</span> <i>The priests</i>. I said already that the meaning of <span>כהן</span> is, one that ministers; it is therefore qualified here by the genitive of our God. The other nations will resemble the Israelites, and the Israelites will be like the Aaronites; the Israelites will therefore receive the abundance of nations as their tithes. 
<span>תתאמרו═תתימרו</span> <i>Shall ye boast yourselves.</i> Comp. <span>האמרת</span> thou hast boasted (Deut. 26:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. connects with the same root the word <span>אמיר</span> (17:6). In his commentary on Deuteronomy he explains likewise the verb <span>האמרת</span> to mean thou hast praised, but at the same time approves of the explanation of R. Jehudah Hallevi, that <span>האמרת</span> means thou hast caused to declare.</i>

Verse 7

<span>משנה</span> <i>Double.</i> The verb you shall inherit is to be supplied.
<span>ותחת כלמה═ובלמה</span> And for confusion.
<i>Therefore in their land</i>, etc. 
This is the explanation of the word double in the first part of the verse.

Verse 8

<i>For I, the Lord, love judgment</i>, etc. I shall give them their reward, for I love righteousness; I hate robbing even in the burnt offering that is brought to me; therefore <span>ונתתי פעלתם וגו׳</span> <i>I will give them their reward</i>, etc. As to <span>פעלתם</span> their reward comp. <span>פעלת</span> the wages (Lev. 19:13). 
By these words the expression I hate robbing is explained; as if God said, I shall not rob them; for if I gave them not their reward, I should rob them of their wages.

Verse 9

<i>And their seed shall be known.</i> This prediction does not imply that Israel will again be scattered among the nations, but that they will be known among the nations, who will come up to the holy land to celebrate the feast of Tabernacles (comp. Zec. 14:16), and among them that will bring the tribute.

Verse 10

<i>I will greatly rejoice.</i> These are the words which Israel will then proclaim.
<span>יעטני</span> <i>He hath covered me</i>. It is past of <span>עוטה ; יעט</span> covering (Ps. 104:2) is of the same root, though of a different form.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has the words <span>מגזרת עוטה והם שני בנינים</span>, of the same root as <span>עוטה</span>, but of a different conjugation. This is not the case; both are of the Kal, but their roots are different; the one is to be derived from <span>עטה</span>, the other from <span>יעט</span>. The reverse would be correct, namely, <span>מבנין עוטה והם ב׳ שרשים פעל עבר</span> it is the past tense of the same conjugation as <span>עוטה</span>, but the two verbs have different roots. This is perhaps the right reading.</i>
<span>יכהן</span> <i>Serveth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A.

<i>And as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels,</i> with the chain round her neck.

Verse 11

<span>כארץ תוציא</span> <i>Like the earth which bringeth forth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., As the earth bringeth forth, etc.<br>13 I.

Righteousness and praise will increase, as though they grew.

Verse 1

<i>For Zion’s sake will I not</i>, etc. Thus Israel will speak, when in exile.

Verse 3

<i>In the hand of the Lord.</i> In some countries people wear crowns on their hands.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is equivalent to saying that the word <span>עטרת</span>, mostly used in the meaning of crown, that is, an ornament of the head, has sometimes the general meaning ornament, referring to ornaments of other parts of the body, as <i>e.g.</i>, here, of the hand. But it is, in fact, not necessary to join <span>ביד</span> with <span>עטרת</span>; we may join it with <span>והיית</span> and explain the phrase thus: Thou shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord—that is, well protected and guarded by the Lord. Comp. Kimchi ad locum.</i>

Verse 4

<i>Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken</i>, etc. This verse shows that the words For Zion’s sake, etc. are spoken by the Lord; the expression I will not rest, etc. must be taken in a figurative sense.
<span>חפצי בה</span> <i>My delight is in it.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., Hephzi-bah.</i> These are two separate words. 
<i>Shalt be married</i>. The next verse explains the meaning thereof.

Verse 5

<i>So shall thy sons marry thee</i>. This is a figurative expression for the kingdom will be restored to thee.

Verse 6

<i>Watchmen.</i> By this name those that mourn for Zion are meant, who do nothing else but cry, who do not sleep during the night, but are like watchmen upon the walls, 
nor do they sleep during the day, while watchmen may at least sleep during the day; comp. They that cause to watch for lying vanities, forsake their idol (Jon. 2:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A. V., They that observe lying vanities.—I. E. proves by this quotation that the expression to watch signifies sometimes to wait for help, to pray; because <span>משמרים</span> means they that cause to pray, and refers to the people in the ship that stirred each other up to prayer; so here also the word <span>שמרים</span> watchmen refers to those that feel themselves continually stirred up to pray to the Almighty for the restoration of Jerusalem and the temple.</i> The prophet himself explains the expression watchmen by the words <span>המזכירים את יי</span> that remind the Lord. <span>מזכירים</span> is a causative verb; lit., that cause the Lord to remember; comp. <span>הזכירני</span> put me in remembrance (43:26)

Verse 7



Verse 8

<i>The Lord hath sworn</i>, etc. This verse also proves<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text has the words <span>גם נשבע גם זה לאות וגו׳</span>. The first <span>גם</span> connects this verse with the preceding verse in this way: Till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. Yea, he has sworn to do it. But it is also possible that it is an erroneous repetition of the second <span>גם</span>.—The Lord here promised to establish Jerusalem in such a way that it should no more be spoiled. This cannot refer to the deliverance from the Babylonian exile, because Jerusalem was repeatedly spoiled after that event; and since the word that cometh out of the mouth of the Lord, does not return void, these predictions are explained to refer to the deliverance yet to come.</i> clearly, that this prophecy refers to the time yet to come; for the Lord hath sworn, that is, has made an unconditional decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The predictions of good or evil events are generally connected with the condition pronounced or understood, if you hearken unto me or if you hearken not unto me. But a prediction introduced by a phrase like He hath sworn will be accomplished unconditionally.</i> <i>By His right hand.</i> By His might, which is everlasting. The right hand is mentioned here to indicate His power of preventing enemies despoiling the Israelites of their corn, etc.

Verse 9

<i>Shall eat it.</i> Shall eat thy corn. <i>And they that have brought it together</i>, that have brought the wine together.

Verse 10

<i>Go through,</i> etc. Having mentioned the prosperity of the land for the sake of the mourners for Zion, who will enjoy it without anxiety, the prophet continues to describe, how the deliverance of Israel from his exile, and his return to his own land will be with honour; the princes of the nations will say Go through, etc. that is, go through the gates to proclaim in every place Prepare the way of the people, clear it of stones, lift up a standard throughout the whole world.

Verse 11

Verse 18

<span>למצער</span> A little while.
<span>למצער ידשו עם קדשך</span> <i>The people of thy holiness have possessed</i> the holy land <i>but for a little while</i>, and now <i>the enemies have trodden down</i>, etc. Some explain the verse thus: The people of Thy holiness has been dispossessed (by the enemy) for a small thing, or for a short time,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><span>מצער</span> means small or little, and admits of the rendering a little while as well as a little thing.</i> and this latter explanation is right.

Verse 19

Verse 1

<i>I was</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A.

<i>I said</i>, ‘ <i>Behold me</i>, <i>behold me</i>,’ repeatedly through the prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I. E. adds through the prophets, because the Lord revealed Himself directly to the whole nation only once, namely, on Mount Sinai.</i> 
<i>That was not called by my name</i> in those days, but by the name of Baal.

Verse 12

<span>ומניתי</span> <i>And I will number</i>. The repetition of the same root is considered as an elegance in Hebrew.

Those that refer the passage to the future life of man, are wrong; for it cannot thus agree with the context of the chapter, since in the future life there is neither eating nor drinking, as our sages have taught us,<sup class="footnote-marker">23a</sup><i class="footnote">Comp.

Verse 20

<i>There shall be no more</i>, etc. This verse shows, that those who will return to Zion will enjoy a long life.

<i>And mine elect shall outlive the work of their hands</i>. Many works of man retain still their new appearance, while man has already become old, as <i>e.g.</i> a building, a book. The pronoun their refers to mine elect, the subject of the sentence.

Verse 25

<i>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together</i>. This is a figurative expression for peace will be established. Many imagine this to be done in such a way, that God will deprive the wolf of its natural voracity, as indicated by the words, And the lion shall eat straw like the bullock. 
<i>And dust shall be the serpent’s meat,</i> as is its nature; and it will eat nothing else. The meaning of this passage is: it will do no harm. 
<i>In all my holy mountain</i>. All these prophecies refer only to Palestine, for it is distinctly said, in all my holy mountain.

Chapter 66



Verse 1

The prophet, in this chapter, again rebukes the wicked people.
<i>The heaven is my throne</i>. We know that the glory of the Lord filleth heaven and earth; but by the words the heaven is my throne the prophet indicates, that the destinies of the whole world come from above, as it were by decrees, which the king, sitting on his throne, sends forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As to the meaning of <span>גזרהִ</span> decree comp.

<i>The earth is my footstool</i>. The earth is in my power, is mine. Since all is mine, <i>Where is a house,</i> etc., 
and <i>where is a place</i>, etc. Repetition of the same idea.

Verse 2

<i>For all</i>, etc. This is a second reason, why all is in the power of God, why all is His; namely, that throne and that footstool are made by me.
<span>ויהיו כל אלה</span> <i>And all those things have been</i>, all those things, which my hand has made. 
<i>But to this man will I look,</i> etc. Although heaven is my throne, yet will I look to the poor and to him that is of a contrite spirit. <i>I will look,</i> I will direct my eye, my attention to him; it is the opposite of I will hide my face from you (1:15)

Verse 3

<i>He that killeth an ox,</i> etc. I look to him that trembleth at my word, not to those that sacrifice burnt offerings, and at the same time act badly; for he that killeth an ox, <span>מכה איש</span> is as guilty as if he slew a man; it is considered as murder on his part, because the offering is not brought properly; or is guilty as if he struck a man, not killing, but hurting and wounding him;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. <span>והכה איש את רעהו וגו׳</span>, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not.

It is difficult to find any reason why this word should be supplied, since <span>המה</span>, they refers to the sinners mentioned before in the same verse. Better and more natural is the explanation of Rashi, to connect this part of the verse with the following: <span>,גם אני וגו׳ ,גם המה וגו׳</span> <i>Yea they have</i> chosen, etc. </i>

<span>יכבד יי</span> R. Moses Hakkohen says, that it means, the Lord is heavy; that is, it is difficult to them to remember Him and to keep His commandments; as a proof of the correctness of this explanation he adds, that only the Niphal of <span>כבד</span> is found in the meaning of to be honoured, as <i>e.g.</i> <span>נכבדת</span> Thou art glorified (26:15); but he did not think of <span>יִבְבְּדוּ</span> they are honoured, which is the opposite of <span>יצערו</span> they are little (Job 14:21). According to this explanation the sense of the verse is clear.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Kimchi ad locum: The wicked say to those that are anxious to fulfil the word of the Lord, ‘Certainly, the Lord is too hard for us with His commandments,’ but, says the prophet to the good, He will appear in the midst of your rejoicings, and they will be ashamed.

Verse 7

Translators Foreword

T<small>OLEDO</small>, once celebrated for the manufacture of swords, which made its name familiar far and wide in every battle-field, was no less famed for the production of quite a different kind of polished and sharp-edged weapons, which it once sent forth from its schools and universities, and which did good service in the arena of science and literature. Toledo, like a great many other cities in Spain which contributed to the progress of science in the Middle Ages, owed the origin and prosperity of its learned institutions chiefly to the Moorish invasion of the Peninsula in 711. The rulers of the half-civilised Arabs, however warlike, were nevertheless not averse from luxury and refinement; under their sway trade and industry prospered, and science and literature awoke to a new life. Spain is said to have possessed in that period not less than seventeen universities and seventy great libraries. Mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, philosophy, and philology, were the subjects most in favour among the Arabs; the Jews, with their inherent cosmopolitan principles and adaptive faculties, embraced these studies with all vigour and zeal, and, as regards Europe, were to some extent the importers and interpreters of Arabian learning. One of them, neither the last nor the least, was Rabbi Abraham, the son of Meir Ibn Ezra,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra is the family name of our author, as he informs us himself in the introductory lines to his Commentary on Ecclesiastes. <span>, בן מאיר נקרא, מכונה בן עזרא</span> “called the son of Meir, surnamed Ibn Ezra.” <span>בנו עזרא בן עזרא</span> (Introd. to Comment. on Job; Comp. <span>בנו בעור</span> Num. xxiv. 3) are the Hebrew forms of the Arabic إِبْن (Ibnu, or Ibn), which is generally retained by Hebrew authors, either written in full, <span>אבן</span>, or abbreviated, <span>ן׳</span>. Some read it with a Hirek under א, and a Dagesh in ב (Iben, or Ibn) ; others, without the Dagesh, and with Segol or Pathah under א (Aben or Eben). See Elias Levita, Tishbi, <i>sub voce</i> <span>אבן</span>, and Geiger, Moses ben Maimon, Note 9. The latter deduces from the following line, <span>לְאַבְרָהָם בְּנוֹ מֵאִיר סְפָרָדִי אבֶן עֶזְרָא</span>, “of Abraham, the son of Meir, of Spain, Ibn Ezra,” (Yesod Mora, Introd.), that our author pronounced his name, Aben Ezra, with Chateph-Pathah (<span>–ֲ</span>) because the metre requires a Sheva under א but the proof is not conclusive; for, in the first place, Chateph-Segol would certainly have had the preference, on account of the succeeding Segol; secondly, the Arabic (<span>אבן</span>), or a new Hebrew form, (<span>אֱבֶן</span> or <span>אֲבֶן</span>), instead of the Biblical <span>בֶּן</span> and <span>בְּנוֹ</span>, in a Hebrew poem, cannot be the original word, coming from the same author who wrote the Introduction to Safa Berurah and the Commentary on Ecclesiastes v. 1. Either the whole poem is spurious, or <span>אבן</span> is a corruption of <span>בּנו</span>. In the latter form, the same line is found in the Introduction to the Comment. on Job.</i> the Wise <span><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><span>החכם</span>, “the Wise,” is the title generally given as a mark of distinction in science, while <span>גאון</span> indicates distinction in Talmudical knowledge.</i>,(החכם)</span> of whom Zunz says, “hewas equally celebrated aspoet, grammarian, commentator, and theologian. He was an excellent mathematician and astronomer; he possessed very little money, but very much wit; he had an innate aversion to all superficiality.” He was born in Toledo about the end of the eleventh century; the date of his birth can only be given approximately (1092 or 1093).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Note 54. According to Graetz (“Geschichte der Juden,” vi. p. 198,) I. E. was born in 1088.</i> Toledo very probably no longer enjoyed its former prosperity. It had been taken from the Moors, who repeatedly made vain efforts to re-conquer it, and it had more than once to suffer the hardships and miseries of a siege. Such a state of affairs naturally brought poverty and ruin on many families, and Ibn Ezra was certainly not the man to make his fortune under such circumstances; but at all events he passed through the school of hardships, and learned “in his youth to bear the yoke” of misfortune and failure, which pressed hard upon him through his whole life. The opportunity, however, which Providence, at the same time, had given him in the schools of Toledo, and the society of its learned men, for the acquisition of knowledge and the cultivation of the intellect, was not neglected by him. He studied, and studied very hard, as we may gather from the vast amount of learning displayed in his writings. He is said to have been “a genius, who possessed all the learning of his time.”
Some have named the astronomer and philosopher “R. Abraham ben Hiya,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The source of this statement is indicated by Steinschneider, in his Essay on Abraham bar Chijja, Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik, xiii. p. 11, note 20.

Yefeth,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bikkure Haïttim, 5587, p. 50; S. Pinsker Lickute Kadmoniyot, pp. 187, seqq.</i> as his teacher in Hebrew grammar and literature. Whether this statement be literally correct or not, he certainly studied their works, and quoted them in his theological writings.
He employed his leisure hours in composing liturgical and secular poems, which seem to have been received very favourably; for he speaks in his advanced age with self-satisfaction and pride of these bygone times, saying :—<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In the satire commencing <span>נדוד הסיר אוני</span> (Kerem Chemed. iv. p. 138).</i>

“In former days, when I was young,
I poured forth my soul in song;
For fain would I, with poesy's jewels,
Adorn my own, my Hebrew nation.” 
Learned men, from far and near, sought his instruction, and were desirous of ascertaining his opinion upon the most varied subjects. Thus R. Joseph, of Narbonne, requested him to explain three problems touching the Jewish calendar; one of the questions was the following: Why is there in the year 1139 an interval of nearly four weeks between the Jewish and the Christian Passover ?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Jewish law, Passover is to be celebrated in the spring (<span>בחדש האביב</span>. Ex. xiii. 4, Deut. xvi. 1), after the full moon (15th of Nisan). The same festival is kept by the Christians on the Sunday after the first full moon in the spring (after the 21st March). The difference between the lunar year of the Hebrew calendar, and the solar year is balanced by seven additional months in nineteen years, at intervals of two or three years; so that the difference, at the utmost, would be about three weeks. If the Christian Easter fell four weeks later than the Jewish Passover, that is, after the full moon of Iyar, then Passover could not be in the spring, as the law requires. In the year named, it happened, however, to be so, and Ibn Ezra was asked for an explanation, which he accordingly gave, namely, that the year of the Christian calendar consisted of 365¼ days, while the Jewish calendar computed it more accurately 365 days, In the year 1138, the difference between the 21st of March and the beginning of the spring (<span>תקופת ניסן</span>), according to the Jewish calendar amounted to about seven days ; according to the Jewish computation, the full moon of Nisan was in the spring, while the Christians had to wait for the full moon of Iyar.</i> We hear of his friendly intercourse with the poet R. Moses ben Ezra, (whom some authorities<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Gavison, in Omer Hashikcha. See Dukes, Moses Ben Ezra, p. 6, note.</i> describe as a relative of our Ibn Ezra,) from a poetical enigma, in which he described a dinner, with its varied pleasures, which they once had enjoyed together.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ginse Oxford, xiv. note 1.</i> To R. Jehudah Hallevi he was no stranger.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to Jochasin, I. E. was the cousin of R. Jehudah Hallevi, their mothers being sisters.</i> In the commentaries of Ibn Ezra many traces of the literary conversations of these two friends are met with; he always evinces some pleasure in reproducing the opinions and words of R. Jehudah Hallevi,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Ex. xx. 1; Dan. ix. 1.</i> but does not tell us whether this feeling is owing to their affinity of mind or kinship. When authentic reports are missing, tradition and imagination step in, and supply the means to fill the gap. Thus we are informed of the fact, that Ibn Ezra was the son-in-law of R. Jehudah Hallevi, and in what manner Providence brought about that happy alliance. The story runs thus : Ibn Ezra, anxious to increase his knowledge by travelling, happened to come to the place in which R. Jehudah Hallevi lived, at a time when the latter had bound himself by a curious vow with regard to the future happiness of his only daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jehudah mentions his only daughter in a poem which he composed on his journey to Jerusalem. (Ginse Oxford, p. 45, and Divan of R. Jehudah Hallevi, ed. S. D. Luzzato, Lyck, 1864, No. 9.)<br>For the love of God would I forsake even her that sprang from my loins,<br>The beloved of my soul, though I have none but her<br>And I could forget even her son, whom I love like myself,<br>Though nought I have on earth except his memory dear.<br>Oh my child my delight! How could Judah forget<br>Or from remembrance banish his Judah?</i> When the wife of R. Jehudah, in her anxiety to see her daughter married, had for weeks urged this subject upon her husband day by day; he, driven beyond the bounds of patience, angrily made a vow to marry his daughter to the first young man he met that day in the street. It was on the same day that he met Ibn Ezra. Faithful to his vow, R. Jehudah invited the stranger, whom he did not know, to his house, with the intention of making him his son-in-law. His wife, rather disappointed at seeing the tattered garments of the seemingly low-born and ignorant stranger, opposed the marriage. But R. Jehudah insisted upon the fulfilment of his vow, and began to instruct the stranger, who pretended to be quite ignorant. The pupil made wonderful progress, and the satisfaction of the master gradually reconciled the wife to his hopes and plans. Ibn Ezra was no longer looked upon in the light of a stranger, but as one of the family. One day R. Jehudah tarrying too long in his study, delayed the mid-day meal; his wife, anxious to know the reason of the delay, searched his study, and found a poem, which was nearly finished. It was the hymn for the Sabbath before Purim, beginning with the words, <span>אדון חסדך בל יחדל</span> (“O Lord, let Thy kindness not cease”), each verse commencing with the successive letter of the alphabet; the one, however, beginning with ד was not yet written, and this verse, as the author confessed, had caused the delay. Ibn Ezra looked at the manuscript, made a few suggestions here and there, and without much hesitation wrote down the verse that was wanted.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><span>רצה האחד לשמור כפלים · משמרתו ומשמרת חברו שתי ידים · והשני סם בספל המים · שם שם לו: </span>The prayer-book of the Karaites has the following line :—<span>ויי הקדים רפואה טרם יבוא מכה · ותחשב לו ׃ רץ מרדכי לדבר לאסתר המלכה · לאמר למלך הנה עבדי׳ מכינים לו חכה ·</span> : (Landshuth, Amude Haabodah, I., p. 76.)</i> The writer was at once recognised by his style, and R. Jehudah exclaimed: “Ibn Ezra, thou art truly a son of help” <span><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is a pun on the name of Ibn Ezra, the meaning of which is, “son of help,” or “helper.”</i>.(בן עזר)</span> The disguise was broken off, and the marriage took place. R. Jehudah is said to have then described this happy event in the words of Scripture, “I made Abraham rich” <span>אני העשרתי את אברם</span> (Gen. xiv. 23). If, besides the wife he gave him, other treasures are here alluded to, they could not have been in his possession for a long time, as he was in needy circumstances throughout his life.
In spite of his profound acquirements and widely spread fame, he could not succeed in obtaining an office to secure a comfortable home for himself and his family. In consequence of his uninterrupted studies, he lived so entirely in an ideal world, that he perhaps lost sight of the claims of practical life. Whatever he undertook proved a failure, so that he at last exclaimed:—
<span>אגיע להצליח ולא אוכל כי עותוני כוכבי שמי</span>
<span>לו אהיה סוחר בתכריכין לא יגועון אישים בכל ימי</span>
<span>גלגל ומזלות במעמדם עוו במהלכם למולדתי</span>
<span>לו יהיו נרות סחורתי לא יאסף שמש עדי מותי</span>
“I cannot become rich, the fates are against me;
Were I a dealer in shrouds, no man would ever die.
Ill-starred was my birth, unpropitious the planets;
Were I a seller of candles, the sun would never set.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Orient. 1843, Literaturbl. Note 1. Another form of it, in Geiger’s Jüdische Dichtungen, Leipzig, 1856, p. 21.</i>
He repeatedly refers, in various epigrams, to his want of luck; yet he never allowed himself to be entirely overcome by the grievous pressure of poverty. He knew full well that the treasures which he had received from his parents, and which he was so successfully increasing were of sufficient value to compensate for the want of material wealth. He declares several times in his writings, that the true happiness of the pious is not increased by useless and unstable possessions. “Blind-hearted men,” he says in his Commentary on Genesis (xxv. 34), “think that the possession of riches is a sign of excellency for the righteous, but the example of Elijah proves the contrary.” Hence we do not discover in his works any signs of a downcast spirit, or of weariness of life; but we find him on the contrary always vigorous, lively, full of wit and humour, full of love for his people and for his national literature, full of trust and confidence in the Almighty, fired by an ardent desire continually to improve himself and others. How little desirous he was to meet his end, he showed in the following epigram, refusing the invitation which by a poetical conceit he imagines that his departed friend, R. Jehudah Hallevi, had given him to join him in his heavenly abode :—
R. Jehudah:—
<span>ערבה שנתי ואהבתך דודי העירתני ראות צלמך</span>
<span>כתות זבול בחרו בשירך הן הם שלחוני קרוא בשמך</span>
<span>בא נא ונשירה ועל עפר נשכב ומה לך לחיות גלמך</span>
“Though sweet my slumber, my strong love for thee
Bids me arise and seek thy presence, friend!
The heavenly angels yearn to hear thy song,
And ask thee now to join their holy ranks.
Come, let our spirits chant in unison,
While in the dust our wearied bodies rest.”
Ibn Ezra replies :—
<span>אחי יהודה שוב שכב כי אל מאן לתתי להלוך עמך</span>
<span>עד אעשה בנים ומטעמים אוכל ולא אטעם במן טעמך</span>
<span>נעצב אני עלי מותך אך זאת עצב אשר לא אקחה ממך</span>
“Return, my brother Judah, to thy rest,
For God permits me not to follow thee.
A happy lot may still be mine on earth;
For Heaven’s manna I’m not yet prepared,
And though my grief be bitter for thy death,
I cannot go where thou would’st beckon me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ginse Oxford, pp. 20, 21.</i>
After many disappointments and many failures, he at last resolved to leave his birthplace and his native country, in order to see whether a brighter and more genial sun would shine on him in a foreign land.
He was accompanied on his travels by his son Isaac, of whom Harizi in his Tahkemoni says :—
<span>ויצחק בנו גם הוא ממקור השיר שאב ועל שירי הבן מזיו האב</span>
“And also Isaac his son drew from the well-spring of poesy, And in his songs, shine reflected the genius of his father.”<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">a Tahkemoni, III., p. 70, ed. Stern, Wien, 1854.</i>
In Damascus they seem to have parted; the son settled there, while the father continued his travels. Of his wife we hear nothing; she had probably died before he left his home, and to this bereavement he perhaps alludes in the introductory lines to the eighteenth chapter of Exodus, when he says :—
<span>נאום אברהם אסיר תקוה אשר פתח עיני יתרו</span>
<span>עדי הלך חצי לבו וענה הנדוד יתרו</span>
“Thus says Abraham, trusting in Him
Who opened the eyes of his mind,
When his heart’s blood half had been taken away,
And his spirit by wand’ring was bent.”
Of his great works none had yet appeared. While we highly admire the industry and perseverance, the productiveness and versatility he exhibited in later years, we cannot forbear from commending the great scholar for that combined modesty and wisdom which induced him to spend the first half of his life in preparing himself for his future career, by collecting and storing up materials, in cultivating carefully the garden of his mind, so that it might at a later period produce the choicest and most precious fruits.
When he left his country, his steps were probably directed towards that small piece of land which especially at that time—the period of the Crusades—attracted the eyes and the attention of the whole world; to the Holy Land, to that country, which had drawn thither the great poet R. Jehudah Hallevi, the author of the celebrated elegy <span>ציון הלא תשאלי וגו׳</span> “Zion, wilt thou not ask, etc.” But Ibn Ezra by no means restricted his travels to Palestine. Dr. Zunz, in his Essay on the Geographical Literature of the Jews<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Translated from the German into English in the Travels of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, ed. A. Asher, vol. ii. p. 250.</i> says concerning his travels: “He visited Rome as early as 1140, and died in that city in 1168. In the intervening time he had been in several other Italian towns, and also in Provence, France, England, Africa, Rhodes, perhaps in Palestine, and according to some authors even in India. This great traveller, who was well versed in literature, an excellent observer of what passed under his eyes and a profound astronomer, has left us in his theological works, and very probably also in the astronomical Reshith Chohkma, important remarks on Egypt, Gadames, Arabia, Palestine, Persia and India; the tables which he computed in Narbonne and in Lucca, also contain statements of the situation of cities, etc. The commentary on Daniel is particularly rich in geographical information.”
The places which Ibn Ezra visited in his travels, are occasionally mentioned by him in his works; but the information given in those remarks, however copious and interesting, is of too fragmentary a character to enable us to form a correct idea of his travels, and of the impressions he took with him from each country. We are left in darkness even concerning his route ; we do not know whether it was similar to that chosen about twenty years after by Benjamin of Tudela, namely from Saragossa by way of Catalonia, the South of France, Italy, Greece, the Archipelago, Rhodes, Cyprus and Cilicia to Syria, Palestine, the countries of the Khalif and Persia, and thence by the Indo-Arabian Ocean, the towns of the coast of Yemen, Egypt and Sicily, to Castile,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. p. 251.</i> or in the opposite direction, from Spain by way of Egypt and Arabia to India and Persia, thence through Syria, Palestine, Rhodes, Greece, Italy, France to England, and then again by way of France either to Spain or Italy.
From a remark of his pupil, R. Solomo Parchon,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><span>,וכשבאו ר׳ יהודה הלוי ור׳ אברהם בן עזרא ש״ץ לאפריקין</span> “And when R. Jehudah Hallevi and R. Abraham Ibn Ezra (may his Rock protect him) came to Africa.” Parchon, Aruch. ed., Introduction, p. 4.</i> it would seem that he came to Africa together with R. Jehudah Hallevi, when the latter was on his way to the Holy Land. An anecdote represents him as visiting Egypt at the time when the great philosopher Maimonides was living there. Ibn Ezra desirous of making the acquaintance of Moses ben Maimon, made several attempts to see him, but in vain; his disappointment found vent in an epigram which has probably suggested the story :—
<span>אשכים לבית השר אומרים כבר רכב</span>
<span>אבוא לעת ערב אומרים כבר שכב</span>
<span>או יעלה מרכב או יעלה משכב</span>
<span>אויה לאיש עני נולד בלי כוכב ׃</span>
“I call on the prince in the morning, I am told he has ridden away;
I call again in the evening, I hear he has retired to rest.
Whether he be out on horseback or rest on his couch,
Disappointment is my lot, ill-starred that I am.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Orient. 1843, Literaturbl. p. 658.</i>
In Africa he seems to have copied the critical remarks of R. Adonim against Saadiah; he afterwards composed in Lucca a reply in defence of the Gaon, and called it Sefath Yether.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">These words denote “haughty language,” or “language of distinction.” If taken in the former sense, Ibn Ezra alluded to the language which R. Adonim used in his attacks on R. Saadiah ; if in the latter sense, he referred to the holy language, implying that the book contains remarks on the Hebrew language. Comp. Sephath Yether, etc., ed. by Dr. G. H. Lippman, Frankfort a. M., 1843, Introd. p. 20.</i> The literati in Africa are blamed by Ibn Ezra for their carelessness concerning the revision of the copies made from their works, because the mistakes made by the first transcriber usually become the seed of errors and corruptions which multiply with every fresh copy. But all the carefulness and conscientiousness of Ibn Ezra did not save his works from that fate; their text is exceedingly mutilated and corrupt. But little is said in his commentaries on the Bible of his observations and investigations in Africa. He gives some interesting information about the Nile,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Commentary on Gen. ii. 11 ; Ex. vii. 15.</i> the position of Raamses,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Ex. xii. 31.</i> the Red Sea, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Ex. xiii. 18 ; xiv. 27, 29.</i> In Arabia he tasted the so-called manna, and convinced himself by experiments that it was quite different from that heavenly manna which God gave the Israelites during their wanderings through the Arabian desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Ex. xvi. 13.</i> While staying in Tiberias in Palestine, he devoted himself to the study of old manuscripts of the Bible, and had conferences with the elders of the congregation on that subject.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Ex. xxv. 32.</i> Tiberias was certainly not the only town in Palestine which he visited, but it is doubtful whether he ventured upon entering the Holy City, which at the time when a Christian sovereign ruled in it, would not offer to the Jewish pilgrim any protection or safety. There are some critics, both of the old and modern school, who are of opinion that Ibn Ezra never was in Jerusalem, because his remarks touching its topography are based on imagination rather than on personal investigation, and appear to be in direct opposition to the results of modern scientific researches. He declares<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Ps. xlviii. 3 ; Is. xiv. 13.</i> that Zion is in the north of Jerusalem, while it is generally supposed that it occupies the south of the city. It is true that Zion, the mount which David took and chose for his residence, is in the south; but that Mount soon became the principal and most important part of the city, while its name was transferred to the Temple-mount, to the north (or the north-east) of the former place and therefore in the north of Jerusalem. A visit paid to that place would hardly have altered the opinion of Ibn Ezra.
It seems that he extended his travels to Persia and India. Abudirham, in his commentary on the Haggadah, tells us that Ibn Ezra came to India as a captive, and that the fare which he and his fellow sufferers received while in prison, consisted chiefly of unleavened bread; and he concludes from this fact, that this kind of food being considered more economical, was for that reason given to the Israelites by Pharaoh, and that this is meant by the words of the Haggadah: “Such is the bread of affliction, which our forefathers ate in Egypt.” Ibn Ezra seems, however, to have liked the frugal Indian meals, at which no meat was served; they were vegetarians;<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Ex. viii. 22.</i> their rice-bread is highly spoken of by our traveller.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Dan. i.</i>
Even from the scanty remarks which we find in his commentaries, we may conclude how attentively he observed everything in the countries through which he travelled. He studied everywhere the character and customs of the people, their dress, and food. He found, <i>e.g.</i>, that the Arab tribes were scrupulously exact in their weights and measures;<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Ex. xxx. 23.</i> that the Hindoos touch the thigh of a person to indicate their submission.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Gen. xxiv. 2.</i> He noticed that the bonnets which the ladies wore in Italy, and the male headgear in Spain, Arabia, Egypt, Babylon, and Bagdad, resembled the mitre worn by the high priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Ex. xxviii. 36.</i> He observed that the food given to Daniel and his companions, instead of the royal dainties, probably consisted of rice and beans, both of which were nourishing and healthy, provided the latter were not French beans, which were of an inferior quality, and injurious to the health.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Comp.

Com. on Num. xiii. 17 ; Ex. xii. 2; Gen. xxxiii. 10. Yesod. Mora, c. 1.</i> and similar interesting observations, show that he made himself well acquainted with the physical, mathematical, and political geography of the various countries through which he passed. It need hardly be said, that the condition of the Jews, the opinion and knowledge which other people had of his brethren, were matters of great interest to Ibn Ezra. A few remarks on that point tell us how strange and sorrowful the results of his researches are, and how much he himself must have suffered as a Jewish traveller.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Is. liii.</i>
A curious anecdote is related in connexion with his travels. It is said, that once when he was on board a vessel with some of his pupils, a raging storm compelled the captain to throw every ninth man of the passengers overboard ; by means of an algebraical formula, which his mathematical knowledge had discovered, he placed himself and his party in such a position that the fatal number never reached one of them; but neither the plan of the captain, nor the counter-plot of Ibn Ezra is sufficiently known.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See R. Mose b. Chabib. Darche Noam.; De Rossi Dizzionario, <i>sub voce</i> Aben Ezra.</i>
His stay in Italy, France, and England, has been enduringly commemorated by his literary productions. In Rome he seems to have unsealed the spring of his knowledge;<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">If he composed any works before he came to Rome, they have remained unknown. The book Moznaïm, quoted in most of the writings of Ibn Ezra seems, at all events, to have been one of his earliest productions.</i> and when once the stream had found its way out of the invisible source, it continued to run incessantly, and poured forth its blessings in abundance. He commenced his literary career by translating a grammatical work of Rabbi Jehudah Hayyug from Arabic into Hebrew. This book paved the way for his independent treatises on Hebrew grammar, which he composed in Rome, Lucca, and Mantua; namely, Moznaïm (balance), Zahoth (elegance of style), Safa Berurah (pure language), and Sefar Hayyesod (the book on the elements of the language).
In Rome he also commenced to write a commentary upon the Scriptures; he began with two books, which on account of their contents seem to have most engaged his philosophical mind—Ecclesiastes and Job. He worthily used the ample opportunities given in these works for the display of his talents, experience, and knowledge. His style and mode of witticism, his principles and arguments, must have been entirely new to his brethren in Italy, where the study of Talmud and Midrash, and the style of Kalir’s poetry seems to have obtained the victory over the exegetical, grammatical, philosophical, and poetical works of the Spanish school. We are not informed how far he succeeded in enlisting among the Italian Jewish communities the attention and respect due to these branches of learning; but this is certain, that he found friends and admirers, who eagerly listened to his instruction, and gladly provided for his livelihood. His books were bought, and he was continually encouraged to write new works.
While in his introduction to Ecclesiastes, he prays to God,
<span>להגיה חשכו, להצליח דרכו, אשר נשאר עד כה, כאלה נבלת</span>
“to enlighten his darkness, to prosper his way, which till then had been strown with withering leaves,” he was able to declare, when about to write the commentary on the book of Lamentations:
<span>הוצאתני מארץ ספרד חמת המציקים</span>
<span>וספרי אלו בגלותי היו בידי מחזיקים</span>
“the wrath of oppressors hath driven me from Spain, and on my wanderings these books have sustained my soul.” As a mark of distinction, and as a token of gratitude, he usually dedicated his work to his principal patron, or a studious pupil, in a few introductory rhymes. Many of these dedicatory epigrams are still extant.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">He wrote the Sefer Haschem for Abraham, the son of Hayim, and Isaac, the son of Jehudah; the Sefath Yether for his pupil Hayim; Yesod Mora he composed for some liberal and noble man in London of the name of Salomon. In the Introduction to the Commentary on Job, the name of the patron to whom the work was dedicated seems to have been omitted.</i>
Besides Rome, he visited other towns in Italy, such as Salerno,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Then celebrated for the medical school established there, which attracted a great many learned and studious people. The question as to the first place visited by Ibn Ezra will be discussed in the third part of this Introduction, in treating of the works of Ibn Ezra.</i> Lucca, and Mantua. In the first named place he seems to have been very much disappointed. He complains of the ignorance of its inhabitants, and of their indifference to science and literature; and traces it to the deficiency and incapacity of the spiritual chief of the congregation, R. Isaac ben Malki Zedek, whose talents Ibn Ezra describes in the following satire :—
“To his ignorant flock he exclaims,
Full well am I versed in Talmudical lore ;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah is divided into six parts:—1. <span>זרעים</span> (lit. “seeds”), containing the laws concerning the daily prayer and benedictions, and laws in connection with agriculture. 2. <span>מועל</span> (“season”): on the Sabbath and festivals. 3. <span>נשים</span> (“women”): on matrimonial laws. 4. <span>נזיקין</span> (“damages”): on civil and criminal law. 5. <span>קדשים</span> (“holy things”): on sacrifices. 6. <span>טהרות</span> (“pure things”); on the distinction between “pure” and “impure.”</i>
He uplifteth his voice, to reach to the clouds,
Yet in the easiest chapters he signally fails.
Even the veriest tyro can discover his errors.
He reads in Taharoth,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The sixth part of the Mishnah, treating of laws in abeyance since the destruction of the Temple, is generally neglected by Talmudists, and is therefore held to be in some measure terra incognita.</i> and knows not his Bible;
Its very beginning, familiar to all, even to a child,
Is a hard task to him.”
The satire is not only directed against this R. Isaac, but also against his adherents, who allowed themselves to be so egregiously deceived. He probably found also in that congregation some noble hearted and intelligent men, who knew how to appreciate his talents, but there was no demand for his works; no one asked him to write a new book.
<span>בכל מקום גרתי ספרים חברתי</span>
<span>וסודות בארתי וכראי מוצקים</span>
<span>ועתה נפלתי לעפר שפלתי ⋯⋯</span>
<span>ופה לא אפתח פי שדי דעתי צמקים</span>
“Wherever I have stayed, I wrote many books,
And made clear what was hidden, like unto a mirror.
But now am I fallen, to the dust am I lowered;
And my mouth dare I not open here.
My spring of knowledge is sealed up.”
When R. Salomon Parchon,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Salom. b. Abr. Parchon, Aragonensis, Lexicon Hebraicum, ed. Stern, Presburg, 1844. “When I came to Salerno, and noticed that they were not in possession of any of the above-named works, I resolved to write a dictionary,” etc. P. xxii.</i> a pupil of Ibn Ezra, came to that place, it was still very destitute of knowledge of Hebrew literature ; nevertheless a slight improvement seems, in the meantime, to have taken place, since he thought it useful to write a Hebrew grammar and a dictionary there. In Mantua and Lucca, Ibn Ezra was more successful. The latter place called by him (<span>עיר מושבי</span>) his residence, was the birthplace of many of his works. Besides some pamphlets on matters touching astronomy and mathematics, he wrote there his commentary on Isaiah. When suddenly stricken with illness at that place, he vowed in prayer to God, that if recovery from that illness should be vouchsafed to him he would at once undertake to write a commentary on the Pentateuch.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Ginse Oxford, p. xvi.: <span>ונדרתי לאל נדר בחליי לבאר דת סיני בהר נתונה</span> “In my sickness I vowed a vow to the Lord, that I would explain the Law which He revealed on Sinai.”</i> He recovered, and the fulfilment of the vow was not delayed for a moment. Such was his facility in composition, such were his energy and perseverance, that though he was at that time sixty-four years old, he was able to complete the whole work in a very short time. The frequent repetition of phrases like <span>אם יעזרני השם</span>, “If God will assist me,” or “If God will grant me to come so far,”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Com. on Gen. xxii. 1; xxxviii. 8 ; Lev. xxvii. 34.</i> remind us of his dangerous illness, and the debility that for some time remained after his convalescence. The commentary on the Pentateuch known to us, is perhaps not the same as that which was written in Lucca on that occasion, or at least it has not come to us in the same form; it was afterwards revised, rewritten, abridged in some parts, and extended in others. Parts of the various editions of this commentary which he issued are still in existence.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Another commentary exists on Genesis in MS., being much lengthier than the printed one. On Exodus, a shorter commentary has been discovered, and published by Reggio. <span>ביאור על ספר שמות נקרא הקצר</span>. Prague, 1840. Comp. Ginse Oxford, p. xv. (Hebr.) and xviii. (Engl.).</i> When he came to England, whither his fame had preceded him, he was well received, and many scholars, thirsting for his instruction, assembled round him. His impatience did not suffer him to make a long stay. This short visit, however, became memorable by the production of two pamphlets, the one <span>יסוד מורא</span>, “The Foundation of the Fear of the Lord,” a treatise on the study of the Law, and the nature of the Divine commandments; the other, <span>אגרת השבת</span>, “A Letter of the Sabbath,” a treatise on the time when the sacred day really commences. The former he wrote for a certain Salomon, of London, whose liberality, truthfulness, and fear of the Lord he praises in the introduction, saying, <span>חברתיו לנדיב שלמה שלמד לפני ספרים שחברתי לו ומרוב אהבתי אותו הוגעתי נפשי לכתוב לו ספר במצות כי ראיתיו כי הוא איש אמת וישר וירא את יי</span> (I wrote it for the noble Salomon, who studied under me the books which I wrote for him, and in my love for him I took pains to compose for him a book on the divine commandments, for I found him to be a man of truth, upright, and God-fearing).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Yesod.

Mus. is not written by Joseph, the son of Jacob of Maudeville, since the two points, referred to, have been omitted by the later copyist.</i> he also added some remarks to Ibn Ezra’s commentary on the Pentateuch, coming from the same source.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Com. on Ex. xii. 9.</i> Before going to England, and after his return thence, he probably stayed in France. Bezières and Rhodez, two places in the south of France, are mentioned in his works. He received there ample marks of honour and respect from all quarters, especially from the Rabbinical authorities of France, who could appreciate the merits and enter into the spirit of his works.
To some complimentary lines of R. Jacob Tam, Ibn Ezra replies:
<span>ומי הביא לצרפתי בבית שיר, ועבר זר מקום קדש ורמס, ולו שיר יעקב ימתק כמו מן, אני שמש, וחם השמש ונמס</span>
“Who brought the Frenchman to the temple of song,
And allowed a stranger to tread sacred soil ?
And though the poem of Jacob were sweeter than manna,
I am the sun, whose heat makes it melt.”
R. Jacob Tam writes to him :
<span>אבי עזרי ישיבוהו סעפיו אשד נתן ידידו בין אגפיו אני עבד לאברהם למקנה ואקורה ואשתחוה לאפיו</span>
“My father, my help, who guidedst my steps;
I am Abraham’s slave; I bow down and serve thee.”
Ibn Ezra replies:
<span>הנכון אל אביר עם אל ורועם</span>
<span>להשפיל ראש במכתב אל בזוי עם</span>
<span>וחלילה למלאך אלהים אשר יקד וישתחוה לבלעם ׃</span>

Here, in France, he continued his literary career, as it would seem, under happy auspices, and wrote commentaries on several books of the Bible.
Ibn Ezra died seventy-five years old, in Kalahorra, on the frontier of Navarre, as some report,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham Zakuta, in his Sefer Hajjochasin.</i> or in Rome according to other authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Comp. Zunz, Die Monatstage des Kalenderjahres, Berlin, 1872, p. 4.</i> When he felt that death was approaching, he applied to himself the words of the Bible, <span> ואברם בן חמש ושבעים שנה בצאתו מחרן</span>. “And Abram (Ibn Ezra) was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran,” that is, from the troubles of this life (Gen. xii. 4).<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The word <span>חרן</span> is used here in the sense of <span>חרון</span>, “anger,” or “trouble.” According to a statement found in several codices (Cod. Val. No. 39 and No. 249; comp. Sephat Yether, ed. Lipmann, p. 22), Ibn Ezra died on Monday, the 1st of Adar I. 4927 (January 23, 1167), 75 years old. Consequently he was born in 1092. The authenticity of this statement has been impugned, but without effect. The principal objection was taken from a poem which precedes the Sefer Zahoth of I. E., written 1146, and contains the line, <span>ואברהם זקן בעוף נודד מקן</span>, “And Abraham, being old, wandering about, as a bird driven from its nest.” It has been urged that Ibn Ezra could not have been called “old” in the year 1146, if, in 1167, he was 75 years old. But it must not be overlooked, first, that the term “old” has a relative meaning; and Ibn Ezra, although only 54 years old, but worn out by the cares and troubles of his constant exile, might well have applied that expression to himself; secondly, that the poem might have been written by another person, who called Ibn Ezra <span>זקן</span>, “old,” in the sense which that term often has in Hebrew writings, namely, “experienced” and “learned.”</i> From these lines we learn, at the same time, that the name of the grandson of R. Jehudah was not Isaac, the name of Ibn Ezra’s son, and that the daughter of R. Jehudah was therefore not the wife of Ibn Ezra.
