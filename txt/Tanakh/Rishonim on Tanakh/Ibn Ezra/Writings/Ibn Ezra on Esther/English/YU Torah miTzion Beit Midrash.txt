Ibn Ezra on Esther



Chapter 1



Verse 1

To  the  Name  of  Hashem  all  greatness  is proper, He is tremendously exalted above all praise. <br>To Avraham the son of Meir may He send courage, [as he] desires to explain the Megilah. <br> The speech of Avraham the Sefardi who is known as the son of Ezra: [Note: His father’s name was Meir, his family name was “ibn Ezra”.] There is no help [ezra], except for from Hashem, who engraves the laws of the world on the heart of the enlightened one while he is awake, so too in a dream He speaks to him, and on Him he will support [himself] when he begins to do any action, and he will remember Him always before words are uttered by his mouth. Behold, there is no mention of the Name [of G-d] in this scroll, and it is one of the holy books! Many have responded that it is [mentioned]: “[relief and salvation will arise for the Jews]  from    another place”  [<i>mimakom <b>acher</b></i>]. (Esther 4:14) This is incorrect, because Hashem is not known as Makomin any of the holy books, only as Maon [Residence], which is always lofty. Our Sages of blessed memory called Him Makom [“place”], since all places are filled with his honour. Further, what would be the meaning of the word “another” [in mimakom acher]? It  seems correct in my eyes that this book was composed by  Mordechai, and that is the meaning of “And he sent text to all of the Jews,” (Esther 9:30), and all of them were copies of one book, namely, the  Megilah, which is the reason for the term “set text” [patshegen].  The  Persians copied it, and it was written in the chronicles of their kings. They were idol worshippers, and in place of the honourable, awesome Name, they would write the names of their idols, as the Cuthites did, as in place  of “In the beginning of Elokim’s creation” they wrote “In the be-ginning of Ashima’s creation.” Therefore, it was out of honour  to Hashem that Mordechai did not mention Him in the Megilah. [Note – this answer is cited in the name of Rabbi Saadyah Gaon in the Second Version of Ibn Ezra commentary to Esther 4:14.]
