Ibn Ezra on Psalms

Introduction







Chapter 1



Verse 1


Our predecessors, their memory to blessing, said that stood is harder than went and sat is harder than all of them. If so, the insulters will be worse than sinners. And Rabbi Moshe the Kohen explained to the contrary, and said that the intention of did not stand is "didn't even stand". And according to my understanding, that the word wicked are those who do not stand on one standard(?)...

Kiss the son - Behold and serve the Lord in contrast to. . .
. . .Kiss the son against his anointed; and behold the interpretation 'How pure and also how pure my insides' (Proverbs 31:2); and it is also written 'you are my son.' It is a custom in the nations of the world to place their hands under the hand of the king as the brother of Solomon or the slave under the thigh of his master or to kiss the king. This is the custom in India to this day.

Verse 1

A psalm; a song of dedication of the House – There are those who say that David commanded that the singers play this song at the dedication of the First Temple, and those who say at the dedication of the Second Temple or the Third, because he compared the time of exile to a time of sickness as I will explain. It seems to me that he composed this song at the dedication of his own house, the House of Cedars, because the psalm does not mention the House of God. This usage is similar to “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house,” (Samuel II 5:8) as I explained there. At that time David fell sick and then recovered from his sickness. R’ Moshe said that David mourned when Natan told him that he would not build the house for the Lord. When he told him that Shlomo his son would build the house he was clothed with joy in place of his mourning because his son was like him, and his enemies could not disparage him. And he said that suffering of the soul is similar to physical suffering, and even worse in the sense that “A man's spirit will sustain his illness…” (Proverbs 18:14)

Verse 1

"To the conductor, listen to this all nations" - this psalm is very important, because it explains the light of the afterlife (lit. World to come) and the undying soul of wisdom.

Verse 2

"Listen" - to the message he gives, that addresses all in whose nostrils G-d (lit. hashem, the name) blew the breath of life. Therefore, "listen all who dwell on Earth".

Verse 3

"Also" - calling the sons of Adam who aren't wealthy, or who are and are well known. That is the reason for also having "sons of man", to include the rich and the poor.

Verse 4

"My mouth" - to teach all the wisdom hidden from them, which those wise of heart explain by riddles.
And "thoughts and insights" - that my heart thought.

His tabernacle was in Shalem – This is referring to Jerusalem. Perhaps she is called Shalem because she is perfectly positioned opposite the gate of heaven, or that she is fit to be in peace. Or perhaps they called her thus in a prayerful fashion, like “ask for the peace of Jerusalem…” (Tehillim 122:6)

Verse 1


And the word "laanot"-- is like the phrase "qol anot" (Ex. 32:18). Said Yeshua b. Yehuda: "This is Heman the son of Samuel and the Bible calls him Ezrahi because he was a native of the bards, for most bards were his children and grandchildren as it is written in Chronicles." And some say that the aleph is prosthetic and he was the son of Zerah and his brother was Ethan. And others say that Heman and Ethan were brothers whose father was called Ezrah.

Verse 1

I rejoiced when they said to me – R’ Moshe said that David composed this song that it be said with the songs in the House of God when it will be built. R’ Yeshua said that this song was for the House which David built in Zion. There are those that say it refers to the Third House when every member of Israel will say ‘I rejoiced when they said to me’ as they go up for the pilgrimage festivals:

Verse 3

Jerusalem – On the three festivals it was like a city into which all her children gathered from the surrounding area in a time of fear:

Jerusalem has mountains – because they stand around her, and the Lord surrounds His people within her. Therefore the enemy cannot come lay siege to Jerusalem:

Until I find – We know that all of the land is the Lord’s, only there are honored places which are more honored. Therefore “…and this is the gate of heaven.” (Genesis 28:17)

Verse 6

Behold – R’ Moshe (ben Jikatelia) said: we heard it at the hands of David who was from Ephratha. The correct understanding in my eyes is that in days gone by people would say that we heard from the mouth of the prophets that the chosen place is close to Bet Lechem Ephratha. Only, it was unknown whether the place was to the east of Bet Lechem, the west, north or south. It is known that until today there is only a distance of three parsangs between Jerusalem and Bet Lechem: 
in the fields of the forest – where the threshing floor of Aravna the Jebusite is located.

"Open" - and the "you" that's written in the prior verse (Psalm 145:15) is also here, thus [the verse should read] "and You open Your hand," and thus: because the God of my father is my help. 
And the meaning of "will" -- what is sufficient for them.
