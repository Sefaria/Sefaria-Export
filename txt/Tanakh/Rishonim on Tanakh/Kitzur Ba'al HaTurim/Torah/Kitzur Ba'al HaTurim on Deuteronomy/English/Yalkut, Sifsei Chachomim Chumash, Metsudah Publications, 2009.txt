Verse 3

<b>He fed you the <i>mon</i> … in order to inform you. </b>This teaches that eating <i>mon</i> gives them intelligence. Similarly Ezra states, “You also gave Your good spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold Your <i>mon </i>from their mouth” (Nechemia 9:20). This is the meaning of the statement (Yalkus Shimoni Shemos 13): The Torah was only given to those who eat <i>mon</i>.

Verse 8

<b>A land.</b> There are ten words in this verse. Therefore one must place all ten fingers on the bread while reciting the <i>berocho</i>. It also corresponds to the ten <i>mitzvos</i> which are done in preparing bread: You may not plow with an ox and with a donkey together (Devarim 22:10); Do not plant in your vineyard mixed species (Devarim 22:9); Fallen sheaves (Vayikra 19:10); Forgotten sheaves (Devarim 24:19); Leaving the corners of the field (Vayikra 23:22); You may not muzzle and ox while it threshes (Devarim 25:4); <i>Terumah</i> (Bamidbar 15:21); <i>Maaser Rishon</i> (Bamidbar 18:24); <i>Maaser Sheni</i> (Devarim 12:17); <i>Challah</i> (Bamidbar 15:20).

Verse 11

<b>You are to rejoice.</b> The Torah does not associate rejoicing with Pesach, when the crops are still in the fields. With regard to Shavuos, when the grain has been harvested but the grapes are still on the vine, it mentions rejoicing only once. With regard to Sukkos, when everything has already been brought in from the fields, it mentions rejoicing twice.

<b><i>Asherah</i> tree.</b> The numerical value of this term (506) is the same as the value of the phrase, “a judge who is not fitting” [<i>dayan she’aimo hagon</i>]. For anyone who appoints a judge who is not fitting is considered as if he planted an <i>Asherah </i>tree near the altar.  
<b><i>Asherah </i>or any tree near the altar.</b> The numerical value of this phrase (894) is the same as the value of the phrase, “wicked near righteous” [<i>rasha etzel tzadik</i>]

<b>A moon of days.</b> The Torah does not simply state, “month” to teach that just as the light of the moon is inferior to the light of the sun, so too the non-Jew is less desirable than a Jewish woman.

<b>You disregard.</b> The letter <i>yud</i>, with the value of 10, is small, to imply that Hashem gave you Ten Commandments, and you tested Him with ten trials, and also to imply that Hashem should remember Avraham whom he tested with ten tests.

Verse 3

<b>He also [<i>af</i>] cherished the nations.</b> This has the same numerical value as “converts” (geirim). For all the converts who would convert in the future also stood at Sinai… And it uses the term “<i>af</i>” [which can also mean “anger”] because it refers to those who struggle and afflict themselves for the sake of the Torah.
