Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Deuteronomy



Chapter 1



Verse 1

These are the words (1:1) - This is a hint for three times [eleh =  1; devarim, plural, counts as 2]. They were said in Sinai, and were repeated in the Tent of Meeting and were said a third time in the wilderness of Moav, and on each mitzvah 16 covenants were established: 16 on Sinai, 16 in the Tent of Meeting and 16 in the Wilderness of Moav, and that makes for 48; and there are 48 warnings against them in the Torah regarding gerim and 48 times  regarding the ger that comes to cling to Torahin which 48 covenants were established.

23:1 וָאֶתְחַנַן – I Prayed. Written (in the verse) before (vs22) is, לֹא תִירָאוּם, You shall not fear them (3:22). (Moses thought to himself) “I encouraged Israel. Perhaps He will have mercy upon me”
23:2	וָאֶתְחַנַן -- I Prayed. The gematria of this word equals שִׁירָה (song). Moses recited songs before HaShem, so that He would accept his prayers. The phrase הי אֱלֹהֵיכֶם, HaShem your God (vs22) is juxtaposed with וָאֶתְחַנַן to indicate (Moses meant) שִׁוִיתִי הי לְנֶגְדִי תָמִיד, I have set HaShem before me constantly (Tehillim 16:8).

<b>He fed you the <i>mon</i> … in order to inform you. </b>This teaches that eating <i>mon</i> gives them intelligence. Similarly Ezra states, “You also gave Your good spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold Your <i>mon </i>from their mouth” (Nechemia 9:20). This is the meaning of the statement (Yalkus Shimoni Shemos 13): The Torah was only given to those who eat <i>mon</i>.

<b>A land.</b> There are ten words in this verse. Therefore one must place all ten fingers on the bread while reciting the <i>berocho</i>. It also corresponds to the ten <i>mitzvos</i> which are done in preparing bread: You may not plow with an ox and with a donkey together (Devarim 22:10); Do not plant in your vineyard mixed species (Devarim 22:9); Fallen sheaves (Vayikra 19:10); Forgotten sheaves (Devarim 24:19); Leaving the corners of the field (Vayikra 23:22); You may not muzzle and ox while it threshes (Devarim 25:4); <i>Terumah</i> (Bamidbar 15:21); <i>Maaser Rishon</i> (Bamidbar 18:24); <i>Maaser Sheni</i> (Devarim 12:17); <i>Challah</i> (Bamidbar 15:20).

To the place – When one transforms the letters of this phrase through atbash (a code which substitutes the last letter of the alphabet for the first, the second last for the second, etc…) the resultant word has the numeric value of ‘this is Jerusalem’ (Sifre). The numeric value of place (makom) is the same as to Zion (l’tzion).

<b>You are to rejoice.</b> The Torah does not associate rejoicing with Pesach, when the crops are still in the fields. With regard to Shavuos, when the grain has been harvested but the grapes are still on the vine, it mentions rejoicing only once. With regard to Sukkos, when everything has already been brought in from the fields, it mentions rejoicing twice.

<b><i>Asherah</i> tree.</b> The numerical value of this term (506) is the same as the value of the phrase, “a judge who is not fitting” [<i>dayan she’aimo hagon</i>]. For anyone who appoints a judge who is not fitting is considered as if he planted an <i>Asherah </i>tree near the altar.  
<b><i>Asherah </i>or any tree near the altar.</b> The numerical value of this phrase (894) is the same as the value of the phrase, “wicked near righteous” [<i>rasha etzel tzadik</i>]

<b>He also [<i>af</i>] cherished the nations.</b> This has the same numerical value as “converts” (geirim). For all the converts who would convert in the future also stood at Sinai… And it uses the term “<i>af</i>” [which can also mean “anger”] because it refers to those who struggle and afflict themselves for the sake of the Torah.
