Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Deuteronomy



Chapter 1



Verse 1

These are the words (1:1) - This is a hint for three times [eleh =  1; devarim, plural, counts as 2]. They were said in Sinai, and were repeated in the Tent of Meeting and were said a third time in the wilderness of Moav, and on each mitzvah 16 covenants were established: 16 on Sinai, 16 in the Tent of Meeting and 16 in the Wilderness of Moav, and that makes for 48; and there are 48 warnings against them in the Torah regarding gerim and 48 times  regarding the ger that comes to cling to Torahin which 48 covenants were established.

23:1 וָאֶתְחַנַן – I Prayed. Written (in the verse) before (vs22) is, לֹא תִירָאוּם, You shall not fear them (3:22). (Moses thought to himself) “I encouraged Israel. Perhaps He will have mercy upon me”
23:2	וָאֶתְחַנַן -- I Prayed. The gematria of this word equals שִׁירָה (song). Moses recited songs before HaShem, so that He would accept his prayers. The phrase הי אֱלֹהֵיכֶם, HaShem your God (vs22) is juxtaposed with וָאֶתְחַנַן to indicate (Moses meant) שִׁוִיתִי הי לְנֶגְדִי תָמִיד, I have set HaShem before me constantly (Tehillim 16:8).
