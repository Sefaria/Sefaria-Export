Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Leviticus



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>And He called.</b> The א of ויקרא is written as a small letter because Moshe wanted to write ויקר (and it happened), the way it is written regarding Bilaam, which implies God appeared to him only as a chance occurrence. God, however, told him to write the א which indicates His love, but Moshe made it small.

<b>The fat.</b> This is because it comes to atone for the sin committed due to having become fat, as it says (Devarim 32:15): And Yeshurun became fat and rebelled; you grew fat, thick and rotund. Therefore, he brings the fat as if he offered up his own fat.

<b>And he blessed them.</b> The three blessings of the Kohanim (Bamidbar 6, 24-26) correspond to three types of offerings: The first blessing corresponds to sin offerings, “and may He guard you” — from sin, as it says (Shmuel I 2:9), “The feet of His pious ones He will guard”; “May he cause His face to shine” corresponds to the burnt offering [<i>olah</i>], as it says (Shemos 34:24), “When you go up [<i>ba’aloscha</i>] to see”; “peace” corresponds to the peace offerings.
