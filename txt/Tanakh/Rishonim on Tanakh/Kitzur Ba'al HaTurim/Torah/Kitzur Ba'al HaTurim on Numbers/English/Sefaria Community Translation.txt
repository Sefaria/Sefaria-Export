..."Thus shall you bless" - the word thus (Heb. koh) comes to remind us of the merit of the verse "the boy and I will walk thus far" (Gen. 22) and also "thus shall be your offspring" and also "thus The LORD has blessed me."  The two letters that comprise the word "thus" in Hebrew, kaf and hey, make 25 and there are 25 letters in the Shema, the word blessing appears 25 times in the Torah and also the word peace appears 25 times.  This is why the Priestly Blessing starts and finishes with the word peace and that is the meaning of "The LORD will bless His people with peace." 
Amor Lahem = tell them (God commands Moses to tell the Kohanim): Tell = Amor, the word "amor" (from the verb leemor = say) is complete, [that is written with Vav for the vowel "o". And the letter Vav is the number 6]. This represents the 6 blessings [that the Kohanim will say]: Yebarejejá, Veishmereja, Yaer, Vijuneka, Isá, Shalom. It also represents [6 virtues of God that are found in Psalm 19: 8-10]. Torah of God, Testimony of God, Instructions of God, Commandments of God, Fear of God, Judgments of God.

זאת חקת התורה "This is the law of the Torah": According to the constitution of the Torah, you should drink the milk from it, a hint that the Torah was not given except to those who ate the manna, a second one to those who ate a terumah, and another hint that those who hold the Torah of God have portions that do not give terumah (a donation to serve, as priestly dues from produce; contribution to be set apart for priests) as priests with the land:
לא תחללו  "You will not be cursed":  And the constitution of the Torah affirmed that a person who sins is blasphemy:
ולא תמותו "And you will not die":  And the Law of the Torah, written in the Etz Haim (the Tree of the Life), is for those who hold it:
פרה אדומה "red cow": in gematria is about the sin of a (golden) calf: (Ex. 32:4)
He didn't get on her
  About a missing spelling that didn't even pull the yoke but was only invalid:
