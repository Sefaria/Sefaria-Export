Verse 1

<b>In the end of days.</b> See Rashi. When the Divine Presence departed he was concerned that his sons were tainted with sin, but they pointed out that the root letters of the word <i>cheit</i> — “sin” — do not even appear in their names. He replied that neither do the letters comprising <i>keitz</i> — “the end [of days]”.
