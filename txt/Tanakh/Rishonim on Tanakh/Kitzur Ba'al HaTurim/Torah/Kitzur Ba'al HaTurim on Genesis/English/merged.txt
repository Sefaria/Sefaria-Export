Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>In the beginning, created:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'On Rosh Hashanah was created (the world).' <i>Bereishit</i> (In the beginning) is the acronym of <i><b>be</b>rishona <b>ra</b>ah <b>E</b>lohim <b>she</b>yikablu <b>yi</b>srael <b>T</b>orah</i> (first God saw that Israel would accept the Torah). The last letters of <i>Bereishi<b>t</b> bar<b>a</b> Elohi<b>m</b></i> (In the beginning, God created) form the acronym, <i>emmet</i> (truth), [which] teaches that God created the world with truth, as it is stated (Psalms 119:160), "The beginning of Your word is truth;" and so [too], there are many verses, which the last letters of of its words form the acronym, <i>emmet</i>. 

Verse 2

<b>And the spirit of God was hovering:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'this is the spirit of messiah.'

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>The light:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'in the Torah' and adds up to six hundred and thirteen (the traditional numerical sum of the Torah's commandments).
<b><i>E<u>t</u> haoh<u>r</u> k<u>i</u> to<u>v</u></i> (the light, that it was good):</b> The last letters [of which] form the acronym, <i>brit</i> (covenant). <b>And God saw the light that it was good and He separated:</b> From here [we learn], that we do not make a blessing on the candle [at the Havdalah (separation) service] until we derive use from its light; and [that last phrase] adds up to the numerical equivalent of 'and He separated - we separate during the year at the end of the Shabbats.'

Verse 5

5 times the word 'light' is written in this section, representing the 5 books of the Torah which are called LIGHT... [<b>Five</b> times '<i>Or</i>' is written in the parashah, against <b>five</b> Torah Pentacles called <i>Or</i> ]

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>From above the firmament:</b> There are two [places this appears] according to the tradition: here and the other is (Ezekiel 1:25), "and there was a voice from above the firmament," in the chariot [apparition] of Ezekiel. And in the same way that we don't teach about 'the story of creation' in public, so [too] do we not teach about 'the story of the chariot' [in public].

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><u>Ma</u>zria <u>ze</u>ra <u>le</u>mineihu (that gives off seed according to its species):</b> forms the acronym, <i>mazal</i> ('constellation'); as there is no grass that does not have a 'constellation' above [governing] it.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>Luminaries (<i>meorot</i>):</b> is [written in its] incomplete spelling [meaning that it lacks the letter <i>vav</i>], since only the sun was created to give light. And the moon was only created so that [people] would not worship the sun, [which might have been the case] had it been alone.

Verse 22

<b>And the birds:</b> There are three [places this appears] according to the tradition: [here, where it states,] "and the birds shall increase;" "and the birds ate them" (Genesis 40:17); "this is the law of the beasts and the birds" (Leviticus 11:46). [This is] a hint to that which they said (Chullin 63b), "pure birds are more numerous than impure birds;" this is [what is alluded to by] "and the birds shall increase," meaning that they will be more, [but] which? "And the birds ate them," meaning those that are pure, and so [too], "this is the law, etc." refers to the pure ones.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>Haadam</i> (man):</b> [has the same] letters [as] <i>adamah</i> (earth), since he was created from the earth. <i>Adam</i> is the acronym of <i><b>e</b>fer, <b>da</b>m, <b>ma</b>rah</i> (ash, blood, bile).

Verse 28

<b>And have dominion (<i>ouredu</i>) upon the fish of the sea:</b> There are two [places this appears] according to the tradition: here and the other is "and go down (<i>ouredu</i>) to Gat of the Philistines" (Amos 6:2). If you will have merit, you will have dominion even over the fish of the seas; but, if not, you will go down to Gat; meaning to say, you will be subjugated to the Philistines.

Verse 29

<b>Fruit of the tree (<i>pri etz</i>):</b> There are two [places this appears] according to the tradition: [here, where it states,] that has within it the fruit of the tree;" [and] "fruit of a beautiful tree" (<i>pri etz hadar</i>) [in Leviticus 23:40]. This is a hint for the opinion that holds that the tree that Adam ate from here was a citron (<i>etrog</i>) [since that is what the verse in Leviticus refers to]. 
<b>Male:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'blessing.' Female has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'in a curse.' 

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i><u>Y</u>om <u>ha</u>shishi <u>va</u>yekhulu <u>ha</u>shamayim</i> (the sixth day. And He finished the skies):</b> [forms] the acronym of [God's] name [that consists] of four letters, with which he [here] sealed the story of creation. And so [too in Psalms 96:11] "<i><b>yi</b>smechu <b>ha</b>shamayim <b>ve</b>tagel <b>ha</b>arets</i>" ("Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice") [forms] the acronym of [God's] name [that consists] of four letters, with which he [also] sealed the world, with the name of four letters.

Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>ויכל אלהים "And all God is,"</b>  <i>Targum Yerusalmi</i> says this about grace, This is what they said the "grace" in there. In this case, there were 3 verses of his works for 3 works that returned, which are the heavens and the earth, and the sea. And there is no writing that says, "there was an evening and there was a morning" on the seventh day, according to Musaf adds "to rest upon one as a duty is sacred."
<b>וישבות "and rested"</b> There are 2 separate Tanakh teachings according to "And the manna dwells." And we were to write in this case the Manna that the Lord spoke the Sabbath on the holy Sabbath, and we do not find that Moses told them this beforehand, but it is alluded to in God the days of Genesis and the rest on the seventh day and the rest of the <i>Manna</i>. Another thing teaches that Manna ruled out worship on Sabbath as evidenced in <i>Kiddushin</i>. Another thing alluded to what they demanded: bless them with manna and sanctify them with manna.

Verse 3

<b>ויברך אלהים "And <i>Elohim</i> blessed"</b> There are 3 different teachings about s’mikhai (<i>Blessings</i>) , And <i>Elohim</i> blessed Noaĥ(Gen 9:1). And on the other hand, "<i>Elohim</i> blessed Isaac. (Gen 48:15, Gen 25:11)" At the time when the world was created in the blessing of the Sabbath (Gen 2:3) and the world and in the days of Noah when all the first ones were lost and the world was renewed, it was necessary to bless a second time and blessed Isaac as it is in the <i>Midrash</i> until now I needed to bless my creation from now on the blessings will be entrusted to you.

Verse 4

<b>בהבראם</b> In the word <i>where created</i> there are the same letters that are in Abraham (הבראם\אברהם), thanks to Abraham, heaven and earth were created. 
<b>ארץ ושמים "earth and heavens"</b> there are 2 teaching parts in Tanakh, "Thank you for heaven and earth (Ps. 148:13)." Why did they thank the earth and the heavens instead of the one who made the earth and the heavens?

Verse 5



Verse 6

 ואד "until that" there are 2 separate Tanakh teachings about this, "and his wife beset with (אֵ֗יד) calamity (Job 18:12)." An allusion to what many of us said, remember them as a blessing, why is his name called ´Eid (אֵ֗יד - calamity)? It was because of that the nations break their hearts, so that the Holy One, blessed be He, will give them rain.

Verse 7

וייצר "and He made" there is 2. cases one accurate and one lack of accuracy, And the Lord God created man. It is full that he has two creations, the creation of good and the creation of evil, and the Lord God created from the earth every beast of the field. Lacking that they have but one creation.
ויפח באפיו נשמת חייםAnd breathed into his nose the breath of life, a sealed prayer arrangement.
נשמת "soul" the words that he breathed in his nostrils a soul, all that is a spirit of life, the candle of God is the soul of man, and if not, the soul of God is like a stream of brimstone.
האדם לנפש חיה "human becomes a living soul", the initials chalah (the sanctification [of creation]), which was the chalah of the world(Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah 1:6:5). 

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

יפרד "will break up" There are 2 separate teachings in Tanakh "but a poor man is parted from his fellow [by his poverty] (Prov. 19:4)." When the first man became deficient in unleavened bread, he was separated from the garden.

Verse 11



Verse 12

הבדלח "the bdellium" there are 2 separate Tanakh teachings about this, "and in color, it was like bdellium (Numb. 11:7)." This teaches that good stones and marbles came down with the manna.

Verse 20

ולאדם לא מצא עזר "And Adam found no helper" 3. different places teach us: And to Adam, he said that you have listened to your wife's voice (Gen. 3:17). And to the man who did not labor, his portion will be reduced (Ecc. 2:21), and to the man, he had no helper, and God did a favor with him and created the woman as a helper, and he sinned by her, and that's it. And to the man, he said, Because you have heard that you have sinned by the helper, therefore, and to the man who did not labor in it, his portion will be given to him for which the penalty of death will be given*. [*Look: Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 10:1:12]

Verse 21

ויפל ה' אלהים  "And God HaShem caused to fall in" 3. separated teachings: "and cast it upon him and he died (Numb 35:23)". "And He made them fall in the midst of their camp (Psalm 78:28)."  It is that Dajjal (the demon) in one who killed by mistake and one who kills maliciously that the Holy One, blessed be He, congregates in one inn and he goes up the ladder and everything and that's it and he will fall among his camp that the Holy One, blessed be He, has appointed in his camp.
ויסגור "and will close" there are 2. separated places in Tanakh teaching: "And יהוה shut him in (Gen 7:16)", an allusion to the closing of meat which prohibited the use of staff for the stretch out from the ark (to close the door), when God closed on his behalf and the flesh was closed in (the Ark). 

Verse 22

ויבאה "and came"  The writings were missing, and she cries and says about my writings, she decorated them, and she did decorate my writings and brought them to me. [edit. I suspect this example was R' Jacob's life, his wife?]. And I will explain things in the tradition (Mesorah) and things that were brought to Adam. "Isaac then brought her into the tent... (Gen 24:67)", "...and brought her to the City of David... (I King 3:1)", "Hence the LORD was intent upon bringing calamity upon us (Dan 9:14)". Their predecessor who carried Pharaoh's daughter from above and this example of first Adam was banished by the `Elionim (The Superior one) cause of Chavah (Eve), And in Yitzchak it was the opposite because she (Rebecca) was in Sarah's place (blessing returned), it is said in the Midrash (Ber. Rab. 60:16). 

Verse 23

"לזאת" [for this] is a phrase that appears in the traditional commentaries. Here and elsewhere, my heart is filled with anxiety. This is to say that Chavah was the cause of Adam's anxiety.

Verse 24

"And they shall become one flesh" and it is juxtaposed with "And the two of them were naked" as a hint to what they said, that he should bring out his document and she should bring out her document.

Chapter 3

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

"לעינים" [to the eyes] in the tradition means that the man saw with his eyes. And furthermore, things that are pleasing to the eye, such as light, are good for the eyes, while smoke is harmful to the eyes. Therefore, the man saw with his eyes and according to his sight, the fruit appeared sweet and pleasing to the eyes. However, in the end, it was like smoke in the eyes, causing death for all.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

"Hamin" (המן) - In this context, it refers to the tree from which Adam ate, also known as the Tree of Knowledge. In other interpretations, it may refer to a specific rock, grain, or winepress. Some say that the tree from which Adam ate was a wheat tree, which would make it the same as the "hamin hagoren" (המן הגורן), the grain from the threshing floor. Just as death was imposed on Adam for eating from the Tree of Knowledge, similarly, death was imposed on him for eating from the other "hamin".
"Which I commanded you not to eat from it" - In this context, it refers to the sin of listening to the advice of a slanderer, as opposed to the direct commandment from God not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge.

Verse 12

"And the man said, 'The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate.'" In this verse, the Scripture indicates that one repays evil for good. "She," the woman, was a good helpmate for him, which he received from God.
"She gave me from the tree, and I ate," according to the simple meaning, he was seduced by the tree until he heard its words.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

"עקב" (heel) - both this interpretation and the other one [that עקב means "because"] are valid. [The phrase] "He will bruise your head" emphasizes [God's] punishment [of the serpent], and "you will bruise his heel" refers to the serpent's treachery. This is why our sages said [in reference to the verse in Job 18:10]: "The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way." This refers both to the serpent, who was cursed to crawl on the ground, and to the Evil Inclination, who seeks to ensnare man in his ways. Similarly, when Jacob blesses his sons, he compares Judah to a lion and Naphtali to a deer, but then blesses them all together with one blessing, stating that each one should be like his respective animal in strength and agility. This is why it says, "And he shall bruise your head" - even though the likeness of Dan is to a serpent, he too is included in the same blessing.

Verse 16

"Greatly increase" in the text here and elsewhere means "I will greatly increase your offspring." The explanation of "your pain" is "the blood of menstruation," hinting at the saying that every woman whose blood is abundant, her children will be abundant.

Verse 17



Verse 18

"And thorns and thistles shall it cause to grow for you" - Concerning the Land of Israel, it is said among the Gentiles that they are like thorns and thistles for Israel. The hint here is that the thorns and thistles refer to the Gentiles, which will grow for you.

Verse 19



Verse 20

"And he called his wife's name Eve" - named after the joy (חוה) that she brings, and this is why it is said that ten measures of speech descended to the world, and nine were taken by women.

Verse 21

"And He dressed them" (Genesis 3:21). As for Aaron, "And He dressed them with tunics" (Leviticus 8:13). This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, made clothes of priesthood for Adam. It is also stated in Genesis Rabbah that the firstborns and the priests served in these garments, and there are eight letters in this verse corresponding to the eight garments of the priesthood.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

The word "לשמר" can be interpreted as a hint or a mnemonic for the phrase "לילין שדין מזיקין רוחין" which means "at night, demons are harmful."

Chapter 4



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

The word "תשוקתו" in this context means "his desire." Another interpretation is "his urge." The verse in Genesis 4:7 is saying, "His desire is toward you, but you must master it." In the Midrash, it is explained that there are two desires: the desire of the wicked for sin, as it says "and to you shall be his desire," and the desire of the Holy One, blessed be He, for the people of Israel, as it says "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; he feeds among the lilies."

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

"Crying out" - In one version of the tradition it says "and also they cry out..." Rashi explained there that it teaches that he (Pharaoh) contracted leprosy and was slaughtering Jewish infants and washing himself with their blood, and this (the infants' blood) is the voice of your brother's blood crying out. (Genesis 4:10)

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

The word "מוצאי" in Genesis 4:14 means "my banishment" or "my exile". In the Talmudic interpretation, it is explained as "For the righteous, [God] showed them the place of their burial, but for the wicked, he did not; rather, it is said of them: 'my exile is too great to bear'." This is why the sages said to those on the right, "Hold the cup of life," and to those on the left, "Hold the cup of suffering." This is the meaning of the verse "whoever finds me will kill me."

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

"Behold, in the heavens there is a solitary judge's plea" in gematria is equal to Enoch, and the Tetragrammaton in gematria is equal to Metatron, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, took one from those of the previous generation of the Flood and one from those of the later generation of the Flood, namely Enoch and Pinchas, and concealed them in heaven to bear witness about Him. He chose Enoch, who was of the seventh generation, since the Holy One, blessed be He, desired the seventh [generation]. Similarly, it is written of Moses, who was of the seventh [generation] from the Patriarchs, "And Moses ascended to God [Elohim]."

Chapter 5



Chapter 6



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

"The Nephilim" - three in tradition, one complete and two deficient. The Nephilim were on the earth. Deficient, and we have seen them named Nefilim. Complete, the sons of Anak were from the Nephilim. Deficient, and this is Sihon and Og, etc., as stated in Niddah. Sihon and Og were the sons of Shamhazai and Azazel, and they fell from the sky during the days of the Flood. Therefore, it is written here "The Nephilim were on the earth," deficient.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

"Eleh toledot Noach" - The verse is connected to "Eleh toledot hashamayim" (These are the generations of the heavens), "Eleh toledot Shem" (These are the generations of Shem), and "Eleh toledot Yaakov" (These are the generations of Jacob). In all of them, "Eleh toledot hashamayim" (These are the generations of the heavens) precedes, representing the creation of the world. "Eleh toledot Noach" (These are the generations of Noach) refers to the generations that preceded him. "Eleh toledot Shem" (These are the generations of Shem) refers to the descendants of Cham and Yefet. "Eleh toledot Yaakov" (These are the generations of Jacob) refers to the descendants of Esau and his chiefs.
"Noach, Noach, etc." - The word "Noach" is repeated three times in the verse to indicate that he saw three worlds. According to one interpretation, Noach was one of three who saved three individuals each. Noach saved his three sons, Shem, Cham, and Yefet. Daniel saved Chananiah, Mishael, and Azariah in a dream. Job saved his three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. According to another interpretation, "Noach" refers to the heavens, the creatures, the upper beings, the lower beings, the present world, and the world to come.
"Noach was a perfect man" - The word "hayah" (was) is spelled with a "heh," which represents the number 5, indicating that he was perfect in all five aspects of his life from Adam to Abraham. However, after Abraham, no one is considered perfect.
"Noach walked with God" - This is an expression of praise, indicating that Noach was a wise man. It is similar to the expression used in Job 12:13, "With Him are wisdom and strength."


Verse 10



Verse 11

"ותמלא הארץ" [And the earth will be filled] - Both midrashim here and there explain that "and the earth was filled" refers to them [the angels]. For the earth itself was filled with them, for they [the angels] would be born six to a patch of land, then they would be swallowed into the ground and afterwards crack and emerge. Additionally, the earth itself was filled with theft; people would entrust their purses with a friend and a perfumer would accompany him. The one entrusted with the purse would place it, together with his treasures, under the ground with the perfumer. The one who entrusted the purse would then come at night, smell the perfume, and take everything.
"חמם"[To be hot] has the numerical value of "Mei Noach" (the waters of Noah), which teaches that Pharaoh was punished measure for measure. "Hamess" has the numerical value of "Gehinnom" (hell), which teaches that the wicked are judged in boiling hot water.

Verse 12



Verse 13

ויאמר אלהים 'לנח קץ כל בשר... And God said, 'To rest the end of all flesh, he hinted at the days of the flood, which are like the end of a day of rain and a day of reinforcement. 
כי מלאה הארץ חמס מפניהם... for the earth is filled with lawlessness because of them, in Gematria: illicit sexual intercourse/i.e. incest. 
והנני... In the Tanakh there are 3 parallels in this: I am about to destroy them (Gen. 6:31). And so I propose to build a house for the Shiloh (means "Messiah")(I Kings 5:19)  am just gathering a couple of sticks (I Kings 17:12). The Holy One, blessed be He, said, I will rebuild the established world and spoiled their actions. And I spoil them and I am about to destroy them to tell you that not a single tree was left standing, but all were uprooted. 
משחיתם... "destroy them" In Gematria: She will slap with an open hand. 
?
משחיתם את הארץ... "about to destroy them" our Rabbi Tam (רבנו תם = ר''ת) Ma´ah teaches you that you destroyed their height, which was a hundred cubits high. (Transl. KK)

Verse 14



Verse 15

וזה אשר תעשה And you shall do this... this Occurs two times, like here another time "and you shall do this on the altar" (Exodus 29:38) and to say that just as the altar atones, so you should build an altar to atone for when you come out (in this verse Gen 6:15).

Verse 16

1. צהר, Tzohar, window, opening in Gematria: In the light of the stone. 
ושלשים... In this case in Tanakh 2 parallel verses are according to this, And "in distress" אידך (Prov. 27:10) and "thirty will march" ושלשים יסעו (Numb. 2:24). An allusion to the Star of David is that the flags traveled in square writing through the land that thanks to the flags were saved. Do it and I trust and I will do it to say that I will assist you in doing it otherwise he would not have been able to do it.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

1 Bring to life in a doubled* (*מהעוף bird can mean also, to be bent, doubled; to be wearied) with you a male and a female of the of its kind. He hinted to him that the bird* would live with him and this is what the scripture said and he sent the dove, away from him, to study if there was a place of dwelling for him: (This part of the commentary seems to apply also to verse 20 cause word מהעוף appears in there)
2 "to preserve life with you..." In Gematria: "no predation" or "no missing limb."

Verse 20



Verse 21

"and to them..." there are 3 connected verses in Tanakh in this case, and did Yosef "and to them" (II Kings. 3:22 כדם) "as red as blood"(Judges 6:5). And they and their camels have no number. As like did Yosef ate by himself and the Egyptians by themselves [Gen 39:6 except for the bread that he ate: Since the Egyptians did not eat with foreigners (see, for instance, Gen. 43:32).], it was like Noah and his sons and the animals and the beasts, each given alone to each given his food, (Gen. 24:33, 34) and it was she to them and their camels who put a branch in the shelter and food for the camels, as well as for every body in company.

Verse 4

היקום אשר עשיתי "existence that I created" in Gematria "No life to the resurrection."
היקום The existence... there are 3 parallel verses in Tanakh: And I wiped out the whole universe. (Gen. 7:23) All existence on earth was blotted out. (Deut. 11:6) and the whole universe at their feet. To say that just as the generation of the flood sinned because of the abundance of favors and wealth that they had, so did a קרח (Korach Tosefta, Sanhedrin XIII, 9, Rab. Bah. 16:1:8) from the abundance of wealth that he had remained and sinned.

Verse 11

בשבעה עשר יום לחודש "on the seventeenth day of the month" And they will spend their days as well as the month when the flood came down. and the sky chimneys. In Gematria: "who took two stars from Kima."

Verse 1



Verse 2

ויכלא הגשם there are 2 different Tanakh places: On the other hand, So the people were restrained from bringing (Exo. 36:6). If I may say, walk in my the protecting influence of good conduct Israel's great assembly, to make the earth fruitful. 

Verse 3

ושוב "and again" 3 separate Tanakh places; And the rest which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth(Gen 8:7). And the living creatures ran and returned (Ezek 1:14). It is he who said that the fear of the animals comes out like A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him (Daniel 7:10). 

Verse 4

ותנח "and rested" is 2 times on Tanakh, "And the ark rested." "and the spirit rested upon them (Num 11:26)." To say that the Holy Spirit rested on those who remained in the ark and that is it "And the spirit rested on them."
Ararat appears 3 separate times in writings: So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed etc (II Kings 19:36), as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, etc. and they escaped into the land of Ararat (II Kings 19:37). And our sages said their memory is a blessed: "Sennacherib went and found a beam from Noah’s ark, from which he fashioned a god. He said: This beam is the great god who delivered Noah from the flood." (Sanh 96a:1). It is a wrong said about blank. נסרוך = "Nisrokh" (deity) sounds same in language like "nasor" = "plank" (Sandh. Gem. 96a:3)

טרף "Torn" 2. separated Tanakh places: At the other hand, for he has torn, and he will heal us (Hosea 6:1). What is the point of such a broken tongue? He mentioned that she broke it from the tree and "did not find" (Lev. 25:28) it floating on the water, and by this, he knew that the water was diminishing.

וירח at Tanakh are 2 different places that teach, "smelled the sweet scent" as burning. And that's what they demanded of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, even the rebels of Israel in the future, Let them give a scent and that is he and the moon the smell of his clothes Ibn Tibon his clothes but in his clothes and the Lord gave the smell of the fragrance that they will give a scent of the fragrance. Another thing hinted that the smell of heaven entered with him when (Yitzak says from Yakov) "the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed" (Gen 27:27) 
מנעריו From the youth in 3 different places in Tanakh teaches "a man of war from his youth (I Sam. 17:33)." "Mo᾽av has been at ease from his youth (Jer 48:11)." From his youth, a man must fight with the evil inclination and if he overcomes him and his victory is that he is Moab from his youth, "and he has settled on his lees (Jer 48:11)."

ואך "And surely" there are 3 Tanakh places in tradition, Howbeit, if the land of your possession is unclean (Joshua 22:19). but only that word (Numb 22:20). To say just as it is forbidden to kill oneself so it is forbidden to curse oneself and it is your blood for your souls and the thing that even the bee will demand. But if it is impure to say that from every animal we have required sin between impure and pure.

Our sages demanded from where did the planting come from Heaven, just as Abraham took the bush from Heaven.

יאמר "It is said in the secret (mystical) tradition: Therefore, it is said 'like Nimrod', therefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, and regarding Zion, it is said 'every one that is born in her', which teaches that Nimrod was a man of war who captured cities, as it is written 'And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel'. This is why it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, and regarding Zion, it is said that every one who is born there should be brave and stand tall like Nimrod, so that it will be noticeable and people will say, 'this one was born in Zion'."

Chapter 11



Verse 1

 "words" (דברים) and "meaningless words" (הבלים) are mentioned twice in the verse, indicating that the people spoke both meaningful and meaningless words. 
שפה אחת, "one language", in Gematria [this corresponds to] לשון הקדש "the holy tongue" [= Hebrew]. [the value of  שפה אחת is 794, that of לשון הקדש is 795, which is 794 plus 1 added for its totality]

Verse 2

occurs 2 times in the Tanakh as follows: "When they traveled from the camp, our rabbi, may his memory be blessed, explained thus: 'That day they turned away from God.' It is equivalent to this saying: "a child who runs away from scriptures." This means that when they traveled east, they were moving away from "the beginning of the world," the place where "God originally created the world."

Verse 3

איש אל רעהו הבה "Man, come to his neighbor." "A Torah scroll that is incomplete [missing letters] should be set aside in order to promote peace, because of the great peace that would result from correcting it." 
לאבן "Into Stone" Appears 2 times in Tanakh"And his heart died within him, and he turned into a stone. Regarding the incident of Nabal (in 1 Samuel 25), just as there it says "death," so too here it means death. But in this case, it was a death that was even harder for them than death itself, when the moon fell from the tower (of Babel)."

"And the people scattered from him" [1 Samuel 13:11], and our Sages of blessed memory said that the people of the Tower and the people of Egypt were both deserving of punishment, and some were scattered from the Tower and some from Egypt, and this is the meaning of "and the people scattered from him."...
ויחדלו "Vay'chadaloo" (And they ceased) - In the second explanation, "And they ceased" refers to the voices and hail. This teaches that even they (the Egyptians) were punished with the voices and hail.

Verse 9



Verse 10

שנתים אחר "Shnayim Achar" in Sefer Smichut, here and there: "Two years after the noise". Meaning two years before the earthquake. Just as there was a great noise during the flood [in the time of Noah], there was also a great noise before the earthquake.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

לך לך "Lech Lecha" "Go forth" opens with a statement in the language in which the world was created, as the world was created with ten sayings, and it was created solely through the merit of Abraham. Therefore, a statement is written about him.
לך לך "Lech Lecha" "Go forth" is a hint to Abraham that when he will be one hundred years old, he will have a son, Isaac, who will be like a nation to him. Alternatively, it hints to him that after he leaves his land, he will live like the numerical value of "Lech Lecha," as his age was 75 when he left and lived 100 years more. Alternatively, it hints to him about the two exiles that the people of Israel will go through twice. Alternatively, it hints to him that after nine generations, the people of Israel will go into exile during the days of King Zedekiah. And due to Abraham's merit, because God spoke with him when he was 75 years old, they will return after seventy years. Therefore, he relied on going to Haran and moving on to Canaan, as the furnace of the Holy One, blessed be He, was in Haran, and the people of Israel will go into exile. ["Go, yourself," A hint to him, "When you will be 100 years old (30+20+30+20), then I will make you a great nation." For then Isaac will be born.]

Verse 2

"ואעשך לגוי גדול וגו'" is a verse from Genesis 12:2, where God promises Abraham, "And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing." Here, it is explained that this verse is the basis for seven blessings (or "brachot") that are recited during Jewish wedding ceremonies. These blessings are: "And I will make of you a great nation" - the blessing of greatness and prosperity, "And I will bless you" - the blessing of wealth and success, "And make your name great" - the blessing of fame and recognition, "You yourself shall be a blessing" - the blessing of happiness and joy, "And I will bless those who bless you" - the blessing of protection and safety, "And him who curses you I will curse" - the blessing of justice and fairness, "And all the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you" - the blessing of universal impact and influence.
"אשר אראך" (which I will show you) - In tradition, this phrase is expounded as follows: "במסורה הכא ואידך" (here and there in tradition), in Zechariah, regarding the Babylonian exile, it teaches that God showed Abraham the future exiles.
"The word 'arach' as a gematria [numerical value of Hebrew letters] in the clouds teaches that there were clouds going before him and showing him the way. And I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great. Three blessings corresponding to the three blessings of the priests, and so I bless you with three shields upon you, to tell you that the letters gimmel, peh, and kuf are equal to the letters samech, corresponding to the blessings of the priests, and they will bless you, may He illuminate and uplift you, and I will bless you, with the gematria of Abraham."
"And it shall be" is a six in numerology and it shall be a blessing. And it shall be perfect. And it shall be fitting to check. Go up to the mountain and it shall be there. And it shall be for me a father. And it shall be for us a father. If you will be perfect and fitting, then there shall be a blessing, and go up to the mountain, and it shall be for me a father.

Verse 3

"And I will bless those who bless you" has the same gematria as the priests who bless your children. Therefore, when people bless you, it should be in the plural form, and when they curse you, it should be in the singular form.
"And he who curses you, I will curse" has the same gematria as Balaam, who came to curse your children....
'And I will bless' is the first and the second in the tradition, and I will bless your name forever. Blessing that has no end, and this is it: 'And I will bless your name forever'.

Verse 13

'My sister you are' is the first and the second in the tradition, and as for 'sister you are', it means to say that both Abraham and Sarah were great in wisdom.

"And for you" in the text here and there: "Behold, Rebecca is before you, take and go." Drive and go with Avishag the Shunammite, which teaches that she was righteous like the matriarchs, and "Take my staff in your hand and go." The one who revealed it to you, take it in your hand and go. This teaches that even though it is not explained here that he gave him gifts like with Abimelech, he certainly gave him, and this is "take it in your hand and go," meaning he gave him something that can be given immediately by hand.

"ולא נשא" in both instances: "And David did not count their number, and their wealth was beyond measure."
["ולא נשא" literally means "and not counted" or "not enumerated". In the context of the passage, it is referring to the great wealth of David and his followers which was so vast that it could not be counted or enumerated]

Verse 7

"רועי" in the tradition here and there: And my shepherds did not inquire about my flock. This teaches that he rebuked them for not tending to the flock properly, and as a result, there was strife. And this is what is meant by "and my shepherds did not inquire about my flock."

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

The verse "ויפרדו איש מעל אחיו אברם" (Genesis 13:11) means that Abram and Lot separated from each other. This separation was made in peace, and it also hinted to Abram that there would be peace for his descendants. This is demonstrated by the verse "אל תצר את מואב" (Deuteronomy 2:9), which prohibits the Israelites from attacking Moab, which was one of the nations that descended from Lot.

Verse 12

"Avram" - In the second verse of this passage, and similarly elsewhere, Avram is Avraham. This is what the sages explained: wherever it says "he" in reference to Avraham, it refers to him from beginning to end, and this is why Avram is Avraham, from beginning to end in his righteousness. Therefore, Avram sat aside to separate from the wicked Lot.

Verse 13

"Men of Sodom" - In the third verse of the section, and similarly, "And you shall be holy men to Me" (Exodus 22:30). And also "And men of perpetuity shall separate transgressors in the land." (Amos 9:10) This means that "men of holiness" refers to the flesh of a live animal that has been torn, and "men of perpetuity" refers to those who were cautious to remain holy and not become impure, and also those who buried the body parts of the dead. The "men of Sodom" were wicked and sinful, as their evil was to prevent travelers from entering their city, and "men of perpetuity" separated transgressors in the land, they were the Sodomites who separated and prevented travelers from entering.
"Sinners" - In the fourth section of the tradition, and similarly, "And break together the sinners and the evildoers, and let those who abandon the Lord be consumed." (Isaiah 1:28) "And sinners shall return to You." (Psalms 51:15) "And sinners in the assembly of the righteous." This means that the "wicked and sinners" are those who are rebellious and sinful, and therefore "sinners and evildoers will be consumed together." However, if they repent, as it is written "And sinners shall return to You," they will be included in the assembly of the righteous, as it is written "And sinners in the assembly of the righteous."


Verse 14

"North, south, east, and west" and regarding Jacob it says "west, east, north, and south." For Abraham, the merit of the sacrifices that were slaughtered in the north began to be shown, and for Jacob, it was shown that through his merit, the sea would be split, as it is written, "And Israel saw the great hand," etc. Israel is referred to as "grandfather."

Verse 15

Verse 17



Verse 18

"And he built an altar there," and the verse following it says, "And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, etc.," indicating that they needed to bring a sacrifice before going to war. As it is written, "Remember all your offerings and accept your burnt sacrifice, Selah. May He grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans. We will shout for joy at your victory and unfurl our banners in the name of our God."

Chapter 14



Verse 1

"And it came to pass in the days of" - this is the connecting phrase. Here and elsewhere it is used to introduce different periods of time. "And it came to pass in the days of the judges." "And it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus," etc. This expression is used in the Midrash to indicate that all of these periods were times of distress.

Verse 5

"And on the fourteenth" - in one verse here and in another verse in 2 Kings 18:13 "And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up." This is to teach you that just as the nations came against Hezekiah and fell into his hand, so did they come against Abraham and fall into his hand.

However, the Holy One, blessed be He, rescued him and saved him from his hand. Similarly, in the book of Ezekiel, the survivor came to me from Jerusalem, saying that the city has been struck.

Verse 14



Verse 15

Translation: "To Damascus" - twice in tradition. Here and also, "And I will exile you beyond Damascus" (Amos 5:27). They were exiled to Damascus because of the sin they committed in Damascus, and this is an obligation that extends to the left of Damascus.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

 "מלך שלם" ("King of Salem") The initial letters of these words spell the name Shem. This teaches that Malchizedek was Shem, the son of Noah

Verse 19

"Blessed be Abram by God Most High" - There are seven verses in the Torah in which blessings are written to the Holy One Blessed Be He. "Blessed be the Lord God Most High" and "Blessed be God Most High" are two of them. "And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham" is another one. "And I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us" is another one. "And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord" is another one. "And thou shalt eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord thy God" is another one. "And Gad said, Blessed be" is another one. In these verses, there are 10 words corresponding to the 10 blessings recited every day, and seven verses corresponding to the seven blessings recited on Shabbat and festivals. And in five of them, the Name is mentioned before the word "Blessed" corresponding to the Five Books of the Torah for which we must bless first. If you add "Blessed be God Most High" to them, they become six, corresponding to the six orders of the Mishnah.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

"HaRimoti" - In both versions, it means "for I have raised." As our sages said (may their memory be a blessing): This is similar to the intention of Potiphar's wife, which was for good, just as Abraham's intention was for the sake of Heaven.

Chapter 15



Verse 1



Verse 2

"Ariri" [stripped,  childless,  bare of children] in the two traditions here, they wrote this man as "Ariri" in the Jehoiachin tradition, because the Jehoiachin exile showed him that Abraham left Ur of the Chaldeans, and they were exiled to the Chaldeans who were in Babylon.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

"And he brought him outside" in gematria equals איצטגנינותך [astrology or horoscope]. This means that your offspring will be like the number of letters in איצטגנינותך [astrology or horoscope.] - which is 25. In other words, your offspring will be as numerous as 25. This is because at the time of the covenant between the pieces, Abraham was 75 years old.
The word "yihyeh" (meaning "it shall be") has the gematria of 30. This teaches us that in every generation there are at least 30 righteous individuals. Similarly, it is said "yihyeh" (it shall be) to teach that in your offspring there will be righteous individuals, as it is said: "And He said to him, 'So shall your offspring be.'" (Genesis 15:5)

Verse 6

"ויחשבה" is mentioned three times in the Torah. Here, it refers to Tamar, who was suspected of prostitution. It also refers to Hannah, who was suspected of being drunk. This is what Rabbi Isaac Luria meant when he said that my portion is with those who are suspected but are not guilty, as Tamar, because she was suspected, was ultimately vindicated and gave birth to Perez and Zerah, from whom kings and prophets descended. Hannah, because she was suspected, was ultimately vindicated and gave birth to Samuel. Therefore, even though they were suspected of being a prostitute or drunk, they are considered righteous. (Commentary by Rabbi Asher ben Yechiel)

Verse 7



Verse 8

"What will I know?" In the context of the prohibition of the Torah. Blessed be His name, the conversation of Isaac arrived at the calculation of 400, and therefore a decree of 400 was decreed upon his children. "What will I know" in the calculation, that two years were added at the end of the years when no man passed in Judah, and seventy were in exile.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

ויהי השמש "And it was the sun" in the tradition. Here and elsewhere "and it was the sun" comes [in the context of destruction]. Corresponding to the two Temples, as it is written (Jeremiah 6:26), "And I will set your suns [i.e. Temple courtyards] and your gates for destruction."

Verse 13

For the phrase 'a stranger' כי גר final letters [י and ר] has the numerical value of 210, which corresponds to the actual years of slavery in Egypt.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

"And generation" two" in the tradition here and another generation comes. The meaning is that one generation leaves when your children leave the land and another generation comes to inherit the land. And the fourth generation will return here. (Note: this is a reference to the prophecy in Genesis 15:16 regarding the Israelites' time in Egypt and eventual return to the Promised Land.)
"(7) And behold a boiling pot, and the face thereof was from the north." Rashi explains that the opposite of "tohu" (void) is "tahor" (pure). This vision of the boiling pot showed Jeremiah the exiles who resembled the void.

Chapter 16



Verse 1

"And Sarah 2 in the tradition, Sarah the wife of Abraham, and Sarah in the tribe of Issachar with Deborah. This teaches that she was important as a mother.
"And Hagar, in the tradition, was a maidservant from Egypt. And Hagar had two mouths (i.e. was talkative). And Hagar said, 'Peace be upon me.' And Hagar had four wings on her back (i.e. she was like a winged creature). This was seen by Daniel. And this is what was expounded: She went and became lost (i.e. strayed from the path of righteousness) and then returned to the idols of her father's household. This is what is meant by her having two mouths, one to thank God and the other to thank idols. But once she repented, she returned and accepted [her role] as they said, 'Keturah is Hagar.' And this is what is meant by 'And Hagar said, "Peace be upon me."' And Hagar had four wings in the days of the kingdom of Ishmael as well."

Verse 2



Verse 3

The word "לִשְׁבֹּת" (to dwell) appears here. The other interpretation is "who turned to dwell in a barren place." If a man marries a woman and lives with her for ten years without her giving birth, he should marry another woman, and the waiting period [for the first wife] does not count towards the total, as it is written, "to dwell with Abram in the land of Canaan." This means that [Hagar] resided in the land of Canaan

Verse 4

"She conceived ב''פ" (in the second month) in the portion. From here, there is a hint to Rashi's commentary that the evil eye affected her and caused her to miscarry, and then she became pregnant again."

Verse 5

"חמסי" [which means "my wrong"] in the manuscript here. "חמסי" [also means "violence upon me"] and "שארי" ["my complaint"] are both under the same category. "You who dwell in Zion" [Isaiah 10:32] also uses the word "כבל" ["rope"], [which is a homonym for "complaint"], in reference to Zion. Sarah is likened to Zion, as it is said of Sarah, "for Sarah was barren" [Genesis 11:30], and of Zion it is said, "Sing, O barren one" [Isaiah 54:1]. Just as Sarah brought trouble [on herself], so too Israel, the Gentiles, bring their troubles upon themselves.

Verse 6



Verse 7

"Upon the well of water" - In the Tanakh, it is said: "And he said, 'Hagar, Sarah's maid, from where did you come, and where are you going?' And she said, 'I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarah.'" (Gen. 16:8) Here and there, behold, I am standing over the well of water. It is good to pray over the water, as it is written, "the voice of splendor is in the waters" (Psalm 29:3), meaning that there the righteous give charity in the name of God. Similarly, prayer is compared to water, as it is written, "Pour out your heart like water before the presence of God" (Lamentations 2:19).

Verse 8

"ברחת" there is 2 places in Tanakh that refers to "in flight." And the other interpretation is "from the sound of the horseman and the archer fleeing the entire city." Because Sarah caused Ishmael to flee, therefore the Israelites fled from him. "The sound of the horseman and the archer" refers to Ishmael, as it is written about him "he was a bowman." (Gen 21:20)

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

"And you shall call" 4 places In the Tanakh it said, "And you shall call," and elsewhere it says, "And you shall call evil upon you" (Jeremiah 2:19). "And you shall call His name Immanuel" (Isaiah 7:14). "And you shall call for salvation on your walls" (Isaiah 62:6). Through Ishmael's name, "And you shall call evil upon you," but through the calling of Immanuel, "you shall call for salvation."

"הפר" in two senses in the text. On one hand, it means "break," and on the other hand, it means "violate his commandment." The Midrash explains it as drawing a comparison between the breaking of the foreskin during circumcision to the breaking of an animal's neck. Just as the neck is broken during the sacrifice of an animal, so too does one violate the commandment of circumcision by not circumcising.

Verse 21

"I will establish my covenant with Isaac" - "אקים" can be interpreted as a hint that God sanctified His beloved friend (Isaac) from the womb.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

"And He appeared to him" - The word "And He appeared" indicates that God revealed Himself to Abraham for the purpose of the word "DA" (which means "knowledge" in Hebrew), which is spelled out by the first letters of the words "Nimlo Atto" (meaning "circumcised with him"). And the word "Samuch" (meaning "near") teaches that God appeared to him because he was sitting at the entrance of his tent on a hot day. This is why our sages said that Abraham was sitting at the entrance of hell and did not allow anyone who was circumcised to enter, except for those who converted to Judaism and were circumcised because their foreskin was pulled back and they were recognized as having been properly circumcised.
The phrase "'וירא אליו ה" with the letter 'ה in the middle (a notation indicating that this is how it appears in a Torah scroll) teaches that the Divine Presence ('ה) came to dwell in the tent of Abraham.
"And He appeared to him" with the letters' numerical value (gematria), this implies that the word appeared (זה) was revealed to him with great honor.
"And the Lord appeared to him in the oaks of Mamre" - The gematria of "in the oaks of Mamre" is that He came to visit the sick.
The phrase "יושב פתח האהל" (sitting at the entrance of the tent) has the numerical value of "to welcome guests."
The word "כחם" in the Scripture means "like the heat of the day," like the heat of the sun, or like the clear, bright light. "And they came like the heat of the day to the house of the man of shame" (Jeremiah 15:8). Here, "like the heat of the day" means not the scorching heat of the sun, but rather the bright and clear light of the Garden of Eden, as it is written, "And the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light" (Isaiah 60:19). However, "the man of shame" means someone who came through conversion for ulterior motives, for there is no greater shame than one who comes through conversion. "Like the heat of the sun" refers to someone who will go to Gehenna, as it is written, "Behold, the day cometh, it burns like a furnace" (Malachi 3:19). "כחם היום" (like the heat of the day) in gematria is equivalent to "זהו בגיהנם" (this is in Gehenna), and in gematria it is equivalent to the word "דם" (blood).

Verse 2

"והנה שלשה" [And here are three] in gematria refers to Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael.

Verse 3



Verse 4

"Let a little water be brought" - here it says "three" [men], and elsewhere [in the same verse] it says, "and let a morsel of bread be eaten." The explanation is that one of the three is a captive, and a sword of destruction is taken from him. The righteous captive is taken from among the wicked, in the merit of the words "Please take a little water." "Iron from the dust is taken" - this means that the sword of destruction is taken from Israel, who are compared to dust, in the merit of Abraham, who said, "I am but dust and ashes." "Please take a little water" has the same numerical value as "from here they merited the well."
"And bathe your feet" - here it says "two," and elsewhere [in the same verse] it speaks of Lot. This teaches that Lot was afraid of robbers, so he preferred to spend the night in the city rather than outside. Abraham, on the other hand, chose to bathe first, indicating that he was not afraid of robbers and would welcome any traveler into his home.

Verse 5

"And I will fetch a morsel of bread" - It would have been sufficient for him to say, "Take a morsel of bread." From here we learn that the host should be proactive.
Your hearts [לבכם] - three [words] in the Tanakh here and there [in the text]. [It means] "set your heart to worry." "וראיתם ושש לבכם" - "and you shall see, and your heart will be glad." This is [to teach us] that [Abraham] was pained that guests had not come to him, and this is [why it says] "set your heart to worry," that he was worried in his heart when he saw them, and "your heart will be glad," as his heart was gladdened [when they arrived].

Verse 6



Verse 7

"and to the cattle" - The letter "ק" (Kuf) is written small to indicate that there were only three animals. In the merit of this, he was granted a son at the age of one hundred.
"And he ran to the cattle" - The letters of "El HaKever" (to the burial place) are rearranged to form the word "Ratz" (he ran). He ran after them to the cave. "And he ran to the cattle" - The gematria (numerical value) of "Ratz LaMearah" (he ran to the cave) is equal to the gematria of "El HaBakar" (to the cattle).

Verse 8

 "And they ate" and later they said to him (Abraham), this is a hint to what they said that we do not speak about the Messiah during a meal, lest our trachea twist in front of our esophagus (and make us choke).

Verse 9

The phrase "ויאמרו אליו" (vayomeru elav) in Genesis 18:9 has a numerical value (gematria) of 241, which is equal to the phrase "אמרו אליה איו" (amaru eleha ayu), meaning "they said to her, 'Where is he?'"

Verse 10



Verse 11

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

"On the face of Sodom" - the letters "samech, tet" (ס״ת) have the numerical value of "mil" (מיל), indicating that the measurement of a mil (distance) went with them to Sodom. This is to teach us that the angel who accompanied Lot measured a mil's worth of distance with him to escort him out of the city.
"Behold" go with them and the Lord. This teaches that the Shekina accompanies the righteous."

Verse 17



Verse 18

"And Abraham" the letter "Heh" is at the beginning of the verse, "And Abraham and Sarah were old." Abraham will be, meaning even though Abraham and Sarah were old, Abraham will become a great nation. Abraham was old, and he was 99 years old. Abraham was a hundred years old. This means that despite the fact that Abraham and Sarah were old, Abraham would become a great nation.
The phrase "היו" (will be) has a gematria value of 21. The interpretation is that when one is at the age of 21 (בן ק"ן), he will become a great nation. This aligns with the idea expressed in the verse "סי כן יבורך גבר" (The one who diligently seeks good will be blessed).

Verse 19

"Who will command his children" – The numerical value(612) of the letters of "אשר יצוה" (who will command) is equal to the numerical value of the word "תורה" (Torah), and in the numerical value of "ברית" (covenant).

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

"And I am dust and ashes. From here, [Abraham] merited the ashes of the Red Heifer and the dust of the Sotah (a woman suspected of adultery). 'Dust' in gematria (numerical value) is equal to 'Sotah' with a left Shin (ש), and 'Ashes' in gematria is equal to 'Parah' (Heifer). Dust and ashes. In one context here [Genesis], and in another in the Book of Job. And I will be comforted over dust and ashes. This is greater than what is said in Job than what is said about Abraham."

Verse 3

"And unleavened bread, in one context [Exodus] it is stated as 'matzah,' and in another [Leviticus] as 'matzot.' This teaches that the Passover offering was distinguished in its matzah here [Exodus] from the matzot there [Leviticus]."

Verse 4

"They shall lie down three in a bed before they lie down. The uncircumcised shall lie down [Ezekiel 32:22]. Together on the dust they shall lie down [Job 10:9]. The explanation: 'The uncircumcised shall lie down' refers to the Gentiles, who are like the people of Sodom. Because concerning Sodomites and similar [sinful nations], the same verse is said:"
"From the end [of the bed] in one context [Ezekiel 4:4], the entire people [are included] from the end. 'For the city has been captured from the end' [Ezekiel 4:2]. Regarding Nebuchadnezzar, let me tell you that these are appropriate for one destruction like these. Furthermore, when they departed from here, their city was also captured from the end."

Verse 13



Verse 14

"Arise, go out from this place" in one context here, and in another, "Arise, go out from the midst of my people." This teaches that the Israelites were divided into groups, with some unwilling to leave, and they died during the three days of darkness."

"As the practice in one place is the practice throughout the entire land. As the practice during the day is so [is it] here.

Verse 2

The small "kaf" signifies that Abraham cried, but not too much because she was elderly, and also because she caused her own death when she passed judgment for her own deeds onto another (cf. TB Rosh Hashanah 16b) and therefore was punished first, and one does not eulogize someone who dies by suicide.

<b>In the end of days.</b> See Rashi. When the Divine Presence departed he was concerned that his sons were tainted with sin, but they pointed out that the root letters of the word <i>cheit</i> — “sin” — do not even appear in their names. He replied that neither do the letters comprising <i>keitz</i> — “the end [of days]”.
