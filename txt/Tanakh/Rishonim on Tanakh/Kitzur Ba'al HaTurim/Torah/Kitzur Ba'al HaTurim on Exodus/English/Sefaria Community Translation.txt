"And you shall eat the meat": The verse begins with eating and concludes with eating "with bitter herbs you should eat it", hinting that eating is necessary twice; eating the Pascal lamb and the eating of the Chagiga offering. 
2: "You shall eat it": And it is juxtaposed to "Do not eat" to say that you shall eat it specifically for the sake of Pesach and not for the sake of unrefined eating.
3: "You shall eat it": There  are four of this word in the mesora tradition, and two of them are concerning the topic of Pesach. 
Elsewhere it is written, "Aharon and his sons shall eat it", concerning [the ordination of the Kohanim].
Just like there they were commanded "And you shall not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting", so too here, "And you, no man should go out of the entrance of his house".
And elsewhere, "But those who harvested shall eat it" - that it connects the final redemption with the initial redemption.

They trusted in haShem -  "the men of Nineveh trusted in haShem" [Yonah 3:5]. As is stated in the midrash [Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer 43]: "not one of them remained" [Exodus 14:28] - none remained except one, and that was Par'oh, and he walked to Nineveh and ruled there. And this is "the men of Nineveh trusted in haShem": he was reminded of what he had seen in Mitzrayim and at the sea.

Honoring one's parents is next to [the commandment to observe] Shabbat to tell you that just as one is obligated to respect Shabbat one is obligated to honor one's parents.
