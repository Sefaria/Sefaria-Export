Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Exodus



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>A man went.</b> This appears twice in Scripture, here, and the second time (<i>Ruth</i> 1:1): “Now it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land, and <b>a man went</b> from Bethlehem of Judah to sojourn in the fields of Moav.” As a result of “a man went,” the first redeemer (Moshe) was born, and by means of the latter “a man went,” the last redeemer, who is the Mashiach, the son of David, will come.

Verse 6

<b>And behold! A youth was crying.</b> This refers to Aharon, for his mother placed him near the wicker basket (<i>Yalkut Shimoni, Parshas Shmos</i>, 166). “A youth was crying” in <i>gematria</i> is equivalent to “this is Aharon HaKohen”.

<b>Exactly who will be going.</b> Pharaoh said to Moshe, “Do you think you are going to enter the Holy Land? In fact, you are all destined to die in the desert with the exception of Yehoshua and Caleiv!” Thus the numerical value of <i>mi vemi haholchim</i> (“Exactly who will be going”) is equal to that of <i>Caleiv ve[Yehoshua] Bin Nun</i>. Moshe responded, “With our young and with our old we will go!” because the decree that they would die in the desert did not apply to those below the age of twenty nor above the age of sixty.

<b>Moshe drew near.</b> <i>Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer</i> notes that the word <i>nigash</i> (“drew near”) is actually in the passive voice (“he was drawn near”). The <i>Midrash</i> explains that the angels Michael and Gavriel grabbed Moshe by his two hands and brought him before the <i>Shechinah</i> against his will. 
<b>To the dense cloud (<i>ha’arafel</i>).</b> The numerical value of <i>arafel</i> (385) is equal to that of the word <i>Shechinah</i>.

Verse 20

<b>You shall command the B’nei Yisrael.</b> This is the only <i>parshah</i> in the Torah since Moshe first appears in which he is not mentioned (outside of the book of <i>Devarim</i> in which he is the narrator). This is in fulfillment of the curse that he proclaimed against himself, “[And if not,] blot me out from Your book” (Shemos 32:32). Although this curse was conditional upon God’s refusal to forgive the people for the sin of the Calf, the curse of a scholar is fulfilled in some way, even when made conditionally. The expression “command” is used in connection with both the oil and the daily sacrifice (Bamidbar 28:2) because both entail a daily expense and therefore need reinforcement.
