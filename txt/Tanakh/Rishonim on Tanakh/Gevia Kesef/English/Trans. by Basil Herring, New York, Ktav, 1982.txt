Gevia Kesef

Preface

<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">*Parenthetical insertions in the body of the translated text have been inserted by the translator to facilitate a clearer understanding of Kaspi’s text. Scriptural verses are translated in accordance with the 1917 JPS translation. Hence the tetragrammaton is rendered as “Lord”; <i>’Elokim</i> as “God.” <b>Annotation </b><br>In the notes that follow, references to the chapters in Part I of this book are given in arabic numbers (e.g., Chapter 1) and references to chapters of the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> are given in roman numbers (e.g., chap. I).</i>Joseph Ibn Kaspi said: After giving thanks to God, who bestowed wisdom on our teacher Moses, the light of God and the light of Israel, in whose light we see light,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. These terms refer to Moses Maimonides, not Moses the lawgiver, for these honorifics are used by Kaspi elsewhere to describe Maimonides. See, for example, “our teacher Moses” (MK II 294; AS I 68); Maimonides as the source of illumination is mentioned on AK I 46, 51, 111.</i> I will begin by saying that the intention of this work is to write whatever I can regarding the secrets of the Torah that I did not see fit to write in the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef, Ṭirat Kesef, Mizraḳ Kesef</i>, and <i>Menorat Kesef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. In the chapter introducing the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, the relation of these works to the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> has been discussed.</i> I have called this book <i>Yoreh De‘ah</i> (“The Guide to Knowledge”),<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. In all the references to the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> in Kaspi’s writings, this name is not found. One reason for mentioning this name in this context might be the desire to indicate the importance of this work as a source of knowledge. In the Munich MS of the <i>Ḳevuṣat Kesef</i>, another name, <i>’Oṣar ’Adonai</i>, is mentioned.</i> similar to the name <i>Moreh Ha-Torah</i> (“The Guide to the Torah”), for that is its meaning. Its agnomen reflecting my own name is <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> (“The Silver Goblet”), “it is that in which my lord drinketh.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Gen. 44:2, 5.</i> We can begin with what is intended, with the help of the Lord.





Chapter 1

In addition to what has been written in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> and <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i>, (one should) know that it is correct to say of God that He is the first cause, in a sense that is compound as well as the (simple) sense of His essence.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Below in n. 14 the sense in which God is “compound” is explained.</i> This is certainly true of the world of Separate Intelligences of which the Lord, may He be blessed, is part.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Kaspi here refers to the existence of universe as three successive worlds, as postulated by the Aristotelian school: the world of Separate Intelligences; the world of Heavenly Spheres below that; the sublunar world of elements. This hierarchy, accepted by Ibn Ezra and Maimonides, is explained by Kaspi in detail in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 79 ff.). In the present passage God is described as being the highest part of the world of Separate Intelligences, and therefore “part” of the universe. Cf. above p. 28, n. 188.</i> The reason is that the world of Separate Intelligences, or if you will, the universe of the Intellect, or the universe of the Intelligences, consists of Him, blessed be He, His court and His attendants, as our Sages said. This category is divided, according to our conception, into three components, when described in terms of cause and effect,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Each Intelligence is the cause of the one Intelligence below it, and it is in this sense only that they can be numbered separately. This way to distinguish them follows Maimonides, <i>Ma’amar Ha-Yiḥud</i>, ed. M. Steinschneider (Berlin, 1846), p. 5.</i> as Abu-Nasr (Al-Farabi) said (when he described them as) “the Primary One, the Secondary Ones, and the Active Intellect.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. Al-Farabi, <i>Al-Madinah Al-Fadilah</i> (Beirut, 1959), p. 23, cited in M. Fakhry, <i>A History of Islamic Philosophy</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1970), pp. 136 ff., refers to God as “the First.” Here “Primary One” refers to God, “Secondary Ones” refers to the Separate Intelligences as a group (<i>shniyim</i>), with the Active Intellect as the lowest of the Intelligences. Together they constitute the uppermost of the three worlds. On Kaspi’s perception of that world, see A. Altmann, “The Ladder of Ascension,” in <i>Studies in Mysticism and Religion Presented to Gershom Scholem</i> (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1967), p. 23.</i> You should know that it was from this that in ancient times there first emerged a belief in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Only later was that belief transformed into something else.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. This is an oblique reference to Christianity. Later in chapter V Kaspi is more explicit. Kaspi’s point here is that the Christian doctrine of the trinity has Jewish roots, a point that is discussed and approved by H. Wolfson, <i>The Philosophy of the Church Fathers</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1964), pp. 141–167, without any reference to Kaspi.</i> Indeed, the Lord, blessed be He, is the Primary One, and is the Father; the Intelligences<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Literally “the Secondary Ones.”</i> are known as son or sons, as it says “sons of God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Gen. 6:2.</i> “sons of might,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Ps. 29:1.</i> which is the main meaning of those verses. Certainly God is called “Father” throughout the Torah and the Bible, for He is the primary bestower of life for all. The Active Intellect is referred to as “the Spirit of God,” “the Holy Spirit,” or “the Spirit of the Lord.” All this is evident.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. For further discussion of the structure of the uppermost world, see M. Friedlander, <i>Essays on the Writings of Abraham Ibn Ezra</i> (London, 1877), p. 13.</i>
Accordingly, the world of Separate Intelligences is in one respect one, and in another respect many. If you will you may say (the Separate Intelligences) are many and they are one. Alternatively, | the world of Separate Intelligences as a whole is three, and is one. It was in this manner that the convention of the trinity arose. Even the Primary One (God) Himself could be described in this manner, being one unto Himself and also the threefold cause of the Intelligences and the Active Intellect.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. In the <i>‘Ammudei Kesef</i> (AM 70), Kaspi attributes this idea that God is the threefold cause of the universe to Al-Batalyawsi’s <i>Book of Intellectual Circles</i>. Such an idea is found in that work, in D. Kaufmann, ed., <i>Die Spuren Al-Batlajusis in der Jüdischen Religionsphilosophie</i> (Berlin, 1880), pp. 37 ff. (according to the pagination at the back). In <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 83) Kaspi himself explains that God is perceived in a threefold manner, in that not only is He the intellect and the intellectually cognizing subject as well as the intellectually cognized object (cf. <i>Guide</i> I:68), but He is also the efficient, formal and final cause of the universe (see <i>Guide</i> I:69).</i> Accordingly it could also be said of Him that He is one and He is three, even while He is absolutely one, while everything else is many, for they are compounded of and perfected by cause and effect, which is not so with God, for He has no cause. This is according to our Torah. For this reason the Men of the Great Assembly said, “They import holiness to you three times,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. This follows the Sephardic version of the <i>kedushah</i> prayer.</i> in referring to the statement of Isaiah, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts …”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Isa. 6:3. Kimḥi, in his commentary to this verse, gives a more conventional reading, finding reference to the three worlds that praise God. The Aramaic Targum Onkelos understands the reference as to the heavens, the earth, and the infinity of time. Kaspi goes beyond them to understand the reference as being to the threefold aspect of God Himself, or that of the world of Separate Intelligences. For other, similar interpretations of this verse, most notably that of Crescas, see H. Wolfson, <i>Crescas’ Critique of Aristotle</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1929), p. 459, n. 92, where Crescas is interpreted as referring to a kabbalistic system of <i>sefirot</i>.</i> where the threefold repetition refers to the world of Separate Intelligences in general, and the Lord in particular.

Chapter 2

In the <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i> I explained the changes that occur (regarding the names of God) in the Account of Creation, where sometimes He is called God, sometimes the Lord God, and sometimes the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i> is not extant. The question of the divine names in the story of Creation was raised in the nonextant <i>Kesef Sigim</i>, as is clear from <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 15). In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 88–91) Kaspi discusses this subject with reference to the opening chapters of Genesis, and considers his discussion there as complementary to that in <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i>. From that discussion it appears that <i>’Elokim</i> was used by Moses in the first chapter of Genesis because it was a term universally recognized as referring to the maker of the universe. Of course the pagans thought the reference to be to the world of Heavenly Spheres, and Moses knew that he could not alter that perception immediately. For this reason the following references were to “tetragrammaton <i>’Elokim</i>,” i.e., the uppermost world of Separate Intelligences. Finally, the tetragrammaton alone occurs, intending the Lord Himself. In this way Moses hoped to bring the world to the recognition of the one true God.</i> I will now complete this with respect to changes occurring in the Torah after the order of Creation, beginning with “These are the generations of Noah. Noah was in his generations a man righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Gen. 6:9.</i> Notice that, similar to Job,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. The <i>Guide</i> III:22 had noted that Job 1:1 describes Job as “wholehearted and upright, feared God and shunned evil” without any reference to Job’s wisdom.</i> it says that Noah was righteous, not that he was wise, for the intent is to refer to the whole narrative including Noah and his generations as far as Abraham. And even though the Lord spoke with him so that he was a prophet (and therefore must have been wise), it is as Maimonides explained—that “prophecy” and “prophet” are equivocal.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. <i>Guide</i> II:35, in reference to Moses’ prophecy as compared to that of other prophets.</i> Thus of Noah it is said, “Noah walked with God,” not “… with the Lord” using the ineffable name. This is like “and Enoch walked with God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Gen. 5:22.</i> which is written of Enoch. The use of the <i>hitpa‘el</i> is known from the study of logic as an action still in progress and incomplete.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. This point is discussed somewhat more by Kaspi in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 302), where the <i>hitpa‘el</i> is described as referring to “an action still in the middle.” There Kaspi refers to the <i>Physics</i> of Aristotle as his source. In the <i>Physics</i>, bk. 3, 201a, Aristotle defines motion as “the fulfillment of what exists potentially, insofar as it exists potentially.” Thus Noah was potentially close to God.</i> It is thus with every usage of the <i>hitpa‘el</i> stem in Hebrew. Reliable evidence for this is “there you shall sell yourselves … for bondmen and bondwomen …,”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Deut. 28:68, <i>“Ve-hitmakartem …”</i></i> which must be in the progressive aspect with the transactions uncompleted. Proof of this is provided by “and no man shall buy you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. At the end of the same verse.</i> Noah’s greatest perception was his recognition of the heavenly influences, similar to his contemporaries, who also did not realize that there was an existent beyond the Heavenly Spheres.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Elsewhere Kaspi says that this knowledge of the uppermost world of Separate Intelligences was first revealed by Abraham.</i> For this reason he attributed most matters, and certainly the flood with the action of the wind that caused the waters to subside, as well as the other details of the story, to the causative action of the Heavenly Spheres, | which are what is intended in the name of “God” (<i>’Elokim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Accordingly, <i>’Elokim</i> is a generic name for the two upper worlds, which are the Separate Intelligences and the Heavenly Spheres, respectively. “The Lord,” as explained earlier, is part of the former.</i> Notice especially that at the outset “God” is mentioned,”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. In v. 1.</i> then there is a change to the name “Lord” when it is written, “And the Lord said unto Noah: come thou and all thy house into the ark.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Gen. 7:1.</i> This was (written) to inform us, the recipients of the Torah, that the Lord was the first cause (of those events), and that when we cling to Him we are protected from any evils caused by the constellations or the signs of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. These latter terms are translated in accordance with the sense of J. Klatzkin, <i>’Oṣar Ha-Munaḥim Ha-Philosophim</i> (Berlin, 1928), vol. II, p. 136. This doctrine of heavenly influences was developed most notably in Ibn Ezra’s theory of providence, as found in his commentary to Exod. 3:15. See D. Rosin, “Die Religionsphilosophie Abraham Ibn Ezras,” <i>MGWJ</i>, vol. XLII, p. 160.</i> Similarly it says, “Thus did Noah according to all that the Lord commanded him.” It was, however, very important that regarding Noah’s sacrifice to God the Torah not mention the name “God” (to whom Noah sacrificed), but only “Lord,” which is the ineffable and unique name, for the error of contemporary nations was that they sacrificed to the heavenly host. In the Torah Moses intended above all to remove that belief from us, and to have us believe in the world of the Separate Intelligences that exist in addition to the Heavenly Spheres. Moses did the same regarding (his description of) of the sacrifices of Cain and Abel.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. Gen. 4:3–4.</i> As for the “dispersed generation,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Gen. 10:35, “for in his days was the earth divided (<i>niflegah ha-’areṣ</i>.)”</i> who believed exclusively in the Heavenly Spheres, it is clearly fitting to refer to Him who intervened with them as “the Lord” in His glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Gen. 11:5.</i>

Chapter 3

When the writer of the Torah began with the stories of Abraham he wrote, “Now the Lord said to Abram: Get thee out …”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. Gen. 12:1.</i> for Abraham was the first one to discover a belief affirming the existence of the world of Separate Intelligences. This opinion caused him to leave his land,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 72) Abraham’s father, Terah, is described as taking the family from Ur on account of the intense hatred that the beliefs of Abraham had engendered in their contemporaries.</i> doing what he did, for which the Lord acted to save him on various occasions.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 85) Abraham is reported to have written many books proving the existence of God beyond the world of Heavenly Spheres. These books were later stolen by the Greeks and Arabs; consequently the proofs of God’s existence as found in Aristotle were initially proposed by Abraham. Cf. above p. 25.</i> Consequently in the stories of Abraham, “Lord” is stated repeatedly, except for those few places where there is good reason.
Firstly, in the vision beginning, “And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto him: I am God Almighty …”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Gen. 17:1.</i> Having begun with “Lord” in accordance with the principle I mentioned—that Abraham possessed this important knowledge—the writer of the Torah continues the rest of the vision without mentioning “Lord” again, for the vision refers to material things appealing to the imagination, such as Abraham’s becoming the patriarch for many peoples through Isaac and Ishmael; and also the command to make the sign in his flesh, and that of his descendants. For this reason “God” is used, for being equivocal, it refers to the Heavenly Spheres as well as the imaginative faculty predominating in every prophet, except Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. <i>Guide</i> II:36.</i> This is certainly the case when those prophets perceive that which is of a material nature and imagined, as has been explained. The Torah is likewise precise in its use of <i>Shaddai</i> (“Almighty”), which, being an adjective similar to <i>davvai</i>, refers to someone victorious (alone) whenever | large numbers of people would (ordinarily) be necessary, as has been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. See below chap. X, n. 3, where this name is discussed.</i> It is the same in the Lord’s words to Jacob, and in those of Isaac to Jacob (when he said), “and God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Gen. 28:3.</i> It is likewise in Jacob’s words to Joseph, (when saying) “God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan and said unto me …”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. Gen. 48:3.</i>
In this verse “walk before me …” in the context of Abraham, the use of the <i>hitpa‘el</i> stem teaches us that the intended meaning of this commandment is to things of a corporeal nature, belonging to the imaginative faculty. Similarly, the occurrence twice of “God” in the story of the smiting of Sodom,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Gen. 19:29.</i> where there was an overflow of fire and brimstone that was similar to (Noah’s) flood with its overflow of water, teaches us that (the Heavenly Spheres) are the proximate and essential cause of everything. Now “Lord” is used most of the time to teach us that the Lord in His glory is the ultimate cause of all the actions and powers of the Heavenly Spheres. In the story of Abraham with Abimelech, when it is related that God spoke to Abimelech, the name “God” (<i>’Elokim</i>) is used,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Gen. 20:6.</i> for he only believed in the Heavenly Spheres, and his (prophetic) faculty was exclusively an expression of the imaginative faculty. It appears that the latter consideration is mentioned even regarding Abraham himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Abraham likewise relied on his imaginative faculty for his prophetic visions, for only Moses’ prophecy excluded the use of that faculty.</i> However, in the recovery of Abimelech it says, “for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Gen. 20:18.</i> in order to prevent our erring and to ensure our belief that the Lord is the primary cause of all. Similarly, later regarding Abraham there is the precise beginning of “And the Lord remembered Sarah …”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. Gen. 21:1.</i> Thus, because of the circumcision (that was to be commanded), it states, “as God had commanded him,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. Gen. 21:4.</i> in a usage of the name that is similar to that mentioned in the earlier vision. We can certainly note the precision of “God (<i>’Elokim</i>) hath made laughter for me,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Gen. 21:6.</i> which does not use “the Lord.” (This usage is correct) for it is not correct to attribute laughter or a similar attribute (to the Lord, but rather)<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. This insertion seems necessary to make sense of the present passage. It is only a tentative suggestion.</i> to the world of Separate Intelligences. There is a similar precision in “And God said unto Abraham, ‘let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman,’ ”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. Gen. 21:12.</i> for such matters of the imagination, including offspring, can only be properly associated with the imaginative faculty,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. In commenting on Prov. 17:6, Kaspi says that while there is a command to be fruitful and multiply, it is not one of the more important ones.</i> which is an equivocal term for the name “God.” This is true of material and imagined matters in general, for the imagination is corporeal or material.
The statement regarding Hagar “And God opened her eyes”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Gen. 21:19.</i> —is surely similar to that which was said of Eve.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Gen. 3:7 records that God opened the eyes of Adam and Eve to see beyond corporeal matters, as explained in the <i>Guide</i> I:2.</i> Regarding what is said of Rebecca—“And the Lord said unto her”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. Gen. 25:23. According to the preceding point, the tetragrammaton would be misplaced here, for the context is of childbirth and other material matters.</i> —there is no problem, for | it is not always and forever necessary to be precise. Sometimes the Torah is exact, and at other times it is inexact, as Maimonides wrote regarding the fifth cause of contradiction as found in the Torah and Prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. Here Kaspi alludes to the <i>Guide</i> : Introduction to the first part, which states that on occasion the Torah does not use the exact terminology, instead leaving such precision to another context in the Torah. This principle of Kaspi’s exegesis is discussed in Chapter 2 above. In MK II 67, however, Kaspi prefers to explain that the tetragrammaton here alludes to the Lord as the most distant mover of all speech.</i> Accordingly, occasionally the Torah will be careful to use “God” on account of His being the immediate cause, while at other times “Lord” appears on account of His being the distant mover of all. Reliable evidence of this usage is “And the Lord said to the children of Israel,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Judg. 10:11.</i> (which conveys the truth that) in any case He is the mediate speaker.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. This means that the Lord spoke to them through some intermediate speaker, for it is not conceivable that there was another revelation to the entire nation as there had been at Sinai.</i>
At the binding of Isaac the use of “God” at the outset, in the command to sacrifice his son, was most appropriate, for (that command) was not apposite of the Lord. For this reason, when preventing the act, the Torah states, “the angel of the Lord”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. Gen. 22:11. Kaspi discusses this event and the names used, in greater detail below chap. XIV, pp. 230–231.</i> and not “the angel of God.” This is because such prevention becomes obvious when one perceives the existence of the world of Separate Intelligences, and clings to that world.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. Kaspi means that one who has knowledge of the world of Separate Intelligences knows that such a sacrifice is an abomination.</i> When the Torah refers to Abraham’s act, it is careful to say, “thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thy only son …,”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. Gen. 22:12.</i> for the sacrifice of his son was because he feared God, i.e., the Heavenly Spheres.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. Kaspi means that had Abraham sacrificed Isaac, it would have been consistent with the prevalent mentality, which believed exclusively in <i>’Elokim</i>.</i> Such an act was also the result of the imagination, for such was and still is, the custom of the nations in making offerings and sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. Kaspi’s critical approach to sacrifice is more clearly spelled out in the context of the binding of Isaac below in chap. XIV.</i> Furthermore when interrupted (by the angel, Abraham) said, “ <i>’Adonai yir’eh</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. Gen. 22:14, meaning “the Lord seeth,” using the tetragrammaton.</i> as opposed to the previous “God will provide Himself …” spoken during the preparation.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. Gen. 22:8.</i>
When Laban and Bethuel answered Eliezer, saying, “the thing proceedeth from the Lord,”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. Gen. 24:50.</i> even though they knew only of “God,” (they mentioned “Lord”) because Eliezer the servant of Abraham had attributed everything to the Lord, irr saying, “O Lord, the God of my master Abraham,”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. Gen. 24:42.</i> as with all his statements. Similarly Abimelech said to Isaac, “We saw plainly that the Lord was with thee,”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. Gen. 26:28.</i> i.e., “the Lord who is your God in some way gives you strength and success.”
Regarding Isaac, first it is written, “God blessed Isaac his son,”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. Gen. 25:11.</i> for (at that young age) he had not yet experienced divine (revelation). Yet from that point on, only “Lord” is mentioned in his context. It is the same regarding Rebecca, his wife.
In the stories of Jacob, however, the Torah always uses “Lord,” for he was more complete than was Isaac. Thus, unlike Isaac, who had not been as | complete as Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. Kaspi says that in the following verses, which refer to Isaac, the memory and merits of Abraham are invoked in order to increase the well-being of Isaac. This indicates that Abraham was the greater of the two.</i> it is not said of Jacob, “because that Abraham hearkened to my voice,”<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. Gen. 26:5.</i> or “for my servant Abraham’s sake.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. Gen. 26:24.</i> The exception (where “God” appears in the stories of Jacob) is “the house of God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. Gen. 28:17.</i> and that is on account of its being followed by “and this is the gate of heaven.” Jacob said that because he recognized that the place was conducive to prophecy and perception because of the celestial cause that predominated there, as Ibn Ezra noted.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">40. Ibn Ezra says on this verse: “This is the house of God—in which a person can pray in time of need, for his prayer will be heard on account of its being a special place.”</i> He continued to say, “If God will be with me …”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">41. Gen. 28:20.</i> (using <i>’Elokim</i>) in accordance with the opinion of our Torah that the world of Separate Intelligences is the first cause.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">42. As explained above, <i>’Elokim</i> refers to the upper two worlds, which are here referred to by Kaspi as <i>ha-sekhel ha-nifrad</i> (“the separate intellect”), which as an entity influences the events of the sublunar world below them.</i> The proof of this is provided by the opening verse of the Torah, “In the beginning God created …” as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">43. See above chap. II, n. 1.</i> When Jacob’s wives speak, and when Jacob speaks to them, they mention “God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">44. Gen. 31:5, 9, 11, 16.</i> for that is appropriate for them, as we have already mentioned. This is especially the case as they are the daughters of (the pagan) Laban, as is proved by Rachel when she coveted the teraphim.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">45. Gen. 31:19.</i> When on occasion they do mention “Lord,”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">46. Gen. 29:32–33, 30:24.</i> it is only because they learnt this from Jacob. Notice the precision regarding Laban when the Torah says, “and God came to Laban,”<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">47. Gen. 31:24.</i> similar to what was written of Abimelech,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">48. Gen. 20:3.</i> in accordance with his confused belief in the power of the Heavenly Sphere and that of the imagination. Laban said to Jacob, “the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight saying …,”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">49. Gen. 31:29.</i> for how could the god of Laban assist Jacob when (Jacob) did not believe in him. Similarly he said, “the Lord watch between me and thee,”<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">50. Gen. 31:49.</i> in accordance with Jacob’s belief. Furthermore Laban made Jacob swear by the Lord, for Jacob feared Him, and not God. In summarizing in conclusion, Laban said, “The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor … judge betwixt us …”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">51. Gen. 31:53.</i> whereas “Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">52.

He means that they take place in a prophetic vision, which with the exception of Moses, necessarily involves the imaginative faculty.</i> It is similar with “And God said unto Jacob,”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">58. Gen. 35:1.</i> | and “there God was revealed unto him,”<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">59.

Certainly (this usage of “God”) is true of Joseph,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">62. Gen. 39:9, 40:8, 41:16.</i> for his prophetic faculty utilized dreams, especially when the composite image concerned corporeal and imaginative matters. This completes the Book of Genesis.
It is well known that the primary concern of Exodus is with Moses, starting, “And Moses was keeping the flock …”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">63. Exod. 3:1.</i> Notice the care in ordering that episode, for initially it states “the mountain of God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">64. Ibid.</i> for that mountain was where He always appeared. Later, at the onset of Moses’ vision he perceived an angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">65. Exod. 3:2.</i> Later yet, having gone higher, it is written, “When the Lord saw.”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">66. Exod. 3:4.</i> Nonetheless when saying “Draw not nigh hither,”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">67. Ibid.</i> the words are attributed not to the Lord but to God, for it is only later, after “put off thy shoes,” that we find “and the Lord said …”<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">68. Exod. 3:7.</i> Again later, having already perceived (the Lord), Moses’ perception was weakened at the hiding (of the Lord), and he shrank back at the prospect of accepting the Lord’s charge. Consequently it says, “And Moses said unto God, ‘who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh.’ ”<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">69. Exod. 3:11.</i> This resulted from the weakness of the imaginative faculty, which Moses at that moment perceived as not having been completely purified.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">70. Kaspi explains elsewhere that Moses went through a developmental period, wherein he invoked the wrath of God. The present episode serves to illustrate the earlier stage. See AM 46 ff.</i> Similarly, when it is later mentioned that His name was hidden from Moses, it states, “And Moses said unto God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">71. Exod. 3:13.</i> Furthermore, Moses did not know that “God” is equivocal, proof being that when the Lord answered him, He did not inform Moses that His name was “I am that I am” as well as “the Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">72. In these verses it was necessary for Him to omit the tetragrammaton, for at that point Moses was not aware of that name. Consequently only <i>’Elokim</i> is used.</i> For this reason (of Moses’ ignorance) it was correct to write, “And God said … unto Moses.”
From that point and on, however, (only) “Lord” is used. It is only as explained regarding “And God said unto Moses” that we can understand “I am the Lord”<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">73. Exod. 6:3; i.e., it was necessary for Him to affirm the tetragrammaton because there might still have been lingering doubts in Moses’ mind.</i> as making the expression more acceptable. Subsequently, the Torah consistently uses “Lord” up to “Now Jethro heard.”<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">74. Exod. 18:1.</i> | In the context of Jethro, “God” is used, for he was a gentile.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">75. Ibid., but in vv. 9–10 the tetragrammaton is used.</i> (“God”) is likewise mentioned by Moses in reference to the masses and their statutes, in saying, “I make them know the statutes of God and His laws,”<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">76. Exod. 18:6.</i> and not “the statutes of the Lord.” At the gathering (of the people at Mount Sinai) Moses was careful (to write “God”), for he did not want to associate his ascent with “the Lord,” only with “God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">77. Exod. 19:3.</i> Similarly it says, “And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">78. Exod. 19:17.</i> when they approached the Heavenly Sphere together, in a physical sense,—something which cannot be true of the Lord, who has no place. Yet it does say there, “And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai,”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">79. Exod. 19:20.</i> (and not “God”) for it was there that the influence of the world of Separate Intelligences was in effect over Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">80. The tetragrammaton here is equivocal, referring to the world of Separate Intelligences as a whole.</i> Regarding the Ten Commandments the Torah is even more precise when it says, “And God spoke all these words saying.”<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">81. Exod. 20:1, at the outset of the Ten Commandments.</i> The reason is that while we find “And the Lord spoke” in several places in reference to Moses, in this case it is known that God spoke with all Israel. Therefore “And the Lord said”<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">82. Exod. 20:19.</i> is an accurate allusion to the world of Separate Intelligences. Nonetheless the speaker was God (the Lord<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">83. It would appear that this is an error in the MS, which should read as referring to the tetragrammaton.</i>), as is evident from the portion <i>Va’etḥanan</i> in the verse, “The Lord spoke with you face to face … I stood between the Lord and you …”<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">84. Deut. 5:4–5.</i> Notice how careful these words are in informing us of the true identity of that speaker and in attributing those words to the Lord in His glory, for it was He who was after all the distant speaker. In addition Moses says of himself “but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God (not “the Lord”) was,”<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">85. Exod. 20:18.</i> for such is the style in Hebrew.
From that point and on, throughout the Book of Exodus, as well as the Book of Leviticus, only “the Lord” is written.
In the Book of Numbers, however, it is written, “and the people spoke against their God against Moses,”<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">86. Num. 21:5.</i> it being impossible to relate their action to a Lord that they did not know, or know of. Evidence of this is provided by the fact that even at Mount Sinai, where Moses wanted foremost to have them believe in the Lord, they said at the end, “but let not God speak with us”<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">87. Exod. 20:16.</i> instead of “the Lord.”
In the story of Balaam it is written initially, “And God came unto Balaam and said,”<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">88. Num. 22:9.</i> for that is what he believed.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">89. He means that Balaam did not believe in the world of Separate Intelligences.</i> In addition his prophetic faculty was by virtue of his imagination, even though Balaam and Balak mentioned the name “Lord” several times<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">90. Num. 23:3, 8, 27; 24:11.</i> — | that was only because He is the God of Israel. Every nation, besides knowing the names of its gods, knows also the names of the gods of other nations, such as “Nergal,”<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">91. II Kings 17:30, “And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima …” referring to the gods made by the nations.</i> “Ashima,”<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">92. Ibid.</i> and the others. This is like our comments regarding the words of Abimelech and Laban in speaking with the patriarchs.
In the Book of Deuteronomy only “Lord” is used. Most precise of all is the statement made of the Lord, “And He made them move to and fro in the desert forty years.”<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">93. Num. 32:13, lit. “he caused them to move.”</i> After all, it is well known that Moses our teacher was a more immediate cause of their movement than any external factor, while the Lord was the distant cause. One can conclude that throughout the Torah and Scripture there are several intermediary causes, whether the most distant or more immediate,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">94. In <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 86), Kaspi quotes other examples of such terminology, such as “So Solomon built the house” (I Kings 6:14); “And the Lord said … I will write upon the tablets …” (Exod. 34:1).</i> while there is nothing at all equivocal in the name “Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">95. This means that there is no implication that the Lord Himself carried out His will—He only initiated it.</i> The name (“Lord”) retains its original meaning always, even though all things are attributed to it, for it is the cause and (first) mover of everything, from a distance. Maimonides explained this in the final chapter of Part II (of the <i>Guide</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">96. <i>Guide</i> II:48.</i>

Chapter 4

In my opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. The subject of the names of God is analyzed above in Chapter 3. In AK I 124 Kaspi refers the reader to the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> in order to understand the subject of the names of God, saying that “whoever possesses the <i>Gevia‘</i> will understand perhaps one-tenth [of that subject].”</i> there are three names exclusively applied to the Lord. This means that they are primary, and not derivative, appellations. Even though some of them are on the pattern used for derivative names, they (themselves) are not derivative. These are the tetragrammaton, i.e., <i>yod he’ vav he’</i> ; the name <i>yod he’</i>, which is one-half of the former; as well as <i>’Ehyeh</i>. This is in accordance with what I have written of this in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 94–95) Kaspi says that God has three names distinguishing Him from every other existent. These three, as mentioned here as well, are mentioned in <i>Guide</i> 1:61–63. What follows in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> expands considerably upon the discussion in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i>.</i> In brief I will say here that each of these three names is the special name of the Prime Cause, and that not one of these (names) can be associated with the world of Separate Intelligences, and certainly not with what is below them. Even though they are all primary names, what is unique and special about each of them is the following.
The tetragrammaton is unique and special in that, even though it has some meaning and interpretation according to its letters,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. The letters of the tetragrammaton are those used to indicate existence.</i> if (it) is like <i>yigleh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Lit. “uncover.”</i> and <i>yirbeh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Lit. “multiply”; i.e., the tetragrammaton is, like these, a final weak verb in the imperfect.</i> it is different and distinct from every name because of the prohibition of reading it (according to its letters). Thus, because it has an interpretation (<i>perush</i>) as well as a distinctness (<i>hefresh</i>), it is known for both reasons as the <i>shem ha-meforash</i>, for the root <i>parash</i> has both these meanings, which are really one.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> I:61) explains the name as follows: “This name gives a clear, unequivocal indication of His essence,” unlike all the other names of God, which are equivocal and signify actions, the like of which exist as our own actions. This is reflected in Kaspi’s first explanation that <i>perush</i> means “explanation.”</i> This is the precise and special nature of this name—that with respect to its letters it has a meaning, but that with respect to its reading it has no meaning, except in the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. The priestly blessing invoked this name, cf. <i>Num. Rabbah</i> 11:21. It was also invoked on the Day of Atonement ten times by the high priest. See BT <i>Yoma</i> 39b.</i> And in the Temple, when it is pronounced, it has no independent meaning, | but only (a meaning) by way of allusion that cannot be measured (with precision). The name can be read in one of two ways, or in both of them together, one after the other, according to how the Men of the Great Assembly pointed it in the Bible. One was with a <i>shva’</i> under the <i>yod</i> and a <i>ḳameṣ</i> under the <i>vav</i>, with a <i>naḥ</i> under the two <i>he’</i> letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. This pointing is found in the vast majority of cases, occurring wherever the tetragrammaton appears alone, or when followed by <i>’Elokim</i>.</i> The other was with a <i>shva’</i> under the <i>yod</i>, a <i>ḥolem</i> under the first <i>he’</i>, and a <i>ḥireḳ</i> under the <i>vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. For this usage see Gen. 15:2, 8 and Deut. 3:24, 9:26. It is also found frequently in Amos and Ezekiel.</i> There is no name in Hebrew with a construction similar to this. The latter formulation was only made by the Men of the Great Assembly when it was preceded<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. There are five instances of this: Hab. 3:19; Ps. 109:21, 140:8, 141:8, 68:21.</i> by <i>’Adonai</i>, spelled with an <i>’alef-dalet</i>, as occurred at the vision of the covenant regarding Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Gen. 15:2, 8.</i> and in <i>Va’etḥanan</i> with Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Deut. 3:24.</i> This strange pointing of the ineffable name was necessary, for (in its usual pointing) it is read by people as the spelling <i>’alef-dalet</i>, and how could they read <i>’Adonai ’Adonai</i> (as if the same name were written twice). Therefore it is read as if it were written <i>’Adonai ’Elokim</i>. The punctuation of the ineffable name has no meaning, and neither does its pronunciation, yet it does possess meaning according to its letters, for if we were (permitted) to read it at will, its meaning would be “exists” and “causes to exist,” which would (not) be exclusive to Him.
They not only made the ineffable name exclusive to Him, they also made His attributes exclusive, through the use and pronunciation of <i>’Adonai</i>. For it at no time appears with a <i>ḥireḳ</i> under the <i>nun</i> (in which case it would mean “my master”), but only appears with a <i>ḳameṣ</i> so as to indicate an absolute master, as in <i>davvai</i> or <i>Shaddai</i>, (the latter) being derived from <i>shoded</i> (“destruction”).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. Here Kaspi follows Ibn Ezra rather than Maimonides, who had explained <i>Shaddai</i> as coming from <i>she-dai</i> in <i>Guide</i> I:63. In the present context Kaspi addúces the form <i>Shaddai</i> and emphasizes that it comes from the <i>shoded</i> in order to demonstrate the existence of the nonpronominal suffix <i>ai</i>. This claim, however, is offset by the second parallel mentioned here— <i>davvai</i> —which implies that the root is indeed <i>shaddai</i>. The subject is discussed below in chap. X, n. 3, and in Chapter 3 above.</i> Proof (for the latter) is the verse “As destruction (<i>kāshud</i>) from the Almighty (<i>mi-Shaddai</i>) shall it come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. Isa. 13:6; Joel 1:5.</i> Even though this form can be found in the Hebrew usage in that <i>’Adonai</i> could mean “my lords,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Kimḥi, <i>Mikhlol</i>, ed. I. Rittenberg (Jerusalem, 1966), p. 12a, suggests that <i>’adonai</i> (with <i>pataḥ</i>) can mean “my lords,” by way of an honorific form of address.</i> as has been claimed in this matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. In the <i>Guide</i> I:61 there is the following passage: “all other names give their names in an equivocal way … even [<i>’Adonai</i>] is derived from a term signifying lordship … for these words are emphatic and of a general character applicable also to other beings.”</i> the intent of the Men of the Great Assembly is that it be understood without the adjective “my,” but alone, as in <i>’adon</i> (“master”) or <i>Shaddai</i> (“Almighty”), That is why Maimonides was careful to compare (<i>’Adonai</i>) to “Sarai,” the wife of Abram, saying in the <i>Guide</i> I:61 that such endings “are emphatic and of a general character,” for every specific reference to “my” or “ours” gives a particular (connotation excluding other referents). (Nowhere in relation to God) does the Bible state <i>’adoni</i> with a <i>ḥireḳ</i> under the <i>nun</i>, even when David and the prophets exclaimed, “the Lord (<i>’Adonai</i>), the Lord (tetragrammaton) of hosts.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. Isa. 3:15.</i> Notice how the writer of the Torah was careful to convey the equivocal meaning of <i>’Adonai</i> when it has the <i>ḳameṣ</i> under the <i>nun</i>, for it can be understood either as “Lord” (<i>’adon</i>) or as “my lord” (<i>’adoni)</i>. Thus when He wanted to mention the wife of Abraham, and to allude to his lordship in general, it says| “thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be,”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Gen. 17:15.</i> i.e., one could err regarding “Sarai” by explaining it as containing “my,” whereas with “Sarah” one cannot err. This is similar to the prophets’ writing <i>ha-’Adon</i> (“the Lord”),<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Here “the Lord” is written as <i>ha-’Adon</i> without the polysemous suffix <i>-ai</i>.</i> as I have explained.
What emerges from all that they wrote is that the tetragrammaton refers exclusively to the Lord, because of its unique character, as I have described it.
It is also evident that <i>yod he’</i> refers exclusively to Him, for being one-half of the ineffable name, it has no meaning at all. Certainly its meaning is not “eternal,” as Maimonides thinks it is,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. In the <i>Guide</i> I:61 the tetragrammaton is said to indicate a necessary existence. In <i>Guide</i> I:63, in explaining “I am that I am,” this is repeated, as well as in the case of the bigrammaton, which “refers to the notion of the eternity of existence.”</i> without diminishing from his glory. (After all) nothing like it is to be found anywhere in the Hebrew language. This name is special in that everyone pronounces it, but no one understands it.
<i>’Ehyeh ’asher ’Ehyeh</i> (“I am that I am”) refers exclusively to the Lord in a different way. It has meaning as written and as pointed. Like the (tetragrammaton) it refers exclusively to Him, and is a hylic name.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. In Heb. <i>shem hiyyulani</i>, meaning “underived.”</i> This is because the qualifying clause (“that I am”) is identical with the subject (“I am”), giving the appearance of a mockery.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. He means that the statement would appear to be a tautology.</i> Yet it is not a mockery, for the repetition alludes to the fact that we cannot perceive Him in any specific manner,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. For further discussion of this see above Chapter 3.</i> which is the meaning of “for man shall not see me and live”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. Exod. 33:20.</i> and “my face shall not be seen.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. Exod. 33:23.</i>
This being the case, what these three names have in common is that each is necessarily a primary name, for every derivative name must be composed of two elements, a predicate relating to a subject, even though it may not say so specifically. Because only the Lord is independent of such duality, whether from above or below, He is unique in having a special primary name, which is not derived. These three names share this (characteristic), each of them with its own special properties, as we have explained.

Chapter 5

Notice how the truth is its own witness and consistent in every respect.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 83) Kaspi explains: “the meaning of this is that one side bears witness to the other side. But why should I quote other philosophers, while omitting the words of the perfect philosophers of our people, who said, ‘Words of truth are self-evident’ [<i>nikkarin divrei ’emet</i>]” (BT Soṭah 9a). Kaspi’s reference to other philosophers is to the long tradition in Islamic philosophy, starting with Al-Kindi and culminating in Averroës. The latter accepted the parity of philosophy and Scripture as two primary and infallible sources of truth. It is his formulation which is quoted in the present passage, as quoted in G. F. Hourani, <i>On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy (Kitab Fasl Al-Maqāl</i>) (London: Luzac, 1961), p. 51: “… demonstrative study does not lead to conclusions conflicting with what Scripture has given us; for truth does not oppose truth, but accords with it and bears witness to it.” This passage is also quoted by Falaquera, <i>Sefer Ha-Ma‘alot</i> (Berlin, 1894), p. 12. For a Hebrew translation, see <i>PAAJR XXV</i> (1956), p. 107.</i> The number three is well established among all nations,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. He means that the number figures prominently in the theology of many religions.</i> one of the reasons being that it is a complete numeral, possessing a beginning and a middle, as stated by Aristotle in <i>De Caelo</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. <i>De Caelo</i> I, 1, 168a: “For as the Pythagoreans say, the world and all that is in it is determined by the number three, since beginning and middle and end give the number of an ‘all,’ and the number they give is the triad.”</i> Consequently our prayers are characterized by the number three.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. This is probably in reference to the comments regarding the <i>ḳedushah</i> prayer in chap. I, above pp. 137–138.</i> Therefore the giver of the Torah, in agreeing with this (universality of the number three), enunciated three (divine) names at the beginning of the Torah, | as above.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Cf. above chap. II, p. 138.</i> These (names) are “God,” “the Lord God,” and “the Lord.” Subsequently, at the auspicious encounter of Moses with the Lord during the second forty-day period (at Mount Sinai), it is written “the Lord the Lord God” (Tetragrammaton tetragrammaton <i>’El</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Exod. 34:6.</i> In the priestly blessing “Lord” appears three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7.

As Kaspi explained earlier, the tetragrammaton really includes two names, i.e., the full four letters, and the first two alone. This makes up the number three in the present context.</i> “’Ehyeh,” (and the bigrammaton). This also accords with our perception of the world of Intelligences in every respect.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. These were explained above in chap. I, pp. 136–137.</i> It is also in accordance with our conception of the first Intelligence, as explained above.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 82–83) he explains the details of this doctrine, where the first intelligence (the <i>mishneh ha-ḳarov</i>) necessarily has two perceptions: of itself and of the Lord. All lower intelligences have three perceptions: of themselves, of the immediately preceding intelligence, and of the Lord.</i> This is not in the sense that the world (of Separate Intelligences) can be divided conceptually into three parts, the Primary One, the Secondary Ones (the Intelligences), and the Active Intellect—but that rather each of the Intelligences, with the exception of the first, has at least three components, in that it consists of its perceptions of the Primary One, as well as of the immediately preceding Intelligence, as well as (its perception) of itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. This is explained in the <i>Guide</i> I:69.</i> Even the Primary One Himself has a threefold aspect in that He is cause of the assorted Intelligences in three ways: as efficient cause, formal cause, and final cause.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Cf. above chap.

The subject is discussed in general in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 80–95) without any reference to these verses or prayers.</i> From my words at the beginning of the work, one can understand the verbal similarity between us and the Christians, in that with regard to the trinity they speak of “Father,” “Son,” and “Spirit,” asserting that they are both three and one, which is similar (to what we say). This is all written in the Torah, (such as) when the Lord is described as a father, most remarkably when it says “(thou didst forget God) that bore thee,”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. Deut. 32:18.</i> for this of necessity means that He has a child. This is especially so in view of the verse “Ye are the children of the Lord your God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Deut. 14:1.</i> Furthermore it is written with regard to the Active Intellect: “the spirit of God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Gen. 1:2.</i> corresponding to “the spirit.” Yet | we are really far-removed from the Christians in opinions despite an external similarity in phrases and in speech, even though some individuals among them are similar to us (in opinions).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. This is but one of several statements that Kaspi makes indicating his concerns regarding Christological claims and Biblical exegesis. Many of the verses mentioned in the present chapter are included among the stock Christian arguments on these issues related to the trinity, and it is likely that their mention here is connected to such Christian claims. In this regard, see above Chapter 2, pp. 69 ff. for its impact on Kaspi’s exegesis, as well as Chapter 3, pp. 95–96 as to the latter years of Kaspi’s literary activity. It should be noted in the present context that while Kaspi appears here to countenance the idea of common approaches to exegesis, as a rule he is scathingly critical of Christological exegesis and polemics. For a list of references to Christianity in Kaspi’s writings, see W. Bacher, “Aus der Bibelexegese Joseph Ibn Kaspis,” <i>MGWJ</i> LVI (1912), pp. 209–217.</i>

Chapter 6

What is written in this work up to this point, as well as what is written in <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i> and <i>Menorat Kesef</i>, has resolved the first sixteen questions that we enumerated in <i>Kesef Sigim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. On the interrelationship of these works and of the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, see above pp. 125–132.</i> Therefore I will now proceed to resolve the others one at a time, by writing my opinion regarding the seventeenth question, which embodies two doubts. Regarding the first,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. The question, it appears, was as follows: Noah was commanded to take seven pairs of every species of pure beast, two pairs of each species of impure beast, and seven pairs of each species of fowl of the air—would not a uniform number of one or two pairs have sufficed to preserve each species, as in the case of the impure beasts? If the purpose was for sacrifice when disembarking (Gen. 8:20), why require seven pairs if only one of each kind was sacrificed?</i> it is clear that even though Noah attempted to bring beasts and fowl into the ark to save some seed from each (species) through growth, before the floodwaters came, nonetheless when the rain began and continued for several days, several of the beasts and fowl came in the door on their own<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Gen. 7:8, “Of clean beasts and beasts that are not clean, and of fowls and everything that creepeth upon the ground, there <i>went</i> in two and two unto Noah into the ark …”</i> for shelter and protection from the pouring rain, for the ark door, which was on the side, remained open for four, five, or ten days, (possibly) more. Certainly after the waters had lifted the ark and raised it above ground level, Noah must have forcibly pushed off certain beasts and fowl, for he needed no more than a (certain) number to preserve the species, while he did not have a lot of food in the ark to support and manage them (all). It is not necessary to take the numbers “seven” or “two” literally, for “two” refers to the minimum necessary to maintain the species, i.e., male and female. The number “seven” connotes “many,” (as many) as Noah saw fit (to take), for the Hebrew language does often refer to a multitude with the number “seven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. For the significance and widespread use of the number seven in antiquity, see J. Lewy and H. Lewy, “The Origin of the Week and the Oldest West-Asiatic Calendar,” <i>HUCA</i> XVII (1942), p. 22. Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> II:29) states: “for the Hebrews denote multiplicity by the number seven.” See below chap. XXI, n. 7.</i> The reason that the Lord commanded Noah to take many pure beasts was because man has great need for nourishment, so Noah and his children could eat them in the ark. Furthermore, because (the pure beasts) would be continuously fit for consumption later on, it was necessary that many of them emerge from the ark. In addition, when Noah emerged it says “he took of them for an offering,” but not from the impure beasts.
Regarding the fowl, many were necessary, both pure and impure. As for the pure, (many were necessary) for the same reason as the many pure beasts,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Many fowl were required for consumption.</i> and as for the impure, many were necessary, for undoubtedly sickness and death prevailed among the fowl in the ark—for being accustomed to fly, they would die when confined in the ark, and only a few survive, as we can see for ourselves | when birds are sent from this country by ship across the sea to the king of Ishmael, as a gift.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Kaspi was familiar with the lore of the sea from his own extensive travels. Another example of this is found below chap. IX, p. 191. On the general use of this principle of exegesis by Kaspi, see above pp. 61–63.</i>
Furthermore, because fowl can fly a long distance to concealed places, many of them flew to and entered the ark, whether with or against Noah’s will. This solves the doubt engendered by the question.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Cf. above n. 2.</i>
Regarding the resolution of the second doubt as mentioned there,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. From what follows, it appears that the doubt was caused by the verse “The Lord smelled the sweet savor, and the Lord said in His heart, ‘I will not again curse the ground …’” (Gen. 8:20–22). Are not sacrifices in general to be avoided, as reason would dictate, and why was the Lord so affected by the particular sacrifice offered by Noah after he descended from the ark?</i> and the others in <i>Kesef Sigim</i> included in the seventeenth question, what I wrote in the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 47) Kaspi advocated the superiority of prayer over sacrifice, and even over the building of sanctuaries. Cf. <i>Guide</i> II:32 for a similar statement.</i> and the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 160).</i> suffices to answer it. Nonetheless, writing with great brevity, I can say here that the giver of the Torah wrote Genesis in a manner similar to Job; i.e., he wrote narratives describing passing matters,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. He means that the truths of theoretical and practical philosphy are not presented in a discursive analytic style, but rather occur in the lives of individuals and nations as described by the use of anecdote.</i> determined to inform us in Genesis of the righteous and their activities in all their details. This is particularly with regard to the patriarchs and their descendants. This (was done) because most people strive to imitate their forefathers. For this reason Moses in the Torah told us to offer sacrifices, even though in truth they are an abomination. This, however, is something that it is not proper for the masses to know, (for sacrifices) are necessary to maintain a community.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. On Kaspi’s attitude to the masses and their understanding of Scripture, see above pp. 12 ff, 118, 130 ff.</i> This is especially (necessary) when the opinion of the masses is that sacrifice is most desired by the Lord. Under no circumstances, however, should (sacrifices be offered) to the Heavenly Spheres, but only to the Lord. The same is true of prayer, for even though it is superior to sacrifice, as Maimonides has hinted,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. <i>Guide</i> III:32, “Sacrifice pertains to the second intention, whereas invocation, prayer, and modes of worship come closer to the first intention …”</i> nonetheless when we make assembly halls, a Temple, or synagogues, these, like sacrifices, are not necessary in truth. In the final analysis, however, we must admit that our religion does permit sacrifice when to the Lord, and therefore Moses was correct in writing for us, by way of anecdote, of what occurred in earlier times, those things that demonstrate truth to us individuals, and coarse knowledge to the masses, teaching them how to act in relation to the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. Kaspi means that the masses, upon reading these stories, will conclude that sacrifice is desirable, while select individuals will detect the truth that sacrifice is not desired by God. On Kaspi’s method of “detecting the truth” in such matters, see above Chapter 2.</i> Thus, for (the benefit of singular) individuals, when Adam was in the garden of Eden and the Lord told him of | all the animals that he took, Scripture does not mention that He told Adam to sacrifice them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Gen. 2:19–20.</i> God did not bring them to him for that purpose, but only to see what Adam would name them—i.e., to observe and examine their nature so as to give them a Hebrew name indicating their nature in some way.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Kaspi explains in many places (eg. MK II 296–297; <i>Shulḥan Kesef</i>, fols. 197 ff.) that Hebrew terms reflect the inner nature of the objects they name. For further discussion of this, see above pp. 52 ff.</i> And that is what he did.
In a later passage, in writing of Adam’s three sons, far be it from (the writer of the Torah) to say that the righteous Seth made a sacrifice, as was said of Cain and Abel, the (foolish) enthusiasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. Gen. 4:3–5. In Hebrew the term is <i>he-ḥasid</i>. Kaspi uses the term pejoratively below on fol. 143a, <i>he-ḥasid shoṭeh</i>.</i> In order to benefit the masses, however, it is written that they (sacrificed) to the Lord, and not to God, as it is written, “He that sacrifices unto God, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Exod. 22:19.</i> Later, regarding Noah, who was as righteous as Abel, Job and his friends, the Torah was careful not to write that the Lord commanded Noah to sacrifice to Him, and not to write that he should take many animals into the ark for the purpose of making a sacrifice. Instead (the purpose was) to maintain the species, and Noah made the sacrifices of his own accord, as did Abel and Job.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Job 42:1–10.</i> In any case, Noah’s sacrifice is described as made “to the Lord,” and also (resulting in) “the Lord smelled the sweet savor,”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Gen. 8:20–21.</i> for that is what the masses should believe. Proof of this is provided by the words “for a sweet savor unto the Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. Lev. 4:31, 17:6; Num. 15:24, 18:17, et al. He means that “a sweet savor unto the Lord” means that those who sacrifice consider it sweet. In addition it is also “unto the Lord.” Here, the Lord smelled what was to Noah a sweet smell.</i> For select individuals, however, the writer of the Torah did not write that the three patriarchs sacrificed to the Lord, but wrote only that they made an altar<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. Gen. 13:4, 26:25, 35:7.</i> and a house<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Gen. 33:17.</i> and a pillar.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. Gen. 28:18.</i> Generally a structure is erected in commemoration, as is written regarding the Gadites and the Reubenites,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. Josh. 22:9–24.</i> and some of the acts of Gideon.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. Judg. 6:24.</i> These (structures) remind us that they are to be preferred over making a sacrifice, and the Torah, by omitting to make any mention of sacrifice (by the patriarchs), teaches us that sacrifice is not desirable. Thus neither the patriarchs nor Moses at the altar known as <i>’Adonai-nissi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. Exod. 17:15.</i> offered (sacrifice). When subsequently Moses began to command Israel to make sacrifices, it was commanded to be performed by the young men among them, as it is written, “the young men of the children of Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. Exod. 24:5, in Heb. <i>na‘arei benei yisra’el</i>.</i> Onkelos translated this as <i>zeṭuṭi benei yisra’el</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. This is not found in our editions of Onkelos, where we have instead <i>buḥrei benei yisra’el</i>. The term <i>zeṭuṭi</i> quoted here is found in both Talmuds. In BT <i>Megillah</i> 9a it is related that the seventy-two sages who translated the Bible at the behest of Ptolemy all substituted the word <i>zeṭuṭi</i> for <i>na‘arei</i>. In JT <i>Ta‘anit</i> 4:2 it is related that three Torahs were discovered (II Chron. 34:15), one of which had substituted <i>zeṭuṭi</i> for <i>na‘arei</i>. Kaspi might have had another version of Onkelos or, more likely, confused Onkelos with the translation mentioned in the Talmud. The Targum Yonatan b. Uziel on Exod. 24:11 has <i>zeṭuṭi</i> in translating <i>’aṣilei</i>. Cf. M. Jastrow, <i>Dictionary</i> (New York, 1967), s.v. <i>za‘ṭuṭi</i>.</i> which connotes “youths” in Hebrew. It is clear, for those who can see, that from the way in which sacrifices are described in the Torah, they were (permitted) only by way of necessity, for the reason mentioned by Maimonides.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. See <i>Guide</i> III:32, of which this entire section is a reflection.</i> This is certainly true of the description in Jeremiah of child-sacrifice to Baal and Molech,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. Jer. 7:31, 19:5.</i> and all the more true of the fact that the writer of the Torah recorded the binding of Isaac, as I wrote in <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 102–103).</i> and <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 62).</i> If the Lord grant me length of days, I will gather all (these ideas) in the present work.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. See below chaps. XIV and XVIII. The phrase “length of days” implies that the work was written at the end of his life. On this point, see above p. 131.</i>
What I wrote (in <i>Kesef Sigim</i>) regarding Noah and his descendants at the time of the division (of that generation)<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. The question implied is: Why was it necessary to record the details of Gen. 10, with its names, families, and places of habitation—of what significance could they be?</i> was occasioned by confusion (in that matter).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. Gen. 10:32–11:9.</i> Just as it is clear what is the benefit gained from the story of the flood in all its details—that, as Maimonides said, by reading the prophetic books we know that God was cognizant of their deeds<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. <i>Guide</i> III:50, saying that the flood and Sodom’s fate were recorded to teach us that “there is a God that judges.”</i> (and therefore brought on the flood)—so too, in truth, the entire story (of the divided generation) teaches the same lesson.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. We learn that God knows the lives of human beings.</i> How can this be disputed—for we see such things constantly.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. He means to say that we see this constantly in Scripture.</i> As for the passing details regarding large numbers and small numbers, and large segments of the earth with small segments—these are but as Maimonides said regarding Job, that whether or not he existed, there are many people like him who do exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">40. <i>Guide</i> III:22.</i> This is also true of the story of the uncovering of Noah, and the actions taken by his sons in that regard.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">41. Gen. 9:20–28.</i> (In this regard) I have already written whatever is necessary (to understand this matter) in <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">42. <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 67): “the choice fruit” of the story of Noah comes at its end, with “cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants,” which establishes that Canaan will be a slave to his brothers and to the nations of the world.</i> and <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">43. <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 37–38).</i> This is likewise true of the narrative of the divided generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">44. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 39–41) Kaspi explains the importance of Gen. 10–11 as alluding to later events in the history of the Israelites, as recorded in the books of the Prophets and later in <i>Josippon</i>.</i> In <i>Miẓrak Kesef</i> I have already informed you of the meaning of “there is no chronological order in Scripture.” (It means that) it is not always necessary that what precedes in order precede in cause, for sometimes it may not be a cause at all, while at other times it might be a cause but only an accidental one (and not an essential one),<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">45. On the importance which Kaspi attaches to this doctrine in his Scriptural exegesis, see above pp. 46 ff, 114 ff.</i> as is the case when lightning strikes and kills an ox or sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">46. This phrase is found in Averroës’ <i>Epitome of Aristotle’s Logic</i> (Riva di Trento, 1559), p. 52a, “when lightning strikes and an animal dies …”</i> There are many instances of this. It was, however, necessary that the masses understand this story in a manner appropriate to them, i.e., that the world was created in time and <i>ex nihilo</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">47. This alludes to Kaspi’s opinion that Maimonides accepted the Aristotelian doctrine of the Eternity of the universe, so that God’s priority was causal, not temporal. See especially <i>‘Ammudei Kesef</i> (AM 99–101), and Mesch, <i>Studies</i>, pp. 96 ff.</i> Yet (it was not necessary) that they understand it in as crude a manner as they do. Certainly it is not correct for the complete sage to understand (these things) in the same manner as does the absolute fool, and certainly not when it comes to intelligibles, for how can we equate an angel with matter?<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">48. In Heb. <i>ḥomer</i>. It is possible that the original reading was <i>ḥamor</i> (i.e., “ass”), with the <i>vav</i> repositioned, providing the smoother “how could an angel be equated with an ass?”</i> Consequently it was necessary to write that the people who left there (in the divided generation) settled (in the land of Shinar), because of the narratives of the Creation, of the flood, and of the ark resting on Mount Ararat,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">49. Gen. 8:4.</i> i.e., in the lands of Babylon and Shinar, as is written regarding Sennacherib.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">50. Isa. 37:38.</i> Even prior to the divided generation, the author of the Torah was careful to write of other lands and languages in the context of the three sons of Noah.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">51. Gen. 10 speaks of various lands and languages even prior to the division in chap. 11.</i> This being the case, the verse “And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">52. Gen. 11:1.</i> does not refer to “earth” as an all-inclusive term<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">53. The MS is unclear at this point. According to this reading, the meaning is that the area where the following events occurred was a limited one, not covering the entire earth, for there were already many different lands and languages. Such a reading would accord with Kaspi’s explanation (in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i>, MK II 16–17) of “and there was not a man to till the ground” (Gen. 2:5), where he says that in other places there were men to till the ground. See S. Pines, “Histabberut Ha-Teḳumah Me-Ḥadash shel Medinah Yehudit le-fi Yosef Ibn Kaspi u-le-fi Spinoza,” <i>Iyyun</i> XIV (1963), p. 289, n. 2.</i> … in <i>Kesef Sigim</i>.

Chapter 7

The explanation<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. In <i>Ṃasref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 51) Kaspi says that this vision “is explained in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> …”</i> of Abraham’s first vision, beginning “After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Gen. 15:1.</i> needs to be written, because this vision is subtle and profound. In the first place, I will say that to understand the vision of the Sundering, (one should know that) the purpose of the Torah in writing all the details of this story was to inform us that this (vision actually) took place involving Abraham our forefather and the Lord; and also to inform us what it was that Abraham said to the Lord and what the Lord said to Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 77) he explains that there was no speaking, for it occurred in Abraham’s sleep; their dialogue was comparable to a dream, involving a mental exchange between God and Abraham.</i> | Abraham’s actions occurred literally, in a manner similar to what is recorded in the Book of Job.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. He means that both Abraham and Job are described in Scripture as historical personalities.</i> And even though it is possible to say that Job and his friends never existed, the same could not be said of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. This was a doctrine espoused by certain Provençal philosophers who allegorized certain passages and personalities in the Bible, most notably those of Abraham and Sarah. For a greater discussion of this, see above pp. 6 ff. and 37.</i> No matter what, we had patriarchs of old, for we did not spring out of the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. The question of the historicity of Job occurs in the Talmud (BT <i>Bava‘ Batra‘</i> 15a), where there is an opinion that Job never existed. Maimonides, in <i>Guide</i> III:22, appears to maintain this as an open possibility, and Kaspi likewise leaves the question open. See below chap. XVIII, where this is mentioned again.</i>
Having said this, I will (now) explain this episode accurately. I can affirm that in writing this story, the author of the Torah intended to teach us many important things, (to be learnt from) every statement and every affirmation, as is clear. Thus, in the first place, from the specific statement “in a vision,”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Here Kaspi notices an apparent redundancy, for this term is not usually found in prophetic visions. On Kaspi’s attitude toward the description of Scriptural details, see below.</i> we learn that wherever it is written that “the word of the Lord came to so-and-so” or “And the word of the Lord came” or “And the Lord said,” and similarly, “And the Lord spoke,” or whenever the Lord’s word is spoken of as coming to a prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. He means to include here every prophetic inspiration or appearance of the “holy spirit.”</i> whether it be in a vision or a sight, for they are the same, or whether it be in a dream, it always comes as a force settling on the prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> II:36) describes prophecy as “an overflowing from God” that settles on the soul of the prophet.</i> as will be explained in several places.
“I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceeding great.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Gen. 15:1.</i> The intention of these words is to material reward in this world, even though the words “shield” and “reward” could be understood as referring to a spiritual (reward), such as in the world to come, (but such a spiritual sense) is unlikely according to the Hebrew usage.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Among the commentaries, Nachmanides and Gersonides explained the reference as to this world; Kimḥi and Seforno interpret the reward as applied to the next world. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 78) Kaspi explains that promises of reward in the next world are not in need of prophetic confirmation—they can be adduced through intellectual means. Consequently, the present confirmation would refer to the world of the senses.</i> Proof is from the preceding “Fear not, Abram,” for “fear” (<i>yir’ah</i>) in its Hebrew usage can only be used in the context of this-worldly fear, of whatever kind it might be, or else the absence of what is good. Further proof of this is that evidently Abraham took it in the same way, (from his words) “what wilt thou give me since I go hence childless.” God even explained the reward to him: “he that comes forth out of thy own bowels shall be thine heir.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. V. 4.</i> The complete statement, from “thy reward shall be exceeding great” until “so shall thy seed be,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. Vv. 1–5.</i> did not add any new information from God, for it is not necessary that the Torah should (always) say something new on account of people’s talk.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. On the role of Scriptural redundancies and Kaspi’s doctrine that “the Torah speaks in the language of men,” see above pp. 59 ff.</i>
Now a prophet, or anyone else, should not pray to the Lord to renew His favor, nor should he request reassurance of the Lord’s earlier words. Accordingly, when the Lord had said to Abraham, “thy reward shall be exceeding great,” Abraham requested an explanation of the words | “reward” and “great.” God then explained these terms to him at length, as well as the phrase “I am thy shield,” which was added to them. This is similar to “Hast thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house and about all that he has on every side.?”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Job 1:10, meaning that God would protect Abraham, as He did for Job.</i> Now Abraham says two things: firstly, regarding the Lord’s closing statement with which He had left Abraham, and which being so important was therefore concise,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Later in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, fol. 152a, Kaspi states that the importance and profundity of Scriptural description, vary inversely with the length of any given passage, so that the shorter the description, the more important it is.</i> Abraham says, “What wilt thou give me?” This is in reference to any future rewards that might be bestowed. (Secondly), regarding the Lord’s opening words, “I am thy shield,” which is in reference to what is already in Abraham’s possession, Abraham says, “That which you protect can only benefit Eliezer, who, because I have no son, is necessarily my (only) inheritor.” Subsequently, having stated the Lord’s words and their explanation, the giver of the Torah records that Abraham believed in the Lord, “and He counted it to him for righteousness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. V. 6.</i>
Then the giver of the Torah wrote that the Lord, in speaking with Abraham again, promised that he would inherit this land, the land of Canaan. While this had already been promised, (it is repeated here) for the promise to Abraham was to be repeated twice. (This happened) the first time in “unto thy seed will I give this land,”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Gen. 12:17.</i> and the second time in “to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Gen. 13:15. Both these verses state that the land will be given to Abraham (“thee”), but in fact the land was possessed only by his descendants. Kaspi now explains the answer.</i> This teaches us of three modes of expression, for on occasion Hebrew will refer to “a man” and intend his seed. This is because it is correct to associate a father with what will happen to his seed, and vice versa. This is something precious in the prophetic books,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 39) he says, “one of the secrets of the Torah is that it usually associates the father with what is intended for the son, and vice versa.”</i> (such as) in the words of the Lord to Elijah<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. I Kings 21:29, where Elijah foretells the fall of Ahab, only to defer the decree till the period of Ahab’s descendants. This is consistent with Kaspi’s position that no divine decree can be rescinded, it can only be understood in a new light. See <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 286 ff.).</i> when Ahab’s fate was foretold (by God). Remember this.
In this context the giver of the Torah taught us another precious lesson. This is (occasioned by the fact) that even the initial promise, that which promised the bestowal (of children),<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. The word <i>zera‘</i> is found in the margin of the MS.</i> had already been promised several times by the Lord. It had been written first as “unto thy seed will I give all this land,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Gen. 12:7.</i> and more specifically the second time in “I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. Arise walk through the land …”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24 Gen. 13:16–17.</i> Accordingly, these promises having already been made, (God’s) words here are superfluous and repetitious. Abraham’s words present other problems, for in regard to the promise of the land, the Torah says, “And he believed in the Lord,” yet on the two previous occasions this is not stated. Did he not | believe until the third time?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. The question is raised by other exegetes. Nachmanides had answered by quoting Jer. 18:9–10, where the prophetic decree of blessing is changed to punishment. It is interesting that Kaspi quotes these very vv. in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 287) to prove his point against Maimonides’ insistence that only decrees of punishment are subject to change, yet here Kaspi does not explain Abraham’s behavior as motivated by a fear that he might have misunderstood God’s initial promise.</i> (This is even more questionable) for he did already have faith, proof being that after each vision it states, “And he builded there an altar unto the Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. Gen. 12:7, 13:18.</i> (The answer to all these questions) is that this is all to teach us that it is proper for a king to make promises to his servants many times in various ways, on some occasions the servant will remain silent, while at other times he will answer and question. This is certainly the case when the king’s words incorporate words and names that are equivocal.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. In <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> (AK II 51) he says, “words and decrees are given by God to the prophet, and sometimes they are not understood at all, or understood only in part …”</i> In this instance “seed” and “son” are equivocal terms, for one can correctly refer thereby either to a blood-relative or to one who is merely nurtured by (an adoptive) father, as is the case with “and was unto him as a daughter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. II Sam. 12:3. In the MS <i>le-vat</i> instead of <i>ke-vat</i>. Kimḥi makes a similar point when he says that “seed” could refer to one of the members of his family, as in the verse “speaking peace to all his seed” (Esther 10:3).</i> Because all this is imaginable, and is similar to what is mentioned in the <i>Metaphysics</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. The passage in question occurs in the <i>Metaphysics</i> V, 15, fol. 1021a: “For it is in this way that the father is called the father of his son; for the one has acted and the other has been acted upon in a certain way.” See above nn. 20–21.</i> Abraham therefore inquired on this third occasion if (God’s) words intended the (servant) living in his house. God then explained to him that “he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels (shall be thine heir).” Thus, God’s words having been reiterated several times, Abraham trusted and believed even more.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. Kimḥi explained what these several times were: first God said, “Out of thine own bowels”; then he is taken outside to see the stars as a sign that this will come true; finally God mentions His own name as if to swear by it.</i>
Because (the promise of seed) was destined to be fulfilled in his own lifetime, and was not fraught with dangers, Abraham did not request a sign as he had done regarding the promise of entry into the land, which was in the distant future and accompanied by pronounced danger.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. Gersonides gives as the reason for this request: “for he did not know if his descendants would merit the necessary divine providence.” Here once again (cf. above n. 25) Kaspi chooses not to press this point against Maimonides.</i> Furthermore (he did not continue to ask for signs) for the longer a sage and a prophet continue to have recourse to the intellect, they become more and more casuistic. Here, (further) request for signs would have been casuistic, shrewd, and devious, even had that request been for a proof that was speculative or prophetic.

Chapter 8

The elect and most wise sages, may their memory be blessed, said that “Moses wrote his book and the Book of Job.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. BT <i>Bava’ Batra’</i> 14b.</i> Elsewhere they said that “Job never existed, for he was but a parable.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Ibid. 15a. A casual comparison might lead one to conclude that neither Job nor the patriarchs existed. See above Chapter 1 regarding allegorical exegesis.</i> Their intention was to say that Moses composed the Book of Job, in his wisdom, to inform us of great truths,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. In his commentary to the Book of Job (AS I 137), Kaspi takes issue with Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> III:22–23) for leaving the question of Job’s existence unresolved. Kaspi insists on the literal comprehension of “There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job” (Job 1:1), for “if we doubt the existence of Job … we could doubt the existence of all the personalities in the Bible … and if some of our ancestors did not know his time and place, that is not important, for I believe that he existed as recorded …”</i> similar to what is said of the earliest philosophers. Such is the work written by Ibn Zur‘a that tells the parable of the argument of man with the rest of the animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. This tenth-century translator of Aristotle’s <i>Historia Animalium</i> used logic and philosophy in studying the Bible, like Kaspi. Cf. <i>Encyclopedia of Islam</i>, s.v. “Ibn Zur‘a.” His writings are mostly lost.</i> When a story is told as if it actually happened, one can learn from the dialogue several matters in practical philosophy, as well as precious things regarding natural science, whose goal is the attainment of the perfection and immortality of the soul. This is true of the Book of Job in every respect.
There is no doubt | that the first man existed, as did Noah, the patriarchs, and the (twelve) tribes. God forbid that the (sages), in attributing both (the Torah and Job) to Moses, meant thereby that the Torah is similar to Job in this respect. Their intention, rather, was to state that the Torah, like (Job), contains fundamental aspects of practical and theoretical philosophy. (Their statement) also teaches us that in the Torah some places contain parables and metaphors, including the episode (in the life) of Abraham regarding the heifer and the she-goat and ram, as well as that entire parable, and the incident of Jacob’s ladder,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Gen. 28:12.</i> etc. This is especially true of this book (of Genesis) in the Torah, for in my opinion it is this book which the sages referred to as “the work of Creation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. BT <i>Megillah</i> 25a, <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 1.</i> The most profound part of (Genesis) is the section concluding, “But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Gen. 6:8. He means that the “work of Creation” refers essentially to the chapters preceding the flood in Gen. 6. On the importance that Kaspi attaches to the various divisions of the Scriptures, see above Chapter 2.</i> The book (of Genesis), containing in its entirety all that transpired before the birth of Moses, is the most important book in the Torah. This fact (of it having taken place prior to the birth of Moses) constitutes one of the special aspects of Genesis, for the Book of Exodus, and the following books, were easy (for Moses) to write, having seen everything with his own eyes. It was difficult, however, (to write) of what had occurred thousands of years earlier. Nevertheless, for Moses it was “but a small thing,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. BT <i>Berakhot</i> 33b.</i> for nothing in the past was beyond Moses’ ability to write, even that which occured thousands of years previously. (It was no more difficult) than writing of what was to occur in years to come, as I will explain elsewhere. As a rule, whatever Moses wrote regarding past and future (events), he knew and wrote in accordance with the word (of God), for everything was conveyed to him from the Lord, or if you will, from heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Kaspi insists that all of the Torah is from heaven, including all of Deuteronomy, “as those of us who philosophize know” (MK I 110). The final verses of Deuteronomy were likewise included, for “those things that relate to future events are no different from (future predictions in) the rest of the Torah” (MK II 310).</i> This is especially true of those stories in Genesis referring to the past, for they are all categorical, i.e., anecdotal,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 1) Kaspi divides the Torah into two kinds of statements: (a) <i>’Omer gozer</i> (narrative), (b) <i>’Eino gozer</i> (prescriptive). Only the former affirms some truth, for a command does not state any facts. He discusses this further in the <i>Ṣeror Ha-Kesef</i> (fol. 231b). Kaspi’s position here is similar to that of Alfarabi in <i>Five Chapters of Logic</i> (MS Vatican 49, fol. 106a), stating: “the philosophical narrative is that which is called demonstrative, and its purpose is to teach the truth and to cause to understand …” This is quoted in Mesch, <i>Studies</i>, p. 86. See also H. Blumberg, “Alfarabi’s Five Chapters on Logic,” <i>PAAJR</i> VI (1934), pp. 119–121.</i> statements. This is true of many preceding matters. Even though the sages said, “the (entire) Torah given at Sinai was written in black fire upon white fire,”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. JT <i>Shekalim</i> 6:1, <i>Canticles Rabbah</i> 5:9. The statement does not distinguish between different books of the Torah.</i> my opinion is that they were referring primarily to Genesis, for it is the most important (of all), being “apples of gold in settings of silver.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Prov. 25:11, which is quoted in the Introduction to the <i>Guide</i> in reference to the exoteric and underlying esoteric levels of Scripture.</i> | This (last verse) is especially true of Genesis, as it contains the exalted secrets and mysteries of the Torah, as well as the commandments of the heart<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. In Hebrew <i>miṣvot libbiyot</i>. Kaspi divides the commandments into three classes (of the heart, of action, of the tongue). All are necessary, yet the first of these is the most important. As he puts it, “were we angels we would need only the commandments of the intellect [i.e., of the heart] (MK I 6). This classification follows Ibn Ezra’s <i>Yesod Mora’</i> (Prague, 1833), pp. 27–32, which is referred to in <i>‘Ammudei Kesef</i> (AM 134). Cf. Mesch, <i>Studies</i>, pp. 84 ff.</i> that subsequently occur in the Torah in the form of nonanecdotal statements,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. He is referring to commandments, which are as a class prescriptive, as opposed to the narrative statements which are categorical.</i> such as “I am the Lord thy God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Exod. 20:2.</i> “thou shalt have no other Gods,”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16.

Lev. 19:14, 32; 25:17, 36, 43.</i> All these (commandments) come in the book (of Genesis) in narrative and anecdotal form.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Cf. above n. 10. Maimonides also explains that Scriptural narrative is a necessary utility for the law, when he says (<i>Guide</i> III:50): “Either they give a correct notion of an opinion that is a pillar of the law, or they rectify some action so that wrongdoing and aggression should not occur between men.”</i> For this reason the sages praised this book by referring to it as “the work of Creation,” as stated above.

Chapter 9

The wise know that a term when used as a verb can refer equally to a distant and a proximate agent, and that these adjectives (distant, proximate) can be understood in varying degrees, both more and less.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. This refers to Gen. 15:7, “I am the Lord that brought thee out from Ur Kasdim …” which is here interpreted as referring to God acting through intermediate causes. This is similar to Maimonides’ statement in the <i>Guide</i> II:48 affirming that actions are attributed directly to God, even when His will is realized through a natural framework of causes.</i> Therefore in saying “act, do, make, create, move, bring forth, write, speak, say, build, destroy, forbid, permit, give, leave, eat, see, hear, remember,” as well as every verb used in any expression, it is correct, necessary, and proper to affirm, absolutely and without qualification, that (such verbs) can refer equally to the nearest agent and the furthest. In the Torah this (affirmation) has reference to the Lord, for He is above all the Separate Intelligences, the Heavenly Spheres, and so much more above earthly matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. On these worlds, and the divine role, see above chap. I.</i> (This is the meaning of the verse) “And He made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Num. 32:13.</i> meaning that the Lord on high caused the Israelites to move, but (in such a way that) He was necessarily only the distant, prime mover, while Moses was the most proximate external (cause). To this one can add “writes,” “says,” and “speaks” (when attributed to God in the Torah) as well as the other verbs that I may or may not have mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 65) Kaspi writes, “the agent and the one acted on join together, so in several ways the agent is considered as acted upon.” He quotes, “and Joseph made ready his chariot” (Gen. 46:29), where Joseph only issued the command that this be done. So too is “So Solomon built the house” (I Kings 6:14).</i>
Regarding that which Moses wrote in the Torah, that “I am the Lord that brought thee out from Ur Kasdim, to give thee this land to inherit it: And he said, ‘O Lord, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?’”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Gen. 15:7–8.</i> (we learn that) from these words God promised Abraham that in the future the land (of Canaan) would be completely inherited by his descendants, as was realized by Joshua. Abraham then asked for a sign and proof of this (promise), for | his words “whereby shall I know” are no different from those attributed by the writer of the Book of Kings to Hezekiah when he said, “What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me?”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. II Kings 20:8. In <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> (AK I 73) the reader is referred to the <i>Gevia’ Kesef</i>, in explaining that Hezekiah, like Abraham here, did not request proof because he doubted God.</i> It was also no worse than that written in the Torah that the Lord on his own accord informed Moses, “This shall be the token unto thee that I have sent thee.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Exod. 3:12.</i> As a rule, a prophet or a sage may at times request a sign or proof, while at other times he may rely in the matter on other things. Sometimes the teacher may provide (the sign) of his own accord, or from a recognition that his student doubts his words to a greater or lesser degree. Either he will provide rational proof or else (he will do it in such a way) that others will not doubt. This is similar to Aristotle’s mentioning in his book signs and proofs of the continued existence of the heavens, for the benefit of his students.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. Aristotle, <i>De Caelo</i>, I, 10–12, which proves that the heaven is necessarily ungenerated and indestructible.</i> There are others like this, as Maimonides wrote in (the <i>Guide</i>) I:21.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. I have not located such a reference in that chapter of the <i>Guide</i>.</i>
While we cannot compare or equate the Torah to other books, nor can we compare Moses, who wrote the Torah, with other authors, (nor can we compare them to) the Lord, who was the prime writer and giver of the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. This establishes the exact referent for the less precise phrasings that are found elsewhere in the <i>Gevia’ Kesef</i>, such as “the writer of the Torah” and “the bestower of the Torah.” See also AK I 136.</i> nonetheless we may conceive of a relation between this holy book and its meaning, and other books, by way of analogy.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Cf. below chap. X, n. 16.</i> This is similar, for example, to our describing Natural Matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. In Heb. <i>hiyyuli ha-tiv‘i</i>, which in Aristotelian metaphysics is the cosmic First Matter, from which all matter is derived.</i> which is the work of God, by analogy to the lowly product, i.e., a container of urine.
For this reason, (we can explain) that when Abraham the student (of God) asked for a sign and proof from his great teacher, the Lord, that He should verify in any way what had been asserted, it was just as Alexander might have asked of his teacher, Aristotle,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. In 343 <small>B.C.E. </small>Aristotle was invited to Pella by Philip of Macedon, to undertake the education of his son Alexander, who was then thirteen years old. When Alexander (later to be known as Alexander the Great) ascended the throne in 336, Aristotle returned to his native city. See F. Copleston, <i>A History of Philosophy</i>, vol. I, pt. II (Garden City: Image Books, 1962), pp. 10–11.</i> or ’Abaye of Rava’ his teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. The MS has <i>Rava</i> ’, but ’Abbaye’s teacher was in fact Rabbah, according to Rashi’s comments on BT <i>Shabbat</i> 5b, s.v. <i>mi-de’amar</i>.</i> Everything is according to the occupation and level of the individual, for “the fool will believe everything, while the wise will understand well,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Prov. 14:5.</i> or in any case (the wise) will want to know the meaning to the greatest possible extent. Such is the nature of the questions that sages ask of the Lord, and that the prophets ask and are praised for. It is through this that “The Lord rejoices in his works.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Ps. 104:31.</i> Thus when Abraham said, | “Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old?,”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. Gen. 17:17.</i> it was the same as Moses’ saying, “If flocks and herds be slain, will they suffice them?”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Num. 11:22.</i> There are many passages like this.
In answer, the Lord tells him, “Take me a heifer of three years old” until “And Abram drove them away,” and then, “It came to pass that, when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and He said unto Abram, ‘… for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.’ … and it came to pass when the sun went down …”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Gen. 15:9–17.</i> One should know that occasionally it is the custom of the Lord to inform the prophets, his students, of future things that will come to pass, using phrases and words that occur in the form of parable and metaphor, as was done in the case of Jacob’s parable of the ladder with its appropriate (symbols).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Gen. 28:12.</i> It was similar in the case of Ezekiel, when all of Metaphysics occurred in a parable;<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. Ezek. 1.</i> in the case of Jeremiah with regard to the future, in the parables that begin, “I see the rod of an almond tree” and “the seething pot”;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. Jer. 1:11, 13.</i> and in the case of Amos, in the parables that begin “Plumbline” and a “basket of summer fruit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Amos 7:7, 8:1. These parables are discussed in the <i>Guide</i> II:43.</i> In these cases it is not necessary that the words always come in one form, for it is in accordance with a teacher’s wisdom that he makes changes in his words, while retaining the original meaning. What is meant by this is shown when on occasion the Lord inquires of a prophet, “What do you see,” and the prophet answers, “I see thus and so,” to which the Lord replies, “The explanation is thus and so.” This is what occurred in the cases of Jeremiah and Amos, mentioned above. Sometimes not all the details of the question and answer are mentioned, as when the Lord merely provides the parable for the “student,” who later establishes his own explanation.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. This assertion is consistent with Kaspi’s doctrine that many divine decrees are only understood in the light of subsequent events, avoiding the need to postulate changes in divine decrees. See <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 289).</i> This happened to Ezekiel, when the Lord provided him with a parable,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. Ezek. 37.</i> in which, according to the most outstanding of our sages, “the dead in Ezekiel were a parable.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 92b.</i> And even though the Lord subsequently provided him with an explanation, saying, “These bones are the whole house of Israel, and I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live,”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. Ezek. 37:11, 14. In <i>‘Ammudei Kesef</i> (AM 8) Kaspi says that even though this chapter occurred in a vision, as a parable, there is no doubt that “the resurrection of the dead is true.”</i> it was not necessary for Him to say to Ezekiel, “Know that these bones are the whole house of Israel,” for had He omitted this, the meaning would have been retained, and the omission would have been correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 27) Kaspi says similarly, “we will not give a reason for each word [of a Scriptural parable] in every place. Instead we will give a reason in general …” Kaspi moulded his commentaries on Scriptural use of parable, sometimes explaining at length, at other times in brief.</i>
Accordingly, as Maimonides said,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. Introduction to the <i>Guide</i>.</i> it is not always necessary that all the details of a parable | and its interpretation be identical. Here (in the vision of the Sundering) the parable includes everything from the term “heifer” until the words “and Abram drove them away.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. V. 11.</i> The interpretation extends from “thy seed shall be a stranger” until “is not yet full.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. Vv. 13–16.</i> Accordingly, while the solution covers four verses, it is found in only two verses: i.e., “Know of a surety” and “In the fourth generation.” It excludes “for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full,” for these two other verses do not explain what is in the parable, but rather they provide new information that together with the others relates to what was intended for Abraham. Now the Lord, (like) a teacher, was careful to conceal in the middle that which was not part of the main explanation of the parable, as is proper for one who wishes to conceal and hide,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. The MS here has <i>le-ha’amin</i>, meaning “to foster trust,” a rather unusual form of the verb in the present context. More appropriate would be a reading <i>le-haṭmin</i>, lit. “to hide.”</i> as I have explained in regard to Jacob’s words “as long as men come to Shiloh.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. Gen. 49:10. This refers to a passage in the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 105) where he rebuts the Christological interpretation that claims that the word <i>shiloh</i> is a reference to Jesus. At one point there he states that these four letters (<i>shiloh</i>) “are hidden and intermingled, so that no one should notice them unless he has very keen sight …”; i.e., the term is included to confuse and mislead, so as to hide the true meaning of the verse. <br>Leo Strauss, in an essay on the methods that Maimonides utilized in the <i>Guide</i> to conceal and reveal the truth, enumerates this very same point as a primary vehicle for such a literary feat. See L. Strauss, “The Literary Character of the <i>Guide for the Perplexed,” Persecution and the Art of Writing</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), p. 52.</i> Likewise there are other words in the parable that are not an integral part of the intended promise, including “and he laid each half over against the other,”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. V. 10.</i> as I will explain later. It appears from all of this that the Lord wanted to reveal to Abraham that some of his seed would be slaves in a strange land not owned by them, but He did not want to reveal to him which land (that would be), except to tell him that the fourth generation would escape from that servitude. This is what occurred in Egypt, as it is written, “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation,” and then, “Now there arose a new king over Egypt,”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. Exod. 1:6.</i> which began the enslavement of the tribes. Included were the generations of Kohath, Amram, and Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. Rashi refers to the four generations as Judah, Pereẓ, Ḥeẓron, and Caleb. Nachmanides understands the reference to be to four generations of Amorites. Kaspi here follows Kimḥi’s listing of the generations. For further discussion of this, see C. Gordon, “Hebrew Origins in the Light of Recent Discovery,” in <i>Biblical and Other Studies</i>, ed. A. Altmann (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963), p. 4.</i> Thus, the words “thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them” accord with the manner of every wise teacher, and are certainly appropriate words for the great teacher who is the Lord.
“Thy seed shall be a stranger” refers to Egypt, saying that his seed would serve and be afflicted by the Egyptians.
“Four hundred years” has no allusion in the parable, but it was considered correct by the teacher to reveal the complete explanation and intended meaning at that point. This figure is related to “thy seed shall be a stranger,” but the phrase “and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them” is not necessarily part of the figure (of four hundred years). In a sense it would be correct | to say that they were afflicted for (four hundred years) during all that time, for it is the lot of every stranger (to be afflicted).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. This is an attempt by Kaspi to answer the problem of the actual duration of the stay in Egypt, which would appear to have lasted less than the four hundred years foretold in Gen. 15:13. Gersonides considered the four-hundred-year period to have begun with Jacob’s birth; Kaspi follows Rashi, who computes the period from the birth of Isaac, and follows Kimḥi, who had stated that “affliction” could also refer to a condition of alienation, such as that which Isaac and Jacob experienced.</i> Reliable evidence of this (affliction) is provided by the (names) of the wells dug by Isaac, called <i>‘Eseḳ</i> (“contention”) and <i>Siṭnah</i> (“enmity”),<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38.

Actually Isaac never lived in Egypt. One explanation might be that Kaspi alludes to Isaac’s sojourn in the land of the Philistines, to the south of the land of Canaan, in Gen. 26.</i> a fact which justifies the figure of four hundred years, and removes any inconsistency. However, part of (the four hundred years) was more intense and literal as far as the words “serve” and “afflict.” (This is consistent) with what I mentioned above, saying that descriptive words can be used in an exact literal sense, and also in a loose sense.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">41. See below.</i> The Lord revealed to Abraham that the words “thy seed shall be a stranger” referred to three generations, when He stated afterwards “the fourth generation …” That fourth generation was the one that entered the land in the time of Joshua, the generation that was led about in the desert having been the third generation that endured in part the suffering in Egypt, starting on the day that Moses was born and continuing until the time of the burning bush, when he was eighty years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">42. Exod. 3:2. Kaspi computes this age by the fact that at his death Moses was 120 years old, which was after 40 years in the desert; therefore Moses was 80 when he appeared at Mount Sinai the first time.</i> (In this matter) it is not necessary to detail the components and the people involved.
The explanation of the parable (of the Sundering) is that the three animals that are mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">43. In Heb. <i>shilush</i>, lit. “triplicate.”</i> are a metaphor for the three generations discussed above, while the turtle-dove and the young pigeon refer to the fourth generation. The Lord commanded him to sunder the three species so that their blood could be offered to the Lord. The words “all these” (“he took him …”) refers only to the livestock, in that later it is written, “but the birds divided he not.” The word “all” poses no problem (by implying that Abraham took everything) to one who knows the holy language.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">44. In the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 162) Kaspi says, “the word <i>kol</i> [all] in Hebrew and its equivalent in Provençal are used when referring to the major portion of anything, just as long as a large number is involved …”</i> All of this refers to the beating and pursuing of the Israelites that took place during those three generations,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">45. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 81) they are described as “tortured and dissipated.”</i> which resulted in their being considered corpses.

This is in reference to the <i>Metaphysics</i> V, 16, 1021b, where Aristotle says that “we say a thing has been completely spoilt and completely destroyed when it in no way falls short of destruction and badness, but is at its last point. That is why death too is by a figure of speech called the end, because both are last things.”</i> and certainly in view of what is written in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">47. The meaning of likeness is not discussed in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, but in the <i>Metaphysics</i> X, 3, 1054b, the following is found: “things are alike, if, not being absolutely the same, nor without difference in respect of their concrete substance, they are the same in form … other things are alike, if having the form, and being things in which difference of degree is possible, they have no difference of degree.”</i> and the <i>De Caelo</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">48.

The fact that the birds were not sundered, i.e., the turtle-dove and the young pigeon, was in reference to the absence of persecution | of the fourth generation at the hands of the Egyptians.
The meaning of the birds of prey that descended, which included birds that stamp on their prey, as is known from Jeremiah’s words,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">49.

An alternative explanation of these words is that the references to Jeremiah and Ezekiel are to Jer. 12:9 and Ezek. 39:4, both of which use the phrase generically (cf. <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> AK II 8). But the problem with this is that if so, the words included in the brackets remain unexplained. Kimḥi, in his commentary to this verse, also includes the “birds of prey” as a generic term that refers to birds that stamp.</i> is in reference to the coming together of all the Egyptians, king and people, for the purpose of enslaving them.

When Abraham drove away the stamping birds of prey that drink blood,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">54.

The Lord, as a teacher would do, described three species of animal to Abraham—a heifer, a she-goat, and a ram. These were, as noted earlier, a parable and metaphor for the three generations of Jews who were strangers and servants. The number is appropriate: three species that correspond to three generations. The number “three” is a properly equivocal term, for the intent is to one she- goat, one heifer, and one ram, a sum of three, with each one constituting a third, no matter which one is placed first, which one second, and which one third.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">55. I have not found a precedent for this explanation. Rashi, Nachmanides, and Kimḥi all explain that there were three animals of each type. Nachmanides, however, is aware that according to that explanation, the term <i>sheloshah</i> would have been preferable to the uncommon <i>meshulash</i>. Ibn Ezra and Gersonides explain that the animals were to be three years old. Kaspi elsewhere (MK I 80, MK II 52) is unclear but it would appear that there he follows Rashi. Here, however, he makes it clear that there was one animal of each type, so that each was one-third of the total.</i> Now (the Lord) as the teacher, mentioned these three animals three times, to emphasize and reinforce that this was indeed coming from God.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">56. Later (chap.

I can now explain the meaning of the words <i>‘eglah</i> (“heifer”), <i>‘ez</i> (“she-goat”), and <i>’ayil</i> (“ram”) in accordance with their precise significance. (This is possible) as these things are unlike sacrifices, of which Maimonides said that it is impossible for them to be without some species or number.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">62. <i>Guide</i> III:26.</i> The Torah describes the congregation of Israel first as a heifer (<i>‘eglah</i>), which is customary, as it is written, “Ephraim is a heifer well-broken.”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">63. Hos. 10:11.</i> Furthermore, <i>‘eglah</i> is derived from <i>‘agol</i> (“circle”), as in a continuously revolving cycle that alludes to (that which repeats itself) in our patriarchs and ourselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">64. This alludes to the rabbinic dictum that “the deeds of the fathers are a sign for their descendants” (BT <i>Soṭah</i> 34a).</i> A meaning is also found through metathesis<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">65. Kaspi’s use of metathesis in the understanding of Biblical terms has been discussed at length above in Chapter 2. Kaspi considers these <i>mehupakhim</i> to be an important tool in exegesis, one that presupposes an intimate knowledge of the Hebrew language (cf. <i>Menorat Kesef</i>, AS II 108). Kaspi’s main source for this method is Ibn Janaḥ’s <i>Sefer Ha-Riḳmah</i>, ed. M. Wilensky (Jerusalem: Academy for the Hebrew Language, 1964), vol. I, p. 362, and ed. note, tracing this usage to Saadya.</i> in a manner that is similar to Maimonides’ allusion regarding <i>regel-‘egel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">66. <i>Guide</i> II:43.</i> Accordingly, (the metathesis of <i>‘egel</i>) is <i>ge‘olah</i> (“loathing”), as in “thy soul loathed,”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">67. Jer. 14:9.</i> similar to what Maimonides noted in connection with <i>ḥovel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">68. <i>Guide</i> II:43.</i> a verb whose metathesis is <i>vohel</i>, alluding to “and their soul also loathed me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">69. Zech. 11:8.</i> (<i>‘Egel</i> thus) refers to the fact that the (Israelites in Egypt) would be loathsome in their servitude.
<i>‘Ez</i> (“she-goat”) alludes to <i>‘oz</i> (“strength”), for it would require much fortitude to endure the suffering in Egypt, (and necessitate their turning to) Him who “giveth power to the faint.”<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">70. Isa. 40:29.</i> In addition (there is a reference) by way of metathesis in that <i>za‘</i> (“move”) implies that that generation would wander in that place.
<i>’Ayil</i> (“ram”)<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">71.

Ps. 88:5.</i> which gives it the meaning of “strength,” as with <i>‘oz</i>. The metathesis (of <i>’ayil</i>) is <i>ya’al</i>, which gives the meaning of one who desires other circumstances,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">73. See below in chap.

The turtle-dove and pigeon are birds that refer to the fourth generation, which would escape from there like a winged bird<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">77. In commenting on Isa. 28:5, Kaspi derives <i>ṣippor</i> (“bird”) from “rapid movement” (AK I 128).</i> to go to Israel, as explained above.

Ezek. 21:32. He means here that while the Israelites deserved to have their land ruined, Nebuchadnezzar also had a right to possess it.</i>
<i>Gozal</i> (“pigeon”) is likewise equivocal, in that it refers also to stealing (<i>gazal</i>). This term provides a complete description (of the generation entering the land) that is consistent with “they are a nation void of counsel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">85.

In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 75) Kaspi links the morality of Israel’s possession of the land to the principle that “Israel is not governed by the Zodiac” (BT <i>Nedarim</i> 32a), whereby there is a direct divine participation in the issue of when the Israelites are to take possession or be evicted from the land.

“And he laid each half over against the other”; this was only so that the flaming torch could pass between the sundered pieces so that the covenant could be made involving the Lord and Abram. By sundering these carcasses, (it was undertaken that the covenant) would not be sundered as they were.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">92. This symbolism is similar to that of sacrifices, in which the animal was offered so that the owner would be spared the same fate.</i> Such was the custom of old,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">93. Gersonides explained the significance as being a demonstration that the parties to the covenant are as one body, on account of the love between them.</i> as it is written, “they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof.”<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">94. Jer. 34:18. The phrase “to cut [<i>likhrot</i>] a treaty” is derived from the practice of severing animals as the seal of a treaty. This custom is widely attested to in ancient times and exists among primitive peoples to this day; particularly among Hittites and Greeks there are many parallels. It is generally believed that when the contracting parties passed between the severed pieces, they accepted the covenant obligations and invoked upon themselves the fate of the animals if the terms of the pact were violated. See the commentary of Bechor Shor, who says (regarding Gen. 15:9) that the custom was to pass between the sundered parts of an animal. See also N. Sarna, <i>Understanding Genesis</i> (New York: Schocken, 1970), p. 126, and W. F. Albright, <i>Archaeology and the Religion of Israel</i> (Baltimore, 1942), p. 113.</i> In this context, | <i>‘agal</i> could be understood as alluding to <i>‘agalah</i> (“carriage”).

“The pillar of fire” alludes to the glory of the Lord, for “the Lord thy God is a devouring fire,”<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">95. Deut. 4:24.</i> and the appearance of the Lord’s glory is that of a consuming fire.
“And also that nation whom they shall serve, will I judge, and afterward shall they come out with great substance.” Even though this is located in the explanation of the parable, it does not explain any words appearing in the parable, as I have stated above. Instead it contains a new teaching, unmentioned above. It is the same with “but thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in good old age,” which teaches that the promised destiny would not begin with himself, but with Isaac.
Notice another precise thing: throughout this vision there are three levels. Those coming later are more important than the earlier ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">96. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 88) Kaspi writes, “as the prophetic seclusion continues, the illumination of knowledge and perfection increases in degree, similar to the moon in the first half of the month … as opposed to the second half of the month, which is to be compared to the knowledge of generally known things [<i>mefursamot</i>].” See also MK II 45, AK I 21, AS II 133.</i> This is correct when anyone secludes himself in examination of his soul, whether in a dimension of intellectual (endeavor) or prophetic (endeavor), as the philosophers have written.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">97. This passage, and what follows it, reflects the following passage in the <i>Guide</i> II:41: “Prophetic revelation begins sometimes with a vision of prophecy. Thereupon the terror and the strong affection consequent upon the attainment of the perfection of the action of the imaginative faculty become intensified and then prophetic revelation comes, as is recounted of Abraham. For with regard to the beginning of that prophetic revelation, it is said: ‘The word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision.’ And with regard to its termination: ‘And a deep sleep fell upon Abram,’ and so on. And after that: ‘And He said unto Abram,’ and so on.”</i> The first (stage) of this important event occurred (on the level of prophecy described by the phrase) “in a vision do I make myself known unto him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">98. Num. 12:6.</i> That this stage took place at a specific hour during the day is proved by “when the sun was going down.”<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">99. He means that this stage occurred in the afternoon, when the sun was going down from its high point at noon.</i> When the day was coming to an end and the sun was about to set, Abram took strength a second time, and achieved a higher level. This is the meaning of “when the sun was going down.” The great seclusion caused: “a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a dread, even a great darkness, fell upon him.” At this level, greater than the preceding, the explanation of what had been hidden was achieved, i.e., the explanation of the (earlier) parable. This would happen with Jeremiah and Amos<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">100. Jer. 1; Amos 7:8.</i> in the wake of preceding (parables). Later Abraham took strength a third time, having preceded that with prophetic seclusion. (At that point) the sun had settled completely, so there was the intense darkness of night, even “thick darkness” (<i>‘alaṭah</i>), which was more intense than (mere) “darkness” (<i>ḥashekhah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">101. V. 17.</i> In addition (at this level) there was a smoking furnace, as there was at Mount Sinai, as it is said, “and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of the furnace.”<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">102. Exod. 19:19.</i> At this point the Lord’s glory came down upon him in the image of a flaming torch, passing between these sundered parts, and by passing through (them) made a covenant with Abraham, as it is said, “On that day God made a covenant with Abram, saying,”<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">103. V. 18.</i> where (“on that day”) means “at that moment.” | This is like “on the day that thou eatest thereof”<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">104. Gen. 2:17, where “on that day” clearly means “at that moment.”</i> (meaning “at that moment that thou eatest thereof”).
The expression “to make a covenant,” as well as any expression of an oath (by the Lord), occurs in the sense of “the Torah speaks in the language of men.”<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">105. BT <i>Bava’ Meṣi‘a’</i> 31b, BT <i>Yevamot</i> 71a. See above Chapter 2.</i> It merely conveys the idea of something permanent and necessary. Now even though (the subject of the covenant) referred to a future event, (the likelihood of its coming to be) was of the order of tomorrow’s sunrise (i.e., a certainty), and not of the order of rainfall on the morrow (which would be contingent).<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">106. The distinction between conclusions that are necessary and those that are contingent is an important part of the study of logic, at the basis of the laws of the syllogism. For further discussion of this aspect of Kaspi’s exegesis, see above pp. 44–46.</i> This promise of the land that was made to Abraham was more secure and well bound than any of the earlier promises made to him in this regard, for it was by way of a covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">107. Here Kaspi attempts to show that what appears to be mere repetition of an earlier promise, and therefore a redundancy, is in fact quite necessary. The question of Scriptural redundancy is discussed again on fol. 152 ff.</i> (This is shown) in truth by the fact that when Abraham asked of the Lord, “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?”, which the wise know was because one can only rely on that which is proved, the Lord’s answer was essentially to establish a covenant. The reason for this was that future events from the Lord of a prophetic nature (are proven by a covenant), just as things that exist at present are proven by a wise teacher who adduces conclusion from necessary and independent premises. It is known that the Lord interchanges modes, i.e., the prophetic modes and those of the rational sciences. Consequently Abraham inquired correctly when he said, “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?” and the Lord answered him correctly. This was similar to if Averroës had asked Aristotle, “How shall I know that every man is sentient?” to which the reply would have been, “Know that every man is an animal, and every animal is sentient.”<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">108. This is the type of syllogism of a categorical nature that is analyzed by Aristotle in the <i>Prior Analytics</i> I, 4, 25b. The same syllogism is found in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 154). On the use of this principle in Kaspi’s exegesis, see above pp. 44–46.</i> This was how Abraham, in an imprecise manner, inquired of the Lord, in accordance with the dimension of the prophetic mode, which is appropriate for future events. The Lord answered him with the appropriate means by making a necessary proof consisting of a covenant that verified that the future decree was necessary, not contingent. The Lord, however, preceded that proof by stating, “Take me a heifer …” and that entire passage, by way of introducing the desired statement, (to answer) the request to know that the matter was as necessary as tomorrow’s sunrise.
Accordingly, Abraham’s words “whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it” were as if he had said, “Lord God, | on several occasions you have promised me that ‘this land will I give unto you,’ but I do not know if this future decree is necessary or contingent, and therefore I am in doubt and afraid.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">109. Elsewhere (MK II 289, AK II 51) Kaspi explains that a prophet might be uncertain of the meaning of a divine statement, for a prophet has only the word-characters (<i>mahut ha-millot</i>) to go by. Here God’s words do not indicate whether the promise is necessary or contingent, so Abraham is unsure.</i> Explain this to me.” The Lord then fulfilled Abraham’s desire through the making of the covenant, which informed Abraham that (the promise) was a necessary one. It was for this reason that Abraham said “how shall I know” and did not say “how shall I believe” or “how shall I think” or “how is it possible,” as had been said earlier in regard to the two earlier promises, i.e., the promise of seed, and that of———.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">110. Here the MS is unclear, with the word <i>devaro</i> inserted.</i> In this regard, Maimonides explained <i>’emunah</i> (“faith”) and <i>ha’amanah</i> (“the act of believing”) in the <i>Guide</i> I:50. In the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> it has been explained that what is not known by means of a necessary proof is considered a “justifiable conception,” or a thought that is right and just.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">111. In the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> I, 33, 88b, Aristotle says: “opinion may be concerned with that which is true or false, and can be otherwise: opinion is in fact the grasp of a premise which is immediate but not necessary … (on the other hand scientific knowledge) is universal, and proceeds by necessary connections, and that which is necessary cannot be otherwise.”</i> It is similar with the mode of prophecy, for that which is not known with certainty, as the knowledge of the future rising of the sun, is described in these terms (i.e., “belief”). Therefore earlier it states, “And He counted it to him for righteousness” (i.e., Abraham’s acceptance of the promise of seed), for God had not informed Abraham that it was a necessary promise, and Abraham did not ask for such (assurance) except in this case (of the land), for whatever reason. It was only after Abraham did well in the binding of Isaac that the Lord, of His own accord, provided Abraham the necessary knowledge, i.e., the (necessary) great multiplication of his seed, in the words “by myself have I sworn.”<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">112. Gen. 22:16.</i> Had the Lord made (such) a covenant with Jacob, or sworn on the words “I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude,”<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">113. Gen. 32:13.</i> then Jacob would not have feared on account of Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">114. Gen. 32:8.</i> (His fear) was not because Jacob was foolish, he merely followed Abraham’s thinking (in not asking for such a covenant regarding seed), for Abraham did not ask “how shall I know …” in relation to the promise of his personal benefits, or of the multiplication of his seed. Those things were close in time to being fulfilled, as well as close in reality, for they were naturally probable. (This is) enough on this subject.
In the <i>Kesef Sigim</i> I asked what was the sin of Israel for which God decreed such troubles on them, | and I also said that in any case the writer of the Torah should not have mentioned their sufferings without (also mentioning) their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">115. Apparently the question was one of theodicy: How could this affliction in a strange land be deserved, if those people were not yet born?</i> For such (undeserved punishment) is considered evil and distasteful by the masses, and even by those few people (close to) the Lord. The answer is that the Lord did not intend this (decree) by way of suffering and punishment, neither did He intend to burden Abraham’s heart, for His intention throughout this vision was to impart good news to him. If one would ask, how can “and they shall serve them and they shall afflict them” be good news, the answer is to be found by asking, how could God’s promise to Manoah’s wife, stating “behold now, thou art barren … but thou shalt conceive and bear a son,”<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">116. Judg. 13:3.</i> be good news? After all (giving birth) involves the problems of suffering, pain, and fear, in accordance with the characterization of giving birth as “in pain thou shall bring forth children,”<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">117. Gen. 4:16.</i> i.e., conception and giving birth are compared to suffering. It is similar in the precise statement “as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children,”<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">118. Isa. 66:8.</i> where the term <i>ḥalah</i> is not related to <i>ḥayil</i> (“strength”). (In the case of Abraham) the tidings of a child and children are mentioned in a precise way in that they only mention the existence of the child (and not the suffering that precedes), when it says, “I will bless her and moreover I will give thee a son of her,”<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">119. Gen. 17:6.</i> and elsewhere, “I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh around, and lo, thy wife shall have a son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">120. Gen. 18:10.</i> This was as if to inform us that (God) did not wish her (to have) the pains preceding the birth of the child, for her benefit and satisfaction——— ———.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">121. At this point the MS has two words <i>sekhel veṭov</i> (“intelligent and good”) whose reference is unclear, for they could refer to God, to Sarah, or the child.</i> Yet it was impossible to achieve such a benefit without its preceding pains and suffering.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">122. At one point in Kaspi’s comments on Job (AS I 146), he says that the three friends of Job share the opinion that every righteous man properly experiences hardship, so that ultimately his happiness is increased.</i>
Reliable evidence for this is provided by those going to sea in ships who risk and endanger their lives in order to profit thousands of gold pieces when they reach their destination, and then they thank God for His mercies, as David has written.<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">123. Ps. 18:17–18, which repeats David’s praise in II Sam. 22:17: <br>He sent from on high, He took me; <br>He drew me out of many waters. <br>He delivered me from my enemy most strong.</i> Should they, on account of the dangers, avoid traveling on the sea or not rejoice at the profits? It is similar with the merchants traveling in the desert, and (the soldiers) who conquer cities in war, and in so doing suffer many things, including death. Why should I need to mention these examples, when the achievement of all benefits in the world is just like this. Even women and children know that a man achieves nothing by merely lying with his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">124. In <i>Ḥaṣoṣrot Kesef</i> (As I 59) Kaspi similarly rebukes the masses, who “think that intercourse is in itself good and proper, and who like cockerels are constantly with their wives.” On the other hand, however, in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 256) Kaspi says: “they have said, ‘the greater the man the greater his evil inclination’ [BT <i>Succah</i> 52a]; consequently Moses’ natural functions did not weaken even when he was eighty years old … so one should not think that Moses withdrew from women, for he was no Augustinian or Carmelite (monk).”</i>
Now this is especially true here (in the case of Abraham’s descendants in Egypt), when those problems mentioned, i.e., the servitude and affliction, are themselves the cause of “and afterwards they shall come out with great substance,” and “in the fourth generation they shall come back hither.” This is true for several reasons: Firstly, were it not | for (these problems), there would not have occurred “the children of Israel sighed … and their cry came up to God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">125. Exod. 2:23.</i> which was the essential reason that the Lord took them from Egypt. This is also true of “I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters.”<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">126. Exod. 3:7.</i> Had the children of Israel lived in Egypt in peace, and had none of this (affliction) existed, they would not have inherited the land of Canaan or built the Temple. The same applies (to all the benefits) listed in the <i>Hallel</i> in “how many degrees of goodness has God wrought with us,”<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">127. This refers to the Passover Haggadah, which quotes <i>Sifre’ Deut</i>., chap. 337.</i> which does not include “every woman shall ask of her neighbor and of her that sojourneth in her house,”<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">128. Exod. 3:22.</i> and “And they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold … and raiment … and they despoiled the Egyptians.”<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">129. Exod. 12:35–36.</i> Altogether, the servitude and affliction were the essential cause of the success of our forefathers in improving body and soul, the ultimate (goal).<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">130. This paraphrases the <i>Guide</i> III:27, which states: “the law as a whole aims at two things: the welfare of the soul and the welfare of the body.” Kaspi expands upon this in <i>Sefer Ha-Musar</i> (AS II 61, <i>Ethical Wills</i> p. 133).</i> This is to be compared to those at sea en route to their destination, who are led to another destination against their will by a storm brought by the Lord, only to profit many times more (than originally planned), or to profit instead of losing their lives and money had they reached their intended destination. This is a constant occurrence on land and sea. The same is true of our people (in Egypt) in their success (in improving their body and soul). The enslavement of Joseph after he was sold and imprisoned and tied (hand) and foot was similar. The whole matter is to be compared to a sick man who is fed “sangvin”<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">131. In the Parma MS of <i>Ḳevuṣat Kesef</i>, Kaspi refers to this potion as a medicine compounded of honey and vinegar. References to this medicine are found in Averroës’ <i>Epitome of Aristotle’s Physics</i> (Riva di Trento, 1559) and Maimonides’ <i>Be’ur Ha-Shemot Ha-Refu’ot</i>, ed. S. Muntner (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1969), p. 114, where in a responsum it is advocated to take a solution of vinegar and honey, about an hour after a meal, to assist the digestive process. The editor translates the term as “oxymel.”</i> (which is a bitter potion) causing him to recuperate and stay alive, only to die later when he is fed honey.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">132. The point here is that the bitter vinegar is an active agent that effects the recovery.</i> The sages compare this to one whose organ was severed in wartime by an enemy, resulting in a loss of blood that saved his life, for (all along) he had been in need of bloodletting to prevent his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">133. Bloodletting is discussed in BT <i>Shabbat</i> 129a. In Maimonides’ <i>Be’ur Ha-Shemot Ha-Refu’ot</i>, p. 143, he states: “[bloodletting] cleanses the blood and adjusts the liver, to facilitate the production of healthier blood.”</i> Why should I continue at length in a matter which even babes know?<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">134. The idea of suffering as a discipline and as a didactic tool has a long history in Biblical thought. The “suffering servant of the Lord” is first found in Isaiah, and also is found in the Book of Job, in the speeches of Eliphaz and Elihu (Job 5:17, 33:16–30, 36:9–12). For further discussion of this point, see R. Gordis, “Elihu the Intruder,” in <i>Biblical and Other Studies</i>, ed. A. Altmann (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963), p. 74.</i>
“But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace” poses no question,<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">135. The question that might be considered is that according to the above, both that which precedes the word “but” and that which follows are good tidings. Consequently it would have made better sense to use the conjunctive “and.”</i> for “peace” fluctuates by degrees, so that Abraham’s peace exceeded that of his seed, who were slaves. Notice this precision (of expression), for in truth this applies to affirmations regarding the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">136. He means that affirmations regarding God fluctuate in their accuracy and literal meaning.</i>
“And afterward they shall come out with great substance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">137. V. 14.</i> The acquisition of worldly possessions is an evil (when evaluated in light of) the highest truths. In the final analysis one can only eat food and wear clothing, yet who could explain this to the masses of our people?<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">138. This theme, repeated throughout Kaspi’s writings, is especially notable in view of his relative wealth (see above p. 9). His attitude is best illustrated in his commentary to Ecclesiastes (AS I 186), where he explains that the entire Book of Ecclesiastes is “to verify one teaching, and that is that man’s endeavors in this-worldly affairs are vain and empty …” See also MK I 58; AK I 85; AS I 15, 103; SK 30.</i> Isaiah expresses this when he says, “O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of Asshur, though he smite thee with the rod and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">139. Isa. 10:24.</i> | This phrase, “after the manner of Egypt,” was meant to inform them that the news of Egypt’s affliction of our people was good news, not news of suffering and castigation. Isaiah used to say this to the people of Zion, where the words “be not afraid …” were not in reference to the rod (he did not deny that they would be smitten), but that the smiting would not be an evil thing. Whatever I have said is to be found in the wise saying, “You shall not achieve that for which you yearn, without first enduring that which you despise.”<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">140. <i>Mivḥar Ha-Peninim</i>, attributed to Ibn Gabirol, trans. by B. H. Asher (London, 1895), II:19.</i> In this world this is similar to “Thou shalt not eat its honey except that it be mixed with poison.”<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">141. Similarly in <i>Muserei Ha-Philosophim</i>, attributed to Ḥonein b. Iṣḥak Ha-Noṣri, ed. Leventhal (Frankfurt, 1896), p. 19: “How much a man rejoices in what makes him sick, but fears that which is his cure.”</i> This is the meaning of “but thou shall go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age,” where the death and burial themselves are not good news, but only necessary, whereas the good news was that this would happen in peace and in a good old age. Certainly the promise mentioned to Abraham earlier was likewise, in saying “and they shall afflict them … and afterward they shall come out …”
In the case of the news and the blessing, “Behold, thou art with child, and thou shall bear a son,” that were told to Hagar,<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">142. Gen. 16:11.</i> (her conceiving is mentioned) because the conception and birth necessarily precede the existence of the child, thus those evils (must precede) the benefits and the blessing. (This is also stated explicitly) in the curse of Eve, beginning “and unto the woman He said …”<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">143. Gen. 3:16.</i>
(In conclusion) it was necessary that these ideas precede, both in time and causal relation, their exodus “with great substance.” Otherwise they would have left poor and without property, or at most with very few possessions. Note carefully that on both occasions when the Lord promised that Sarah would have a child, He does not mention the conception and birth, as was done with Hagar, but instead is careful to mention only the existence of the child, that which is the blessing.

Chapter 10

This (chapter) will explain<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. In commenting on this chapter of Genesis in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 53), Kaspi says, “the explanation of this vision will be found in the <i>Gevia‘</i>.”</i> the second vision of Abraham, which begins: “And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto him, ‘I am God Almighty; walk before me and be thou whole-hearted.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Gen. 17:1.</i> I have already discussed the name “God” (<i>’El</i>), and the name “Almighty” (<i>Shaddai</i>) in many places, where I have pointed out that (the Torah) ascribes these weak names to the Lord, in the context of the command to be fruitful and multiply,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 53). In that work (MK II 143) Kaspi explains that <i>Shaddai</i> is superior to <i>’El</i>. Kaspi’s explanation of the names of God is discussed above in Chapter 3. On the name <i>Shaddai</i>, see above chap. IV, n. 13.</i> both here and in the context of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Gen. 32:11.</i> For this reason this (verse) does not use “I am the Lord …” (At the same time) I do not insist that this (explanation of that name) is certain and necessary, for it is not (necessarily) acceptable to everyone. I do say, however, that this explanation is the best and most exact, in accordance with Maimonides’ fifth cause of contradiction, i.e., substitution and change.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. The <i>Guide</i>, Introduction. The use of this method of contradictions in Kaspi’s exegesis is discussed above pp. 42–43.</i>
I have already explained “Walk before me and be thou whole-hearted.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. In chap. II, p. 139 Kaspi explained that the <i>hitpa‘el</i> stem connotes an ongoing, incomplete action. In the present verse, the word <i>hit’halekh</i> (“walk”) is used.</i> There is no question why these words that imply weakness are used in reference to Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. According to the previous note, Abraham is told by God to continue to develop his “wholeheartedness”—an implication that Abraham was still incomplete.</i> for in spite of Abraham’s previous attainment of complete wholeness and perfection of prophecy, | there will occur some weakness at the time of a later prophetic vision, as Maimonides revealed in his book in the chapters dealing with prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. <i>Guide</i> II:45.</i>
“And Abram fell on his face.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. V. 3.</i> Even though this did not take place at the outset of the prophecy, as occurred in the earlier prophecy of the Sundering of the pieces, what happened here is in accordance with Maimonides’ statement that “afterward that trembling becomes greater.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. <i>Guide</i> II:41; he means that as the vision progresses and becomes more intense, the prophet is bereft of his strength.</i>
The statement (of the Lord) in this vision goes beyond the preceding (promises from God that Abraham would have) seed and be multiplied, and (beyond the promise) that Abraham, i.e., his descendants, would inherit the land. What He added to all of this was that He would be their God. This would be the finest facet of the covenant made with Abraham in the vision of the Sundering. (This fact) that those among his descendants who would be complete would achieve this (closeness to God) was not mentioned there.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Nachmanides, in commenting on Gen. 15:28, explains that what was new in this promise is that for the first time the boundaries of the promised land are delineated, and Abraham is assured that no future sins will stand in the way of the promise.</i>
“And as for thee, thou shall keep my covenant.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. V. 9.</i> These words explain that the term “covenant,” which was used in the vision of the covenant, could be used as an equivocal term having three meanings: the first was in reference to the covenant of inheritance, as mentioned in the vision of the Sundering; the second refers to (the promise) “to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee”; and the third is in reference to the covenant of the circumcision. In the same way it is always proper to divide a general term, whether it be an equivocal term or a conventional term, into its parts.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. The importance of the distinction between genus and species has been discussed above, pp. 48–49.</i> The covenant of circumcision has a similar function to that of the covenants mentioned earlier, (even though this was not stated explicitly, for) it was not appropriate to say in that connection, “it shall be a token of a covenant,” or “it shall be a sign.”
“And God said unto Abraham: ‘As for Sarai thy wife …’”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. V. 15.</i> Whoever wishes to explain prophecy should compare it to speculative matters,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Cf. <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 86), which explains that “the intellect and prophecy are both faculties of the soul.”</i> and that in turn to practical matters,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 105) Kaspi says that Moses illustrated the secrets of the universe graphically, through the use of the Temple-plan, for “all the prophets … used such (aids) … so that those who saw them would understand …”</i> for then he will understand. Now it is clear from all these matters, that what comes later is superior. Accordingly, in the present vision, Abraham perceived during the initial period of seclusion that he would have descendants, that the Lord would be his God, and that his descendants would be circumcised—but it was not clear to him from which woman (he would have those children). This is only apprehended at this subsequent stage, as is always the case with the prophets. This was how it was at the vision of the Sundering (as well). (At a later stage) there is either some further explanation of what had preceded earlier or else some new insight. In the present instance, what was new and additional was the news that he would have a child from Sarah.
“And said in his heart, ‘shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old, and shall Sarah …’”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. V. 17.</i> As for these words, I have already explained the phrase “in his heart” in connection with “and it grieved Him at His heart”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Gen. 6:6.</i> and “And the Lord said in His heart,”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Gen. 8:21.</i> in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 34) Kaspi invokes the principle that “the Torah speaks in the language of men” in regard to these verses. On this principle, see above Chapter 2.</i> Here the implication is that Abraham did not want the Lord or anyone else to hear him, teaching us that it is not correct to doubt the king’s words at all. The writer of the Torah recorded this for us so that we should understand | what I have explained here. The masses should certainly not feel that Abraham was in doubt. (Instead they should feel that “in his heart”) has the same meaning as when it is used with Eliezer<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. Gen. 24:45, “… and before I had done speaking to my heart …”</i> and Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. Gen. 27:41, “… and Esau said in his heart: ‘Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand …’” In this and the previous note, the phrase means, “he thought to himself.”</i> The reason for his speaking “in his heart” was that it was not right that his contemporaries should think that Abraham was in doubt or uncertain of the promise of the Lord, or uncertain of his ability to understand God’s word in spite of his being so great a prophet.
Now the purpose of this statement, and what it implies, was that the Lord told him of the decree that he would father a son of Sarah that would become a nation. This was a special decree of a future event that was to be like the rising of tomorrow’s sun, or tomorrow’s rainfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. He means that it was not clear whether the realization of the promise was conditional upon other factors.</i> This was something that Abraham did not understand.
<i>Yiṣḥak</i> poses no question,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. The question that is implied by the name is that, according to the above, Abraham was not incredulous, but merely did not understand the promise fully, yet this name implies that Abraham mocked at the idea of Sarah giving birth.</i> for it is known that <i>yiṣḥak</i> is equivocal, referring either to a mocking that conveys an intent that is evil or corrupt, or to a (benign) mixture of joy, introspection, and incredulity. In the present context one meaning is intended, while in the next chapter, regarding Sarah, the other occurs.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. Cf. Gen. 18:12. This distinction is similar to the one made by Onkelos, who translates the present “laughter” as <i>ve-ḥadei</i>, which implies “happiness,” as opposed to <i>heikhat</i>, which implies “mockery,” in the case of Sarah.</i>
“Oh that Ishmael might live before thee.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. V. 18.</i> Such words are not appropriate for a man such as Abraham, for by uttering them he attributed deception or exaggeration to God. God had told him that Sarah would give birth, and this answer—“Oh that Ishmael might live before thee”—was as if he said, “(You must be referring to) this son, for otherwise this is impossible and cannot happen.” The answer to all this is that this entire passage displays remarkable wisdom, and can be attested to by those knowing logic. Abraham said to the Lord, “Regarding what you mentioned earlier in the vision—i.e., ‘I will make thee exceeding fruitful … and I will establish my covenant … and I will give unto thy seed the land of thy sojournings …’—clearly these things are as necessary as tomorrow’s sunrise, for all of this explains the earlier vision of the Sundering, which spoke of the covenant. This, however, could all apply equally to Ishmael, who is already born.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 89) Kaspi explains otherwise, saying that Abraham doubted the possibility of Sarah’s conceiving, in the same way that Moses asked, “If flocks and herds be slain for them, will they suffice them?” (Num. 11:22).</i> All this is meant by the words “Oh that Ishmael might live before thee,” which assert that it might be Ishmael who would be fruitful and have children who would inherit the land of Canaan. (In other words) he is saying, “God, in your words there are two mysteries that I do not understand. In either case what you have said is correct, for it is impossible for you to lie, for ‘God is not man that He should lie.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. Num. 23:19.</i> This is the meaning of Abraham’s words, in the same sense as his saying, “Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old?”
Accordingly, “Oh that Ishmael …” should not be taken in the sense that stumbling women would speak, neither according to the ways of effeminate men. It is certain that when Moses wrote this scroll and express statement, which is the Torah and its narratives, (he did not intend to imply such doubts).
The Lord then answers him, resolving both the first and second doubts in their proper order. He said to him: “Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shall call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed | after him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. V. 19.</i> The meaning of this statement of God the teacher to Abraham His student is, “Regarding your doubt whether the decree that you will have a son from Sarah is necessary or contingent, know that it is necessary, even though there is no mention of a covenant or an oath in that context.” This is the meaning of His word “nay,” which is similar to “Nay, for we are guilty,”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. Gen. 42:21. The JPS trans. is, “We are verily guilty.”</i> or wherever “nay” constitutes the first word of a sentence. Similarly it is said in the prayers, “Nay, we have sinned,”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. This is in reference to the confessional prayers on the Day of Atonement, which have the term <i>’anaḥnu</i> (“We”).</i> which is similar to “Moreover she is my sister,”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. Gen. 20:12.</i> where the meaning is “in truth (we have sinned).” This is in accordance with Maimonides’ definition of truth as he explained in (the <i>Guide</i>) I:50,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. There Maimonides differentiates between the states of belief and certainty as follows: “Belief is the affirmation that what has been presented is outside the mind just as it has been represented in the mind. If together with this belief one realizes that a belief different from it is in no way possible, and that no starting point be found in the mind for a rejection of this belief, or for a supposition that a different belief is possible, there is certainty.” Kaspi repeats this definition in AS I 36.</i> and in accordance with the books of the philosophers.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. Cf. chap. V, n. 1.</i> Thus, with this separate word “nay,” the Lord informed Abraham that the decree “and moreover I will give thee a son of her” was for a necessary future event. The Lord told him, “While it is true that you are in doubt, and you have said that the future decrees mentioned above, including the vision of the Sundering, while true might refer to Ishmael—nonetheless know that the decrees are such that they refer to Isaac, who will be born of Sarah. And if there be a decree included in the above that does refer to both Isaac and Ishmael, and that says ‘I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations out of thee and kings will come out of thee,’ nonetheless the decree saying ‘I will establish my covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee,’ which follows, refers exclusively to Isaac.” This is the meaning of the words “I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him,” which are spoken at this point, as well as the meaning of “As for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, I have blessed him, and I will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. V. 20.</i> By way of further clarification of the above-mentioned covenant as described in the vision of the Sundering, God reaffirms that “my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee.” The meaning of this statement is, “As for Ishmael, while I referred to him earlier when I said you would be multiplied—I was not referring to him at all when I said that I would establish my covenant (between me and thee and thy seed after thee); indeed I have not made any covenant with you that could refer to Ishmael.” At the close of the (prophetic) seclusion the Lord informs Abraham that in addition (Isaac will be born) “at this set time in the next year,” (for the conclusion of a vision) is the most auspicious.
There is another great and remarkable observation. In several places I have written that the giver of the Torah, as well as those who established the Hebrew language in general, agreed to the usage whereby the past tense (of a verb) could be used to refer to the future, and vice versa.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 36) Kaspi explains that the words “I have set my bow in the cloud” (Gen. 9:13) refer simultaneously to the past and the future, for “the daily sphere has circled continuously since the creation of the world, therefore all future is necessarily described as the past, for these two tenses only have reference to the present.” Elsewhere (MK II 64, 104) he explains this usage as due to the fact that “the future is potentially the past, certainly when the future is close to being realized.” This point, alluded to later in the <i>Gevia’ Kesef</i> (chap. XVIII), is the esoteric doctrine referred to here, being that change is the actualization of potentiality. See Aristotle, <i>Physics</i> I, 7. This in effect blurs the distinction between past and future, permitting Kaspi to explain here that future and past are interchangeable. This is discussed above pp. 49–51.</i> As I explained, this is correct for several reasons, each instance depending on its particular signification and literal meaning. This method was one of the effective techniques used by the writer of the Torah to conceal esoteric doctrine, (using terms) that are in doubt or subject to interpretation, | which are a form of equivocation. Two such places are here, for the words <i>natati mimenah lekha ben</i> (lit. “I have given you a son of her”) refer exclusively to the future, as up to that point this had not been done, even in an esoteric sense. On the other hand, <i>beirakhti ’oto ve-hifreiti ’oto</i> (“I have blessed him and made him fruitful”) refers exclusively to the past, for earlier the Lord had said, <i>“ve-hifreiti ’otekha bi-me’od me’od</i> (“I will multiply thee exceedingly”),<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. V. 2. Kimḥi explained that Ishmael was blessed earlier when the angel appeared to Hagar (Gen. 16:10).</i> which is an explicit utterance (of blessing being given).
The phrase “As for Ishmael, I have heard thee” does not pose a problem by implying that Abraham had uttered a new prayer in the words “Oh that Ishmael might live before thee.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. He means that God’s words here might be taken to be providing a new blessing for Ishmael, in response to a new request that had been made by Abraham.</i> For the expression is equivocal, intentionally written in this attractive way by the writer of the Torah so that its exoteric sense be understood (as a new prayer).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. In the <i>Guide</i>, Introduction, Maimonides describes the second kind of parable as having many words, “not every one of which adds something to the intended meaning. They serve rather to embellish the parable and render it more coherent, or to conceal further the intended meaning …” Here Kaspi says that the details are both for coherence and concealment.</i> According to this exoteric explanation, the meaning of the verse, when God says “I will bless him and make him fruitful,” refers exclusively to the future (as blessings promised for the future in response to Abraham’s new prayer), as an event that will exist in the future. This will be either on account of its being presently spoken (as a blessing for the future) or because right now it is in potential. My own (preferred) explanation, however, is in accordance with the esoteric meaning and with precise philosophic insight. Both explanations here possess truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">40. He means that the esoteric meaning does not negate the exoteric or literal meaning. Kaspi’s attitude to the two levels of exegesis, the exoteric and the esoteric, is discussed at length in Chapter 2.</i> This is true of the entire Torah, in that every term and statement possesses a meaning within a meaning, both of which are true. It is similar in every science, in every means of expression and artistry, or artistic instrument.
“And He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">41. V. 22.</i> These words are similar to “The Lord went His way as soon as He had left off speaking with Abraham,”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">42. Gen. 18:33.</i> as well as “and God went up from him,”<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">43. Gen. 35:13.</i> said of Jacob. Undoubtedly it is always like this, but it is not always necessary that it be so written. In any case the meaning is clearly that it is God who removes Himself from the person. Maimonides explained the equivocal nature of <i>‘alah</i> (“ascend”) and <i>halakh</i> (“went”) to allude to this.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">44. <i>Guide</i> I:10 says: <i>“‘Alah</i> is the opposite of prophetic inspiration and its ennobling.”</i> All of this is by way of “the Torah speaks in the language of men,”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">45. BT <i>Bava’ Meṣi‘a’</i> 31b. This doctrine is discussed in Chapter 2.</i> for kings depart from servants at will, not the other way around, for a servant lacks sufficient power to hold a king back. If a servant does have any power in such matters, it is only as when Jacob said, “Let me go.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">46. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 90) this verse is explained as being necessary to indicate that the vision ended at this point, so that the circumcision that followed was not merely in a vision, but was carried out while fully awake. This is consistent with his comments below in chap. XIII, pp. 216–217.</i> These matters are all very profound, to be understood by those who know the true nature of prophecy as explained by Maimonides in the <i>Guide</i> II:36, as well as (the true nature of) the rational, speculative faculty.

Chapter 11

The masses or those who dabble in philosophy<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. In the <i>Sefer Ha-Musar</i> (AS II 67; <i>Ethical Wills</i>, p. 146), Kaspi explains who these dabblers are: “They are destroyers and rebels; they scoff at the words of the rabbis of blessed memory, treat the practical precepts as of little account, and accept unseemly interpretations of biblical narratives …” Kaspi implies there that they deny the validity of practical laws as expounded by the sages. Consequently, in the present context he is saying that both the masses and the would-be philosophers accept the prevalent opinion that the oral tradition places its priority on the practical precepts, but that whereas the former practice those precepts, the latter scoff at them. Averroës appears to identify the would-be philosophers of contemporary Islam with the Kalamists, who confuse the masses and open the road to heresy. See A. Halkin, “Yedaiah Bedershi’s Apology,” in <i>Medieval and Renaissance Studies</i>, ed. A. Altmann (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967), p. 173, n. 48.</i> think that when Moses handed the commentary of his book to Joshua, (and when that was given) by Joshua to the elders, and by the elders to the prophets, and by the prophets to the Men of the Great Assembly, the most important part (of the commentary) began only | at “Ye shall dwell in booths seven days,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Lev. 23:42. Kaspi chooses the same commandment as the archetype of the practical precepts in <i>Sefer Ha-Musar</i> (AS II 70).</i> and other similar practical commandments. Some think, perhaps, that such (a commentary) was only formulated with regard to these (practical) commandments. Far be this from the truth, for (that part of the commentary) was minor, while the major portion, and the most important, pertained to the speculative commandments of the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. On this issue, see his remarks earlier in chap. VIII, above p. 171.</i> and to the anecdotes that make up the Book of Genesis, and which are, in fact, in explanation of (the speculative commandments).
For this reason, the explanations that I have mentioned in regard to these two visions, as well as similar matters derived from speculative philosophy, and subsequently those derived from practical philosophy,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Later, in chap. XIII, below p. 206, Kaspi discusses the nature and significance of practical philosophy.</i> are, in fact, the things that Moses taught as the essential, and primarily intended, subject-matter. This was the case with those that followed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. He means that the development of the oral tradition continued to recognize the centrality of the commandments of the heart. Cf. below chap. XIX, which is devoted to a discussion of the relative merits of anecdote and law in the Torah.</i>

Chapter 12

Know that in the Torah, when any prophet expresses a thought that implies some question or uncertainty, it does not mean that that prophet doubts the word of the Lord, or considers the possibility that His word, whether great or small, could be voided. (The reason is that a prophet knows that) “there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. II Kings 10:10.</i> When such statements are spoken by the prophets, as when Abraham said, “Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Gen. 17:17.</i> and “Wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked”;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Gen. 18:23.</i> or when Jacob said, “Thou saidest, ‘I will surely do thee good’”;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Gen. 32:13.</i> or when Moses uttered several statements of this kind—all these are spoken in the fullest faith that the word of the Lord will neither fail nor deceive. These statements come instead by way of investigative query, inasmuch as the word of the Lord can be interpreted in various ways. The student, i.e., the prophet, requests clarification of whether (the Lord’s) intention is to (all) the interpretations or some of them, and if to some of them, how many and which ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. He means that God’s words can be interpreted in several ways, and it is not always immediately clear to the prophet which interpretation is correct.</i> Regarding this variety of interpretations, there are many things to consider. The most important, those that override the others, are two: are there terms or phrases which are equivocal; and, what is the mode of expression? (The latter factor occurs) when (it is not clear whether the expression) is contingent or necessary, because it lacks a qualifying phrase.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. In the <i>Shulḥan Kesef</i>, fol. 182a, Kaspi says: Examples of statements that are without qualifying phrases are “man lives,” “man writes,” while examples of statements with qualifying phrases are “man lives necessarily,” “man writes possibly.”</i> An example of a contingent statement (that is unclear) is, “It may be that I shall be builded up through her.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. In the same passage of <i>Shulḥan Kesef</i>, Kaspi appears to say that this verse is an example of a statement that possesses a qualifying phrase, for “it may be” is the equivalent of “possibly.” That explanation appears more accurate than the present one.</i> An example of a necessary statement (that is similary unclear) because it lacks a qualifying phrase, is, “I will give thee a son of her.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. He means that in the original Hebrew the term <i>natati</i> (“I will give”) could mean “I will possibly give.”</i> Statements having qualifying phrases include “Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. V. 19.</i> which (indicates) a covenantal obligation or an expression of an oath. Nowhere in the Torah is there an expression that has qualifying phrases unless such a phrase conforms to these (two) formulations. Even the pronouncements of Isaiah on the destruction of Edom<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Isa. 34.</i> are not really necessary expressions—certainly none of the others (that prophesy destruction).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. This, as well as the entire paragraph, is in accordance with Kaspi’s assertion (against Maimonides) that divine decrees never change—they are only reinterpreted in the light of subsequent events. Accordingly the pronouncement of a divine decree, while it may appear to foretell a necessary event, in most cases foretells a contingent event. The only exceptions, Kaspi says here, are pronouncements that include an oath or a covenant. See <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 286) and <i>Shulḥan Kesef</i>, fols. 182a ff., for a fuller treatment of this doctrine.</i>
The general rule here is that both | the fool and the wise raise questions, but that while the fool asks in order to make fun, a wise person will inquire out of consideration of the principles of science. This is meant by “it is not out of wisdom that thou inquirest concerning this,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Eccles. 7:10.</i> for indeed (Ecclesiastes) asks precisely that question<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. The question asked is: “How was it possible that the former days were better than these?” (Eccles. 7:10).</i> —however, it is from such considerations that he attained wisdom, for he inquired in investigation of that detail in a manner that a fool would not even ask regarding general principles. (Similarly) Aristotle said that one only knows something by comprehending it from both points of view, as is recorded in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. In the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> II, 1, 89b, Aristotle says: “thus when our question concerns a complex of things and attributes, and we ask whether a thing is thus or otherwise qualified, whether, for example, the sun suffers an eclipse or not, then we are asking as to the facts of the connection.… on the other hand, when we know the fact we ask the reason; as, for example, when we know that the sun is being eclipsed, and that an earthquake is in progress, it is regarding the reason of the eclipse or earthquake that we inquire.”</i>

Chapter 13

This (chapter) explains the third version of Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. In the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 54) Kaspi says of this vision, “The person who has the <i>Gevia‘</i> in his hand will know the intent of this narrative.”</i> which begins, “And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Gen. 18:1.</i> Maimonides in the <i>Guide</i> II:36 wrote something in this manner: “It is known that a matter that occupies a man greatly—he being bent upon it and desirous of it—while he is awake and while his senses function, is that with regard to which the imaginative faculty acts while he is asleep …”
This is proven by the dreams of every person,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Cf. BT <i>Berakhot</i> 55a: “a person sees in his dreams what his heart thinks about.” Aristotle (<i>On Dreams</i> 3, 460b) says: “… stimulatory movements, based upon sensory impressions, whether the latter are derived from external objects or from within the body, present themselves not only when the person is awake, but also when this affection which is called sleep has come upon them, with even greater impressiveness …” Averroës expands on this in the <i>Epitome of the Parva Naturalia</i>, ed. H. Blumberg (Cambridge: Mediaeval Academy of America, 1954), p. 45, saying that if one who sleeps feels as if he sees or hears, such a feeling has its beginning in the awakened state. But because the faculties of thought and memory do not function during sleep, the imaginative faculty can govern the soul unimpeded. The result is the distorted images of dreams. Such dreams cannot clarify rational truths, but occasionally do portend future events. This is reflected by Kaspi’s saying that the dream contained no rational truths, but only a future event, i.e., the birth of Isaac. (In the <i>‘Ammudei Kesef</i> (AM 117), Kaspi states that according to Averroës, prophecy always occurs when awake. This is not born out by our editions of the <i>Epitome</i>.) This presence of the imaginative faculty in prophetic dreams is used by Kaspi to solve another problem: the interpretation of such dreams likewise requires the active participation of the imaginative faculty of the interpreter. That faculty is aroused by a detailed description of the images in the original dream, thereby enabling the interpreter to reconstruct the “message” of the dream. In this way Kaspi explains (<i>Ṭirat Kesef</i>, MK I 124) the need for the Torah to repeat the many details of Pharaoh’s dream as recounted to Joseph. This solution, as offered by Kaspi, is likewise based upon Averroës’ <i>Epitome</i>, p. 52, where the whole process is compared to the physician’s diagnosis, which relies heavily on a complete description by the patient of the perceived symptoms experienced. For a similar analogy borrowed from Averroës, see above in Chapter 4, p. 120. It should also be noted that the <i>Commentary of Samuel ben Hofni Gaon on the Torah</i>, ed. by Aaron Greenbaum (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1978), p. 112, also says in the context of Pharaoh’s dream that “it is necessary for the interpreter of a dream to be very precise with the words of the dreamer in examining the dream … as is the case with a physician as well.” As this commentary was written at the end of the tenth century, it obviously antedates Averroës’ words quoted earlier, even though Greenbaum’s formulation appears to identify Averroës as Samuel ben Ḥofni’s source (cf. his n. 55 passim).</i> as, for example, when fools experience a nocturnal emission, and the wise experience the speculative sciences or future events, whether literally or metaphorically. On occasion the metaphor will be concerning practical philosophy, as was the case here with Abraham, for generous hospitality toward guests that are good and honorable is a principle of practical philosophy.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. In the <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i> VI, 5, 1140b, Aristotle defines practical philosophy as “a reasoned and true state of capacity to act with regard to human goods.”</i> Such was his manner when awake, and it was in that form that Abraham saw the vision in comprehending the configuration of the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Cf. above n. 3.</i> In my opinion this parable belongs to the second category enumerated by Maimonides,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Cf. above chap. X, n. 39.</i> may his memory be blessed, for significance is to be found only in the general outline of the parable, with the details that are present being for aesthetic reasons, and not to conceal the hidden meaning.
At the outset the giver of the Torah mentions the general location and the specific place,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 72) he explains that place can be either inclusive (<i>kolel</i>) or exclusive (<i>meyuḥad</i>), and such terms fluctuate by degree.</i> where “the terebinths of Mamre” is the general place-name. This teaches us that a location is instrumental, in that (it provides) the circumstantial factors. This is certainly true of the specific place when added to the position of the person in relation to that place. In the present case he is seated (<i>yoshev</i>), in the manner of all who are composed (<i>meyushav ha-da‘at</i>) in the act of speculative withdrawal, as opposed to one who is standing and moving around.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. Cf. below chap. XVII, which explains that any movement would have rendered Abraham incapable of contemplation, whether rational or prophetic.</i> This is also implied by his being in the tent, separated from people.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. He means to say that Abraham would have been distracted by company.</i>
“Door”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. In Heb. <i>petaḥ ha-’ohel</i>, lit. “the opening of the tent.”</i> is necessarily stated for two reasons. The first is required for the following “appeared unto him … and lo, three men”; the other is to teach us that his wife was not there with him, but she was within. By being at the door of the tent, he combined a dual separation, both from his wife and from his contemporaries,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. This phrase reflects Kaspi’s own attitudes to his contemporaries, especially the masses to be found in the street. For more discussion of this aspect of Kaspi’s life, see Chapter 1.</i> (both of which) prevent the achievement of everything good by one who frequents their company.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. This disparaging remark includes wives. In AS I 17 he refers to erring wives who distract their husbands from prayer and contemplation of spiritual themes.</i>
“In the heat of the day” specifies the time as that time when one separates from people, as each one stays in his tent on account of the heat, as it was evidently the summertime. | This is proven by “He took curd and milk and the calf.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. Kaspi apparently has in mind the general practice among farmers breeding cattle to prefer the late spring as the best calving season, for a variety of reasons. The term “calf” usually applies only to the first several months after birth, and therefore any reference to “calf,” as in the present verse, would in all likelihood occur in the summertime.</i>
Abraham, however, was not asleep, for this was a vision and not a dream.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. This appears to contradict his statement in chap. XVII, below, p. 248 that Abraham was indeed sleeping, “for sleep is a necessity for prophets.” The contradiction is resolved by keeping in mind the <i>Guide</i> II:45, which states: “every vision in which you find the prophet hearing speech was in its beginning a vision, but ended in a state of submersion [i.e., sleep] and became a dream … all speech that is heard is heard only in a dream.” Consequently, Abraham was awake initially, in experiencing a vision, but later he fell asleep and had his prophetic dream.</i> This has already been explained by Maimonides.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. <i>Guide</i> II:41.</i> In the case of Lot, however, because it was a dream, the event occurred at night (when he was asleep).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. The events recounted in Gen. 19:1 started out as a dream.</i>
“And he looked, and behold, three men stood over against him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. V. 2.</i> This is true in my opinion,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. He means that Abraham responded that way in his vision to the three men who appeared to him.</i> for from that point until “and they did eat”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. V. 8.</i> contains nothing but the parable, whose general meaning accords with what I have already said, in that it relates Abraham’s wholeness in matters of practical philosophy,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Kimḥi says that “this entire story was written to teach us how to relate to people with righteousness and kindness, for it is an act of kindness to bring people into one’s house and to fulfill all their needs.”</i> which in turn is a stepping-stone to theoretical philosophy.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. He means that proficiency in practical philosophy must precede the intellectual virtues.</i> It was proper that here too there are some matters regarding theoretical principles.
For this reason it says that these three men “stood over against him,” for as Maimonides said in the <i>Guide</i> II:36, “Know that the true reality and quidity of prophecy consists in its being an overflow overflowing from God … through the intermediation of the Active Intellect toward the rational faculty in the first place and thereafter toward the imaginative faculty.” Therefore these three men, personages, or individuals were (an allusion to) these three existents, i.e., the Active Intellect, the rational faculty, and the imaginative faculty. (These three were present) in the case of every prophet, with the exception of Moses our teacher, who had but two, their agnomen being the two cherubim,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. Exod. 25:22 states: “I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony.” In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 109), Kaspi says otherwise, that the cherubim refer to the two upper worlds that dominate the third, lowest world.</i> i.e., the Active Intellect and the rational faculty.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. In commenting on the <i>Guide</i> II:45 (AM 121) Kaspi adds that Moses’ rational faculty was an “emanated intellect.”</i> The lesser prophets possessed but two faculties: the rational and the imaginative. This is the meaning of “And the two angels came to Sodom,”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. Gen. 19:1, in reference to their visit to Lot.</i> for in the case of Lot only these came, as the Active Intellect did not overflow onto his rational faculty.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. In the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 56) he adds that “even the two that did appear were not the two that are represented by the two cherubim … these are important matters, all being found in the <i>Gevia‘</i>.” The implication is that Moses’ prophetic faculties were categorically different from those of any other prophet. For further discussion of Kaspi’s attitudes to prophecy, notably that of Moses, see Mesch, <i>Studies</i>, pp. 80–106.</i>
“And when he saw them he ran to meet them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. V. 2.</i> (This teaches that) it is necessary for one to pursue after (the attainment of prophecy) by means of prophetic or speculative seclusion, and then to be subservient to (that goal). This is (the meaning of) “and bowed down to the earth.”
“My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. V. 3.</i> The sages, may their memory be blessed, revealed that “Abraham addressed their leader,”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 48, in noticing that Abraham uses the singular.</i> for even though in any language it would be correct not to be so precise, yet it is appropriate to use precision in these profound matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. These words, indeed the entire passage, should be contrasted with Kaspi’s words in <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 91–92) saying that this story teaches but one basic idea—the pleasurable nature of intellectual attachment. Consequently, he asserts that “one should not inquire as to details of the story, for they all follow from his initial imagining of the three men…. For this reason I am surprised that Maimonides says that there is a great secret here …” From the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i> here it is clear that Kaspi finds such esoteric doctrines through the careful analysis of the Scriptural text. On the significance of this passage for the general problem of Kaspi’s attitude to precise observation in Scripture, see above p. 60. Certainly there is room for modification of the statement that “Kaspi is the extreme opponent of every precise observation … mocking every question of a superfluity or omission in Scripture,” which is found in N. Leibowitz, ‘ <i>Iyyunim Ḥadashim Be-Sefer Shemot</i> (Jerusalem: World Zionist Organization, 1969), p. 66.</i> The intention here is to convey that Abraham persisted in his prophetic speculation, by holding on to the coattails of the Active Intellect to prevent it from passing away from him, as had previously occurred when “God went up from Abraham.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. Gen. 17:22.</i> I mean that he did not want the overflow to the rational faculty to cease.
The sages were also careful in saying, “They appeared (<i>nir’u</i>) to Abraham in the image of people, for Abraham’s faculty was superior, while for Lot they were in the image (<i>nidmu</i>) of angels, as Lot’s faculty was weak.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. Our editions of <i>Genesis Rabbah 50</i> have <i>nidmu</i> in both cases, and in <i>Tanḥuma’ Yashan</i> they are reversed, with Abraham <i>nidmu</i> and with Lot <i>nir’u</i>.</i> Regarding this statement, Maimonides said in the <i>Guide</i> II:45 that “this is a great prophetic secret,” and this statement caused a problem for those who dabble in philosophy,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. Cf. above chap. XI, n. 1.</i> for they found that in the <i>Guide</i> II:45 Maimonides wrote | that the sight of an angel (in a prophetic vision) indicates a level that is superior to a vision where a person is seen. If, however, I have read well, then these dabblers in philosophy are not philosophers.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. He means that they are not yet complete philosophers, for if they were, they would see that there is no contradiction.</i> The reason is that in that place Maimonides arranges the levels (of prophecy) so that they occur in a dream as far as the seventh level; from there he begins with visions, which are superior to dreams, as it is written, “Do I in a vision make myself known to him, I do speak with him in a dream.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. Num. 12:6.</i> These two postulated categories constitute superior prophetic states, and within each category Maimonides in that chapter arranges the disparate levels. Now within each category he undoubtedly asserts that to see an angel is to experience a higher level than to see a person. Abraham and Lot, however, were not within the same category according to the two categories mentioned. They were in two separate categories in this episode, for Abraham experienced a vision, while Lot experienced a dream. The vision is a superior faculty, while the dream is an inferior faculty. For this reason they said that in the case of Abraham, whose faculty was superior, the angels “appeared to him,” while in the case of Lot, whose faculty was inferior, they appeared to him in an image.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. Cf. above n. 31.</i> Consequently, it was within this category (of visions) that Abraham saw people, a most propitious event, being the tenth level according to the enumeration of Maimonides. In the case of Lot, the event was the lesser of the two, for when at the end of the dream he saw angels, it was the sixth level in Maimonides’ enumeration. In summary, this statement of the sages, may their memory be blessed, says only, “Abraham in his vision saw people, while Lot in his dream saw angels.” It makes no difference if we say “superior faculty, inferior faculty” or “in a vision, in a dream” or “they appeared, they were in the image, he saw.” It is only that people think that different terms possess different (meanings).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. Other commentators to the <i>Guide</i> attempted to deal with this problem as well. Narboni says that in <i>Guide</i> II:6 the reference is not to the levels of prophecy but to the way in which a prophet perceives his soul, whether as angelic or human. Of the two perceptions, the latter is superior. Shemtov repeats this answer, as does Gersonides in explaining why the men in the case of Abraham changed to angels with Lot. Kaspi’s answer here was taken up by Ibn Crescas in his commentary to the <i>Guide</i>. Cf. also AM 93.</i> At the binding of Isaac, it states that Abraham saw angels, which corresponded to the eleventh level enumerated by Maimonides.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. <i>Guide</i> II:45, i.e, one level above the one achieved here.</i>
“Let now a little water be fetched … and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and stay ye your heart.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. Vv. 4–5.</i> All this is explained in light of Maimonides’ comments, which illuminate our eyes, in accordance with what he wrote regarding the equivocal nature of <i>’akhal</i> (“eat”), as well as his allusion there to (drinking) water.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. <i>Guide</i> I:30. Kaspi means that even though it states that they ate and drank, it is certain that this is to be understood figuratively, for the entire event occurred in a vision, and later as a dream. The figurative meaning, according to Maimonides, is that they achieved “intellectual apprehension.”</i> It is similar with Solomon’s statement of the wise, “Come, eat of my bread, drink of the wine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">40. Prov. 9:5.</i>
Add to this that it is correct to use an expression of washing (in this verse), to connote the purification of thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">41. V. 4, “and wash your feet.”</i>
“The herd.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">42. V. 7.</i> This term is an allusion to keen observation (necessary for prophecy), as in “the priest shall not seek (<i>yevaḳer</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">43. Lev. 13:36. “Herd” in Hebrew is <i>baḳar</i>, having the same root as <i>yevaḳer</i>.</i>
“Curd and milk.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">44. V. 8.</i> These terms are always used by the prophets in reference to good things, such as “I have drunk my wine | with my milk.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">45. Cant. 5:1.</i> Moses described the good principle in general as “curd of kine and milk of sheep.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">46. Deut. 32:14.</i>
The fact that the verse does not say “and they drank” as it says “and they did eat” does not pose a problem, for it is not necessary (to say this).
“Under the tree.”<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">47. Vv. 4, 8.</i> There is no doubt that this was the tree of life, or one of “the other trees of the garden.”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">48. Gen. 2:9.</i> It is certainly not the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">49. This cryptic allusion is probably to an idea developed in <i>Mizraḳ Kesef</i>, Kaspi’s nonextant commentary on the opening chapters of Genesis. One possibility is offered by Kimḥi’s remarks to Gen. 2:17, which explain that the tree of knowledge of good and evil symbolized sexual knowledge, implied by the fact that Adam and Eve recognized their nakedness after eating thereof. Consequently Kaspi might be saying that sexual preparedness is not a precondition of the attainment of prophecy. Cf. above chap. IX, n. 124.</i>
In general, all this talk, with questions and answers, is correct, for it took place as words inwardly spoken,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">50. He means that these words were not mouthed, but were communicated in the framework of the prophetic vision.</i> all this being included under <i>dibbur</i> (“speaking”) and <i>’amirah</i> (“saying”), which are independent terms. Yet on account of the fact that the writer of the Torah recorded that “Sarah heard (words being spoken),”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">51. V. 10.</i> which in my opinion is to be taken literally, one must say that He who gave the Torah intended this to be understood (as affirming that their conversation) included outwardly spoken words, similar to one who speaks in his sleep while dreaming.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">52. This is Kaspi’s first answer to the problem raised by Nachmanides in commenting on Gen. 18:1; i.e., how, according to Maimonides, could Sarah overhear the conversation if the entire chapter is only a vision that affected Abraham’s internal senses exclusively? The present answer is that Abraham might have spoken the words as they occurred in the vision. Kimḥi gives the same answer here, saying that “the sounds of speaking” emanate from the prophet, as in Dan. 10:7, “And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; how-beit a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.”</i> There is no doubt that most prophecies of the prophets, with the exception of Moses, were just like this. So in my opinion Sarah heard Abraham speaking with the angel, but without knowing (or) seeing the angel. It would also appear that she possessed one of the lower aspects of prophecy mentioned by Maimonides, especially in this chapter, where she secludes herself upon seeing her husband conversing with the angels through question and answer.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">53. This is a second answer to the above-mentioned problem. It might be prompted by the fact that the first answer does not explain how she heard the angels themselves speaking, for Abraham must have only mouthed his own words.</i> It was on that lower level that she prophesied, in a manner similar to the prophecy of Saul when he met the group of prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">54. I Sam. 10:10, “… a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.” Similarly here, the mere proximity to a prophet can engender a similar state of prophecy.</i> (It was in this manner) that she heard the words of the angel when saying, “I will … return to thee when the season cometh around; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">55. V. 10. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 92) there is another, simpler solution to this problem: Sarah did not participate at all—Abraham only saw in his vision that she reacted in this way. Likewise he explains that it was only in his imagination (<i>nafal be-dimyono</i>) that they ate and rose up.</i>
“Now Sarah and Abraham were old, and well stricken with age, and it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">56. V. 11.</i> These words are not part of the vision, but they are written by the writer of the vision to preface what follows,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">57. Kimḥi likewise says that the verse explains why Sarah laughed.</i> so that this fact be understood by those who receive and constantly study the Torah. This is like “And Sarai was barren”;<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">58. Gen. 11:30.</i> “And Joseph was of beautiful form and fair to look on.”<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">59. Gen. 39:6.</i> This is to be compared to one who says something in order to inform his fellow.
“And Sarah laughed within herself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">60. V. 12.</i> Because this laughter was unlike that of Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">61. In Gen. 17:17 we find, “And Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart.”</i> the giver of the Torah was careful to say that this was “within herself (<i>be-ḳirbah</i>).” <i>Be-ḳirbah</i> refers to the intestine (<i>ḳerev</i>), which is an organ that is inferior to the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">62. Rashi also understands <i>be-ḳirbah</i> as an allusion to her innards. In the Talmud (BT <i>Megillah</i> 9a) this term was one of the emendations of the seventy sages who translated the Bible for Ptolemy of Alexandria. They all changed the term to read <i>bi-ḳeroveha</i> (“her intestines”) to imply an organ inferior to the heart (cf. Rashi’s comments ad loc.). According to this, their emendation was motivated by the same problem that Kaspi raises, and their answer is identical to his.</i> Here it is written “within herself” to indicate an esoteric meaning, which was similarly indicated in (Abraham’s) context by the words “in his heart.”
The Torah is correct in saying, “And the Lord said unto Abraham ‘wherefore did Sarah laugh,’”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">63. V. 13.</i> for it is not proper for the glorified and honored One to converse with women, especially when, as here, they err in the presence of the Lord. It is likewise correct in saying that Sarah denied this, for (we are thereby informed) that the angels informed her to her face | of what she had uttered within herself—(thereby teaching that) “God tries the reins.”<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">64. Jer. 11:20. Kaspi’s criticism of Sarah is balanced in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 55) when he describes her as “a righteous, proper, and humble woman.”</i> In addition these words, “when the season cometh around and Sarah shall have a son,” strengthened what had been said in the earlier vision, which had possibly taken place on the same day.
“And the men rose up from thence.”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">65. V. 16.</i> The inner meaning is self-evident, in that Lot was made to understand the (impending) destruction of Sodom.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">66. He means that no physical messengers visited Lot to bring this news—it all occurred in a dream.</i> Furthermore (we learn) that every action of the Lord, whether good or evil, is effected through angels and messengers, inasmuch as every time that “angel” (<i>mal’akh</i>) occurs in Hebrew, its meaning is “a messenger of the Lord” or occasionally a man’s messenger, whether he be more or less important.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">67. This accords with the <i>Guide</i> II:6, “the meaning of an angel is a messenger … accordingly everyone who carries out an order is an angel.” In <i>Sharsherot Kesef</i> (TK 20), however, Kaspi says: “the Provençal of <i>mel’akhah</i> is <i>oeuvre</i>, and the Provençal of <i>mal’akh</i> is <i>oeuvrier</i>. Therefore the Provençal of <i>mal’akh</i> is not <i>messager</i>, meaning ‘a messenger’—with all due respect to Maimonides. And even though every <i>mal’akh</i> is a messenger, and every messenger is a <i>mal’akh</i>, they are not essentially the same.” Kaspi makes no attempt to reconcile these conflicting comments. <br>Gersonides, throughout his comments to this chapter, considers these men to be contemporary prophets who visited Abraham and Lot at God’s behest. His reason is that <i>mal’akh</i> is a term describing a prophet. According to this, the episode involved no prophetic vision at all.</i>
He who gave the Torah related to us what the Lord said to Himself<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">68. Gen. 18:17–21 relates God’s “thoughts” in the matter of the destruction of Sodom.</i> and what He said to His servants surrounding Him, in the manner done regarding Saul or other (rulers).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">69. Cf. I Sam. 19:1.</i>
The purpose for which He who gave the Torah wrote all this (dialogue) is evident, as is its explanation: the entire discussion is in order to beautify the parable.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">70. Here once again Kaspi refers to the <i>Guide</i>, Introduction, where the second kind of Scriptural parable is only concerned with the main outline of the story, while the details are for embellishment and coherence.</i> This is similar to the Lord’s dialogues with Adam and Cain, where what is important is the meaning that emerges as a whole from the narrative. (In the present instance) the lesson is that sometimes a certain number of righteous people will save a certain number of wicked people. What these numbers are will vary according to the situation, the time, and the place.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">71. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 56) Kaspi says: “these numbers will be explained in the <i>Gevia‘</i>.” Actually their explanation is provided later in this work, in chap. XVII.</i>
Having said this, I will answer the problem that I mentioned in this connection in the <i>Kesef Sigim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">72. While this work is not extant, it appears that the question was: If the episode in Sodom was only a dream, did Lot and his family actually leave Sodom, and was the city destroyed—or was that only in a dream as well? These were questions likewise posed by Nachmanides in his commentary to Gen. 18:1.</i>
“And Abraham returned unto his place.”<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">73. Gen. 18:33.</i> Maimonides explained the equivocal nature of “place” (<i>maḳom</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">74. <i>Guide</i> I:8, “it is a term denoting an individual’s rank and situation … with reference to his perfection in some matter.” Here the meaning would be that Abraham descended from his previous level of prophetic inspiration.</i>
“And the two angels came to Sodom at even.”<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">75. Gen. 19:1.</i> The lengthy narrative that is written here by Him who gave the Torah is in order to beautify the parable,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">76. Cf. above n. 70.</i> in addition to several lessons that are to be learned from each and every expression, which it is not necessary to describe.
(The answer to the problem is) let us suppose that we can compare this to one who dreams of such a matter when he is asleep, something that happens to us and to others constantly, as happened at the smiting of the men of Gibeah.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">77. This refers to the episode recounted in Judg. 19–20, which bears several close similarities to the story of the angels in Sodom. In <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 94) he notes this similarity, saying that one should not be surprised at the behavior of the Sodomites, for “the people of Gibeah, who were Israelites, also did this.”</i> (So too Lot) having dreamt this at the outset of the night, arose from his sleep and when awake went out to his sons-in-law to tell them what had transpired.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">78. Accordingly, the prophetic dream concluded when Lot awoke, and they proceeded to leave the city.</i> In any case, He who gave the Torah wrote that Lot was spurred by his thoughts at sunrise, to leave there when awake,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">79. While Kimḥi generally accepts Maimonides’ contention that prophetic experiences occur in visions (cf. his comments to Gen. 15), in the present chapter he is of the opinion that there were angels who assumed human form and visited Lot in Sodom. Kaspi, however, is more consistent in the episode at hand, in asserting that there were no angels in human form.</i> as it concludes, “the sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.”<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">80. Gen. 19:23.</i> This happened after he had seen this entire event, part of which had occurred when he was awake. This was similar to the Lord’s command to Noah, “Make thee an ark of gopher-wood,”<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">81. Gen. 5:14.</i> which was spoken in a dream and fulfilled when awake.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">82. The idea that a prophet, once he is awake, fulfills the directives that were communicated in a vision is taken up below, chap. XXII.</i> He who gave the Torah wrote this in such a manner, so as to teach and inform us.

Chapter 14

This (chapter) explains the fourth vision<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. The expression “fourth vision” is not clear, for it may refer to the entire chapter 22 of Genesis, in which case the binding of Isaac took place only in a vision of prophecy; or else it may refer to the first two verses alone, in which God appears to Abraham and commands the sacrifice. Kimḥi refers to these opening verses as a vision, while Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> II:41) asserts that the angel in verses 11, 15, was “in a vision or a dream.” Later in this work (chap. XVIII), Kaspi considers the possibility that the entire event was a prophetic dream, but does not come to any definite conclusions.</i> | of Abraham, (which begins with) “And it came to pass after these things that God did prove Abraham.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Gen. 22:1.</i> There are deep things in this matter that are discussed elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 46) there is a lengthy discussion of the meaning of <i>nisah</i>, where Kaspi takes issue with Maimonides to say that “even though the Lord knew intellectually that Abraham was a man who feared the Lord, He wanted at this point to have experiential knowledge of this, by way of ‘the Torah speaks in the language of men.’ ”</i> but I will write here what is appropriate to the intention of this work.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 62), in commenting on this chapter, Kaspi writes: “what I have to say on this [episode] will be found in the <i>Gevia‘</i>, and in the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i>.”</i> When He who gave the Torah wrote this story, He intended many final causes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. This refers to the fourth of the four Aristotelian causes, which describes the purpose of an object. On Kaspi’s use of these four causes in his exegesis, see above Chapter 2.</i>
Firstly, He wanted to inform us that God tests people, (to find out) if there are among them those who love Him, or not. This is in accordance with what is stated in the Torah many times. Now even though all (such phrases as “God did prove Abraham”) are to be understood according to “the Torah speaks in the language of men.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. On this principle, see Chapter 2.</i> Maimonides excelled greatly when he said at length, in <i>Guide</i> III: 24, that the intended meaning (of “God did prove Abraham”) was “to make known and inform.” Not everyone, however, will understand what he said. Even so, there is a benefit that accrues to the masses of our people, as well as to the select individuals in their respective ways, and that is that the Lord tests us, (which we take) as an article of faith.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Cf. below in chap. XVIII, where Kaspi explains the benefits, to the masses and the select few, respectively.</i>
The second benefit is (that we are to learn) that it is correct for the Lord, as it is for us, to command something and then later (to command) its opposite, as was the case here.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. This statement is modified later in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, chap. XVIII, where Kaspi says that the later command to desist did not rescind the original command but, rather, clarified its nature.</i> Both commands are correct, in accordance with the moment, for “a word in its season, how good is it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Prov. 15:23.</i> This does not practice deception, for (a command is) a noncategorical statement, which as such does not affirm what is true or false.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. On categorical and noncategorical statements, see above chap. VIII.</i>
The third benefit, besides that mentioned by Maimonides, one that is most precious, is the greatest principle for which the (chapter) was recorded. It was the fact that (Abraham) was prevented from carrying it out at the point when he was approaching the act (of sacrifice of Isaac). For this reason, the verse is careful to say that when He, may He be blessed, commanded this act, it was only by way of a test. Heaven forbid that He would command in such a manner as to intend its fulfillment. The<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. The section that begins here, continuing until “would act in that manner,” was quoted by Abraham b. Solomon in his Arabic commentary to the Prophets. Renan, <i>Ecrivains Juifs Français du XIVe Siècle</i> (Paris, 1893), p. 504, refers to this quotation from Kaspi, but is unable to identify it as coming from the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>.</i> purpose (of the command) was to uproot, undermine, and weaken the established belief that was in the heart of the people, that those who are punctiliously careful take of their children to make sacrifices to their gods. Furthermore, while it is true that He who gave the Torah permitted them to take other forms of life as sacrifice to the Lord our God, as an expression of guilt, Heaven forbid that the human species be used for this purpose. This even includes the prohibition against passing through fire, as is seen from the careful omission of any mention of kindling of fire, even though the high priest would act in that manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. This reference is unclear. Perhaps Kaspi is referring to Lev. 16:27, “and they shall burn in the fire the skins and the flesh and the dung,” which Ibn Ezra explained was performed by the high priest on the Day of Atonement. Cf. Nachmanides to that verse.</i> While it does say earlier that “he took in his hand the fire,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. V. 13, which would imply that a fire was kindled.</i> this is avoided in the verse “And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar on the wood.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. V. 9.</i> Had this stated, “And he placed the fire under the wood,” or “… on the altar,” it would have been understood by foolish people as indicating that Abraham was at least (able) to pass Isaac through the fire.
The significance (of that custom) is known from the Torah and Prophets, in that the ultimate sacrifice in those generations was to offer their children as a sacrifice to their gods, | whether that be by passing them through the fire,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. This custom only singed the body in the fire.</i> or to burn them completely, or to slaughter them and cast their blood as a food-offering to their gods. This is all evident to one who does not sit at street-corners.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Cf. the Talmudic expression <i>yoshvei ḳeranot</i>, alluding to those who spend their time on the streets, not engaged in any useful activity.</i> One can find a specific instance of this in the Book of Kings,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. II Kings 3:27.</i> where the king of Moab sacrificed his eldest son, which was certainly a burnt-offering to his god.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. In that verse it is not clear what was the purpose of that act of sacrifice at that point. Kaspi’s explanation agrees with that of Rashi, as opposed to Kimḥi.</i> It is known that one of our sins was that our people were unable to overcome such beliefs, in spite of all the prophylactic measures used by the Torah to make us understand the matter.
Even Jephthah, who was not one of those considered wicked but only vain,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Kaspi probably has in mind the following statement found in <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 60: “Was there not Phinehas the high priest to absolve his vow? The answer is that Phinehas said, ‘He needs me, why should I go to him?’ While Jephthah said, ‘I am the chief-officer of Israel, why should I go to him?’”</i> in that he was not wise, actually meant to fulfill the will of the Lord when he swore, saying, “Whatsoever cometh forth out of the doors of my house to meet me … it shall be the Lord’s, and I shall offer it up for a burnt-offering.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Judg. 11:31.</i> The meaning of “it shall be the Lord’s” is not as Ibn Ezra explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. There is no surviving commentary of Ibn Ezra to the Book of Judges, so this cryptic reference can only be guessed at. L. Levy, <i>Reconstruction des Commentars Ibn Ezras zu den Ersten Propheten</i> (Heidelberg, 1903), p. 10, contains a passage saying that Jephthah did execute his daughter, and would even have sacrificed an entire family, had it been the first to meet him upon his return home. A more likely version of Ibn Ezra’s view of this episode, and one that fits into the present passage of the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, is to be found in Nachmanides’ Commentary to Lev. 27:29. In that passage Nachmanides says: “Do not be misled by the error of Ibn Ezra, who says that … Jephthah intended that person to be separated from society to serve God in prayer and appreciation, while if it were to be an animal that met him, he would sacrifice it. Accordingly Jephthah built a house for his daughter outside of the city, where she secluded herself, and he supported her all her life, for she knew no man and was bound up there. Such an interpretation is vacuous …” Nachmanides himself is of the opinion that Jephthah’s daughter was in fact sacrificed. This agrees with Kaspi’s view in the passage following this one.</i> Jephthah did not consider the sacrifice of a human being an abomination to the Lord, so that when he said this later, he was not specific, for it never occurred to him that it might be his daughter, as did in fact happen.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. From this, as well as the following passage, it is clear that Kaspi, like Nachmanides, interpreted that episode as culminating in the daughter’s death. This view is opposed by Kimḥi and Gersonides (as well as Ibn Ezra, as we have seen), who in their commentaries to Judges explain the oath as dedicating her to the service of God for the duration of her life. A possible explanation for Kaspi’s rejection of Kimḥi and Ibn Ezra on this point, in spite of their general influence on his work, might emphasize Kaspi’s preference for a literal reading of Scripture. In the episode at hand, the literal meaning appears to point toward the actual sacrifice and death of Jephthah’s daughter. For views similar to Kaspi’s, cf. L. Ginzberg, <i>The Legendi of the Jews</i> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1913), vol. IV, pp. 43–46, vol. VI, p. 203, n. 109.</i> His fate proves his lack of wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. It would have been more accurate to say, “his daughter’s fate proves his lack of wisdom.”</i> For in spite of everything, had he been wise he would have withdrawn his vow.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. Cf. n. 19.</i> Instead he imagined that the (consummation of his vow) was an act of great piety. While he read this episode (of Genesis) in particular, having read it he was not aware of this final cause, for he considered the Lord’s prevention of Abraham to be only an act of mercy on account of (Isaac’s being) an only son in (Abraham’s) old age. (So Jephthah thought that) whoever would carry this out would be more praiseworthy and pious, especially (for someone like) Jephthah, a young man in his prime.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. As a young man Jephthah could have other children, unlike Abraham.</i> It is possible that Jephthah expected an angel to call out to him, “Lay not thy hand upon the lad,” and continued to wait for it.
So this foolish enthusiast sacrificed his only daughter in fire unto the Lord, in a similar manner to what the wise Abraham began to do with his only son, and similar to the act of the king of Moab in sacrificing his eldest son to his god Chemosh,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. Chemosh was the god of Moab, as in I Kings 11:7, 23.</i> as well as similar to the acts of some of our people, who in their sin sacrificed to idols. Because Jephthah was one of our lesser leaders, the sages said, “Jephthah was in his generation like Samuel in his generation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. BT <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 25b.</i> His whole life-story reflects this, for it contains only that one military victory,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. Actually two victories are recorded: II Kings 11:33 (against Moab) and II Kings 12:4 (against Gilead).</i> something which happens to many people.
There is no question<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. The question is that this verse favors the explanation of Kimḥi and Gersonides (cf. n. 22) that it was her sexual satisfaction, not her life, that was at stake.</i> from the fact that it is written that the maiden said “bewail my virginity, I and my companions,” for these were none other than Miriam and her companions Hulda and Deborah.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. The context would imply that all four of these women remained virgins; however, Judg. 4:4 describes Deborah as the wife of Lappidoth. The only other reference to these women as a group is in BT <i>Megillah</i> 14b, “There were two arrogant women and their names are evil—the one is Deborah, and the other Huldah.” Kaspi might include Miriam as an arrogant woman on account of her comment in Num. 12:2, “Hath the Lord spoken only with Moses, hath he not spoken also with us?” Accordingly, Jephthah’s daughter would be considered arrogant for bemoaning her virginal state.</i> She was but a complete fool, as was her father, and the reason that she did not bemoan her (impending) death was that she imagined that she would be saved, and thereby achieve the level of Isaac. She cried instead | over her virginity, which would be destroyed in (passing through) the fire, and would prevent the pleasure that would otherwise have been gotten by one of the young men beloved of her. There are many such nonsensical things (that could be attributed) to her and her girlfriends, who were undoubtedly many, as is evident from their subsequent gathering at the place of the burning to bewail her (fate).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. Judg. 11:40.</i> (This is similar to) what is written regarding the death of Moses, “And the children of Israel wept for Moses,”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. Deut. 34:8.</i> where they did not even have the place where he died before them, for it was unknown. (If so, then) certainly in the case of this fool who built an altar on which to sacrifice his daughter in fire to the Lord, in imitation of Abraham, who was called by the Lord “my friend,”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. Isa. 41:8.</i> (they gathered to bewail her where she had died). But in truth, Jephthah substituted <i>’oyev</i> (“enemy”) for <i>’ohev</i> (“friend”).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. <i>’Ohev</i> is lit. “one who is a lover of.”</i> The fact that it is not written that Jephthah built an altar does not pose a problem, for the author of the Book of Judges was a wise man<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. According to BT <i>Bava’ Batra’</i> 14b, the author of Judges was Samuel the prophet.</i> for whom it was more than sufficient to write of this matter using hidden terms and words. This is certainly true in view of the fact that it is not necessary to write everything, as I have stated several times.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. For further discussion of the issue of Scriptural precision, see above pp. 60 ff.</i>
In general, the Torah attempted to cure this serious disease that occurred in our people in those times, similar to the manner in which it is presented here.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. Ibn Ezra quotes Saadya’s explanation that the binding of Isaac was for the benefit of Abraham’s contemporaries, who would learn from his example. Maimonides, in <i>Guide</i> III:24, takes strong exception to this explanation, saying that the event was not known to anyone but Abraham and Isaac themselves. According to this view, the present phrase by Kaspi, “in those times,” must be taken to refer to the period when the Israelites were in the desert and, subsequently, in the land of Canaan, and not to the patriarchal era, since it was only in the later period, after the Book of Genesis was written, that they could have known of the episode. A similar theme is struck in Kimḥi’s comments to Gen. 22:1.</i> This is in accordance with my earlier words, stating that these books preface the commandments. For this reason, He who gave the Torah spoke at length in describing the offensive nature of this (child-sacrifice), when He said, “also their sons and daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods,”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. Deut. 12:31.</i> an act that was particularly associated with Molech.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. See Lev. 18:21, 20:3.</i> For this reason too, the punishment for this sin is greater than all (other) sins, if sacrifice is made to others—quite the opposite of the thoughts of those who considered this child-sacrifice most appropriate for all people. It was enough—more than enough—that in one respect He permitted them to kill an animal, that which is our brother (species), the offspring of our father (genus that is known as) “living,” which is the category that most immediately encompasses us humans and the animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">40. In explaining the genealogical details that follow the binding of Isaac (Gen. 22:20–24), Kaspi says (<i>Ṭirat Kesef</i>, MK I 102–103) that the genus and species are to be compared to the father-and-son relationship, for one father can beget many children and grandchildren. Accordingly, genus corresponds to “living” while species would be “man,” with another species, such as livestock, to be considered a “brother” species. The importance that Kaspi attaches to these logical categories is discussed in Chapter 2, above pp. 48–49. One can also note the probable influence of Francis of Assisi in Kaspi’s attitude to the fate of animals and other forms of animate life, which is markedly sensitive to the death of animate beings—see, for example, Kaspi’s explanation for sending away the mother bird (<i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i>, MK II 293). For further discussion, see S. Pines, “Histabberut,” p. 315, and W. Bacher, “Joseph Ibn Kaspi als Bibelerklärer,” <i>Festschrift zu Herman Cohens Siebzigstem Geburtstag</i> (Berlin: Cassirer, 1912), pp. 119–135.</i> But while this was (permitted) with conditions, it was not so with relation to the human species, for man was created in the image of God. Consequently such worship entails the sin of murder and the sin of committing an abomination before the Lord, as I have explained.
Notice the precision of Jeremiah’s words, for those who can understand. For he wrote in his book, and mentioned it three times, which is the number of sins of our people,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">41. Cf. Amos 2:4, 6, “For three transgressions of Judah will I not reverse it …”</i> that “they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind”;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">42. Jer. 7:31.</i> and elsewhere, “And they have built the high places of Baal, | to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind to do this abomination.”<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">43. Jer. 19:5.</i> Now examine the words of these statements, especially “which I commanded not.” Why say that He has not commanded us to worship Baal and Molech—the meaning, however, must be that what is not commanded is that we do this (even) for Him, may His name be blessed, for it is abominable to Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">44. He means this should be read as if: “which I did not even command you to sacrifice to me …”</i> And even though He commanded us to do this (sacrifice) for Him using animals, that was, so to speak, by force and through circumstance, as happened when He led the people round about by way of the desert,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">45. Exod. 15:37.</i> forced in a way lest the people turn back.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">46. The entire passage recapitulates the <i>Guide</i> III:32, invoking the same illustration to show that in certain matters, including sacrifices, God has no choice but to permit certain forms of behavior, as a means to their eventual eradication.</i>
Jeremiah was also careful when he said, by way of “the Torah speaks in the language of men,” that “it neither came into my mind.” It means that “I never thought that after the express prohibitions anyone would make such a sacrifice of his children.” This is the meaning of “this abomination,” as if to say, “Had this occurred to me I might have commanded this to be done for me, for I have commanded them to do for me other things similar to this, until such time as their misconceptions be dissipated.”
So in general the (main) purpose of writing this narrative in the Torah is this one. Perhaps, as Maimonides wrote,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">47. Maimonides (<i>Guide</i> III:24) said that Abraham established the unity of God, by drawing people to his faith.</i> its impact exists up to the present time. (Moses) wrote this (chapter) and did what he could, even though he saw at the end that the people would “rise up and go astray after the foreign gods of the land,”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">48. Deut. 31:16.</i> (for he wanted) peace and truth in his own lifetime. (Moses) communicated this to them in the context of Abraham, our first patriarch, for God had prevented him from making such a sacrifice to Him, and Abraham had made the sacrifice to Him by substituting a ram, (teaching that) it is proper for us to do the same. It was especially on this account that He commanded that a ram be included in the sacrifices to be made to Him. While this was to be communicated to the masses, it was also to be understood, by the select individuals among us, that even the sacrifice of a ram and other animals was something not desirable to the Lord. Reliable evidence of this is that clearly, after God told him “lay not thy hand upon the lad,” it is not written that He said to Abraham, “instead offer a sacrifice to me using a ram or another (animal).” Instead it is stated that Abraham, of his own volition, “took the ram and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son.” This was to teach us that (the sacrifice of the ram) was not the Lord’s first and primary intention. It is also careful not to say that Abraham sacrificed the ram on the altar that he had built, but (it says that) he offered it on the mountain,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">49. V. 14, “in the mount where the Lord is seen.”</i> as if to teach us that it is not proper to do such a thing on an altar, or on any attractive structure. The reason is that an altar without any sacrifice on it is more acceptable as a sign and a memorial, | as I said earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">50. See chap VI, p. 161, where Kaspi indicates a preference for altars that serve as memorials rather than as places of sacrifice.</i> And though even an altar and house (of offering) are themselves not the most desired good, they are nonetheless more acceptable, if made, than is sacrifice, as Maimonides wrote.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">51. <i>Guide</i> III:32.</i>
(The Torah) teaches us other vaunted secrets and beautiful wisdom, in the manner of all of the Lord’s works, of which the Torah is one—in accordance with the fact known to us that our Torah is from heaven.
Accordingly, when it says here, “And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns,”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">52. V. 13.</i> the words “lifted up his eyes” teach us that it was (an act) not consciously caused or intended, but rather was a circumstantial sighting, quite accidental, similar to “and Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of the Jordan.”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">53. Gen. 13:10.</i>
The word <i>’ayil</i> (“ram”) teaches us in the first place that the sacrifice was of an animal. In the second place, by derivation from <i>’eilei ha-’areṣ</i> (“the mighty of the land”),<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">54. Ezek. 13:17.</i> we learn that this was a matter of force, i.e., force, might, and coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">55. He means that even the substitution of the ram and its sacrifice was an act of questionable desirability, the result of circumstance and contingency.</i> Furthermore (<i>’ayil</i> alludes to) the mighty of the land, in that ministers, deputies, and kings desire things such as this. In any case, there is a further implication by virtue of metathesis, i.e., to <i>ya’al</i>, as in “Moses took upon him (<i>ho’il</i>) to expound this law,”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">56. Deut. 1:5.</i> a phrase that points to coercion.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">57. The passage is curiously contradicted by Kaspi in his <i>Sharsherot Kesef</i> (TK 17), where he explains that <i>ya’al</i> indicates “desire.” In fact he accuses Kimḥi of being inconsistent in explaining <i>ho’il Mosheh</i> as “Moses desired,” while explaining <i>vayo’el Sha’ul</i> (“and Saul adjured”) as a forced oath. Here Kaspi is himself guilty of inconsistency.</i> This was (the kind of coercion that) began with coercion but ended with freedom of will, in the manner of those who cast their baggage into the sea, as Aristotle wrote.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">58. The only such reference is to be found in the Pseudo-Aristotelian <i>Problemata</i> XXII, 931b, 19–38, which explains why a stormy sea is calmed when objects are cast into that sea. Consequently Kaspi explains that as an act done unwillingly, but whose end-product is desirable.</i> This is all alluded to by the word <i>’ayil</i>, with this allusion to be found in regard to the word <i>ḥovlim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">59. This alludes to the use of metathesis, as demonstrated by the word <i>ḥovlim</i>, in the <i>Guide</i> II:43.</i>
It is furthermore written, “behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns.” This indicates in the first place the matter of coercion, for the ram was caught in the thorns, held there with bonds that prevented anyone from taking it. The Torah indicates especially, by means of the term <i>sevakh</i> (“thicket”), which is derived from the contortion (<i>sibukh</i>) and confusion of thought, that the practice of sacrifice signifies confused thinking.
The term <i>beḳarnav</i> (“by his horns”) indicates knowledge and mental representation, for (<i>ḳeren</i>) alludes to what is elevated and sublime, as in “my horn (<i>ḳarni</i>) is exalted”<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">60. I. Sam. 2:1.</i> and “He lifted up a horn (<i>ḳeren</i>) for His people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">61. Ps. 148:14.</i>
Do not take these minute observations that are made in regard to these delicate subjects as finding meanings that were never intended by their speaker, for this is precisely the style of Him who gave our Torah in profound matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">62. For the implications of this statement, see above p. 60.</i> There are many of this species to be found in the prophetic writings, as Maimonides alluded when explaining <i>ḥashmal, ḥovlim</i>, and the others.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">63. <i>Guide</i> II:43.</i> All that he said is valid, in agreement with the truth that “issues from the well of salvation,”<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">64. Isa. 12:3.</i> and from his book do we draw forth (the truth).
Thus, what emerges from all this is that the primary intention (of the episode was to teach us) the prevention of (the sacrifice of) offspring, as mentioned. As for the sacrifice of the ram that is mentioned, (the lesson is) our forefather acted voluntarily, which was intended to assure that we would practice self-control (and not sacrifice). If, however, we do choose to make a sacrifice because, to our discredit, we are not able to exist without them, (we are taught that) we should sacrifice only to Him, may He be magnified, in the way that our forefather did. |
Now notice the difference between the lesson that a fool will glean from the verses of the Torah and what a treasured individual will take from them. For in this episode, what is known to the select individual to be a complete abomination to the Lord is taken by the masses as something which, if completed, would constitute the pinnacle of worship and what is desired by God. This is certainly, primarily true of the masses of that generation to whom the Torah was given.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">65. Kaspi’s attitude to that generation is summed up in <i>Tam Ha-Kesef</i> (TK 32) when he says, “they were an ordinary collection of masses,” who believed in all kinds of nonsense.</i> They must have been proud of the piety of Abraham, the progenitor, who wanted to sacrifice his only son, and would have been even happier in praising this father had he finished the act, priding themselves before their Egyptian and other neighbors. The Torah, which is perfect and without blemish, revealed the truth by using words and statements whose exoteric meaning points to things that will be understood by the foolish, but whose subtle and esoteric meaning points out the truth to the treasured few. The sages, who knew all the intentions and secrets of the Torah, excelled in saying, “The Torah was written as black fire on white fire.”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">66. JT <i>Shekalim</i> 6:1.</i> Maimonides also excelled when he said that the Torah was written by way of “apples of gold in settings of silver.”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">67. Introduction to the <i>Guide</i> in referring to Prov. 25:11.</i>
Maimonides excelled further in saying that the intention of the Torah, in informing us that the actual binding took place three days after the command, was so that we should not imagine that it was carried out in confusion and haste, but rather after considered thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">68. A similar thought is found in Rashi and Nachmanides in their comments on that verse.</i> For Abraham (must have) wondered how the Lord could command him to perform such an abomination as it was subsequently shown to be. He longed in silence to know the Lord’s intent—not only three days, but four, five, or more, for (after) “on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off,” it is written twice that “they went both of them together.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">69. Vv. 6, 8, which could be taken to mean that they continued “together” for some time after the initial three days had elapsed.</i> This accords with what Elijah understood here, for he went on many journeys with Elisha in going up to heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">70. II Kings 2:1–6, which says that Elijah and Elisha “went together,” “came together,” “came down,” prior to the ascent of Elijah in the whirlwind, without specifying the time that had elapsed.</i>
This consideration also provides one of the reasons that Abraham left the young men behind, in that it must have taken several days for Abraham to construct the altar by himself, with some help from the lad Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">71. Accordingly, Isaac at the time was a young boy. This follows Maimonides’ belief that Isaac could not have been thirty seven, for in that case Isaac’s merit in accepting the sacrifice would far have exceeded Abraham’s. (This opinion is attributed to Maimonides by his son, Abraham Maimuni.) Cf. S. Baron, <i>A Social and Religious History of the Jews</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1958), vol. VI, p. 480, n. 90. Ibn Ezra suggested that Isaac was thirteen (in his comments to Gen. 22:4).</i> Other reasons for (leaving them behind) were the fact that they were inferior people, as our sages said, “they were people who are to be compared to an ass,”<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">72. BT <i>Yevamot</i> 62a; BT <i>Ketuvot</i> 111a, which is based on Abraham’s telling them to remain with the ass.</i> who consequently were not fit to accompany Abraham in such a holy place, as was the case with (God saying to Moses) “draw not nigh hither.”<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">73. Exod. 3:5.</i> In addition they were not compatible | with the revelation of so important a secret as this, nor with the performance of so important an act by Abraham, nor that they should (even) recognize the existence of the problem of procrastination that I have referred to.
He who gave the Torah was likewise careful not to mention that Abraham kindled any fire below the wood once Isaac was placed on the altar, in accordance with the reason that I discussed above. An additional reason was that the wood would have easily and swiftly caught fire, thereby giving off some smoke that might have suffocated Isaac.
While our patriarch Abraham was a man of God,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">74. Kaspi says that because Abraham was a man of God, one might expect him to accept God’s command without any questions and without any hesitation, whereas in fact Abraham was careful to consider the possibility that Kaspi goes on to describe.</i> he was not a fool who might confuse contingent statements with necessary ones, so one must say that he did consider the possibility of what did (in fact) happen, when “the angel of the Lord called out to him out of heaven.” Reliable evidence that (he considered this possibility) is the fact that he said, “God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering.” Had he been a fool and not foreseen that possibility, he would have hurried to slaughter his son, as did the fool the king of Moab.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">75. Cf. above nn. 17–18.</i>
He who gave the Torah was furthermore careful in that the command (to sacrifice Isaac) is recorded as using only one name (without repetition), while in preventing (the sacrifice, the Torah records) “Abraham, Abraham,” where (the repetition) is to inform us that the royal edict to desist was more insistent than the command (to sacrifice had been). This allusion is intended for singular individuals, while for the masses (the repetition of the name) is taken to allude to the fact that the sword was already placed on Isaac’s neck, out of Abraham’s urgent desire to slaughter him.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">76. Such an explanation accords with Kimḥi’s comments.</i> The knowledgeable individual, however, will benefit from the first and truthful exposition.
There is another careful usage by Him who wrote the Torah. When commanding the sacrifice, “God” is mentioned, not the glorious name (which is the tetragrammaton). Accordingly Abraham said, “God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering,” and it says, “of which God had told him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">77. V. 3.</i> Even subsequent (to the order to desist), when speaking <i>ex post facto</i>, it is said, “… thou art a God-fearing man,”<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">78. V. 12.</i> instead of “a man who fears the Lord.” When desisting, however, it is written, “the angel of the Lord,” instead of “the angel of God.” It also says, “in the mount where the Lord is seen.”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">79. V. 14.</i> This is further explained elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">80. Cf. the opening chapters of the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>.</i> where I explain the names of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">81. The general subject of God’s names is discussed above in Chapter 3, and the specific reference to this chapter will be found there.</i>
The Torah is likewise careful to state simply, “offer him there for a burnt-offering,” and “he offered him up for a burnt-offering instead of his son,” without any mention that it was a burnt-offering “to the Lord” or “to God.” While this (latter statement that Abraham offered the ram instead of his son) occurred at the command to desist, when Abraham was speaking with the glorious Lord and His angel, heaven forbid that Abraham offer the sacrifice to “the Lord,” neither as the preferred goal nor from any other consideration.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">82. This is in answer to the question that might be posed: Why does the Torah not say that Abraham offered the sacrifice to “the Lord,” in accordance with his perception of the divine existent, as had been explained in the earlier chapters of the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef?</i></i> I mean to say that this is in accordance with Abraham’s status, for what came later (in the Torah regarding sacrifice to “the Lord”) was necessary only for the masses, but not for the individual and the few for whom (sacrifice) is an abomination. Neither does it say that (Abraham offered the ram) “to God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">83. This is in answer to the question: If it was “God” who commanded the sacrifice in the first place, then Abraham should have offered the substitute ram to that “God,” so why is the name of God omitted?</i> for that would have reaffirmed the masses of our people in their belief that (sacrifices) should be made to the cherubim | and the other forms that they make for themselves. This (belief of the masses) is the same as what was said at the incident of the golden calf, when they offered sacrifices to it, saying, “This is thy God, O Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">84. Exod. 32:4.</i> Accordingly there is much in this phrase that says “he offered him up for a burnt-offering.”
The use of the name “Lord” is for the benefit of the select few, while most mention of the name “God” is for the benefit of the masses. This is the case throughout the entire Torah, in that it arranges the benefits in accordance with these two categories that exist in the people. While because of (our many) sins one cannot appropriately consider the select few to constitute an (entire) category, nonetheless this could be compared to the sun and the moon, which, even though they be individuals, are called a species.
The sum product of Maimonides’ comments on this episode, and of what I have said that was stimulated by him, is that there are many purposes for which the entire incident was recorded, which are in addition to the many benefits that are to be found in the several details of a story such as this.
The first two benefits—those that are mentioned by Maimonides—are, in short, to teach us the extent to which the fear of heaven can reach,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">85. In the MS at this point there is a repetition of the last sentence, clearly a mistake. It is, however, almost certain that what should be inserted here is the second benefit listed by Maimonides in that chapter of the <i>Guide</i>, and which is here included in the parentheses. The omission of this benefit might not be entirely accidental, for its point is somewhat contradicted by Kaspi’s earlier statement (cf. above chap. X, p. 196) that Abraham was uncertain of his comprehension of God’s words in the earlier visions in chap. 15 of Genesis.</i> (as well as to teach us the confidence that a prophet has that his vision is accurate).
The third benefit is that (we learn that) the Holy King does test His servants, and therefore one should be on guard for this, especially with regard to false prophets, in that it is vital that we believe (that they are sent to test us). For if this happened to our patriarch, it cannot but happen to us.
The fourth benefit is that this King can say one thing (today) and its opposite tomorrow, all according to the setting. This is similar to “at that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi,”<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">86. Deut. 10:8. Kaspi means that originally (Exod. 13:2) God had taken the firstborn unto Him, an act which is apparently rescinded at the episode of the golden calf, where God takes the Levites in their stead—in this case too, there is no contradiction, for it is all “according to the setting.”</i> which does not express any change or substitution in Him, as those who know the truth can attest.
The fifth benefit is that we are taught that Mount Moriah is a place chosen by the Lord, as was certainly affirmed by Abraham and Isaac on this auspicious occasion. Accordingly all our generations should agree that the house of God should be there, without disagreement and everyone requesting that this place be within its allotted portion, as mentioned by Maimonides.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">87. <i>Guide</i> III:45.</i>
The sixth benefit is (to teach us that) heaven forbid that the Lord desire one to make a sacrifice or an offering of any non-human thing.
The seventh benefit (teaches that) He wishes sacrifices and offerings to consist of that which is other than human.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">88. He means that if sacrifices have to be made, then they should consist of animals.</i>
The eighth benefit is (to teach us that) He does not want (such nonhuman sacrifice) with any essential or primary intentions, but only in an ancillary intention, in that He tolerates a restricted number of sacrifices being offered to Him when “any man of you bringeth an offering.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">89. Lev. 1:2, which is understood by the <i>Sifra’ Lev</i>. as saying, “this is permission granted to sacrifice (but it is not a command).”</i>
The ninth benefit | (is that we learn) that it is not correct under 147 any circumstances for a descendant of Abraham to do such a thing unto other gods, in the manner of the nations, for Abraham did not do such a thing.
The tenth benefit is found in the conclusion, from “and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham a second time” until “… because thou hast hearkened to my voice.”<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">90. Vv. 15–16.</i> (It is the promise of an earthly reward) because the masses will not uphold all or even a few of the (above-mentioned) nine goals, unless they know that there is this reward, and in order to receive a reward that consists of a material good, which pertains to this world. The select individuals, however, have no reward in this world,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">91. Cf. BT <i>Ḥullin</i> 142b, “there is no reward in this world.”</i> and as for the world to come, that reward comes by itself in the fulfillment of truth, Torah, and wisdom—which are all one.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">92. Kaspi devotes one of the homilies in <i>Tam Ha-Kesef</i> (TK 1–7) to an examination of the rewards in both worlds and asserts that material rewards have as their only purpose “the achievement of wisdom and perfection.” For a discussion of Kaspi’s assertion that truth, the Torah, and philosophic wisdom are all “one,” see Mesch, <i>Studies</i>, pp. 96–106.</i>
The Torah is careful to allude twice to reward. The first was at the beginning, when saying, “because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son,” which refers to (Abraham’s obedience to) the command (to sacrifice). The other was at the conclusion of his words, saying, “because thou hast hearkened to my voice,”<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">93. V. 12.</i> which refers to (the command) to desist, which was superior. This (reward) would take effect in the manner that we have described.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">94. In the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 63) Kaspi gives the same explanation, adding, “as I will explain in the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i>.” The editor comments that there is no such explanation in the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> —it is obvious that the reference should correctly refer to the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>.</i>
One could ask why this reward and recompense is stated by the Lord as “because thou hast done this thing”; after all, what is promised here is the great multiplication of his seed, and that was something already promised to him by the Lord on many occasions—what does the Lord introduce here that is new? The answer is that what is new is contained in the words “By myself I have sworn,”<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">95. V. 16. This answer is similar to the answers of Ibn Ezra, Nachmanides, and Kimḥi. Kaspi, however, is the only one to adduce proof from Gen. 24:7.</i> for up to that point the Lord had never taken an oath on this matter (regarding his seed) that meant to say that the decree (of multiplication of seed that had been previously mentioned) was as necessary as tomorrow’s sunrise. Accordingly this (oath) constitutes a great and merciful innovation.
Notice too how He who gave the Torah revealed to us the distinction between <i>dibber</i> (“he said”) and <i>nishba‘</i> (“swore”), when He said later, “… and who spoke unto me and who swore unto me saying, ‘unto thy seed will I give this land.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">96. Gen. 24:7.</i> This (“spoke unto me” refers to the promise of the inheritance of the land that) was made in the earliest visions,<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">97. Cf. Gen. 12:7, “And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, ‘unto thy seed will I give this land …’”</i> while “who swore unto me” refers to the (oath taken in the) vision of the Sundering.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">98. Cf. Gen. 15:18, “In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, ‘unto thy seed have I given this land …’”</i>
The general principle is that <i>dibber</i> (“said”) and <i>ḥashav</i> (“thought’) are generic terms, while <i>nishba‘</i> (“swore”) is the species. This is the same as the relation of “animate” to “man.” Consequently, every use of <i>nishba‘</i> is a species of <i>dibber</i>, and not the reverse.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">99. For further discussion of this and other uses of the categories of genus and species, see above Chapter 2.</i> Remember all of this.

Chapter 15

(This chapter deals) with many solutions to the numerous doubts which I wrote of in <i>Kesef Sigim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. See above pp. 128–129 for a discussion of the relationship of the <i>Kesef Sigim</i> the present work.</i> alluded to in the questions numbered eighteen, nineteen, twenty, and twenty-one, (which I will deal with here) because these four numbers relate to the four wonderful visions which are ascribed | to Abraham by Him who wrote the Torah. He wrote them for us, so that we should notice certain observations. We have already written some of this above, but I will now go back to them to complete matters.
In the first place, with regard to Abraham’s first vision, to which I raised questions that were included in the total of twenty-eight,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. There were evidently twenty-eight questions in <i>Kesef Sigim</i> relating to Genesis, as can be seen from the end of the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef</i>, which concludes Genesis with the twenty-eighth question.</i> I prefaced the solution of the first doubt by saying that the decree of slavery was not made in order to punish (Abraham’s descendants). It was instead a burden to be suffered for the sake of great profit, similar to those who go out to sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Cf. above chap. IX, p. 190.</i> This is as the wise man has said, “You shall not achieve that for which you yearn, without first enduring that which you despise.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Cf. above chap. IX, p. 193.</i> As for the question, mentioned in Kesef Sigim, that what is written in the Book of Samuel, “and again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and He moved David against them,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. II Sam. 24:1.</i> does not specifically mention how they sinned, there is no problem. For a prophet is to be relied upon when he says that the Lord was angry with them, as the Lord would not do this without reason. As Maimonides said,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Maimonides, in the <i>Guide</i> I:36, emphatically asserts that every reference to divine anger in Scripture is found in the context of idolatry. Kaspi raises the question in his commentaries (AM 46) that God becomes angry with Moses in Exod. 4:14, and if so, could Moses be guilty of idolatry? In the <i>’Ammudei Kesef</i> there, Kaspi suggests that Maimonides simply forgot about that reference, but in the <i>Maskiyyot Kesef</i> he says that Maimonides’ intention was to assert the fact that Moses did not possess a strong faith at that stage. This interpretation of Maimonides must be kept in mind in reading the passage that follows in the present work, especially the phrase “any incomplete knowledge of the Lord.”</i> in general one cannot find any expression of (divine) anger in any of the books of the Bible, unless it be with reference to idolatry. Subsequently Maimonides implied that idolatry is a genus encompassing every mental thought that attributes to the Lord any emotions or shortcomings, or any incomplete knowledge of the Lord. Therefore no question is posed by the many places throughout the books of the Bible where one finds an expression of anger attributed to the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Cf. preceding note.</i> Maimonides refers to this secret when he says that our inability to perceive His essence does not constitute idolatry, unless one bows down to some image.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. <i>Guide</i> I:36 states: “now the books of the Prophets only make this strong assertion [of anger] because it asserts a strong assertion attaching to Him, may He be exalted; I refer to idolatrous worship.”</i>
As for what I mentioned there (in <i>Kesef Sigim</i> when I noted that) the Lord did not reveal to Samuel any immediate sin or anger, (the answer is that) it is the same as when the Lord said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who heareth it shall tingle,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. I Sam. 3:11.</i> whose explanation follows in close proximity when it says, “In that day will I perform against Eli all that I have spoken against his house.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. I Sam. 3:12.</i> The anger of the Lord against Hophni and Phinehas, as communicated by the man of God, as well as the decree that they would both die on one day, was what had been previously spoken.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Cf. I Sam. 2:27–36.</i> These (two) were at the head of the army, | and caused the defeat of Israel on account of their sins,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. The account of the military defeat and the loss of the Ark is recounted in I Sam. 4:1–11. The sins of Eli’s sons are recounted in I Sam. 2:12 ff.</i> for they were the high priests who led the Ark that went with the camp at its head. Now when they fled, the battle-formation was broken, as happened at the incident of Achan, as I will yet explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. The story of the defeat of Achan and his army is recounted in Josh. 7. Kaspi discusses the event below in chap. XX. See also above, p. 117.</i> This is because an individual can turn a multitude when he is at the head of a battle-formation or of the people. The proof of this is (what happened to) Zedekiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. Jer. 39:4 relates that “it came to pass that when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled …”</i> It has already been said that the fate decreed for the whole will change the fate decreed over its part.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. I have been unable to locate the reference for this somewhat cryptic remark.</i>
As for the question appropriate to this book, mentioned in <i>Kesef (Sigim)</i>, asking what was the sin (of the Egyptians), for after all, the Lord had decreed that they would enslave the Israelites,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. The same question had been asked by Maimonides in the <i>Shmonah Peraḳim</i> (Introduction to the <i>Ethics of the Fathers</i>), ed. M. D. Rabinowitz (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1962), p. 211, where in the eighth chapter Maimonides answered that God had not decreed which nation would enslave the Israelites—consequently the Egyptians chose freely to enslave them. In the absence of the <i>Kesef Sigim</i>, it is difficult to explain why Kaspi chose to ignore Maimonides’ answer in favor of an ambiguous passage in the <i>Guide</i>.</i> in addition to several other similar passages that I mentioned there, one should know that there is sufficient answer in what Maimonides wrote in the last chapter of the second part (of the <i>Guide</i>), when he said that Scripture usually attributes to the Lord every possible expression, including “acting,” “sending,” and “commanding,” that could refer to any existent, whether human or any other.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. <i>Guide</i> II:48.</i> This applies no matter if that (act) be natural, voluntary, or accidental. The response to the problem is clear—that even though Scripture stated that the Lord decreed and ordered in the case of Pharaoh and the Egyptians that they should do this, the truth of the matter is that they did this out of their own complete free choice. The Lord did not cause them in any essential way. It is the same with Nebuchadnezzar, as recounted in the narratives of Jeremiah, and with Sennacherib in the narratives of Isaiah. It is only that He who gave the Torah provided a common reason for the benefit of the masses when He said that Pharaoh and his people acted with more evil intent than what the Lord desired and had decreed. For this reason, at the time of the decree it is said, “they shall serve them and they shall afflict them,”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Gen. 15:13.</i> and no more, while (at the time of the enslavement) the verse says, “and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor,”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Exod. 1:13; i.e., “with rigor” indicates that the Egyptians went beyond their mandate from the Lord.</i> as well as “and they made their lives bitter,”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Exod. 1:14.</i> and “every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. Exod. 1:22; i.e., the murder of the children cannot be included in the decree “and they shall afflict them.”</i> This was explained further when it is recounted that Jethro said, “for that they dealt proudly against them,”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. Exod. 18:11, which in the Hebrew reads <i>zadu</i>, i.e., deliberate cruelty.</i> which was explained by David when he said, “thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Neh. 9:10.</i> i.e., “they did more than you decreed.” This is in accordance with the general comment of Zechariah, saying, “I was but a little displeased, and they helped for evil.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. Zech. 1:15.</i> Isaiah also explained this in the context of Sennacherib, having learnt the principle from the Torah, when he combined this with other facets of an agent of destruction, in saying of Sennacherib, “O Asshur, the rod of mine anger …”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. Isa. 10:5.</i> until the end of that chapter. Elsewhere, regarding Nebuchadnezzar, Isaiah said similarly when he began with, “Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon …”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. Isa. 47:1.</i> until the end of the chapter, including “Now hear this, thou that art given to pleasures …”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. Isa. 47:8.</i>
| In general he accused Nebuchadnezzar of two sins: the first was that he had not pitied anyone, and had overly pressed his yoke on the elderly;<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. Isa. 47:6, “thou didst show them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke …”</i> the second was that he had denied the Lord who had given him this power.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. Isa. 47:10, “and thou hast been secure in thy wickedness, thou hast said, ‘none seeth me.’”</i>
Jeremiah also wrote something similar when he said, “Thou art my maul and weapons of war.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. Jer. 51:20. In the <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> (AK II 23) Kaspi says that this verse raises “many questions and answers,” and adds that the issue will be found in the <i>Gevia’ Kesef</i>.</i> Isaiah also alluded to this when he called Sennacherib “the Lord’s anger,”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. Isa. 10:5, “O Asshur, the rod of mine anger …”</i> intending him to strike with a rod by way of rebuke. In this matter he mauled with the rod, dying<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. The reference of the predicate is unclear, in that they could refer to the demise of Asshur or of the enemies of the Lord, i.e., the tribe of Judah, which was mauled by Nebuchadnezzar, as recounted in Jer. 52.</i> under the rod. Jeremiah also said, “for the Lord (is a God of recompenses),”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. Jer. 51:56. It is not clear that this is the verse that Kaspi refers to, for the MS is unclear at this point. Going by the first two words “El tetragrammaton” (cf. fol. 148a), the verse quoted in the translation would make the best sense.</i> i.e., (Sennacherib) acted with excessive evil.
Solomon also explained this when he said of the Lord, “The Lord hath made everything for His own purpose, yea, even the wicked for the day of evil,”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. Prov. 16:4.</i> as I explained in its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. Kaspi’s explanation of this verse in his first commentary on Proverbs follows Ibn Janaḥ’s <i>Sefer Ha-Shorashim</i>, to say that all things were created with their intended purpose in mind. In the second commentary, Kaspi says (AS I 105) that the implication of the verse is that the wicked are the tools of God, “like the arrows in the hand of a warrior,” to effect divine retribution. Such tools might themselves be punished at a later stage—as was the case with Nebuchadnezzar, who was punished by Cyrus and Darius.</i>
Proof is (the history of) the kings of Israel, as is evident from the narrative of their lives, wherein the second (king) destroyed the first, and the third destroyed the second, as happened to them all. As for what was said of Baasa in “And moreover by the hand of Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the Lord against Baasa … because of all the evil that he did … and because he smote him,”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. I Kings 16:7.</i> this (last phrase) refers to what was in the distant future, i.e., that Jehu prophesied that Zimri would destroy Baasa and his house, as is subsequently written, “Thus did Zimri destroy …”<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. V. 12.</i>
As a rule, whenever there are two people or many wicked nations, it is divine wisdom, as well as complete justice, that one of them will destroy the other in a manner that is deserved, such as the sword, while subsequently another wicked (agent) comes and destroys the earlier victor.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. BT <i>Makkot</i> 10b provides the following situation that explains how this works: a man who committed murder but cannot be punished because of some technicality happens to be sitting in a room, and is killed accidentally when a man who should have been committed to a city of refuge for manslaughter falls upon him from a nearby ladder. In this way the former is killed, as he deserves, while the latter is sent to the city of refuge after all, for the present homicide. In this case, the latter is the tool of God.</i> So it is always. He who gave the Torah alluded to this when He says of the victory of the descendants of Lot over the rest of the nations, that the Lord had decreed thus to destroy the victor, as it says “(And in Seir dwelt the Horites aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead;) as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the Lord gave unto them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. Deut. 2:12. In <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 275) Kaspi says that this verse teaches that nations possess and are dispossessed of lands “according to God’s will.”</i> In several places the success of Israel is attributed to the righteousness of the patriarchs, and the fact that He had sworn to them (not to destroy their descendants)—which is true, but in addition (their victory) was attributable to “the wickedness of these nations.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">40. Deut. 9:5.</i> Proof of this is the victory of the descendants of Lot,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">41. Cf. above n. 39, as well as Deut. 2:9, “because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.”</i> even though they did not have the merits of the patriarchs or the oath of the Lord. For this reason Ibn Ezra said of the expression “at the hand of every beast will I require it”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">42. Gen. 9:5, and Ibn Ezra’s comment thereon.</i> that it means, “I will order another to kill this one.”<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">43. He means that if one beast kills a human, it will itself be killed by another beast, effecting natural justice even in the animal world.</i> Hillel also said, “Because you have drowned others, others have drowned you; those who drowned you shall themselves be drowned,”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">44. BT <i>Ethics of the Fathers</i> 2:7, BT <i>Succah</i> 50a.</i> which is satisfactory and completely just, in that it is universal that a destroyer, | whether he be man or some other animal, will be surrounded by his fellows who will plot against his life.
This is similar to Isaiah, who said, “When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoilt; and when thou art weary of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">45. Isa. 33:1.</i> Habakkuk likewise, in answering his confusion regarding the success of Nebuchadnezzar, (wrote) that in truth Nebuchadnezzar was evil, and had not succeeded on account of his righteousness, but only because it was necessary for him to destroy some other wicked (person).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">46. Hab. 1:12, “thou hast ordained them for judgment …” and v. 13, “when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he …”</i> Later Habakkuk says of him, “Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall exact interest of thee … because thou hast spoilt many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall spoil thee.”<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">47. Hab. 2:7-8.</i> This states the solution that is found in the Torah and the Prophets, without reference to the masses, that is (that they would be punished on account of) the sins mentioned in Isaiah and Jeremiah. This issue is likewise mentioned in Zechariah.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">48. Zech. 1:15.</i>
This is certainly true when there is, in addition, some sin, such as when Isaiah attributed to Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar the denial of the Lord, who had given them the power,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">49. Cf. above nn. 28-29.</i> and the performance of sorcery,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">50. Isa. 47:9, “for the multitude of thy sorceries and the great abundance of thy enchantments …”</i> and others. There is, however, sufficient answer for the select few people in the other explanations that I mentioned, i.e., “the rod of my anger,” “thou art my maul,” “the wicked for the day of evil,” “at the hand of every beast will I require it,” as well as what was written of the descendants of Lot, to which was added, “as Israel did unto the land of his possession,”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">51. Cf. above n. 39.</i> as well as, “not for thy righteousness … but for the wickedness of these nations …”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">52. In commenting on Isa. 53:4-5 (AK I 167-8), which says, “we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted, but he was wounded because of our transgressions …” Kaspi says that the meaning is that the nations who afflicted Israel would themselves realize that they could not hide behind the excuse that they were merely the tools of God to punish the Jews. This realization would come to them when they were themselves defeated. Kaspi develops this idea by referring to several of the verses quoted here.</i>
As a rule, in these matters of victors and vanquished—or, if you will, “destroyers” and “destroyed,” for such is the case with the sword and warfare—Scripture will sometimes explain the cause from the point of view of the defeated, and sometimes from the point of view of the victor. From the point of view of the vanquished, (we find) “for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full,”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">53. Gen. 15:16.</i> while from the point of view of the victor, (we find) that Ezekiel said of the destruction of the land of Israel: “a ruin, a ruin, a ruin, will I make it; this also shall be until he come, whose right it is, and I will give it him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">54. Ezek. 21:32.</i> It is always like this. But why should we seek for reasons other than what is written in the Torah in this regard, for Moses said to Israel that they were not more righteous than the Canaanites to the extent that they could justify the victory and the destruction of the Canaanites, with the inheritance of their land, purely on account of (the righteousness of the Israelites).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">55. Deut. 9:5, “Not for thy righteousness … dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations …”</i> The proof is that He did the same for the descendants of Lot who conquered other lands.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">56. Cf. above n. 39.</i> It was, instead, that the Canaanites had to be destroyed by some executioner, as Isaiah said, “I have created the waster to destroy.”<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">57. Isa. 54:16.</i> Even in the case (of the Canaanites), the Lord found it necessary to lengthen the time allotted to the vanquished, which was “until all the generation of the desert was consumed,”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">58. Num. 32:13.</i> as Maimonides and Ibn Ezra wrote.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">59. Kaspi possibly refers here to the explanation, found both in Ibn Ezra’s comments to Gen. 15:6 and Maimonides’ Commentary to the Mishnah <i>’Eruvin</i> 2:9, that the fourth generation does refer to that of the children of Moses, who indeed inherited the land.</i>
Altogether it is evident from the Torah | that the children of Israel did not at all deserve to destroy the Canaanites, and for this reason, after a period known to the Lord, similar to Ezekiel’s saying of Nebuchadnezzar “until his time come,” which period was immediately following the first beast,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">60. Dan. 7:3-4.</i> that beast destroyed Israel who had been a destroyer. This in general was the case with the succeeding kings of Israel. Accordingly, all this should be clear to the masses as well as the select individuals.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">61. For a discussion of possible reasons why Kaspi included the aforegoing passage in the <i>Gevia’ Kesef,</i> see chapter 2 pp. 74-75, in the context of Christian polemics.</i>
As for what was asked in the place<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">62. Kaspi is referring to <i>Kesef Sigim.</i></i> regarding the story of Balaam, when the Lord permitted him to go to the king of Moab, and later put an angel in the way,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">63. Num. 22:20 ff.; i.e., why did the Lord become angry?</i> the answer is to be found in the words of Plato to his students, when he answered his students, “Let them enter.” This was mentioned by Aristotle in the <i>Sophistical Refutations</i> to say that sometimes one will use an expression that makes an affirmative assertion, which when exaggerated, incredulous, or angry is intended to negate (that assertion).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">64. <i>Sophistical Refutations</i> VII, 106, 260a. Kaspi quotes this passage again in <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 163) to say that Balaam should have recognized God’s anger in permitting him to leave.</i> This, however, cannot be sensed from the written word—as Rabbeinu Jonah commented on “and offer him there for a burnt-offering,”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">65. A commentary of Rabbeinu Jonah to Genesis is not extant but the gist of his comments appears to follow in the next words of the passage.</i> saying that this (inflection) cannot be discerned from the words (alone) without some comment from the one who commands, or some aspect of what is being commanded. Indeed there are several instances of this in the Prophets, as when Ezekiel said in the name of God, “Go ye, serve every one his idols.”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">66. Ezek. 20:39. On the importance of context to Kaspi’s exegesis, see above p. 71.</i> It was for this reason that our sages said “from scribes and not from books.”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">67. The source of this statement is unknown. Kaspi quotes it again in <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 124) and <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 42), and it is also found in Judah Halevy’s <i>Cusari</i> I:72.</i> In the same way as happened in the incident of Plato, where the outcome indicated the initial intent, so too when the Lord said to Balaam, “go with them,” it was an assertion that was by way of exaggeration and anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">68. Rashi ad loc. also comments that God’s anger was occasioned by the fact that even though Balaam saw that God did not really want him to go, he went nonetheless.</i>
All this is clear to the philosophers, while Moses taught us this wonderful esoteric doctrine by the way in which he related this story of Balaam.
I have already said that Maimonides, in the final chapter of the second part (of the <i>Guide</i>), explained that everything is attributed to the Lord as the efficient cause.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">69. <i>Guide</i> II:48, cf. above p. 46.</i> (In that case) why do we need to be troubled in this matter regarding Balaam, for if we wish (we can say that) he was dreaming, and that he dreamt this (command from the Lord), as when today such things happen to us on occasion? The fine and precise meaning here, however, is that He who gave the Torah wrote all this,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">70. These vague words might mean that even though it is not clear that God did indeed say these things to Balaam, or that Balaam acted in this way, one thing is certain, and that is that God Himself told Moses how to write this episode in such a way that the reader should come to the conclusion that the entire episode took place as it is literally described.</i> as I explained the meaning of the statement that the episode of Balaam, in making up the totality of the pericope <i>Balak,</i> only tells part of the episode.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">71. Perhaps he means to say that not all the details of the episode are recorded—consequently any conclusions as to whether the event happened as described must be tentative in nature.</i>
As for what I considered there in the matter of Moses, | know that it was indeed so,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">72. Again the reference is to <i>Kesef Sigim,</i> where the question was probably: In Exod. 4:20-26 it appears that the Lord is angry with Moses for going back to Egypt, and punishes him with sickness—does this not contradict the fact that it was the Lord Himself who had commanded Moses to return, as recorded in the preceding chapters?</i> for the Lord being the prime mover of everything, and Moses’ power of prophecy and perception being so immediate, (one can say) that the Lord was the first cause of Moses’ making the move to go to Egypt to take the children of Israel out, even though it is said in the framework of natural causation.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">73. He means that the description of Moses’ departure from Egypt uses language that omits any reference to divine causation; thus “And Moses took … and set them … and returned to the land of Egypt…” (Exod. 4:20).</i>
The final command made to Moses by the Lord, stating “The Lord said unto Moses in Midian: ‘Go, return into Egypt, for all the men are dead that sought thy life,’”<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">74. Exod. 4:19.</i> was said<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">75. Kaspi here is referring to the problem, noticed by Ibn Ezra in his comments on this verse, that the verse is out of place, and should come in the earlier vision of the burning bush.</i> to reinforce and reiterate (what had preceded) at the end of the vision of the burning bush, for between that and this<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">76. He means that between the time of the vision of the burning bush and Moses’ departure, that person had died.</i> the original Pharaoh, or one or another of his servants of whom Moses had to be afraid on account of the killing of the Egyptian, had died.
Adjacent to that is the verse “and Moses took his wife and sons and set them upon an ass”<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">77. Exod. 4:20.</i> —now who commanded him (to do) this? In truth it was his imaginative faculty,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">78. Kaspi deals with the effects of the imaginative faculty later in chap. XX. See also above pp. 114 ff. The present passage does not necessarily contradict Kaspi’s earlier statement (above chap. III, p. 141, and chap. XIII, p. 209) that the imaginative faculty was not operative in the case of Moses, for Kaspi states elsewhere (<i>Maskiyyot Kesef,</i> AM 47) that at the time of these events, Moses had not yet reached to full maturity of his intellectual and prophetic faculties.</i> i.e., his love for his wife and children, that induced him to do this—not the intellectual or prophetic faculty. It was to this (act) that our sages referred when they said, “We have regrets regarding our ancestors.”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">79. <i>Mekhilta</i> ’ Jethro, chap. 1.</i>
This was not at all a good idea, so that when he came to the inn and laid his head down to sleep, he pondered over the issue,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">80. He means that Moses realized that by taking his wife and children along he had not followed the precise instructions of God, and so he was troubled.</i> either in his wakened state or when asleep. He then made the mental recognition that it had been a bad idea, and became agitated over that error. His intellect became so accusing that his soul was close to death, and he was gripped by trembling, panic, and numbness.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">81. Later in the <i>Gevia’ Kesef,</i> chap. XX, below pp. 266-267, Kaspi says that such symptoms were well known to the physicians of his time.</i> This is all included in the statement that “the Lord met him and sought to kill him,”<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">82. Exod. 4:24.</i> (meaning that all) this passed through the imaginative faculty. (In this regard) one should keep in mind the saying “Yet how wilt thou do in the thickets of the Jordan,”<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">83. Jer. 12:5.</i> in the event that I am mistaken in this regard.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">84. What Kaspi means is to be found in the light of Kimḥi’s explanation of the verse, which has God asking Jeremiah how he could possibly understand God’s ways if he has difficulty in understanding human behavior. Kaspi invokes the verse to show the difficulty of fathoming the precise meaning of Moses’ behavior and the passage in general.</i> (In any case) Moses had a very powerful attack of sickness, such as <i>febris ephemeralis,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">85. Maimonides’ <i>Pirḳei Moshe,</i> ed. S. Muntner (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1959). p. 64.</i> which is a kind of daytime fever. Therefore Zipporah, whether on her own or at Moses’ command, acted in a way that was a known omen among them, by sprinkling blood on him, particularly on his feet. The reason was that they believed that blood restores nature, especially for one like Moses, of whom it is said, “he is trusted in all my house.”<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">86. Num. 12:7; i.e., Moses was more conducive to divine providence. Cf. <i>Guide</i> III:17, where the idea is developed that individual providence “is consequent upon the intellect and attached to it.” The text of the <i>Gevia’</i> in the following sentence appears to be corrupt, and quite untranslatable.</i> This omen healed Moses…. Proof of this is the act whereby they sprinkled on their doorposts<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">87. Exod. 12:21.</i> to ward off the effects of the imaginative faculty of the Israelites when they would hear the (cries) of Egypt at the death of the firstborn. It is the same in regard to the leper.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">88. Lev. 14:7. Part of the purification of the leper was to sprinkle blood upon him, which Kaspi maintains was for the benefit of his imaginative faculty, blood being an omen of life and health.</i>
Zipporah could not find an organ that was immediately available, other than her son’s foreskin.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">89. Kaspi apparently does not accept the idea (cf. Rashi and Ibn Ezra on Exod. 4:24) that Moses had omitted to circumcise his newborn son—the baby was circumcised, but a small residue of skin remained to be conveniently used by Zipporah.</i> One does not have to say that he was not circumcised,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">90. Cf. above n. 89.</i> for even the part remaining (after the circumcision) on the baby is called “the foreskin” or “of the foreskin.”
All these are precious matters. The contents of this chapter are all necessary to answer the eighteenth question in <i>Kesef Sigim.</i>

Chapter 16

As for the answer to the nineteenth question, I have already stated the answer to the first doubt, while the answer of the second (doubt) was answered in my <i>Maṣref | La-Kesef,</i> for it was there that I discussed the issue of excision.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. From Kaspi’s statements in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 53-54), in commenting on “the uncircumcised male shall be cut off from his people” (Gen. 17:14), as told to Abraham in the second vision, we can reconstruct the second doubt mentioned here. In his comments there he refers to the Christians, who argue against the punishment of a baby for not being circumcised, as a baby is not in a position to do anything about it. Kaspi’s answer is that the punishment is directed only at one who permits himself to continue uncircumcised even having reached adulthood. Consequently the doubt here is: Why punish an uncircumcised baby for something beyond his control?</i> As for the rest of the answers to the remaining doubts, what I wrote earlier in explaining that vision suffices, when put together with the explanation of its terms and general purposes as written in (<i>Maṣref</i>) <i>La-Kesef</i> and <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i>.

Chapter 17

As for the solution to the twentieth question, know that by way of answering the first (doubt),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. From what follows, the doubt appears to be as follows: In Gen. 18:1, at the visit of the three men, why was it necessary to specify the exact place and time that the vision occurred?</i> whenever any prophet, with the exception of Moses, experiences prophecy, there are several necessary limits, which include, among others, spatial and temporal factors. This is found in all the prophets, including the Account of the Chariot in Ezekiel.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Ezek. 1:1, “… as I was among the captives by the river Chebar …”; i.e., the physical factors must be conducive to prophetic inspiration.</i> Maimonides, as well as the sages who speculate,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. In Heb. <i>ḥakhmei ha-’iyyun,</i> a term usually referring to the gentile philosophers.</i> alluded to this, as can be seen in their investigations.
For this reason, He who gave the Torah indicated in the present situation regarding Abraham, by way of parable and metaphor, that (Abraham was situated in) “the terebinths of Mamre.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Gen. 18:1.</i> He also said that “he sat,” for had he been moving around he would not have been mentally composed in either intellectual or prophetic (speculation). He would certainly not have dozed unless he was seated.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. On the implications of this statement, see above chap. XIII, n. 14.</i> Sleep is a necessity for prophets.
The fact that at that time it was “in the heat of the day” was also helpful, for the midday sleep was then. I have already discussed most of this above, including the answers to the (second), the fourth, and the fifth doubts.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. The first, fourth, and fifth doubts are referred by Kaspi to other works (cf. above n. 1), and the third is taken up in what follows, so it would appear that the second is referred to in this phrase, even though the MS is unclear.</i> This will suffice for those who understand what I wrote in the chapter dealing specifically with Abraham’s third vision.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Cf. above chap. XIII.</i> What I will write presently refers to the third enumerated doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. From what follows it appears that the question was: Why does Abraham choose the particular numbers that he does in arguing the fate of Sodom before God, starting with fifty and ending with ten? (Gen. 18:23 ff.).</i>
These numbers vary for the same reasons as those mentioned by Maimonides regarding the numbers involved in the sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. <i>Guide</i> III:26, where Maimonides says that the numbers specified in the Torah with regard to sacrifices do not possess any particular significance, for “one particular number had necessarily to be chosen.”</i> This is especially true of Abraham’s starting with the number fifty, which was convenient on account of its being one-half of a hundred. When he concluded with the number ten, it was in accordance with the custom of the Hebrews, such as “more than ten rulers that are in a city”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Eccles. 7:19.</i> and “(am I not better to thee) than ten sons.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. I Sam. 1:8.</i> This is especially in view of the fact that ten constitutes the first aggregate of single numbers,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. A similar statement is made by Al-Batalyawsi in <i>The Book of Intellectual Circles,</i> ed. D. Kaufmann (Berlin, 1880), p. 43.</i> while this number of people can generally make sufficient impression on an audience to have them obey their instruction.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. Kaspi might here be referring to Num. 13, where the ten spies who returned from Canaan were able to sway and influence the masses.</i> Had there been that number (of righteous people) with Lot, (the Sodomites) would have heeded his advice to leave the cities, until that overwhelming storm had passed—instead of (the Sodomites) regarding him as a clown. But what can one person or a few individuals do, when there are many avenues of escape?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. He means that there are alternative avenues to follow, with other leaders impressing them. Kaspi’s words here imply that even had the Sodomites repented, the city would still have been destroyed. This is consistent with Kaspi’s general position regarding the immutability of divine decrees (cf. <i>Maṣref La-Kesef,</i> MK II 286 ff.); i.e., God had decreed that “the city” would be destroyed, but the exact meaning of “the city” would be clarified in the course of time, whether or not the inhabitants fled in repentance. This position of Kaspi reflects Ibn Ezra’s commentary to Exod. 33:21, which attempts to reconcile personal providence with the notion of fate as ordained by the stars. The example that Ibn Ezra uses is that of a city that is destined to be flooded and its inhabitants drowned. A prophet comes and warns them to repent before their fate is sealed; they obey him, repent, and leave the city. In their absence the river rises and floods the city. Thus Ibn Ezra reconciles divine providence with natural law. Kaspi appears to equate a divine decree with natural law in that neither can be changed permanently. For further discussion of this latter issue, see above Chapter 4.</i> (For example) Noah escaped without fleeing to another land, for the flood encompassed a great and broad area, and he was forced to construct an ark. Lot, (however,) as well as those of his household who were obedient to him, and others who were with him by listening to him, went to Zoar.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Gen. 19:20.</i>
…<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. There seems to be an omission in the MS at this point, for not only is there a change to the Book of Jonah, there is also a direct approach to the problem of the immutability of divine decrees, which Kaspi was not addressing up to that point.</i> they escaped from Nineveh, that other “ship,” when everyone young and old went out of Nineveh. There is no doubt that the Lord’s word, | “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. Jon. 3:4.</i> was (nonetheless) fulfilled. Jonah revealed this to us by recording in his book that even after he found out that the Lord withdrew the evil (punishment) once the people repented in subservience, it states, “But it displeased Jonah exceedingly.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Jon. 4:1; what is implied here is that Jonah was displeased because he saw that the city was still going to be destroyed. Alternatively one can explain that Jonah was angry that the nations of the world would consider him a false prophet once the decree that he had announced did not come to pass (cf. Rashi ad loc.).</i> The purpose (of the decree) had been for the (people of Nineveh) to fear their fate as spoken by the prophet of the Lord, and (in fact) they did not harden their heart, as had the Egyptians, and as a result they all fled an undisclosed distance from the city. When Jonah wrote for us, “Then Jonah went out of the city till he might see what would become of the city,”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Jon. 4:5.</i> he revealed something else, for once he knew, as he tells us he did, that the Lord had withdrawn the evil (punishment), why would he go out? And why (does it say), “to see what would become of it”?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. The question is: Once Jonah knew that God had withdrawn his decree of punishment, why did Jonah even consider the possibility that something untoward might happen to the city?</i>
(The answer is that) he was still in some doubt regarding the decree’s statement that “yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,” (whether its mode be) necessary or contingent.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. This distinction is discussed by Kaspi earlier in the <i>Gevia’ Kesef,</i> in chap. IX, above pp. 187-188.</i> For according to Hebrew, as well as the vernacular, it is known that when one says “city” or “land,” one can have reference to the land or the city as separate from their inhabitants, or (else) be referring to their inhabitants (alone) without (the land or city). One could also be referring to them all. Now Jonah saw that at least the inhabitants were escaping, so finally his doubt as to the sin of the city was resolved,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. He means that Jonah realized that “Nineveh” in the decree had referred to the city environs and not to the inhabitants thereof, at least not in the same way. In what follows he develops this further.</i> and he left it. In any case he desired to see the act of the Lord in destroying it, to know whether it would be similar to the destruction of Sodom (with) fire, brimstone, and salt<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Cf. Gen. 19:24.</i> —or (whether it would be) with fire alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. Kimḥi, in his commentary to Jonah, explains that he left the city in the event that the people faltered in their repentance, in which case God might have determined once more to destroy the city. According to Kimḥi, the city was in fact not destroyed, whereas according to Kaspi it was.</i>
Thus it became evident to Jonah, on the basis of several considerations, that the original decree, stating, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,” which might have referred to both the city and its inhabitants, undoubtedly did refer (to them both), but (in different ways, for) the execution of the decree on the city was necessary, while what had been intended for its inhabitants was contingent, for that was how it happened.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. A similar, abbreviated answer is found in <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 288). Kaspi’s contention that the city was indeed destroyed would conveniently explain the problem bothering all the commentators: Why was Jonah so angry and resentful? Kaspi would explain that Jonah wanted to save the city as well.</i>
Consequently there was no change in the will expressed by the word of the Lord in this instance, or in that of his prophet. This was even though the inhabitants of Nineveh escaped from off that land, as I will further explain in its proper place.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. This might be a reference to the <i>Neḳudot Kesef</i> or <i>Keforei Kesef,</i> on which see above p. 19.</i>
David similarly escaped the sword of Saul and Absalom. It was in reference to this that Solomon said, “he by his wisdom delivered the city.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. Eccles. 9:15.</i> What he was saying was that an individual (can save a city) either by the submission of the inhabitants of the city to his counsel, or because they are the kind of people to listen to the counsel of the wise, or else because his worth, on account of his wisdom, makes him great in their eyes. Jeremiah said of such a person, “if ye can find a man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. Jer. 5:1.</i> In truth, were we to describe such a one, i.e., one who inspires faith, he would be Zedekiah. For he was the king who vigorously withstood Jeremiah’s advice to “bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. Jer. 27:12.</i> And so it was that in the domain of the city of Jerusalem, and the Temple with all its inhabitants, no one went out at all, neither did they construct an ark, as did Noah, or something similar (to help them escape).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. As a result of his opposition to Jeremiah’s counsel to submit, the city was finally taken by force, the king was taken captive, and the city destroyed, as related in Jer. 39.</i>
| In general (therefore) the leader of the people is to be equated with the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. He means that the leader’s will generally prevails over that of the people, either by force or by reason of the respect that he inspires.</i> Ezekiel was referring to this singular type of person when he said, “I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the breach before me,”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. Ezek. 22:30.</i> to prevent the destruction of Jerusalem. This was something not said of Baruch ben Neriah or his kind, and not even of Jeremiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. He means that they were not leaders of the people as were the rulers and kings.</i> As for what Ezekiel said elsewhere, that three men cannot save a city but only themselves, if they are righteous<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. Ezek. 14:14-16.</i> —that does not contradict (what I have said). For some decrees are necessary, and others are contingent by nature, with the reason in each case depending on the time and place.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. Kaspi discusses this distinction earlier in chap. IX, above pp. 186 ff.</i>
Ezekiel also revealed to us in that place another secret, by explaining the identity of these three who are described. For he neither spoke in general, nondescript terms nor did he identify them as Aaron, Moses, and Samuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. He means that these leaders were not elevated from the masses, neither were they true wise men.</i> He identified them only as Noah, Daniel, and Job.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. “Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness …”</i> Now Noah and Job were kindred of Abel,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. This is explained in chap. VI above p. 160, where Kaspi mentions that Noah, Job, and Abel belong in the same category, all of them having sacrificed to God, a sign that they were not complete in their wisdom. Here too their inadequacy is reflected in their inability to save their respective cities, had the occasion arisen.</i> and as for Daniel, perhaps he too (belonged in their category), for we have no evidence that his (level of prophetic) knowledge was other than a dream faculty,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. He means that Daniel’s visions all occurred in prophetic dreams, which, as Maimonides showed in the <i>Guide</i> (cf. above chap. XIII, pp. 210 ff.) are inferior to those occurring in visions.</i> something which possibly was common to Abel and his kindred. For this reason Daniel was included in the Hagiographa together with Job.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">40. He means that the third section of the bible, i.e., the Hagiographa, was written with a lower level of prophetic inspiration. This reflects Maimonides’ statement (<i>Guide</i> II:45) that “Daniel, Job, and all the other writings have likewise been composed through this kind of Holy Spirit (which constitutes the second degree of prophecy).”</i> (For people such as these) it is enough if they can manage to save themselves, for they do not possess any great wisdom, nor do they command (enough) respect on account of which all the inhabitants of a city or a land can escape.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">41. In this passage Kaspi is in accord with Maimonides’ doctrine of personal providence, as developed in the <i>Guide</i> III: 17-18, that “providence is consequent upon the intellect and attached to it.” Thus those who are more complete in respect to their intellectual faculties are the ones who will be protected most.</i>
The sum of this chapter is the resolution of the entire question numbered twenty in <i>Kesef Sigim,</i> in the shortest way possible to me.

Chapter 18

This is the solution to the twenty-first question. What I wrote earlier in explaining Abraham’s fourth vision,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. The fourth vision, i.e., the binding of Isaac, was dealt with in chap. XIV.</i> (contains) the essential solution to all (the doubts in this question). While it is certainly true that Abraham was a man who was born,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Cf. above chap. VII, p. 164, and chap. VIII, p. 170.</i> there is clearly the possibility that this entire event occurred to him in a dream.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Cf. above chap. XIV, n. 1, which discusses whether or not Kaspi accepted the events of Gen. 22 at face value. In the present chapter, Kaspi appears not to decide either way, i.e., whether they were in a dream or not.</i> Whether or not this took place, Moses in his wisdom wrote this entire anecdote for our benefit, in accordance with the ten purposes that I described earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Kaspi outlined these ten benefits in chap. XIV; see above pp. 218, 232 ff.</i> (Those ten) were all for the benefit of us, the children of Israel, we who received the Torah and study it continuously.
In addition to this (consideration),<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Kaspi now says that even if one accepted the proposition that the events of Gen. 22 only occurred in a dream, one could still explain the terms in that chapter, which indicate that these events happened in a material sense so as to conform to their happening in the dream.</i> every (expression in the story of the binding of Isaac) is true, and accords with logic and the conventions of the Hebrew language.
Thus he said “did prove” and “for now I know” by way of “the Torah speaks in the language of men” in accordance with Ibn Ezra’s explanation of “it repented the Lord that He had made man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Gen. 6:6. The question posed is that “did prove” and “now I know” imply that the events happened in a material sense. Kaspi’s answer is that these expressions were used in accordance with Abraham’s understanding of the matter, i.e., he thought that God was testing him in order to know whether he was God-fearing. Ibn Ezra’s interpretation of “the Torah speaks in the language of men” and Kaspi’s elaboration thereof, is discussed above pp. 57 ff.</i> For it is customary for people to say of a man who destroyed what he built, that “he repented having built …” This is certainly true if we know what Maimonides said in addition when he explained that statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. <i>Guide</i> I:29, “the interpretation of the verse [that ‘it repented the Lord that he had made man’] would be that God was angry with them.”</i> together with my exposition of the special case in which Joshua revealed the secret when he wrote the words “the men pursued after them,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. Josh. 2:7.</i> which I wrote in the <i>Mizraḳ | Kesef.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. This work is not extant, but in <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> (AK I 2) Kaspi refers to the doctrine, first found in Ibn Ezra, that the verse should be understood as saying, “the men thought they were pursuing after them,” which is a case of “the Torah speaks in the language of men”; cf. above p. 58.</i>
Because the Torah was given to the masses at large, its author was forced to write terms and statements that accorded with their thinking, and that were suited to their beliefs and follies, for their own good. Now it is their accepted opinion that the Lord tests, and that He will know at a point in the future what He did not know previously. (Consequently) He who wrote the Torah was forced to permit them to retain some anthropomorphic beliefs. The one who practiced this to an extreme was Avicenna,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Likewise in <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> (AK I 124) he says that Avicenna believed “that it is not proper to reveal to the masses that God is not corporeal.” Kaspi’s own preference is for a position similar to that of Averroës, whom Kaspi understood to have said that one should attempt to impart such truths, but to be most discriminating in the process, lest the masses lose their belief in God altogether. Cf. above p. 29.</i> but not, heaven forbid, Moses. Thus it is certainly correct to write “did prove” and “for now I know” and to attribute this to the Lord, for He was in one sense the distant mover of all this, Abraham being the immediate (mover).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. He means that by commanding Abraham to do this, God was in effect the distant mover and cause of Abraham’s actions. Accordingly the term <i>nissah,</i> being the <i>pi‘el</i> stem, is to be understood as a causative, i.e., “God caused Abraham to prove.”</i> This was one of the reasons for saying “and God did prove,” for that was a precise allusion to Abraham himself, or to his imaginative faculty and his nature,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. He means that Abraham was moved by his imaginative and other faculties to respond in the way that he did, whether awake or in a dream. Kaspi singles out the imaginative faculty as motivating Abraham, for as he pointed out in chap. XIV, sacrifice in general, and child-sacrifice in particular, is to be associated with the imaginative faculty, so Abraham, in attempting to fulfill God’s will, was acting in accord with that faculty.</i> which was the origin and cause of his action. This accords with the recorded definition of “nature” and “natural force.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. This might allude to Kaspi’s oft-stated position (see above chap. IX, p. 172) that nature can be viewed as being only an extension of God’s distant causation of events, or else as having an independent causative action. This reflects Maimonides’ position in the <i>Guide</i> II:48.</i>
As for the phrase “offer him there for a burnt-offering,” there can be no doubt,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. The doubt that is contemplated is that this command of God would appear to be contradicted by the later command to desist, in v. 12, and that if so, there would appear to be a change in God’s words and decree. This would countervene Kaspi’s contention that God’s word is never changed.</i> for in the Hebrew language as well as in logic, every expression of movement does not necessarily refer to the consummation of the act. Sometimes the reference will be to a middle, beginning, or even prior to the beginning, on account of its being a proximate or distant potential.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Accordingly, the original command was the equivalent of saying, “begin to offer him there for a burnt-offering …” which was indeed fulfilled by Abraham and not countervened by the angel of the Lord.</i> Thus, for example, we can say of “the child that will be born”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Judg. 13:8.</i> that it writes, eats, is a prophet, or is wise—by virtue of it’s being in potential. As a rule, every adjective and verb will occasionally modify what exists in potential, as they do what is actual, for the term <i>nimṣa’</i> (“exist”) and <i>hayah</i> (“be”) are ascribed to everything, whether actual or potential.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. A similar point was made by Kaspi earlier in the work (chap. X, p. 200), in reference to the use of future and past tenses in Hebrew, which Kaspi believes reflects the Aristotelian doctrine of actuality and potentiality. Here Kaspi extends his observations to include the injunctive form; i.e., a command to act may only be a command to create the potential for that act. See also above pp. 49 ff.</i> Furthermore, what exists (in actuality) only in the soul (is to be considered) as if existing outside of it as well. So, too, what exists only as the spoken word, (is to be considered) as if existing outside the soul. Proof are the words of the writer of the Torah, who, when he wrote, “I was restored unto mine office and he was hanged,”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Gen. 41:13.</i> revealed (this truth), for that had only existed as the spoken word.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. What Kaspi means is that the verse implies that the chief butler considered Joseph to have caused the baker to be hung and the butler to be reinstated. Such an opinion is referred to by Ibn Ezra in his comments on this verse. According to such an approach, what existed only in potential was already actualized in Joseph’s mind. This accords with Kaspi’s statement (<i>Maṣref La-Kesef,</i> MK II 90) that what exists in the mind is no less than what exists outside of it, while speech, too, confers existence upon that of which it speaks.</i> He also wrote that Jacob said, “which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow,”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Gen. 48:22. In the <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 104) Kaspi says that this verse will be explained in the <i>Gevia‘ Kesef.</i></i> which was (only) potential.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. He means that even though this was only to be realized at some future time, in Jacob’s mind it was realized and actualized already, and for this reason Jacob spoke of it in the past tense. Ibn Ezra’s commentary to that verse records a similar interpretation.</i> He further wrote, regarding Jeremiah, “and you gave them wine to drink,”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. Jer. 35:2, which the JPS translation has, “and give them wine to drink,” but in Heb. <i>ve-hishḳita.</i></i> (even though) it was still in potential and close to realization. In the context of Jeremiah it is written, regarding the unspoken and spoken word, “See, I have set thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root and to pull down, and to destroy and to overthrow; to build and to plant,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Jer. 1:10.</i> i.e., that the villages and the houses (would be destroyed by Jeremiah) by hand, but not rebuilt by (Jeremiah’s) hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. He means here too that Jeremiah considered those potential events to be already actualized, even though he would do no more than speak to attain those goals.</i> There are several such metaphors in Scripture. All this is true in accordance with true logic. These are logical principles upon which the entire Torah and Prophets depend. As for the rest of this vision, I already dealt with those matters at length.

Chapter 19

As for the solution to the twenty-second question,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. The question deals with the apparent repetitions and redundancies in Scripture, and inquires as to their purpose.</i> I say that Maimonides commented on this in one of the chapters of the third part (of the <i>Guide</i>), the one that begins by saying, | “There are also things which belong to the mysteries of the Torah which have caused many people to stumble.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. <i>Guide</i> III:50.</i> He went on to provide an explanation and reason why each (was included in the Torah). It was for that reason that I composed the <i>Ṭirat Kesef,</i> in order to explain the purposes of the stories (in the Torah), all of which are categorical statements known as <i>’imrah</i> (“affirmation”), in the same way that Maimonides explained the purposes of the commandments, all of which are noncategorical statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Maimonides, in the <i>Guide</i> III:25-50, provides a detailed rationale of the commandments of the Torah. Kaspi’s reference to the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> as intended to explain the purposes of the narratives in the Torah is consistent with the description in the <i>Ḳevuṣat Kesef.</i> On the distinction between categorical and noncategorical statements, see <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 1-2).</i>
What I will write here relates to the issue of the excessive length (of those stories), as well as their repetitiveness. Excessive length in any description that might be, is necessary for the masses, in that one of the purposes of the Torah is that it be accessible to the mass of women and children, as I have written. Now while it is true that the singular individuals can be satisfied with abbreviated terminology, this is not the case with the masses, for nothing will make an impression on them unless there is a lengthy description.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. In the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 110) he says that “through repetition one’s memory is reinforced, and one’s impression is deepened.”</i> For this reason it was necessary (for the Torah) to dwell at length on the subject of curses and blessings, particularly when (Moses) died, (and the prolixity extended) to cover all of Deuteronomy.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. As Kaspi explains in the next chapter, the blessings and curses in the Torah are for the benefit of the masses, who should believe in their efficacy. Deuteronomy, with its surfeit of blessings and curses (cf. Deut. 27 ff.), was therefore perceived by Kaspi as intended for the masses.</i> In addition to reiterating for their sake, (Moses) repeated several things for the benefit of us who read the Torah today. Thus he said “a copy of this law,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Deut. 17:18, lit. “a second Torah.”</i> intending us to read some things in the Book of Exodus in the wintertime, and to repeat them when we read the Book of Deuteronomy in the summer.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. According to the rabbinic division of the Torah into fifty-four portions, approximately parallel to the number of Sabbaths, Exodus is read in the winter and Deuteronomy in the summer, with the result that the readings are equally spaced for maximum impact.</i> In spite of this, (those things) are not impressed on our hearts.
This is illustrated when Isaiah, in rebuking the masses of women, began by saying, “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. Isa. 3:16.</i> and continued to mention many of their specific ornaments. Now it would have sufficed for the wise had he said, “they multiplied their ornaments.” The prophets did this many times, having learnt it from the Torah.
In addition, repetition and duplication indicate that something is established and overpowering, as in the threefold repetition of “a ruin, a ruin, a ruin, will I make it,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Ezek. 21:32.</i> and many others like it. This purpose was pointed out by Him who gave the Torah most notably in the case of Joseph, who told Pharaoh, “For that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Gen. 41:32.</i> Other instances should be compared to this statement.
Moses was particularly prolix with regard to the sacrifices of the oxen at the festival of Tabernacles,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Num. 7:1-83, where the identical sacrifices brought by each of twelve princes at the dedication of the Tabernacle are repeated verbatim twelve times.</i> and of the princes<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Num. 29:12-39.</i> —to an extreme point. The reason for that is that the Torah is divided into five books and then into paragraphs, some of which are intended exclusively for the masses.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. Cf. above chap. VIII, p. 170, where Kaspi explains that Genesis is intended primarily for the select individuals, whereas the later portions are for the masses.</i> The reason for this is that the Torah was to be handed to the masses (as well as) the singular individuals, which are opposites. So it was necessary to write some things exclusively for the select few, | and some things exclusively for the masses. The part that is intended for “the individuals of truth” relates to the subjects of the Account of Creation and the Account of the Chariot.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. These two “accounts” correspond to the Aristotelian categories of Physics and Metaphysics respectively. See L. Strauss, <i>Persecution and the Art of Writing</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), pp. 38 ff.</i> This includes most of Genesis. The part that is exclusively for the masses includes most of Leviticus, which is mostly sacrifices and related things that include all the sacrificial rites. Sacrifice was one of the most necessary practices for the masses to be able to rely on its performance, just as the select few rely on intellectual truths. For this reason Moses impressed this act upon their hearts,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. This reflects Kaspi’s earlier comments that sacrifices are only for the benefit of the masses, who need to perform such ceremonies. Cf. chap. VI.</i> by describing the sacrifices of the princes at length. Thus, while they were all of a kind, he recorded the sacrifice twelve complete times—whereas had this been a matter concerning the select few, it would have sufficed to write the procedure followed by the first prince, and then said, “and thus did each one.” That would have been the same as in the case of the six branches of the candelabra,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Exod. 25:33, “so for the six branches going out of the candlestick …”</i> which was written for intellectual purposes.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 103 ff.), while explaining the Temple as a microcosm reflecting the macrocosm of the universe, Kaspi explains that the candelabra represents the six Separate Intelligences, which are beyond man’s comprehension.</i> Even some of the popular subjects used such methods, such as “and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother,”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Deut. 23:3, which does not repeat all the possible objects that might be lost.</i> for the Torah customarily uses analogy based on specific example, which is known as a principle of logic.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. This refers to the third of the thirteen rules of Talmudic hermeneutics, as formulated by Rabbi Ishmael (in the introduction to the <i>Sifra’</i>), which states that “a general principle [<i>binyan ’av</i>], as contained in one or two Biblical laws, is applicable to all related laws.”</i> Thus, the Torah will mention a specific instance or one component, and will then make a generalizing statement, and if that is not done (explicitly), then it will be implied. (Such a case is) that which is written in the Torah, “thou shall make a parapet for thy roof,”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Deut. 22:8, and MT <i>Roṣe’aḥ</i> 11:4.</i> which Maimonides explained as being a generic commandment (encompassing) the removal of every obstacle from one’s house, every stone that abuts, every nail on the ground, as well as whatever is similar to this.
So the reason for the lengthy repetition time and again, which is again summarized and totaled species by species,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. Num. 7:84-88 provides the aggregate of all the twelve days of sacrifice.</i> as it appears in the sacrifices of the princes, (has as its purpose) to impress upon the masses how great people should offer gifts and donations to the Lord, and by extension so should every person. Now the princes brought exceedingly large gifts (to be sacrificed), but when Moses saw that they were approaching simultaneously to sacrifice the six covered wagons and the rest, he knew that it would not make as great an impression on the masses who were looking on as would be the case were they to do it over a period of days. For that reason he commanded them to bring their sacrifices during twelve days, so that one prince each day would bring his sacrifices to the dedication of the altar. Thus the Israelite masses would gather day after day for twelve days to see this (spectacle).
Now in the same way that we who see the twelvefold | repetition of each paragraph are so deeply impressed, so that even though we might not absorb the description of the six covered wagons when we see it in Scripture or hear it once a year being read, we would (certainly) absorb those sacrifices that are read and heard twelve times,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. The description of the six covered wagons precedes the enumeration of the twelve days of sacrifice.</i> so too with the bullocks of the festival of Tabernacles. The reason is that He who gave the Torah was forced to have the masses believe that sacrifice is cherished by God, as the masses do indeed believe. All the nations also (believe this). Thus, in accord with the thinking of the masses, He said, “for a sweet savor unto the Lord,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Num. 29:36.</i> as well as, “the Lord smelled the sweet savor,” which are like “and the men pursued after them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. He means that these verse are to be understood according to “the Torah speaks in the language of men.”</i> The same is the case with the other rites ascribed (as desirable) to the Lord. Now notice how careful Moses was, for while he wrote at excessive length on the issue of sacrifice, so as to arouse the masses to life, (when he came to) what was intended for the select few, he used an abbreviated style, suppressed into one verse. This is in connection with “When Moses went into the tent of meeting that he might speak with him, then he heard the voice speaking unto him from above the ark-cover that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim; and He spoke unto him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. Num. 7:89, which follows upon the lengthy preceding passage depicting the twelve days of sacrifice by the princes.</i> The Men of the Great Assembly were likewise careful to make this verse the final one of the weekly pericope.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. This verse concludes the weekly portion <i>Naso’.</i> Kaspi attached much importance to these divisions of the Torah—see above Chapter 2.</i> This is all as if Scripture, or Moses who wrote it, said that the mass of princes went to extremes in bringing sacrifices, gifts, and offerings at the tent of meeting, whereas Moses, who was the greatest prince, brought no gifts at all. It was not that this was an affront, as happened to the wicked men as recounted at the beginning of the Book of (Samuel),<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. The MS has “Saul,” quite evidently an error, as the reference is clearly to I Sam. 2:11-18, which describes the rapacity of Eli’s two sons in taking of the offerings brought to the Temple.</i> but rather that he performed something more acceptable and preferred by the Lord, and that was intellectual speculation and cleaving to Him.
Notice the careful formulation of “that he might speak with him,” for that alludes to Moses (speaking to) himself, as God is not mentioned previously as the referent (of “he”).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. He means that the pronoun “he” should refer to Moses, for God had not been mentioned in the immediately preceding verses. Thus Moses went in to speak to his own soul; i.e., to meditate in prophetic seclusion.</i> But Moses was speaking with himself, and with his essence, i.e., his intellect.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. This is not the only place that Kaspi appears to substitute the human intellect of a man like Moses for the presence of God. Elsewhere (<i>’Ammudei Kesef,</i> AM 98) he says that “if we establish our intellect <i>in actu,</i> we bring God into our head, for the intellect is God, and God is the intellect…. the most complete person achieves the level of Moses, for God was in his head always to the greatest possible extent …” A similar phenomenon is apparently what Kaspi has in mind in the present passage.</i> The “voice” refers to the intellectual overflow.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. He means that while Moses was meditating in seclusion, an overflow of prophetic inspiration descended upon him. This alludes to the doctrine outlined in the <i>Guide</i> II:36, as well as above chap. VII.</i> This is all understood by the wise.
There is, however, another observation on the isue of the repetition of anecdotes that involve changes in expression and words, such as the story of Eliezer and the story of the dream of Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. In Gen. 24 Eliezer repeats, with small changes, the events that had occurred previously, as described in the Torah. In Gen. 41:1-24 Pharaoh’s dreams are first described as they happened, and then as they were related by Pharaoh, with small changes.</i> Easy subject matter is to be taken as metaphorical and analogous to more difficult matters, as the sages said, “Extrapolate from the explicit to the implicit,”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. BT <i>Yoma</i> 59a.</i> which is also what all the philosophers usually say. Now Moses in the Torah on several occasions repeats things with small changes, especially | in Deuteronomy.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. He means that by learning to be precise in these stories in Genesis, one is able to be similarly precise in the matters of faith as outlined in the repeated passages in Deuteronomy.</i>
The most remarkable of all, for the masses, are the changes appearing in the Ten Commandments, that being the best known, as the occasion when the Lord Himself came down on the mountain and spoke, like a king of flesh and blood. (The changes in the two accounts) teach us that that was not the case. This was certainly true of the (command to keep) the Sabbath, for in the portion of <i>Jethro</i> there is one final cause that is mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. Exod. 20:8, “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.”</i> whereas there is another in <i>Va’et’ḥanan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. Deut., 5:12, “Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy.”</i> (The answer is that) “the ordinances of the Lord are true, they are righteous altogether,”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. Ps. 19:10; i.e., they are consistent, and must be taken together.</i> and therefore in both cases Moses was the immediate speaker, while God Himself, while also speaking, stood from afar. Our sages of blessed memory pointed this out by saying, “‘Remember’ and ‘observe’ were both spoken in one utterance,”<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. BT <i>Rosh Ha-Shanah</i> 27a, <i>Shevu’ot</i> 20b.</i> where because “utterance” is a genus that includes both the spoken and unspoken word, their statement is also true of the spoken words, as “remember” and “observe” are synonymous.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. What he means, possibly, is that both terms convey only one idea, and as such they were spoken as “one.”</i> This is like someone who says today, “The wine is good,” and tomorrow says, “The port is good.” Their statement is certainly true of the unspoken word, for the mental representation is one,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. In Heb. <i>‘inyan ha-maḥshavi ’eḥad.</i></i> so that the two purposes that are enunciated with regard to the Sabbath as being “in one utterance” were (meant to refer to) the unspoken word.

Chapter 20

As for the solution to the twenty-third question,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. From the passage that follows, it appears that the question inquired what effect blessings or curses could possibly have on the well-being of the recipient, for reason would indicate that the Torah bestows rewards and punishments according to what is deserved, and not according to any verbal pronouncements that might be made. If so, why does the Torah enumerate and emphasize the events surrounding blessings and curses?</i> it is thus: know that it is necessary for the masses to believe in general that in regard to blessings and curses, a blessing will bring about some good, while a curse will cause harm.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Kaspi’s answer is that actually verbal pronouncements of blessing and curse have no objective effect that in some metaphysical way affects the fortunes of a recipient—instead such pronouncements have other benefits that are of a political nature. It is only a mistaken belief of the masses that there is some metaphysical effect of a blessing or a curse.</i> This is certainly (to be believed if that blessing or curse issues) from the mouths of the zealous and favored of the Lord. It is the same today, for this (popular belief) effects for the masses the two necessary and well-known purposes enumerated by Maimonides in the <i>Introduction to the Mishnah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Maimonides, <i>Introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah,</i> ed. M. D. Rabinowitz (Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1964), pp. 79 ff.</i> </i>These (purposes) are to provide company and service for one who is perfect in his knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Maimonides states this as: “to make a society for the wise so that they not remain isolated … [the wise) would have had to learn the arts of ploughing, reaping, winnowing, and sowing … so when would they have had the opportunity to acquire wisdom?”</i>
Thus it is altogether necessary to establish a firm belief in the benefits of blessings and the harmful effects of curses, in the imagination of the masses. (They are to believe this) especially in those instances where distinctive configurations are used, such as those that we utilize today that involve excommunication, and even more so the bed and horns.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. <i>Rabad,</i> in his strictures to Maimonides’ <i>Mishneh Torah, Hil. Shevuot</i> 11:13, similarly refers to the Geonic practice of excommunication accompanied by horns, extinguished candles, and overturned beds, all intended to overwhelm those present. These and similar practices, as carried out by the Geonim, are documented in S. Assaf, <i>Ha-‘Onshin Aḥar Ḥatimat Ha-Talmud</i> (Jerusalem, 1922), pp. 32 ff. On the use of such customs as an aid in Kaspi’s exegesis, see above Chapter 2 and chap. VI, n. 6. The present instance is consistent with Kaspi’s insistence (cf. <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> AK 152) that prophetic actions were designed so as to have maximum impact on the masses.</i> It was particularly for this reason that Moses instituted “these shall stand … to bless … and these shall stand … to curse …”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Deut. 27:12.</i> And therefore Moses preceded (that ceremony by stating) in Genesis—which related past events—that God Himself blessed some of His creatures and cursed others.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Gen. 1:3 et al.</i> After that (Moses relates that) Noah cursed Canaan and blessed his other sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. Gen. 9:25.</i> Moses similarly spoke at length of the rivalry of Jacob and Esau to receive the blessing of their zealous father, Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Gen. 25:29 ff.</i> (In regard to that incident<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Here Kaspi appears to direct these parenthetic remarks to contemporary allegorists (see Chapter 2) who attempted to explain certain patriarchal narratives as more symbolic than real. The narrative of the blessing of Jacob at the expense of Esau, with its moral problems and issues, would have been a likely candidate for such allegorical interpretation.</i>) if the truth be that Esau and Jacob never existed, then neither did Moses and Aaron, and if Rebecca (likewise did not exist), then neither did Miriam exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. Regarding Job, Kaspi makes a similar assertion when he says (AS I 137): “The verse says, ‘there was a man in the land of Uz …’; accordingly, how could the early and late commentators doubt that he existed,” for one would then have to doubt the existence of all the personalities in the Bible.</i>
It is similarly written that Jacob blessed his children<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Gen. 49.</i> when he died, as did Moses when he died.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. Deut. 33:1 ff.</i> As for (what happened) in the story of Balaam,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. The question that is here addressed is: Why did the entire episode involving the thwarting of Balaam’s intention to curse the people have to take place, if according to Kaspi’s earlier contention the mere verbal pronouncement of blessing or curse has no metaphysical effect? Balaam himself declared, “when He hath blessed I cannot call it back” (Num. 23:20)—if so, why did God intercede in the first place?</i> the explanation is clearly that that fool was universally known for the fact that whomever he blessed was blessed, and whomever he cursed was accursed. Consequently Moses was forced to have them believe that (Balaam) had not cursed them but had 154a blessed them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Kaspi’s answer is that in fact there was no metaphysical effect that might have issued from his pronouncements. The reason for God’s precautions was the belief of the Israelite masses that there was just such an effect, and it was that belief itself which was a source of danger, as Kaspi now goes on to explain. For an analysis and discussion of Kaspi’s psychological explanation as articulated here and elsewhere, as well as its roots in Averroëan and Maimonidean thought, see Chapter 4.</i> This is in a manner of | a physician, who is (like any) leader, in that he prevents the onset of disease by the maintenance of good health, and even improving it. Now (in the incident with Balaam), had that mass, including women and children, believed, heaven forbid, that Balaam had cursed them, then the plague would have taken hold of the Israelites. This is because they were affected by their imaginative faculty, whose effect is a matter known even today, as the physicians are most aware.
As for the “devoted thing” of Achan,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. The reference is to Josh. 7:1 ff., where it is related that as a result of a curse, Achan was defeated in battle. Here too the implication is that, contrary to Kaspi’s assertion, such a curse has some metaphysical effect.</i> in my opinion Achan was an officer of the army, for he was from the tribe of Judah,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. “Achan the son of Carmi … of the tribe of Judah” (Josh. 7:1).</i> and (as such) he stood at the head of those three thousand men. Now because he knew in his heart that he had violated the “devoted thing,” his conscience afflicted him as he was fighting, and being frightened that that transgression would trip him up, he fled. When he fled, so did those in his camp, and they were beaten by the men of Ai. Now it is neither necessary nor proper that all (this) be written in the text.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. On the issue of the precision of Scriptural description, see Chapter 2.</i> One should extrapolate from this.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. On several occasions in his writings, Kaspi refers to the incident of Achan as the archetype of the effects of the imaginative faculty. See Chapter 4.</i>
As a rule, those who write Scripture compose the stories to communicate to us the sciences of theoretical and practical philosophy, and out of the necessity of political stability. (Therefore) they write things that are of an accidental nature in such a way that the masses will take them to be of an essential nature, for that is what is necessary for political stability.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. On the issue of what is properly to be imparted to the masses, and what is the attitude of the select few to the masses, see Chapter 4.</i> It is all for the sake of providing company and service for the treasured individual, as Maimonides has written. (In any case) the masses consider accidental causes to be essential causes, and certainly there are places where the opposite (is true). Remember all of this.

Chapter 21

As for the solution to the twenty-fourth question,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. The question, it appears, is why in Gen. 28:12, in the story of the dream of Jacob, the angels are described as “ascending and descending on it,” instead of descending first and then ascending, the abode of angels being in heaven. Cf. Rashi ad loc.</i> it is written in the <i>Menorat Kesef</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 91 ff.), Kaspi explains that the ascending angels represent the “pure-spirited men,” i.e., prophets, as they ascend to the higher worlds of knowledge, while the descending angels represent the divinely appointed angels as they go about their missions in this the lower world. According to that explanation, the answer to the present problem is that the referent of “ascending” is other than that of “descending”; consequently their order is not significant.</i> with the subject having been explicitly (discussed) in the book <i>The Intellectual Circles</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. This work, written by Al-Batalyawsi, had considerable influence on Kaspi. See above Chapter 1, and D. Kaufmann, <i>Die Spuren Al-Batlajusis in der Jüdischen Religionsphilosophie</i> (Berlin, 1880), pp. 46-48. In the above passage of <i>Menorat Kesef,</i> Kaspi asserts that the idea of the ascending ladder representing the three worlds of the universe (on these worlds cf. above chap. I) as enunciated in Batalyawsi’s writings, was originally part of the Judaic heritage, but was stolen by the Greeks during the Second Temple period. The fact is, as A. Altmann has pointed out in “The Ladder of Ascension,” <i>Studies in Mysticism and Religion Presented to G. Scholem</i> (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1967), p. 24, that Kaspi, by identifying this ladder with the Universal Soul as developed in Batalyawsi, was reverting to the Neoplatonic concept of the Universal Soul.</i> For we would be correct to imagine the entire universe as a ladder, whether we begin at the top and descend to the bottom (or we begin at the bottom and ascend to the top).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. These words in the parentheses are not found in the main body of the text, but were inserted in the margin of the MS in another hand. The passage makes better sense if they are included.</i> This is (the meaning of) “going up and coming down,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Gen. 28:12.</i> i.e., “sometimes going up and sometimes coming down.” One should add to this what Maimonides said in two of his writings,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Maimonides, in the <i>Guide</i> I:15, interprets both sets of angels as referring to the prophets, who must first ascend to the throne of glory to apprehend Him who sits on it, and then descend to fulfill His mission in the lower world. In MT <i>The Laws of the Foundations of the Torah</i> 7:3, Maimonides explains that the ladder is a parable that refers to the succession of kingdoms and their destructions.</i> which together are correct. There are in addition as many as seventy interpretations,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Cf. <i>Num. Rabbah</i> 13:15, “there are seventy interpretations of the Torah.”</i> that is to say, seventy plus seventy ad infinitum.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. Earlier (chap. VI, p. 158), Kaspi explains that the number seven “connotes many.” See also <i>Maṣref La-Kesef</i> (MK II 252).</i> Herein, in these profound configurations, is the distinctiveness of the Torah, as Maimonides wrote regarding the equivocal term <i>’avar</i> (“pass”).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. The reference is to the <i>Guide</i> I:21, where Maimonides interprets God’s answer to Moses’ request in Exod. 33 as saying that there are many truths regarding God and His ways which man is incapable of grasping “unless divine help attends him.” Kaspi might see in this phrase an allusion to the Torah as the unique divine help and instrument leading to the comprehension of these secrets.</i> Whoever deals with these things at length is to be most praised, in opposition to (one dealing with) the literal meaning of verses.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. What he means is that in explaining the simple literal meaning of Scripture, brevity is to be preferred over prolixity. This is an oft-repeated theme in Kaspi’s writings.</i>

Chapter 22

| As for the solution to the twenty-fifth question,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. The question is, apparently: How does one establish which prophetic experiences recorded in Scripture occurred exclusively as a vision or dream, and which involved an experience of the external senses?</i> know that Maimonides discussed this at length in the chapters dealing with prophecy,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. Cf. <i>Guide</i> II:46.</i> and asserted that several of them occurred in a dream, by including them among that class of things of which it is impossible that they occurred while (the prophet) was awake. He even said that “this is a thing that can be doubted or not known by him who confuses the possible things with the impossible ones.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Ibid. In that chapter Maimonides insists that every prophetic experience occurred in a vision (or dream) of prophecy—unlike the masses, who think that “they happened in a state in which they could have been perceived by the senses.”</i> Now my opinion is that this is true in certain cases, whereas in other cases I would question (him).
Thus, in the case of Jacob, I admit that the entire narrative of “and Jacob sent messengers”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Gen. 32:4 ff.</i> occurred as something seen in a dream. Nonetheless, in my opinion Jacob carried this out when he awoke, as happened in many such cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Maimonides, in the <i>Guide</i> II:42, asserts that the entire section occurred in a vision, including the preparations for the meeting with Esau (vv. 14-24) and the wrestling with the angel (vv. 25-32). Kaspi, both here and in the <i>Ṭirat Kesef</i> (MK I 22), asserts that the intermediary passage, where Jacob prepared to meet Esau, did occur outside of the prophetic vision.</i> As for the wrestling with the angel,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Gen. 32:25-32.</i> this never occurred other than in a dream. The touching of the hollow of his thigh (and the passage following) until “the sinew of the thigh vein”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. Gen. 32:26, 33. This comment is intended to answer the following problem: If indeed the wrestling with the angel was but a mental occurrence, how and why did Jacob limp in the morning (v. 32)?</i> was intended as an allusion to evil events that would befall Jacob in respect of women, for <i>nasheh</i> (“thigh vein”) is equivocal,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. The Hebrew term could also be taken as the root for <i>’ishah</i> (“woman”); consequently, the maiming of that limb would be an oblique allusion to being maimed on account of woman. Accordingly, Jacob was maimed in the thigh during the course of the vision, through some divine instrument.</i> similar to <i>ḥovlim</i> and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Cf. <i>Guide</i> II:43, which refers to <i>ḥovlim</i> and other instances of metathesis. On Kaspi’s use of metathesis, see above Chapter 2.</i> Accordingly he experienced the events of Dinah,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. He is referring to the rape of Dinah in Gen. 34.</i> Rachel,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. He is referring to the tragic death of Rachel in Gen. 35:16 ff.</i> and Rebeccah’s handmaid.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. Gen. 35:8. All three instances caused Jacob much grief.</i>
Similarly, I maintain that the incident wherein Isaiah went naked and barefoot<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. Isa. 20:3.</i> occurred in its entirety when he was awake,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. The <i>Guide</i> II:46 insists that the event occurred in a vision.</i> having been commanded to (act) thus in a dream. This was similar to Ezekiel’s being commanded in a dream, which (is followed by) his saying, “I arose in the morning and did so,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Ezek. 24:18.</i> as well as, “I say for a fact that what I have done will be done to you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. Ezek. 24:22, which should be understood to imply that what had been done had occurred before their eyes, and not merely in Ezekiel’s vision.</i> One cannot raise a question from Isaiah’s statement (in the above passage)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. The question that Kaspi appears to refer to is: How was it possible for the prophet of the Lord to parade himself naked, and thereby to disgrace himself?</i> of “with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt,”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Isa. 20:4.</i> and “naked and barefoot.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Isa. 20:3.</i> For this should be understood in accordance with logic and nature, (which assert that) terms signifying deprivation or absolute negation (could be used) to describe one who possesses some partial perfection,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. This answer states that Isaiah was not completely naked, for even one who is partially covered or clothed can be called “naked.”</i> as was explained in the <i>Prior Analytics</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. I have not found such a reference in this particular work of Aristotle. Cf. the following note.</i> and <i>De Caelo.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. In the <i>De Caelo</i> 303a, Aristotle affirms that all judgments are relative. Thus descriptive terms such as “naked” might be relative to one who is fully dressed.</i> It was similar with Ezekiel when he ate “bread on cow’s dung,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Ezek. 4:15. In the <i>Guide</i> all this is explained as occurring in a prophetic vision.</i> where the real meaning is (that he ate bread) in proximity to those things. It was similar when he shaved his beard and head,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">24. Ezek. 5:1. Here Kaspi refers to the question: How could the prophet have completely shaved his head, in violation of the Biblical commandment not to shave the corners of one’s beard? By equating that act with the earlier instances, Kaspi implies that here too the prophet might have left the “corners” of his beard intact.</i> that being an appropriate prophetic act.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">25. What is intended here is Kaspi’s oft-repeated assertion that the prophets would on occasion act in some bizarre way, so as to draw attention to a point that they wanted to stress. In the next paragraph Kaspi goes on to list other similar acts, undertaken for this purpose, even if some of those acts contravene points of law.</i>
Further remarkable acts of this kind, performed as temporary decrees, include Ezekiel’s lying on his sides (for 390 days),<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">26. Ezek. 4:4-12.</i> even though it would have sufficed to act thus for one moment; also the act of Jeremiah in hiding the girdle in the river Perath<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">27. Jer. 13:5. The reference is to Maimonides’ comment, in the <i>Guide</i> II:46, that Jeremiah could never have done this, for that prophet never left the land of Israel to go to Babylon. Maimonides’ conclusion was that the entire event should be understood as happening in a vision. Kaspi here asserts that it is possible that Jeremiah went to that river to perform this act, even though the journey itself is not recorded.</i> for who knows, he might have waded partway into the Perath river; as well as the act of Hosea<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">28. Hos. 1:2-3. This too is taken by Maimonides to have occurred in a vision.</i> —for there would be no wonder if on one occasion he lay with a harlot in order to achieve the acceptance by the masses of the prophetic metaphor, for the purpose of saving the entire people, (and in the hope) that they might hear and desist. Together these instances illustrate the principle that prophets cus-155a tomarily | do things to make an impression upon the observers.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">29. In the <i>’Adnei Kesef</i> (AK II 133, AK I 153), Kaspi asserts that the prophet deliberately makes himself an object of derision—indeed Kaspi considered this kind of behavior to be one of the distinguishing marks of the prophet, as opposed to the more conventional behavior of philosophers and scholars (AK I 52). All this is in direct opposition to Maimonides, in the <i>Guide</i> II:46, who says that “God is too exalted that He should turn His prophets into a laughing stock and a mockery for fools by ordering them to carry out crazy actions.” It is also a possibility that Kaspi’s treatment at the hands of his contemporaries led him to see the prophets as being derided and mocked at. On this aspect of Kaspi’s life, and its effect on his thought, see above Chapter 1.</i>
Reliable evidence of this is provided by Ahijah the Shilonite, who tore that garment into twelve strips.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">30. I Kings 11:30.</i> Now he could have communicated the prophetic message without tearing a garment. It was, however, precisely this prophetic method (that would be undertaken) to reinforce the impact on the imagination of the hearer. So too the prophet suffered emotional bitterness and injury in order to make an impression on Ahab.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">31. I Kings 17.</i>
And the false prophets imitated these things, such as the act of Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah in making iron horns for himself when awake,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">32. II Chron. 18:10.</i> (and imitated) Jeremiah the true prophet, who also made himself bands and bars and put them on his neck.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">33. Jer. 27:2.</i>
That this took place while he was awake, even according to Maimonides, is proven by Hananiah, who broke them.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">34. Jer. 28:10.</i> This is especially true of what is written in Ezekiel, where he was to do certain things before all Israel, and the Lord was to say to him “What doest thou,”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">35. Ezek. 12:9 ff.</i> so that Ezekiel could answer by way of parable and analogy, “You should do the same thing, for Jerusalem is to be destroyed.”
For this reason I question Maimonides in several instances where he said that they never occurred when the prophet was awake. It is my intention to say that whenever a prophet was commanded in a dream to do something when awake, he—i.e., the prophet—did that when he was awake.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">36. Other instances of a similar nature are discussed by Kaspi earlier in chap. XIII, above p. 216.</i>
There were, however, without any doubt instances where the prophet did not do those things when awake, for they only occurred as part of a dream, but never when awake, such as Isaiah’s parable of the vineyard,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">37. Isa. 5.</i> and the eagle of Ezeliek,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">38. Ezek. 17.</i> which are to be compared to philosophic parables that compare matter to wax, and many others that are similar.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">39. He means that such parables do not describe any particular actions performed by the prophets—they are merely explanatory and discursive.</i> What must be undertaken with precision is to distinguish the one kind (of prophetic dream) from the other—and for this, great study is required.

Chapter 23

As for the solution to the twenty-sixth question,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1. The broad outlines of the arguments mentioned in this chapter are also found, in the abbreviated form, in the MS of the <i>Retuḳot Kesef,</i> fol. 16b. The question dealt with in this chapter is evidently one that relates to the morality of the actions of Jacob’s sons in the incident of the rape of Dinah in Gen. 34.</i> it was clarified by Him who gave the Torah, when at the conclusion of His words He stated with reference to all of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">2. “Them” here evidently refers to the male inhabitants of the town of Shechem.</i> “because they had defiled their sister,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">3. Gen. 34:27.</i> having said of Shechem alone at the outset that “he had defiled Dinah their sister.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">4. Gen. 34:13. He means that the Torah itself implicates the Shechemites and implies their guilt by using the plural form in describing the defilement of Dinah.</i>
Ezekiel clarified this when he said, “I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">5. Ezek. 3:17.</i> and said, “thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his 156 blood will I require at thy hand.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">6. Ezek. 3:18. He understands the verse to be saying that the prophet himself would be an accomplice to their sins were he not to attempt to rebuke them.</i> | Maimonides explained this (by saying) that one who omits to save another could be said to have killed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">7. <i>Guide</i> III:40, “man is held responsible for every act causing damage deriving from his possessions or deriving from an act of his if only it was possible for him to be cautious and take care not to avoid damage.”</i> The sages, may their memory be blessed, said also, “Whoever had it within his power to oppose (an act), but did not do so, could be said to have committed it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">8. BT <i>Shabbat</i> 54b, BT <i>’Avodah Zarah</i> 18a.</i> It is a general rule, whether in Hebrew or any (other) language, that an act is attributed to and associated with anyone who omitted to prevent that act, or who did not bring about its opposite.
For this reason it is said, “every daughter you shall give life,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">9. Exod. 1:22, where the JPS translation has: “you shall save alive.” The literal implication of the Hebrew is that by not killing the daughters, the midwives were giving them life.</i> and “Joshua gave life,”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10. Josh. 6:25, where the JPS translation has: “did Joshua save alive.”</i> as well as “Elisha gave life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11. II Kings 8:5, where the JPS translation has: “restored to life.”</i> There are many similar instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">12. These particular examples indicate that Kaspi believed that these prophets did not revive the dead, but rather prevented them from death in the first place. For a discussion of this point, see above Chapter 4.</i>
Consequently, there is no doubt that had all the inhabitants of the city (of Shechem) not remained silent, Shechem would not have been able to do this.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">13. The reference here is not to the initial abduction of Dinah, but rather to the continued imprisonment of the girl, as is clear from v. 26, which says, “and they took Dinah out of Shechem’s house,” where she had been held all along.</i> (Their guilt) is all the more evident in that it would appear, from the Torah’s hint in the words “because they had defiled their sister.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">14. Cf. above n. 4.</i> that they were amused in that (affair). (Other instances of such terminology are) what is written, “ye have slain his sons three-score and ten,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">15. Judg. 9:18, where it was not the people addressed who had killed those seventy souls, but rather Abimelech the son of Jerubaal (cf. v. 5 there).</i> and “so Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">16. II Sam. 3:30, where in reality it was Joab alone who had killed Abner (cf. v. 27 there).</i>
Now even though the writer of the Torah did not allude to this here, in my opinion there is (further) justification for the children of Jacob, from something that occurred earlier to Abraham, as well as to Isaac and Jacob. This is the fact that the land of Canaan belonged to them, as Jeremiah explained when he said, “I have made the earth … and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">17. Jer. 27:5.</i> And because the Lord had decreed and desired that the descendants of Abraham would destroy the Canaanites, what (Jacob’s) children did in the present instance to Shechem was part of the divine will and decree. What was done was done. If only they had done the same with all the Canaanites, then our forefathers would not have had to wander in the desert for forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">18. Kaspi appears to feel that had the sons of Jacob killed all the Canaanites at that time, then the twelve spies in the Book of Numbers would not have had the terrifying news that caused the Israelites to rebel and God to decree the additional thirty-eight years in the desert.</i>
Now even though this is all true,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">19. Kaspi now deals with the problem that if, according to his argument, there was nothing reprehensible in the act of Jacob’s children in killing the Shechemites, then why did Jacob rebuke them in Gen. 34:30?</i> the writer of the Torah demonstrated to us the wisdom of old, experienced men, as Aristotle said in the <i>Ethics,</i> that to listen to the old is no less than to listen to demonstrative proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">20. Aristotle, <i>Ethics,</i> VI, 11, 1143b: “Therefore we ought to attend to the undemonstrated sayings and opinions of … older people … not less than to demonstrations, for because of experience … they see right.”</i> For this reason, while Jacob the old man saw that justice required that his sons do what they did, he became angry and said that one should not endanger oneself on account of what may or may not be.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">21. The reference of these enigmatic words is not clear. Perhaps Kaspi means that Dinah might well have been freed by the Shechemites without the attack; or else that the risk of failure was not offset by the continued imprisonment of Dinah.</i> One should certainly not (endanger oneself) in order to hasten the appointed time that had been told to Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">22. The reference is to Gen. 15:13 with its decree of a four-hundred-year exile.</i>
Thus, at Jacob’s death, he said to them, “Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">23. Gen. 49:7. For a differing interpretation, one that is more critical of Jacob’s role, see M. Sternberg, “’Izun ‘Adin Be-Sippur ‘Ones Dinah,” <i>Ha-Sifrut,</i> 1973, pp. 195 ff.</i> This was all written by the writer of the Torah to reprove us, and to teach us knowledge. And if by our sins we transgressed and erred (in the past), we continue to do so today.
