Introduction



Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2


<b>The earth was unformed and desolate.</b> That is, after it was created it was unformed and desolate. Alternatively, the site in which it was to be created was unformed and desolate prior to its creation. Scripture does not mention the creation of anything that cannot be perceived by human eyes, such as the Divine Throne, Gehinnom, etc. Nevertheless, they are included in the statement, “The heavens and the earth were completed and all their conglomerations.” 
According to the Talmud the heavens were also created unformed and desolate. This is not mentioned, however, out of consideration for the Divine Presence dwelling there.
<b>And darkness.</b> This phrase is a continuation of the previous verse: “In the beginning Elokim created the heavens and the earth … and darkness.” In other words, darkness is a positive creation, not merely a negation. See <i>Yeshayahu</i> 45:7

Chapter 2

Chapter 4



Verse 1


<b>With Ad-noy.</b> This is the four-letter name signifying the attribute of mercy. From here on this name predominates because the inclination to sin was now too powerful for human beings to survive strict judgment.

<b>This one will bring us rest.</b> Adam was told, “In sorrow you shall eat from it <i>all the days of your life</i>,” and since Adam died before Noach was born, Lemech thought that Noach would repair what Adam had spoiled.

<b>Make a skylight (<i>tzohar</i>).</b> To reconcile two views presented in the <i>Midrash</i> — this is the window through which he dispatched the raven and the dove, but as long as it was closed he hung there a luminous stone. On the plain level <i>tzohar</i> is related to <i>yitzhar</i> — “olive oil”; i.e. the ark was illuminated with an oil lamp. A window would have provided no light since the celestial bodies did not shine throughout the year of the flood. 

<b>In its side.</b> At an extremity, not in the middle, lest it bear the full force of wind and water. Alternatively, it was in the upper third of the side.

<b>The second year.</b> Since Yaakov arrived, i.e. the fourth year of the famine. For three years they lived on their stores or purchased grain with money. The fourth year they paid with livestock, the fifth with land and the sixth with their bodies. In the seventh year he gave them seed grain and they harvested in the eighth.

Chapter 48



Verse 1

<b>Behold your father is ill.</b> Until then no one had ever become sick; when a person’s time came he simply sneezed and his soul expired. But Yaakov requested forewarning so that he would have time to leave last instructions.

Verse 5

<b>And now your two sons.</b> Yoseif merited producing two tribes because he fed his father’s household in time of famine. Alternatively, it was because he was the first born of Yaakov’s principle wife. Or, it was in order that more tribes would descend from Rochel than from the maidservants.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>I buried her there.</b> I could not bury her in the Machpeilah cave because Eisav had not yet relinquished his claim. By the time Leah died, by contrast, Eisav had emigrated to Seir.  
<b>On the road to Ephros.</b> I knew that that spot was destined to be in the portion of her son Binyamin; see I <i>Shemuel</i> 10:2.

Verse 25

<b>Blessings of breasts and womb.</b> That is, of heaven and earth. Alternatively, the breasts of nursing mothers will not dry up prematurely and nor will fetuses die in the womb. The breasts are mentioned first because the milk generally appears before the infant is born.

<b>So the people scattered throughout the entire land of Egypt.</b> Egypt was destined to be struck by the plagues in the future, and perhaps the plain Egyptian folk would complain that they did not deserve to be punished, for they never oppressed the B’nei Yisrael. Therefore, Hashem caused Pharaoh to think of this plan of not giving any stubble to the B’nei Yisrael, and when the B’nei Yisrael had to go out and gather the stubble they were beaten even by the Egyptian slaves and maidservants. Therefore, all the Egyptians were afflicted by the plagues.

<b>And all the water of the river turned into blood.</b> The river turned into blood for only a short while and all the fish died immediately, then, it turned back into water. The Egyptians were unable to drink from the river because it had become polluted as a result of the dead fish and not because it was still blood. We do not find that Pharaoh begged to remove this plague. A further proof is that the sorcerers turned water into blood as well. How were they able to do so if all the water was already blood?

Since they received their provisions with very little effort they were expected to study continually. 
Alternatively: <b>That I may test them.</b> Hashem did not need to test them to know how they would behave but the test was needed to appease both the attribute of judgment, which had serious grievances against them, as well as the attribute of mercy, which was overly solicitous towards them. <b>If they will walk in [the way of] My teaching.</b> As long as they did so the attribute of judgment could have no complaint against them

<b>Ad-noy descended on Mount Sinai.</b> The Torah was given in the desert rather than in the Holy Land so that the other nations could not claim that had it been given in their country they would have accepted it. Alternatively, it could not be given in Eretz Yisrael lest the jealousy of the other tribes be aroused towards the one in whose portion it was given. The original name of this desert was “Sin,” but after the Torah was given, a <i>yud</i> was added to indicate that the Ten Commandments had been given there (the numerical value of the letter <i>yud</i> is 10).

Whenever they encamped they would fill the hollow space with earth and it was upon this that they offered their sacrifices. Then when they set out again they would lift the altar by its poles, attached to the upper edge of the grate, and the earth would spill out through the holes in the grate .

<b>Its sound shall be heard.</b> The purpose of this sound was to inform those outside when the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> was performing the service so that they could have the appropriate intentions in mind. Alternatively, it was to distinguish the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> from ordinary <i>kohanim</i> and to indicate the higher level of sanctity he possessed. This explains why the special garments he wore on Yom Kippur did not have these bells—since he performed the entire service alone, no distinction was necessary.

<b>Betzalel son of Uri son of Chur.</b> Unlike Oholiav in v. 6, Betzalel’s lineage is traced back to his grandfather Chur. This is because Chur was murdered for opposing the making of the Golden Calf (Rashi, 32:5); therefore it was appropriate that his grandson would be the one to fashion the <i>mishkon</i>, which was an atonement for that sin.

<b>Remover the golden rings.</b> Aharon’s intentions were pure. The people had asked for a leader in place of Moshe. Aharon feared that if he appointed someone he would refuse to step down when Moshe returned and if he declined to choose someone for them, they would do so themselves. Finally, if he accepted the position himself Moshe might be hurt. Therefore he decided to occupy them with something else in the meantime.

<b>If his offering is a burnt-offering.</b> This means the owner used an expression of a burnt-offering when he sanctified his offering. The Torah begins with the burnt-offering (עולה) because it is the most sublime (מעולה) and is consumed completely (עולה כלולה למעלה).
<b>He shall bring.</b> This refers to dedicating it.
<b>To the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.</b> This teaches that one who brings an offering should not tell the kohein to come and take the consecrated animal from his house, because this is not an honorable way to act towards God.

<b>If his means are not sufficient.</b> We do not tell him to borrow or work until he has the money [for a sheep]. If he has a sheep but not enough money for his needs, how do we know he should bring the offering of a poor man? The Torah says: For [the acquisition of] a sheep.
<b>One for a sin-offering and one for a burnt-offering.</b> The sin-offering of a bird includes no food for the altar, besides the blood, therefore, one must bring two birds — one as a sin-offering for the koheins consumption and one as a burnt-offering for the altar. However, the rich man sin-offering is only one sheep or goat, since it provides for the koheins consumption as well as innards for the altar.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>One tenth of an ephah.</b> Although this is an exceedingly small amount it is sufficient since it includes a fistful for the altar and the remnants for the kohein. The Torah prefers him to perform the mitzvah immediately and not wait until he is able to bring a sheep or goat. Similarly, regarding ערכים (pledging the value of lives) a poor man gives one silver shekel immediately and does not wait until he becomes wealthy and can bring fifty shekalim.

<b>The <i>kohanim</i>.</b> And not the invalid <i>kohanim</i>. From where do we know that all the Israelites are included [to be eligible to rule concerning the plague of <i>tzora’as</i>]? The Torah states: “or to one.” If so, why does the Torah say, “of his sons, the <i>kohanim</i>”? This teaches that the pronouncement of pure or impure must be from the mouth of the <i>kohein</i>. How is this accomplished? An Israelite Torah scholar looks at the plague of <i>tzora’as</i> and tells the <i>kohein</i> what to say, even if the <i>kohein</i> is a simpleton: [The Israelite tells the <i>kohein</i>,] “Say it is unclean” and he will be unclean, “say he is clean” and he will be clean.

He shall mourn over his deeds since it was due to his bad deeds that the plague came to him.
<b>And he must cover his head down to his upper lip.</b> This is to stop the bad odor that emanates from his mouth so that he will not harm other people.

Verse 2

<b>On the day of his purification.</b> This teaches that the declaration of being pure or unclean, the slaughtering of the birds, the sprinkling of the bird’s blood, and the <i>metzoro</i>’s shaving shall be performed in the day. Additionally, this teaches that he should not delay.
<b>He shall be brought to the <i>kohein</i>.</b> This means that the matter of his purification shall be brought to the <i>kohein</i>, but the <i>metzoro</i> himself is prohibited to enter the encampment. Similarly, it says close by, “the <i>kohein</i> shall go out beyond the encampment.” An alternative explanation is that on the day of his purification they bring him to the edge of the encampment and the <i>kohein</i> goes out to meet him.

Verse 6

<b>And the live bird in the blood.</b> This is done so it will be stained speckled when it is sent into the field. Then, its kind will recognize that the bird has been tampered with and they will gather against it and kill it. As a result, another <i>metzoro</i> will not find it and use it as a sacrifice, which would be contrary to what the Torah said: “It shall atone for him,” but not for another person. Our Sages also said that if the bird returns the <i>tzora’as</i> will return. The proof comes from the verse, “Is My inheritance to Me a speckled bird of prey?” (Yirmiyahu 12:9). Where is it that the Torah speaks of a speckled bird if not in this place? However, the Talmud proves that the bird that is sent away is permitted based on logic: It cannot be that the Torah says to send it away and it would be a stumbling block.

<b>When you will come.</b> It does not say, “when you will come” in regard to the eruptions affecting people and garments because they were applicable even in the wilderness. However, since they did not have houses in the wilderness it says concerning the eruption in houses, “When you will come into the land of Canaan.” 
<b>And I shall put the eruption of <i>tzora’as</i>.</b> There are those who explain according to the plain meaning that since it says later on (Devarim 12:2), “You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations, that you shall possess, worshipped their gods” — but the Jews would not know in which places the Canaanites worshipped — therefore the eruption in the houses serves the purpose of informing them in which place the Canaanites worshipped their idols so they would be destroyed.

<b>And to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.</b> As long as Moshe did not yet establish the Mishkan the sacrifices could be offered in any place, as we find (Shemos 24:5): “He sent the youths [first-born] of B’nei Yisrael and they offered burnt-offerings.” After the Mishkan was established they were cautioned and it was prohibited to sacrifice except at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. <b>It shall be considered for that person as blood.</b> The verse speaks of non-consecrated animals, to accustom them to withdraw from idol worship, as it continues to explain, “They shall no longer slaughter their sacrifices to the demons after which they go astray.” Moshe commanded them now that they should turn their non-consecrated meat into peace-offerings. 
<b>He has spilled blood, and that person shall be cut off.</b> He has spilled blood that he should have cast before Hashem.

<b>Wild animal or fowl.</b> From this we derive that] the fowl should resemble the wild animal, just as the wild animal is [a type that is] not sacrificed, so too the [type of] fowl [we are dealing with is one that] is not sacrificed, which excludes [a type of] fowl that is sacrificed on the altar; the blood of these need not be covered (Chullin 84a).

<b>His father.</b> But not your father’s father. <b>Or his mother.</b> But not your mother’s mother (<i>Toras Kohanim</i>).
<b>He has cursed his father or mother.</b> The verse juxtaposes “curses” to “his father” and “has cursed” to “his mother” to teach that one is liable for cursing one without the other.

<b>However, he may not enter to the Curtain and he shall not approach the Altar.</b> If it only mentioned that a blemished <i>kohein</i> may not approach the Curtain and did not mention the Altar, I would have thought that although he is invalid to approach the Curtain, which is inside [the Sanctuary], still, he should be permitted to approach the Altar which is not inside. And if only the Altar was mentioned and not the Curtain, I would have thought that he may not approach the Altar which is prepared for Divine service, but the Curtain, which is not prepared for service (except for sprinkling the blood of the burnt oxen), he would not be invalid for approach. Therefore, it needs to mention both the Altar and the Curtain. 
<b>For I am Adonoy, who sanctifies them.</b> “Them” refers to the Curtain and the Altar, and therefore it is not fitting that a blemished <i>kohein</i> approach them.

The reason is that if it were to specify the date we would not count the seven weeks. We would merely rely on the date to make the Festival. However, the counting is a great thing as we explained previously … Since the counting of fifty days is only for the sake of Shavuos, the <i>omer</i> offering is not considered a “season” and we do not bless Shehecheyanu [Who has kept us alive … to this season] on the <i>omer</i>.

<b>And all those who heard him shall lay their hands.</b> Why does this case require laying of the hands more than any other death penalty? The answer is because at the time of the verdict the judges had to demand from the witnesses to repeat what they heard explicitly, and the witnesses had to pronounce clearly the blasphemy they heard. Therefore they laid their hands upon him as if to say, “The sin that we had to curse Hashem’s Name is entirely your fault, because you caused it”.

Verse 2

<b>When you come to the land.</b> After inheriting and settling the land, as it says (v. 3), “Your vineyard,” “Your field,” which means each person should know where his portion is.  
<b>The land shall be at rest</b>. This connotes being null and void. I might think this means you should not dig pits, ditches, or cisterns; therefore the Torah says (v. 4): “You shall not plant your field and you shall not prune your vineyard.”  

<b>A <i>Shabbos </i>for Adonoy.</b> Rashi explains this means for Hashem’s sake.  That is to say, your intention should not be to leave it fallow so the land will improve; rather, your intention should be to perform Hashem’s commandment.

Verse 3

Verse 5

<b>And the grapes of your untended vines.</b> These are the grapes that come without labor and without trouble, like grain crops that grew on their own. The proof is that it says (v. 11), “You shall not reap crops that grew on their own; and you shall not gather the [grapes of] its untended vineyard.” The Targum is: “That which was left,” what was left behind and not pruned.  
<b>It shall be a year of complete rest for the land.</b> It is not in your possession in that year.

He thus caused that the hallowed and awesome Name of Hashem be erased in the water.

<b>They stood by during the counting.</b> Rashi explained: “They stood with Moshe and Aharon when they counted [Bnei] Yisroel.” Therefore, “They brought their offerings” (v. 3) as an atonement because they counted Bnei Yisroel. We find the same in the section about the war with Midyan, “And they said to Moshe: Your servants have taken a census of the soldiers who went out to war… We have therefore brought an offering for Hashem… to atone for ourselves” (31:49-50).

<b>Instead of all firstborn</b>. If the firstborn were to do the Divine service it could result in a plague. This is because the father of a firstborn is not necessarily a firstborn himself, and as a result the firstborn would not have the advantage of learning about the service from his father. When he came to do the Divine service he would not know how to be careful and would make mistakes, causing a plague, as we find regarding Nadav and Avihu. The Levites, on the other hand, since they and their descendants were chosen, will have experience and do the Divine service properly and be careful. Furthermore, they will not do any other work besides the Divine service, so that their hands will not become accustomed to labor, which would make their arms and fingers thick and heavy, not suitable for playing the harp and violin.

<b>And it shall be a remembrance for you.</b> Since on your joyous days, which are the festivals, “you shall blow with the trumpets,” and therefore when you blow <i>teruah</i> at wartime Hashem will remember the merit of the offerings and you will be delivered.

Since this leprosy came through sin there is an opening to say that it can be taken away through prayer, as we found concerning Pharaoh and other places. Therefore, you have to pray for her.

Another explanation: It refers to the verse above, “The nations will say” — show Your might to all that You are able to bring them to the Land and vanquish kings before them.

Verse 18

<b>Slow to anger.</b> Here, Moshe did not mention the name of God א-ל [from the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy], because it connotes strength and might, and he did not want Hashem to show His might to Israel. He also did not mention “merciful and gracious” because these Attributes are relevant in requesting a gift, and Moshe was only asking that Hashem should forgive them and not for a gift. Additionally, he did not wish to mention “and truth” because he was asking Hashem to forgive them beyond the letter of the law, and truth connotes the strict letter of the law.

Even if Hashem would say that He chose Aharon, they would still contest the priesthood. Korach and the 250 men, on the other hand, accepted to take the fire pans. They thought that Hashem did not send Aharon to be <i>Kohein Gadol</i>, and Moshe appointed him on his own accord. Therefore, Moshe did not seek to curse them.

The answer is that there are examples where one thing has multiple roles, such as fire that melts tin and other substances but hardens eggs and other things. Also, medicines cure the sick but harm healthy people. Therefore, we can understand through reason that it is possible that the Holy One commanded that these will become pure and these will become impure.

The answer is that if it mentioned the <i>Mishkan</i> and did not mention the <i>Mikdash</i>, I would have thought that one would be liable only for defiling the <i>Mishkan</i>, which was anointed with the anointing oil, but he would not be liable for defiling the <i>Mikdash</i>. And if it mentioned only the <i>Mikdash</i>, I would have thought that one is liable only for defiling the <i>Mikdash</i> since its holiness is eternal, but he would not be liable for the <i>Mishkan</i>.

<b>Adonoy’s angel passed further ahead.</b> Rashi explains: He was showing Bil'am a hint regarding the Patriarchs. In other words, when Bil'am at first came to curse the descendants of Avraham, the merit of their forefather Avraham was insufficient to protect Israel; the path for Bil'am was wide open on both sides, corresponding to Yishmael and the sons of Keturah. That is the significance of, and went into the field, (v. 23). When Bil'am went another time to curse, the merit of Yitzchak was insufficient to protect them; the path for Bil'am was open on one side, corresponding to Esau the son of Yitzchak. That is the significance of, she was pressed against the wall, (v. 25). When Bil'am went again to curse, the merit of Yaakov helped them, as his progeny were all perfect. This is the significance of, where there was no room to turn [either] to the right or to the left.

Chapter 23



Verse 1

<b>Build seven altars for me here.</b> This was in order to counterbalance the seven altars that were built by seven righteous people until Moshe — Adam, Hevel, Noach, Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, and Moshe — which they built in order to save the land of the seven nations. Corresponding to those, Bil'am made altars for himself seven times.

Verse 3

<b>And he went away alone.</b> He was crushed and injured from being pressed against the wall. Yet, because of his great hatred towards them [Israel], Bil'am did not wait to go until he was healed.

<b>Only by lot should the land be divided.</b> Before the Land is divided into 57 portions for the heads of families, it was divided by lottery according to the tribes of each family head. How was this done? The Land was divided into twelve territories corresponding to the twelve tribes, and the names of the twelve territories were written on twelve notes and put in one container, and the names of the twelve tribes on twelve notes in another container. Each tribe received the territory that was drawn with it. The boundary between each tribe and its neighbor was then adjusted according to the size of the tribes’ population, so that each tribe received what was proper, as it says, To the large [tribe], increase their inheritance. If they would have divided the Land originally by lottery with 57 portions for the 57 heads of families, and afterwards by twelve portions for twelve tribes, a family could find that their portion would be in a tribe that is not theirs.

<b>You shall be vigilant to offer to Me.</b> Being vigilant refers to examining the offering for blemishes, just as it does regarding the Pesach-offering.  
<b>At its prescribed time</b> — even on Shabbos; even when spiritually impure. If no pure person is found, do not abandon the offering, and even during a time of war. Alternatively, at its prescribed time means it should not be brought before morning or after evening falls.

Verse 9

<b>On the Shabbos day.</b> Regarding all the offering, Scripture usually says either “offer” or “bring,” while regarding Shabbos it does not. This is because on Shabbos all types of <i>melachah</i> (work) are forbidden. Therefore, out of honor for Shabbos the Torah did not mention offering or bringing, as if <i>melachah</i> was not done in bringing the Shabbos offerings.  
<b>Two lambs.</b> Hashem did not burden them with the <i>Musaf</i>-offerings of Shabbos too much, only the same as the constant offering. Furthermore, a sin-offering was not mentioned as the other <i>Musaf</i>-offerings because of the honor of Shabbos.

Verse 10

<b>This is the burnt-offering on its Shabbos.</b> A goat for atonement was not mentioned on Shabbos. Regarding the Yom Tov and Rosh Chodesh offerings, in which it is written either atonement or sin-offering, the Sages decreed that their sections should be read from a sefer Torah as <i>maftir</i>. The reading takes the place of actually offering them. However, regarding the <i>Musaf</i>-offering of Shabbos it says neither sin-offering nor atonement, which teaches that its offerings do not come to atone. This is because Shabbos itself atones, and the offerings are only for a pleasing aroma. Therefore, we do not read from a sefer Torah about the Shabbos <i>Musaf</i>-offering as we do for the others.

<b>To benefit us for all time.</b> This means that we will be those who receive all the days, which refers to the World to Come. This is the answer to those fools, and those who lack intelligence, the heretics who ask why Moshe did not specify to the Jewish people that they would inherit the Garden of Eden and enter the World to Come if they fulfill the words of the Torah. The answer is that here the verse explicitly mentions the eternal reward in the World to Come. The reason that it does not clarify this in many other places, but only with regard to inheriting the land of Israel and material prosperity, is because it wants to state something which applies to everyone equally, men, women and children, to those who are wise and those who are not, in order to draw their hearts to fear Hashem.

<b>Take heed.</b> The reason that the verse is so stringent with regard to the prohibition of other altars once the Beis HaMikdosh is built is because those altars cause Yisroel to refrain from ascending to Jerusalem on the festivals and offering their sacrifices there. Once they started offering their sacrifices and incense on other altars they began to offer them to the Golden Calves at Beis El and in Dan.

<b>You are forbidden to slaughter the <i>pesach.</i></b> This is also true of all other sacrifices. Since the verse states, “In all your dwelling-places you shall eat <i>matzos</i>” (Shemos 12:20) one might have thought that the <i>pesach</i> offering was similar. Therefore the verse teaches that you may not slaughter the <i>pesach</i> in any of your cities. Alternatively … one should not think that since the <i>pesach </i>sacrifice is entirely eaten by non-<i>kohanim,</i> its slaughter can also be in any place.

However, on Shavuos there is no hint. Therefore the Torah states, "Remember that you were a slave in Egypt."  
Do not say to yourself that you cannot take time off from the harvesting to celebrate, but remember that once upon a time you had no freedom to take a break from working and to rejoice, before Hashem brought you out of Egypt. For this reason you must guard and celebrate the festival .

<b>And measure.</b> Even if it is found very near to a city, there is a <i>mitzva</i> to measure. Through this the matter will become publicized, and people will come from the cities to which it is being measured. When someone comes from his home and does not return, his family will come out, and someone will recognize the deceased. If they recognize him they can testify about him, and his wife will not remain a chained woman, unable to remarry, and his children will be able to inherit his estate. Through this they will also discover who accompanied him on the journey, and the murderer may be found in this way.

<b>He is to recognize.</b> When a person does not want to do kindness for a relative, he acts as though he does not recognize him, as the verse states, “And Yosef made himself foreign to [his brothers]” (Bereishis 42:7). The verse therefore teaches that the father must act in a way which recognizes this son, for example he must tell people who do not know him that he is his firstborn. This verse also teaches that a man is believed to say that this is his firstborn son. <b>To give him.</b> This teaches that if a man dies and leaves behind a pregnant wife, the son born does not have the status of a firstborn, because his father never recognized him in his lifetime (Bava Basra 142b).

<b>Even both of them shall die.</b> Rashi explains that this adds those following them. In other words, you should not say that since the sentence for the adultery and adulteress was that they should be put to death, therefore they are considered as if they are already dead. If others come and act promiscuously with them one may think that since the first are already considered to be dead, the other people have not committed adultery, as we would say if someone were to kill them, that they have killed one who is already dead. Therefore Rashi teaches that also others who subsequently have relations with these two are also killed. Alternatively, both of them comes to include even if the woman is pregnant, that the court does not wait until she gives birth before putting her to death.

Verse 2

<b>You are to take of the first.</b> The Torah repeats this information in order to teach the correct order of performing these mitzvos.
 <b>Of the first.</b> Rashi explains that this teaches that they were not obligated to bring all of the first fruits. In other words, you are not obligated to bring every kind of fruit as first fruits, but only certain species. Alternatively, “Of the first” means of the best, similar to the phrase, “Yisroel is holy to Hashem, the first of His produce” (Yirmiya 2:3), which is a phrase meaning “praise.” Alternatively, “Of the first” means from those that ripen first, because they are the most precious.  
<b>All the fruits of your soil.</b> You bring fruits as the first fruits, but not wine or oil. 
<b>And place it in a basket.</b> This is to present it in a more honored fashion, rather than simply bringing it in one’s hands, or in one’s pockets.  
<b>And go to the place.</b> The entire process must be performed by the one to whom the first fruits belong, from the harvesting to bringing it. It may not be done by another on his behalf. This is appropriate, for if a king were to give one of his servants a field to work for him, the servant himself should bring a gift of the fruits to the king.

<b>Let my instruction flow like rainfall.</b> The words which I say to you are not worthless.

Alternatively, this phrase refers to prayer. May it be Hashem’s will that my words do not return empty, but flourish in the hearts of those who hear them, as rain and dew on the earth, which cause plants to grow and sprout.

<b>The Almighty’s works are flawless.</b> This refers to what was mentioned earlier, the heavens, the earth and the four dimensions.  
<b>His works are flawless.</b> His works are perfect and complete. Hashem’s attributes are not like those of flesh and blood. If a human being constructs a building, it is never perfect or complete, because he himself did not construct the raw materials from which it was built. He merely arranged them, one on top of the other. However, Hashem’s works are perfect and complete, for He created everything.  
<b>For all His ways are just.</b> Since Moshe wishes to now speak of Hashem’s vengeance against the Jewish people, and then of His vengeance against the gentile nations who enslaved them, Moshe first proclaimed Hashem’s justice, that every act of Hashem’s is righteous and just.

Verse 9

If his mother or father, brother or son, dies, he must act as if he does not know them, and not mourn for them… Why? For they observed Your command, as the verse states, “He shall not depart from the <i>Mikdosh</i>.” Even at his moment of pain, he does not have permission to go out after them to the burial… Alternatively, Who said of his father and mother, “I did not see them,” because he did not follow their mistake when they worshipped the Golden Calf.

Verse 10

<b>They shall teach Your law to Yaakov.</b> Since they show no favoritism, it is appropriate that they are the ones to teach the laws… Alternatively, since they have the time, because they do not have a portion of land to take up their time, they are free to teach Torah.

However, Yoseif did not listen to the voice of the woman, as it says, “He did not listen to her” (Bereishis 39:10), therefore Hashem will bless his land.

<b>He shall be favored by his brothers.</b> When Reuven sinned Asher went and told his brothers, and they despised him. They said, “This is how you speak badly of your elder brother?” They excommunicated Asher. Moshe came and revoked the excommunication. Just as one says to those who excommunicate “cursed”, so too he says to the one who revokes the excommunication “blessed.” Since one who is excommunicated is prohibited from marital relations, the verse states, “Shall be blessed with sons.” And since his brothers distanced him, Moshe said, “He shall be favored by his brothers,” and they should draw him close. Since one who is excommunicated is prohibited from anointing himself with oils, Moshe blessed him that “he immerses his foot in oil.” Since one who is excommunicated is prohibited from wearing shoes, Moshe blessed him, “Your shoes are iron and copper.”
