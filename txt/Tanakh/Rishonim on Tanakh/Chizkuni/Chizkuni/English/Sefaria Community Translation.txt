תוצא הארץ, “let the earth bring forth;” The expression תוצא seems to imply that these creations already existed (and just needed to sprout forth from the ground).

Verse 25


חיתו ארץ — The ו in the word חיתו is superfluous (added for stylish purposes).

אשר שם הזהב  The word: חוילה, occurs in the Torah twice more, once in Genesis 10,7, and once in verse 29 of that chapter. Therefore the Torah wished to indicate that the gold mentioned here is that which used to be brought from Ophir.

ותהיא נציב מלח, “she was turned into a pillar of salt;” her punishment fitted her crime, as Rashi has explained. Rashi claims that when her husband asked his wife to give some salt to his guests so that their food would taste better, she absolutely refused by challenging his right to violate the laws of Sodom concerning the entertaining of any guests. (based on B’reshit Rabbah,50,4) *Alternatively, "his wife gazed behind him and it became... - "it" referring to the entire land becoming filled with salt as it says "all its soil devastated by sulfur and salt." (Deuteronomy 29:22)

“Avraham stood up and prostrated himself;” Avraham was dependent on the goodwill of everyone in that town; even if Efron had been willing to sell his field or plot Avraham would have needed all the townspeople’s permission to convert it into a burial site. Avraham had to first arise in order to prostrate himself in the appropriate manner to all of them, even to the one sitting behind him. But for a single individual such as Efron he was not required to rise, he just prostrated himself before him.

נתתי כסף השדה קח ממני, The word נתתי on earlier it stands, that Ephron said "השדה נתתי לך" And Abhraham answered him "שמעני נתתי?" with wonder. [i.e.,] You said "נתתי לך"  but you the money of the field take from me because as a gift I will not accept it. And the cantillation that is with נתתי proves because there is in it a geresh to separate it from מכסף השדה.

וראיתן על האבנים , you are to closely inspect the birth stools. Pharaoh gave the midwives a sign how to recognise if the approaching birth would be that of a male baby or a female. If a male, the face would be turned downwards and if a female the baby’s face would be looking upwards, as each would do during marital intercourse. [This editor finds it hard to believe that professional midwives needed instruction on this subject from Pharaoh. Ed.]
אם בן הוא והמיתן אותו, “if it is a son, you are to kill him;“ when the Egyptians realised that they could not prevent the Israelites from continuing to increase at an alarming rate, they decided to at least kill their males who might grow up and fight them.
ואם בת היא וחיה, “but if it is a daughter, let her live;” women are not in the habit of fighting during a war. They therefore did not need to be afraid of them.

לעמך, “and for your people;” the letter מ in this word has the semi vowel sheva. Logic tells us that this plague did not last one quarter of a month. If you were to say that the conversation between Moses and Pharaoh took place on the sixth day of this plague, it does not make much sense, as the plague would have come to an end on the following day anyways without Moses praying for its removal.

And the stones that were for the breastplate, each one brought one stone for the name of their tribe and also the anointing oil they brought to sanctify everything. And the anointing oil suggests magnificence because it was used to anoint kings and high priests. And they also brought the incense that was burnt on the golden altar and the same incense that was burnt by the High Priest on Yom Kippur in the Holy of Holies.

Verse 42

In the commandment to dwell in huts (sukkot) for seven days, it is not explicitly mentioned whether this includes both days and nights. How, then, do we know that the obligation encompasses both daytime and nighttime dwelling? We can draw an analogy from the usage of the word "tishvu" (you shall dwell) which appears both here and in a separate context, referring to dwelling in the Tent of Meeting. Just as in the case of the Tent of Meeting, the requirement to dwell therein includes both days and nights, so too, with the commandment to dwell in sukkot, the obligation extends to day and night. However, the Sages offer another explanation, comparing the 15th day mentioned in relation to the Festival of Matzot (Unleavened Bread) and the same date mentioned about the Festival of Sukkot. They infer that just as in the Festival of Matzot, the first night has a mandatory obligation and the following nights are optional, similarly, during the Festival of Sukkot, the first night is compulsory while the subsequent nights are optional. This brings clarity to the obligation of dwelling in sukkot during the seven days, incorporating both daytime and nighttime aspects, with the first night being a strict requirement and following nights being more lenient concerning the need to stay in the sukkah. בסוכות תשבו שבעות ימים, “you are to dwell in huts for seven days.” This is to remind us that in the desert our forefathers relied on the clouds of G-d’s glory to protect them against nature and its inclemency, instead of relying on a man made roof. (Talmud Sukkah folio 11)
All regular residents in Israel are to dwell in a sukkah during the festival. One might think that this obligation does not apply to foreigners, as they might not have a permanent residence. However, the commandment is applicable to both citizens and foreigners living in Israel, even if they have large and luxurious dwellings. This festival was established at the time of the grain harvest and the pressing of the wine, which might lead people to become proud and boastful about their homes that are filled with abundance. They might even believe that their wealth and success are solely due to their own efforts. By dwelling in a sukkah during this time, people are reminded to give praise and thanks to the One who has provided them with their inheritance and homes filled with all that is good. This acts as a reminder of the true source of their blessings and keeps them humble and grateful.

 תכין לך הדרך, “prepare the way for yourself;” the route to such cities of refuge should not be a narrow path, etc., but a road that is easy to travel, and has been marked clearly. Rabbi Avin, son of Rabbi Yaakov, is quoted in a Midrash on Psalms 25,10 describing how every mile or so, there were markers how to get to these cities, and in every kiosk, there were directional signals identifying the route. [The purpose was not only for the killer to know how to get to such cities, but to remind the people at large to be careful never to become guilty of killing through negligence. Ed.] This was hinted at two verses earlier in the same chapter of Psalms.
ושלשת את גבול ארצך, “so that you will effectively divide the borders of your country into three segments;” how did this work out in practice? The Land of Israel was 400 miles long (from south to north) It was about 100 miles from Chevron to Sh’chem, and from there to Kadesh another 100 miles. The three cities of refuge therefore symbolically divided the land into three sections. You will note that the center section therefore was shorter than the northern and southern section respectively. This is accounted for in the minds of the sages by the fact that both Chevron and Sh’chem were cities in which a lot of bloodshed occurred. They quote a verse in Hosea 6,9, as supporting their interpretation.
כל רוצח, “every murderer, regardless of intentional or unintentional.” We explained this already on Numbers 35,14.
