Rashbam on Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

(1) The sophisticated persons will understand that all the words of our Rabbis and their interpretations are solid and true. And this is what is said in Mas. Shabbat (63a), "I was 18 years old, and I did not know that Scripture never departs from its straightforward meaning. Essentially, the laws and interpretations derive from superfluities in Scripture or from variations in language, where the plain sense of Scripture is written in language from which one can derive the essence of the interpretation. For example [Gen. 2:4], "Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created [b'hibar'am]," and the Sages expounded "b'Avraham" from the lengthening of the expression, since there was no need to write "b'hibar'am." And now I will explain the interpretations of the early scholars on this verse, to make clear to people why I did not see fit to interpret as they did.<br>Some interpret, "In the beginning [barishonah] God created the heavens and the earth." One cannot say this, because the water came first, as it is written (v.2), "a wind from God sweeping over the water." Furthermore, it is not written "barishonah" but rather "b'reishit," in the construct state, as in (Gen. 10:10), "The beginning of [reishit] his kingdom was Babel."<br>And the one who interprets it like (Hosea 1:2), "When Adonai began to speak to Hoshea," in other words, "At the beginning of God's creating of the heavens," in other words, when God had not yet created heavens and earth, "the earth was unformed and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God sweeping over the water," the conclusion is that the water was created first. This is also nonsense, as it should not have written "the earth was unformed and void," because, since it had not yet been created, it should not have called it "earth" before the formation of the waters, since the waters came first.<br>But this is the essential straightforward meaning, according to the way of Scripture: that it is standard to anticipate and explain a matter which is unnecessary, for the sake of a matter that is mentioned below in another place. As it is written (Gen. 9:18), "Shem, Ham, and Yafet," and it is written (ibid.), "And Ham was the father of K'na'an." But this is because it is written below, "Cursed be K'na'an," and, had it not been explained initially who K'na'an is, we would not know why Noah cursed him. [Similarly,] "He [R'uven] lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard about it." And nothing is written here to the effect that Ya'akov said anything about R'uven. But since, at the time of his death, he said [about R'uven] (Gen. 49:4), "Unstable as water, you shall excel no longer; For when you mounted your father’s bed, You brought disgrace—my couch he mounted," it says in advance, "Israel heard about it," so that you will not be surprised when you see that he rebukes him for this at the end of his days. And similarly in many places.<br>Also, this whole passage is about the work of the six days of Creation; Moshe our Master puts it in advance to explain to you what the Holy One, blessed be He, said at the time of the Giving of the Torah (Exod. 20:7-10), "Remember the Shabbat and sanctify it, ... for in six days, Adonai made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day." And this is why it is written (Gen. 1:31), "... and there was morning, the sixth day" -- that sixth that was the end of the six days that the Holy One, blessed be He, mentioned at the time of the Giving of the Torah. That is why Moshe said this to Israel, to inform them that the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, is true.<br>And lest you imagine that this world had always been constructed as you see it now, full of all good things? It was not thus; rather, "When God began to create, etc.," in other words, in the beginning of the creation of the heavens and the earth, in other words, at the time when the upper heavens and the earth had already been created, whether for a long time or for a short time, then (v.2) "the earth was etc."

Verse 2

"Then the earth was" – that [earth which] was built already 
"was void and empty" – there was nothing in it, as it is written in Jeremiah, “I saw the earth and, behold, it was void and empty, and [I looked] to the heavens, and there was no light; I saw and there was no man, nor bird of the heavens, nor beast wandering, going forth” – this is <i>tohu vavohu</i>, destruction, without dwellers.
 “and darkness upon the waters” – this is (Jeremiah) “and toward the heavens and there was no light”
“and wind/spirit…blowing upon the waters” – the wind was necessary for what is written further on, “and G-d said, ‘let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one spot”, for it was by the wind that the waters were gathered” - just as the Red Sea was split so that the dry land was visible, by means of “and G-d led the sea with a powerful East wind all that day, turning the sea into dry land, and the waters were split”.

Verse 3

“And G-d said, ‘Let there be light’” – to fix that which was mentioned above – “and darkness upon the face of the deep”.

Verse 4

“And G-d saw the light” – He looked at its appearance [and saw] that it was beautiful. And similarly, “And she saw him, that he was good” – she looked at Moshe born at six months, like Samuel – at the turn of the year – and she saw that he was good and beautiful – his indications (<i> simanav</i>, fingernails and hair were grown – so she hid him three months, that is, until the end of nine months, for behold, she saw him and knew that he was good and beautiful regarding his indications, he was not miscarried.
“And G-d separated between the light and the dark” – such that 12 hours did the day last, and then 12 hours night. Light first, and afterwards, darkness. For, behold, the beginning of the creation of the worlds was with the statement, “Let there be light”. And any darkness that preceded that, as it is written, “and darkness on the face of the deep” – this was not night.

Verse 5

AND THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING.  It does not say, "And there was night and there was day," but rather, "there was evening."  For the first day darkened and the sun set, "and there was morning" -- the morning of [following] the night, for the dawn broke, and thereby was the first day of the six days to which the Holy One, blessed be He, referred in the Ten Sayings.  And after that the second day began: "God said, 'Let there be an expanse.'"  Scripture does not come to say that the evening and the morning constitute one day; all that we need is how there were six days, for the day breaks and the night is ended, and thus one day ends and the second day begins.

Verse 6

“And G-d said, ‘Let there be a firmament’” – after the first days was completed, the next morning, G-d said…
“Firmament” (<i>rakia</i>) – in the passive voice, like <i>ashir</i> (“rich”), meaning “made rich”, or <i>chasid</i> (“pious”), meaning “made pious”. For, from the earth up until the supernal heavens there was water, as it is written, “(the spirit of G-d) hovering upon the face of the waters”, and now the Holy One (praised be He!) divided them at the middle and made a hammered-out plate extending from east to west and from north to south to make a distinction between the supernal waters. Now since he didn’t complete the work of the waters until the third day, when dry land appeared, it does not state “it was good” on the second day, but on the third day it is stated twice, “it was good” – once for the work of the waters and once for the emergence of the trees and grasses.
“between water and water” – so that half would be above and half would be below.


Verse 7



Verse 8

“And G-d called the firmament ‘heaven’” – as I explained above, that is, it is called <i>shamayim</i> everywhere in the Torah, and the supernal waters were included in the heavens of the heavens and all their host, [as in] “indeed, to Hashem are the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, etc.”
“And it was evening, and it was morning, a second day” – the day inclined toward evening, after which was the morning after the second day, behold, the second of the six days spoken of by the Holy One (praised be He!) in the Ten Commandments, and now the third day began that morning.


Verse 9

“And G-d said, ‘Let gather’” – as I explained above, by means of the wind, for that is why it is said, “A wind/spirit of G-d hovering..”, as with the splitting of the Red Sea. For just as He divided the supernal waters, separating them from the lower waters by means of the firmament, likewise did He gather the lower waters by means of the wind.
“’and the dry land shall be seen’” – that is to say, the land created together with the supernal waters before light was created, as I explained above, whether a longer time before or a brief time.

Verse 10

“(and He called) the dry land <i>eretz</i> (“earth”) – as I explained above – the dry land is what is called “earth” throughout the Torah.

Verse 11

“<i>deshe</i>” – all types of grasses together are called “<i>deshe</i>”, and each kind by itself is called “<i>’eisev</i>”
“making fruit for its kind” – according to the straightforward sense, “<i>l’mino</i>” was said regarding the grasses. For “<i>l’mino</i>” stated regarding trees making fruit is referring also to the <i>eisev</i> seeding its seed.
“making fruit by its kind” – an apple tree makes apples and not dates.
“whose seed is in it” – inside the apple there are seeds from which can be planted a tree for all kinds of fruit.”


Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

“let there be luminaries” – it is the way of Scripture to use a singular [verb form] in place of plural, like “And there were (singular form) men who were impure”. Its meaning is: There was an event – and what was it? Luminaries.
“in the firmament of the heaven” – which was beaten out and spread under the supernal heavens.
“in the firmament” – since it is attached to the word following it, that is to say, the firmament <b>of<</b> the heavens, therefore it is vocalized with a <i>chataf</i>. Similarly with [the word] <i>katzir</i> (“harvest”) – when it is attached, it will say, “until the end of the barley harvest (<i>k’tzir</i> and the wheat harvest (<i>k’tzir</i>. We have already said above: “To differentiate between day and night” – we have already said above “and G-d divided between the light and the darkness”, but still, the actual end of night and beginning of day is not known except by sunrise, and similarly, the end of day and the beginning of night is not known except by sunset and [when] the starts come out – to distinguish between the beginning of the day and the beginning of the night.
“And they will be for signs and for appointed times” – as it is written regarding Hezekiah, “this will be for you a sign from Hashem, etc….the shadow will go ten steps etc…” – behold, the sun was for him a sign… “I’ve set wonders in the heavens and upon the land, blood and fire, etc…” and it is written, “do not fear the signs of heaven”.
“And for appointed times” – from the path of the moon, which is renewed every 29 ½ days, the appointed days of the year and the dates for legal documents are known, as it is written, “He made the moon for appointed times”
“and for days” – for behold, from one appearance of starts until the next is one day.
“and years” – four seasons of the year constituted a complete year.

Verse 15

“and they shall be for luminaries” – they will serve to illuminate the world.

Verse 16

“the small” – of the two great luminaries

Verse 17



Verse 18

“And to distinguish between light and dark” – between the beginning of light and the beginning of dark. Sunrise is the beginning of light; the appearance of stars is the beginning of dark.

Verse 19



Verse 20

“will fly upon the earth” – even though the creation of fowls was from the water, their growth and life will be upon the earth.


Verse 21

“The great crocodiles” – even though the Holy One said, “let them swarm”, referring to the fishes which are not so large, nevertheless, He also created the crocodiles, mentioned elsewhere, with them – “Leviathan – the straight serpent, and Leviathan, the crooked serpent”, spoken of in the prophets, as well as in Job: “Shall you drawn Leviathan on your hook?”

Verse 22

“G-d  blessed them “ – you find that He blessed all forms of life – fishes and birds, man and beasts domestic and wild.
“Fill the waters” – [<i>mil’u</i> is] a command form of the simple (non-intensive) pattern, similar to “Say <i>imru</i> to G-d”, “Chase <i>ridfu</i> quickly”, but <i>mal’u</i> is the command form for the intensified pattern, such as “Speak <i>dabb’ru</i> to the entire assembly of the children of Israel”, “Strengthen <i>chazz’ku</i> weak hands.
“Will multiply” – [&lt;<i>yirev</i> is]similar to <i>yirbeh</i>, and like [<i>yifen</i> is] similar to <i>yifneh</i>. Similarly all simple verbs ending with <i>hey</i>, such as <i>panah, kanah, banah, machah</i>, it will say <i>vayifen, vayiken, vayiven, vayimach</i> 

Verse 23



Verse 24

“And the creatures of the earth” – [<i>chayto</i> similar to “a fountain (<i>ma’yano</i>) of water”, “the son of  (<i>b’no</i>) Be’or”, with an extra <i>vav</i>
“And it was so” – that is to say: thus it was forever


Verse 25



Verse 26

“and He said” – to His angels
“Let us make man” – like we find with Michayahu ben Yimla in Kings, and in Yeshayahu, “Who shall I send, who will go for <u>us</u>”, and also in Job.
“after our likeness” – regarding our minds. Behold, when a person sins [lit. – “is ruined”], it is written, “he is compared, he is likened to a beast”
“and they shall rule” – <i>urdu</i>, from <i>radah</i> like <i>vaya’asu</i> (“they shall do”) is from <i>asah</i>; <i>bakhah</i> - <i>vayivkhu</i>,; <i>shavah</i>, - <i>vayishbu</i>

Verse 27

“in his image” – the image of man – that was made in the image of <i>elohim</i> - angels. Now don’t be surprised that the creation of angels was not made explicit, for Moshe wrote here neither angels, nor Gehenna, nor the Work of the Chariot, but rather those things we see in the world and are mentioned in the Ten Commandments, for that’s the reason for [recounting] all of the Work of the six days, as I explained above.
“male and female He created them” – as it makes explicit later on: “and He took one of his sides” – general, followed by specific (<i>klal ufrat</i>). And thus did I find in the 32 Rules of Interpretation [for narrative passages] of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosi the Galilean, who learned the rule of <i>klal ufrat</i> from this verse.


Verse 28

“and subdue it” – non-intensified, like “and the land was subdued before them”. Now since it is a command form in a non-intensified pattern, therefore [the word is] non-intensified, but <i>kibshuha</i> [the same word with an intensifying mark in the middle letter] is a past-tense form, like “collect (<i>kibb’tzu</i>) [in a] bowl”.

Verse 29

“behold, I have given to you” – I am giving to you now, <i>doinas</i> [in Old French]. And similarly, “I have raised my hand” – I am raising; “I have given the money for the field” - I am giving.

Verse 30

“for all the beasts of the earth, etc.” – but flesh was not permitted to the first man, until Noach came and [G-d] said to him, “like the vegetables and grasses, I have given to you everything”.

Verse 31

“And it was evening, and it was morning” – then was the sixth day completed, as well as the [entire] beginning.
“and G-d saw everything that He had made and behold, it was very good” – He looked carefully at all of His work and all of His actions which He had done [to see] if there was anything in them which needed perfecting, and behold, all were beautiful and perfected.

Verse 1

(1) ADONAI APPEARED TO HIM. How? In that three men came to him who were angels. For in many places where an angel appears, it refers to him in language of Sh'china [divinity], as it is written (Ex. 23:20-21) "[I am sending an angel] ... since My Name is in him" -- His messenger is like Him. Similarly (Ex. 3:2)), "An angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire out of a bush" and it is written there (v.4), "When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to look ...." 
(2) IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY. What was the need to write "the day"? To inform you, because with respect to Lot, it is written (Gen. 19:1), "The two angels arrived in Sodom in the evening," and for that reason Lot said to them (v.2), "turn aside to your servant’s house to spend the night," but Avraham, because they came to him in the heat of the day, in the morning, when it is not normal for wayfarers to spend the night, but rather to eat and to move on, thus he did not speak to them or spending the night, but (18:5), "that you may refresh yourselves; then go on."

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

SEEING THAT [KI AL KEN] YOU HAVE COME YOUR SERVANT’S WAY. Likewise (Gen. 19:8), "since they have come under the shelter of my roof" -- because that [asher] they have come. It is the practice of Scripture to omit "asher" in most cases.

Verse 6

CHOICE FLOUR.  Wheat flour, for wherever it says "solet," it is from wheat, as is expounded from the consecration offering, where it is written (Ex. 29:2), "make these of choice wheat flour" [solet hitim].

Verse 7

THEN ABRAHAM RAN TO THE HERD.  Since he told them (v.5) "a morsel of bread," a small quantity, since their journey required them to go, he had to run and hurry, since he said to them a little and he did much.  All this was written to recount Abraham's importance [magnanimity].

Verse 8



Verse 9

WHERE IS YOUR WIFE SARAH?  They asked even though they knew, just as we find with the Sh'china [God Himself], Who said to Adam (Gen. 3:9), "Where are you?"  Likewise with Bil'am (Num. 22:9): "Who are these people with you?"  And similarly Isaiah, who knew, asked Hizkiyahu about the messengers of Evil-Merodach [actually, Merodach-baladan -- see Isa. 39:1-4].  And all of this is by way of opening conversation.

Verse 10

(1) KA'ET HAYAH. At the time for giving birth [i.e., after nine months], as it is written (Micah 5:2), "at the time of giving birth she has given birth." And likewise in halacha, it is called yoledet. And somewhat similarly is (Ex. 1:19), "ki hayot heina" [JPS: "they are vigorous"'; alt.: "they are giving birth"] similar to a midwife.

Verse 14

IS TOO WONDROUS FOR ADONAI Who sent us to you ANYTHING. And likewise: (Gen. 19:23-24) "Adonai rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulfurous fire from Adonai out of heaven" -- the first [mention of God] in the verse is Gavriel, and the second in the verse is the Holy One, blessed be He. And it is so stated explicitly in the Agada book [Gen. R. 51:2].

HAS SENT US.  The strong structure [binyan pi'el].  And even though every "sending" of emissaries and their returning is written "vayishlah" in the weak structure [binyan kal], in the case of these, it is written in the strong structure, because this is a "shiluah" (letting go) of destruction, as it is written (Deut. 32:24), "fanged beasts will I let loose (ashalah -- binyan pi'el) against them"; (Ps. 78:45) "He inflicted (y'shalah -- binyan pi'el) upon them swarms of insects."

DO NOT LOOK BEHIND.  Because of the distress of your sons-in-law who are in the city.  And further, because one who looks back is delayed on the journey.  And also that one should not watch angels and their activities unnecessarily, as it is written (Jud. 13:22),  "We shall surely die, because we have seen God."  And likewise Ya'akov (Gen. 32:31), "For I have seen God face to face, and my life has been spared."

And this is the meaning when it writes (Deut. 26:5), "My father was a wandering Aramean" -- because he was exiled from there, it is because of "[God] made me wander."  And "oveid avi" is a synonym, as it is written (Ps. 119:176), "I have strayed [ta'iti] like a lost [oved] sheep" [and] (Jer. 50:6) "My people were lost [ovdot] sheep; their shepherds led them astray [hit'um]."

Verse 16

(1) AND TO SARAH HE SAID.  Words of appeasement and consolation:  "After all, I took you initially not by compulsion and not by force, but by the customary practice of marriage, for I gave the bride-price and gift of 1000 shekels to your brother, because I was under the understanding that he was your brother, as you told me.  And this is not the gift of "sheep and oxen" that Avimelech gave Avraham at the end (v.14), but rather before he brought her to his house.  For even about Par'oh, who was punished more harshly, it is written (Gen. 12:16), "And he treated Avram well because of her" before the wedding, and all the more so with Avimelech.  
(2) I HAVE GIVEN A THOUSAND PIECES OF SILVER. From the beginning, as it is written regarding Par'oh, and as it is written (Gen. 34:12), "Ask of me a bride-price and gift ever so high," and as it is written (Gen. 24:53), "and he gave presents to her brother and her mother."  ...
(3) THIS WILL SERVE YOU AS VINDICATION BEFORE ALL WHO ARE WITH YOU AND BEFORE EVERYONE.  The thousand pieces of silver that I gave your brother previously is a great honor to you, and a vindication to all the members of your household who are with you and to the entire world, so that people will not look at you disrespectfully, saying, "This woman Avimelech treated as freely available," for everyone will know that he took her in a respectable way, and that it was by compulsion that he returned her.  ...
(4) VINDICATION [K'SUT EINAYIM].  That people will not look at you disrespectfully, as it is written (Exod. 10:5), "It shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land."  And when people look at a person to disgrace him, it is written (Ezek. 28:17) "to stare at," (Mic. 7:10) "my eyes shall behold her," and (Mic. 4:11) "let our eyes gaze on Zion."  ...
(5) YOU ARE CLEARED [V'NOCHAHAT].  Publicized and argued [mitvakahat] well, that I treated you respectfully, and do not think of me unfavorably.  That is the essence according to the plain meaning, for Avimelech said all of this in respect for Sarah, and not to criticize or reprove her.

(1) HE WAS WEANED.  He was separated from the nipples, as it says (I Sam. 1:23), "until you have weaned him."  
(2) ON THE DAY OF WEANING.  That he made a feast, as we find in connection with Sh'mu'el, that when she weaned him, she brought him to Shiloh, and sacrifices with him.

Verse 9

PLAYING [M'TZAHEK].  He had already become substantially older, and she did not want to have him remain there longer, lest he come to want to take from the estate of his father along with Yitz'hak.

Verse 12

OFFSPRING SHALL BE CONTINUED FOR YOU [WILL BE CALLED "OFFSPRING" FOR YOU.]  The covenant that I established with your offspring, to give them the Land of Canaan, as it is written (Gen. 15:13), "your offspring shall be strangers etc."  It is with regard to Yitz'hak that I made promises to  you.

Verse 13



Verse 14

SHE WANDERED ABOUT IN THE WILDERNESS OF BEER-SHEBA and it was for that reason that (v.15) THE WATER WAS GONE FROM THE SKIN, for had she gone by a straight route, the water skin that Avraham gave her would have sufficed for her as far as the inn.

BOWMAN [ROVEH KASHET].  Pulling on the bow.  And there are two roots -- (Gen. 49:23) "[archers] bitterly assailed and shot [robu]" and also (Job 16:13) "His bowmen [rabav] surrounded me"  are from language of RBB, just as "walk around [sovu]" (Ps. 48:13) is from SBB, (Jer. 2:12) "Be appalled [somu] heavens" from SMM, (Isa. 23:2) "Moan [domu], you coastland dwellers" from (I Kings 19:12) "a soft murmuring [d'mamah] sound."  All of these have a doubled last letter [of the root].  But "roveh" [in our verse] is from the root "ravah" -- [like] "asah," "banah," "kanah," from which one says [in the present tense] "oseh," "boneh," "koneh."

Chapter 22



Verse 1

(1) AFTER [AHAR] THESE MATTERS. Wherever it says "Ahar these matters," it is tied to the section immediately above. "Ahar these matters" -- when Avram killed the kings -- the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, "Do not be afraid, Avram" (Gen. 15:1) of the nations. "And it was ahar [actually, "aharei"] these matters" -- the birth of Yitz'hak -- "that Avraham was told, etc. , and B'tu'el fathered Rivka" (Gen. 22:20-23). Likewise (Esth. 3:1): "Ahar these matters" -- that Mordechai informed about Bigtan and Teresh -- "King Ahashveirosh elevated Haman" who wanted to kill Mordechai, but the fact that he [Mordechai] had saved the king availed Mordechai and Haman was impaled. So here: "Ahar the matters" -- that Avraham had made a covenant with Avimelech, him and Avraham's grandson and great-grandson (Gen. 21:23) [actually, with him and his (Avimelech's) grandson and great-grandson], and he [Avraham] gave him seven ewes, and the Holy One, blessed be He, had become angry because of this, because the Philistines' land had been given to Avraham, and also, in connection with Yehoshua, lots were cast for the five districts of the Philistines (Josh. 13:3, 14:2) as part of the lots of Israel, and the Holy One, blessed be He, had commanded regarding them (Deut. 20:16), "do not let a soul remain alive," and therefore, 
(2) GOD TRIED AVRAHAM. He rebuked him and vexed him, as it is written (Job 4:2), "If one ventures a word with you, will it be too much?"; (Exod. 17:7) "because they tried Adonai," "Massah and Meribah"; (Ps. 26:2) "Probe me, Adonai, and try me." In other words, you took excessive pride in the son whom I gave you, to make a covenant between all of you and their [the Philistines'] descendants. so now go and offer him up and see what this making of a covenant has gained for you. And afterward, I found the same idea in Midrash Sh'mu'el: : "The Ark of the LORD remained in the territory of the Philistines seven months." (I Sam. 6:1). It is written (Gen. 21:30), "You are to accept these seven ewes from me." The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, "You gave him seven ewes! By your life, his descendants will wage seven wars against your descendants and will defeat them." Another matter: "By your life, his descendants will kill these seven righteous ones among your descendants: Shimshon, Hofni, Pinhas, Shaul, and his three sons." Another matter: "By your life, his descendants will destroy these seven dwellings: the tent of meeting, Gilgal, Nov, Shiloh, Giv'on, and the Temple, twice. Another matter: the Ark wandered in the Philistine territory for seven months....

(1) GER V'TOSHAV ANOCHI. I have come from a foreign land to dwell here, and I have settled with you. Thus, I have no ancestral burial plots here. 
(2) GIVE ME A BURIAL SITE. Allow me to acquire land here and agree, all you city residents, to permit me to bury my dead from my family. For a burial site can exist only with the agreement of all city residents, and the text here shows this, when Avraham gave the money to Efron, [the field] (vv. 17-18) "passed to Avraham as his possession." And after that (vv. 19-20), "Avraham buried [Sarah]" and the field passed "to Avraham as a burial site from" all "the Hittites." ...
(3) MIL'FANAI [FROM BEFORE ME].  I will take it out from before me to bury it.

Verse 1

1 He was advanced in years.  This is to say, the time had come to marry off his son during his lifetime.
2. And God blessed Abraham [with everything] - this is to inform/explain to us about what is said in [the text in] front of us, that Abraham did not send his servant to take a wife [for Isaac] on account of lack of women in the Land of Canaan or because no one wanted to mate with him, because Abraham had been blessed with everything and the entire world desired to mate with Isaac, but because he only wanted a spouse for Isaac from his family.  This is why Abraham's servant said: "And Adonai blessed my master very much and he has become wealthy."  And it is for this reason that the text needed to explain first that God had blessed Abraham "with everything," as in a similar instance: "And Ham was the father of Canaan" (Genesis 9:18).  

Verse 2

PUT YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH.  And similarly with Yosef when he swore to Ya'akov.  The making of a covenant or an oath of a son, or of a slave to his master was in this fashion, for they shared the aspect of subjugation, and it is thus written (Mal. 1:6), "A son should honor his father, and a slave his master."  However, handshaking or cutting an object in two for a covenant and passing between the pieces is found with other persons.

Verse 3



Verse 4

BUT TO MY LAND.  And not to those who are not my relatives, but rather to MY KINFOLK who are in my land you should go.

Verse 5

SHALL I THEN TAKE YOUR SON BACK.  To the land of your ancestors; even though Avraham's descendant had not been there, [the text] calls it "returning" because Avraham had been there.

Verse 6



Verse 7

ADONAI  THE GOD OF HEAVEN.  Who brought me here and gave my descendants this land, I know that He does not want to separate my descentants from here, for if He did, why would the Holy One, blessed be He, want to bring me here?  ...
Therefore, I know that He will send His angel to make Your way prosper, to fulfill His promise to me.

PLACE FOR US TO SPEND THE NIGHT.  A place for us in your house.  And why do we need it?  
for lodging, for a place to spend the night.  It is a noun, like (Deut. 25:1), "When there is a dispute [riv] between people," from (Gen. 31:36) "he took up his grievance with [vayarev] Laban."  [Another example of such a noun is] (Deut. 17:8) "Between civil law claim and defense [bein din l'din]."  It [lalin] is a noun from (Gen. 32:14) "he spent the night [vayalen] there."  But when she said (v.25), "also room to spend the night [lalun]," its meaning is "a place for your bodies to spend the night," as in (Gen. 31:35) "to rise" [lakum] or (Ex. 4:31), "to return to Egypt" [lashuv].  If she had said  "also a place for you" as they did, "a place for us," she shoud have said "lalin" as they did, as the meaning would have been "also a place for you" for what? "as a place of lodging."  But "lalun" would not need any explanation, for the meaning would be "a place for people to spend the night [lalun]."  This is the essential meaning, for one who is precise in Hebrew grammar.

(1) It is common courtesy to say such.  Even though the Holy One, blessed be He, desires this union, they nevertheless said to her, "Will you go with this man, or with another person after a year or ten months, for, as we have learned, it was customary to give a virgin 12 months to equip herself.  ...

Verse 61



Verse 62

YITZHAK HAD JUST COME BACK FROM THE VICINITY.  As in (Gen. 10:19) "as far as S'dom."  Yitzhak, on the same day when the slave arrived, had come from the well of Be'er L'hai Ro'i.  
(2) For Yitzhak was living in the land of the Negev, which was where Be'er L'hai Ro'i was, as it is written (Gen. 16:7), "the spring on the road to Shur," and it is written (Gen. 20:1), "Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negeb and settled between Kadesh and Shur."  And because he came from there on that day, and he did not know what his workers were doing, and they were planting gardens and orchards,  

Verse 63

YITZHAK WENT OUT LASUAH IN THE FIELD.  As it is written (Gen. 2:5), "all the shrubs [siah] of the field," in other words, to plant trees and to see after matters of his workers.  And then, when he was in the field, he saw the camels coming, and he went to meet them, to see whether they were his fathers camels, which the slave was driving.

THESE WERE THE YEARS OF THE LIFE OF YISHMAEL.  The Sages explained in Megilla, "Why were Yishma'el's years enumerated?  And according to the plain meaning, out of respect for Avraham.  Since the time of his birth is specified (Gen. 16:16), "Avraham [sic] was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Yishmael," and the time of his circumcision, as it is written (Gen. 17:25), "his son Yishmael was thirteen years old, etc.," it now goes back and specifies all the days of his life.

Verse 18

THEY CAMPED [LIT.:  FELL] ALONGSIDE ALL THEIR KINSMEN.  They dwelt, as it is written (Gen. 16:12), "He will dwell alongside all his kinsmen."

Verse 19

(1) THIS IS THE STORY OF ISAAC ... ABRAHAM BEGOT ISAAC. According to the plain sense of the scripture, since it says above regarding Yishma'el (v.25), "Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian bore." But here, Yitz'hak was Avraham's principal son, as he begat Yitz'hak from his full wife, as it is written (Gen. 21:12), "for it is through Yitz'hak that your progeny will be accounted." And likewise in (I) Chronicles, after it wrote (1:28) that the sons of Avraham were Yitz'hak and Yishma'el, and (1:32) about the sons of Keturah, it goes back and writes flatly (1:34), "Avraham begat Yitz'hak."

(3) AND TWO L'UMIM. Kingdoms, as it is written (Ps. 148:11), "All kings of the earth and all l'umim" -- this is duplicative language. But "umim" is peoples. And since the prophet had begun to tell her, he finished and specified all of the future events. 
(4) AND THE OLDER SHALL SERVE THE YOUNGER. And that is why you love Ya'akov, because the Holy One, blessed be He, loves him, as it is written (Mal. 1:2), "I love Ya'akov."

Verse 5

(1) BECAUSE AVRAHAM HEARKENED TO MY VOICE.  Regarding the Akeidah, as it is written (22:18), "Because you hearkened to my voice."  
(2) AND KEPT MY CHARGE.  For example, circumcision, about which it is written (17:9), "You shall keep my covenant."  
(3) MY COMMANDMENTS.  For example, the commandment of the eight days [of circumcision], as it is written (21:4), "as God had commanded him."  
(4) MY LAWS AND MY TEACHINGS.  According to the basic plain meaning, the deducible laws, such as theft, sexual sins, coveting, civil laws, and hospitality, all of which were practiced before the Giving of the Torah, but were renewed and explained to Israel, and they made a covenant to affirm them.

(1) WHEN SOME TIME HAD PASSED.  After this time, he did not take so much care to avoid conducting himself with his wife in a marital manner, since they had not evinced intent to steal her from him.

Intercourse, as it is written (Gen. 39:17), "The Hebrew slave whom you brought into our house came to me to dally with me [l'tzahek bi]," and elsewhere (Gen. 39:14) it says, "[to dally with -- l'tzahek -- us] This one came to lie [lishkav] with me."

Verse 24



Verse 25

HIS SERVANTS STARTED DIGGING A WELL.  But Yitzhak did not name it, until, ultimately, Avimelech came to him from G'rar and each took an oath to the other, and then his servants came and told him about the well that they had dug, and then he called it Shiv'ah, for the oath [sh'vu'ah] that he and Avimelech swore.

Verse 26

(1) AHUZZATH HIS COUNCILOR [ALT.: A CONTINGENT OF HIS ALLIES]. As in Targum Onkelos: a group of his friends. As in (Jud. 15:6), "He gave her to his friend." The mem is like the mem of "meria v'tokea" [he sounds and blows (the shofar)], and like the mem of (Jer. 21:4) "I am going to turn around the weapons." Likewise (Prov. 12:26), "A righteous man gives his friend direction, But the way of the wicked leads astray" -- the righteous one will give direction to and guide on the straight path his fellows, ["give direction to"] is like (Num. 13:2), "they will scout the land of Canaan -- but the way of the wicked, for themselves and their neighbors, leads astray, "fait esgarer" in the vernacular.  "Yatur" (like Num. 13:2) is intransitive; "yater" (Prov. 12:26) is transitive, like "yashuv" and "yashiv" and "yakum" and "yakim" -- one is "po'el" [binyan kal], and the other "maf'il" [binyan hif'il].


Verse 27



Verse 28

LET THE SWORN TREATY that [already] exists BETWEEN US -- between me and your father, let it continue now [between us and you], since that was a term [of the treaty] (Gen. 21:23):  "lest you betray me or my descendants."

Verse 29

(1) YOU, NOW, BLESSED OF ADONAI, similarly: make a covenant with us and let us leave in peace, as we have done with you.  
(2) YOU.  So that you.  
(3) BLESSED OF ADONAI.  Similar to "Come, blessed of Adonai," written about Lavan.  And that is what Yitzhak did (v. 31), "they departed from him in peace."

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

THEREFORE THE NAME OF THE CITY IS BEERSHEVA.  This is not the same Beersheva as with Avraham (see Gen. 21:31), for there were two Beershevas, as it is written (I Kings 19:3), "He came to Beersheva that is in Judea."

Verse 34

(1) WHEN ESAV WAS 40 YEARS OLD.  And Yitzhak was then 100 years old, as he was 60 years old when Rivka bore them.  This comes to inform us [regarding] what is written afterwrds (27:1), "When Isaac was old."  HE TOOK YEHUDIT AS A WIFE, ETC.

Verse 35

AND THEY WERE A SOURCE OF BITTERNESS.  Because in the future [Rivka] would say (Gen. 27:46), "If Jacob marries a Hittite woman like these."  Therefore, it has to explain at the beginning.  SOURCE OF BITTERNESS [MORAT RUAH].  As from "oseh" for a male one would say (Ps. 148:8) "executes [osah] His command" for a female, and, in the construct state, one would say "osat," similarly, one would say from "hamoreh," an expression of "mamreh" [rebelling], from (Josh. 1:18) "flouts [yamreh] your commands," one would say "morah" for a female, and, in the construct state, one says "morat ruah," "contrarientes" in the vernacular.  However, (Prov. 14:10) "the heart knows its bitterness" [morat nafsho] [is vocalized under the mem with] a hataf-kamatz [our kamatz katan] since it is a noun, an expression of bitterness [m'rirut], but here, [vocalized with] a m'lapom, it is a verb, from the same root as (Lam. 1:20) "I have disobeyed" [maro mariti], where the third letter of the root is weak.

Chapter 27



Verse 1

HIS EYES WERE TOO DIM TO SEE.  Because of old age, as we find in the Book of Samuel (I Sam. 3:2), "his eyes had begun to fail" [chehot].

Verse 2

PLEASE [HINEH NA, JPS: NOW].  I request from you, because I have grown old, and I want to give you the blessings, which I have to apportion to you, during my life, as is written in connection with Avraham, regarding the apportioning of the land.

Verse 3

(1) TAKE YOUR GEAR.  It duplicates, with a second "na" here, as I have explained in connection  with (Gen. 12:11-13) "I now [na] know that you are a beautiful woman."  
(2) YOUR QUIVER [TEL'Y'CHA].  The container in which your arrows are hanging.  
(3) TEL'Y'CHA.  From the same root as (Gen. 40:22), "they hanged [talu] the chief baker," and similarly (Jud. 5:12) "your captives [shev'y'cha], son of Avinoam" from the root "sh'veh."

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

WITH ADONAI'S APPROVAL.  In the name of Adonai.  However, (Gen. 10:9) "Nimrod a mighty hunter before Adonai [lif'nei Adonai]" [means] "in the entire world."  Similarly (Jonah 3:3) "Nineveh was an enormously large [leilohim] city" [means] in the entire world of the Holy One, blessed be He -- there was no city as great as Nineveh.

Verse 8



Verse 9

(1) GO TO THE FLOCK.  From the place of his normal activities, as he (Gen. 25:27) "dwelt in tents" [i.e., was a shepherd -- see Rashbam there].  
(2) TWO GOAT KIDS.  For their skins, since their hair is tough, like human hair.  [Thus,] he took goats and not sheep.

Verse 10

Verse 12

MY FATHER MAY GROPE ME.  From (Deut. 28:29), "grope at noon."  Similar to (Job. 40:22), "the willows of the brook surround him [y'sobuhu]" from S-B-B, with a dagesh in place of the missing letter [the second bet].

Verse 19

EAT OF MY GAME.  [The alef has] a hataf-kamatz [our kamatz katan], because it is an imperative, like (Eccl. 9:7), "Eat [echol] your bread in joy."  However, (v.25) "I will eat [v'ochla] of my son's game" is [vocalized with] a m'lapom and is an expression of "I will do."  It is similar to how, from (Ps. 132:1) "Remember [z'chor, the ordinary imperative], Adonai, for David," one says (II Chron. 6:42) "Remember [zochrah, like our "ochlah"] the loyalty of David," an imperative.

(1) THE ODOR OF HIS CLOTHES.  His best.  And their clothes were scented with incense.  
(2) THAT ADONAI HAS BLESSED.  The field that is full of (Song 4:14) "Nard and saffron, Fragrant reed and cinnamon."  And R' Eliezer HaKalir wrote similarly [in a piyyut for dew], "The blessed field, when He smelled [it], He blessed it with the gift of dew."

Verse 28

MAY [GOD] GIVE YOU.  This refers back to (v. 27) "[the field] that Adonai has blessed."  And this means that the Holy One, blessed be He, will give you, above, "from the dew of heavens," like the blessing [in v. 27]  of the field.  

Verse 29

YOUR MOTHER'S SONS.  However, regarding [the blessing that] Ya'akov [gave to Yehudah], it is written (Gen. 49:8), "Your father's sons shall bow down to you."

Verse 33

(1) YITZHAK TREMBLED.  because he had found hair on the nape of Ya'akov's neck.  
(2) WHO WAS IT, THEN.  A turn of phrase like "izi" [well; then] in the Talmud, like (B.M. 70a) "Tell me, then, ...."  "Atores" in the vernacular.  ...
(3) NOW HE MUST REMAIN BLESSED.  Because he was prompt to serve me.  And he [Yitzhak] also knew that he [Ya'akov] had done all this on Rivka's advice, and that she recognized that he [Ya'akov] was worthy of the blessing.

Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36

WAS HE, THEN, NAMED YA'AKOV.  A question.  Was it because he was named Ya'akov when he was born, because his hand grabbed my heel, I being the b'chor and he the regular son and thus due to inherit less than I, should he take twice my share?  Similarly (Gen. 29:15), "And because you are my kinsman" and you should receive substantial compensation, "should you work for nothing?" -- as a rhetorical question.  Similarly in Bava Batra (139b), "  [In the case of] one who dies ..., if the estate is large, the sons inherit [it], and the daughters are maintained [from it]. [If] the estate is small, the daughters are maintained [from it], and the sons shall go begging.  Admon said, 'And because I am a male'" and treated well if the estate is large, I'm to be treated badly if the estate is small?  A rhetorical question.

WHEN EISAV SAW THAT YITZHAK HAD BLESSED YA'AKOV.  In these latter blessings he gave him the land of Canaan, which had been given to Avraham, and he also told him to marry a woman from his family, and commanded him not to marry one of the Canaanite women, Eisav thought to himself, "My marrying from among the Canaanite women robbed me of Avraham's blessing," and he married "THE DAUGHTER OF YISHMAEL," of the family "OF AVRAHAM."

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

THE SISTER OF NEVAYOT.  Because he [Nevayot] was the first of Yishmael's sons, it calls her the sister of Nevayot.  Similarly (Exod. 15:20), "Then Miriam the prophet, Aharon’s sister" -- because Aharon was born before Moshe, it calls her Aharon's sister.  However, where it refers to Moshe and Aharon in a single verse, it calls her "their sister," as it is written (Num. 26:59), "she bore to Amram Aharon and Moshe and their sister Miriam."  Similarly (Gen. 36:22), "Lotan’s sister Timna," because he [Lotan] was the oldest, as it is written (Gen. 36:20), "Lotan, Shovel, Tziv'on, Anah."

Verse 10

HE WENT HARAN-WARDS. In the direction of Haran.

Verse 11


(2) FOR THE SUN WAS SETTING.  And he did not have time to enter the city in daylight.  As Rav Yehuda said (Pes. 2a), "A person should enter [the city] at [the time of] "It was good" [i.e., during daytime] and should leave at "it was good."  ...
(3) AND HE TOOK one ...
(4) OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE as it is written (v.18) "He took the stone that he had placed under his head."

Sure the Eternal is in this place - Not as I have thought when I lay down there, that this was a profane place, but yes, it is a holy place. And so too all [mentions of] "achen" that are in Scripture [mean] Ah yes! This is not what I thought. And likewise: Surely, the matter is known!

(3) THIS ONE TOO.  Immediately.  
(4) FOR THE WORK THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH ME.  After the wedding with Rahel.  
(5) ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS.  As it is written (Gen. 30:25), "After Rahel had borne Yosef, Ya'akov said to Lavan, 'Give me leave etc.,'" for it was at that point that he had completed the 14 years for his [Lavan's] two daughters.

Verse 30

[HE ALSO SLEPT WITH RAHEL,] AND HE LOVED RAHEL ALSO [MORE THAN LEAH].  And he also loved her more than Leah; in other words, he slept with her and he also loved her.  Most instances of "gam" [also] are thus inverted in the Torah.  Similarly (Exod. 12:32), "And bless me too" -- also bless me.  Similarly (Num. 22:33), "You also I would have killed" -- Look, I pressed your legs and made you limp and lame, and now I also would have killed you.  

Verse 31

BUT RAHEL WAS BARREN.  Because it is written below (Gen. 30:1) that she said to Ya'akov, “Give me children, or I shall die.”

Chapter 30



Verse 1

I SHALL DIE.  The accent is below [ultimate] because this is in the future tense.  But in "Rahel died, to my sorrow" (Gen. 48:7), the accent is above [penultimate], because it is in the past tense.

WHAT LUCK.  Good fortune has come to us.  As in (Isa. 65:11), "Who set a table for Luck."  Likewise in Tractate Shabbat: (67b) "Luck has struck; don't be tired."  Also in Gen. R. (71:12, on this verse):  "The luck of our house has arrived."  And one who explains it as an expression of a battalion [g'dud] is mistaken, for even though the names are [only] in the nature of the statement -- as in Re'uven, "The Lord has seen," Shim'on, "The Lord has heard" -- we write it down only in the nature of the main idea of what is said, and "gad" cannot be an expression of "g'dud" without a doubling, of two dalets.  "They band together [Yagodu] to do away with the righteous" (Ps. 94:21) has a dagesh in place of the missing second dalet.  Likewise (Ps. 106: 43) "they were brought low [vayamoku] by their iniquity"; (Job 30:12) "they build [vayasolu] their roads for my ruin"; and (Job 16:13) "His bowmen surrounded [yasobu] me."  In all of them, a dagesh is in place of a missing letter.

(1) GIFT [ZEVED].  A generous portion or share, based on the context.  
(2) WILL EXALT ME.  As in (I Kings 8:13), "I have now built for You a stately House," an expression of residence.

Verse 21

SHE NAMED HER DINAH.  And no expression of thanksgiving was written regarding the girl's birth, to make known why she was so named, for people do not give thanks for a girl as they do for a boy.  This comes to inform you that all of Ya'akov's children were males except for this one.  Likewise (Num. 26:46) "the name of Asher's daughter was Serah."  Among all the 70 persons there were only two females, Yocheved and Serah.

Verse 22



Verse 23

GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY.  As in (Deut. 22:2), "you shall bring it home," and as in (Jer. 16:5), "I have withdrawn my favor."  You have brought inside and secreted my disgrace, that I was called barren.

Verse 24

SHE NAMED HIM YOSEF.  Because she said (v.23), "God has taken away [asaf] my disgrace."  If so, she should call him "Asaf"!  Why the yod of Yosef?  Because she prayed, "May the LORD add another son for me."  Thus, this name serves for two separate statements: asaf and yosef.

Verse 31

PAY ME NOTHING. out of the flock that you have now, for I have served you in return for your daughters.  But for my herding your flock from here on out, give me the streaked and the speckled.  And remove those streaked and speckled that are currently in your flock and place them in the possession of your sons; it is for you to separate them from those that will be born from this point on, which will be my payment.

Verse 32

(1) SPECKLED (NAKOD).  It seems to me [that this means] spotted on the crown and the neck, for "he bowed low to the ground" (vayikod -- Ex. 34:8) is bending the neck and the crown.  It (vayikod) has a dagesh [in the koph] because it is like "vayipol" from the root n-p-l.  And "nakod" is from "vayikod," on acount of the crown ("kodkod"), in the same manner as "akod" [refers to streaks] on the foot, on account of "he bound (vaya'akod) Yitzhak" (Gen. 22:9), a binding on the foot.  
(2) REMOVING FROM THERE for your own needs.  
(3) SHALL BE MY WAGES.  From here on, those that will be born.

Verse 33

(1) LET MY HONESTY TESTIFY FOR ME.  From today on.  
(2) [WHEN YOU GO OVER MY WAGES] BEFORE YOU.  When you come to view my wages, you will not find among them any except the spotted and streaked.  ...
(3) AND BROWN AMONG THE SHEEP.  But not among the goats, for most of them are brown, roux in the vernacular. 

Verse 34

Verse 36



Verse 37

(1) POPLAR SHOOT [MAKAL].  Because it (makal) is in the construct state -- a shoot [makel] of poplar, it is vocalized with a patah.  Similarly "ma'asar bakar" (Lev. 27:32) and "mispad tamrurim" (Jer. 6:26).  And when not in the construct state, "he struck the ass with a rod [makel]" (Num. 2:27), "lamenting [misped] in every square" (Amos 5:16), and "a tenth of a tenth [ma'aser min hama'aser]" (Num. 18:26).  
(2) FRESH.  Not dry.   
(3) LAYING BARE.  Exposing, as in "bared [hasufa] arm" (Ezek. 4:7) and "Adonai will bare [hasaf] His holy arm" (Isa. 52:10).

Verse 38

THEY MATED [VAYEIHAMNAH].  Like (I. Sam. 6:12) "the cows went straight ahead [vayisharnah haparot]"; (Dan. 8:22) "four kingdoms will arise [ya'amodnah] out of a nation"; (Ezek. 37:7) "the bones came together [vatik'r'vu], bone to matching bone" -- half of each is masculine and half feminine.  For it should have said, for example, "The daughters of tzelof'had came forward [vatik'ravnah]."

Verse 39



Verse 40

YA'AKOV SEPARATED THE SHEEP.  He separated the streaked and the speckled from Lavan's flock for the first and second years, and he set the faces of Lavan's flock towards them, so that they [Lavan's flock] would see them and bear young like them.  And he would also place the rods in the water troughs.  He took these two actions so that they would bear streaked and speckled young.

Verse 41

[THE] CONNECTED [FLOCK] (JPS: THE STURDIER ANIMALS].  At the time when most of them regularly conceived together.

(1) TIMES (MONIM).  Minyanim (times).  
(2) TEN.  Not necessarily precisely.  As in (Lev. 26:26), "ten women [shall bake] your bread," (Job 19:3) "ten times [JPS: time and again] you humiliate me."  In other words, many times. 

Verse 8

THEN ALL THE FLOCKS WOULD DROP SPECKLED YOUNG.  In this way, it is clear that it was not "laying bare the white" (Gen. 30:37) that was effective.

Verse 9

TAKEN AWAY [VAYATZEL, LIT., "HE SAVED."]  He separated.  Similarly, all expressions of salvation [y'shu'ah], escape [ham'latah], and extraction [halitzah] are expressions of separation.

RACHEL STOLE THE HOUSEHOLD IDOLS.  So that they would not tell Lavan and inform him that Ya'akov wanted to flee, similarly to what is said (Hos. 3:4), "without ephod and oracle idols," and (Zech. 10:2), "For the oracle idols spoke delusion."  They regularly used them for augury.

A SEVEN DAYS' JOURNEY.  For Ya'akov went slowly, because of his flock, and Lavan, who was far from him, had gone to shear his flock, as it is written (Gen. 30:36), "he placed three days' distance between himself and Ya'akov," and he hastened to pursue him, and caught up with him after seven days.

(2) SNATCHED BY DAY [G'NUV'TI YOM].  The yod is extra -- g'nuvat yom ug'nuvat layla [those stolen by day and those stolen by night] I have reimbursed.  However, "g'nuvati" with a kamatz [under the bet], the meaning is my theft.

(1) HE COMMANDED THEM, SAYING [LEMOR]. He commanded them and said to them, "THUS  YOU SHALL SAY," and the messengers were not aware of Ya'akov's worry.  
 (2) I STAYED WITH LAVAN. As you know, at the instruction of my father and my mother.  This so that he [Esav] would not think, "He fled on account of me."

Verse 6



Verse 7

WE CAME TO YOUR BROTHER, ESAV.  and you have found favor in his eyes, as you said.  AND NOW he, out of his joy in your approach and his love for you IS COMING TO MEET YOU AND 400 MEN WITH HIM out of respect for you, and this is the plain sense.  Similarly (Ex. 4:14), "EVEN NOW HE IS SETTING OUT TO MEET YOU, AND HE WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU."

Verse 8

(1) YA'AKOV FEARED.  Internally.  Even though he [Ya'akov?] gave the messengers the impression that he [Esav] intended this out of respect, he [Ya'akov] did not believe that Esav's thinking was favorable, but was rather for ill.  
(2) HE WAS ANXIOUS [VAYETZER].  From the root of (Num. 25:17), "Assail the Midianites."  Similarly (Gen. 16:4), "her mistress was lowered [vateikal]," from k-l-l [to curse].  ...
(3) HE DIVIDED.  From (Num. 31:42), "which Moshe divided."

Verse 24



Verse 25


THERE WRESTLED an angel WITH HIM.  So that he could not flee, and so that fulfillment of the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, would be seen, that Esav would not harm him.

Verse 26

(1) HE COULD NOT PREVAIL AGAINST HIM. The angel [could not prevail] and he [Ya'akov] sought to cross and flee despite him [the angel]. ...
(2) IT WAS STRAINED. It became separated from the thigh, as in (Jer. 6:8) "Lest my sould be alienated from Thee" [Old JPS translation]. YERECH YA'AKOV. [In] "hayarech" (v. 33), the accent is ultimate, on the resh, for that is its name [i.e., that is the noun in its non-construct state.] Likewise (Num. 22;24) "gader mizeh" [a fence on this side], (Isa. 61:8) "gazel" [robbery]. And when "yarech" is in the construct state, there are changes so that [the vowel is] a patah katan [i.e., a segol] and the accent is on the first letter, "yerech Ya'akov," (Ex. 40:22) "yerech hamishkan" [the side of the Mishkan].


Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

YOU HAVE STRIVEN.  This is from the same root as (Hos. 12:4), "Grown to manhood, he strove [sarah] with a divine being," like "kanah - kanita," "asah - asita."  But (Hos. 12:5) "He strove [vayasar] with an angel and prevailed" is of the form "shav," "kam," "ratz," from which one would say, "vayakom," "vayashar," "vayarotz."  And the fact that Ya'akov was struck and was lamed was because the Holy One, blessed be He, promised him yet he fled.  And we find the same thing with all those who go on the road contrary to the wishes of the Holy One, blessed be He, or who refuse to go, that they are punished.  Regarding Moshe, it is written (Ex. 4:13), "make someone else Your agent," and (v.14), "The LORD became angry with Moses."  And according to the Rabbinic exposition (Zev. 102a), even though the Sages said, "Everywhere [in the Torah] where 'blazing anger' is mentioned, it makes an impression," here, what impression is there?  "There is your brother Aaron the Levite" (Ex. 4:14) -- he was to be the Levi, and you the Kohen; now, he will be the Kohen and you the Levi.  However, according to the plain sense, [the impression is that] because he [Moshe] was making excuses to avoid going, it is written (Ex. 4:24), "At a night encampment on the way, Adonai encountered him and sought to kill him."  Likewise with Yonah, who was swallowed into the belly of the fish.  And likewise with Bil'am (Num. 22:22), "But God was incensed at his going" and he became lame, as it is written (v.25), "squeezed Balaam’s foot against the wall," and (Num. 23:3), "And he went off shefi" - lame, as in (Job 33:21), "his bones rubbed away [shafu]."

Verse 18

(1) YA'AKOV CAME SHALEM.  To the city called Shalem.  
(2) THE CITY OF SH'CHEM.  Sh'chem's city, as in (Num. 21:26), "Now Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites," as it is written (Gen. 34:2), "Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, saw her."  And one who explains that "Sh'chem" is the name of the city is mistaken, for nowhere do we find "the city of Zion [or] Jerusalem" [ir tziyon y'rushalayim]," but rather "the city" [ha'ir] is mentioned after the name.  And even if this city was Sh'chem, perhaps it was in memory of the heroism of the sons of Ya'akov that they [afterward] named it Sh'chem, as is written about Luz (Gen. 28:19), that it was [re]named Beit El.  As it is written (Josh. 19:47), "they changed the name of Leshem to Dan, after their ancestor Dan," to commemorate their heroism when they killed the residents of the city.  And as it is written (Gen. 4:17), "he then founded a city, and named the city after his son Enoch."  And also one who explains "Shalem" as whole [shalem] in his Torah, whole in his wealth is mistaken according to the plain sense, for it is not the way of Scripture to speak this way, and also, what need would there be for this -- would the reduction [in wealth caused by] the gift to Esav necessitate writing this?  

Verse 19



Verse 20

EL-ELOHE-YISRAEL [God is the God of Israel].  In that He saved me from Lavan and from Esav, in other words, God is the God of Ya'akov in that He saved me from Lavan and from Esav.  And just as we name a person Eliezer [God is a help to me] or Imanu'el [God is with us], in the same way the altar is so named.  And the straightforward sense is as I have explained.

Verse 9

GIVE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO US, AND TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS FOR YOURSELVES.   In addressing Ya'akov's sons, they rested the intermarriage on their [Ya'akov's sons'] honor, to give and to take, but when they recounted the matter to the men of their town, they said it in reverse -- to the honor of the townsfolk, that they [the townsfolk] would be the takers and the givers, to induce them to listen to them and to be circumcised.

Verse 10

MOVE ABOUT [S'HARUHA].  Because the second letter in the root is a het, the vowel under it [in formations of this sort -- the imperfect or imperative with a suffix] is a kamatz..  Similarly, from G-A-L, "g'aleni" (Ps. 119:154); from SH-H-T, "vayish'hatuhu" (Jud. 12:6); from SH-A-L, "yish'aluni" (Isa. 58:2); from B-H-R, "b'haruhu"; and from P-A-L, "yif'aluhu."

Verse 16

(1) SOME DISTANCE.  As in (Job 34:24), "He shatters mighty men" and (Isa. 10:13), "And exiled their vast populations" -- an expression of magnitude.  And because of the great distance to Efrat, she was buried on the road.  
(2) VAT'KASH.  Like [the full form] "vat'kasheh."  As "vat'tzav" [you/she commanded] [is from] "vat'tzaveh" and "vat'chas" [you/she covered] [is from] "vat'chaseh."

Verse 17

HAVE NO FEAR, FOR IT IS ANOTHER BOY FOR YOU.  As you prayed (Gen. 30:24), "May Adonai add another son for me.  And He does not want to kill you; rather, He has accepted your prayer.  And her intent was to ease her [Rahel's] concerns.

Verse 18

ISRAEL FOUND OUT.  This was written only for purposes of informing you that it was because Ya'akov heard this that he said, when giving his final charge (Gen. 49:4), "Unstable as water, you shall excel no longer; For you mounted your father’s bed."  

Verse 23

NOW THE SONS OF JACOB WERE TWELVE IN NUMBER.  Now, after Binyamin was born [vv. 16-20], and until that whole section was concluded, [Torah] did not want to interrupt [to give this information.]

ESAV AND YA'AKOV.  Because he [Esav] was the b'chor and Ya'akov accorded him deference, the text mentions him first.  However, in the case of Avraham's burial (Gen. 25:9), the text places Yitz'hak before Yishma'el because he [Yishma'el] was the son of the handmaid.

Chapter 36



Verse 1



Verse 2

ESAU TOOK HIS WIVES FROM AMONG THE CANAANITE WOMEN.  The careful reader will see that, in the first section of Parashat Tol'dot, it is said (Gen. 26:34), "Yehudit daughter of Be'eri the Hittite, and Bas'mat daughter of Elon the Hittite,"  (Gen. 28:9), "Mahalat the daughter of Yishmael," but in this section, "the daughter of Be'eri" is not mentioned at all, neither her name nor her father's, but Elon and Yishmael, the father of the first two wives, are mentioned.  Also, the names of the daughters are changed, as we find in several places:  Bas'mat the daughter of Elon is here called "Adah the daughter of Elon," and Mahalat the daughter of Yishmael is here called "Bas'mat."  Thus, one might say that Yehudit daughter of Be'eri died childless, but the daughters of Elon and Yishmael had the children identified here, and he married Oholivama the daughter of Ana the daughter of Tziv'on the Hivite afterwards -- after he went to dwell at Mt. Seir (Gen. 36:8) and he married among the Seirites, the Hivite (Gen. 36:2, but elsewhere Horite), as is written below, for Oholivama was the daughter of Ana the daughter of Tziv'on the son of Seir the Horite (Gen. 36:20-25).  Also [Elifaz married among the Hivites], as it is also written there (Gen. 36;12) that Timna, Elifaz's concubine, was among the Seirites (Gen. 36:21-22).  And because Oholivama was his last wife, in each of these sections it mentions her and her children last.

Verse 6

BECAUSE OF YA'AKOV HIS BROTHER.  Because Ya'akov had purchased the birthright and so had the right to inherit Yitzhak, so he [Ya'akov] settled in the land where his father had sojourned (Gen. 37:1).

Verse 9

THESE ARE THE TOL'DOT [JPS:  THIS IS THE LINE] OF ESAV.  His children's descendants, as I have explained on "These are the tol'dot of Noah" (see Gen. 6:9, 10:1).

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

(1) AND TIMNA WAS THE CONCUBINE.  I saw in Shohar Tov [Midrash T'hillim], that "and Timna" is connected to the previous verse and to this one, for in Chronicles, it says (I Chron. 1:36), "Zephi, Gatam, Kenaz, Timna, and Amalek," and afterwards (vv. 38-39), it says regarding the Seirites, "and Lotan’s sister was Timna."  (This is similar to "the sister of Nevaiot" (Gen. 28:9) and "the sister of Aharon" (Exod. 15:20), as I have explained.)  And similarly here (vv. 11-12): "The sons of Elifaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz, and Timna." 
(2) "And Timna was a concubine."  The first ["and Timna" -- v.11] is male and is among the sons of Elifaz, and the second is female:  "and the sister of Lotan was Timna"  (I Chron. 1:38-39).  Similarly in Joshua (13:7-8), "(7) Therefore, divide this territory into hereditary portions for the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.  (8) With them, the Reubenites and the Gadites took their shares that Moses assigned to them on the east side of the Jordan."  You must admit that something is missing from the second of these verses, as it should have said that the [other] half-tribe of Manasseh had already received their share.  Therefore, one can say that this verse counts with the end of the verse that says "the half-tribe of Manasseh," even though the two verses refer to two [different] half-tribes of Manasseh.  Even though the two verses refer to two [different] half-tribes of Manasseh, to one of which Moshe had allotted and to the other of which Yehoshua had allotted.  And I, Sh'muel, have found a third verse, in Chronicles, of the same sort, regarding the families of Yehonatan son of Sha'ul (I Chron. 8:29-38):  "(35) The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Taarea, and Ahaz. (36) Ahaz begot Jehoaddah; and Jehoaddah begot Alemeth, etc."  And this passage is repeated on another page; the beginning of that section is "There lived in Gibeon," and the end of the section is "These were the sons of Azel" (I Chron. 9:35-44).  And it is written [there] (vv. 41-42), "The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Taharea; and Ahaz begot etc."

Verse 15

All of the chieftains [alufim; JPS: "clans"] in this section are among the officers of cities and clans.  And regarding the "aluf Korah" mentioned in this verse (v.16), it seems to me that he is Timna, who is among the sons of Elifaz mentioned in Chronicles (I Chron. 1:36), for among the sons of Oholivama (Gen. 36:18) there is a different Korah.

Verse 22

LOTAN’S SISTER WAS TIMNA.  Because Lotan was the oldest of her brothers, it calls her his sister.  Similarly (Gen. 28:9), "Nevaiot's sister," and (Exod. 15:20) "Miriam the prophet, Aharon's sister."

Verse 23



Verse 24

(1) AIAH AND ANAH [V'AYAH VA'ANAH].  It seems to me as follows:  that their names [begin with vav] like Vafsi (Num. 13:14) and Vashti (Esth. 1:9).  And even though in Chronicles it is written (I Chron. 1:40), "Aiah and Anah," there is no need to be exacting in the matter, since it is written in the Torah (Gen. 10:23), "Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash," and in Chronicles (I Chron. 1:17), "and Meshech."  And one who explains that the vav is superfluous is surprising -- why would it write an extra vav here more than for the other sons?  And the proofs that they adduce are not valid, as the vavs that they cite are not really extra.  [For example:]  (II Sam. 13:20) "Tamar remained and was forlorn" (VaTeishev Tamar v'shomeimah).  Its meaning is like (Gen. 38:11) "Stay as a widow in your father’s house," because the staying (y'shivah) is synonymous with shomeimah, and it is as if it said, "she remained alone and forlorn."  [For another example:]  (Ps. 76:7), "At Your blast, O God of Ya'akov, horse and chariot lay stunned" (Nirdam v'rechev vasus).  This is its meaning:  "At Your blast, O God of Ya'akov, there lay stunned the army of our enemy that is mentioned above and also its chariot and its horses," as is written (Exod. 15:1), "Horse and its driver (sus v'rochvo) He has hurled into the sea."  
(2) THAT WAS THE ANAH  who was mentioned in the time of Moshe, for his heroism 
(3) WHO DISCOVERED THE HOT SPRINGS, the mighty men or the savage animals, and defeated them.  [This is] according to the plain meaning [and] there is no need to parse further.

THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE CHIEFTAINS OF ESAV BY THEIR CLANS AND LOCATIONS.  With these chieftains, it identifies some of the chieftains mentioned above (vv. 15-31) among the Esavites.  And one should say that these [mentioned here] were, ultimately, the primary ones, the chieftains of each city, as it is written here (v.43), "by their locations [settlements] in the land that they hold."  And the proof of what I say is that all the passages about the Esavites, the Seirites, and the kings who ruled, until the very end of the section, they are written in Chronicles (I Chron. 1:35-54), but the first section about the chieftains of the Esavites (vv. 15-31) is not mentioned there at all, but rather the chieftains of the second section (vv. 40-43) alone.

Chapter 37



Verse 1

YA'AKOV SETTLED.  Esav went "to another land because of his brother Ya'akov" (Gen. 36:6), but Ya'akov settled near his father in the land of his [Yitzhak's] sojournings, because the birthright is his.

Verse 2

(1) THIS, THEN, IS THE LINE OF YA'AKOV. Intelligent people should discern and understand what our Rabbis taught us, that Scripture never forsakes its plain sense. Even though, essentially, Torah comes to teach us and inform us through hints from the plain sense, narratives, laws, and rules, and through elaborations of the text and the 32 principles of R' Eliezer the son of R' Yosi HaG'lili, and through the 13 principles of R' Yishma'el. And the early Sages, because of their piety, engaged in inclining after the drashot, which are primary, and because of this, they were not familiar with the deep plain sense of Scripture. As the Sages said, "Do not make your children engage much in Scripture" [see Ber. 28a and Rashi there]. And they also said (B.M. 33a), "One who occupies himself with Scripture [alone] is meritorious but not very much so, ... but one who engages in Talmud, there is no greater measure than this." And in this way, they were not so familiar with the plain sense of Scriptural passages. And as it says in Mas. Shabbat, "I was 18 years old and had read the entire Talmud, and I did not know that Scripture never forsakes its plain sense." And our Master Shlomo, my maternal grandfather, the enlightener of the Exile, who expounded on Torah, N'vi'im, and K'tuvim, set his mind also on explaining the plain sense of Scripture. However, I, Sh'mu'el the son of R' Meir, his son-in-law, may his sainted name be for a blessing, argued with him and before him, and he acknowledged to me that if he had had more time, he would need to produce other commentaries according to the plain meanings that renew each day. 
And now the intelligent people will see what the early ones explained (2) "THIS IS THE LINE OF YA'AKOV" as "These are the events and the occurrences that happened to Ya'akov." And this is nonsense. For every "eleh tol'dot" in Torah and K'tuvim is either about the individual's children or, more often, his grandchildren, as I explained in [Parashat] "Eleh Tol'dot Noah" (Gen. 6:9). Above that, in Parashat B'reishit, it's written (Fen. 5:32), "Noah was 500 years old, and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Yafet." And after that, it explains that the world sinned, but (Gen. 6:8) "Noah found favor." And after that, it states (Gen. 6:9), "These are the generations of Noah," his children's children -- how he had three sons, and the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered him to bring them into the Ark for 12 months, and upon their exit, "sons were born to them after the Flood" (Gen. 10:1), until they increased to 70 descendants, who were the 70 nations, as it is written (Gen. 10:32), "from these branched out etc."And likewise with Esav. The first section (Gen. 36:1-5) specifies Esav's sons who were born to him in his father's location, and after that "he went to another land" (v.6) and settled on Mt. Seir (v.9) and all that section. And it is written (v.9), "This, then, is the line of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites, in the hill country of Seir." And all of this second section is about Esav's children [their descendants].    And as we found with Esav -- that it states that his sons were born in his father's neighborhood, before he "went to another land because of his brother Jacob" (Gen. 36:6), and his grandchildren were born at Mt. Seir -- so with Ya'akov: above, it says (Gen. 35:22), "Now the sons of Jacob were twelve in number. Etc." And it states at the end (vv. 26-27), "These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram. And [Jacob] came to his father Isaac, etc." Thus it has set out Ya'akov's sons and where they were born, as it id with Esav's sons. And now [in our chapter] it writes (Gen. 37:2), "This is the line of Ya'akov": his grandchildren, who were 70, how they were born. How? "Yosef was 17 years old"; his brothers envied him; and as a result, "Yehuda left his brothers" (Gen. 38:1) and had sons in K'ziv and in Adulam -- Shelah, Peretz, and Zerah; and it ensues that Yosef "was taken down to Egypt" (Gen. 39:1), and Menashe and Ephraim were born to him in Egypt, and Yosef sent for his father and his household, until they numbered 70. And Moshe our Master had to write all this, since he rebuked them in connection with this, "Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy persons in all" (Deut. 10:22; see 11:1).
(3) בן שבע עשרה שנה, this was necessary so that we realise that the separation of Joseph from his father –during which time Yaakov had considered his as dead- lasted for 22 years. The Torah testified in 41,26 that Joseph was 30 years old when presented to Pharaoh, after which time 7 good years and 2 years of famine occurred before Yaakov and family descended to settle in Egypt, making a total of 22 years of separation.
(4) TENDED THE FLOCKS WITH HIS BROTHERS. The sons of Leah. Following social norms, it calls [them] his brothers, and not the sons of the concubines.
(5) והוא נער את בני בלהה ואת בני זלפה, he spent most of his time in the company of those four children who were far closer to him in age. The fact that Joseph preferred the company of the sons of the servant-maids may have been the beginning of the sons of Leah resenting him.
(6) ET EHAV. With his brothers. He herded, but, out of youthful joy, he separated from them and was regularly with the concubines' sons rather than with them, like a youth, as it is written (Hos. 11:1), "Israel was still a child," and it is written (II Sam. 2:14), "Let the young men come forward and sport before us." 
 And it goes on and recounts all sorts of matters that caused them to hate him, also, (7) AND YOSEF BROUGHT BAD REPORTS OF THEM. Bad reports of his brothers. This is like the midrash (Ber. R. 84:7), according to my explanation: That he said to his father as follows: "They are disparaging the sons of the concubines, but I am treating them respectfully, and I am with them regularly." Other p'shat commentators have missed this point.

Verse 3

And Israel loved. . . All this caused the jealousy. 
son of old age -- for he was the last of 11 sons, Binyamin not being born immediately afterward but following much time. Long before Binyamin had been born Yosef had been a son of old age and Ya'akov had begun to love him. ...

מה החלום הזה?, even if Joseph’s mother had still been alive, Yaakov would still have rebuked Joseph for having such a dream.


Verse 11

HIS FATHER KEPT THE MATTER IN MIND.  Why was it necessary to include this?  When the good news came [of Yosef's still being alive, Gen. 45:26-28], and he [Ya'akov] did not believe his sons that he [Yosef] was still alive, and Yisrael saw the wagons that Par'oh had sent -- they were sent only at the behest of the king, as it is written there (45:21), "wagons as Par'oh had commanded" -- then he believed, because of the dreams that demonstrated that he [Yosef] would wind up being a ruler, and these wagons came by means of royalty and authority, and on that basis, he said (45:28), "'Enough! ... My son Joseph is still alive!'"  For it is a major puzzle how he could believe after he saw the garment full of blood, as Yitzhak was trembling with regard to Ya'akov because he found hair on his neck.

COME NOW, LET US KILL HIM.  This is an expression of invitation to other persons.  Likewise (v.27), "Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites."  Likewise (Gen. 38:16), "Here, let me [sleep with you]" [and] (Exod. 1:10), "Let us deal shrewdly."  Likewise (Deut. 11:26), "See, this day I set before you."

Verse 21

HE SAVED HIM FROM THEM.  Such that he was not killed.

Verse 22

(1) CAST HIM INTO THAT PIT OUT IN THE WILDERNESS.  A place where people are not around, so that he will die as a natural result.  
(2) INTENDING TO SAVE HIM.  The verse testifies about Re'uven that his intent was to save him, as the end of the narrative demonstrates [see vv. 29-30].

Verse 23

THE ORNAMENTED TUNIC.  Some say that this is mentioned here only because it was the original cause for the hatred.  This is not the case.  Instead, because it says below (v.32), "They had the ornamented tunic taken [to their father]," to mislead him, so that he would think, mentally, that (v.33) "A savage beast devoured him."  As it says (v.32), "He recognized it, and said, 'My son’s tunic!'"  For that reason, it mentions it here.

Verse 24

THERE WAS NO WATER IN IT.  For if there had been water in it, they would not have thrown him there, since [by doing that] they would have drowned him, and thus killed him actively.  However, they said (v.22) "do not touch him yourselves" and (v.27) "let us not put our hands on him" -- to cause his death.

Verse 28

MIDIANITES PASSED BY.  While they were sitting down to eat a meal, and were somewhat distant from the pit, so as not to "eat over the blood" (Lev. 19:26), and were awaiting the Ishmaelites whom they had seen.  And before the Ishmaelites arrived, other Midianites passed by in the same direction, saw him in the pit, and extracted him, and the Midianites sold him to the Ishmaelites.  And one can say that the brothers did not know, and even though it is written (Gen. 45:4) "whom you sold into Egypt," one can say that the indirect effect of their actions assisted his sale.  This is what seems to me from the deep straightforward meaning of the text, since "Midianites passed by" implies that it was by chance, and they sold him to the Ishmaelites.  And even if you say that "they sold Yosef to the Ishmaelites" that the brothers sold him, you must still say that they instructed the Midianite traders to extract him from the pit, and afterwards they sold him to the Ishmaelites.

Verse 36

THE MEDANITES SOLD HIM TO THE EGYPTIANS [in the verse: TO EGYPT].  Medan and Midian and the Ishmaelites were brothers, and Medan and the Ishmaelites are one and the same, according to the plain meaning.  Thus it says that the Medanites sold him and that the Ishmaelites brought him down (Gen. 37:28, 39:1), because they are the same, according to the plain meaning.

CANAANITE.  According to Targum Onkelos:  a merchant, as in (Isa. 23:8), "whose traders the world honored," and (Hos. 12:8), "a trader who uses false balances," for they did not marry the daughters of the [actual] Canaanites.

(2) PROVIDING OFFSPRING [N'TON ZERA].  [The vowel in "n'ton" is] a hataf-kamatz [our kamatz katan].  For wherever a word has a m'lapom [holam] and is accented on its last syllable, and the next word is accented on its first syllable, the two words are joined with a makaf, and the m'lapom is changed to a hataf-kamatz.  Thus (Ps. 145:8) "ug'dol-hased" and (Exod. 21:11) "im sh'losh-eleh."   However, in "et sh'losh he-arim" (Num. 35:14) [the vowel in "sh'losh"] remains a m'lapom [because the first syllable of the next word is not accented].

(4) AT THE ENTRANCE TO EINAYIM.  At the gate to the crossroads, such that everyone would pass by and be visible to the eyes on that road.  And one who interprets this as the name of a city is mistaken, for, after all, it is written below (v.21), "the one ba'einayim," and if it meant the name of a city, it should have said "b'einayim," with the beit [vocalized with a] hataf [a sh'va], for we do not find that it says "baBeit El," "baY'riho," "baY'rushalayim," with a kamatz.

(2) SHE SHOULD BE BURNT.  According to the plaiu sense, this was their practice, since she was obligated to have a levirate marriage.

Verse 25

SHE WAS BROUGHT OUT.  After they brought her out, she sent the pledge, and she still did not want to reveal [anything] except to the man whose possessions these were.

Verse 26

(1) SHE HAS BEEN RIGHTEOUS THAN I.  More than I.  For I directed her to remain in her father's house until Shelah grew up.  She complied with the condition that I establihed for her to fulfill, but I did not comply with the condition that I established for her, as I did not give her to Shelah my son.  Similarly (Job 32:2), "because he thought himself right than God" -- more than God, and similarly regarding Sha'ul (I Sam. 24:18), "He said to David, 'You are right than I'" -- more than I.  
(2) HE WAS NOT [INTIMATE WITH HER] AGAIN.  He did not add [v'lo hosif -- to what he had already done].  For if you interpret it as "he did not cease" [pasak, understanding "yasaf" as from "sof"], it should have written, "v'lo yasaf od milda'atah" [did not cease from knowing her].

ZERAH.  Because of the [thread of] scarlet [shani], which is red [adom].  Zerah is an expression of redness, as it is written (II Chron. 26:19). "leprosy broke out [zarha] on his forehead."  And similarly, every instance of the shining of the sun in the morning or the evening is red, as it is written (II Kings 3:22), and it was "in the morning, the sun was shining over the water, and from the distance the water appeared to the Moabites as red as blood."  And similarly in Bava Batra, in [the chapter] HaMocher et HaS'finah [84a; note: quotation is inexact], "The sun is dark-red.  The reason why it is not red except at afternoon and evening is because our eyesight is not strong" on account of the strong light of the daytime.

And likewise (Gen. 24:55), "a year or ten months."  And likewise (Ex. 13:10), "at its set time from year to year," referring to Pesah, and saying that it is from one year to the next full year.  But "miketz sh'natayim" without "yamim" would imply at the end of [as little as] one year and a day, as it is written (Lev. 12:6), "in its first year" (ben sh'nato) -- within that year, it calls it "ben sh'nato."

AND PAR'OH AWOKE.  AND HE FELL ASLEEP immediately AND HE DREAMED, ETC.

And at that point, THEN PHARAOH AWOKE, finally, and IT WAS A DREAM!  But until then, he did not know.

HIS SPIRIT WAS AGITATED.  He was mixed up, trespasser in O.F., and he thought to investigate [l'vaker] and to know the answer.  Likewise in Daniel (2:3), "I have had a dream and I am full of anxiety to know what I have dreamed.”  (2) NONE COULD INTERPRET THEM as things satisfactory TO PAR'OH.

Verse 9



Verse 10

Every instance of "Par'oh" means "king" in Egyptian, and so all kings of Egypt are called this.  And [all kings] of the Philistines are called Avimelech, even in the time of David, "when he feigned madness in the presence of Avimelech" (Ps. 34:1).  And [all kings] of Jerusalem are called Malchitzedek:  in Joshua (10:1), "King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem"; and in the time of David (Ps. 110:4), "by My decree" -- I promise that you will be -- "a rightful king [malchi-tzedek]" -- king of Jerusalem.  And [all kings] of Amalek are called Agag:  in the time of Moshe (Num. 24:7), "Their king shall rise above Agag," and in the time of Sha'ul (I Sam. 15:8), "King Agag of Amalek."  Likewise here, "Par'oh" is an expression of kingship, for one does not mention a king's name in front of him, saying "[David] (Par'oh) was angry with his servants"; rather, one would say, "My lord was angry with his servants."  Likewise here (v.44), "I am Par'oh" -- I will be king alone -- (v. 40) "only with respect to the throne shall I be superior to you."  This is why Yosef is called "Avrech" (v.43) -- "father of [avi] the king."  And in the book Lekah Tov, he interprets as I have.

Thus he [the king] called Daniel Beltshatzar, as it is written (Dan. 4:5), "whose name is Beltshatzar, after the name of my god." 
(2) POTIFERA. This is not Potifar, according to the straightforward meaning. ...

Therefore, it specifies here that Ephaim and Menashe were born before the years of famine, before Ya'akov came, but that afterward, he [Yosef] had children and grandchildren, who were recorded instead of their brothers in their inheritance, as Ya'akov said (Gen. 48:6).

WHY DO YOU KEEP LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER?

NAKEDNESS.  Breaches in the walls, and from which place it could easily be conquered.  As it is written (Hab. 3:13), "Raze it from the foundation"; (Ps. 137:7), "Strip her, strip her, to the foundation":  (Isa. 19:7) "the bare places [JPS: papyrus] by the Nile."  And since they were men of stature and all ten were together at all times, and they did not separate from each other like other people who came to buy grain, he said to them, "You are spies."

Verse 12

AND HE SAID TO THEM, “NO, YOU HAVE COME TO SEE THE LAND IN ITS NAKEDNESS!”   For if so [as you claim], how could you not have left one of you with your father [et avichem], in other words, with him [etzlo].  And it was in order to find out whether Binyamin was still alive that he said this to them.  And they responded (v.13), "Your servants were twelve, brothers, etc."  And thus it is written below (Gen. 43:7), "But the man kept asking about us and our family."

Similarly (Gen. 46:34), "For all shepherds are abhorrent to Egyptians" -- they despised shepherds because sheep were contemptible in their eyes, as it is written (Exod. 8:22), "If we sacrifice that which is untouchable to the Egyptians before their very eyes, will they not stone us!"  That which is repulsive to the Egyptians and disgusting, if we sacrifice it before their eyes to our Rock, won't they despise us, stoning us in a shaming way, as we find (II Sam. 15:5-6), "Shim'i ben Geira came out from there, hurling insults as he came.  He threw stones"  He cursed David and stoned with dirt, in a shaming way.


Verse 33

(1) THEY SAT IN FRONT OF HIM.  Yosef had instructed that they be seated this way.  
(2) THEY WERE ASTONISHED.  For they were all born within a seven-year period, and one could not tell which was born before the other.

Verse 34

WAS SEVERAL TIMES [VATEREV].  Like "vatirbeh."  His gift was multiply more [nitravtah].  Similarly (Exod. 39:32), "Thus was completed [vatechel] all the work of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting" -- it was completed.

Verse 4

THEY LEFT THE CITY [YATZ'U ET HA'IR].  As in (Josh. 6:7), "Go forward, march around the city [et ha'ir]."  And similarly (Exod. 9:29), "As I go out of the city [et ha'ir]."  Like (Jer. 10:20), "My children have gone forth from me [yatz'uni]" -- they have gone forth from me [yatz'u mimeni].

(2) TO ALL HIS ATTENDANTS.  In front of all his attendants, and he could no longer control himself.  ...

(1) K'ZOT.  Similarly.  
(2) TEN ASSES.  For his ten brothers.  And even though Binyamin returned with them, he did not want to burden him.  We say in the Talmud (Makk. 11a-b), "A curse by a sage, even if it is conditional, if the condition is fulfilled, the curse comes to pass.  Whence?  From Yehuda, for even though he returned Binyamin to his father, his bones rattled around in the coffin, etc." 

Verse 24

(1)  VAY'SHALAH HIS BROTHERS.  Every expression [from the root sh-l-h] of accompanying uses the hard conjugation [pi'el]; an expression [from the same root] of being sent and returning uses the soft conjugation [kal]. 
(2) DO NOT TIR'G'ZU.  Do not fear anything on the way on account of brigands, for there will be peace on all sides.  And similarly (Ps. 4:5), "So tremble, and sin no more" -- fear the Holy One, blessed be He, and do not sin.  And similarly (Deut. 28:65), "Adonai will give you there an anguished heart" -- "d'hil" [fearing] in the Targum.  And similarly (Hab. 3:7), "Shaken are the pavilions" -- an expression of shaking, as when a person is afraid.  And similarly (Isa. 32:11), "Quake, O confident ones!" [and] (Job 9:6), "Who shakes the earth from its place."  But ragzah in the Targum [i.e., the Aramaic] of Daniel (3:13) and of Ezra (5:12) is an expression of anger.  Trembler is the vernacular for rogez in the 24 books [i.e., the Tanach -- here, the Hebrew portion of the Tanach].


Verse 25



Verse 26

(1) AND THAT HE WAS RULER.  So do not fear to come to him.  
(2) HIS HEART WENT NUMB [VAYAPAG].  His heart stopped, as if to say, "this is not true," for he did not believe them.  As in (Lam. 2:18), "Give yourself no respite," and (Jer. 48:11), "and his bouquet is unspoiled," which is translated "his bouquet did not pag."

Verse 27



Verse 28

ENOUGH with my heart stopping because I did not believe, rather, certainly MY SON YOSEF IS STILL ALIVE.  Other straightforward interpretations they say with cleverness, but they are all empty.  [And I the young one have heard, "Enough, my son Yosef is still alive":  You say Yosef is still alive and that he is a ruler.  It would be enough for me if he is still alive even if he is not a ruler.   I must go and see him before I die.]

(2) ALSO RAISING.  That he was buried in with his ancestors in the Cave of Machpelah.  
(3) HIS HAND SHALL CLOSE YOUR EYES [Lit., "He will rest his hand on your eyes."]  On your matters ("inyaneicha," as opposed to "eineicha") and your needs; he will strive to take care of them, as it is written (Job 9:33), "who will lay his hand on both of us."

(2) THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE LAND OF CANAAN.  But those farther away than Canaan would not come to Egypt, because they were too far away, or perhaps because the famine was not so severe there.

HE SAT ON THE BED.  His feet were down below, on the ground.  That is why it is written below (v.12), "Joseph then removed them [his sons] from his [Ya'akov's] knees."  And this is also to convey Ya'akov's strength, that he spoke all the words of his valedictory seated with his feet on the ground, until he finished all his words, and after that "he drew his feet into the bed " (Gen. 49:33) -- he inserted them into the bed, as in (Deut. 22:2), "you shall bring it [v'asafto] home" and (Judges 19:18) "and nobody has taken me (m'asef oti) indoors."

(1) RA'OH [To see].  Like "r'ot" [seeing].  Similarly (Gen. 50:20), "to bring about [asoh] the present result."  
(2) LO PILALTI [I never expected].  I did not judge in my mind.  Every instance of pilul is an expression of judgment.  Similarly (Ps. 106:30), "Pinhas stood and judged" -- he took vengeance, as it is written (Num. 25:7), "he left the assembly and, taking a spear in his hand, etc." -- an expression of judicial retribution.

Chapter 49



Verse 1

(1) YA'AKOV CALLED.  He sent for them.  
(2) COME TOGETHER.  For the seventy persons had increased during these 17 years and had become a numerous people, and according to the words of our Sages, to (six) hundred thousand.  
(3) WHAT IS TO BEFALL YOU.  With respect to their power and their inheritance.

Verse 2



Verse 3

(1) MY MIGHT AND FIRST FRUIT OF MY VIGOR, EXCEEDING IN RANK AND EXCEEDING IN HONOR.  This is all a single statement; it is the way of Scripture to double its expressions -- "my strength (kohi)" is my power, my wealth, and "my vigor" (oni) is also my wealth, as it is written (Hos. 12:9), "[Ah, I have become rich;] I have gotten power (on)," [and] (Job 20:10), "His own hands must give back his wealth (ono)."  In other words, "you are my first-born and as such my strength and the beginning of my wealth."  
(2) EXCEEDING. Your brothers, you should have been, IN RANK AND EXCEEDING IN STRENGTH. You should have ruled over your brothers, but you had instability and confusion, like waste water, and therefore  YOU SHALL EXCEL NO LONGER.  Neither the birthright nor the monarchy.

Verse 4

(1) FOR WHEN YOU MOUNTED YOUR FATHER’S BED.  And it says in Chronicles (I  5:1-2), "when he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel, so he is not reckoned as first-born in the genealogy.  Though Judah became more powerful than his brothers and a leader came from him, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph."   
(2) MY COUCH HE MOUNTED!  In other words, my couch he would mount.  There are many instances of past tense verbs that are understood as present tense, such as (Gen. 23:13), "I have paid the price of the land" -- I am paying.

Verse 5

(1) THEIR TOOLS.  Their fraternity; this is a duplication of "Shimon and Levi are a pair [lit., "brothers"]."  In other words, Shimon and Levi were "brothers" for ill.  
(2) THEIR WEAPONS their fraternity was.  "Your origin (m'choroteicha) and birth" (Ezek. 16:3) is an expression of relations.  But "m'cheirotehim" is the dageish form [pi'el], like "m'siboteihem" (Job 37:12 -- "misibot"), and is an espression of relationship.  However, the reish, where there is a hiriq, it [the hiriq] becomes a tzeirei, like "beireich" (e.g. Gen. 24:1) instead of "bireich" [like] (Lam. 2:9) "ibeid v'shiber" [destroyed and broke].  Similarly (Ps. 74:18), "blasphemes [heireif] God" [and] (Num. 8:6) "they will assist [v'sheireit] their brothers."  They are all of the dageish form.  "M'cheiroteihem" is "lod [leur?] pareintes" in the vernacular.

Verse 6

(1) LET NOT MY PERSON BE INCLUDED IN THEIR COUNCIL.  May it be Your will that my person not be in their counsel.  For every "al" in the Torah looks to the future -- either a curse, a request, or a command.  There is no "al" about the past; thus, this should not be understood as "my person has not been included."  
(2) KI IN THEIR ANGER.  Because in their anger. 
(3) THEY MAIM OXEN.  As in (Josh. 11:6) "You shall hamstring their horses."

Verse 7

(1) CURSED BE THEIR ANGER.  They will not succeed in their anger to take vengeance and commit bad deeds, and therefore, I do not want to be in their company and together with them.  
(2) I WILL DIVIDE THEM IN JACOB.  For Levi was scattered among the twelve tribes, as is written in Joshua (ch. 21), the result being that Shim'on was left alone without Levi.  

Verse 8

(1) YEHUDAH, YOU YOUR BROTHERS SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE.  One who explains this as "your brothers shall praise you" is mistaken.  Rather, since he had criticized the first ones and taken sovereignty from Re'uven and had scattered Shim'on and Levi, he said to Yehudah, "But you, your brothers shall accord the glory [hod] of sovereignty, as the end of the verse demonstrates: "Your father's sons shall bow low to you."  Likewise (Num. 27:20), "Invest him with some of your authority [hod'cha]" -- give him some of your responsibilities while you are still alive.   Likewise in Daniel (11:21), "on whom royal majesty [hod] was not conferred."  Likewise about Sh'lomo it is written "hod malchut" -- "endowed him with a regal majesty [hod]" in Chronicles (I, 29:25).  
(2) SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE YOU [YODUCHA].  Shall crown you, like "y'hoducha," as it is written (Ps. 45:18), "so peoples will praise you."  Likewise (I Kings 6:27) "Let the LORD help you [yoshiacha]," like "y'hoshiacha."  Nevertheless, even though "yoducha" derives from "hod malchut," the heh is not part of the root, but rather, it is of the form where the first letter of the root drops out, that letter being yod, like yashav, yatza, from which one says "hotzi" [to expel], "hoshiv" [to seat].  Likewise from "yarah bayam" [he has cast into the sea] (Ex. 15:4), [we derive] "horah" -- "vayoru hamorim" [the archers shot] (II Sam. 11:24).  Likewise (Ezek. 18:16) "he has not wronged [honah] anyone" from the root (Lev. 19:33) "you shall not wrong [tonu] him."  Similarly, "hodu LAdonai" [Praise the LORD] (Isa. 12:4) [and] "Yodu LAdonai" [Let them praise the LORD] (Ps. 107:8), [and] "hogah v'rahem" [afflicts and pardons] (Lam. 3:32) -- they are all roots with the first letter being yod that occasionally drops out and a vav comes in its place. 
(3) THEY WILL BOW LOW TO YOU.  For you will rule over tham.  
(4) YOUR FATHER'S SONS.  Because they were from four mothers, it says "your father's sons," but when Yitz'hak blesses Ya'akov, it is written (Gen. 27:29) "your mother's sons."

Verse 9

(1) YEHUDA IS A LION'S WHELP.  Like (Jud. 14:5) "a full-grown lion."  The young one is called "gur," as in (Ezek. 19:2), "Crouching among the great beasts [k'firim], She reared her cubs [gureiha]."  Because he is quicker and mightier than an old lion, it compares Yehuda to a lion's whelp.  (2) FROM PREY, MY SON, YOU HAVE RISEN [JPS: On prey, my son, have you grown].  You, Yehudah my son, after you rise up from preying on the nations, and you then settle down and lie down in your city, no enemy will come to make you tremble and to rouse you up from your place.  This is the plain meaning, and one who interprets it as referring to the sale of Yosef does not know the meaning of the verse or the syntax based on the t'amim at all.

Verse 10

(1) THE SCEPTER SHALL NOT DEPART FROM JUDAH.  The kingship that was given to him, for his 12 brothers to bow down to him.  There will not depart from him the greatness, nor the lawgiving and dominion from his descendants until he -- Yehudah -- comes to Shiloh, in other words, until the king of Judah, R'hav'am son of Sh'lomo, who came to renew the monarchy at Shiloh, which is near Sh'chem, but then the ten tribes will abandon him and crown Y'rov'am, and none will remain with R'hov'am son of Sh'lomo except Judah and Benjamin.  (2)  AND THE HOMAGE OF PEOPLES BE HIS. The group of nations that were subjugated under Sh'lomo his father, as it is written (I Kings 5:4), "he controlled the whole region west of the Euphrates," gathered there to crown R'hav'am, as it is written (see I Kings 12:1, II Chron. 10:1), "R'hav'am went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to acclaim him king."  And Sh'chem is near Shiloh, as it is written in Joshua (24:1), "Yehoshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem" and the whole section, and at the end, it specifies that all of these events were before Adonai at Shiloh.  And also in Judges (21:19), "'The annual feast of the LORD is ... at Shiloh.' ...  [on] the highway that runs from Bethel to Shechem."  Also in Jeremiah (41:5), "men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria."  There was smooth ground in Sh'chem around the oak that was in Sh'chem, which was suitable for people to gather there, and for the glory of the Mishkan, which was in Shiloh nearby.  [And this plain meaning is a refutation of the sectarians, for all that is written here is Shiloh, the name of the city, for there is no foreign term in Scripture, and "shelo" (his) is not written here, as is said by the Hebrews, nor "shaliah" (messenger), as is said by the Christians.]  And Ya'akov spelled out the essential greatness of Yehudah, which was from David to R'hav'am.  But the lack of greatness he did not try to spell out; rather, from the Scripture as a whole you can derive it, for from Shiloh on, it diminished.

Verse 11

(1) HE TETHERS HIS ASS TO A VINE.  An ir, a young ass, must be tethered to a single vine to load it, because of the multitude of grapes.   
(2) TO A single CHOICE VINE.  ...
(3) HIS ASS'S FOALS.  Duplication of expression.  As it is written regarding Sh'lomo (I Kings 4:20, 5:5), "Judah and Israel were numerous ... everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree," for they were surfeited with wine.  ...
(4) HE WASHES HIS GARMENT IN WINE.  After they have harvested the grapes and stomped them in their vats, they would stain their clothes in the stomping of the wine, as it is written (Isa. 63:2), "Why is your clothing so red, Your garments like his who treads grapes?" and it is written there (ibid. v.3), "And all My clothing was stained."  And after the stomping, they drink the wine.  And thus, it it says (v.12), "His eyes are darker than wine," as it is written (Prov. 23:29-30), "Who has bleary eyes? Those whom wine keeps till the small hours."  ...
(5) HIS ROBE.  A term for a garment.

Verse 12

(1) DARKNESS.  Redness of eyes is so called.  
(2) WHITENESS OF TEETH IS FROM [JPS:  His teeth are whiter than] drinking MILK.  As it is written (Song 4:1), "I have drunk my wine and my milk," and similarly (Isa. 55:1), "Wine and milk without cost."  ...
(3) UL'VEN (WHITENESS).  Like "lavan" (white).  When it is in the construct case, one says "ul'ven," as from "halav" (milk), we get (Deut. 32:14) "vahalev tzon" ("milk of flocks"). 

Verse 13

(1) BY THE SEASHORE [L'HOF YAMIM].  The sea coast, because the sea rubs up there against [hofef] there and scratches [the land].  And if you ask how this benefits Z'vulun:  since the coast [in many places] is elevated, and one can't descend to engage in commerce, it therefore explains that-- 
(2) HE SHALL BE A HAVEN FOR SHIPS at this port location, where the coast is low, the ships come, and the local residents come and buy the merchandise on the ships.  
(3) ON SIDON.  For it was a major commercial site, as it is written in Isaiah (23:2), "traders of Sidon and seafarers thronged" and it is written (Isa. 23:4), "Be ashamed, O Sidon!  For the sea—this stronghold of the sea."  And thus Moshe says (Deut. 33:18), "Rejoice, O Zebulun, on your journeys" on the sea for commerce.

Verse 14

(1) YISSACHAR IS A STRONG-BONED ASS.  Unlike Z'vulun, who goes with the seafarers for trade, but rather he [Yissachar] will be a worker of the land, like the ass, having strong limbs, found -- 
(2) AMONG THE SHEEPFOLDS.  The precincts of the city, to plow and work the land, as it is written (Isa. 32:20), "by all waters, Who send out cattle and donkeys" to plow and plant," and Moshe says similarly (Deut. 33:18), "Rejoice, O Zebulun, on your journeys, and Yissachar in your tents."

Verse 15

(1) WHEN HE [YISSACHAR] SAW.  The SECURITY of the land.  
(2) THAT IT WAS GOOD.  Better than to venture out to great distances.  
(3) AND HOW PLEASANT WAS THE COUNTRY, as it is written (Deut. 12:9), "the allotted haven."   
(4)  HE BENT HIS SHOULDER TO THE BURDEN of the yoke of the kings of Israel. 
(5) AND BECAME A TOILING SERF.  To give a tithe of his harvests to the kings, as it is written (I Sam 8:14), "He will take a tenth part of your fields."  This is the essential straightforward meaning, and it is a message of wealth to the tribe of Yissachar."

Verse 16


(1) DAN SHALL GOVERN HIS PEOPLE.  One who interprets this as about Shimshon does not know the depths of the plain sense of Scripture at all.  Did Ya'akov really come to prophesy about a man who fell to the Philistines, and whose eyes they put out, and who died with the Philistines, in an unfortunate matter?  Heaven absolutely forbid!  He prophesied specifically for the tribe of Dan, which was the after-guard for all the tribes.  And in Joshua (6:9) it is written, "and the rear guard marched behind the Ark."  And because they went, throughout Moshe's and Yehoshua's times, after the other divisions, and they had to combat all the nations that pursued them to cut down all the stragglers in their rear on the road [see Deut. 25:18], and to take vengeance against the nations, because they were mighty.  That is why Ya'akov said "Dan will effect justice for [yadin] his people -- he will take vengeance for his people.  ...
(2) AS ONE.  All.  ...
(3) THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL.  He will take vengeance for them and protect them from pursuers, as in (Deut. 32:36), "Adonai will vindicate [yadin] His people, etc." and (Deut. 32:43), "For He’ll avenge the blood of His servants, Wreak vengeance on His foes," and as in (Ps. 110:6), "He works judgment upon [yadin] the nations, heaping up bodies, crushing heads far and wide."


Verse 17

(1) LET the tribe of --
(2) DAN BE A SERPENT BY THE ROAD to kill other nations.  
(3) SO THAT ITS RIDER IS THROWN.  The enemies will fall before him.

Verse 18

(1) YOUR DELIVERANCE.  [Your, i.e.,] Dan.  
(2) I AWAIT, ADONAI.  That He should save you and elevate you above the nations.

Verse 19

GAD, THE TROOPS [GAD G'DUD].  The troops of Israel will troop after him when they go to Yehoshua's war, as it is written (Deut. 3:18), "You must go as shock-troops at the head of your Israelite kin."  And when Gad returned from the war, those of Gad will return after those of Israel, for this is the practice -- when going out to war, they go out first, and on their return, they are last, to protect the tribes from war, lest the enemy pursue them.

Verse 20

(1) ASHER’S BREAD SHALL BE RICH (LIT.: FROM ASHER, HIS BREAD WILL BE FAT).  Because they would bring olive oil from Asher to fry their food.  Moshe said similarly (Deut. 33:24), "Most blessed of sons be Asher"; let Israel bless him: "May he be the favorite of" theirs because "he dips his foot in oil."  
(2) HE SHALL YIELD ROYAL DAINTIES.  The kings of Israel would collect a tax on oil to anoint, to make their flesh tender, as we see in M'nahot (86a): R' Judah says. Anfakinon is the oil of olives not a third grown. And why is it used for smearing? Because it removes the hair and softens [m'aden] the skin."  As in (Gen. 18:12), "am I to have enjoyment [ednah]" -- smooth skin. 

Verse 21

(1) A HIND SET LOOSE.  Mighty men as swift as hinds, as it is written (I Chron. 12:9), "[soldiers] as swift as gazelles upon the mountains."  
(2) WHICH YIELDS LOVELY FAWNS [IMREI SHEFER].  When they return from battle, they are prompt, because of their speed, to bring favorable [m'shuparot] reports of victory in war, and as it is written (Jud. 5:18), "Zebulun is a people that mocked at death; Naphtali—on the open heights," like the deer, which run on the heights of mountains.

Verse 22

(1) JOSEPH IS A WILD ASS, A WILD ASS BY A SPRING [BEN PORAT YOSEF; BEN PORAT ALEI AYIN]. This verse is an example of halves at the beginning of the verse [where the first half does not complete the thought] but tells who is being discussed, and the verse then repeats the beginning and completes the thought.  Similarly: "The ocean sounds, O LORD, the ocean sounds its thunder" (Ps. 93:3); "Surely, Your enemies, O LORD, surely, Your enemies perish" (Ps. 92:10); "How long shall the wicked, O LORD, how long shall the wicked exult" (Ps. 94:3); "Utter futility!—said Koheletn/ Utter futility! All is futile!" (Eccles. 1:2); and " Your right hand, Adonai, glorious in power, Your right hand, Adonai, shatters the foe!" (Exod. 15:6).  
(2) So here, BEN PORAT YOSEF: "A son who is fruitful and grows is Yosef." And over what does he grow?  
(3)  BEN PORAT ALEI AYIN.  HE IS FRUITFUL OVER THE EYE.  He grows and increases above the eye, [so that one needs] to look above eye level, [to see] his stature and his beauty. COLTS [BANOT; GIRLS] of Egypt. 
(4) WILD [TZA'ADAH; WALKS].  Each of them.  
(5) ON A HILLSIDE. [ALEI SHOR]. An expression of seeing, a parallel construction with "alei ayin," as in (Num. 23:9) "[I see them from the mountain tops;] gaze on them from the heights," for the Egyptian girls would march and walk to see him, as did Potiphar's wife and her friends, and as a result --

Verse 23

(1) THEY BITTERLY ASSAILED HIM AND SHOT AT HIM.  Because Potiphar's wife set her eyes on him, they threw him in jail.  ...
(2) AND SHOT AT HIM [VAROBU].  This is a parallel construction with "arrows" in this verse, as in (Job 16:13), "His bowmen [rabav] surrounded me" -- his arrows.  That is why it [the bet in "rabav"] has a dagesh.  However, from the root "m'rivah" [strife], one would say "the Israelites quarreled [ravu] with Adonai,"  as from "kam" [we get] "kamu," from "shav" we get "shavu."  Similarly, from (Jud. 11:25) "Did he start a quarrel [harov rav] with Israel," we would say "ravu."  The verse analogizes Potiphar's defamation to arrows, as it is written (Jer. 9:7), "Their tongue is a sharpened arrow,/ They use their mouths to deceive" [and] (Jer. 9:2), "They bend their tongues like bows for a lie." ...
(3) AND SHOT AT HIM [VAROBU]. From the root R-B-B, as "sobu" [they surrounded] is from S-B-B, and "Shout and be joyous" [varoni] (Isa. 12:6) is from R-N-N.  
(4) AND SHOT AT HIM [VAROBU].  _____ in the vernacular.

Verse 24

(1) YET HIS BOW STAYED TAUT.  The strong bow, which is called alabatra. They place it on a durable and strong wood frame, which is called furka, and one who draws that bow, if he is a very strong person, pulls the cord of the bow with his arms, and his arms bend towards his body, and the arrow travels a great distance. And if he is weak, he cannot pull the cord. And this is the meaning of the verses: Egyptians shot arrows at him and put him in jail, and (Ps. 105:18) "subjected his feet to fetters."  But he emerged and ruled over them, for his bow was stronger and more durable than theirs, and he bound them, as it is written.(Ps. 105:22), "to discipline his princes at will."  ...
(2) AND HIS ARMS WERE MADE FIRM.  His arms bent in his pulling the cord of the bow, and he shot his arrows at them, for he was a strong person, in order to pull the firm part of the bow, which is called furka. And we find instances of mentioning the arm in connection with the pulling of the bow, as it is written (Ps. 18:25), "my arms can bend a bow of bronze," this being an expression of aiming the bow, and similarly (Ps. 38:3), "For Your arrows have struck me; Your blows have fallen upon me.  
(3) WERE MADE FIRM.  They were bent, as in (II Sam. 6:16), "David leaping and whirling."  Pizuz (JPS: leaping) is with the hands, and kirkur (JPS: whirling) is with the legs.  "They were bent" (vayipozu) is from P-Z-Z, as "yisobu" is from S-B-B.  
(4) BY THE HANDS OF THE MIGHTY ONE OF YA'AKOV.  The victory and the dominion come from the Holy One, blessed be He.  
(5) THE MIGHTY ONE OF YA'AKOV. A parallel phrase to --  ...
(6) "THE SHEPHERD, THE ROCK OF ISRAEL"  Similarly (I Sam. 21:8) "Saul's chief herdsman" (abir haro'im).  And also, shepherds are called "abirim," because the cattle and oxen are called "abirim," as it is written (Ps. 68:31), "the company of bulls [abirim] with the calves of the peoples," and similarly (Ps. 22:13), "Many bulls [parim] surround me, mighty ones [abirei] of Bashan encircle me."  ...
(7) BY THE HANDS OF THE MIGHTY ONE OF YA'AKOV.  "Who caused all of this for you [Yosef]?  The Holy One, blessed be He, Who is the mighty One of Ya'akov, God Who has been my [Ya'akov's] shepherd [...] to this day. (Gen. 48:15).  It was by means of your [Yosef's] importance that He sustained me in Egypt."  
(8)  THERE the Holy One, blessed be He, caused [you, Yosef] to be -- 
(9) THE SHEPHERD OF EVEN YISRAEL.  The family of Israel, for Yosef provided for his father and his brothers.  "Even" [stone] is an expression of "father" [av] and family.  The nun [in "even"] is an added  letter, like the nun of "shiga'on v'ivaron" [madness and blindness] (Deut. 28:28), and the mem of "reikam" [empty-handed] (Gen. 31:42) and the mem of "and the vermin [lice] came"  (Ex. 8:13).


Verse 25

(1) FROM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER  all this comes AND HE WILL HELP YOU.   
(2) BLESSINGS OF THE DEEP.  For the deep will rise and will water the land.  
(3) BLESSINGS OF THE BREAST.  That the breasts will not dry up, and the children die from lack of milk.  
(4) AND WOMB.  And even that the fetuses will not die in the womb.  And in the context of cursing, these are written in the opposite order (Hos. 9:14):  "Give them a womb that miscarries" and even when they grow up, let "the breasts shrivel."  [The formula of] "not this and not even that."

Verse 26

(1) THE BLESSINGS OF YOUR FATHER SURPASS THE BLESSINGS OF MY ANCESTORS [HORAI]. The blessings with which the Holy One, blessed be He, blessed me, Ya'akov, your father, as it is written (Gen. 28:13 ff.), "And standing beside him [Ya'akov] was Adonai, etc.," "surpass the blessings of" the mountains [harim], as it is written there (28:14), "You shall spread out to the west and to the east, etc.," a good property without constraints, exalted over the eternal mountains.  
(2) TO THE UTMOST BOUNDS [AD TA'AVAT].  To the end --
(3) -- of THE ETERNAL HILLS.  An expression of "v'hit'avitem" [you shall draw a line] (Num. 34:10), " [draw a line] to L'vo-Hamat" (Num. 34:8).  The blessings of Moshe provide proof regarding this verse, that "horai" is an expression in  parallel with "giv'ot olam" [everlasting hills], as it is written there (Deut. 33:15), "With the best from the ancient mountains [har'rei kedem], And the bounty of hills immemorial [giv'ot olam]."  And those blessings [in Deut. 33:15] will be "ON THE HEAD OF YOSEF" (our verse).  
(4) THE ELECT OF HIS BROTHERS.  King over his brothers.

Verse 27

(1) BINYAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF.  This is about Sha'ul, the first king.  [Ya'akov] prophesied that he would spread out to the peoples all around, and it is written there (I Sam. 14:47), "wherever he turned he worsted [them]," for he wrought violence on all of the peoples.  And Binyamin was also aligned with the righteous kings of Yehuda, who prevailed over all of the peoples, as it is written regarding Asa [II Chron. 14:7], Yehoshafat [II Chron. 17:17], and Yehezkiyahu.  
(2) AND IN THE EVENING HE DIVIDES THE SPOIL.  This is the wolf's practice:  (Jer. 5:6), "The wolf in the evenings ravages them," and (Zeph. 3:3), "wolves of the evening, They leave no bone until morning.."

Verse 28

APPROPRIATE TO HIM.  That which would happen to him in the future, as was said above (Gen. 49:1), "what will befall you in the days to come."
