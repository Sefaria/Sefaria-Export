Rashbam on Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

בראשית ברא אלוקים, let the “intellectuals” realize that all the words of our sages and their interpretations are true and accurate. This is what the Talmud (Shabbat 63) had in mind when it quoted Rav Kahane saying that he had studied the Talmud until the age of 18 and had not yet appreciated that although the laws of the Torah are derived from the text, none of the interpretations are such that they can uproot the plain meaning of the text. They are based on anomalies in the text, not on the text itself wherever the law derived from the Torah appears to conflict with the plain meaning of the text. One example is Genesis 2,4 where the word בהבראם, a most unusual construction, used by the sages to declare that the world was created “for the sake of, or with the help of אברהם,” (Bereshit Rabbah 12,9) seeing that the letters in that word are the same as the ones in the name אברהם, [though in a different sequence. Ed.]<br> I shall list the explanations of earlier commentators of old, in order to demonstrate why I did not follow in their footsteps. Some scholars understand the first verse to mean that “at the beginning G’d created heaven and earth.” This is an erroneous explanation, seeing that water preceded the creation of heaven and earth as we know from verse 2 where “the spirit of G’d” is described as already “hovering over the surface of the water.” Moreover, the Torah did not write בראשונה, which would have been appropriate if it had wanted to tell us that heaven and earth preceded all other phenomena in the universe. The word בראשית is in a construct mode, as in Genesis 10,10 ותהי ראשית ממלכתו בבל “the mainstay of his kingdom was Babylon.” A construct mode like this cannot describe the commencement of something but refers to something already in existence. As to the scholars who understand the word as equivalent to the word תחלה in Hoseah 1,2 i.e. so that it would mean “at the beginning G’d created the heaven,” i.e. before He created heaven and earth there was chaos, darkness on the face of the water, etc., so that it emerges that water had been created first, this too is nonsense. How could the Torah refer to a state of the earth prior to creation of the heaven?<br> The plain meaning of the text is, as occurs many times, that something may be mentioned first in one instance although elsewhere this same phenomenon is mentioned as having occurred at a later stage. In Genesis 9,18 we are told about the three sons of Noach who left the ark after the deluge being Shem, Cham and Yephet, and the Torah adds that Cham was the father of Canaan. Although the information about Canaan is quite out of place at this juncture, the fact that later on the Torah tells us that Noach cursed Canaan, makes it necessary to mention him here, as otherwise we would not have known who this Canaan was whom Noachh cursed in verse 25 of the same chapter. We have a similar situation in Genesis 35,22 where, although Reuven’s conduct with Yaakov’s concubine Bilhah is mentioned, Yaakov’s reaction is not mentioned until shortly before his death when he explains why Reuven had not been viewed by him as suitable to occupy the position normally accorded to a firstborn (Genesis 49,3-4). In 35,22 the Torah already tells us that Yaakov had heard about what Reuven had done. Had the Torah not done so, the reader would have been taken aback at Yaakov’s remonstrating with Reuven at this late stage.<br> There are many such examples. Our entire paragraph here was written by Moses in order for us to understand what is written in the Ten Commandments concerning the reason why the Sabbath is holy, i.e. that it is a symbol reminding us of the fact that G’d created the universe in 6 days and rested on the seventh day. (Exodus 20,10) If anyone were to think that the universe as such had already existed then in the format that we see it now, the Torah corrects such thinking by continuing with

Verse 2

והארץ היתה, the earth had preceded and existed in a chaotic form, as elaborated on by the prophet Jeremiah (Jeremiah 4,23) והנה ראיתי את הארץ והנה תהו ובוהו ואל השמים ואין אורם...ראיתי ואין אדם  מעוף השמים ועד בהמה נדדו הלכו (Jeremiah 9,9) 
This verse explains the meaning of “Tohu vavohu” in greater detail, i.e. that there was no kind of life on earth at that stage.
וחושך על פני תהום, this is a reference to the absence of light in the heaven.
ורוח אלוקים מרחפת (מנשבת) על פני המים, we had to be told that G’d’s wind was active at that stage, else verse 9 of this chapter in which G’d issues a directive for the waters to collect in a contiguous area would not make sense, as we could not have understood how the waters were made to assemble all in one area of the globe. We find the role of this רוח of G’d in Exodus 14,21 when it prepared the manifestation of the sea splitting to allow the Israelites to cross it safely and on dry land.

Verse 3

ויאמר אלוקים יהי אור, by means of this directive G’d meant to correct the fact that up until then everything was in complete darkness,

Verse 4

וירא אלוקים את האור, He looked at its appearance and it was good. The statement is similar to Yocheved saying ותרא אותו כי טוב, (Exodus 2,2) although he had been born three months prematurely, just as had Samuel. In practice, the fact that all his vital features including the nails of his toes and fingers and the hairs on his head had grown, gave her the feeling that he was “good,” i.e. a viable human being, so that she proceeded to hide him for three months because she knew that he was not premature in the sense of not being viable.
ויבדל אלוקים בין האור ובין החושך, He arranged for the day to be divided into 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night. The day commences with a period of light and concludes with a period of darkness. The reason is that the beginning of directives issued during the creative process commenced with the command: “let there be light.”

Verse 5

ויקרא אלוקים ליום אור, you may ask yourself what possible need there was for G’d to call this light “day” already at the time He created it; however this is the way Moses worded it when he wrote down the Torah. Whenever, in Scriptures, G’d is recorded as mentioning “day” and “night,” as for instance in Genesis 8,22, where He made the promise that “henceforth the alternating manifestations of day and night will not cease to occur regularly,” יום ולילה לא ישבותון, this is a reference to the original light created on the first day. G’d always called this “light” “night and day.” Similarly, every time in this chapter when we encounter the expression ויקרא אלוקים, as well as when we read in Numbers 13,15 ויקרא אלוקים להושע בן נון יהושע, whereas the same man as representative of the tribe of Ephrayim had been referred to as הושע only 7 verses earlier as הושע. This was the same man, who, previously, when he appeared in his position of Moses’ personal valet was already known as יהושע, (Exodus 24,13) It is customary among kings that when they appoint a person to a position of eminence to signal this by changing the name of such a person. One well known example of this is Pharaoh calling Joseph צפנת פנח upon appointing him as viceroy of Egypt (Genesis 41,45) Other such examples are found in Daniel 1,7, etc.
ולחשך קרא לילה, “whereas He had already named the darkness ‘night.’” Seeing that mention of light always precedes mention of darkness, the Torah first told us of the name G’d gave to “light.”
ויהי ערב ויהי בקר. It is noteworthy that the Torah here did not write ויהי לילה, ויהי יום, but it wrote ערב. This is the period when G’d made the light of the first day fade. The subsequent expression ויהי בקר refers to the morning after the night when dawn rose. At this point the first of the 6 “days” of G’d’s creative activity of which He spoke in the Ten Commandments had come to an end. After that the second “day” began and is introduced with the words ויאמר אלוקים יהי רקיע בתוך המים. The purpose of our verse here was not to tell us that that evening and morning were part of the same day. The verse was needed only to tell us how the 6 “days” are accounted for, i.e. that the morning completed the night, which was the end of that day and the beginning of the second day.

Verse 6

ויאמר אלוקים יהי רקיע, after the first day had been concluded with its morning, G’d issued a new directive.
רקיע, the word (noun) is a participle describing a creature such as עשיר which means the same as מעושר, “someone who has been equipped with wealth,” or the word חסיד, used to describe a pious individual. This noun is also a derivative from the word חסד, loving kindness, i.e. a חסיד is a creature equipped with this attribute of loving G’d. Now the universe was to be equipped with a horizon. Seeing that from the earth until the highest regions of the heaven there was an unbroken region filled with water, G’d now separated these waters in the “middle,” by making this firmament, expanse of atmosphere we call horizon. This רקיע appears as if stretched from east to west and from north to south effectively separating the “upper” layers of water from the “lower” ones. Seeing that G’d did not assign any specific function to the waters until the third “day” when He told the waters to congregate in a specific region so that the dry land beneath it should become visible, the expression “it was good,” is not mentioned in connection with the second day. This is compensated for on the third “day,” when this statement “it was good” appears twice in the Torah’s report. It appears after the waters complied with G’d’s directive, and after the earth, i.e. the dry land, produced the vegetation including fruit-bearing trees which G’d had commanded it to produce.
בין מים למים, so that half the waters would remain in the “upper” regions and half in the “lower” regions.


Verse 7



Verse 8

ויקרא אלוקים לרקיע שמים, as I have already explained previously, the rakia is referred to as shamayim throughout the Torah, whereas the celestial regions in the spiritual sense are called shm’ey hashamyim, “the upper heavens.” Compare Nechemyah 9,6 where we are told:אתה עשית את השמים, שמי השמים וכל צבאם, “it is You Who have made the sky, the heavens and all their hosts.” In Deuteronomy 10,14 Moses wrote: והן לה' אלוקיך שמים ושמי השמים, “both the skies and the heavens are Yours, O Lord.” 
ויהי ערב ויהי בקר יום שני, the day faded towards evening until the second morning appeared. Thereby the second of the six days of G’d’s creative activity had come to a close. With this morning the third “day” commenced.


Verse 9

ויאמר אלוקים יקוו המים... אל מקום אחד, we already explained on verse 2 that the means employed to achieve this was the ruach, the wind. This is the reason why we were told already in verse 2 that “G’d’s wind (spirit) hovered over the expanse of the deep, something which occurred by making the rakia. (between heaven and earth) Now the water above the earth were concentrated in one region, location. 
ותראה היבשה, a reference to the earth which had already been created at the same time as the heaven, before the light had been created, as I explained on verse 2.. It does not matter whether this occurred spread over a short period or over a long period.


Verse 10

ליבשה ארץ, as I explained earlier, the “yabashah” is none other than the earth mentioned in verse 1 as הארץ, as well as in many other places.

Verse 11

דשא, every kind of herb collectively is known as דשא whereas every individual type of herb is known as עשב.
עושה פרי למינו, according to the plain meaning of the text the word למינו here refers to the herbs. When the word occurs again in connection with the trees, it includes the עשב which the text had defined as carrying within it its own seed.
עושה פרי למינו, an apple tree would produce apples, not dates. 
אשר זרעו בו, the seed would be within the fruit, not within the trunk. This would enable man to plant this kind of tree as well as others, each of their respective species. 


Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

יהי מארות, “let there be luminaries;” it is common for the Torah to apply a singular mode to nouns described in the plural, such as in Numbers 9,6 ויהי אנשים אשר היו טמאים, “there was (singular) men who were ritually impure, etc." The meaning of our verse here is: “let a certain process occur as a result of which luminaries will materialise in the sky of the heavens.”
ברקיע השמים, in the firmament which spans the heavens.
ברקיע, seeing that the word ברקיע is in the construct mode, linked to the word following it, i.e. “the sky of the heaven, the ra-kia, the vowel under the letter ר is a brief one, chataf, such as the difference between katzir, harvest, and k’tzir chittim, “wheat harvest,” where the word k’tzir is in the construct mode, belonging to the word chittim, wheat. (Ruth 2,23) להבדיל בין היום ובין הלילה, the Torah had already mentioned earlier (verse 4) that G’d had made a separation between light and dark, so what need was there for the luminaries in order to accomplish this? The fact is that up until this point the precise point when night or day commences and ends had not yet been defined. This came about only when the sunrise and sunset became visible observable phenomena on earth. Similarly, the advent of visible stars in the sky now signaled that dusk had come to an end. להבדיל בין (תחלת) היום ובין (תחלת) הלילה, to separate night from the beginning of the day and day from the beginning of the night.
והיו לאותות ולמועדים, an oblique reference to Kings II 20,8-9 where King Chizkiyah had asked G’d for a sign in the sky that Isaiah’s promise that the decree of his death had been cancelled and that G’d had added another 15 years to his life was definitive. We have other verses (Yoel 3,3) as well as Jeremiah 10,2 in which these phenomena in the sky are described as clear signals by G’d to man of things to come.
ולמועדים, the orbit of the moon which renews its path every 29 and a half days serves as a legal instrument used in determining dates which appear in documents used by the Jewish people. Compare what David wrote about this in Psalms 104,19
ולימים, and as days. Upon investigation it will be seen that certain stars orbit at intervals of exactly 24 hours.
ושנים, and as years, a reference to the four seasons of the year, which together comprise an entire year.


Verse 15

והיו למאורות, they should provide light for the physical universe.

Verse 16

הקטן, the smaller of the two.

Verse 17



Verse 18

ולהבדיל בין האור ובין החושך, between the period when light begins and the period when darkness begins. Sunrise is the period when light begins, whereas the clear visibility of the stars in the evening is the period when the darkness begins.

Verse 19



Verse 20

יעופף על הארץ, even though its creation originated from the waters, it would grow to maturity on earth.

Verse 21

התנינים הגדולים, even though, in the previous verse, the Torah reports on the directive for the waters to produce multiple reproductions of each species which has its habitat in the waters, and we could have thought that this did not include gigantic creatures such as whales, the fact is they (it) too had been produced by the waters at the same time. The species described as Leviathan, Nachash beriach and Leviathan beriach in Isaiah 27,1 and the Leviathan described in Job 40,25 are what our verse here refers to.

Verse 22

ויברך אותם אלוקים, you will note that all the categories of living creatures whom G’d created were blessed by Him.
ומלאו את המים, this is in the imperative mode, but in a relatively weak conjugation such as אמרו לאלוקים in Psalms 663, or in Hoseah 2,5 רדפו מהר. If the Torah had written mal-u instead mil-u this would have been an imperative in the strong conjugation, comparable to G’d commanding Moses and Aaron with the words dabb-ru (Exodus 12,3.)
ירב. The word means “may it increase in numbers,” an alternate way of saying yirbeh. We have a similar construction in yifen and yifneh respectively, meaning: “he will turn.” Any verb that can accept the letter ה at the end, may appear both with or without that letter.


Verse 23



Verse 24

וחיתו ארץ, the construction is similar to Psalms 104,8 למעינו מים, or to Numbers 24,3 בנו בעור, the letter ו at the end of the word וחיתו is an addition.
ויהי כן, the result of G’d’s directive continued in force for all times.


Verse 25



Verse 26

ויאמר, G’d addressed His angels.
נעשה אדם, these words have to be understood as in Kings I 22,19-22. In these verses the prophet Jeremiah depicts a conversation in the celestial regions between G’d and His angels and they discuss how to trap Achav through a deliberately false message by the false prophet Michayu, into bringing about his own destruction as retribution for his judicial murder of Navot the Yezreelite. We find similar references to G’d “consulting” in Isaiah 6,8 as well as in Job 1,6 where G’d is described as giving Satan leeway in his treatment of Job בצלמנו, in the image of the angels. [It could not refer to G’d seeing that no one had ever seen something that could be described as an “image” of G’d, the totally spiritual Being. Ed.]
כדמותנו, similar to us (angels) in our intellectual faculties. This is borne out by the fact that when man’s spiritual decline is described in Psalms 49,3 his intelligence at that time is compared to a בהמה, a domesticated mammal.
וירדו, the root of the word is רדה to exercise authority, dominion. The construction is similar to that of ויבכו, derived from בכה, and ויעש, derived from עשה, the last root letter being dropped in all of these examples.


Verse 27

בצלמו, in the image of man. בצלם אלוקים, in the image of angels. Do not be surprised if the creation of the angels has not been referred to in detail in the whole report of creation. Moses did not set himself the task of describing either the details of the heavens or hell, and their creation. Neither did he indulge in describing what is known as מעשה מרכבה, the structure of G’d’s entourage, some of which has been transmitted to us by the prophets Ezekiel and Isaiah, respectively. All that is included in the report of creation that Moses recorded here is the visible universe, that which is subject to perception by our senses, as we explained on verse 1.
זכר ונקבה ברא אותם, as the Torah will proceed to explain in detail in chapter 2,21 “He took one of Adam’s sides and fashioned Chavah from it.” We are simply faced here with the report of a generalisation first, followed by greater detail This is also what is described as one of the 32 methods by which Torah can be explained in the treatise of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yossi hagalili, who explained this verse in this fashion.


Verse 28

וכבשוה, the letter כ is “weak,” (without the dot inside) as in Numbers 32,29 ונכבשה הארץ לפניכם, “and the land will have been conquered before you.” The reason why there is no such dot is because it is in the imperative mode. On the other hand, if the letter כ here would have had the dagesh,” the construction of the verb would have been in the past tense, not an imperative.

Verse 29

הנה נתתי לכם, “I am now giving you.” This is an example of a past construction really meaning the present tense. We find examples of this in Genesis 14,22 when Avraham says הרימותי ידי, literally “I have raised my hand,” but meaning: “I am raising my hand, swearing an oath.. We find another example of this in Genesis 23,13 where Avraham refers to the payment to Efron for the cave of Machpelah, saying נתתי כסף השדה, literally “I have given the money for the field.” This could not be a past tense, as he had not known the price charged until this very moment. 

Verse 30

ולכל חית הארץ, however, meat would not be permitted as food for man until Noach, when G’d specifically told him (Genesis 9,2) that meat henceforth would serve him as food just as up until then when G’d had allocated a vegetarian diet for man.

Verse 31


וירא אלוקים את כל אשר עשה והנה טוב מאד, G’d reviewed all that He had done during these six “days,” to see if anything needed adjustments or improvement, but He found that everything was very good. 
“and G-d saw everything that He had made and behold, it was very good” – He looked carefully at all of His work and all of His actions which He had done [to see] if there was anything in them which needed perfecting, and behold, all were beautiful and perfected.

Verse 3

ויברך אלוקים את יום השביעי , when the seventh day arrived, G’d had already created and placed in position all the needs of His creatures, including their food supply, so that it turned out that the Sabbath day was blessed with everything good. (compare author’s comment on Exodus 20,10) [I assume that this comment is based on the fact that if G’d had not created anything on that day, and especially, seeing the comment is written completely out of context, it must have referred to something which had occurred previously. Ed.]

זה ינחמנו, if you were to question why our sages do not describe Lemech as a great prophet, as they described  Ever who had called his son Peleg, foreseeing that in his time mankind would be divided into 70 languages, etc., (Seder Olam 1) the reason is that Noach was the first man born after the death of Adam, and by calling him Noach he merely expressed the hope and prayer that Noach would be able to atone for the iniquity which Adam had perpetrated. The word נח is an allusion to הנחה, a relief, reduction in cost, i.e. the curse that mankind suffers under, especially the earth, should be lifted now that Adam had been replaced by an innocent human being who did not share time on earth with Adam who had brought a curse upon mankind. In the case of Peleg, it is impossible to see in that name the expression of a prayer, a plea; hence we must interpret it as a sign of his father’s prophetic vision.

Verse 30



Verse 31

ויהי כל ימי למך, why did the Torah bother to provide us with the number of years these wicked people lived on earth? This listing of historical data is also the custom of the prophets, one after another [when they listed the years wicked kings reigned over Israel or Yehudah. Ed.] Their purpose in doing so was to tell us how many years had elapsed since the creation of Adam, the first human being until the time when the events recorded by the prophets occurred. When we add up the numbers provided by the Torah both here, and in the chapters after the deluge, we have a continuous historical record of the history of mankind, and more especially, that of the Jewish people. The prophets spell out specifically the number of years that had elapsed between the Exodus from Egypt and the building of the Temple by Solomon, the high point of Jewish history. Daniel augments the record by providing information about how many years elapsed between the destruction of the first Temple and that of the second Temple.

וכנען ילד, Put (Cham’s third son) is not mentioned as having had any offspring. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 37,2 say that the offspring of Put was “swallowed,” (remained unidentified) until the time of the prophet Ezekiel who made mention of it in Ezekiel 30,5 where we read כוש ופוט ולוד  (compare also Ezekiel 27,10) Rabbi Yoseph Kara asked Rabbi Shemuel, seeing that the family of Put was not “swallowed” (i.e. that he was not sterile) why did the Torah not mention the fact that Put did beget offspring? The answer given to Rabbi Kara was that the Torah here wanted to list 70 “sons,” i.e. descendants of Noach. We learn from the number 70 that the nations that resulted from the confusion of the languages mentioned in the next paragraph (10,32) amounted to 70. Put, including all his sons are only considered as one of these 70 nations. If the Torah had written: “Put begat so and so,” how could the Torah have written afterwards in 10,32 ומאלה נפרדו הגוים בארץ וגו', “and from these the nations on earth emerged separately, etc.?” The impression that would have been created then would have been that all these nations are offspring of the sons of Noach and not of Noach himself, as the total then would have amounted to 71 and we would have had to deduct Noach in order to arrive at the correct count. In other words, Put’s offspring’s names not being listed means that it was lumped together with the father as founder of one of the nations.

הבה נבנה לנו עיר, according to the plain meaning and the commonly held opinion that the people of that time were punished for their grandiose plan of building a Tower which was meant to reach the heaven, what are we to make of Deuteronomy 1,28 in which Moses described cities of the Canaanites as having walls as high as the heaven? Why were these walls not destroyed by G’d? We must revise our opinion of why the people were punished, and accept that their principal sin was in not fulfilling G’d’s basic directive to be fruitful, to multiply, and to populate the whole earth, not just a small valley. Their declared objective had been not to scatter (verse 4) The fact that G’d forcefully scattered them afterwards shows that their sin must have been their failure to do so voluntarily.

ודור רביעי ישובו הנה, anyone interpreting these words as referring to the fourth generation of Israelites is in error. Seeing that G'd had already told Avram that the process of inheriting the land of Canaan would not be complete until after 400 years from the time his true seed had been born, what was the point in telling him how many generations down the line this would occur? Until the 400 years would be up, G'd's promise would not be due for fulfillment in any event! The reason G'd mentioned the "fourth generation" was to explain to Avram why the delay in fulfilling His promise would require 400 ears. A generation in those days was considered a period of 100 years, as we know from Ediyot 12,9 so that 400 years equal 4 generations. We know from the second of the Ten Commandments, (Exodus 20,5 that G'd frequently extends His patience to sinners and their offspring until the fourth generation, waiting if finally someone will redeem the errant parents and grandparents by returning to the true lifestyle approved by G'd. This is why G'd described the sin of the Emorites at this time as לא שלם, "not complete," in the sense of not yet irreversible, עד הנה until such time.

Chapter 16



Chapter 17



Chapter 18



Verse 1

'וירא אליו ה. In what manner did G’d appear to Avraham here? Three men, who turned out to be angels came to him. There are numerous examples in Scripture where the angels or a single angel are described as “G’d”, i.e. seeing they are G’d’s agents they are described as ה', even though what is meant is an agent, an angel. To mention just one or two such examples: Exodus 23,21 כי שמי בקרבו, “because My Holy Name is within him.” Or, Exodus 3 3,2 וירא אליו מלאך ה' בלבת אש מתוך הסנה, “an angel of Hashem appeared to him in the form of a flame of fire in the midst of the thorn bush.” [the unusual fire which failed to consume, destroy, the thorn bush represented a Divine appearance. Ed.] Or, in verse 4 of the same chapter: וירא ה' כי סר לראות, “when G’d (i.e. the angel) saw that he had turned aside to watch the spectacle.” 
כחום היום, why would the Torah need to relate this apparently inconsequential piece of information (so that we read it aloud every week after over 3000 years)? The point the Torah wanted to make was that in the event that we compare Lot’s reception of the angels, when he offered them lodging for the night, (Genesis 19,1) whereas Avraham only offered light refreshment, the reason for this is that the angels came to Lot in the evening, a time for travelers to find lodging, whereas here, seeing that they arrived during the midday heat, there was no reason to assume that they would not want to continue their journey.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

כי על כן עברתם על עבדכם. We have a similar construction in Genesis 19,8. It is customary for Scripture to omit the word אשר in such instances, although the reader might have expected it.

Verse 6

CHOICE FLOUR.  Wheat flour, for wherever it says "solet," it is from wheat, as is expounded from the consecration offering, where it is written (Ex. 29:2), "make these of choice wheat flour" [solet hitim].

Verse 7

THEN ABRAHAM RAN TO THE HERD.  Since he told them (v.5) "a morsel of bread," a small quantity, since their journey required them to go, he had to run and hurry, since he said to them a little and he did much.  All this was written to recount Abraham's importance [magnanimity].

Verse 8

ויקח חמאה וחלב, according to the plain meaning of the text there was no need to report that Avraham supplied the bread which he had volunteered to serve these men. It was only necessary to list the additional items he served, seeing no mention had been made of them thus far.
עומד עליהם, when a person is seated and someone else stands beside him, the one standing is referred to with the preposition עליו. Compare Isaiah 6,1-2 ראיתי את ה' יושב על כסא ושרפים עומדים ממעל לו. “I saw G’d seated on a throne and the Seraphim were standing beside Him.” [it is hardly likely that Isaiah in this vision saw the angels as standing above G’d. Ed.] A similar construction is found in Kings I 22,19 involving a vision by Michyahu in response to Yehoshaphat’s request.
תחת העץ, a reference to trees, as in an orchard. 


Verse 9

?איה שרה אשתך, even though the angels knew Sarah’s whereabouts they asked, just as G’d did in Genesis 3,9 when He asked Adam about his whereabouts although He knew full well where Adam was. A similar situation is found in Numbers 22,9 when G’d asked Bileam who the men were who had come to spends the night with him. G’d knew perfectly well who they were.

Verse 10

כעת חיה, she would give birth at the appropriate time. The word appears in this context in Michah 5,2 כעת יולדה בן,”until she who is to bear has given birth.” It is also  found describing the state of Jewish mothers giving birth as being equivalent to that of midwives. (Exodus 1,19)
והוא אחריו, the entrance to Sarah’s tent was behind the angel. This accounts for Sarah overhearing their conversation.


Verse 11



Verse 12

 עדנה, a form of the skin becoming elastic and the wrinkles straightening out.

Verse 13

'ויאמר ה, the angel, the senior of the three.
ואני זקנתי, for she had referred to her menopause in verse12.

Verse 14

'היפלא מה, Who is the One Who has sent us. דבר, anything, no matter how miraculous? When reference is made here as in verse 19 when the Torah writes: “G’d made it rain, etc.” to G’d’s angels, messengers, who are given the status of Divinity while carrying out their assignments, in this instance the first time the word ה' appears it refers to the angel Gavriel, in the second instance to Hashem.

Verse 15

כי צחקת. “but you did laugh.” On most occasions when we encounter the word כי after the word לא, it means “but.” Actually, the word כי can have four different meanings, depending on the context in which it appears (Rashi). The meanings are: if, maybe, but, for. Examples of כי meaning “but,” are Exodus 23,24 לא תשתחוה להם כי הרוס  תהרסם, “do not bow down to them but destroy them utterly.” Or, Deut. 15,7-8: לא תקפוץ את ידך כי פתוח תפתח, “do not ball your hand into a fist, but open it wide, etc.”

Verse 16

ויקומו משם האנשים, two of them went on to Sodom, as we read afterwards ויבואו שני המלאכים סדומה, “the two angels arrived in Sodom” (Genesis 19,1) The senior one of the angels had been the one who had spoken to Avraham. This is implied by the verse וה' אמר המכסה אני מאברהם וגו', “Shall I conceal from Avraham what I am about to do?” in verse 17.


Verse 17

המכסה אני מאברהם, the fact that I am about to overturn Sodom and its satellite towns. G’d reasoned seeing that Avraham was sure to tell his descendants of G’d’s promise to him to give the whole land of Canaan to his descendants, He would diminish these descendants’ inheritance by utterly destroying these towns and the valley which were part of area promised to the Jewish people as an inheritance. He therefore felt duty-bound to obtain Avraham’s consent of what He was about to do. We had learned in Genesis 10,19 that the boundaries of the Canaanite extended to regions that included the Jordan valley. G’d considered it inappropriate to deny Avraham fulfillment of part of His promise by making these parts of the land of Canaan totally useless to its inhabitants.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

'ויאמר ה, the angel said to Avraham that G’d had said that He dispatched these messengers on account of the outcry in heaven over the sins of Sodom, a reference to what G’d had mentioned in 13,13.

Verse 21

עשו כלה, the vertical line after the word עשו is like a comma between these words, i.e. “if they have done as reported, I will put an end to them.”

Verse 22



Verse 23

תספה, the same as תכלה, “you will destroy.” The word is used in the same sense in Deuteronomy 32,23 אספה עלימו רעות חצי אכלה אכלה בם. “I shall accumulate evils against them; My arrows I shall use up against them.” The root כלה expresses the same thought as אספה but in more intense form.

Verse 24

בתוך העיר, Sodom. The king of Sodom was the senior monarch of all the satellite towns surrounding Sodom.

Verse 25

השופט כל הארץ, a reference to the angels whom G’d had dispatched as His representatives, לא יעשה משפט, “will not mete out fair justice?”

Verse 26

'ויאמר ה, the angel replied, the one in whose presence Avraham had remained standing in verse 22. He had appealed to the angel.

Chapter 19



Verse 1



Verse 2

כי ברחוב נלין, the same as if the Torah had written אלא ברחוב נלין, “but we will spend the night in the street.”

Verse 3



Verse 4

כל העם מקצה, the Torah mentions this detail in order to show us that there was not even a single Sodomite who would qualify for saving, as suggested by Avraham in the event there would be 10 righteous people there.

Verse 5

ונדעה אותם. A euphemism for committing sodomy with these strangers. The same expression as a euphemism is also found in Judges 19,22.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

כי על כן,”seeing that they have already באו, come”.

Verse 9

גש הלאה, This construction is similar to Isaiah 65.5 אל תגע בי כי קדשתיך, “do not touch me for I have consecrated you.” In other words: “get closer to a more distant place,” or simpler: “flee from us.”
בא לגור, Lot actually dwelled inside Sodom.
נרע לך מהם, we will do more harm to you than to them.


Verse 10



Verse 11

בסנורים, a plague of blindness.
וילאו, they wearied and were unable למצוא הפתח, they gave up trying to find the doorway. We find the word נלאו describing the inability of the Egyptians to find water after digging for it when Moses had turned the waters of the Nile in to blood. (Exodus 7,18-21) There are numerous instances when the word is used when it expresses a total inability, such as in Jeremiah 20,9 ונלאתי כלכל לא אוכל, “I was totally unable to restrain.” Compare also Isaiah 16,12 כי נלאה מואב על הבמה ובא אל מקדשו להתפלל ולא יוכל, “when it became clear that Moav had gained nothing in the outdoor shrine, he shall come to pray inside his temple, also to no avail.” Job 4,2 also employs the word נלאה in a similar sense.


Verse 12

?עוד מי לך פה, do you have any other relatives in the city apart from those in your house?

Verse 13

וישלחנו, although in other instances when the word שלח is used it never has a dagesh, reinforcing it, here, seeing the dispatch of these angels was not in order to assist, but in order to destroy, this is indicated by the change in the mode and reinforcing the word with the dot in the letter ל. We find another example of this construction in a similar context in Deut. 32,24, ושן בהמות אשלח בם, “the teeth of beasts I will set loose against them,” where the verb שלח is also used destructively. The same is true of Psalms 78,45, ישלח בהם ערב “He dispatched ferocious beasts against them.” 

Verse 14



Verse 15

וכמו השחר עלה, the reason the Torah wrote this verse is seeing that it says in verse 23 that Lot had arrived in Tzoar as the sun had risen, this would have been at least 1-2 hours later than the early dawn described here. In other words, the angels delayed carrying out their mission for a considerable period all out of fondness for Avraham, so that his nephew would not perish in Sodom. [I suppose that seeing that Lot had tarried the whole night he could not now save his livestock and chattels, as the time for this had elapsed. Ed.]

Verse 16



Verse 17

אל תביט אחריך, first of all on account of their going to experience the anguish of seeing the destruction of their city; secondly, in order not to afford them an opportunity to see the angels performing their destructive work as angels when there was no need for them to witness this. Watching divine beings in action and being saved by such spectacles requires Divine intervention and should therefore be avoided. Compare the awe with which Manoach comments on what he has seen in Judges 13,22, as well as Yaakov’s reaction in Genesis 32,31 after his wrestling match with the angel of Esau.

Verse 7

כי נביא הוא, the expression נביא, is based on ניב שפתים, (Isaiah 57,19) “words of comfort, heartening words.” He is familiar to Me, he speaks My language, and I love to listen to his prayer.
ויתפלל בעדך, and he will pray on your behalf. Avimelech and entourage were in need of G’d’s mercy, as we know from verse 18.

Verse 12

אחותי בת אבי, grandchildren are treated just like children and Sarah was a granddaughter of Terach.
אך לא בת אמי, however she is not a sister who was born to my biological mother. This is why she is permitted for me to marry, and she became my wife.

Verse 13

כאשר התעו אותי, He exiled me from my home by ordering me “go forth for yourself from your homeland.” (12,1). This is the true meaning of Deut. 26,5 ארמי אובד אבי. Yaakov’s troubles stemmed from having been exiled from his father’s home, at the behest of his father, whereas Avraham’s exile was at the behest of G’d. Both the expression התעו אותי and אובד אותי are repeats of the same expression similar to Psalms 119,176 תעיתי כשה אובד, “I wandered without destination, lost like a sheep.” Lost sheep were my companions, their shepherd having misled them.
אמרי לי, “say concerning me.”


Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

ולשרה אמר, words of appeasement and consolation, explaining to her that when he had first taken her he had not employed forceful means but had treated her as if she had been a willing bride, giving her a dowry as was customary in those days for the groom to do. He had given 1000 pieces of silver to her brother, seeing that he had assumed that Avraham was no more than her brother to her as he had been led to believe. She herself had said so. This is not to be confused with the livestock which Avimelech gave Avraham at the conclusion of this story, the gifts mentioned in verse 14. The 1000 pieces of silver he had given before Sarah was taken to his palace. Even Pharaoh who had been punished more severely had made generous gifts not only to Avraham but even Lot had been enriched. (12,15). All this had been before any marriage ceremony. Avimelech clearly had been at least as generous.
נתתי אלף כסף, the distant past tense, i.e. “I had given it “ at the very beginning. The same sequence occurred when Pharaoh abducted Sarah, and the same procedure was offered by Shechem and Chamor in Genesis 34,12 as part of the offer to marry Dinah. Also, in Genesis 24,53 we find Eliezer making such generous gifts prior to obtaining Lavan’s consent for Rivkah to marry Yitzchok.
הנה הוא לך כסות עינים לכל אשר אתך ואת כל, the thousand pieces of silver I had given to your brother represent a great honour for you, and they will serve as proof for one and all that you have not been disgraced in any way. Nobody will ever be able to claim that you have been treated as helpless, as a woman who had no honour to lose.
כסות עינים, they will not be able to look at you as someone who had been discredited. We find the word כסה used in a similar sense in Exodus 10,5 וכסה את עין הארץ, “it (the locust) will cover the visible part of the earth, i.e. the earth will not be “naked,” “exposed.” A similar sequence appears in this sense in Ezekiel 28,17 לראוה בך, “so that they may gaze upon,” (not turn away in shame and disgust). The expression also occurs in a similar sense in Micah 7,10 עיני תראינה בה, “my eyes shall behold her.”
ונוכחת, you will be able to hold your head high in view of the fact that you have been treated with so much honour and respect. Avimelech said all this in honour of Sarah and not as a rebuke to her.

כי הניקה שרה בנים, such a prophecy that Sarah who had become old without ever conceiving would nurse children could only have emanated from the One and only G’d! 


Verse 8

ויגמל, he was separated from depending on his mother’s nipples.
 We find a similar expression in connection with Samuel I 1,23 referring to the day he was weaned. Such days were marked by a feast. Chanah brought Samuel to Eli in Shiloh at the time. (Samuel I 1,24)

Verse 9

מצחק, in the meantime Ishmael was already 16 years old. Sarah did not want him to remain in the same household any longer so that he would not get ideas about sharing in the inheritance with Yitzchok.

Verse 12

יקרא לך זרע, a reference to the covenant between G’d and Avraham, which included that Avraham’s seed would remain strangers in a land not theirs before they would inherit the land of Canaan (15,13). G’d reminded him that his promise referred to Yitzchok and not to Ishmael.

Verse 13



Verse 14

ותתע במדבר באר שבע, that is why she ran out of water, a supply of which she had carried with her. Avraham had given her a big enough supply if she would have taken the direct route to Beer Sheva.

Verse 16



Verse 17

באשר הוא שם, seeing she could not see him from the place where she had sat down, the angel had to use this manner of referring to Ishmael. He would be provided with water at that location.

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

רובה קשת. Pulling the string of a bow. We are dealing with two successive forms of an activity, as in Genesis 49,23 וימררוהו ורבו, “they shot at him and harried him.” [I am choosing this translation of the JPS seeing that in both verse 23 and 24 where the “bow” and the “arrows” are mentioned. Ed.] The expressionרובה  as a variation of רבב is found in Job 16,13 as it is in Psalms 48,13, where it is derived from the root סבב. A construction שומו as a derivative of שמם is found in Jeremiah 2,12, just as the construction דומו derived from דמם is found in Isaiah 23,2. Also, the expression דממה דקה, a very low voice, in Kings I 19,12 is a similar construction. The common feature in all these constructions is that the last root letter appears twice in succession. Our example of רובה is different, seeing that there is no such repetition of the last root letter. Therefore its root is רבה, and the construction is similar to עושה from עשה, or בונה from בנה, or קונה from קנה.


Verse 21

במדבר פארן, as predicted in 16,12 והוא יהיה פרא אדם.

Verse 22

ויהי בעת ההיא, at the time when Yitzchok was born by Sarah and Avimelech had become a first-hand witness to the miracles G’d had performed for Avraham. This is why he and his chief general were now interested in concluding an alliance with Avraham. Every time the expression בעת ההיא occurs it must be understood in terms of happenings immediately preceding the ones to which the next paragraph is linked.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

ויהי אחר הדברים האלה, whenever we find the construction אחר הדברים האלה what follows is conceptually immediately following what has been reported immediately before. Examples are found in 15,1 after Avraham had killed the four kings who had taken Lot captive. At that time G’d had told him not to be afraid of any repercussions. We also find such a construction in verse 20 of our chapter where the Avraham was informed of the birth of Rivkah after we heard that Yitzchok had been born. We find a similar construction also in Esther 3,1 where Mordechai told Esther and she told the king about the assassination plot by Bigtan and Teresh. The event occurred around the time when Haman was promoted and wanted to kill Mordechai and the Jewish people. The fact that he had saved the king’s life became the immediate cause of Mordechai’s rise in the king’s esteem. [if I understand the author correctly, he wants to tell us that although sequentially the matters related are not immediate chronologically, the Torah or Scriptures use the formulation to trace them to events which occurred some time back. Yitzchok was at least 37 years old before Avraham heard about the birth of Rivkah. Similarly, if the king had rewarded Mordechai for his part in discovering the plot immediately, history might have taken a different course. Ed.] Here too, the words mean that what follows occurred after Avraham and Avimelech had concluded their covenant according to which until the fourth generation Avraham’s descendants would not register a claim against lands owned by the Philistines at this time. G’d became very angry at this high-handed action by Avraham, seeing that he had given away lands which were part of what G’d had promised to Avraham and his descendants at the “covenant of the pieces” in chapter 15. We know that a condition of that covenant had been not to allow a single soul of the Canaanites to survive in that land, according to both Deuteronomy 20,16 as well as according to Joshua 13,3 and 15,45-47. Clearly lots had been cast concerning the lands owned by the 5 Philistine rulers, and who was to settle in those lands after the conquest. As a result of Avraham’s high-handed action,
והאלוקים נסה את אברהם, G’d now subjected Avraham to a painful test, something which was bound to cause him grief. Whenever the root נסה occurs, such as in Job 4,2 or Exodus 17,7 or Psalms 26,2 the connotation is an unpleasant one for the one being subjected to it. In this instance, G’d, so to speak, indicated to Avraham that he had been foolish to think that he could guarantee’s Yitzchok’s and his descendants well being into the future, as he might have to terminate his life before he even had produced any offspring who would be called upon to honour his father’s deal with Avimelech. We find that the ark of the covenant spent seven months in Philistine captivity as a result of Avraham having made such an unauthorised pact with Avimelech (Samuel I 6,1). The seven months corresponded to the seven sheep Avraham had gratuitously given to Avimelech. G’d swore that as a result the Philistines would fight seven wars against the Israelites in which they would be victorious. These wars occurred during the time of Shimshon, Chofni, Pinchos, Sha-ul, and the three sons of Sha-ul who were killed. Another approach: as a result of Avraham’s high-handed act seven altars (public altars equivalent of temples) were destroyed by the enemies of the Jewish people after they entered the Holy Land Land, They were: Moses’ Tabernacle, Gilgal, Nov, Shiloh, Givon and the two Temples in Jesrusalem. (copied from Midrash Shemuel by the editor of Rash’bam) According to still another version G’d’s ark would repose in the land of the Philistines for 7 months.
ה' נסה, the words mean קונטריה, “G’d rebuked Avraham.”

Verse 2

המוריה, same as האמוריה, “the land of the Emorite.” It happens frequently that the letter א is missing, just as in our verse. One such example is found in Exodus 10,21 וימש חשך, where the word וימש should really have been ויאמש חשך, “causing darkness.” Another example of the letter א being missing is found in Isaiah 13,20, where instead of לא יהל we would have expected לא יאהל, “he will pitch his tent.”

Verse 13

וירא והנה איל, passing by in front of him
אחר נאחז בסבך בקרניו, getting enmeshed in the thicket with its horns after Avraham had seen it. He reasoned that surely this must be a message from the angel who had caused this ram to become entangled at the command of G’d so that he, Avraham, could offer it in place of his son Yitzchok. This is also the meaning of Psalms 68,26 קדמו שרים אחר נוגנים, “first come the singers, afterwards the musicians.” A similar meaning of the word אחר is found in Ecclesiastes 12,2 ושבו העבים אחר הגשם, “the clouds return after the rain.” Another example of the word אחר having the same meaning as here is found in Exodus 5,1 ואחר באו משה ואהרן, “after (what had occurred before) Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh.”


Verse 14

אשר יאמר היום, “of which its is being said today and tomorrow that G’d had manifested Himself to Avraham at this mountain of the Lord.”

Chapter 23



Verse 1

ויהיו חיי שרה, even though the Torah never revealed the ages of other women, in Sarah’s case it became necessary to inform us of this, as her death was directly related to the purchase of the cave of Machpelah. The Torah therefore told us for how many years Sarah lived after having become a mother at the advanced age of 90.

Verse 2

בקרית ארבע, the name of the person who founded or owned this town was Arba. We know this from Joshua 15,13 where he is described as the father of a giant. The reference to a town by mentioning an outstanding citizen is familiar to us from Numbers 21,27-29 where the capital of the Emorites is described as קרית סיחון, the city of Sichon.
ויבא אברהם, even if he did not arrive from out of town it is perfectly in order to describe his arrival in order to mourn Sarah by the words ויבא אברהם. [Clearly, the author considers Avraham as having lived uninterruptedly in Beer Sheva ever since were told this in 22,19. Ed.]


Verse 3



Verse 4

גר ותושב אנכי, I have come from a distant land to sojourn here, but in the meantime I have made myself at home amongst you. Since I did not have parents here, I also have no ancestral burial plots.
תנו לי אחוזת קבר, allocate to me a burial plot which will be mine in all future, deeded. He wanted to buy a plot of land for the express purpose of burying his dead. Such a piece of land deeded in perpetuity, i.e. אחוזה, required the approval of all the local populace. This matter becomes even clearer when Avraham tenders the money for the field and cave to Efron, the former owner, and the Torah goes on to laboriously describe the bureaucratic procedure that had to be followed until Avraham could lay Sarah to rest. (17-19)

(3) MIL'FANAI [FROM BEFORE ME].  I will take it out from before me to bury it.

Verse 5



Verse 6

 נשיא אלוהים, “a prince of G’d,” neither stranger or resident stranger as Avraham had described himself.
(2) IN THE CHOICEST OF OUR BURIAL PLACES. In the place where we bury the chiefs of the land, and here is a grave already prepared.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

מערת המכפלה, any depression in the surface of the earth is called מכפלה, as the ככר הירדן, refers to the entire Jordan valley (13,10). This is substantiated by the Torah describing Efron’s field as being located in מכפלה in verse 18 of our chapter.

Verse 10



Verse 11


(2) AND THE CAVE THAT IS IN IT. You are asking only for the cave that is at the end of the field, and by sale; I am giving you as a gift the whole field and the cave.

Verse 14



Verse 15

ארץ..ארבע מאות שקל, “a land which is not worth more than 400 shekel silver, what is this worth talking about?
 Take it and bury your dead for free if you so desire.”

Verse 16

וישמע אברהם, he understood what Efron was hinting at and did not want to spell out.
עובר לסוחר, silver minted into coins, refined silver acceptable without question anywhere. The expression עובר in that sense occurs also in Kings II 12,5 in connection with Yehoyakim, i.e. כסף עובר, as well as in Song of Songs 5,5 ואצבעותי מור עובר, “ a reference to the best quality of myrrh.


Verse 17



Verse 18

לאברהם למקנה, “it arose” after Avraham had paid the money, a normal procedure which we are familiar with from the (misquote) in Erchin 33 ונתן הבסף וקם לו. The purchase was concluded in verse 18, i.e. the field became a מקנה for Avraham. It became an ancestral piece of property only after Sarah had actually been buried there, i.e. after the purpose of the transaction had been carried out (verse 20)

Chapter 24



Verse 1

1 He was advanced in years.  This is to say, the time had come to marry off his son during his lifetime.
2. And God blessed Abraham [with everything] - this is to inform/explain to us about what is said in [the text in] front of us, that Abraham did not send his servant to take a wife [for Isaac] on account of lack of women in the Land of Canaan or because no one wanted to mate with him, because Abraham had been blessed with everything and the entire world desired to mate with Isaac, but because he only wanted a spouse for Isaac from his family.  This is why Abraham's servant said: "And Adonai blessed my master very much and he has become wealthy."  And it is for this reason that the text needed to explain first that God had blessed Abraham "with everything," as in a similar instance: "And Ham was the father of Canaan" (Genesis 9:18).  

Verse 2

PUT YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH.  And similarly with Yosef when he swore to Ya'akov.  The making of a covenant or an oath of a son, or of a slave to his master was in this fashion, for they shared the aspect of subjugation, and it is thus written (Mal. 1:6), "A son should honor his father, and a slave his master."  However, handshaking or cutting an object in two for a covenant and passing between the pieces is found with other persons.

Verse 3



Verse 4

כי אם אל ארצי, not to members of any nation which does not dwell physically close to the region from which I originate. This is where you shall go to conduct your search.

Verse 5

?ההשב אשיב את בנך, to the land of your ancestors? He meant that even though he might not find there any members of Avraham’s former family. He still referred to this as a השבה “a return.”

Verse 6



Verse 7

אלוקי השמים, the One Who has brought me here and has granted me seed in this country (whereas previously I had no offspring) He surely would not want me to now bring back my son to the land He made me leave. If He did, what point was there in His making me move here in the first place?
This is why I am certain that ישלח מלאכו, He will send His angel to make your mission successful to ensure that He can fulfill His promise. 


Verse 8



Verse 9

על הדבר הזה, concerning the condition stipulated by Avraham.

Verse 10

וכל טוב אדוניו, the important people in Avraham’s household. This is why they are referred to as האנשים, a complimentary description, in verse 54.

Verse 11

ויברך הגמלים, a camel has two knees one above the other; therefore it needs two motions to go down on its knees and because of its height it cannot drink before having thus lowered itself to the level of the trough. This is what the sages referred to in Chulin 76 when they said וכנגדו בגמל ניכר, that a spot known as the ארכובה in cattle is clearly recognisable on the foreleg of a camel.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

אותה הוכחת, she is the one whom You have appointed to be Yitzchok’s wife. The word אותה excludes the possibility of any other girl being the proper wife for Yitzchok.

Verse 15



Verse 16

ואיש לא ידעה, she had not even engaged in fondling with a man. She was extremely chaste.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

והאיש משתאה, the word is derived from Isaiah 6,11 תשאה שממה, and the letter ת is similar to the letter ת in the word ישתבח which is derived from שבח, or the ת in the word וישתמר in the phrase וישתמר חוקות עמדי, which is derived from the root שמר, (compare Micah 6,16). Here the word משתאה means the same as משתומם, being amazed at this girl volunteering that she would also draw water for his camels. From these words of her he understood that G’d had heard his prayer. Commentators who understand the word משתאה as being related to שתייה, drink, are in error. Such an interpretation is impossible, seeing that the letter א in that word cannot be related to שתייה at all. Furthermore, Rivkah had not mentioned anything about watering the camels until after he himself had finished drinking already. At that point Eliezer began to wonder.


Verse 22

ויקח האיש נזם זהב, one is entitled to assume that Eliezer first had asked her about whose family she belonged to (verse 23) The reason why things were not written in this order is in order not to interrupt the sequence of the story by questions and answers. This is why the Torah reported first about Eliezer giving Rivkah the jewelry.
בקע, a half shekel in weight. The word occurs in a similar meaning in Exodus 14,15 נטה ידך על הים ובקעהו, “incline your hand over the sea and divide it!”


Verse 23

מקום לנו ללין. Is there room in your father’s house to stay the night so that we do not have to spend the night in an inn?
ללין, the word לין is a noun, just as the word ריב in Deuteronomy 25,1כי יהיה ריב בין אנשים , “when there is a quarrel between men, etc.” is a noun. It is a derivative of Genesis 31,36 וירב בלבן, he “(Yaakov) quarreled with Lavan.” The word דין is a similar noun derived  from דן אנכי in Genesis 15,14. לין is in a similar relationship to Genesis 32,14 וילן שם בלילה הוא, “he spent that night there.” (the night of the wrestling match with the angel on the far side of the river Yabbok) Rivkah’s answer גם מקום ללון  (as opposed to the word ללין in Eliezer’s enquiry) meant that there is room for you and your men’s bodies to spend the night with us. The formulation ללון is a verbal formulation just as in Genesis 31,35 לקום, where Rachel excuses herself for not rising in the presence of her father. It is also similar to the formulation (verbal infinitive) לשוב מצרימה “to return to Egypt” in Exodus 4,21. If Rivkah had said: גם מקום לכם, she would have had to continue with the word ללין instead of the word ללון. Whereas the word לנו used by Eliezer meant that he and his men would be prepared to spend the night where the camels spent it, the word ללון after the word עמנו, “with us,” which clearly refers to Rivkah and her family, i.e. accommodation designed for human beings. She therefore meant to say: “why would you need to spend the night at an inn? This is the correct meaning as understood by people who understand the nuances of the Holy Tongue, i.e. Hebrew as written in the Torah.


Verse 24



Verse 25

גם תבן, also straw, something which you did not inquire about as well as lodging, something which you did inquire about. It is a habit of Scriptures to use the word גם, “also,” repeatedly, even if this is not strictly necessary in order to correctly understand the text.

Verse 31



Verse 32

ויפתח, the word is used in the same sense as in Kings I 20,11 אל יתהלל חוגר כמפתח, “let not him who girds on his sword boast like him who ungirds it.”

Verse 33

עד אם דברתי דברי. Having noted that G’d had indicated that He approved of the way he had been handling his assignment, Eliezer concluded that he must not eat and drink until he had concluded his mission.

Verse 34



Verse 35

ברך את אדוני, this is why the Torah wrote at the beginning of the chapter that “The Lord had blessed Avraham in everything.”<br> ויגדל, all leading political figures in the country were anxious to become related to him through marriage.

ויתן לו את כל אשר לו, his brother will not share in the inheritance with Yitzchok.

Verse 48

בדרך אמת, on a Divine mission to perform a deed of loving kindness for my master Avraham as well as for his son.

Verse 49

על ימין או על שמאל , to other relatives of his family.

Verse 50

לא נוכל דבר אליך רע או טוב, the success or failure of His plan is not up to us to either confirm or thwart. This has been fated by G’d regardless of whether we like it or not. G’d will accomplish His will as He has the power to bring this about.

Verse 51



Verse 52



Verse 53

כלי כסף וכלי זהב, women’s jewelry made of either silver or gold similar to what is described in Numbers 31,50 איש אשר מצא כלי זהב אצעדה וגו', “if someone found golden jewelry such as, etc.” A similar verse appears in Exodus 3,22 where G’d promises that at the Exodus the Jewish women will request from their neighbours and will receive כלי כלי כסף וכלי זהב ושמלות, “silver and golden jewelry and fine garments and they will dress their children in these.”

Verse 54



Verse 55



Verse 56

וה' הצליח דרכי, clearly G’d does not want that the matter suffer any delay seeing that something which experiences delay, obstacles, cannot truly be considered as being successful.

Verse 57

נקרא לנערה, to find out if she wants to delay her move to your master’s country by a year or ten months, or if she wants to go now as you have said.

Verse 58

ויקראו לרבקה, a matter of common courtesy. Even though G’d had already ,made clear what His wishes were in the matter, tell us what your own wishes are in this matter, if you want to go immediately. עם האיש הזה, with this man or with someone else as your guide after the lapse of 10 months or a year. The question was relevant, seeing that we had explained that it was customary to give a bride (virgin) 12 months to prepare herself for such a radical adjustment as moving from her parents’ home to that of her husband. 
ותאמר אלך, I do not need all this time in order to prepare my trousseau.


Verse 59



Verse 60

את היי לאלפי רבבה ויירש דרעך, may all these children originate from you, as it had been said to Avraham at the time of the binding of Yitzchok: “your descendants will conquer the gates of their enemies” (22,17) according to the commentary of Rabbi Joseph Karo.

Verse 61



Verse 62

ויצחק בא מבוא, an expression meaning the same as Genesis 10,19 בואכה סדומה. On that day, the day that Eliezer arrived, Yitzchok arrived from his visit to באר לחי רואי. 
יושב בארץ הנגב, the area in which the באר לחי רואי is located. (compare Genesis 16,7 על העין בדרך שור.) seeing that he had come from there on that day. This detail is related to show that Yitzchok continued the work of his father who had planted an orchard in that vicinity. (Genesis 20,1) He had gone there to supervise his workers who were supposed to tend the orchard.


Verse 63

ויצא יצחק לשוח בשדה, the word לשוח is basically the same as שיח השדה, “the plants that grow in the field,” (Genesis 2,5). Yitzchok went out to plant useful vegetation, trees, etc., and to check the work of his employees. While he was thus occupied he happened to espy גמלים באים, camels approaching. He came closer to see if per chance they were the camels belonging to his father which the servant Eliezer had been leading. 


Verse 64

ותפול מעל הגמל, a description of her chastity, seeing she had been riding astride the camel just like a man, not side-saddle. (according to Pessachim 3 the former mode of riding, especially on a high animal, affords a better chance to hold on with both hands and feet against falling)

Verse 65

?מי האיש הלזה ההולך בשדה לקראתנו, this verse raises a number of questions. Did Rivkah enquire about the identity of every man that they encountered on this journey? Furthermore, why did the Torah have to write the words בשדה לקראתנו, “in the field toward us?” It appears that the verse is somewhat abbreviated. What Rivkah wanted to know was why the man approaching them had detoured from the regular path and was coming across the field in their direction. 
הלזה, the additional letter ל in this word indicates that the person it refers to, though identifiable, is still a considerable distance away, in fact may not yet be positively identified beyond any doubt. We have the same construction in Genesis 37,19 where the brothers refer to the unexpected appearance of Joseph in the distance. When the person referred to as זה is close by, such as when Esther entertained the King and Haman, she pointed to Haman as המן הרע הזה, “this wicked Haman!” (Esther 7,6)

Verse 66

ויספר העבד ליצחק, to inform him of all the miracles he had encountered on the way to carrying out his mission. This was to convince Yitzchok that Rivkah was destined for him from heaven.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

קטורה, according to the plain meaning of the text this woman was not identical with Hagar.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

הפילגשים, Hagar and Keturah.
מתנות, gifts of large amounts of money.
קדמה אל ארץ קדם, in order that his sons could take possession of the properties he owned there.


Verse 7



Verse 8

בשיבה טובה, as G’d had foretold him in 15,15. He promised that the oppression which Avraham’s descendants would be subjected to would not commence while he was still alive.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

אשר ילדה הגר המצרית, the point of the whole verse is to tell us that the name and significance of Ishmael is not associated with Avraham who fathered him, but with Hagar who had mothered him. When the Torah speaks of Yitzchok, it does not describe him as the son of Sarah, his mother, but as the son of Avraham, his father. (compare verse 19) We find something similar in Ruth 4,18 concerning Peretz who fathered Chetzron.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

ואלה שני חיי ישמעאל, our sages, both in Megillah 17 and Yevamot 64 deal with the reason why the Torah thought it necessary to inform us of Ishmael’s age at his death. According to the plain meaning of the text, the Torah wrote this out of respect for Avraham. Seeing that the Torah had told us of Avraham’s age being 86 when he fathered Ishmael, and it also told us of Ishmael being 13 years of age when he underwent circumcision, it now concludes by telling us Ishmael’s age at his death.


Verse 18

THEY CAMPED [LIT.:  FELL] ALONGSIDE ALL THEIR KINSMEN.  They dwelt, as it is written (Gen. 16:12), "He will dwell alongside all his kinsmen."

Verse 19

אברהם הוליד את יצחק, according to the plain meaning of the text this statement was necessary to prevent the wrong impression being created by the previous statement in verse 12 where Ishmael is described merely as having been born by Hagar the Egyptian woman. Here when Avraham’s principal son, Yitzchok is the subject of the paragraph, it was important to repeat who had fathered him. He was the son of Avraham’s true wife, his lifetime companion, and G’d had predicted in Genesis 21,12 that Avraham’s descendants would always be known through his son Yitzchok and his descendants. We have a similar verse in Chronicles I 1,28 describing Yitzchok and Ishmael as Avraham’s sons, [but not in the chronological order of their births, to remind us that the principle of preference for the firstborn was ignored. Ed.] In connection with the sons of Keturah, described as the concubine of Avraham, Chronicles does not even spell out that Avraham fathered Keturah’s sons. In fact, in verse 34 of that chapter in Chronicles, the fact that Avraham fathered Yitzchok is repeated once more, no such repetition being made concerning Ishmael. 

Verse 20

בן ארבעים שנה, he is described as 60 years old when the twins Esau and Yaakov were born to him by Rivkah. (verse 28) From the combination of these two verses we know that Rivkah had remained barren for 20 years.

Verse 21

ויעתר, an expression denoting a lengthy prayer, as in Ezekiel 35,13 העתרתם עלי דבריכם, “you multiplied your words against Me.”
לנכח, on account of.


Verse 22

ויתרוצצו, a word derived from רץ, “ran,” as for instance in Jeremiah 51,31 לקראת רץ רץ, “runner dashes to meet runner.” The word describes the constant motion of the two fetuses inside Rivkah’s womb. We have a similar construction of the word קם when it appears next to מתקוממים, or the word לן when it occurs next to the word מתלוננים. If the word had been derived from the root רצץ, as for instance in Job 20,19 רצץ עזב דלים, the Torah would have had to write here vayitratzetzu with the vowel patach, instead of vayitrotzetzu with the vowel cholem. We find such a parallel construction in Jeremiah 13,16 ובטרם יתנגפו רגליכם, “and before your feet stumble.”
'לדרוש את ה, an inquiry directed at the prophets that were around in her time. We have a verse in Kings I 22,8 as well as in Exodus 18,15 where this expression describes questions addressed by the common people to the prophet.

Verse 23

ויאמר ה' לה, G’d’s answer was provided by the prophet.
שני גויים, do not be upset, seeing that the additional pain you experience is due to the fact that you will give birth to twins. This normally accounts for a more difficult pregnancy.
ושני לאומים, kingdoms, as per Psalms 148,11 מלכי ארץ וכל לאומים, “all kings and peoples of the earth.” We know that this interpretation is correct as otherwise the words גויים and לאומים would simply be a needless repetition. The word לאומים therefore refers to nations. Seeing that the prophet had already begun to foretell Rivkah part of the future, he continued further adding:
ורב יעבוד צעיר, that the younger one would in fact be senior to the older one; as a result of this prophecy Rivkah loved Yaakov more than Esau already from birth.


Verse 24

והנה תומים whenever the Torah speaks about something new it uses the expression והנה in connection with this. Thus we find it in 29,25 where Yaakov is reported as finding that he had slept with Leah instead of with Rachel as he had thought. In 41,7 we also find the expression הנה when Pharaoh awakens from what he thought was a factual experience only to find that it had been a dream.

Verse 25

(1) ADMONI. Roux in O.F.
אדמוני כאדרת שער, like the garments worn by the clergy.
ויקראו, they all called him
עשו, fully matured, complete due to the fact that he was covered with hair.

Verse 26



Verse 27

יודע ציד, hunting venison and retrieving the animal to serve as food.
יושב אהלים, tending his father’s flocks as we explained already in connection with 4,20 יושב אהל ומקנה.


Verse 28

כי ציד בפיו, the plain meaning corresponds to Onkelos, i.e. because he brought him venison to eat.
אוהבת את יעקב, for she was aware of his perfection, also because the prediction to her of the prophet had been that the senior son would be subservient to the junior one. The Torah had to mention first that Yitzchok loved Esau in order for us to understand what had motivated to bless Esau, and what had motivated Rivkah to deceive him into blessing Yaakov.


Verse 29



Verse 30

מן האדום האדום הזה, it is common for a person who is in a hurry and who demands something from his fellow to repeat his request. In this instance, seeing that Esau was both tired and hungry, his choice of words is equivalent to asking to get something to eat in a hurry.
על כן קרא שמו אדום, a reference to his reddish appearance at birth, described in verse 25. It foreshadowed that he had a craving for red-looking food. He sold his birthright in order to gratify his carving for something red to eat. The nickname אדום is an insulting, derogatory term.


Verse 31

מכרה כיום, meaning: “immediately!” Sell me your share of the birthright which you are entitled to from our father’s estate which I will give you. After that I will give you to eat as proof of the sale and as confirmation. We find a similar transaction in Genesis 31,46 where Yaakov and Lavan ate in order to confirm their non-aggression pact.

Verse 32

הנה אנכי הולך למות, I am going into the forest day after day to hunt in an area full of bears, lions and other ferocious beasts, and I am risking my life on a daily basis. What point would there be in my waiting until our father dies and I get my share of the birthright? This is the way my father Rabbi Meir interpreted Esau’s words in this verse. This is the meaning of “Esau despised the birthright.” (verse 34).

Verse 33

וימכור את בכורתו, in exchange for money. After this Yaakov gave Esau the reddish looking dish of lentils he had cooked, as is customary among people sealing a bargain.

Verse 34

ויבז עשו, seeing that eventually Esau regretted having sold his birthright, as we know from 27,36 the Torah goes on record here that he had despised the birthright and had no right to go back on the bargain he had made in full knowledge of what it entailed.
ויבז, the word is equivalent to Numbers 15,31 ויבזה from את דבר ה' בזה, the construction being parallel to ויקן as a form of the past tense קנה, “he bought, he acquired” (Genesis 33,19)


Chapter 26



Verse 1

מלבד הרעב הראשון אשר היה בימי אברהם, as we read in Genesis 12,10. There was no need for this phrase except to inform us that just as his father Avraham had traveled to Egypt on account of a famine, so now his son was about to emulate his father and to travel to Egypt by way of the land of the Philistines. This was the shortest route to Egypt, as we know from Exodus 13,17. G’d told him not to go to Egypt as he knew what his plans were.

Verse 2



Verse 3

'כי לך ולזרעך וגו, because I have given him and his descendants this land, I have now commanded you not to leave this land which I described as the land I will show you, etc.” in Genesis 12,1.

Verse 4



Verse 5

בקולי , a reference to the binding of Yitzchok where the Torah had used the expression  (22,18) עקב אשר שמעת בקולי, “as a consequence of your heeding My instructions.
וישמור משמרתי, a reference to the circumcision, where G’d had used this expression (את בריתי תשמור) describing the command in 17,9 to circumcise himself.
מצותי, the command to perform circumcision when the baby is eight days old; as in 21,4.
חוקותי ותורותי, basically these include all the laws known to mankind prior to the giving of the Torah, such as not murdering, not stealing, etc. They include virtues such as extending hospitality. At the time the Torah was revealed, these were renewed and elaborated on. At that time the covenant to keep these laws forever was concluded with the Jewish people.


Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

ויהי כי ארכו לו שם, after a while Yitzchok was no longer careful to conduct himself in a manner that the suspicion that Rivkah was his wife could not be aroused. The reason was that he did not think that she would be abducted.
מצחק, engaging in marital intimacy. The same word was used for intimacy by the wife of Potiphar in Genesis 39,17 when she accused Joseph of trying to rape her. [the author brings this example as in Genesis 21,9 this word could not have had the same meaning. Ed.] Potiphar’s wife elsewhere used to word לשכב עמי, “to sleep with me,” to describe Joseph’s supposed conduct (39,14).


Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

בארץ ההיא, even though the soil of this land is exceptionally hard;
בשנה ההיא, a year of general drought and even famine.
מאה שערים, a field which if one plants one measure of seed it produces 100 measures of grain as a harvest.


Verse 13



Verse 14

ועבודה רבה, work in the field and vineyards. The expression עבודה, unless defined differently, additionally, always refers to labour in the field.

Verse 15

סתמום פלשתים, the Philistines had stopped up these wells to ensure that Avraham’s descendants would not be able to use them and to claim the land around them. as their grazing land. The Torah had to record this for us since Avraham’s shepherds had in the meantime pitched their tents a distance from there. We have a parallel to this when the Torah writes in 9,18 חם אבי כנען, Cham, the son of Canaan, although at the time, Canaan had not been born yet. Here too, the verse serves as background to the facts in verse 18, explaining that the servants of Yitzchok were not annexing land for their use which had not already belonged to Avraham with the full consent of Avimelech the king at time.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

אשר קרא להן אביו, in order to prevent anyone in the future to challenge the ownership of the wells.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

ולא רבו עליה, seeing this well was quite a distance from the region where they grazed their livestock, as we know from ויעתק משם, he moved away from there. 

Verse 23

ויעל משם באר שבע, because he was physically afraid of them. We have proof for this, seeing that G’d told him not to be afraid  (verse 24)

Verse 24



Verse 25

ויכרו שם עבדי יצחק באר, Yitzchok did not name this well until his servants had completed it and until after Avimelech had come to him from Gerar suing for peace, and the confirmed their agreement by swearing an oath to each other. At that point his servants came and told him that they had located a new source of water and he called it שבעה as a reminder of the oath that had been sworn on that occasion by both Yitzchok and Avimelech.

Verse 26

מרעהו ואחזת, with an entourage of his friends, as per Onkelos. The expression מרעהו occurs in this sense in Judges 15,6. The prefix מ in the word מרעהו is similar to the same prefix in the מריע ותוקע (Rosh Hashanah 33) [an unusual shift from the simple active mode kal, to the causative mode hiphil for basically the same activity, namely blowing the shofar. Ed.] as well as the מ in Jeremiah 21,4 אנכי מסב את כלי המלחמה, “The author quotes several more examples, as for instance, Proverbs 12,26 יתר מרעהו צדיק, ודרך רשעים תתעם, “the righteous enjoys advantages over his fellow man; the way of the wicked leads him astray.” [If I understand correctly, the letter מ is used transitively, although in this instance in the construction of a noun. Avimelech’s entourage רעהו was meant to give moral support to Avimelech in this ordinarily humiliating undertaking for him. Rash’bam goes as far as understanding the word ויתורו in Numbers 13,2 not as commonly understood as a verbal form of תור, “to tour, to traverse,” but as related to the word יתר from יתרון quoted in his citation from Proverbs 12,26. As to the fact that, if so, he word in Numbers should have been ויתירו instead of ויתורו, he quotes the interchangeable usage or ישוב and ישיב as well as יקום and יקים as examples where the hiphil is also used with the letter ו instead of the letter י for the middle root letter, עיו הפועל. Ed.]

Verse 27



Verse 28

תהי נא אלה, which is בינותינו, between your father and me should remain in force also between בינינו, ובינך, between you and me. This had been part of the condition of that pact that neither Avraham’s children nor grandchildren were allowed to renege on a promise he had made on their behalf. (21,23)


Verse 29

אתה עתה, therefore conclude a pact with us and let us go home, just as we have allowed you to leave our country unmolested.
אתה, you are blessed by the Lord. (verse 31)
(3) BLESSED OF ADONAI.  Similar to "Come, blessed of Adonai," written about Lavan.  And that is what Yitzhak did (v. 31), "they departed from him in peace."

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

על כן שם העיר באר שבע  this was not the same Beer Sheva we read about in connection with Avraham. There were two towns called Beer Sheva, as we know from Kings I 19,3 ויבא באר שבע אשר ליהודה, “he came to Beer Sheva in Yehudah.” [If there had not been another Beer Sheva the additional words “which is in Yehudah” would have been unnecessary. Ed.]

Verse 34

ויהי עשו בן ארבעים שנה, at that point Yitzchok was 100 years old seeing that he had been 60 years old at the time the twins had been born. The only reason the Torah draws our attention to the age at which Esau got married was to give us a better understanding of Yitzchok’s age when he is described as getting old, (27,1) He must have been well over 100 years old by then.

Verse 35

ויקח אשה את יהודית....ותהיין מורת אוח, seeing that Rivkah is reported in 27,46 as becoming fed up with her life if she would have to live to see Yaakov also marry a Canaanite girl, the Torah had to explain what had produced such a prejudice in Rivkah against the local girls.<br>מורת רוח, the construction of the word מורת, with the vowel patach under the letter ר needs to be understood by comparing it to the root עשה, also a root ending with the letter ה. In Psalms 148,8 we have the formulation ossah devaro, which is feminine, seeing it describes the activity of the רוח סערה, a stormy wind, which is feminine. The construct form of the word ossah there would be ossat, Similarly, the word מורת in our verse is a construct form of the feminine form of the word מורה, not with the vowel segol under the letter ר but with the vowel kametz. [as in numerous similar nouns that appear sometimes as feminine and sometimes as masculine. Ed.] The word מורה meaning being contrary, rebellious, also appears in a slightly different form, i.e. ממרה as for instance, in Joshua 1,18 ימרה את פיך, “someone who will rebel against your orders.” When it appears in a genitive, construct form, it becomes morat. In Proverbs 14,10 we encounter a similar construction (though it is written with the vowel kametz under the letter מ) The verse reads: אבל לב יודעת מרת נפשו, “a heart knows its soul’s bitterness.” The use of the chataf kametz  under the letter מ there converts the word from adjective to being a noun. It is derived from מררות, “something bitter.” (compare Deuteronomy 32,32) In our verse here the word מורת is not a noun but a construct form of a verb, similar to Lamentations 1,20 כי מרה מריתי, “for I am experiencing a great deal of distress.” Here (in our verse) the vowel cholem instead of kametz as in Lamentations, is a manifestation of the abbreviated, chataf vowel often found with the middle letter of the root

Chapter 27



Verse 1

ותכהינה עיניו, due to old age, as we find in Samuel I 3,20 when the eyesight of the High Priest Eli failed due to old age.

Verse 2

הנה נא, I beg of you, due to my old age and the fact that I want to bestow on you the blessing which is within my power to bestow, the blessing of Avraham concerning inheriting this land.

Verse 3

שא נא כליך, the reason for the repetition of the word נא both in verse 2 and verse 3 is similar to that in Genesis 12,11 where I have already explained it. [not found there. Ed.]
תלייך¸ his bag containing his arrows.
The word is derived from the root תלה, “to hang,” We find it used in this sense in Genesis 40,22 in connection with Pharaoh hanging the chief of the bakers, as well as in Judges 5,12 where the word שביך בן אבינועם is derived from the root שבה, Similarly, the word עניך in Genesis 16,11 כי שמע ה' אל עניך, “for the Lord has paid heed to your suffering,” is derived from the root ענה.


Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

'לפני ה. “in the name of the Lord.” However, when the same expression לפני ה' occurs in 10,9 describing the prowess of Nimrod as a hunter, the meaning is that his prowess was something of global dimensions, that no other hunter could match him in this respect. Similarly, the expression לאלוקים in Jonah 3,3 describing the vastness of the city of Nineveh, refers to the unique size of that city, none other matching it throughout the world.

Verse 8



Verse 9

לך נא אל הצאן, take time out from your usual pursuits [in the tents] and go to the pens where the sheep and goats are kept.
גדיי עזים, on account of their skins whose hair is hard like human hair. This is why he took goats instead of lambs.


Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

ימושני אבי, the word is derived from the expression ממשמש בצהרים in Deuteronomy 28,29 describing people unable to find their way around at high noon, in spite of the sunshine, and having to feel their way about, using their hands in order not to stumble and fall. It is also similar in meaning to the word יסובבהו ערבי נחל in Job 40,22 where it describes the foliage of the reeds forming a protective cover..

Verse 13

עלי קללתך, upon me and my neck; she was relying on the prophecy she had received during her pregnancy that the older son would serve the younger one (25,23)

Verse 14



Verse 15

החמודות, the ones his father would use when he ate his meals.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

ואכלה מצידי, the letter א has a chataf kametz abbreviated kametz, underneath it as the word is in an imperative mode. We have a parallel mode in Kohelet 9,7 אכול בשמחה לחמך, “eat your food joyfully,” the letter א having an abbreviated vowel segol for the same reason. On the other hand, the word ואוכלה in ואוכלה מציד בני in verse 25 of this chapter has the vowel cholem, as it is in a future mode. Just as the word זכור in זכור ה' לדוד, ”O Lord, remember in David’s favour” is in an imperative mode, and the words זכרה לחסדי דוד, “remember the loyalty of Your servant David” in Chronicles II 6,42 are in an imperative mode, so the word אכלה here is also in the imperative mode.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

הקול קול יעקב, seeing that Esau and Yaakov were twins, their voices were similar to one another. This made it easy for Yitzchok to err as to who was in front of him if he were to rely only on his sense of hearing. Having first established that unlike Yaakov who was smooth skinned, the son in front of him was hairy, Yitzchok was now faced with a dilemma whether to trust his sense of hearing or his sense of touch.

Verse 23



Verse 24

אתה זה בני עשו, it would appear that you are my son Esau.

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27

ריח בגדיו, the costly ones. The clothing worn by people in those days were scented with incense.
'אשר ברכו ה, a reference the word שדה, to the field which has been blessed by G’d. This is also how Rabbi Eliezer Hakalir understood it in his liturgical poem where he wrote שדה מבורך כהריח ברכו במתן טל. [the poem starts with the words אאגרה בני, this is part of the full length Tal prayer printed in the German Machzorim as well as in the older editions of Machzorim featuring the whole range of the Piyutim. Yaakov is described there as smelling as fragrantly as a field blessed with dew. Ed.]

Verse 28

ויתן לך, these words are a continuation of the words אשר ברכו ה' which precede them. They describe the type of blessing G’d will provide for Yaakov (Esau). מטל השמים, essentially what is known as the “blessing of the field.”

Verse 29

בני אמך, here the word וישתחו appears in the singular, whereas in a parallel blessing pronounced by Yaakov who had several wives (Genesis 49,8) the word וישתחוו appears in the plural.

Verse 30

ויהי אך יצא יצא, this detail has been recorded to illustrate the miracles which were performed in order to enable Yaakov to obtain this blessing. If Esau had returned just one minute sooner, Yaakov would not have secured this blessing.

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

ויחרד יצחק, he was upset at having found hair on the smooth part of Yaakov’s neck.
מי איפוא, this is a turn of phrase, as is the word איזו in the Talmud Baba Metzia70 אימא לי איזו, “tell me my dear friend.”
גם בראך יהיה. “Because he carried out my request so promptly.” Also, Yitzchok was aware that Yaakov had done what he did at the advice and request of Rivkah. Clearly, he reasoned, Rivkah had realised that Yaakov was entitled to this blessing.


Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36

?הכי קרא שמו יעקב, the line is a rhetorical question. Esau says: “although Yaakov had been named thus because at birth he had held on to my heel so that I became the firstborn and entitled to a double inheritance and he was without such distinction, is he now going to turn the tables on me and get the share of the firstborn, i.e. both blessings?” The word הכי as a question also occurs in connection with Lavan and Yaakov when the latter works for his uncle. When the question of wages came up, Lavan exclaimed הכי אחי אתה ועבדתני חינם, “would there be any justice in your working for me without wages merely because you are my brother (and one does not have to pay one’s family)?” (29,15) Lavan implied: “on the contrary, you should be paid more generously because you are my family.” We have learned in Baba Batra 139 that when someone dies leaving behind many children (sons) and the estate is substantial, the sons share the inheritance whereas the daughters receive a stipend from the estate pending their getting married. When the estate the father left behind is meager, the daughters get the stipend whereas the sons will have to fend for themselves even if it involves begging. Admon says וכי בשביל שאני זכר ויפה כח בנכסים מרובים הורע כוחי בנכסים מועטין? “Am I supposed to suffer because I am male, able-bodied and my parents were wealthy?” [his argument was accepted by Rabban Gamliel, as was every other argument quoted in the name of Admon in the Talmud. Ed.]

Verse 37

נתתי לו לעבדים, whatever a slave purchases automatically becomes the property of his master.

Verse 38



Verse 39



Verse 40

ועל חרבחך תחיה, a reference to Esau’s vocation as a hunter, promising him success with his hunting tools.
וכאשר תריד, the word is used in the same sense as in Psalms 55,3 אריד בשיחי, “my conversation is full of agitation,” (as a result of feeling oppressed) i.e. “if your brother will subjugate you too harshly so that you cannot endure it, “ ופרקת עלו, “you will shake off his yoke.”


Verse 41



Verse 42



Verse 43



Verse 44



Verse 45

גם שניכם, if he will kill you he in turn will be executed by the blood avengers.

Verse 46

IF YA'AKOV MARRIES.  Rivka said this to Yitzhak cleverly, to separate Ya'akov from Eisav, but she did not reveal to him that it was because of his [Ya'akov's] brother's hatred that she did this.

Chapter 28



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

לרשתך את הארץ, seeing that you cannot take a wife from the daughters of the Canaanites as Avraham had commanded Yitzchok because they are slaves, (cursed.)

Verse 5



Verse 6

וירא עשו כי ברך יצחק את יעקב, Esau realised that in the blessings which Yitzchok had given Yaakov the land of Canaan as his heritage had been included, and that Yitzchok also had given Yaakov specific instructions to get a wife from amongst the daughters of Lavan, the brother of his mother, and on no account to marry a local Canaanite girl. Esau therefore arrived at the conclusion that he had been deprived of his share in the land of Canaan as a penalty for having married Canaanite girls and that this was the reason why Yaakov had been successful in stealing the blessing of Avraham from him. He therefore decided to marry into Avraham’s family, i.e. a descendant of Ishmael. He thought to himself that perhaps by doing this he would restore his claim to Avraham’s heritage.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

אחות נביות, seeing that Nevayot was the oldest of Ishmael’s children the Torah calls Machalat “the sister of Nevayot,” (instead of merely “the daughter of Ishmael”). We find something parallel to this in Exodus 15,20 ותקח מרים הנביאה אחות אהרן, “Miriam the prophetess, sister of Aaron, took, etc.” The reason she is referred to in that fashion is that she was older than Moses but younger than Aaron. On the other hand, in a verse where both Moses and Aaron are mentioned together with Miriam, (Exodus Numbers 26,59) she is referred to as “their sister.” The Torah employs the same formulation in Genesis 36,22 where Timna is described as the sister of Lotan, seeing that Lotan was the oldest of his brothers as we know from verse 20 in that chapter, i.e. לוטן, ושובל, וצבעון, וענה.

Verse 10

 וילך חרנה, in order to go to Charan.

Verse 11

ויפגע במקום, on his way he had an encounter in or near a town known as Luz.
כי בא השמש, and there had not been time enough for him to enter the town and find lodging while it was still daylight, as Rabbi Yehudah (Pessachim 2) says a person setting out on a lengthy journey should always select Tuesday as the day of his departure. [the relevance of this statement is provided by Rashi on that folio who adds that the traveler has to look for lodging before the sun sets. Ed.]
 ויקח מאבני המקום, he took one...
... of the stones lying around in that location, as testified to in verse 18 when the Torah speaks of את האבן, “the  stone.”


Verse 12

מוצב, which had been erected by others. When the Torah later speaks about ה' נצב in verse 13, the meaning is that He supported Himself, had not been placed there, [although the letter נ at the beginning of that word suggested a passive mode. Ed.] We encounter similar formulations with the words מוקטר offered as incense by others, or מוגש, presented by others in Maleachi 1,11 whereas the words נגש אל הערפל in Exodus 20,21 mean that Moses approached the cloud under his own initiative. Also the expression אשר אתה מראה בהר (with the vowel kametz under the letter א) is also referring to someone else showing Moses the image. (Exodus 25,40) On the other hand, the expression נראה in Genesis 12,7 refers to a vision generated by G’d Himself.
עולים ויורדים, according to the plain meaning of the text there is no need to read any special message into the word עולים, “climbing,” appearing before the word יורדים, “descending.”


Verse 13

הארץ אשר אתה שוכב עליה לך אתננה ולזרעך, if you were to say that this promise entails so very little, I am adding that your descendants will spread out in all directions of the globe.

Verse 14

ונברכו, an expression meaning “refining and improving thereby.” It means that these nations will be improved through intermarriage with your family. 
כל משפחות האדמה. The word is in a passive, weak mode as I have already explained on the same phrasing in Genesis 12,3


Verse 15

כי לא אעזבך, on the journeys,
עד אשר עשיתי את אשר דברתי עליך. to bring you back to this part of the earth, for while you are journeying, traveling, you are in need of special protection of My angels, as we know from Psalms 91,11 כי מלאכיו יצוה לך לשמרך בכל דרכיך, “for He will command His angels to protect you on all your travels.”


Verse 16

אכן יש ה' במקום הזה, contrary to what I thought when I lay down here that this is a totally secular place, devoid of sanctity. Every time the expression אכן occurs in Scripture it means that the person exclaiming it had to revise an opinion previously held. A well-known example is Exodus 2,14אכן נודע הדבר, when Moses made the devastating discovery that his having slain the Egyptian had not remained a secret.

Verse 17



Verse 18

ויצק שמו על ראשה, he anointed it to sanctify it and to make it ready to offer sacrifices on it when he would return to that site. We have such formulations in connection with the sanctification of the various materials donated for the Tabernacle (Numbers 7,1) as well as in Genesis 31,13  and again in verse 22 in our chapter here.

Verse 19

ואולם, but, לוז שם העיר, the Torah refers to the site where Yaakov had slept by the same name as the town nearby.


Verse 20



Verse 21

ושבתי בשלום, in accordance with G’d’s promise in verse 15.
והיה ה' לי לאלוקים, to assist me in all my undertakings. 


Verse 22

 עשר אעשרנו לו, to present to Him a burnt offering.

Chapter 29



Verse 1

וישא יעקב רגליו, seeing that he had received assurances from G’d during his nocturnal dream, he now proceeded encouraged, joyfully, something that the Torah describes with the words “he lifted up his feet.”
בני קדם, inhabitants of Aram, as we know from Isaiah 9,11.


Verse 2

רבצים עליה, waiting until all the shepherds would gather there with their flocks and they would roll the rock off the top of the well.
והאבן גדולה על פי הבאר, this was a precautionary measure to ensure people would not fall into the well and drown, or that they would not draw water from the well if not entitled to this.


Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

Verse 10

ויגל את האבן, to inform you of his strength.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

את הדברים האלה. that his father and mother had sent him to the members of his family.

Verse 14

אך עצמי ובשרי, you have therefore done well in coming to me.

Verse 15



Verse 16

וללבן שתי בנות, the Torah interrupted Yaakov’s narrative by telling us that seeing that Lavan had only two daughters and the younger one appealed to Yaakov, he asked her father for her hand in marriage.

Verse 17

רכות, beautiful; our sages in Taanit 24 say that when a prospective bride has beautiful eyes, the bridegroom need not have the rest of her body checked out for possible blemishes. Black eyes are not considered as beautiful as white ones. [I suppose the reference is to blue ones. Ed.]
יפה תאר, as in Isaiah 44,13 במחוגה יתארהו, “he marks out a form with a stylus.” This is a reference to the shape of her nose, forehead, lips and cheeks.
יפה מראה, healthy looking skin.


Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

 כי מלאו ימי, “I have served you for seven years.”

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

והנה היא לאה, whenever something had not been known or recognised previously the word הנה alerts the reader to this fact. (compare Genesis 41,7 והנה חלום, “it was a dream.”) Until Pharaoh awoke he had taken what he saw in the dream as being real.

Verse 26



Verse 27

מלא שבוע זאת, a reference to the seven days of the wedding festivities for Leah.
ונתנה, she will be given to you;
(3) THIS ONE TOO.  Immediately.  
בעבודה אשר תעבוד עמדי , after having wed Rachel. We can confirm this seeing that when Joseph was born, at the end of these seven years, Yaakov wanted to take his leave and to return to his parents.(compare 30,25 “for I have served you for your two daughters”).

(5) ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS.  As it is written (Gen. 30:25), "After Rahel had borne Yosef, Ya'akov said to Lavan, 'Give me leave etc.,'" for it was at that point that he had completed the 14 years for his [Lavan's] two daughters.

Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

ויאהב גם את רחל, he not only slept also with her, but also loved her more than he loved Leah. On most occasions in Scripture when the word גם appears in an inverted fashion, such as here, the meaning is similar. In Exodus 12,32 when Pharaoh said to Moses וברכתם גם אותי, the meaning is: “also bless me.” In Numbers 22,33 when the angel said to Bileam: גם אותך הרגתי, he meant: “I would also have killed you, seeing that I first squeezed your foot and you are already lame. Now I would have killed you if not for your ass lying down.”

Verse 31

ורחל עקרה, she was punished for having said to Yaakov: “get me children!” (30,1)

Verse 32

יאהבני, the vowel patach under the letter ב is equivalent to the letter having been vocalised with a tzeyreh. We have a similar construction in Isaiah 56,3 where the word  yavdilani means the same as if the prophet had written yavdileyni.

Verse 33



Verse 34

על כן קרא שמו לוי, one may assume that it was Yaakov who gave the boy this name. (compare Kimchi)

Chapter 30



Verse 1

מתה אנכי, in this verse when the word מתה is in the present tense, the stress is on the last syllable, whereas in Genesis 48,7 where the same word occurs in the past tense, the stress is on the first syllable. 

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

נפתולי אלוקים נפתלתי, this formulation is partly due to literary considerations, so that the letter נ at the beginning of the word נפתולי is due primarily in order to match the latter נ in the word נפתלתי. We encounter something similar is the construction of Samuel I 20,28 נשאל נשאל דוד, 

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

בא גד, “we have been granted good fortune.” We find the word גד used in a similar sense in Isaiah 65,11 העורכים לגד שלחן, “Who set a table for Luck.” Also the Talmud Shabbat 67 גד גדי וסינוק לא, “be lucky and do not suffer from fatigue,” uses the word גד in this sense. Anyone who translates the word as derived from גדוד, related to a troop, is in error. Even though names usually reflect a popular manner of speaking, such as ראובן being related to ראה, saw, (compare 29,32) or שמעון as related to שמע, (29,33) unless Leah had mentioned the word גדוד when naming this son we would not be able to trace the word גד as an abbreviation of גדוד, (using the letter ד twice) justifying such a comparison. The expression יגודו על נפש צדיק in Psalms 94,21 “they band together to do away with the righteous,” where it does stem from the word גדוד, does so because of the dagesh in the second ד.replaces the missing second ד. We find a parallel construction in Psalms 106,43 וימכו בעונם, where the dagesh in the letter כ of the word וימוכו substitutes for the missing second letter כ of the root מכך. Job 30,12 and 16,13 also have similar constructions where a dagesh substitutes for a missing root letter.


Verse 12



Verse 13

באשרי, I am glowing in the praises and good wishes bestowed on me by the other women.

Verse 14

דודאים, flowers of the fig tree; (compare Jeremiah 24,1) In Song of Songs 7,14 these flowers are described as rich in fragrance.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

יששכר, a double reward, one for handing over the dudaim; the other, that I gave my handmaid to my husband to have children with.

Verse 19



Verse 20

זבד, an expression denoting a generous portion of something, depending on the context in which the word is used.
(2) WILL EXALT ME.  As in (I Kings 8:13), "I have now built for You a stately House," an expression of residence.

Verse 21

ותקרא את שמה דינה. No mention is made of Leah giving thanks to the Lord for giving birth to a daughter, seeing that one does not express gratitude for bearing a daughter in the same degree as one does for bearing a son. The reason that the birth of this daughter is mentioned is to inform us that with the exception of this one girl Yaakov’s children were all males. The same thing is true of the daughter of Asher, Serach being mentioned; (46,17) among all the 70 Israelites descending to Egypt only two were females.

Verse 22



Verse 23

אסף אלוקים, the word is to be understood as similar to Deuteronomy 22,20 ואספת אל תוך ביתך, or Jerermiah 16,5 כי אספתי שלומי, the hiding and covering up (inside) of something. In this case, Rachel’s shame at being perceived as being barren could now be hidden.

Verse 24

ותקרא את שמו יוסף. An allusion to G’d having removed her shame, אסף את חרפתי. If this is correct, she should have called him אסף; why did she add the letter י?  This is because she had prayed for another son, saying יוסף ה' לי בו אחר. We find therefore that the name she gave this child symbolises two thoughts of its mother both of which she had already articulated.

Verse 25

שלחני, for now that Joseph had been born Yaakov’s second stint of 7 years labour for Lavan had come to an end.

Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

לרגלי, “on my behalf.” The word רגל in this connection also occurs in 33,14 לרגל המלאכה אשר לפני, “on account of the livestock before me.”

Verse 31

לא תתן לי מאומה, of all the sheep and goats you have now, seeing that I have served you for your two daughters during the period you acquired them. However, from the flocks which I will tend for you from this day on, you will give me the ones which will be born spotted or speckled, after you have first removed all those that are spotted and speckled now, and given them to your sons to look after. I want you to completely separate them from the flocks I look after. Those animals which will be born with the skin pattern I have selected, genetically not related to former generations of your animals with the same skin pattern, will be my wages.

Verse 32

נקוד, I believe that this describes these spots in the region of the neck and head, as the word ויקוד means bending down with one’s head and neck. (Exodus 34,8) The word ויקוד has a dagesh in the letter ק, as on that occasion Moses’ bowing down was equivalent to his prostrating himself, i.e. more than just bowing down. The word is of the category of נפל, which in a similar construction would also be ויפול with the dagesh inn the letter פ. The קדקד is the head, but is also connected to the foot, as the line ויעקוד את יצחק means that he bound Yitzchok’s feet. (Genesis 22,9).
הסר משם, in your own interest.
והיה שכרי, it will become my wages, from now on.

Verse 33

וענתה בי צדקתי, both today and in the future.
לפניך, when you will come to check my wages, that it will not contain animals with a different skin pattern from what we agreed.
חום בכבשים, but not among the goats, seeing most goats are brown.


Verse 34



Verse 35

 ויתן ביד בניו, of Lavan.

Verse 36

ובין יעקב, Lavan’s flocks which Yaakov tended were 3 days distant from the spotted and speckled ones which Lavan had first removed from the original flocks.

Verse 37

מקל לבנה, the reason why the letter ק in the word מקל has the vowel patach instead of the vowel tzeyreh, as we might have expected, is because it is in a construct form to the word לבנה, the tree that this staff was cut from. We encounter a similar construction for the same reason in Leviticus 27,32 where the Torah speaks of Ma-assar bakar instead of ma-asser bakar, “tithe of the cattle.” The word מעשר is in a construct form to the word בקר.  We find a similar construction in Jeremiah 6,26 with the expressionמספד תמרורים, as well as in Amos 5,16 and Numbers 18,26 and Numbers 22,27.
לח, not literally, wet, but not dried out.
מחשוף, exposed, visible. Compare the same expression in Ezekiel 4,7, or in Isaiah 52,10 חשף ה' את זרוע קדשו, “the Lord bared His holy arm.” 

Verse 38

ויחמנה, the word has a similar construction as Samuel I 6,12 וישרנה הפרות, “the cows went straight ahead,” where a feminine mode and a masculine mode is combined. [the letter י at the beginning of the word signaling a masculine mode, and the letters נה at the end signaling a feminine mode. Ed.] Similar unusual constructions are found in Daniel 8,22 ארבע מלכיות מגוי יעמדנה, or Ezekiel 37,7 ותקרבו העצמות עצם אל עצמו. In all of these examples the verb is in a partially masculine and partially feminine mode.

Verse 39

 ויחמו הצאן, this is a masculine construction.

Verse 40

והכבשים הפריד יעקב, the spotted and striped ones Yaakov had already previously removed from Lavan’s flocks during the first and second year. He now let Lavan’s spotted and striped sheep see the females of the young ones to encourage them to become pregnant with newly born lambs of the skin pattern which they had recently seen while in a state of stimulation. In order to reinforce the imagination of the sheep to be impregnated, he planted the sticks with the peeled parts near the troughs to enhance the chances of the next crop of lambs to display the skin patterns he hoped for.

Verse 41

המקושרות, during the month of Tishrey.

Verse 42

ובהעטיף, during the interval between giving birth for the first time and the ability to conceive again had begun, Yaakov did not bother using the stratagem of the peeled sticks when the sheep would be watered.

Chapter 31



Verse 1

הכבוד, the weight and power of the money. We have already encountered the word כבד as an adjective describing the wealth in Genesis 13,2.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

ואלוקי אבי היה עמדי, even though Lavan’s attitude to me was hostile. I did not steal anything from him, but G’d was with me and He gave it to me.

Verse 6



Verse 7

מונים, as if the Torah had written מנינים, ten times.
עשרת, the number is not to be taken literally, just as in Leviticus 26,26 the line עשר נשים לחמכם, ואפוdoes not literally mean that ten women would bake their bread in a single oven; rather, seeing that they have so little flour it is a symbol for “many.” The same word “ten” is used as an exaggeration in Job 19,3.


Verse 8

וילדו כל הצאן, this percentage could certainly not all be attributed to exposing the sheep to the peeled sticks.

Verse 9

ויצל, He separated. Any word in the Hebrew language denoting salvation, involves setting someone apart from others who share doom.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

אשר משחת, in order to sanctify it; so far you have not offered a sacrifice on it that would discharge your vow.

Verse 14



Verse 15

כספינו, which he had earned in payment for marrying us off. He even ate up the money you earned with your hard labour which was meant to support us.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

ותגנוב רחל את התרפים, in order that Lavan should not be able to locate the whereabouts of Yaakov and his family. We know from Hoseah 3,4 that Teraphim were credited with supplying such information to people believing in their power. Zecharyah 10,2 also refers to them as speaking, though deceptively. At any rate, they were widely consulted to provide information about the future, information of a supernatural dimension.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

דרך שבעת ימים. Yaakov was forced to travel very slowly on account of his herds and flocks, so that although he traveled away from Lavan who had been three days’; journey away from him at the start, he could catch up with him within one week. Clearly, Lavan rode after Yaakov at full speed.

Verse 24

Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

ואלקי אביכם, for I respect Him.

Verse 30



Verse 31

כי יראתי...עם אשר תמצא, Yaakov answered Lavan’s first accusation first, and the second one afterwards.

Verse 32

לא יחיה, meaning that Yaakov himself will avenge such a crime from its perpetrator.

Verse 33

ויבא לבן באהל יעקב ואחר כך באהל לאה ואחר כך באהל רחל. He entered all the various tents of the wives separately. The reason Lavan did not find the Teraphim in Rachel‘s tent was that as soon as he left Leah’s tent Rachel put the Teraphim beneath the saddle of the camel that she sat upon.
ויצא מאהל לאה ויבא באהל רחל, even though according to what has been written earlier he went to the tent of Leah and the tent of the two maidservants, this was not quite the sequence in which Lavan searched. He had entered Rachel’s tent upon leaving Leah’s tent, before having searched the tents of the servant maids. The Torah abbreviated the narrative somewhat as it was tediously long.


Verse 34

בכר, a kind of cushion one places on the back of a camel to sit upon.

Verse 35



Verse 36



Verse 37



Verse 38

לא שכלו, neither because of any lack of adequate grazing nor due to careless supervision
ואילי צאנך, it is customary that the shepherds eat the meat of male sheep they tend.


Verse 39

אחטפנה, the meaning is that Yaakov would have to pay for the loss from his own pocket. A similar construction occurs in Kings I 1,21. where the line אני ובני שלמה חטאים does not mean “I and my son Shlomoh will be guilty,” but I and my son Shlomoh will have to bear the cost.
גנבתי יום, the letter י appears to be superfluous; Yaakov states that he had to make good both for animals stolen by day and any stolen by night. The construction is similar to Lamentations 1,1 רבתי עם שרתי במדינות. The word גנובתי with the vowel kametz under the letter ב would mean “the stolen one would be considered as if it had been mine.” 


Verse 40



Verse 41



Verse 42

שלחתני, and not with joy and songs.

Verse 43

  מה אעשה, how can I possibly harm them?

Verse 44



Verse 45



Verse 46



Verse 47



Verse 48



Verse 49

והמצפה, this lookout is referred to in Judges 11,29.
יצף, from that location. Compare Ezekiel 3,17 where the word צופה is a noun, “sentinel.” The relative construction between יצף and צופה is parallel to Genesis 1,22 ירב בארץ and פרה ורבה in Genesis 35,11.


Verse 50



Verse 51

יריתי, “I erected.” Yaakov erected it at the suggestion of Lavan. The verb ירה occurs in a similar meaning in Exodus 15,4 ירה בים. [a very unusual translation. Ed.]

Chapter 32



Verse 1



Verse 2

ויפגעו בו, in order to protect him, as in 28,15 “and here I will be with you.”


Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

ויצו אותם לאמור, he commanded them and said to them: כה תאמרון, the messengers were oblivious of what it was that troubled Yaakov.
עם לבן גרתי, as you are aware of, I was there at the command of my father and mother. He said this so Esau would not think that he had run away on his account.
ואחר, the construction is similar to ואאחר, or as in Maleachi 1,2 ואוהב את יעקב “I displayed love for Yaakov.” In both instances this is an abbreviation for ואאהב. We have similar constructions in vaochal, vaomar, in both instances the first root letter is missing.


Verse 6



Verse 7

באנו אל אחיך אל עשו, and you have found favour in his eyes, just as you said you would;
 out of the joy at the impending reunion he approaches to meet with four hundred men, all in your honour. This, basically, is the plain meaning of the verse. This is also the plain meaning of Exodus 4,14 where the Torah describes Aaron coming to meet his brother Moses whom he had not seen for many years, and the Torah adds that he is overjoyed at the prospect.

Verse 8

ויירא יעקב, in his heart; Although he had pretended to his messengers that Esau approached with a large delegation in order to honour him, he did not believe this himself, but he was convinced that Esau’s intentions were hostile.
ויצר, a word derived from the same root as Numbers 25,17 צרור את המדינים, “harass the Midianites.” The construction is not unlike that of the word ותקל in Genesis 16,4 which describes Hagar’s attitude to her mistress after she had become pregnant by Avraham. The word there is derived from the root קלל. 
ויחץ, from the root חצה, to divide into half. We find this word in this sense in Numbers 31,42 describing Moses as having divided the booty from the Midianites into two halves.


Verse 9

לפלטה. The two camps were positioned quite a distance one from the other, so that if it would become obvious that disaster struck one camp the other would have a chance to flee.
המחנה האחת, a feminine mode, as occurs also in Psalms 27,3 אם תחנה עלי מחנה, “should an army besiege me.”
הנשאר, now we have the masculine mode. This is one of many instances in which a noun appears sometimes in the masculine mode and sometimes in the feminine mode. Well known examples are Genesis 19,23 השמש יצא על הארץ (where the word שמש is treated as masculine), and Jonah 4,8 ' where it is treated as feminine, i.e. ותך השמש. (whereas in the beginning of the same verse it is treated as masculine, i.e. ויזרח). Compare also Psalms 148,8 and Job 1,19.


Verse 10

אלוקי אבי אברהם ואלוקי אבי יצחק, Who has made me promises using these words to identify Himself to me when I had departed from Beer Sheva. (28,13.)

Verse 11

קטנתי מכל, from qualifying for all the
החסדים, the loving kindness as expressed by promises. We have a parallel to this in Kings I 8,64. Seeing that You have performed for me both חסדים and אמת, although I have not yet redeemed my vow to establish an altar at Beyt El and to sacrifice to You there, I am now afraid in spite of the assurances You have given me. I am aware that You do not judge man according to his good intentions but according to his carrying out such intentions, and I have been remiss in this respect. We find in connection with Chizkiyah, King of Yehudah in Kings I 20,1 that when the prophet had told him: “you will die and not live,” that the king prayed to G’d and was granted an additional 15 years of life on earth. [he was given this extension as in his prayer he had enumerated his merits, although G’d justified the extension with reference to King David, Chizkiyah’s ancestor. Ed.]


Verse 12

פן יבא והכני, because I am not worthy of all the loving kindness G’d has already shown me, (as I explained on verse 10)

Verse 13

ואתה אמרת היטב איטיב עמך; even though You are under no obligation to keep the promise You have made to me seeing that I am not worthy of it, do it for the sake of Your Holy Name which obligates You to keep Your promises (as Moses argued when he reasoned with You not to destroy Israel in spite of their having sinned with the golden calf. His argument had been: “Why should the impression be created that You are unable to keep promises You have made?”) The argument used by Moses he used more than once when he repeated it after the sin of the spies (Numbers 14,16)

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

ובניהם, according to the plain meaning the males which the camels were suckling. When there are both females and males, the Torah does not mention the females separately.

Verse 17

וריוח תשימו, a device to make each gift appear as a sign of Yaakov’s respect. When someone receives a number of gifts at intervals he appreciates them all the more.

Verse 18

למי אתה, the word עבד is implied, i.e. Esau would ask: “whose servant are you?”

Verse 19

מנחה, we explained this term in connection with Genesis 4,3.

Verse 20



Verse 21

כי אמר אכפרה פניו, this is not what Yaakov said but what he thought in his heart. This line does not belong to the instructions he had given to his emisssaries.
וגם הנה הוא אחרינו, actually Yaakov had intended to flee in a different direction during the night if the angel had not delayed him. At the time he issued the instructions to his emissaries this had been intended as a stratagem to make Esau think that he was following on the heels of his gift whereas in fact he was not.


Verse 22



Verse 23

ויקם בלילה ההוא , he crossed the river at night because he intended to change direction to avoid a meeting with Esau. We find that David did something similar when he was fleeing from his son Avshalom at the same location of Machanyim as reported in Samuel II 17,21-24. At that time, coming from the direction of Jerusalem, David crossed the river Jordan, a more formidable river than the Yabbok, a mere tributary of the Jordan which could be crossed relatively easily. [flight by crossing a river, eliminating footprints and wading along the bank before crossing to the other side slows down the pursuers who first have to find in which direction the fugitive continued. Ed.].

Verse 24



Verse 25

ויותר יעקב לבדו, after he had transferred all his belongings to the other side of the river, so that the only one still to be brought across was he himself. The reason that he wanted to cross only after everyone else had already crossed was that he intended to flee in a different direction so as to avoid a face to face encounter with Esau.
ויאבק, an angel engaged him in a physical fight, his purpose being to prevent Yaakov from fleeing. Only in this way could G’d’s promise to Yaakov that Esau would not harm him be fulfilled.


Verse 26

כי לא יכול לו, the angel did not succeed in preventing Yaakov from crossing and fleeing.
ותקע, was dislocated, separated. We find the word as having a similar meaning in Jeremiah 6,8 פן תקע נפשי ממך; “lest My essence not become separated from you (Israel).” Whereas in the words ירך the emphasis is on the first syllable, in verse 33 in the word הירך the emphasis is on the letter ר, seeing that there it is used as a noun, whereas here it appears in an adjective mode. Whenever ירך appears in a construct form (Exodus 40,24, i.e. as something subordinate, its stress is on the first syllable) Also the kametz changes to a segol, as the word in unadorned mode is yarech and not yerech. [the author quotes parallels from the word gezel and gazel, respectively, claiming that the unadorned  noun for robbery is gazel not gezel. He makes the same claim for the words geder and gader (fence) respectively. [In modern Hebrew the latter is accepted whereas “robbery,” גזל, does not appear with a kametz, but the difference between the construct mode and the unadorned noun is merely that the latter has a chataf segol instead of a regular vowel segol. Ed.]


Verse 27

כי עלה השחר, seeing that it is daylight already it is time for you to be on your way. (to the meeting with Esau).
כי אם ברכתני, as a sign that you have parted from me in peace, that I will not suffer harm or damage through having been in a struggle with you.. Now that it had become daylight Yaakov realised for the first time that his adversary had been an angel.


Verse 28



Verse 29

כי שרית, the word is derived from שרה in Hoseah 12,4 ובאונו שרה את אלוקים, “and with his might he fought with a Divine Being (reference to Yaakov).” The construction is parallel to קנה-קנית, or עשה-עשית. However, in the same chapter, verse 5 in Hoseah, the word וישר in the line וישר אל מלאך ויוכל, “he wrestled with an angel and prevailed,” is not derived from the root שרה but is of the same category of verbs as קם, שב, רץ all of which have a letter ו in the middle in the infinitive. The corresponding construction to ours of those examples would be ויקם, ויקב, וירץ, as in וישר from the root שור, ”to wrestle.” As to the fact that in spite of his victory, Yaakov was injured in that struggle, this was a punishment for his attempt to flee, in spite of his having been assured by G’d that He would help and protect him. We find other examples of great people who pursue a path that does not conform with G’d’s will that as a result they experience punishment for ignoring G’d’s will. As soon as Moses refused the mission and told G’d to send someone else, (Exodus 4,13) we find that G’d became angry at him. According to the plain meaning of the text there, although the sages say that wherever G’d’s anger is mentioned the subject at whom G’d is angry is visibly punished, whereas there is no word about Moses being punished for his words שלח נא ביד תשלח, Aaron who was meant to function only as a Levite, became the High Priest, a role which Moses would have filled but for his improper refusal to accept G’d’s mission without demurring. This is an explanation based on an allegorical approach, whereas the plain meaning is that at the inn, when on his way to Egypt, Moses was almost killed for having been remiss in not circumcising his son Eliezer before setting out on his journey. Jonah, too was punished for trying to circumvent the will of G’d and spent three most uncomfortable days inside one or more fish. Similarly, G’d’s anger resulted in Bileam being harmed by his ass when contravening G’d’s will and setting out on his way to curse the Jewish people  (Numbers 22,22 indicates that he walked with a pronounced limp, presumably due to having his leg squeezed against the wall by his ass as per Numbers 22,25.


Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

והוא צולע על ירכו, now that the sun was shining he realised that he was walking with a limp, a belated discovery, just as when he discovered that he had spent a night in bed with Leah thinking that she was Rachel (29,25).

Verse 33

על כן לא יאכלו, as a reminder of the heroism displayed by Yaakov, as well as a reminder of the miracle that G’d performed for him as a result of which he did not die.

Verse 7

נגש יוסף ורחל, normally, the males are mentioned before the females. The reason why Yaakov changed that routine was so that the mothers could precede their children with the exception of Joseph and Rachel. The only reason why in verse 2 Rachel is mentioned ahead of Joseph, is because Leah was mentioned ahead of her children as were the other mothers of Yaakov’s children.

Verse 8

?מי לך כל המחנה הזה, a reference to the herds of animals Yaakov had sent.

Verse 18

ויבא יעקב שלם, to the city named Shalem. The construction is similar to ותבאנה בית לחם, “they arrived at Bet Lechem.” (Ruth 1,19)
עיר שכם, the city of Shechem (who subsequently raped Dinah) The description parallels Numbers 21,26 where Cheshbon is described as the city of Sichon, King of the Emorites. Anyone who explains Shechem as being the name of the city errs. We do not find anywhere that a city is described in such terms, i.e. as עיר ציון, or as עיר ירושלים. Invariably such cities are described with the appropriate definitive article ה i.e. as the word העיר following the name of the city in question. Even assuming that the city under discussion was Shechem, the town may have been renamed in commemoration of the heroism displayed by the sons of Yaakov. We know that the town Luz was renamed Bet El by Yaakov. (28,19) We find the same construction in Joshua 19,7 when the Danites renamed a city “Dan” to honour their tribal father and the acts of heroism by the soldiers of the tribe in capturing the city. Already the first builder of a city, Kayin, is described in Genesis 4,14 as ויקרא שם העיר כשם בנו חנוך, “he named the city in accordance with the name of his son Enoch.” Even the sages of the Midrash who understand the word שלם as an attribute, adjective, describing Yaakov at that point as “whole” in body, spirit, and material wealth, did not catch the plain meaning of the text if that was their intention. It is simply not the style of the Scriptures to express itself in such terms. There is no need for this. Did the Torah have to tell us that Yaakov’s wealth was not impaired as a result of the lavish gift he sent to Esau? 

Verse 19

 קשיטה, a coin by that name.

Verse 20

א-ל אלו-הי ישראל, Who has saved me from Lavan as well as from Esau. The wording means that the same G’d Who had been the G’d of someone called Yaakov, continued in His role as the G’d of Yisrael. Just as people who are called Eliezer (G’s is my help) are also called Immanuel, seeing that the meaning is identical, so also the comparison between the G’d of Yaakov and the G’d of Yisrael. I believe this is the plain meaning of our verse.

Chapter 34



Verse 1

ותצא דינה, because Yaakov had pitched his tent outside the city limits of Shechem. She left that compound to enter the town.

Verse 9

בנותיכם תתנו ואת בנותינו תקחו לכם, the sons of Yaakov, on their part made intermarriage something that was in their honour, “i.e. to give and to take.” When Shechem and Chamor presented this proposal to their townspeople they reversed it to make it appear as if they were the ones bestowing honour, when they said: “we will take and we will give.” (verse 31) They did this in order to seduce their townsfolk to submit to circumcision.

Verse 10

וסחרוה, the letter ח in this word is the reason why the Torah did not need to write the word בה, i.e. תסחרו בה, “you may trade feely in it.” The vowel kametz under the letter ח instead of the semi vowel sheva we would have expected is what saved the Torah the word, or rather the extra letter ב by adding the word בה to the word וסחרו. 

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

Verse 16

ונתנו, with a dagesh in the second letter נ to double it. The meaning is the same as the regular future ניתן “we will give.” A similar construction of this verb is found in Lamentations 5,6 מצרים נתנו יד, meaning the same as נתננו, “we hold out a hand to Egypt.”

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

בהיותם כואבים, according to normal reactions of people to such an operation, and according to the plain meaning of the text, the meaning is that they had been in pain during the first and second day after the circumcision, and they were now in even greater pain, 
ויבואו על העיר, the people there felt perfectly safe, so that Shimon and Levi did not need to take any precautions. Whenever the word בטח occurs throughout Scriptures, it refers to the people feeling secure, unworried, just as in this verse.

ויקרא למקום, which was outside Luz, where he had erected a monument 34 years earlier when he was on his way from his home El Bet El.
 Originally, he had called the town known as Luz merely Bet El. Now he named the site where he had had the dream with the ladder El Bet El. This site was outside the town previously known as Luz. He added the word El, seeing that during all the intervening years G’d had stood by him.

Verse 8

אלון בכות, this is mentioned only because all the locations at which Yaakov stopped on his return from Lavan and which were mentioned in the Torah were mentioned because of something that happened there. They were: Pnuel, Sukkot, El Elo-hey Yisrael, Shalem, the city of Shechem. Luz(ah), El Bet El, Alon Bachut, the second Bet El, Bet Lechem (Efrat), Migdal Eder.

Verse 14



Verse 15

המקום אשר דבר אתו. This precise expression has been repeated several times in our paragraph, seeing that in each instance the place where G’d spoke to Yaakov was in the middle of the path, not while he was in a town.

Verse 16

כברת, a word which is similar to Job 34,24ירוע כבירים, “He breaks the mighty ones.” In our context it means something similar to הרבה, a considerable amount. The reason why Rachel was buried at that spot was because it was still a considerable distance from Efrat, and it would not have been dignified to transport her without a coffin for such a distance.
ותקש, this means the same as if it had said vatekashe. We have similar constructions such as ותצו as alternative for vatetzaveh, or ותכס, vatechasseh.


Verse 17

אל תראי כי גם זה לך בן, in accordance with Rachel’s prayer at the time Joseph was born (30,24) when she asked G’d to grant her another son. The midwife reassured Rachel that G’d did not mean to kill her but that He had accepted her prayer. She wanted to calm Rachel‘s fear for her life.

Verse 18

BINYAMIN.  Son of [my] old age [z'kunim].  Son of a long time [yamim].  As in (Dan. 12:13), "the end of days" [l'ketz hayamin], like "hayamim."

Verse 19



Verse 20

היא מצבת קבורת רחל, the one Samuel referred to after the latter departed from him, having been anointed king over Israel. (Samuel I 10,2)

Verse 21

למגדל העדר, close to Bethlehem as mentioned in Michah 5,1 as well as in chapter 4,8 there.

Verse 22

וישמע ישראל, this matter has been reported only so that we can understand why Yaakov passed over his firstborn son Reuven when in his blessings before his death he referred to him as פחז כמים אל תותר כי עלית על משכבי אביך (49,4). “the one who was as unrestrained as water when you mounted the bed of your father, does not deserve the privileges associated with the birthright.” [These privileges were allocated by Yaakov in part to Yehudah, commencing with the reign of David, and in part to Joseph, as the firstborn son of Rachel. The latter was accorded two tribal heads, (Ephrayim and Menashe) among the twelve tribes. Ed.]

Verse 23

ויהיו בני יעקב שנים עשר. Now that Binyamin had been born the total number of Yaakov’s son amounted to 12. This verse has been delayed in order not to break the sequence of the narrative.

Verse 28



Verse 29

עשו ויעקב, they are mentioned in this order, a) because Esau was the firstborn, and, b) Yaakov deferred to him according him this honour. When the Torah described Avraham’s funeral, Yitzchok, the younger, was mentioned first seeing that Yishmael was the son of a slave-woman.

Chapter 36



Verse 1



Verse 2

עשו לקח את נשיו מבנות כנען, people who read the text carefully cannot help noting that when Esau’s wives’ names are mentioned for the first time in 26,34 they were referred to as יהודית בת בארי החתי and בשמת בת אלון החתי, as well as מחלת בת ישמעאל. In our paragraph no one by the name of בת בארי is mentioned at all, neither the woman’s name nor her father’s name. However אלון as well as ישמעאל the fathers of two of Esau’s wives have been mentioned here also. The names of the daughters have been inverted as happens in many instances. בשמת daughter of אלון is here referred to as עדה בת אלון whereas. It is therefore reasonable to assume that יהודית בת בארי died childless, whereas the other two wives of Esau bore children for him as is enumerated here. Esau took אהליבמה בת ענה בת צבעון החוי as a wife after his move to Seir, when he wanted to strengthen his political ties with the local inhabitants through intermarriage with them. This is why the Torah gave such a detailed account of Oholivamah’s genealogy. Timnah, concubine of Eliphaz, Esau’s firstborn, was also from the original inhabitants of the region of Mount Seir, The reasom why she is mentioned ast, is that the marriage of Esau to Oholivamah occurred last.  Chronologically, she belonged to an earlier generation.


Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

מפני יעקב אחיו, seeing that Yaakov had bought the birthright, and by rights he was entitled to inherit the estate of his father Yitzchok, i.e. the land of Canaan. Therefore, Esau decided to vacate that land in favour of his brother.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

ואלה תולדות עשו, a reference to his grandchildren, similar to Genesis 10,1 where after the same introduction, the grandsons of Noach are listed by the Torah. [not quite, as the chapter starts with the words ואלה תולדות בני נח. Ed.]

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

ותמנע היתה פילגש, I have found in a Midrash on Psalms (שוחר טוב) that the prefix ו before the word תמנע suggests that this word may be read as part of what follows or as part of what preceded it. In fact, in Chronicles I 1,36 בני אליפז, תימן ואומר צפי וגעתם קנז ותמנע ועמלק it is understood as belonging to verse 11 in our chapter.
In the version in Chronicles, when listing the descendants of the בני שעיר, Timna is again listed in verse 39 as a sister of Lotan. This is parallel to Machalat, the daughter of Yishmael whom Esau married as a concession to his parents’ disgust with his other wives (Genesis 28,9) being described asאחות נביות “a sister to Nevayot, son of Yishmael.” The description of a woman as a sister of her brother rather than as a daughter of her father or mother also occurs in Exodus 15,20 where Miriam is described as Aaron’s sister. What happened here is that the first time Timna is mentioned, she is described in terms of he relationship to Avraham’s family, i.e. as the concubine of a great grandson of Avraham, Eliphaz, son of Esau, whereas the second time Timna is described as a sister of Lotan (verse 22) not genetically related to Avraham at all, but part of the genealogy of the בני שעיר. Such digressions in the sequence of a narrative are not unknown in the Bible. We find the following in Joshua 13,7-8 after G’d had instructed him at the beginning of the chapter to proceed with distributing the land of Israel to the various tribes, ועתה חלק את הארץ הזאת בנחלה לתשעת השבטים וחצי שבט המנשה. עמו הראובני והגדי לקחו נחלתם אשר נתן להם משה בעבר הירדן מזרחה נתן להם משה עבד ה' “Therefore, divide this territory into hereditary portions for the nine tribes and the half tribe of Menashe. Now, the Reubenites and the Gadites, along with the other half tribe of Menashe had already received their shares which Moses assigned to them on the east side of the Jordan- as assigned to them by Moses the servant of the Lord.” There can be no question that something is missing here as part of the second verse. You would have to say that this verse answered the question implied by the first verse, i.e. “what about the other half of the tribe of Menashe?” The reason for this peculiar division in describing the tribal allocation for the tribe of Menashe is that one half of the tribe, i.e. the half mentioned last, received their allocation by the authority of Moses himself, whereas the second half of the tribe received its allocation by the authority of Joshua. I, Samuel, (our author) have found a third verse [in addition to the two mentioned in the Midrash quoted. Ed.]  about the genealogy in Chronicles I 8,35-36 where we deal with the family of Yonathan son of King Sha-ul the following: ובני מיכה פיתון ומלך ותארע ואחז. ואחז הוליד את יהועדה, ויהועדה הוליד את עלמת וגו'.. “The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Taarea, and Achaz. Achaz begot Yehoadah; and Yehoadah begot Alemeth, etc.” This same paragraph is repeated once more in chapter 9,41-43. In that sequence mention of Achaz is missing in the first of the two verses so that he appears out of nowhere in the second verse. Not only that but he is introduced with the connective letter ו, i.e. “and Achaz, etc. We must therefore conclude that the word ואחז הוליד, “and Achaz begot,” answers the verse which had in effect been interrupted in 8,35 with the word אחז. The author takes up the thread interrupted in chapter 8 and fills the reader in about the offspring of Achaz. 

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

All the Alufim mentioned in this chapter are heads of cities of clans. I believe that the אלוף קרח mentioned in this verse as one of the sons of Eliphaz is identical with the תמנע mentioned in Chronicles as a son of Eliphaz, (compare verse 12) whereas the קרח, mentioned in verse 18 here as the son of Oholovimah, is a different person by the same name.

Verse 16



Verse 17

Verse 19



Verse 20

יושבי הארץ, originally, before Esau’s time. The clan of Esau inherited their land as mentioned in Deuteronomy 2,12 וישבו תחתם, “they settled in their place. (replaced them)”

Verse 21



Verse 22

ואחות לוטן תמנע. Seeing that Lotan was the outstanding one among his brothers, Timna’s genealogy is linked to her prominent brother rather than to her father. We have encountered the same principle when Machalat whom Esau married to assuage the hurt feelings of his parents, is described as the sister of Nevayot, a son of Yishmael. Also Miriam the prophetess, is described as Aaron’s sister instead of as Amram’s daughter. (Exodus 15,20)

Verse 23



Verse 24

ואיה וענה, I believe that the real names of these people were “Veayah” and “Veanah,” not “Ayah” and “Anah.” The same is true of Numbers 13,14 where the letter ו is part of the name itself, i.e. ופסי, just as it is in Esther where the letter ו is part of the name of Queen Vashti, i.e. ושתי. Even though these sons of Tzivon are also referred to by the names Ayah and Adah in Chronicles I 1,40, we need not attribute too much meaning to this, as there are numerous instances when such names are not accurately reported.  (Examples of such inaccuracies are Genesis 10,23 where the letters ו in the words וחול וגתר (names) clearly are not part of the names themselves. The same is true of Chronicles I 1,17 where all four of these names are introduced with the letter ו. Clearly, the two versions cannot both be correct. Anyone who interprets the letter ו in the words (names) ואיה וענה to be connective letters ו, must surely answer the question of what prompted the Torah to write such connective letters ו here when it did not seem to be called for. Why would just these sons have been selected by the Torah to be linked to one another by the connective letter ו and not numerous other sons who appear in this chapter? [the author challenges his grandfather Rashi’s interpretation. Ed.] The proofs cited by such commentators for their interpretation are not convincing at all. The very letters ו whom these commentators quote as support for their thesis are themselves not connective letters For instance, in Samuel II 13,20 the line ותשב תמר ושוממה בית אבשלום אחיה, the word ושוממה means the same as שבי, as in שבי אלמנה בית אביך, (Genesis 38,11) where Yehudah tells his daughter-in-law (also) called Tamar to await Shelah’s growing up by remaining like a grieving widow in her father’s house. The word ותשב in Samuel II 13.20 has two meanings. It tells us that Tamar henceforth was isolated, lonely, an outcast. The word בודדה for “lonely,” is implied but not spelled out, and the whole line must be understood as if the prophet had written ותשב תמר בודדה ושוממה, “Tamar lived lonely and abandoned in the house of her brother Avshalom.” Psalms 76,7 מגערתך אלוקי יעקב נרדם ורכב וסוס, must be understood as מגערת אלוקי יעקב נרדם חיל שונאינו, at Your blast, O G’d of Yaakov, horse and chariot (with our enemies) lay stunned.” The reference is to the army mentioned in the preceding verses. The word אנשי חיל, “the soldiers,” which appears in verse 6 of that chapter is presumed as also applying to verse 7. If this were not so, the verse would make little sense. We find that a similar verse to that in Psalms 77,7 is found in Exodus 15,1, where the Torah includes the riders of the cavalry as having been tossed into the sea, as their survival would hardly have constituted an overwhelming victory by G’d.
הוא ענה, who has been mentioned in the time of Moses as a great hero. [I do not know where. Ed.]
אשר מצא את היימים, either powerful human beings, or ferocious animals, in either case “who found,” means he located and vanquished them. According to the plain meaning of the text there is no need to search for additional meanings.

ואלה שמות אלופי עשא למשפחותם למקומותם, among the “Alufim” listed in the verses following there are several who had been mentioned earlier simply as sons of Esau. We must assume that these sons eventually rose in rank to become “Alufim.” We already mentioned that the title “Aluf” essentially means that the people so described were mayors of cities, which is most likely the reason why the Torah adds the word למקומותם, “in their respective locations.” Proof of the correctness of what I surmise may be the fact that in Chronicles all the details provided by the Torah here in this chapter are repeated verbatim. However, the first list of the “Alufim” of the sons of Esau (36,15-19) are not mentioned there at all.

Chapter 37



Verse 1

וישב יעקב, whereas Esau had moved to another country on account of his brother Yaakov, Yaakov settled near his father in the land in which both he, his father, and his grandfather had only sojourned up until now. He claimed this right as the result of having purchased the birthright from his older brother.

Verse 2

אלה תולדות יעקב, intelligent people must remember that our sages taught us that in spite of all different methods of exegesis of the text of the written Torah, no verse may legitimately be explained in a manner which contradicts the plain meaning of the text. While it is true that the Torah, by means of allusions, grammatical anomalies, tone-signs, etc., teaches us far more than meets the eye when we look at the bald text, there are strict limitations even to these methods of exegesis such as the thirteen principles of Rabbi Yishmael and the 32 principles of Rabbi Yossi Haglili. Exegetes of former times, thanks to their piety, relied exclusively on the drashot i.e. allegorical and ethical interpretations of anomalies in the text of the Torah, thereby neglecting a thorough study of the text as it presents itself to the average, though not scholarly, reader. Seeing that our sages stated אל תרבו בניכם בהגיון, “do not burden your children overly with interpretation based on logic, on common sense,” and they also saidהעוסק במקרא מדה ואינו מדה, העוסק בתלמוד אין לך מדה גדולה מזו, “he who studies the written text of the Torah has accomplished something positive but has also failed to accomplish something positive, but on the other hand, he who has studied Talmud has chosen by far the best path in Torah study,” (freely translated), the result of such statements has been that students have not become used to studying the plain meaning of the text without immediately looking at exegesis. (Baba Metzia 33 and a source supposedly in Berachot 28, the correct text being מנעו בניכם מן ההגיון, prevent your children from indulging in speculative reason,” but this does not seem to have any connection with Torah exegesis in the context where the statement is made. Ed.] This principle has been illustrated in Shabbat 63; we read there in the name of Rav Kahane “I was already eighteen years old and had studied the entire Talmud, but had not ever been taught of the principle that אין מקרא יוצא מידי פשוטו, “that the text in the written Torah must not be interpreted in a manner which completely nullifies its plain meaning.” Also Rabbi Shlomoh, my mother’s father of blessed memory (Rashi) the brilliant exegete, who wrote commentaries on the entire Bible, was careful not to ignore the plain meaning of the text. I, Shmuel, son of Rabbi Meir, Rashi’s son-in-law, have argued with him, and he admitted to me that if he had the opportunity, he would compose an additional commentary in which he would concentrate on the plain meaning as it became clearer to him with each passing day. [I believe that the wording here means that Rashi meant that just as his published commentaries consisted mostly of anthologies, i.e. his quoting existing interpretations, so he would search out more commentaries based on the plain meaning to present to the reader when publishing another commentary. Ed.] I am now presenting to the reader what earlier exegetes had to say on our verse.
אלה תולדות יעקב, “the following describes events and problems which Yaakov encountered in his life.” [by the way, Seforno, who lived hundreds of years later than Rash’bam, also accepts the interpretation described as nonsensical by Rash’bam. Ed.] This exegesis is nonsense. Whenever the expression תולדות occurs in the Bible, sometimes this word introduces the names of the grandsons of the party referred to, such as in Genesis 6,9 where the Torah after describing the righteousness of Noach tells us that Noach had three sons and proceeds to give us their names. The names of the sons could not be the purpose of the story there, as we had been told earlier in 5,32 that Noach at the age of 500 sired three sons and we were already told their names. The Torah then continues to describe mankind’s ongoing corruption and that Noach was the only one with whom G’d was pleased. When the Torah commences a second time with the line אלה תולדות נח in 6,9, clearly the Torah does not mean to repeat itself, but it leads to the Torah telling us of Noach’s grandchildren, something that is reported in greater detail in 10,1 under the heading of “and these are the generations of the sons of Noach.” [Perhaps the reason for the repetition of אלה תולדות בני נח in chapter 10, is that if, as the author says, the grandchildren were meant already in chapter 6, now after the deluge, the task of these children to generate a new mankind began in earnest, whereas up to that point they were charged with merely surviving the deluge. Ed.]  Just as the Torah reported the growth and development of mankind after the deluge until we have a total of 70 such descendants of Noach being named, so in chapter 36,6 we have been told of the descendants of Esau who have been born in the land of Canaan, i.e. the land in which his father lived. After that, the Torah reported Esau’s further development in Mount Seir, commencing with verse 9 of that chapter. The Torah reports the development of Yaakov’s family in a parallel manner, 35,23 extending through verses 26-27 and listing all his children who had been born in exile, while he was in Padan Aram with Lavan. Now the Torah continues with the words אלה תולדות יעקב, concentrating forthwith on the grandchildren who combine to make up a total of 70 prior to the descent of the family to Egypt. Details of the birth of these various grandchildren are being provided, beginning with the chronicle of what happened to Joseph, who at 17 years of age experienced traumatic events, as a result of which his older brother Yehudah separated from the other brothers and started his own family in Keziv and Adulam, siring three sons, and grandsons respectively, i.e. Shelah, Peretz and Zerach. The history of Yaakov’s family became complicated further with Joseph having been brought to Egypt as a slave where Menashe and Ephrayim were born for him. Having attained high office, Joseph invited his father and family to join him in Egypt so that ultimately 70 members of Yaakov’s family wound up in Egypt. Moses had to record all this in order to substantiate his claim in Deuteronomy 10,22 that “your fathers descended to Egypt when they numbered only 70 persons.”
בן שבע עשרה שנה, this was necessary so that we realise that the separation of Joseph from his father –during which time Yaakov had considered his as dead- lasted for 22 years. The Torah testified in 41,26 that Joseph was 30 years old when presented to Pharaoh, after which time 7 good years and 2 years of famine occurred before Yaakov and family descended to settle in Egypt, making a total of 22 years of separation.
היה רועה את אחיו בצאן, the sons of Leah, are referred to as his brothers, seeing that they were the sons of a major wife, as opposed to the sons of Zilpah and Bilhah who ranked lower on the social scale, though also half-brothers of Joseph. They are therefore referred to here only as the sons for their respective mothers.
והוא נער את בני בלהה ואת בני זלפה, he spent most of his time in the company of those four children who were far closer to him in age. The fact that Joseph preferred the company of the sons of the servant-maids may have been the beginning of the sons of Leah resenting him.
את אחיו, he was tending the sheep with his brothers, but, seeing that he still enjoyed his carefree childhood he spent most of his time with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, instead of in the company of the sons of Leah. As a 17 year old he should have acted like a נער, an adolescent lad approaching manhood. This is the meaning of the word נער in Hoseah 11,1 Samuel II 2,14. The Torah now enumerates a number of other causes which contributed to the brothers hating Joseph. [this was how Leah’s sons viewed his behaviour, not how Joseph explained it. Ed.]
ויבא יוסף את דבתם רעה, the language is somewhat inverted and means the same as את דבתם של אחיו רעה, “reports of his brothers‘ wrongdoing.” This is in line with the interpretation of Bereshit Rabbah, as quoted by Rashi that Joseph told his father that the sons of Leah treated the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah with disdain. He contrasted this with his own behaviour towards these half brothers of his, whom he professed to honour and spend extra time with them as proof of his considering them equal. Other commentators have not related to the principal meaning of our verse. [the brothers would not have known about Joseph badmouthing them as Yaakov would not have told them. Hence they never reacted to this. Ed.]

Verse 3

וישראל אהב, all of the aforementioned details caused the brothers to become jealous of Joseph.
בן זקונים, he was the most recently born of 11 children. There had been a considerable interval before Binyamin, the last of Yaakov’s children was born. Yaakov’s inordinate love for Joseph developed long before Binyamin was born.
כתונת פסים, a cloak, (compare Samuel II 13,18 Tamar’s cloak).

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

ועל דבריו, the badmouthing. [how did the brothers find out about this? Ed.]

Verse 9



Verse 10

מה החלום הזה?, even if Joseph’s mother had still been alive, Yaakov would still have rebuked Joseph for having such a dream.

Verse 11

ואביו שמר את הדבר. Why did the Torah bother to write this line? The reason is that when the brothers returned from Egypt and reported about Joseph’s position there, and Yaakov did not believe them that Joseph was still alive, he saw the carriages which Pharaoh had sent to transport him in (45,27) and realised that such an honour could only be bestowed by a king, and that seeing that the King of Egypt had no reason to honour him in such a manner, the carriages, though sent with the approval of Pharaoh, must have been sent by someone in an almost equally high position, i.e. his son Joseph, who had dreamed of attaining such stature. It was the recollection of the dream Joseph had told him about which then prompted Yaakov to exclaim רב,עוד יוסף בני חי, וכי הוא מושל בכל בארץ מצרים, “it is too much! Not only is my son Joseph still alive, but he is the ruler of the whole land of Egypt!” (45,28 combined with 26)

Verse 12



Verse 13

הלא אחיך רועים בשכם, the wording reflects Yaakov's surprise that Joseph’s brothers chose to tend their sheep in a dangerous location such as Shechem where they had killed the local inhabitants not so long ago. (this is what I heard from Rabbi Yoseph Karo our colleague. I enjoyed his interpretation greatly. [this was not original as it is found in Targum Yerushalmi. David Rosin, Ed.]

Verse 14

ויבא שכמה, when he came to Shechem he did not find them there.

Verse 15

'וימצאהו איש והנה תועה וגו, this paragraph has been written in order to demonstrate the reliability and eagerness of Joseph to comply with his father’s wishes; he did not use the fact that the brothers were no longer in Shechem as an excuse to abort his mission and to return home, but kept searching for them until, in the end, he located them. He remembered that part of his father’s instructions had been השיבני דבר, “bring me back a report!”

Verse 16



Verse 17

בדותן, according to the plain meaning this was the name of a town, and the town is also mentioned in the Book of Kings II 6,13.

Verse 18

ויתנכלו אותו, they were full of devious and nefarious thoughts. The word occurs in this sense in Maleachi 1,24: וארור נוכל, “cursed the person who plots deviously.”

Verse 19

הלזה; whenever the word הלזה is mentioned it refers to someone or something that one sees from afar, indistinctly. For instance in Genesis 24,65 Rivkah asked Eliezer who the man was who was approaching them from a distance. The word הזה, on the other hand, refers to someone or something close at hand, as for instance Haman in Esther 7,6, to whom Esther points when the King asked here who the culprit was who wanted to destroy her and her people.

Verse 20

לכו ונהרגהו, the introduction לכו is an invitation for other people to participate in a planned undertaking. We have a similar example in verse 27 of our chapter when the brothers sell Joseph and Yehudah introduces the plan with the words לכו ונמכרנו לישמעאלים, “let us sell him to the Ishmaelites.” Another similar example is found in Exodus 1,10 when Pharaoh invites his people to outsmart the Israelites with the words הבה נתחכמה לו. In that verse the word הבה is used as such an invitation. Compare also Deuteronomy 11,26, where the word ראה is used in the same manner, except that it does not involve active participation by those addressed

Verse 21

ויצילהו מידם, he saved his life, no more.

Verse 22

השליכו אותו אל הבור הזה אשר במדבר, where no one passes so that he will die from natural causes.
למען הציל, in order to really save him. The verse illustrates Reuven’s intention of not only saving Joseph’s life, but of bringing him back safely to his father, as the Torah testifies later in the course of its narrative.

Verse 23

את כתונת הפסים, the only reason why these words have been inserted here is to remind the reader of what had been the cause of the entire tragic episode of fraternal hatred. However, if the Torah had not added these words, we would have been misled. The fact that the Torah describes the brothers sending the blood-spattered tattered remains of this tunic to their father (verse 33) was designed to deceive their father into believing that what happened to Joseph had nothing to do with his father having had this garment made for him and the brothers having resented this. The Torah does not want us, the readers, to be misled as the brothers had succeeded in misleading their father into thinking that he had become the victim of a wild animal.

Verse 24

אין בו מים. If the pit had been full of water the brothers would not have thrown him into the pit, as they then would have been guilty of drowning him, i.e. killing him with their own hands, as it were. They had said themselves “let not our hands be on him.”

Verse 25



Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28

ויעברו אנשים מדינים, while the brothers had been sitting down to consume their meal, having distanced themselves somewhat from the pit into which they had thrown Joseph in order not to be guilty of “eating while spilling blood,” they were waiting for the Ishmaelites whom they had seen in the distance, to arrive. During this period the Midianites, coming from a different direction had passed there, saw Joseph in the pit, pulled him up, and proceeded to sell him to the Ishmaelites. One may assume that the brothers had no knowledge of this. Even though the Torah appears to attribute the sale of Joseph to the Ishmaelites to the brothers, (based on Joseph accusing them of having sold him to Egypt, 45,4) we would have to say that because of their having been instrumental in bringing about that sale they are considered as if having assisted in that sale. This appears to me the deeper meaning of the plain meaning of the text both here and in chapter 45. The line describing the Midianites passing that way is described as something totally coincidental, having nothing to do with what the brothers had planned to do with Joseph. Even if the Torah says:וימכרו (את) יוסף לישמעאלים, this sounds as if the brothers did the selling. It is also possible that the brothers noting the Midianites suddenly materialising out of nowhere, instructed them to pull Joseph out of the pit after which they themselves sold him to the Ishmaelites.

Verse 29



Verse 30

אנה אני בא!, what did I came to the pit for!

Verse 31



Verse 32

וישלחו, by means of human messengers who would not identify themselves, saying only: “this is what we have found!”

Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35

כי ארד, I will not be consoled but will descend to my grave joining my son while still mourning his death.
ויבך אותו אביו, for a long period of time. Seeing that the line is superfluous, our sages, as quoted by Rashi, added that Yitzchok (his father) wept for the anguish of his son Yaakov although he knew that Joseph  had not been killed.

Verse 36

והמדנים מכרו אותו אל מצרים. The Midianites, Medanites, and the Ishmaelites are brotherly tribes. (compare 25,20) According to the plain meaning of the text, they are the same people, sometimes called by one name, other times by the other name. This is why the Torah wrote here that the Midianites had sold him, whereas the Ishmaelites had transported him there.

Chapter 38



Verse 1



Verse 2

כנעני, a merchant, as per Onkelos. The word appears in that sense both in Isaiah 23,8 כנעניה נכבדי ארץ, “as its merchants, the land’s nobles.” The word כנעני also occurs in this sense in Hoseah 12,8 כנען בידו מאזני מרמה, “a trader who uses false weights.” The word cannot refer to the local Canaanite inhabitants as the sons of Yaakov were very careful not to intermarry with these people.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

והיה בכזיב, Yehudah was at that location and that is where the child was born.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

כי לא לו יהיה הזרע, people in those days were extremely fussy about this point.
נתן זרע, the vowel kametz here is in fact a chataf kametz, as every word spelled plene, i.e. with the vowel cholem as the letter ו when it appears in construct form such as here has this vowel shortened to a chataf kametz. The result is that the stress will be on the last syllable, whereas the word following immediately afterwards will have its stress on the first syllable. In effect this makes the words נתן זרע in our verse as if they had been connected by the hyphen, makkif. Other examples of similar constructions are Psalms 145,8 ארך אפים וגדל חסד [where the word גדל is a shortened version of גדול with the ו as the vowel cholem. Ed.] Another example is found in Exodus 21,11 ואם שלש אלה לא יעשה לה, “if he will do none of these three things for her, etc.” Yet another such construction is found in Numbers 35,14 אבל את שלש הערים, “however the three cities, etc.” 

Verse 10

גם אותו. According to our sages Er also died for this same type of sin, as he deliberately wasted his semen by ejaculating prematurely to prevent his wife from becoming pregnant. He wanted to preserve her physical beauty.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

ותכס, she covered her head.
ותכס ראשה בצעיף, not the customary manner for a widow to wear her shawl.
ותתעלף, she covered her face so as not to be identified.
בפתח עינים, at the public square where the road forked off in two different directions. The word עינים is used to describe the fact that anyone standing or sitting there was in plain view of anyone traveling these roads. Commentators who translate the word עינים as the name of a town are wrong, as is clear from the words בעינים על הדרך in verse 21. If there had been a town there, the Torah would have had to write בעינים with the semi vowel sheva under the letter ב. We do not find such constructions as בעינים as in verse 21 when reference is made to other cities such as ביריחו, “at Jericho,” or בבית-אל, “at Bet-El,” or בירושלים, “at Jerusalem.”


Verse 15

כי כסתה פניה, only at this point, in accordance with our commentary on the word ותתעלף, (verse 14)

Verse 16



Verse 17

עד שלחך. The reason why we have the “weak” mode, i.e. the conjugation kal instead of the transitive conjugation hiphil, is to indicate that Yehudah would send a messenger to deliver the kid to Tamar. We find the use of the conjugation kal in connection with the sending of gifts especially, as for instance in 32,19 where Yaakov had instructed his messengers to Esau to describe the gift in such terms. (מנחה היא שלוחה) We find it again in verse 23 of our chapter where Yehudah says הנה שלחתי הגדי הזה, “here, I have sent this kid, etc.”

Verse 18

חותמך, your ring.
פתילך, your outer garment,
ומטך, and your staff. She asked for three items none of which were necessary as garments for Yehudah, but were merely decorative, lending Yehudah a better image among his peers.


Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

הקדשה, the harlot; a woman who is always ready to have sexual relations with any male. The male equivalent of the term is found in Deuteronomy 23,18. where the Torah instructs the Jewish people not to tolerate this phenomenon, and in Kings I 14,24 where the presence of such male prostitutes is acknowledged with the words וגם קדש היה בארץ, a phenomenon which surfaced immediately after the death of King Solomon.

Verse 22



Verse 23

תקח לה, not literally “let her take it,” but “let her keep it.” Yehudah said that he would not make an additional effort to find her and to redeem his pledges.
פן נהיה לבוז, so we will not make ourselves laughing stocks by chasing after harlots.


Verse 24

זנתה תמר כלתך, if you were to ask why Yehudah would believe such accusations which would be hard to prove, the informant added that the signs of her pregnancy spoke for themselves as proof of the accusation being justified.
ותשרף, according to the plain meaning of the text this was the standard penalty for a widow of Tamar’s status who had engaged in illicit sex.


Verse 25

היא מוצאת, after she had taken out the pledges given to her by Yehudah and sent them to him via a messenger, she did not want to directly confront him, but said: ”I am pregnant for the man who owned these.”

Verse 26

צדקה ממני, more righteous than I. He referred to her accusation (words) as compared to his accusation (words) against her. “I had commanded her to remain in her father’s house until Shelah would grow up. She complied with the terms of our understanding. However, I did not keep my part of the bargain I had struck with her.” כי ..לא נתתיה לשלה בני, the construction here is similar to Job 32,2: על צדקו נפשו מאלוקים, “because he thought himself more righteous than G’d.” Another similar construction occurs in Samuel I 24,18 with King Sha-ul who admitted to David that he had been wrong in persecuting him with the words: צדיק אתה ממני, “you are more righteous than I.”...
ולא יסף, he did not continue to sleep with Tamar. If you were to interpret the words ולא יסף as “he did not stop sleeping with her,” the wording should have been: ולא יסף עוד מלדעתה.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30

זרח. On account of the woolen thread which was red in colour. The word זרח basically means red, such as the colour of the sun at the time it rises and when it sets. If it does not appear red during the day this is because of the excess amount of light during those hours making it impossible for us to notice the red colour behind all that light. We find confirmation of the redness of the sun in Kings II 3,22 when the Moabites were deceived by believing that the rising sun’s redness represented blood remaining from a violent battle and they thought they could then simply move over to the camp of the Israelites and pick up the spoils.

Verse 6

ולא ידע אתו מאומה, in the house
כי אם הלחם אשר הוא אוכל, he did not oversee any of the affairs of his household, not caring where everything originated until the food came on his table, when he proceeded to eat it. The word לחם is an inclusive term applying to any manner of food. It is used in the same sense in Daniel 5,1 עבד לחם רב, “he made a great banquet.” Also in Job 3,24 כי לפני לחמי אנחתי, “my groaning serves me as my food.”
(3) WITH HIM THERE, HE PAID NO ATTENTION.  From all the household affairs, he did not see anything except at the time of eating.

Verse 4

ויפקד שר הטבחים, he appointed him to look after all the needs of the various prisoners in that jail.
ויהי ימים, he remained in that position for a whole year. We know that the word ימים means “a year,” from Leviticus 25,29 ימים תהיה גאולתו, “it (the house) may be redeemed for up to one year.” Also in Genesis 24,55 the words ימים או עשור meant “a year, or at least 10 months.”


Verse 5

Verse 8

ופותר אין אותו, as if the Torah had written ואין פותר אותו, “there is no one who knows how to interpret it.” We encounter a similar inverted verse in Ezekiel 33,32 ועושים אינם אותם, which by right should have been ואינם עושים אותם, “but will not obey them. (carry them out)”

Verse 9



Verse 10

כפורחת עלתה נצה, this was the customary sequence of a fruit’s development. Compare Numbers 17,23ויוצא פרח ויצץ ציץ ויגמול שקדים, “it brought forth a blossom, sprouted a bud, and almonds ripened.” 

Verse 11

ואשחוט, I squeezed.

Verse 12



Verse 13

ישא פרעה את ראשך, the use of the word ישא here is similar to the use of the same word in Numbers 1,2 שאו את ראש כל עדת ישראל, “count the whole community of Israel, etc.”  After three days Pharaoh will again number you among his servants.
והשיבך, in order to restore you to your position. The construction והשיבך meaning “in order to restore your position to you,” is also what happened as we know from verse 20  “he elevated the head cupbearer among his servants. Had the Torah written veheshivcha instead of vahashivcha, the meaning would have been “he will restore you, bring you back,” as in Deuteronomy 28,68.


Verse 14

כי אם זכרתני אתך, Joseph expressed his absolute conviction that the Chief of the cup bearers would be reinstated and that he would have the power to bring about his release, seeing that he was innocent. Besides, his very position as a slave was totally unjustified as he had been born a free man, member of a prestigious family. He was neither obligated to work for someone else, nor was he legally incarcerated.

Verse 15



Verse 16

כי טוב פתר, his interpretation sounded very convincing, was accepted as the true interpretation.
סלי חרי; full of holes. The word חורים, appears as meaning holes in Job 30,6 חורי עפר וכפים, “holes in the ground and in rocks.” It also appears in this sense in Isaiah 19,9 ואורגים חורי, “and the weavers making holes.” Baskets which are usually of woven palm frond leaves have these little holes as the nature of weaving does not permit the resulting texture of the material to be airtight and waterproof.


Verse 17



Verse 18

Verse 23

ולא זכר שר המשקים את יוסף, as soon as he came out of prison. Joseph had asked him to remember his case as soon as he would come out of prison, but he did not remember.
וישכחהו, he kept forgetting him until Pharaoh had his dream which defied satisfactory interpretation. When G’d performed a miracle for the sake of Joseph, he was forced to remember him.


Chapter 41



Verse 1

ויהי מקץ שנתים ימים, two whole years according to Leviticus 25,29-30 ימים תהיה גאולתו, “it may be redeemed until the end of one year.” Here the Torah speaks of שנתים, i.e. twice a year. The word ימים as meaning a year has already occurred in Genesis 24,54 ימים או עשור, “a year or at least 10 months.” Also in Exodus 13,10 we find the expressionמימים ימימה, which  means: “from year to year, annually.” When the words מקץ שנתים occur without the addition of the word ימים, they mean “one year.” When an animal did not yet reach the first anniversary of its birth it is called as being בן שנתו, “an up to one year old.” (compare Leviticus 12,6)

Verse 2

והנה מן היאור עולות, it is a common practice to water all the animals at the same time after which they all return to graze in the meadows. [as opposed to what occurred in Pharaoh’s dream. Ed.]
באחו, a place where herbs grow as we know from Job 8,11 ישגא אחו בלי מים, “can bulrushes grow without water?”


Verse 3



Verse 4

ויקץ פרעה, ויישן (מיד) ויחלום, normally when a person has dreamt a dream and has woken up going to sleep again thereafter, any dream during the second sleep will focus on another subject. As a result, he is not even aware yet that that he had completed his first sleep and had become wholly awake. Pharaoh, on the other hand, was immediately fully awake, even before going back to sleep and having another dream. Only after his second awakening did he realise that the whole vivid pictures he had seen while asleep were not reality but were a dream. (verse 7)

Verse 5

בקנה אחד, this was a symbol of plenty, seeing that each stalk had seven ears of grain

Verse 6

והנה חלום. Just as Yaakov had faced a new reality in 29,25 when he woke up finding that Leah had been his mate in bed, so Pharaoh now faced a new reality, i.e. he found that what he had considered as reality, the images he saw while he had been asleep, had only been a dream.

Verse 7



Verse 8

ותפעם רוחו; his mind was thoroughly disturbed so that he felt the urgent need to explore the meaning of this dream. We find that King Nevuchadnezzar’s mind was similarly disturbed by a dream when he called in Daniel in Daniel 2,3.after his own experts had failed him. [Of course, on that occasion the king was not even able to recall what he had dreamt and he set his interpreters an impossible task, not like here. Ed.]

Verse 9



Verse 10

פרעה קצף על עבדיו, the word Pharaoh in Egyptian means “king.” All the Egyptian kings are known as “Pharaoh,” whereas the kings of the Philistines are known as “Avimelech” even as late as the time of King David when the latter pretended to be mentally disturbed  (Psalms 34,1) The city of Jerusalem used to be known as “Tzedek,” as we know from Genesis 14,18 as well as Joshua 10,1) During the reign of David, compare Psalms 110,4, G’d refers to Jerusalem as such, seeing that Malki Tzedek is described as “King of Jerusalem. The kings of the nation Amalek were known as “Agag,” [not only the one mentioned in the Book of Samuel. Ed.] (Numbers 24,7, Samuel I 15,8) In our verse here Pharaoh is not the name of an individual but that of the title accorded the Egyptian head of state. The proof for this is simple. Who would dare to address the King by his first name or even by his family name instead of by his title? Certainly not a cup bearer or a recently released prisoner such as Joseph at the time! This is also why Joseph was renamed אברך, meaning אב למלך, “father of the king,” provider. The author of the book לקח טוב has also written in this vein.

Verse 11



Verse 12

איש כחלומו פתר, “according to the meaning of the dream he interpreted.” [this could only be said with hindsight, of course, after the interpretation had proven itself as correct. Ed.] The words following prove this.

Verse 13

AND IT WAS AS HE INTERPRETED ETC.  Me he restored to my post.

Verse 14



Verse 15

תשמע חלום, you understand a dream and are able to explain its meaning.

Verse 16

בלעדי, this matter does not depend on me but on G’d; He may let me know how to put your mind at ease.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

ולא נודע כי באו אל קרבנה, thus Pharaoh said to Joseph at this time; he only now remembered that at the time that he had been dreaming it had appeared to him as if there was no trace of these seven fat cows having come into the lean cows. However, at the time when he had dreamt, i.e. when the Torah told us what he had dreamt it would not have been appropriate to describe anything beyond the facts, i.e. that the lean cows had eaten the fat cows. At that point in the narrative there had been no call to describe Pharaoh’s subjective reaction to what he had seen.

Verse 22



Verse 23

וצנומות, its meaning is in accordance with the context in which the word appears. It is unique in Scriptures. One may suggest that the word means the same as in the Talmud Baba Batra 18 where it refers to something hard as stone, devoid of any moisture.


Verse 24



Verse 25

אשר האלוקים עושה, He has told Pharaoh what He will do in the near future. One king spoke to another king, seeing that the king is charged with making provisions against all eventualities.

Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

שבע גדול; the word שבע being a noun here and not a participle, has the vowels kametz under both the letters ש and ב, seeing the stress is on the last syllable. Other similar examples are the words דבר, davar, בקר, bakar, רעב, raav. and numerous more such examples.

Verse 30

ונשכח כל השבע , similar to the expression used before ולא נודע in verse 21.

Verse 31



Verse 32

ועל השנות החלום, if Joseph’s dreams of the stars and the sheaves of corn respectively, would have been dreamt by him in the same night, he would not have had to wait for 13 years until they would prove themselves as a true forecast of his rise to power.

Verse 33



Verse 34

ויפקד פקידים...וחמש, the general population would be required to hand over one fifth of the non-perishable parts of their harvest to a central storage facility administered by the government. According to Samuel warning the Jewish people of taxation that a king would impose upon them, (Samuel I 8,14-15) such taxation normally amounted to ten percent. Joseph now suggested that during the seven years of plenty this level of taxation be increased to twenty per cent, (a reserve for the people for the years of the famine to follow), not for the king’s needs as regular taxation.

Verse 35

ויצברו בר תחת יד, someone appointed for the task by Pharaoh. 
פרעה, All of this would be enforced against the wishes of the population. This is why Joseph spoke of the appointment of פקידים, overseers with powers of enforcement,ויצברו, this expression is also used when King Ahasverus appointed officials to bring all good looking virgins to his court so that he could eventually make the selection of a new queen replacing Vashti from amongst one of the. (Esther 2,3) 
The expression ויקבצו, “and they shall gather in,” is applied here to produce, whereas in Esther it was applied to people. [the reader can form his own opinion about human rights of women in Persia of old. Ed.]
אוכל בערים, there would be such storage silos in every city so people could buy during the years of the famine without having to travel far from their homes.


Verse 36



Verse 37



Verse 38

אשר רוח אלוקים בו, if he is able with G’d’s help to interpret intangibles such as dreams, he must certainly be smart enough to arrange administrative earthly affairs in a competent manner.

Verse 39

נבון, he understands the future, having been able to foresee it.

Verse 40

ישק, he will motivate people through clever use of weaponry to attack their enemies. The use of the word נשק meaning weapons occurs in Kings II 10,2 as עיר מבצר והנשק, “a fortified city and weaponry.” We also find it used in this sense in Psalms 78,9 נושקי רומי קשת, “being armed and carrying bows.”

Verse 41

נתתי אותך, “I have placed you.” Pharaoh said this to Joseph at the time he handed over his ring (seal of office) to him.

Verse 42

בגדי שש, the finest Egyptian garments made of superior linen. We know from Ezekiel 27,7 that such garments formed a well-known Egyptian export.
רביד, this describes something that is draped over a person. The word is similar to מרבדים in Proverbs 7,16 מרבדים רבדתי ערשי,”I have decked my couch with covers.”


Verse 43

במרכבת המשנה, a horse or mule especially designated for the King’s second in command to ride on.
אברך, “father of the king.” We have some proof for this from Baba Batra 4 לא רכא ולא בר רכא, “neither a king nor a king’s son. [since we can discount the letter א at the end, this being an Aramaic ending, if בר רכא means son of a king, then אברך means father of a king. Ed.] This is proven further from 45,8 when Joseph speaks of his position beingוישימני לאב לפרעה, “He (G’d) has placed me in the position of being a father (provider) for Pharaoh.” In effect this made Joseph “father” of the king. The word פרעה, after all, is simply a title, meaning “king,” not the personal name of an individual as we explained already on verse 10.


Verse 44

אני פרעה, “I am king;” this was another way of saying that he was Joseph’s superior only by the formality of occupying the throne. (verse 40)
לא ירים איש את ידו, to countermand your authority, such as Jerobam who is described as “מרים יד, raising  a hand against the king” (Solomon) in Kings I 11,27. Jerobam (a member of the tribe of Ephrayim) had first been appointed as in charge of all the forced labour from his tribe, the House of Joseph.


Verse 45

צפנת פענח, as translated by Onkelos, someone who reveals hidden things. It is a name taken from the Egyptian language. It was a common practice to link the name of a newly appointed official to his office in some manner. Moses changed the name of Joshua when he became selected to be one of the twelve spies. (Numbers 13,16) Similarly, Daniel, when appointed to high office by the king was renamed בל טשצר,  (Daniel 1,6 and Daniel 4,5). 
פוטיפרע, this is not the Potiphar who had acquired Joseph as a slave.
כהן און, a minister in the city of that name, as we know from Samuel II 8,18 ובני דוד כהנים היו, “the sons of David were priests.” [seeing that they belonged to the tribe of Yehudah, how could they have been priests (who were descended from Levi)? The meaning of כהן therefore, both in Samuel and in our verse, must be that they were in exalted positions.


Verse 46

בן שלושים, and old enough to assume the burden of high office.

Verse 47

ותעש הארץ, it produced bountiful harvests. We find the root עשה use in the same sense in Leviticus 25,21 when the Torah describes the bountiful harvests preceding the shemittah year in the words ועשת את התבואה לשלוש השנים, “it will produce a harvest sufficient for the three years.”
לקמצים, a single stalk of grain would yield several handfuls of flour.


Verse 48



Verse 49



Verse 50

בטרם תבא שנת הרעב, seeing that Yaakov arrived in Egypt at the beginning of the second year of the famine and he died at the end of seventeen years of having lived in Egypt, he said to Joseph prior to his death: “the two sons of yours who were born before I came i.e. Ephrayim and Menashe, will be to me as Reuven and Shimon.” Any children of Joseph, and he had such, who were born to him after his father arrived in Egypt would be considered as regular grandchildren of Yaakov in respect of the eventual parceling up to the tribes of the soil of the Holy Land. (48,5-6).

Verse 51

נשני, the construction of the word from the root נשש is similar to a similar construction of the root חנן in 33,11 where Yaakov explained to his brother Esau that he was looking at his children. The proof of this is the dagesh in the letter ש. [which effectively doubles that letter. Ed.] If the word nashani had been derived from the root נשה as in Isaiah 44,21 לא תנשני, or as in Lamentations 3,17, נשיתי טובה, where the root is one that loses its last root letter, the Torah here should have written nishani, instead of nashani. It then would have been parallel to the construction in Samuel II 19,27 עבדי רמני, rimani from the root רמה, to deceive, and other similar examples. 

Verse 52



Verse 53



Verse 54

ובכל ארץ מצרים היה לחם, because Joseph had stored food in the cities.

Verse 55



Verse 56

וישבר, a term used for trading in food and drink, as we know already from Yaakov having said to his sons, לכו שברו לנו מעט אכל. We also find the expression including the dealing in liquids in Isaiah 55,1 ולכו שברו בלא כסף ובלא מחיר יין וחלב, “come for water, even if you have no money, come buy food and eat, buy food without money, wine and milk without cost.”

Verse 57

וכל הארץ באו מצרימה אל יוסף לשבור, [dear reader please note that the author’s commentary consists of his reversing the sequence of the words לשבור אל יוסף, written in the text of the Torah. If the meaning had been as it appears from the written text at first glance, instead of writing אל יוסף, the Torah should have written מן יוסף, from Joseph. Ed.]

Chapter 42



Verse 1

למה תתראו?, the use of the conjugation hitpael, the reflexive conjugation here, is similar to its use in Kings II 14,8 לכה ונתראה, “come let us confront one another!” At that time King Amatziah wanted to show off his power to Yoash, King of Israel (10 tribes). Here too, Yaakov’s question למה תתראו, meant: “why are you (my sons) conducting yourselves in front of the other people in this land as if you had all the food in the world, whereas only they have to travel to Egypt to buy rations from there? 

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

מאין באתם?; he pretended not to know who they were.

Verse 8

והם לא הכירוהו. Joseph had grown a beard, something, which at 17, when they had last seen him, he had not yet had. Furthermore, the Royal garments were something they would not have associated with their brother. They did not recognise his voice either, as they had never heard him speak Egyptian. Joseph made sure that there was always an interpreter between him and his brothers as we know from verse 23.

Verse 9

ערות, places where the walls were breached, areas from which it would be relatively easy to invade the country.  The word ערוה is used in this sense in Chabakuk 3,13 ערות יסוד, “revealing its very foundations.” Another verse in which the word ערוה appears in a similar sense as here is Psalms 137,7 ערו ערו עד היסוד, as well as Isaiah 19,7 ערות על היאור”whatever is by the side of the Nile will be blown away, will vanish.” The fact that all the brothers were of exceptional build, always went everywhere together, made them distinctly different from other travelers so that Joseph pointed to that fact as being suspicious and accused them of being spies.

Verse 10



Verse 11

כולנו בני איש אחד נחנו, this is why we always keep together, not because we are spies.

Verse 12

ויאמר אליהם לא, כי ערות הארץ באתם לראות, if it were as you said, how could you not even leave one of you at home to attend to the needs of your father? Joseph said all this in order to find out if his full brother Binyamin was alive. As a result of his probing they elaborated that in fact they were a total of twelve brothers, one, the youngest having remained at home and one having been lost. They did not know his whereabouts or if he was even alive. We know that there were several questions and answers as when the brothers returned home and their father was reprimanding them for volunteering uncalled for information about their family status, they replied that the “man” had kept asking more and more questions. (compare 43,7)

כספיהם, seeing that the letter ס in the word כספיהם “swallows” the otherwise necessary chataf patach under it, the letter פ, normally weak, without the dagesh, has been given a dagesh in this instance. A similar example of this construction is found in the relationship of נסך, nessech, and נסכיהם, nisskeyhem.

Verse 13



Verse 14

כאשר שכולתי שכלתי, an expression parallel to Esther’s saying when she risked her life appearing uninvited before the king, saying: כאשר אבדתי אבדתי, “if I have forfeited my life, so be it.” (Esther 4,16)

Verse 31



Verse 32

It would be spitting and a shame for the Egyptians to eat with the people from across the river [ever hanahar], since those people were contemptible in their eyes, and the Egyptians were haughty, as it is written (Isa. 30:7), "I call this, 'They are a threat that has ceased.'"  Similarly (Gen. 46:34), "For all shepherds are abhorrent to Egyptians" -- they despised shepherds because sheep were contemptible in their eyes, as it is written (Exod. 8:22), "If we sacrifice that which is untouchable to the Egyptians before their very eyes, will they not stone us!"  That which is repulsive to the Egyptians and disgusting, if we sacrifice it before their eyes to our Rock, won't they despise us, stoning us in a shaming way, as we find (II Sam. 15:5-6), "Shim'i ben Geira came out from there, hurling insults as he came.  He threw stones"  He cursed David and stoned with dirt, in a shaming way.


Verse 33

וישבו לפניו, Joseph had given instructions to arrange the seating order in order of their birth.
ויתמהו, they were utterly amazed, seeing that they had all been born within a space of seven years and they could not understand how their ages had become known to Joseph.


Verse 34

ותרב, as if the Torah had written ותרבה. The meaning is that Binyamin’s gift from Joseph was far greater than the gift received by his brothers. A parallel construction to the word vaterev appears in connection with the construction of the Tabernacle ותכל, vatechel, where it means that the construction had been completed (Exodus 39,32).

Chapter 44



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

הבוקר אור, became lit, as in Samuel I 14,29 ראו כי אורו עיני, “see for yourselves how my eyes have lit up.” A reference to what had occurred already. Similarly, when Bileam referred to the tents of the Jewish people with the words מה טובו אהליך יעקב, “how goodly are your tents O Yaakov,” he did not refer to something that occurred just then, but to a phenomenon which was already well known (Numbers 24,5).

Verse 4

יצאו את העיר, similar to Joshua 6,7 עברו את העיר, “go through the city,” or Exodus 9,29 כצאתי את העיר, “when I leave the city.” A similar construction with pronoun ending instead is found in Jeremiah 10,20 בני יצאוני, “my children have left me.” [the point is the construction in the accusative, with or without the word את. Ed.]

Verse 5

והוא נחש ינחש, we have to assume that Joseph pretended to get his information about the brothers’ personal data by consulting his goblet. Perhaps a magic formula was hidden within the goblet. Some commentators say that a wise man of Joseph’s caliber would consult the goblet as to who had stolen it, seeing that the Torah quotes Joseph as speaking about איש אשר כמוני, “a man of my type.” [he had, after all, proven that he could see hidden things, hence his name tzofnat paaneach, the one who reveals what is hidden. Ed.] It does not say in the text ינחש בו which would suggest that he consulted the goblet, but נחש ינחש, independent of the inherent power of the goblet to reveal things to its owner.

Verse 9



Verse 10

כדבריכם כן הוא, you are truly all partners in all that you do. It is the custom of merchants to always attribute blame to one another. But I am not willing to go along; only the one in whose bag the goblet was found הוא יהיה לי עבד, he alone will be my slave.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

איש אשר כמוני, princes and ministers were in the habit of performing magic tricks as we know from Ezekiel 21,26 where the King of Babylon is described as standing at the crossroads in order to engage in this kind of divination. Joseph is saying that he knows who stole my property.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

כי כמוך כפרעה, seeing that Your position is one equivalent to that of king, I am afraid of your anger.

Chapter 45



Verse 1

ולא יכול יוסף להתאפק, up until now Joseph had practiced restraint in every one of his actions and words to the brothers. As we know from 43,31 “he restrained himself and ordered the meal to be served.”
לכל הנצבים עליו, in the presence of all those surrounding him; he now could no longer restrain his emotions. He called to all his personal servants even to leave the building. This is the plain meaning of the text.

(3) HE CRIED OUT.  To his servants.  
(4) HAVE ALL WITHDRAW.  My attendants from the house.  This is the basic plain meaning.

Verse 2

וישמעו מצרים, the people of the capital. Subsequently, the people in Pharaoh’s palace also heard the news.

Verse 8

כי האלוקים, “only G’d.”

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

פן תורש, so that you will not be driven from the land due to the famine. The root ירש of which the word תורש is a derivative occurs in the sense of disposing, expelling in Deut. 9,3 והורשתם ואבדתם מהר, “you will expel them and destroy them quickly.” It also occurs in a slightly different form in Deut. 7,23 פן תוקש בו, “so that you will not be trapped by it.” There the root is יקש. [as long as two of the root letters match there is a strong conceptual linkage between the two roots. Ed.]

Verse 12

כי פי המדבר אליהם, whereas up until now Joseph had addressed them through his interpreter, now he demonstrated that he had a complete mastery of the Hebrew tongue. The principal message Joseph wanted his brothers to take back to their father was that they had not only heard from others about Joseph, etc., but seen with their own eyes, heard with their own ears that he was unmistakably their long lost brother. His command of the Hebrew language would prove this better than anything he might have heard from a third party. Therefore he instructed them

Verse 13

והגדתם את כל כבודי במצרים ואת כל אשר ראיתם. The reason why he included mention of the honour he enjoyed in Egypt was to convince his father that he had no cause to worry if he moved to Egypt as a new immigrant, an alien; his son Joseph had the power to ensure that he would be treated with the respect and deference due him.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

ואתה צויתה, now I personally command you to take carriages and the animals to pull them, etc. This was an exceptional concession as it was forbidden to export a carriage without the express permission of Pharaoh. The Talmud Bechorot 28 Neither cows nor female pigs were allowed to leave Egypt unless their respective wombs had first been removed. [This was an Egyptian method of preserving their monopoly over the raising of such animals. Ed.]

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

כזאת, “as follows:”
עשרה חמורים, one each for his ten brothers. Even though Binyamin was also returning with them, he did not want to bother him [to have to look after the beast and its load. Ed.]


Verse 24

וישלח את אחיו, every expression denoting accompaniment (sending something along) is made clear by means of the dagesh, whereas when the word means merely “sending” it is in the “weak” construction without the dagesh. [The author speaks of the use of the root שלח, which may mean “to send,” or to “send with.” When it means the latter, this is noticeable through the dagesh in the letter ל. Ed.] In our verse it means the latter.
אל תרגזו, do not be nervous about robbers that you might encounter on the route. I have no hostile neighbours on any of my borders. This is also the meaning of the word רגזו in Psalms 4,5. The verse there implies that you should be worried not to commit a sin against G’d. If you are, you will not have to worry about any man-made hazards. The meaning of the same root in Deuteronomy 28,65 is also the same, i.e. as a result of your sinful conduct G’d burdened you with a heart which is constantly worried about all kinds of disaster that may befall you. This is part of the punishment you will experience for not having worried about ignoring G’d’s commandments previous to the retribution. Chabakuk 3,7 as well as Isaiah 32,11 make similar points. On the other hand, the same root used in Job 9,6 or when it appears in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Ezra refers to a state of anger. The word טרנבלד (old French for trembling) is the translation of כעס for anytime that word appears in the 24 books of the Bible.


Verse 25



Verse 26

וכי הוא מושל, do not be afraid to come to him.
ויפג לבו, his heart missed a beat, as he did not believe them. The meaning of the word is similar to Lamentations 2,18 אל תתני פוגת לך, “give yourself no respite.” [respite means stopping in that context. Ed.] The words וריחו לא נמר in Jeremiah 48,11 have also been translated as ”his bouquet has remained unspoiled,” [i.e. has never been disturbed, has remained inert, stationary. Ed.] 


Verse 27

את כל דברי יוסף. All the other things Joseph had spoken to them about which have already been recorded in the Torah earlier, such as that he wept while embracing them so that they recognized beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was their brother. את העגלות אשר שלח יוסף, at the instigation of Pharaoh himself.
ותחי רוח יעקב, seeing that he had remembered that Joseph’s final destiny was to become a ruler. Knowing that the kind of carriages sent by Joseph were not permitted to leave Egypt, he realized that only someone in the position of ruler over the country could have authorized such a  departure from Egyptian statues.

Verse 28

רב; my heart has stood still long enough during all the years I did not think that Joseph was still alive now I am definitely convinced
עוד יוסף בני חי, all the commentaries of others which are convoluted are way off. I, though a junior, say that the meaning of the line רב עוד יוסף בני חי וכי הו מושל בארץ מצרים is: “enough! I am satisfied to have heard that my son Joseph is still alive. The fact that he is ruler in Egypt is totally irrelevant to my joy. I would be perfectly happy without that additional information. I am going to see him before I die, ruler or no ruler.”

Chapter 46



Verse 1

לאלוקי אביו יצחק, He had become this because Yitzchok had previously built an altar there to this G’d when G’d had appeared to him there as we know from 26,25 where Yitzchok was reported offering sacrifices there as had done his father Avraham.

Verse 4

אעלך גם עלה, G’d meant that He would both descend with Yaakov to Egypt and also return with him to the Holy Land. The single expression גם serving as preposition for two activities, also occurs in Exodus 12,32 וברכתם גם אותי, when Pharaoh asked Moses to bless him as well as the Jewish people when they would offer sacrifices to their G’d.
(2) ALSO RAISING.  That he was buried in with his ancestors in the Cave of Machpelah.  
ישית ידו על עיניך, the word עיניך does not mean “your eyes,” but “your affairs, your needs.” Joseph will look after all of Yaakov’s needs during the years remaining to him in Egypt The expression occurs in Job 9,33.

יעקב ובניו, Yaakov is included in the number 70 as is evident from the plain meaning of the words in front of us, i.e. כל נפש בניו ובנותיו של יעקב ולאה הכל שלושים ושלוש (verse 15). This total of 33 presupposes that Yaakov is included.

Verse 9

מעט ורעים, seeing that Pharaoh’s question of how old he was appeared to Yaakov as being motivated by his extremely old appearance, he told him that he was not nearly as old as he might look, but that the various troubles in his life he had endured had left their mark on his appearance.

Verse 13

ותלה, similar to the word ותכה in Job 17,7 ותכה מכעס עיני, where it means: ”my eyes fail from vexation.” The letter ה is part of the root, this is why it has the mappik, similar to נגה אור in Job 22,28.in the word נגה. [indicates the letter is not a pronoun. Ed.]
ארץ מצרים וארץ כנען, however, people living further away than the people of Canaan did not come to Egypt to buy their food there. Either the journey was too long and tedious, or the famine was not as severe in their countries.

Verse 29

ויקרבו ימי ישראל למות, whenever a person is reported as about to make his last will and testament to his children, the introductory phrase is that he felt death approaching, i.e. ויקרבו. When Yitzchok was about to bestow the blessing on Esau, the Torah also prefaced this by describing that he felt himself close to death (27,1-20) [even if the word for approaching used there was not the same as here, i.e. ויקרבו. Ed.] He did say: “I do not know the day of my death.” In Kings I 2,1 when David gives his final instructions to his son Solomon, we also read the preface ויקרבו ימי דוד למות ויצו, “when David felt death approaching, he commanded, etc.” Actually, our paragraph commences with the words וישב ישראל בארץ מצרים, “Israel settled down in the land of Egypt,” (verse 27 in our chapter.) The words ויחי יעקב בארץ מצרים in our verse must be understood as a direct continuation of verse 27. The Jewish communities were not willing to conclude the reading of the weekly portion with the words ותהי הארץ לפרעה, “the land belonged permanently to Pharaoh.” This is why they added verse 27 as the final verse of Parshat Vayigash.
שים נא ידך, we already explained this expression on 24,2 when Avraham requested an oath from his servant Eliezer using the same words.


Verse 30



Verse 31

"And Israel bowed low": To Joseph, from the place where he was at [the top of] the bed. 

Chapter 48



Verse 1

ויאמר ליוסף, a third person told him. We find similar constructions, the subject not only not being named but not being identified at all, in verse 2 of our chapter, i.e. ויגד. The Torah does not bother to inform us who was the one that conveyed this information.

Verse 2

וישב על המטה. His feet touched the ground. This is why the Torah, when Joseph brought his children to Yaakov to be blessed, had to write: “he took them out from between his knees.” (verse 12) Another reason why the Torah mentioned these trivial sounding details, was to inform us that Yaakov still possessed the physical strength to pronounce all his final announcements with his feet firmly placed on the ground. It was only after he did not have anything else to say that he put his feet back on the bed in preparation for dying (49,33). That motion is comparable to what is described in Deuteronomy 22,2 as ואספת אל תוך ביתך, “bring it into your house,” i.e. The verb אסף, also appears in a similar sense in Judges 19,18 ואין איש מאסף אותו,”and there is no one willing to take me in.” 

Verse 3

נראה אלי בלוז, when I returned from Padan Aram. (Compare 35,11 אני א-ל שדי, פרה ורבה)

Verse 4



Verse 5

ועתה שני בניך וגו', seeing that G’d has given me the land of Canaan as a possession, I can make you the firstborn with the right to receive two portions of that land. This means that in effect you will receive the share of two tribes. Your sons will receive an allocation equal to the combined allocation of Reuven and Shimon.
עד בואי, before I arrived. We had been informed in 41,3 that two sons had been born to Joseph before the onset of the famine, i.e. before Yaakov came to Egypt.


Verse 6

ומולדתך, your children or grandchildren who will be born or have been born after my arrival in Egypt (during the last 17 years). על שם אחיהם יקראו, they will have the same status as their brothers, i.e. they will not each be considered as the founding father of one of the tribes, but בתי אבות, heads of family groupings within the tribe they belong to (Menashe or Ephrayim). All the seventy souls included in the count of people descending to Egypt with Yaakov, whether his sons or his grandsons, became the heads of such family groups. And this was of relevance when the land of Israel was distributed by Joshua. The Talmud Baba Batra 118 discusses this in detail, basing itself on Numbers 26,21 mentioning such families as Peretz and Chetzron, etc., as well as the members of the family of Elon and Ard and Naamon mentioned in verses 40 and 53-55 respectively in that same chapter. What applied in those situations would also apply to children of Joseph born after Yaakov’s arrival in Egypt.

Verse 7

ואני בבואי מפדן, on the same route after G’d had given me His blessing, מתה עלי רחל, while I was still on the same route, this is why I had to bury her there while on the way. There did not present itself an opportunity to bury her next to Leah in the cave of Machpelah. Yaakov elaborated on this now so that Joseph would not consider him as having been criminally negligent in not according his mother the kind of burial she was entitled to.

Verse 8

וירא ישראל, even though we have been told that Yaakov could not see well due to his age (verse 10), it is possible for people whose eyesight has become dimmed to recognise the silhouette of a person without being able to distinguish his facial features sufficiently to identify them.  When G’d told Moses that it was impossible for man to “see” Him (Exodus 33,20), He did not mean that man is unable to see any aspect of G’d. This is why the prophet Michyahu could claim to have “seen” G’d (Kings I 22,19) without this being a contradiction to what is written in Exodus 33,20. [thus invalidating King Menashe ordering the execution of the prophet Isaiah for being a false prophet based on his saying that he had “seen” (Isaiah 6,1) G’d. Ed.]

Verse 9

בזה;  in this kingdom.

Verse 10



Verse 11

ראה, as if the Torah had written ראות. We find a similar construction in Genesis 50,20 where the words עשה כיום הזה mean the same as if the Torah had written עשות כיום הזה.
לא פיללתי, I never “judged,” in my heart. The word פילול whenever it occurs describes judgment. One example is Psalms 106,30) describing Pinchas’ state of mind before he slew Zimri as ויפלל , describing the manner in which avenged G’d’s honour which had been defiled by Zimri. (Numbers 25,7) Judgment, דין, and נקמה, retribution, avenging, are two words describing opposite sides of the same coin.


Verse 12



Verse 13

את אפרים בימינו, in order to place him on Israel’s left side, (seeing he was the younger). 

Verse 14

שכל את ידיו, as if the Torah had written שכל, both the letters ש and כ with the vowels kametz, resulting in sachal, meaning something distorted, bent out of shape.
כי מנשה הבכור, and Yaakov was well aware even without being able to recognise the sons’ features, that Joseph would position his firstborn son on his father’s right side. Seeing that he wanted to place his right hand on the younger son, Ephrayim, he had to cross his hands to accomplish this.


Verse 15

ויברך את יוסף, blessings bestowed on one’s children are a blessing bestowed on the father.

Verse 16

ויקרא בהם שמי, may their seed and the seed of their see live.
וידגו, the root is of the same category as the ones which lose the last root letter in the future tense, such as בכה, “to cry,” ויבכו, “they will cry,” or שבה, “to capture,” וישבו, “they will capture.”


Verse 17

כי ישית, before he had started blessing them (Verse 7) Joseph had noticed that his father had crossed his hands. ויאמר יוסף אל אביו לא כן אבי, it is not correct to translate this line as: “you are not doing the correct thing.” If that were what Joseph had had in mind he would not have spoken so dismissively, but would have asked his father why he was doing this.What Joseph said to his father must be understood as follows: “the sons have not been positioned by me in the order in which you think, by my not paying attention who should be on your right, i.e. the eldest on your right, etc., but I have made sure that my firstborn is already on your right and his brother on your left. There is therefore no need for you to bend your arms, etc.” 

Verse 18

לא כן אבי, I did not do as you thought but placed my firstborn on your right and the younger one on your left. Yaakov replied that he was aware of this (verse 19) because “I know that you are a wise man and would see to it that your sons had been placed in the manner in which you intended them to receive their blessings. However, I plan to bless the younger one who is on your right with my right hand and I withdrew my left hand from his head in order to be able to do this.” להסיר אותה מעל ראש אפרים, and to transfer it (my left hand) to על ראש מנשה, to the head of Menashe. Whenever the verb הסר appears it is written in a sort of abbreviated syntax, the predicate which is supposed to follow it or precede it being omitted. Some examples are: Judges 4,18 סורה אלי אל תירא, the meaning being סורה משם לפנות אלי, “turn away from there in order to turn towards me.” A similar example of this is found in Genesis 19,3 ויסורו אליו, where the precedingמשם לבא, “from there in order to come” is omitted and the reader has to fill it in by understanding the context .

Verse 19

ואולם, “but, however.”

Verse 20

בך יברך ישראל, each Israelite his respective son.
וישם את אפרים לפני מנשה, he did this not physically, but by mentioning Ephrayim’s name in the blessing ahead of the name of Menashe. The expression (verb) שימה, or לשום respectively can be used with words (intangibles) as well as with people and tangible objects. A prominent example of it being applied to intangible concepts is Exodus 21,1 ואלה המשפטים אשר תשים לפניהם, “and these are the laws, judicial concepts, you are to place before them.” Or. In Deuteronomy 4,41 וזאת התורה אשר שם משה, “and this is the Torah which Moses placed, etc.” The reference was not to the Torah scroll, but to what was written in it. Also in Deuteronomy 31,19 the line שימה בפיהם, does not refer to something being placed in the mouth of the people, such as food, but it refers to the words in the written Torah being fed to the people as if food fed through their mouths.


Verse 21

הנה אנכי מת, although I am about to die, I am aware that after my death. והיה אלוקים עמכם והשיב אתכם אל ארץ אבותיכם, G’d will be with you and at the completion of 400 years predicted to Avraham will bring you back to the land of your fathers.


Verse 22

ואני, and what I say to you now refers to that land, נתתי לך, I have assigned to you, שכם אחד, a share על אחיך, over and beyond the shares which you will divide with your brothers in territory which I and my offspring will conquer from the Emorite in the future with my sword and bow, (in the wars conducted by Joshua). [The author, whose exegesis of the past tense used in Yaakov’s statement is most remarkable, now deals with possible objections that could be raised against his interpretation of Yaakov’s words. Ed.] Even though it is written in the Book of Joshua 24,12 לא בחרבך ולא בקשתך, “not with your sword nor with your bow (did you drive out the Emorite, but because G’d sent scorpions and the like against these people,” this verse does not contradict what Yaakov said here. Firstly, these scorpions did not cross the river Jordan, so how can we understand Joshua quoting G’d as saying “I have sent the scorpions ahead of you to drive out the two Kings of the Emorite, etc.” (same verse)? When reading the words quoted in Joshua before, we must put the stress on the pronoun endings of the words בחרבך בקשתך, i.e. “your sword, your bow. Joshua meant that although on the face of it appeared that your prowess with the sword and bow accounts for your successful conquest, your success was due to the merit of your ancestor Yaakov. The effect of that merit was equivalent to the effect of well trained archers and swordsmen using their physical weapons. 

Chapter 49



Verse 1

(1) YA'AKOV CALLED.  He sent for them.  
(2) COME TOGETHER.  For the seventy persons had increased during these 17 years and had become a numerous people, and according to the words of our Sages, to (six) hundred thousand.  
(3) WHAT IS TO BEFALL YOU.  With respect to their power and their inheritance.

Verse 2



Verse 3

כחי וראשית אוני יתר שאת ויתר עז, although it sounds as if Yaakov is describing more than one facet of Reuven, it is a single statement incorporating what writers call “poetic license.” כחי, my power, my economic might; We find the word און as also referring to money, i.e. economic power in Hoseah,12,9 אך עשרתי, מצאתי און לי, ”I have become rich, I have gotten power.”  Also in Job 20,10 the word און appears in the sense of economic power, וידיו תשבנה אונו, “his own hands must give back his wealth.”
What Yaakov is referring to is that although Reuven as the first-born was entitled to a double portion of his father’s estate, his conduct resulted in his forfeiting this advantage and forfeiting his chance of being the leader among his brothers. פחז כמים, having been unstable like water, you will no longer enjoy your excellence, i.e. יתר שאת, neither the rights of the first-born nor the claim to be king over the tribes.


Verse 4

כי עלית על משכבי אביך, for through your having mounted your father’s bed,  (you disgraced, etc.). Reuven having been deprived of his privileges as first-born has been spelled out more clearly in Chronicles I 5,1-2)  “He was the firstborn of Israel; but when he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph, son of Israel, so he is not considered as first-born in genealogy.”
יצועי עלה, the indirect mode עלה, “he mounted,” means “you were about to mount.” We find numerous instances in Scripture when a past tense is not really a past tense, such as when Avraham said to Efron that he had already given the money for the cave of Machpelah, נתתי כסף השדה קח ממני, when what he meant was that he had the money all ready and prepared. (compare Genesis 23,13). [Avraham could not have paid for the field at that time, not having wanted to buy the field nor even having made an offer to buy it. He would have considered it improper to ask someone to sell an ancestral field. Ed.]  

Verse 5

 מכירותיהם The reason why Yaakov used such a dual, pluralistic, mode of the word was the special relationship which existed between Shimon and Levi, a relationship almost like that of twin brothers, as if the term אחותיהם instead of merely אחים, would describe their mutual brotherliness. However, their special relationship appeared to concentrate on their doing something negative, i.e. they used destructive tools, weapons in the pursuit of their designs. 
Whereas the terms מכורותיך and מולדתיך occur in Ezekiel 16,3-4, describing close relatives in one’s birthplace, in our verse, the vowel tzeyreh under the letter כ converts this word into one that could have been written with a dagesh, i.e. from the conjugation piel, the strong, transitive conjugation, suggesting that these emotions were evident only when the two brothers engaged in a scheme of doubtful ethical merit. The construction of the word is parallel to Job 37,12 where the word מסבות, describes clouds in constant motion foreboding turmoil, nature at its most destructive. Examples of the expected vowel chirik becoming a tzeyreh instead, are found in Lamentations 2,9, as well as in Numbers 8,26, and in Psalms 74,18. In all those examples the addition of the extra “dot” next to the chirik converts the meaning into something stronger, more aggressive, more intense.

Verse 6

בסודם אל תבא נפשי, may it be G’d’s will that I will not feature in their plots. Every time we encounter the expression אל, al, in the Torah, it is a curse, a request, or a command. It would therefore be wrong to translate this word here as meaning “I have not been part of their devious plot.”
(2) KI IN THEIR ANGER.  Because in their anger. 
כי באפם עקרו שור, the word עקרו here has the same meaning as the word תעקר in Joshua 11,6, where G’d promises the Israelites that they will totally disable, hamstring  the horses of their enemies. 

Verse 7

ארור אפם, they shall not succeed to take revenge in their anger and to wreak destruction when it is vented on the innocent. Seeing that they abused their brotherliness in the past, I do not wish to be associated with their method of operation. Their close association is potentially dangerous.
אחלקם ביעקב, the tribe of Levi was scattered between 48 cities throughout the land of Israel and its various tribes, as described in Joshua chapter 21, so that the tribe of Shimon remained isolated from its close associate.


Verse 8

יהודה אתה יודוך אחיך, anyone who interprets these words to mean that the brothers ought to praise Yehudah is grossly mistaken. The reason that Yaakov transfers the status of leader of the brothers, and, ultimately, hereditary royalty to Yehudah, was not his excellence as much as his older brothers’ unfitness. Yehudah’s elevation to this status would be initiated by his own brothers by their own volition, not through his father imposing him on the rest of the brothers. (compare the end of our verse “and the sons of your father will prostrate themselves before you.”) In Numbers 26,20 when Moses appoints Joshua as his successor, G’d suggests that he on his own account transfer his mantle of leadership to Joshua, [although G’d could have removed it from Moses and then Himself have bestowed it on Joshua. Ed.]
יודוך, they will crown you. The word is abbreviated in its spelling, being the equivalent of יהודוך, (as in Psalms 45,18) Similar constructions [a letter being omitted, Ed.] are found in Kings II 6,27 where we have יושיעך instead of יהושיעך). The latter and proper spelling is found in Samuel I 17,47 i.e. יחושיע. At any rate, even though the word יודוך is derived from הוד as in הוד מלכות, “regal majesty,” the letter י is not an integral part of the word, but is added as part of the constructions known as חטופי פ'ה, the first root letter in roots commencing with the letter ה being shortened in sound. When we encounter to word הוציא, a transitive past construction derived from the root יצא, the first root letter of יצא has actually been omitted, the letterה   in הוציא not being part of the root, but substituting for the letter י of the root. The same is true of the root ישב and the transitive construction of that verb as הושיב. We encounter the same phenomenon in Exodus 15,5 where the Torah wrote ירה בים. In our case the root of יודך is הרה. [The author quotes more examples of this kind, which I think we can skip. Ed.] 
וישתחוו, in order to enthrone you.
בני אביך, Yaakov chose this formulation because having had four wives it was the simplest way. On the other hand, when Yitzchok (who had only one wife) blessed Yaakov, he spoke of בני אמך, “the sons of your mother” (27,29)


Verse 9

גור אריה יהודה, an expression similar to כפיר אריות, (Judges 14,5) the young, not fully grown lion is called גור, whereas the fully mature lion is known as כפיר as we know from Ezekiel 19,2 בתוך כפירים רבתה גוריה, “a young lioness crouched among the fully grown lions.” The young lion enjoys the advantage of speed and self-confidence, hence more aggressiveness, over an aging lion. It is not surprising therefore that when complimenting Yehudah, Yaakov compares him to a young lion rather than to a fully mature one who is already on the way to decline.
מטרף בני עלית, you my son Yehudah, seeing that after you have risen from dealing with the spoils of war you had acquired stature and were held in awe, have lain down like a lion, supremely confident that no one would dare disturb your rest. No enemy will dare to become the one to disturb your sleep and to attack you. This is the plain meaning of the verse repeating the word Yehudah twice in the same sequence. All those who understood Yaakov as referring to the sale of Joseph in this verse do not understand the sentence structure nor paid attention to the tone signs.


Verse 10

לא יסור שבט מיהודה, the position of royalty which all his 12 brothers bestowed on him, i.e. that they all prostrate themselves before him, will not be removed from him until Shiloh. Yehudah, i.e. King Rechavam of Yehudah son of Solomon who wanted to confirm his ascendancy to the throne in Shilo, which is very close to Shechem. (Kings I 12) [In the event, his stupidity in listening to inexperienced irresponsible counselors lost him most of his kingdom so that he ruled only over Yehudah and Binyamin. Ed.]
ולו יקהת עמים, the mass of the people, who under the rule of his father Solomon, had been tightly controlled, as we know from Kings I 5,4 now assembled at Shechem to enthrone Rechavam as described in Chronicles II 10,1  where the people had all assembled in order to place him on his father’s throne. We know that Shechem was very close to Shiloh from Joshua 24,1 and the whole paragraph following. The description in what is reported in that paragraph sounds as if could all have taken place at Shiloh. [seeing that Joshua refers to the people listening to him “in the presence of the Lord”, i.e. at the Sanctuary which stood in Shiloh. Compare Joshua chapter 18,1 for similar wording referring directly to a presence of the people in Shiloh, in the presence of the Lord, i.e. the Tabernacle which had been erected there.” Ed.] Furthermore, in verse 26 of chapter 24 Joshua also concludes by stating that all of the exhortations in the chapter demanding from the people to remain loyal to G’d and His Torah had been addressed to them at the מקדש ה', G’d’s Sanctuary. All this supports the view that the precise location was Shiloh, whereas the region in which Shiloh was situated was Shechem, hence the reason both locations were mentioned. These two locations are linked in one sentence also in Judges 21,19 as well as in Jeremiah 41,5. There was open space at Shechem around the famous oak located near Shechem. At that location a mass rally could be held easily. The people would pay homage to the Sanctuary in Shiloh from that vantage point, as it was in their line of vision. This exegesis refutes the view of the heretics, especially that of the Christians, who claim that the שילה spelled here with a ה at the end and the city known as Shiloh spelled in Scripture as שלו as in Samuel 1,24 (where Elkanah would make his pilgrimages and where the Sanctuary stood) are not the same, the one in our verse referring to the Saviour, while the one in Samuel being a reference to the town. Yaakov, as opposed to the view of the Christians, did not elevate the position of Yehudah to that of being a Saviour beginning with that point in “time,” but he predicted that after the death of Solomon, the high point in Jewish history, a decline would set in as documented by the 10 tribes withdrawing their support of a king from the tribe of Yehudah. 

Verse 11

אסרי לגפן עירה, an עיר, young ass, needs to be tied to a single vine to load it with many grapes
(2) TO A single CHOICE VINE.  ...
ולשרקה בני אתונו, a repetition for literary purposes, similar to expressions such as יהודה וישראל, when both words are references to the same people, or as the expression איש תחת גפנו ותחת תאנתו, “each man under his grape vine and under his fig tree” This expression which occurs frequently in the Book of Kings, etc., simply describes the economic affluence of the people, not that each man will own fig trees and grape vines. 
כבס ביין לבושו, after the grapes have been stamped on with the feet to squeeze out the juice and to store them in the wine-presses, the workers’ clothing has become stained in the process as described by Isaiah 63,2 מדוע אדום ללבושך ובגדיך כדורך בגת?, “Why is your clothing so red, your garments like his who treads grapes? The prophet continues there in verse 3:  “I trod them down in My anger trampled them with My rage. Their lifeblood bespattered My garments and all My clothing was stained.” After completing the process described one can drink the wine. This is why Yaakov continued with חכללי עינים מיין ולבן שנים מחלב. Who are the ones whose eyes are darker than wine and whose teeth are whiter than milk- the answer is found in Proverbs 23,29-30 those who linger over wine and those who go in search of mixtures of wine.”
סותה, as in כסות, a kind of garment

Verse 12

חכלילי, the redness of eyes is called thus.
ולבן-שנים, the result of drinking milk produces this whiteness of the teeth. We find a parallel expression in Song of Songs 5,1 שתיתי ייני עם חלבי, “I have drunk my wine with my milk.” Isaiah 55,1 describes a similar theme,בלא כסף ובלא מחיר יין וחלב, “(come buy). without money or any cost, wine and milk. “The word “ul-ven,” must be understood as if it had the vowels making it “ulavan.” When it is in a possessive mode, the grammar is quite in order so that it is ulven. In a similar possessive mode in Deuteronomy 32,14 we find “vachalev tzon,” describing “the chalav of sheep.”

(3) UL'VEN (WHITENESS).  Like "lavan" (white).  When it is in the construct case, one says "ul'ven," as from "halav" (milk), we get (Deut. 32:14) "vahalev tzon" ("milk of flocks"). 

Verse 13

לחוף ימים, the beaches of the sea which was sort of rubbing the shore, חופף. If you were to ask what good this was seeing the shore was so high that one could not descend to the water to buy merchandise from the ships, Yaakov adds
לחוף אניות, that he speaks of inlets where there are harbours at which ships can lie at anchor. There are no high cliffs there making making ships and their wares difficult to access. Yaakov’s reference to
צידון, a well known harbour, a center of trade and commerce, illustrates the nature of his blessing. In Isaiah 23,2 Tzidon and its traders are mentioned as having been a great trading center in the past that has been ruined by the Assyrians in the prophet’s time. This is also why Moses, when blessing the Jewish people before his death, (Deuteronomy 33,18) describes Tzidon in its heyday as a model for Zevulun, who will enjoy similar prosperity.


Verse 14

יששכר חמור גרם, he is not like Zevulun who engages in voyages with mariners to distant lands to engage in trade and commerce. He stays at home toiling his earth sharing the fate of his donkeys, his beasts of burden.
בין המשפתים at the outer edges of town, where the surrounding fields are under cultivation. We encounter the expression for tilling the soil as applying not only to oxen but also to donkeys in Isaiah 32,20 אשריכם זרעי על כל מים, משלחי רגל השור והחמור, “happy shall you be who sow by the waters, who send out oxen and donkeys to plough and spread the seed.” We find a similar contrast between these two tribes expressed in Moses‘ blessing in Deut. 33,18שמח זבולון בצאתך ויששכר באהליך “enjoy your departures (on voyages) Zevulun, and you, Issachar, enjoy your pursuing your vocation in your tents.”


Verse 15

וירא יששכר, he realised that to stay home and toil the soil leisurely was preferable, i.e. 
(2) THAT IT WAS GOOD.  Better than to venture out to great distances.  
מנוחה כי טוב ואת הארץ כי נעמה, and how such pursuits were very rewarding, (an expression also used in Deuteronomy 12,9 אל המנוחה ואל הנחלה) 
ויט שכמו לסבול, he accepted the tax burdens etc , imposed by the  kings of Israel
ויהי למס עובד, he dutifully gave part of his harvests  to the King’s tax collectors, as predicted by the prophet Samuel when the people demanded to be ruled by a king (Samuel I 8,14-15). This is the plain meaning of the above verse. It contains a promise of material wealth to both tribes, though each tribe’s wealth originates from the pursuit of separate vocations.. 

Verse 16

דן ידין עמו, those who explained this as a reference to Shimshon, one of the judges of Israel, have read the text only superficially. Did they really think that Yaakov, on his deathbed, would prophesy concerning a single specific individual who, moreover, fell into the hands of the Philistines and ended his life as their victim? Far be it from Yaakov to focus on such events at a time like this, even if he foresaw it! Yaakov relates to the tribe of Dan who is described as the rearguard of the Jewish armies in the desert both in Numbers 10,25 and in the Book of Joshua 6,9 where this tribe is described in identical terms. The fact that the rearguard is the most exposed section of the army which has to beat off any attacks from the rear, means that it needs extra protection by G’d. Yaakov says that he will enjoy success in avenging any unprovoked attacks on the Jewish people, i.e. their army. The words 
(1) DAN SHALL GOVERN HIS PEOPLE.  One who interprets this as about Shimshon does not know the depths of the plain sense of Scripture at all.  Did Ya'akov really come to prophesy about a man who fell to the Philistines, and whose eyes they put out, and who died with the Philistines, in an unfortunate matter?  Heaven absolutely forbid!  He prophesied specifically for the tribe of Dan, which was the after-guard for all the tribes.  And in Joshua (6:9) it is written, "and the rear guard marched behind the Ark."  And because they went, throughout Moshe's and Yehoshua's times, after the other divisions, and they had to combat all the nations that pursued them to cut down all the stragglers in their rear on the road [see Deut. 25:18], and to take vengeance against the nations, because they were mighty.  That is why Ya'akov said "Dan will effect justice for [yadin] his people -- he will take vengeance for his people.  ...
כאחד שבטי ישראל, describe this tribe’s warding off such attacks, similar to what Moses said in Deuteronomy 32,36 כי ידון ה' עמו, or in Deut. 32,43 דם עבדיו יקום ונקם ישיב לצריו. “He will avenge the blood of His people, for He will wreak vengeance on his foes.” David expresses similar feelings in Psalms 110,6 when he says:ידיו בגויים מחץ גוויות מחץ ראשו על ארץ רבה, ”He works judgment on the nations, heaping up bodies, crushing heads far and wide.”

(3) THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL.  He will take vengeance for them and protect them from pursuers, as in (Deut. 32:36), "Adonai will vindicate [yadin] His people, etc." and (Deut. 32:43), "For He’ll avenge the blood of His servants, Wreak vengeance on His foes," and as in (Ps. 110:6), "He works judgment upon [yadin] the nations, heaping up bodies, crushing heads far and wide."


Verse 17

(1) LET the tribe of --
יהי, may the domain of Dan act like a snake barring the way, i.e. may he be the one killing nations hostile to the Jewish people
ויפול רוכבו אחור, may his enemies fall before him (off their horses.)

Verse 18

לישועתך
 לישועתך קויתי ה', I pray to the Lord that He may save you and elevate you over the gentile nations.

Verse 19

גד גדוד, the troops of the entire nation of Israel will follow Gad who is the vanguard in the wars of conquest as we know from Deuteronomy 3,18 where Moses charged them with this task. On the return from battle, this tribe, instead of being in the vanguard, will be the rearguard, again the most exposed to enemy action. They will thus form a buffer for the Jewish armies at all times.

Verse 20

מאשר שמנה לחמו, a reference to the olive oil pressed from olives grown on his territory, oil used to fry, bake, etc., and generally to improve the taste of the food consumed by the nation. Moses paraphrases Yaakov’s blessing when he says in Deuteronomy 33,24 טובל בשמן רגלו, “that he will dip his foot in oil.”
והוא יתן מעדני מלך, the kings of Israel were in the habit of taxing this tribe by requiring them to hand over part of their oil harvest. Instead of using this oil in preparing food, they used it to anoint their bodies, as a skin lotion. The purpose of this was depilatory, to remove hair from the skin where it was not wanted. This function of oil is described in Menachot 86 as effective when the olives had not yet ripened beyond a third of their eventual size. Not only would this preparation remove hair at the root, but it would also improve the texture of the skin surrounding such hair. When Sarah, in Genesis 18,12 refers to her experiencing once again עדנה, this is the same word, and she referred to a youthful appearance of her skin. 


Verse 21

אילה שלוחה, his soldiers were as fleet-footed as gazelles. In Chronicles I 12,9 this is described as Naftali being  כצבאים על ההרים למהר , “as speedy as the deer on the mountains.”
הנותן אמרי שפר. When they would return from battle, they would be the bearers of happy tidings, being the first to announce the victory won by the Jewish armies. The word שפר, is a derivative of שופר, the ram’s horn; they would announce the good news by means of the appropriate blasts of the shofar. We have some proof of this in Judges 5,18  where Devorah in her victory song speaks of זבלון עם חרף נפשו למות, ונפתלי על מרומי שדה, “Zevulun is a people that mocked at death, and Naftali-on the open heights.” [they were the only two tribes that heeded Barak’s and Devorah’s call to do battle against Siserah, the commander of the Canaanite armies of King Yavin whose army was equipped with 900 armoured vehicles. Ed.]


Verse 22

בן פורת יוסף בן פורת עלי עין, the first half of this verse is not to be understood until we have read the second half. The only reason it is written in this manner is in order to help us identify immediately who is the subject in our verse. We have a similar verse in Exodus 15,6 where in the first half of the verse G’d’s attribute of employing His right hand is extolled before we are tolled how this is manifest, i.e. by the manner in which He destroyed the enemy. A very familiar similar construction occurs in Psalms 93,3 a psalm we recite each Friday night, when the psalmist speaks of נשאו נהרות ה' נשאו נהרות קולם, and only afterwards we are told that the rivers raise their voices in response toכי הנה אויביך ה', כי הנה אויביך יאבדו. The verse means: ”The river raise ther “voices” (sounds), O Lord, the oceans sound their thunder and their pounding.” All of this is in response to verse 10 in the previous psalm where G’d’s enemies are described as perishing.” In fact the psalmist in 94,3 asks almost despairingly: “how long are the wicked going to be allowed to carry on successfully before the Just can rejoice when they observe their downfall?” Here too, the words בן פורת יוסף describe an attribute, referring to the tall and handsome person Joseph, before telling us that all the maidens of Egypt were craning their necks to catch a glimpse of him, each one trying to admire his features, trying to do so from a suitable vantage point. He, whose exterior had appealed to the wife of Potiphar at the time, now became a household word in Egypt so that all the women allowed out of their houses tried to catch a glimpse of him. [I paraphrased the author’s words in this paragraph. Ed.] Joseph’s handsome appearance had already inflamed the libido of Potiphar’s wife,
(2) So here, BEN PORAT YOSEF: "A son who is fruitful and grows is Yosef." And over what does he grow?  
(3)  BEN PORAT ALEI AYIN.  HE IS FRUITFUL OVER THE EYE.  He grows and increases above the eye, [so that one needs] to look above eye level, [to see] his stature and his beauty. COLTS [BANOT; GIRLS] of Egypt. 
(4) WILD [TZA'ADAH; WALKS].  Each of them.  
(5) ON A HILLSIDE. [ALEI SHOR]. An expression of seeing, a parallel construction with "alei ayin," as in (Num. 23:9) "[I see them from the mountain tops;] gaze on them from the heights," for the Egyptian girls would march and walk to see him, as did Potiphar's wife and her friends, and as a result --

Verse 23

וימררוהו ורבו, they threw him into jail, 
ורובו, and they harassed him. The thought is repeated to lend it emphasis, as is the reference to the בעלי חצים, his enemies. We find the expression רביו and חציו used in Job 16,13 as almost interchangeable. The dagesh in the letter צ of the word חצים confirms that the whole word is used for emphasis, reinforcing the thought already expressed in the word ורבו which also has such a dagesh. If the word ורבו were derived from the root מריבה, quarrel, it would not have a dagesh¸ just as קמו from קום, or שבו from שוב do not have a dagesh. The word רב in the sense in which it is used here also occurs in Judges 11,25 as emphasised by means of repetition, i.e. הרב רב, when Yiphtach refers to the extreme hostility to the Jewish people displayed by the Moabites. There was no need for the dagesh on that occasion as the word has already been repeated to show the emphasis Yiphtach had in mind. The Torah, i.e. Yaakov, calls the evil fabrication that the wife of Potiphar used to indict Joseph חצים, arrows, a word used in the same sense by Jeremiah 9,7 when he says (of his own people, alas) חץ שחוט לשונם, מרמה דבר, בפיו שלום את רעהו ידבר וגו': “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, they use their mouths to deceive; one speaks of his fellow peacefully, while laying an ambush for him, etc.”
ורבו, from the root רבב, similar to the relationship between סבו and סבב, or רוני from רנן (compare Isaiah 12,6) צהלי ורוני יושבת ציון, “Oh shout for joy you who dwell in Zion.” The word רוני is a repetition of the thought expressed in the word צהלי, designed to reinforce that thought.
(4) AND SHOT AT HIM [VAROBU].  _____ in the vernacular.

Verse 24

ותשב באיתן קשתו, there is a certain heavy and strong bow called arbalatra which is seated on a strong wooden frame called purka, and which, if the archer pulls with all his might bringing his arms all the way back to his body, enables him to shoot the arrow over a longer distance. A weak individual cannot operate such a bow. We have to understand the verse as describing a scenario describing Egyptians shooting their arrows of hate at Joseph until he was imprisoned, bound hand and foot. Nonetheless, the same Joseph afterwards emerged and became king over his former tormentors. This was because his  קשת, bow, was stronger than that of his adversaries. He proceeded to imprison his enemies, as we know from Psalms 105,22 לאסור שריו בנפשו “to imprison (discipline) those who had previously demonstrated their hostility against him.
ויפוזו זרועי ידיו, he contracted his arms quickly remaining steadfast when he pulled the string of the bow and flung his arrows against them seeing that he was a powerfully built man, able to pull the bow all the way back. We do find the word זרוע used in connection with archery in Psalms 18,35 ונחתה קשת-נחושה זרועותי, “my arms can bend a bow of bronze.” The wording describes the tensing of a bow. A similar expression occurs in Psalms 38,3 כי חציך נחתו בי ותנחת עלי ידך, “for Your arrows have struck me; Your blows have fallen upon me.” [the reference is to G’d’s “arrows.” Ed.]
ויפוזו, leaping in a wild dance, as in Samuel II 6,16. Here the expression is applied to Joseph’s hand, arms. In Samuel the word כרכר describes parallel motions with the legs. The image conveyed by the word is that of twirling one’s limbs.
מידי אביר יעקב, Joseph’s victory was due to the assistance of G’d, the One Who proved Himself as the Mighty one to Yaakov, Who grants dominion to kings and princes. The expression אביר יעקב is a duplicate of what follows i.e. רועה אבן ישראל. We find the expression אביר also in connection with King Sha-ul in Samuel I 21,8 i.e. “Doeg the Edomite, Shaul’s chief herdsman, אביר הרועים. The reason why the shepherds are called אבירים is because their cattle, the oxen, are called אבירים both in Psalms 68,31 and 22,13....
(5) THE MIGHTY ONE OF YA'AKOV. A parallel phrase to --  ...
(6) "THE SHEPHERD, THE ROCK OF ISRAEL"  Similarly (I Sam. 21:8) "Saul's chief herdsman" (abir haro'im).  And also, shepherds are called "abirim," because the cattle and oxen are called "abirim," as it is written (Ps. 68:31), "the company of bulls [abirim] with the calves of the peoples," and similarly (Ps. 22:13), "Many bulls [parim] surround me, mighty ones [abirei] of Bashan encircle me."  ...
מידי אביר יעקב, Yaakov is reminding Joseph of who it was that is responsible for his exalted position in the world, none other than the רועה אבן ישראל, the Shepherd Who has provided generously for the entire family of Israel.
(8)  THERE the Holy One, blessed be He, caused [you, Yosef] to be -- 
אבן, Yaakov uses the word as meaning אב, “father, provider.” The letter נון at the end is extraneous, just as it is extraneous in such words as שגעון and עוררן in Deuteronomy 28,28, and just as the letter ם at the end of such words as ריקם in Genesis 31,42 and ותהי הכנם in Exodus 8,13 is superfluous. 

Verse 25

מאל אביך, all your bounty originates with the G’d of your father, and it is He Who
יעזרך, will assist you. ברכות תהום, refers to the subterranean sources of irrigation rising and watering the crops that are in need of such irrigation.
ברכות שדים, that the breasts will not be dry and the babies will not die due to insufficient milk supply.
ורחם. Also while inside the mother’s womb the fetus would not die prematurely. When the Bible speaks of curses, it uses the same wording in reverse. (compare Hoseah 9,14) תן להם רחם משכיל, “give them a womb that miscarries and shriveled breasts! Even if the fetus survived the pregnancy, make the infant die from lack of milk supply!”


Verse 26

ברכות אביך גברו על ברכות הורי, the blessings of your father Yaakov who has been blessed by G’d on the occasion of the dream with the ladder (Genesis 28,13), are more comprehensive than the blessings my own parents had received at the time. G’d blessed me with unlimited boundaries “you will branch out to the east, the west, etc.”
(2) TO THE UTMOST BOUNDS [AD TA'AVAT].  To the end --
עד תאות גבעות עולם, as far as the furthest hills of the world. The expression תאוה occurs in connection with the Israelites’ demand for a meat diet in the desert, in preference to or in addition to the manna. (Numbers 34,10) The term is also used to describe far off places such as לבא חמת in Numbers 34,8. Accordingly, the expression הורי may be a duplication of the expressionגבעות עולם , used here as well as elsewhere to underline a point the Torah makes. A similar duplication occurs in Deuteronomy 33,15 of the expression מראש הררי קדם and the expression ממגד גבעות עולם in Moses’ blessing “with the best from the ancient mountains, and the bounty of hills immemorial.” Both Yaakov and Moses employ practically the same wording in describing the vastness of Joseph’s blessing....
נזיר אחיו, the king over his brothers, the one wearing the crown, נזר.

Verse 27

בנימין זאב יטרף, Yaakov prophesies concerning the first crowned Jewish King, Sha-ul, member of the tribe of Binyamin. He would successfully deal with the enemies surrounding Israel as documented in Samuel I 14,47בכל אשר יפנה ירשיע, “wherever he turned he defeated them.” The tribe of Binyamin also remained loyal to the dynasty of David when the ten tribes split under Jerobam. When King Assa conducted wars against surrounding enemy states, Binyamin  supported him. The same held true under the reign of the kings Yehoshaphat and Chizkiyah, both Kings of the Davidic dynasty.
ולערב יחלק שלל. It is customary for wolves (who raid in packs) to wait with distributing their spoils until evening. Jeremiah 5,6 and Tzefaniah 3,3 confirm this.


Verse 28

אשר כברכתו, of what would be their fate in the future, as already mentioned with the words אשר יקרה אתכם “which will happen to you,” in verse 1 of our chapter.

Verse 33

ויאסוף רגליו, he drew his legs back into the bed, seeing that all the while he had pronounced the blessings he had been sitting on the edge of the bed as we know from 48,2 וישב על המטה, “he sat up on the bed.” Also while blessing Joseph’s sons he had remained sitting upright, as we know from 48,12 where Joseph is described as pulling back his sons from between Yaakov’s knees. G’d‘s fondness for Yaakov is emphasised by the Torah when it reports that Yaakov possessed this strength until he had completed the last words of his blessings and his instructions.

Verse 2

לחנוט, we explain this word as being part of the verse’s context, i.e. to embalm. Menachem, on the other hand, comparing it to Song of Songs 2,13 where the word means “was in blossom,” uses a different approach.

Verse 26

ויישם, as if the Torah had written: ויושם, “he was placed.” We have encountered similar constructions such as in Genesis 9,24 וייקץ נח, where it does not mean “Noach awoke,” but Noach was awoken.” Or, Ezekiel 47,8 the expression המוצאים, where this word is derived from the root יצא and may mean “they were expelled.” (the waters).
בארון, in the earth. [I presume that the author means “as opposed to a pyramid, etc.” seeing that ultimately his remains would be removed.” Ed.]
