<b>The sons of Kehos.</b> The Torah lists the descendents of three of Kehos’ sons—Amram, Yitzhar, and Uzziel—but not of Chevron. This was not because Chevron was childless, for we find in Bamidbar: “The family of Chevron.” The reason the Torah does not name Chevron’s descendents here is because they are never mentioned elsewhere in the Torah by name, however, the Torah does mention by name the descendents of Amram (Moshe, Aharon, and Miriam), Yitzhar (Korach), and Uzziel (Mishael and Eltzaphan).

Verse 1

<b>For I have hardened.</b> After no other plague does Hashem inform Moshe that He hardened Pharaoh’s heart. In this case, however, Pharaoh had already acknowledged that Hashem was in the right while he and his people were the sinners (9:27) and still we are told that he continued his sinful ways (9:34). Therefore it was necessary for Hashem to explain that He was the one that hardened his heart.

Verse 1

<b>In the land of Egypt.</b> This passage discusses the first of the commandments, i.e. the sanctifying the new month; therefore Scripture considered it necessary to specify that only the commandments mentioned here were given in Egypt whereas the rest were given upon Mt. Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting or on the plains of Moab.

<b>A night of vigil (or “awaiting”) for Hashem.</b> In this context the word <i>shimurim</i> means “awaiting,” as in the verse, “but his father awaited [the fulfillment of] the matter” (Bereishis 37:11). Hashem had been waiting for this night since the days of the Patriarchs in order to fulfill His promise to take them out of Egypt. 
Similarly, the B’nei Yisrael await this night every year in order to observe the Pesach festival.

<b>It is a food (<i>man hu</i>).</b> The phrase <i>man hu</i> is actually the Aramaic equivalent of the Hebrew <i>mah hu</i>—“What is it?” Apparently the same expression was used in Egyptian, the language B’nei Yisrael were accustomed to. Moshe recorded the exact expression they used to inform us of how it came to be called “man[na]”.

<b>Like wafers in honey.</b> In another passage we are told that it tasted like “cake kneaded with oil” (Bamidbar 11:8). The Sages explain that it tasted like honey to the children and like oil to the elderly. The simple explanation is that it tasted like wafers in honey when eaten whole, just as nuts taste sweet before they are ground. But in Bamidbar it is written that they “ground it with a millstone or crushed it in mortars.” Through these processes it acquired an oily taste, just as nuts and olives exude oil when crushed.

Verse 16

<b>So that we will be distinguished.</b> This is a new request. Moshe asked that he be distinguished in some way from the rest of the nation so that they will know that he is God’s prophet and will heed him. At the same time he asked that the B’nei Yisrael be distinguished from the other nations by having God’s presence among them.

Verse 17

<b>I will also do this thing that you have spoken.</b> Moshe would be distinguished as Israel’s judge and leader by the “radiance” of his face described later on (34:29). As for Moshe’s request that the B’nei Yisrael also be distinguished, this was already granted in v. 14.
