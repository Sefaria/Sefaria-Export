Rashbam on Deuteronomy



Chapter 1



Verse 1

THESE ARE THE WORDS. According to its straightforward sense, all of the items mentioned in this verse are place names, as we find is common for verses to provide identification after identification as to which it wants to explain where they are.  As in Lech L'cha (Gen. 12:8):  "east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east."  [In Parashat B'shalah:] (Ex. 14:2)  "turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon."  In the book of Judges (21:19):  "The annual feast of the LORD is now being held at Shiloh.  (It lies north of Bethel, east of the highway that runs from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.)"  And all the more necessary it is to specify the locations where the mitzvot were spoken, as it is written (Lev. 25:1) "The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai"; (Ex. 12:1-2) "in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you"; (Num. 33:50) "In the steppes of Moab."  Likewise here, it makes identification after identification.  And it similarly states and repeats and reiterates this matter when Moshe comes to elaborate the commandments (Deut. 4:45-46):  "these are the decrees, laws, and rules that Moses addressed ... beyond the Jordan, in the valley at Beth-peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites."  [And (Deut. 1:5) "On the other side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab,] Moses undertook [to expound this Teaching.]
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN.  On which "other side of the Jordan"?  
IN THE WILDERNESS.  On that "other side of the Jordan" that is on the side of the wilderness where Israel was for 40 years, which is called the "other side of the Jordan" for the residents of the Land of Israel, and not the "other side of the Jordan" that is the Land of Israel side, for it is also called the "other side of the Jordan" for those who are going through the wilderness where Israel was.

RATHER TO LOT'S DESCENDANTS.  Because he was Avraham's [relative/nephew], and all the more so you, who are Avraham's descendants.

Verse 20

(1) THE REPHAIM COUNTRY IS ALSO CONSIDERED like R'fa'im that was given to Avraham at [the Covenant] Between the Pieces, as it is written there (Gen. 15:18-20), "[I will give to your descendants the land of] the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim." This [which the Ammonites conquered -- vv. 18-19] also is considered like the R'fa'im, yet nevertheless, they [the R'fa'im] fell before them [the Ammonites], who conquered them. All the more will you be able to take possession of it [this land]. ...
(2) IS CONSIDERED. But the only land that is _called_ the land of the R'fa'im is the Kingdom of Og in Bashan, as it is written below (Deut. 3:13), "which is called R'fa'im country"; in other words, _it_ is the "R'fa'im" mentioned in [the Covenant] Between the Pieces, and thus, Israel will displace them.

THE MOABITES WHO DWELL IN AR. But about the other Moabites, it is written (Deut. 23:5), "because they did not meet you with food and water," and likewise those who live in Se'ir, as I have explained above (on Deut. 2:4).  But the Esauites who are called Edom went out to meet you with the sword: "Israel turned away from them" (Num. 20:21), and "they skirted Mt. Seir for a long time" (Deut. 2:1).

(1) ONLY KING OG OF BASHAN.  That is why the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (v.2), "Do not fear him."  
(2) HERE, HIS BEDSTEAD [ARSO].  The crib [arisa] of a child when it was a baby, "birsil" in the vernacular.  
(3) BEDSTEAD [ERES] OF IRON.  Because when he was a child, he was very strong, and in stretching out, he would break the bed of wood, and so he made it of iron.  For an adult man of sense would not need this.  
(4) IT [THE BED] IS NOW IN RABBAT OF THE AMMONITES.  It is still resting there, where he grew up as a child.  [It is] a wonderment that he was so large as a child.  But we do not normally deposit the bed of an adult man in a particular place, because he has beds in many places. ...
(5) BY THE STANDARD CUBIT [LIT.:  BY THE CUBIT OF A MAN]  Who has grown to his full height.

YOU CAME FORWARD AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN.  [Lit., "under the mountain"]  As it is written (Ex. 19:17), "Moses led the people out of the camp toward God, and they took their places at the foot of the mountain."  Whenever a high thing is in connection with a low thing, the high thing is called "above" and the low thing "under."  "He was sitting at the entrance of the tent ... standing above him." (Gen. 18:1-2).  Thus:  "under the mountain" because they were low and the mountain was higher than they.  And it needed to write [this] here, because it is written below (Deut. 5:22), "Let us not die, then, for this fearsome fire will consume us, etc."

Verse 41

THEN MOSHE SET ASIDE.  Why does the narrative interrupt Moshe's words, which are coherent and consecutive, and write this incident in between?   But since he had spoken at length up to now, and here it begins to explain the mitzvot, how he clarified this Torah.  And because it has to tell us in Parashat Shoftim (Deut. 19:2-9), "You shall set aside three cities in the land that Adonai your God is giving you to possess., ... and if (in the future) He expands [your land] then you shall add three more towns to those three.  And regarding the three cities that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded him in Parashat Mas'ei (Num. 35:9-15) to establish on the other side [east side] of the Jordan, he did not mention there [in Deut. 19] and Moshe did not command Israel [there], and thus it is written here, for Moshe had already set them aside, and thus he did not command Israel.

(1) BESIDE ME [AL PANAI].  It seems to me that this applies even if you believe in Him.  
(2) YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER GODS.  To practice divination with them, like the t'rafim of Lavan, who called them "my gods" (Exod. 31:30), and they were only to practice divination.  Similar is (Exod. 20:20) "Do not make any gods of silver alongside Me," even if you believe in Me.  Similarly (Exod. 22:19), "[One who sacrifices to a god] other than to Adonai only [shall be condemned]."

Verse 12

(1) KEEP THE SABBATH DAY. I have already explained in connection with the first set of utterances why it says here "Remember" and here "Keep."  
(2) AS ADONAI YOUR GOD HAS COMMANDED YOU.   In other words, what He specifies in the first set of utterances:  "For in six days, Adonai made heaven and earth, etc."  And because observing Shabbat and honoring father and mother are positive commandments, it says regarding them, "as Adonai your God commanded you," but with regard to all of the other utterances, which are negative prohibitions, it is not appropriate to say "as [He] commanded you," as it is written (Deut. 7:11), "command you today to do them," but we do not find any instance of "commanded you" not to do them.

AND IT DID NOT CONTINUE [V'LO YASAF.  JPS:  AND NO MORE].  No further loud voice like this was ever added, according to the plain sense.  For every instance of "yasaf" is an expression of addition [tosefet], [for example] (v.22) "if we [hear the voice of Adonai our God] any longer."  However, "wholly swept away by terrors" (Ps. 73:19) is from the same root as (Gen. 18:23) "Will You sweep away the innocent along with the guilty?"

(1) ADONAI IS OUR GOD, ADONAI ALONE.  Adonai, He alone, is our God, and we have no other god with Him.  And similarly in Chronicles (II Chr. 13:10):  "[the self-appointed priests will be priests of no-gods,] but as for us, Adonai is our God, and He has not forsaken us" like the house of Yerav'am, to whom you bow down."  
(2) ADONAI ALONE.  Him alone do we worship, and we do not combine, to worship another god with Him, even to practice divination, as I have explained above [see on 5:7].

Verse 5

INSTEAD, THIS IS WHAT YOU SHALL DO TO THEM ... SMASH [THEIR PILLARS].  Smashing [gidua] applies to a tree or to any long object, as it is written (Ps. 75:11), "All the horns of the wicked I will cut." 

Verse 6



Verse 7

IT IS NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MOST NUMEROUS OF PEOPLES [THAT ADONAI BECAME ATTACHED TO YOU].  People of spirit will understand, and will be surprised that Moshe our teacher would think that Israel would err in this matter [and think] that they are more numoerous than all other nations in the world, such that He would have to say, "It is not because you are more numerous," and also that He said "Adonai became attached to you."  And should Adonai become attached to them because they are numerous?  Rather, this is its meaning:  since it says above (v.1), "He dislodges many nations before you—the Hittites, etc., seven nations much larger than you," and lest you say, "We are more numerous than those seven nations, and with the power of our hands, we will expel them," it is not because of your numbers that you are [distinct] from the seven nations, and it is not because of your numbers that Adonai became attached to you, to clear them out; "rather [ki] you are the smallest" among all those peoples.  Rather, (v.8) "because Adonai favored you" -- because of His oath to your ancestors -- He will "dislodge" them before you (see v.1).

Verse 8



Verse 9

KNOW, THEREFORE, THAT ONLY YOUR ADONAI GOD IS ETC.  In other words, lest you say, since He has sworn to our ancestors to give us the land, why should we need to keep His mitzvot, since He will do what He promised anyway?  Regarding this, I say to you:  that if you do not observe His mitzvot, you will not take possession of the land, and He would not be violating His oath, for this is His way -- HE DELAYS [shomer -- JPS: keeps] and waits for THE COVENANT AND THE LOVINGKINDNESS, which He swore to your ancestors to fulfill, what He promised them TO THE THOUSANDTH GENERATION -- to that generation when they will be THOSE WHO LOVE HIM AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS.  And thus it says below, completing his remarks, (v.12), "And if you do obey etc., the LORD your God will maintain for you the covenant and the lovingkindness:  to you He will keep it, and He will not delay until the thousandth generation.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

THE LORD ... WILL MAINTAIN FOR YOU.  Because for a fit generation, He maintains the promise of faith with the ancestors, and if you do not keep the commandments, He will not maintain for you, but for a different generation.

Verse 13



Verse 14

AKAR.  Both vowels are kamatz.  It is similar to the following:  from hacham it says, "ishah hachama"(II Sam. 14:2); from shafal, "sh'fala einenah" (Lev. 13:21).  Similarly, from "akar" "akarah."  I have found the word [vocalized] this way in all of the texts from Spain.

Verse 23

MAKING A GREAT NOISE [THROWING THEM INTO  UTTER PANIC].  "V'hamam" must be [structurally] like "v'savav Beit El" (I Sam. 7:16), "shamam" from "sh'mamah" (desolation): "On Mt. Zion, which is shamem," and in the category of doubles [a three-letter root with the second and third letters the same], and it means that He raised His voice to make a great noise in the war to the extent of destroying them.  And if the meaning of the final mem were like "otam" ["them"] [i.e., a pronominal object suffix], it should have written "v'hamamam."  However, from the root heh-mem-heh, [the basis of] "yehemeh libi" (Jer. 48:36 [reversed]), one could say "v'hamam," [i.e.,] "v'hamah otam," as from "asah" [he made], [we derive] "otz'bi asam" (Isa. 48:5 -- "my idol made them"), and from "When Ya'akov saw [ra'ah]" (Gen. 29:10) [we derive] "And Ya'kov said when he saw them (ra'am)" (Gen. 32:3) -- "ra'ah otam."  And "hamam" from the root h-m-h would be explained "hamah otam."  And if you say that this [the actual word in our verse] should also be interpreted as "hamah otam," you can't say that, because the word himyon [making a loud noise] is intransitive:  "My mind yehemeh like a harp" (Jer. 48:36, modified) -- of its own.  If the action was done to something else [i.e., if it were a transitive verb], one would have to make it a stronger conjugation [a pi'el]: v'himem.  For example, "my body kalah [failed]" (Ps. 73:26) -- by itself; "my enemies kilam [has consumed them]" (Lam. 2:22) -- others, or "the LORD kilah [exhausted] his anger" (Lam. 4:11). [Another example:] "yishneh [debased, changed] is the finest gold" (Lam. 4:1) -- by itself, thus the soft conjugation [a kal]; but [done] to others it would say "v'shinah [changed] his prison garments" (II Kings 25:29) or "vay'shaneha [he treated her differently] and her maids" (Esth. 2:9).

THAT YOU MAY QUICKLY DESTROY THEM. In all your wars against them, you will prevail quickly and without effort, ramps, siege, or [campaigning for] a long time, and nevertheless, "you will not be able to put an end to them at once, else the wild beasts would multiply to your hurt." (Deut. 7:22). For I will not let you make war against all of them in a single year. "Lo tuchal" [you will not be able to] is an expression of warning, as in (Deut. 17:15) "you must not set a foreigner over you," [and] (Deut. 12:17) "You may not partake in your settlements."

Verse 25

 I LAY PROSTRATE BEFORE THE LORD FOR FORTY ETC. I PRAYED TO THE LORD AND SAID, ETC. Whoever is wise will pay attention to why it was necessary to repeat about the 40-day prostration. (see v. 18). Is it normal for Scripture to repeat a matter and to say, "Know that, when I prostrated myself before Adonai for 40 days, I prayed such and such"? It should have said this above [i.e., in v.18], and it would not have been necessary to go back and repeat it to make it known to Israel that "this is what I prayed." However, there is great wisdom here: you might say, isn't it true that, just as in the case of the great sin in the incident of the Calf, Moshe's prayer was efficacious and we were saved, so also in the Land of Israel, if we sin, the prayers of the prophets will be efficacious? Moshe said to them, "Prayer will not be efficacious in the Land of Israel. Currently, your sins are atoned for so that His name will not be profaned. For this is what I prayed (vv. 27-18): 'Give thought to Your servants, etc. Else the country from which You freed us will say, "It was because Adonai was powerless to bring them."' That is why you were not liable for death on account of it. But after He kills 31 kings and gives their property to you, then He will expel you and exile you from the land, for there will not be any desecration of the name, in saying to the nations that it was because Adonai was powerless." Instead, the nations will say that Israel sinned against Him, as is set out in Atem Nitzavim (Deut. 29:23-27): "All nations will ask, 'Why did the LORD do thus to this land? Wherefore that awful wrath?' etc., They will be told, 'Because they forsook the covenant that the LORD, God of their fathers, etc., The LORD uprooted them from their soil in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is still the case.'"

(1) THE ISRAELITES TRAVELED FROM BE'EROT B'NAI YA'AKAN, ETC. [Moshe says:] "And if you say to me, 'You said, "I also interceded for Aharon at that time" -- at the beginning of the 40 years -- but we plainly know that Aharon is dead, and, if so, what good is your praying?'" And Moshe said to them, "He died not at the beginning of the 40 years, at the time of the incident of the calf, but at the end of the 40 years, at Mt. Hor, right at the time they traveled from Be'erot B'nai Ya'akan, to which they came from Moseirot, as it is written in the travels (Num. 33:31), 'And they traveled from Moseirot, and they camped at B'nei Ya'akan.' And they went from there to Mt. Hor, 'and Aharon died there' and not in the incident of the calf." 
(2) AND ELAZAR HIS SON BECAME PRIEST IN HIS STEAD. In that there he donned his father's garments. And he died in a manner of greatness and honor, at the word of Adonai. And this is the plain sense of the text, for it does not say here, "The Israelites traveled from Be'erot B'nai Ya'akan _and_camped_at_ Moseirah," as I have explained in connection with (Num. 11:35) "Then the people set out from Kivroth-hata'avah for Hatzerot," for it does not say "and they camped at Hatzerot." So here, "The Israelites traveled from Be'erot B'nai Ya'akan _which_is_beside_ Moseirah," or, in a different manner, "from Be'erot B'nai Ya'akan _to_which_they_had_come_from_ Moseirah." And our Sages expounded from the change in language what they expounded.

(1) SINCE THE LAND THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER AND POSSESS IS NOT LIKE THE LAND OF EGYPT.  This is the structure of these passages:  You must observe the commandments of Adonai your God, because this land is better than the land of Egypt for those who observe the commandments and worse than all lands for those who do not observe them, because the land to which you are coming is not like the land of Egypt, where they do not need rain, and, good or bad, through the effort of irrigating their fields, they have bread.  However, the land of Israel, if you observe commandments, ...

That you are setting him free with what you are giving him: DOUBLE -- a duplication -- OF THE WAGES OF A HIRED LABORER for the service of SIX YEARS THAT HE SERVED  YOU that you are furnishing "him out of the flock, threshing floor, and vat" (v.14) in addition to the wages for the six-year term for which you acquired him, because it is for the sake of this that ADONAI WILL BLESS YOU IN ALL THAT YOU DO.  
	For the meaning of this verse is like (v.10), "have no regrets when you give to him," and (Deut. 28:55-56), "begrudge the husband of her bosom, and her son and her daughter" "from sharing with one of them," for grievousness in the eyes, and hardening of the mind, refer to the giving of money to others.
	And for those who are accustomed to explain "do not feel aggrieved" as referring to your setting him free after six [years] -- [do not feel aggrieved,] for he has worked a lot for you in six years, in other words, more than other hired laborers. this is foolishness.  For why should the setting free make you aggrieved?  Didn't you acquire him in the first place only for six years of service, as everyone knows that he will go free in the seventh?  Further, [if this were correct,] it would not have said "double the wages of a hired laborer" [mishneh s'char sachir] but rather "double the service of a hired laborer" [mishneh sachir].
	And some explain "double ... the hired laborer" as six years, because the normal hired laborer works for three years, as it is written (Isa. 16:14), "In three years, fixed like the years of a hired laborer, Moab’s population will shrink."  This is also nonsense, for elsewhere (Isa. 21:16), it is written, "In another year, fixed like the years of a hired laborer."  And the meaning of "like the years of a hired laborer" is "three years exactly, like the years of a hired laborer, where the year is calculated exactly."  

Verse 19

CONSECRATE TO ADONAI YOUR GOD.  In other words, treat it in the way of sanctity, neither working it nor shearing it.  And that which is said (Lev. 27:26), "No one shall consecrate it," I have explained that as no one shall consecrate it for another purpose.

Verse 2

THE FLOCK AND THE HERD.  The Sages explained this like the Targum [the pesah from the flock, and other sacrifices from the herd], for, according to the plain sense, they would bring their free-will offerings on the pilgrimage festivals, as it is written in the section "ox or sheep" (Lev. 22:27 ff., specifically 23:38) and in Parashat Pinhas (Num. 29:39).

DO NOT PLANT FOR YOURSELF AN ASHERAH.  No tree at all, so that you will not come to worship it, as is the custom among idolaters.


Verse 22

DO NOT ERECT FOR YOURSELF A MATZEIVAH.  For heaven [i.e., for God], to butn sacrifices on it during the periods when the bamot (high places) were prohibited, since you wll have a fixed altar after the apportionment [of the Land], as it is written (Deut. 12:8), "You shall not act at all as we now act here, etc.," offering sacrifices in any place at all, and as it is written in Chronicles (II, 20:33), "However, the shrines did not cease", and it explains there that the were sacrificing to Adonai only.

Verse 15

A PROPHET FROM AMONG YOU, FROM YOUR PEOPLE, LIKE ME.  Who will command you to do the commandments of the Torah, and not like the "prophet and dreamer of dreams" (Deut. 13:2-3) who will tell you to worship idols, and with respec to what is written (Deut. 34:10), "Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses," its meaning is as it specifies: (ibid.) "whom the LORD singled out, face to face."  But [as for] believing in the Holy One, blessed be He, there will be [ones] like him, and to speak the truth from Him, and not like the prophet who gives Israel "a sign or portent" (Deut. 13:2-3) to worship idolatry.

(1) WHEN YOU BESIEGE A CITY FOR A LONG TIME.  And you need to cut down trees to build battering rams, breastworks, and ramps.  
(2) BECAUSE YOU CAN EAT FROM THEM.  Since after all, they will be needed for food for you after you capture the city and it is yours.  
(3) AND THOSE YOU MAY NOT CUT DOWN.  Such fruit trees that are not support or protection for the city's population, such as those that are at a distance, those you may not cut down.  
(4) ARE TREES OF THE FIELD HUMAN TO WITHDRAW BEFORE YOU INTO THE BESIEGED CITY?  Every instance of "ki" after "lo" is to be understood as "rather."  _Those_ you may not cut down, but rather the tree of the field, by means of which a person can come before you into the besieged city, _those_ you may cut down, those close to the city, such that city residents fleeing from you can hide in them and enter the city, as it is written (II Kings 24:10), "the city came under siege" [i.e., the residents of the city entered under siege].  ...
(5) FOR IS A HUMAN [KI HA'ADAM].  Rather, a person is A TREE OF THE FIELD.  Rather, the tree of the field is a human, TO WITHDRAW BEFORE YOU INTO THE BESIEGED CITY.  It causes [enables] a person to enter the besieged city. 

Verse 20

(1) ONLY TREES THAT YOU KNOW ETC.  You may cut down a non-fruit-bearing tree, whether close to the city or far from it, to construct the siege.  However, a fruit-bearing tree you may not cut down if it is far from the city, but only if it is close to the city and prevents the army from approaching the city wall.  
(2) THAT YOU KNOW.  That you recognize.  
(3) UNTIL IT HAS BEEN REDUCED.  Until its walls are down, as it is written (Deut. 28:52), "until every mighty, towering wall in which you trust has come down."

(2) EXACTLY AS THEY INSTRUCT YOU.  For after all, REMEMBER WHAT ADONAI YOUR GOD DID TO MIRIAM.  For even though she was a prophet, and Moshe's sister, they did not accord her deference, but rather (Num. 12:14) "let her be shut out of the camp for seven days."

NOR CHILDREN BE PUT TO DEATH FOR PARENTS.  By a court, as it is written (II Kings 14:6), "But he did not put to death the children of the assassins, as it is written, '... there shall not be put to death ....'"  However, the Holy One, blessed be He, "visits the guilt of the parents upon the children" (Exod. 20:5) when they persist in the ways of their parents, and as it is written (Ezek. 18:2), "Parents eat sour grapes and their children’s teeth are blunted" -- to lose their ancestral portion.

The expressions oved and to'eh are one and the same, referring to a person who is exiled, as it is written (Ps. 119:176), "I have strayed like a lost sheep; search for Your servant" [and] (Jer. 50:6), "My people were lost sheep: their shepherds led them astray."

This [setting up an idol "in secret"] is one of two that are typically committed either publicly or privately -- they are idolatry and murder.  And that is why it specifies about each of these "in secret."  For regarding sins committed publicly, they did not come to curse, because the court will punish him for sins committed openly, as it says at the end of all the curses (Deut. 29:28):  "Concealed acts concern Adonai our God" -- He will exact vengeance for sins committed in private, for after all, they were cursed in the name of the Holy One blessed be He -- "but with overt acts, it is for us and our children ever to apply all the provisions of this Teaching" -- lashes, stoning, burning, the sword, and strangulation....

WHEN [KI] I CALL THE NAME OF ADONAI.  When I recount to you the mighty deeds that the Holy One, blessed be He, performed for you, and the benefits that He bestowed on you, and that He is righteous in what He does for you, then you also -- ACCORD GREATNESS TO OUR GOD -- acknowledge the truth.

Verse 4

THE ROCK!—HIS DEEDS ARE PERFECT.   This poem serves as a witness.  Therefore, the poem speaks about after retribution will come to Israel for their sins:  "The Rock!  His deeds are perfect" in all of the retribution that He has brought upon you.  
TRUE AND UPRIGHT IS HE.  As it proceeds to explain, that He has benefitted them in various ways, but they -- (v.15) "Yeshurun grew fat ... he forsook the God Who made him."

Verse 5

(1) HE HAS BEEN BASE TO HIM.  Israel has been base to itself, as it is written (Hos. 13:9), "You harmed yourself, Israel! You had no help but Me"  -- he caused destruction to himself.  
(2) NO [alt.: TO HIM].  In other words, not to another.
(3) HIS CHILDREN -- THEIR BLEMISH [BANAV MUMAM].  "Their blemish" is a repetition of "Israel has been base" -- the children of the Holy One, blessed be He, made this blemish on themselves, as it is written (Lev. 22:25), "for they are mutilated, they have a defect."

Verse 8

(1) B'HAN'HIL ELYON GOYIM [WHEN THE MOST HIGH CAUSED THE NATIONS TO INHERIT]. When He gave them landholdings [nahalot].

After the death of Noah, and in the days of Avraham, for it is written there (Gen. 10:5), "From there [in the verse, "these"] the maritime nations branched out ... each with its language." And you will find there that HE FIXED [hitziv; in the verse, "yatziv"] THE BOUNDARIES OF PEOPLES -- the sons of C'na'an were 12, corresponding to the number of Ya'akov's sons, who were 12. For you will find (see Gen. 10:15-18) that C'na'an and his 11 sons totaled 12, and it is written there (Gen. 10:19), "And the border of the Canaanite was from Tzidon, etc.," since all of this was for Israel, but it does not mention a border for any other descendant of Noah. I also found in a midrash as I have explained: IN RELATION TO ISRAEL’S NUMBERS. That C'na'an and his sons were so -- they were 12.

Verse 9



Verse 10

(1) YIMTZA'EIHU.  As in (Num. 11:22), "to suffice them."  The Holy One blessed be He was "at hand" for them (Jer. 29:14); the Holy One blessed be He supplied them. 
(2) HE ENGIRDED THEM.  With His angels, who guarded them, and thus established the poet (a "magen" piyyut for Rosh Hashana day 2): "may Your angel camp round about us."  And it is not according to one who explains it as a surrounding by clouds, as, according to the straightforward sense, there was no cloud except the pillar of cloud in front of them, as it is written (Ex. 13:21), "The LORD went before them in a pillar of cloud by day, to guide them along the way."  And further, the "yitz'ren'hu" ("He watched over him") duplicates [by parallelism] "y'sov'venhu."
(3) K'ISHON EINO.  The Holy One blessed be He protects Israel as the ishon protects its eye.  It is the flesh that folds over the eye (the eyelid), which is called "palpayra."  And because it covers the eye and darkens it, it is called "ishon," as in, "Guard me like the apple of Your eye" (as the ishon does to the bat ayin).  [It is the bat ayin that is the pupil], as (Zec. 2:12) "touches the pupil of his own eye."  It is what they call "fronila," with which one sees.

Verse 29

But if THEY WERE WISE -- the nations -- they would say, "HOW COULD ONE of us HAVE ROUTED A THOUSAND of Israel -- something that they used to do to us -- UNLESS THEIR ROCK HAD SOLD THEM into our hands because they had sinned against Him?"  And so it says above (v.4), "The Rock -- His deeds are perfect."

Verse 30



Verse 31

FOR THEIR ROCK IS NOT LIKE OUR ROCK.  This is what Moshe said: They [the gentiles] logically should have said this, for the Holy One, blessed be He, did this, and not the nations' gods, for NOT LIKE OUR -- Israel's -- ROCK IS THEIR ROCK -- i.e. that of the nations of the world.  And even though OUR ENEMIES ARE JUDGING and execute judgment against us, isn't this [ultimately] by the Holy One, blessed be He, since we sinned against Him?

Verse 32

FOR THEIR VINE IS FROM THE VINE OF S'DOM. In other words why (v.16) might I have reduced them to naught, made their memory cease among men were it not for the pride of the nations? For they -- they by rights should have drunk "from the vine of Sodom," so that no vestige of them would remain, as is the case with Sodom and Gomorrah, as it is written (Isa. 3:9), "They avow their sins like Sodom" and (Isa. 1:10) "chieftains of Sodom ... you folk of Gomorrah."


Verse 33



Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36

(1) WHEN ADONAI WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENT FOR HIS PEOPLE. [JPS:  FOR THE LORD WILL VINDICATE HIS PEOPLE.]  Then there will be vengeance and payback, for the Holy One, blessed be He, will work vengeance for his people.  Similarly (Ps. 110:6), "He works judgment upon the nations, heaping up bodies."  (2) KI YIR'EH.  When He sees.  (3) THAT THEIR MIGHT -- Israel's -- IS GONE.  (4)  HELPER [JPS:  FREE]. As in (Ex. 23:5) "You shall surely help" and (Neh. 3:8) "They restored Jerusalem as far as the ... Wall."

Verse 37

HE WILL SAY: WHERE ARE THEIR GODS.  And also the nations of the world will say, "Where is Israel's God?"  And out of respect for My name, I will save them and avenge them on their enemies.  For at the outset (v.26), "I might have reduced them -- Israel -- to naught, Made their memory cease" were it not for "the taunts of the foe" who would take glory in saying "Our own hand has prevailed."  But now, when poverty and trouble have increased for "the haters of Israel" [i.e., for Israel] so much that (v.36) "their might is gone," the idolaters will say "Our own hand has prevailed" and they say "Where is their God?"  Therefore I will take vengeance on them, to sanctify My name, which they are desecrating.

Verse 38

(1) [THE GODS] WHO ATE THE FAT OF THEIR OFFERINGS.  Israel's God.  
(2) SHIELD.   Let Him shelter you in his shadow [---]; let them take shelter as at the beginning, when (Deut. 22:37) "they sought refuge in Him."

Verse 39

SEE, THEN, THAT I, I AM THE ONE.  The Holy One, blessed be He, says this to the idolators:  "You say, 'Where is their God?'  Can they not see now when I am taking vengeance on you in front of their very eyes."

Verse 40



Verse 41

WHEN I WHET.  From (Ps. 64:4), "who whet their tongues like swords."  Similarly, (I Sam. 22:22) S-V-V:  "I caused [saboti] all the deaths in your father's house," and (Ps. 92:11) B-L-L: "I am soaked [baloti] in freshening oil."

Verse 42

LONG-HAIRED.  As in (Lev. 13:45), "his head shall be disheveled," an expression of undoing and wildness.

Verse 43

(1) ACCLAIM, OH NATIONS regarding HIS PEOPLE.  As in (Ps. 117:1-2), "Praise the LORD, all you nations; extol Him, all you peoples" -- believe in Him -- "for His lovingkindness is great towards us" -- more than towards other nations.  Therefore extol Him and believe in Him, and it will be great towards you as towards us.  Likewise here:  acclaim Him, praise Him, and worship Him, and thus He will do to you if you  fear Him and worship Him.  
(2) HE WILL CLEANSE HIS PEOPLE'S LAND.  He will wipe away His people's blood from the land by shedding enemy blood, as it is written (Num. 35:33), "the land can have no expiation for blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of the one who shed it."

And we also find in Psalms (68:18), "God’s chariots are myriads upon myriads, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them as in Sinai in holiness."   And in Habakkuk (3:3), "God is coming from Teman, The Holy One from Mount Paran.Selah. His majesty covers the skies."
