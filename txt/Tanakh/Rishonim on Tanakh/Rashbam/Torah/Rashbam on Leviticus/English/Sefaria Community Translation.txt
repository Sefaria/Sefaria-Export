Rashbam on Leviticus



Chapter 1



Verse 1

HE CALLED TO MOSHE.  As it wrote above at the end of the book [Exodus], Moshe could not enter the Tent of Meeting, etc.  Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, called him from within the Tent of Meeting.  So this is Scripture means:  "He called to Moshe from the Tent of Meeting, and He spoke to him, saying."  "From the Tent" refers back to "He called," as in (Ex. 19:3), "And Adonai called to him from the mountain, saying."  And he heard the voice speaking from the Tent of Meeting (see Num. 7:89) -- from the Tent of Meeting he heard the voice.  "God called to him from out of the bush, saying" (Ex. 3:4).  The duplicative expression "He spoke" (Lev. 1:1), as I explained in Parashat Noah, is, just as it says (Num. 8:2), "Speak to Aharon and say," so it says "He spoke to Moshe, saying" (Lev. 1:1) -- [saying] to Moshe.

Verse 2



Verse 3

(1) IF [AN OFFERING IS] A BURNT OFFERING.  That is, that when he undertook to bring it, he used this term, and below (3:1), it explains, "If [his offering is] a sacrifice of well-being."
(2) TO BE ACCEPTABLE ON HIS BEHALF.  If he offered it male, without blemish, and at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, then it will be acceptable on his behalf.  However, with respect to a sick one or one with a blemish, it is written (Mal. 1:8), "Will he accept you? Will he show you favor?"  And similarly (Mal. 1:10), "I will accept no offering from you."

Verse 4



Verse 5

(1) THEY SHALL OFFER [V'HIKRIVU; literally, bring close].  Receiving the blood [in a vessel] and bringing it [to the altar] in order to dash it against the altar.  And our Sages also explained it this way.  
(2) AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING.  I.e., not the [gold] altar that is inside the Tent of Meeting.

Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2


(2) TOKEN PORTION [AZKARATAH]. This is an ordinary expression of remembrance, i.e., with respect to the frankincense, because of the aroma that rises. It is likewise written (Isa. 66:3), "mazkir l'vonah" [JPS: offer incense], and similarly (Lev. 24:7), "which is to be a token offering for the bread." The kinds of m'nahot that are mentioned here are explained in [Tractate] M'nahot: how many loaves, how much frankincense, and how much oil in each, and what is a "mah'bat" and what is a "marheshet." "Marheshet" is a deep pan whose contents vibrate, but a mahbat is not deep, and both of them yield matza, as is said in Parashat Tzav (Lev. 6:7-10).

(1) OFFERING OF CHOICE PRODUCTS [REISHIT].  The two breads on Shavu'ot, which are called (Lev. 23:16) "an offering of new grain," and the first fruits, which are specified in Parashat Ki Tavo (Deut. 26:2).

Chapter 3



Chapter 4



Verse 1



Verse 2

(1) THINGS NOT TO BE DONE.  For all negative commandments punishable by karet, the Sages explained in [Tractates] K'ritot and Horayot, excluding Pesah and circumcision, which are positive commandments.  (2) ONE OF THEM [Lit. of one of them].  The Sages explained, even a portion of one of them, such as "Shem" from "Shim'on."

Verse 3

SO THAT BLAME FALLS UPON THE PEOPLE.  The Sages interpreted this as saying that the anointed priest is analogous to the community, in Horayot.  However, according to the plain sense, the implication is that since, with respect to the priests, it says (Deut. 33:10), "They shall teach Your laws to Jacob, And Your instructions to Israel," and all the more so with respect to the High Priest, who is the expert for the multitudes:  If the anointed priest sins, in his expounding, such that the people sin with him, then "he shall offer for the sin etc."

IN FRONT OF THE CURTAIN.  According to the plain sense, in front of the curtain of the Sanctuary, the curtain that separates the Holy from the Holy of Holies.  And the reason that, there (v.6), it specifies "in front of the curtain of the Shrine" is to indicate that the sprinkling is to be done towards the middle of the curtain from the outside, opposite the Holy Ark, which is inside.

Verse 22

(1) IN CASE IT IS THE CHIEFTAIN WHO SINS. This is like (Esther 6:8), "and on whose head [i.e. the horse's head] a royal diadem has been set" (JPS), which is as if it said, "and a royal diadem that has been placed on his [i.e., the king's] head." ...
(2) THE COMMANDMENTS OF ADONAI HIS GOD. In other words, if he is God-fearing and did not act intentionally but negligently.


Verse 23

OR [THE SIN] IS MADE KNOWN.  It is as if it said "If [the sin] is made known" -- that is the standard interpretation.  But I say [it means] "or it is made known by others."

Verse 9

HE SHALL SPRINKLE SOME OF THE BLOOD OF THE SIN OFFERING.  He holds the body and sprinkles from afar, and he squeezes out the remainder.  However, in the case of a burnt offering of a bird, there is no sprinkling, but rather (Lev. 1:15), "its blood shall be drained out."

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

[HAS ACQUIRED GUILT] FROM ONE OF THESE.  He has heard a public imprecation [v.1], or an uttered oath [v.4], or impurity of the sanctuary or of sacred food [vv. 2-3].

Verse 14



Verse 15

ABOUT ANY OF THE LORD’S SACRED THINGS. He has benefited from the holy thing, and this [sacrifice] is the asham m'ilot [guilt offering for misappropriation].

Verse 16



Verse 17

AND HE DOES NOT KNOW BUT FEELS GUILTY.  This refers to the asham talui [guilt of uncertainty], as it says (v.18), "the error that he committed unwittingly."

Verse 18

UNWITTINGLY.  When forbidden fat has been confused with permitted fat, and he ate it not knowing that there was forbidden fat there, but afterward, when he heard that what he ate might have been forbidden fat or permitted fat, "he shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock ... as a guilt offering" until he knows for certain that it was forbidden fat that he ate, and then he shall bring a sin offering.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

AND HE DEALS DECEITFULLY WITH HIS FELLOW, ETC.  This section  deals with the asham g'zeilot [guilt offering for theft].

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

WHEN HE REALIZES HIS GUILT.  When he confessed, making repentance for his sinning regarding any of the matters mentioned above -- a pledge, a theft, an oppression, or a lost object.

Verse 12

IF HE OFFERS IT FOR THANKSGIVING.  That he makes his vow in terms of "thanksgiving" [todah] and does not mention the term "well-being" [sh'lamim].  The standard thanksgiving is that one brings a sacrifice because one has been saved from one's troubles, as the Sages said, "There are four who are required to give thanks."  And our Rabbis specified that the total number of loaves is 40, and how much oil, and how many tenths [of an efah] of flour.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

(1) IF [the sacrifice] IS A VOTIVE OR A FREEWILL OFFERING. That he says, "I hereby take on myself a sh'lamim," which is an expression of an oath and repayment, as I have explained above, in other words, that it is not a todah, but a votive. 
(2) ON THE DAY THAT HE OFFERS IT. On the day when he has already offered his sacrifice; he may eat after the offering.

Verse 17



Verse 18

IF ANY OF IT IS EATEN.  The Sages uprooted this from its straightforward meaning, and explained it as referring to someone who plans, while doing any of the four sacrificial activities -- while slaughtering, while bringing the blood, while collecting [the blood], or while sprinkling [the blood] -- to eat from his sacrifice on the third day.

THOSE SHALL BE THE PERQUISITES [LIT.:  ANOINTING PASTE] OF AHARON AND THE PERQUISITES OF HIS SONS.  The compensation for the anointing of Aharon and his sons, as it is said in Parashat Tzav: "the skin of the burnt offering" (7:8), the meat of the sin offering and of the guilt offering (6:19, 7:7), the meat of the thanksgiving sacrifice (7:12-14), the breast and thigh of the offering of well-being (7:29-32), and the leftover portion of the flour offering (7:9).

Chapter 8



Chapter 9



Chapter 10



Verse 1

(1) NOW AHARON’S SONS NADAV AND AVIHU EACH TOOK.  Already, before the fire went forth from before Adonai, they had each taken their firepans to offer incense inside on the gold altar, because the morning incense offering precedes the disposal of the remains of the previous night's [animal] sacrifice.  And each put extraneous fire, which Moshe had not commanded them for this day, for even though regarding other days it is written (Lev. 1:7), "The sons of Aharon the priest shall put fire on the altar," on this day, Moshe did not command and did not want themto bring mundane fire, because they were expecting the descent of supernal fire, and it wouold not be good on this day to bring this, in order to sanctify the name of Heaven, that everyone would know that fire had come from the heavens, as Eliyahu said (I Kings 18:25), "but apply no fire," because he wanted to sanctify the name of Heaven through the descent of the fire from above. 


Verse 2

(1) AND FIRE CAME FORTH FROM ADONAI AND CONSUMED THEM. This is the same "fire came forth" as the first verse [9:24].  As I explained in connection with (Exod. 19:8, 9), "And Moshe brought back the people’s words," and similarly (Jud. 17:3, 4), "He returned the silver to his mother," which is written twice in connection with Michah's idol, both of them being a single event.  Likewise here, both verses are one event.  When the fire went out and consumed the peace offerings on the outer altar, when Aharon's sons took and offered extraneous fire on the inner altar.
(2) FIRE CAME FORTH FROM ADONAI.  To burn the incense inside initially, and it struck Aharon's sons there and they died.  And afterwards, it went out from there and reached the outer altar and consumed the burnt offering.  
(3) THEY DIED AT THE INSTANCE OF ADONAI.  And immediately, when Aharon heard, he wanted to leave aside the service and to mourn for his sons.  

Verse 3

(1) THEN MOSHE SAID TO AHARON. Neither mourn nor cry, nor forsake the service, for this that I am telling you is WHAT ADONAI SAID ...: THROUGH THOSE NEAR TO ME I SHOW MYSELF HOLY -- through the High Priests, who are close to Me, to serve Me, I want to be sancrified and not that My name and My service should be profaned.  For this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me (Lev. 21:10, 12), "The priest who is exalted above his fellows, ... shall not bare his head or rend his vestments, etc.  He shall not go outside the sanctuary and profane the sanctuary of his God."  Thus, if he does not go out, he sanctifies.  And there is no earlier and later in the Torah.  Therefore, do not forsake the service, since you are the High Priest, and do not leave and do not profane; rather, let the Holy One, blessed be He, and His service be sanctified through you. 
(2) AND I GAIN GLORY BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE.  In this consists the glory for the Divine Presence, that he see his sons die, yet forsake his mourning in favor of the service of his Creator.  ...
(3) AND AHARON WAS SILENT.  From his mourning, and he did not cry or mourn.  And we find thus with Yehezk'el (24:16-17), "Oh mortal, I am about to take away the delight of your eyes from you through pestilence; ... Moan softly; observe no mourning for the dead."  
(4) Likewise here, he WAS SILENT rather than what he wanted to do, which was to mourn and cry.  And this is moral and the true plain meaning.  But the Aggada that says that Moshe was consoling Aharon regarding what the Holy One, blessed be He, had said to him (Exod. 29:43) -- "'It shall be sanctified by My Presence,' I was under the understanding that it would be either you or I; now you see that they are greater than you or I."  This is not according to the plain sense -- would the Holy One, blessed be He, tell Moshe, "Make for me a Mishkan and on the same day the greatest of you shall die"?

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

DO NOT BARE YOUR HEADS [let your hair grow disheveled].  This is what he said to Elazar and Itamar:  "Even though you are ordinary priests, and are not commanded regarding baring heads and rending garments, for that is for the High Priest and not for ordinary priests, you are today like the High Priest for the future.  Why?

Verse 7

FOR ADONAI'S ANOINTING [OIL] IS UPON YOU.  You are anointed anew along with your father, and this rationale is written with respect to the High Priest (Lev. 21:10-12):  "He shall not bare his head, etc. He shall not go outside the sanctuary and profane the sanctuary of his God, for upon him"  will be "the distinction of the anointing oil of his God; I am Adonai."

Verse 16

THE GOAT OF SIN OFFERING.  The Sages explained that this is the goat of Rosh Hodesh, which is sanctified permanently, but the goat of the community (Lev. 9:3) and the goat of Nahshon (Num. 7:1-17) were consumed.

Verse 17

TO REMOVE THE GUILT OF THE COMMUNITY.  The impurity of the sanctuary and its appurtenances, as is explained in Tractate Sh'vu'ot.

Verse 18

SINCE ITS BLOOD WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE SANCTUARY INSIDE.  I.e., in the heichal, for all inside sin offerings are burnt, as it is written (Lev. 6:23), "But no sin offering may be eaten from which any blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting for expiation in the sanctuary; any such shall be consumed in fire."  But this sin offering is an outside one.

Verse 19

(1) SEE, THIS DAY THEY BROUGHT THEIR SIN OFFERING AND THEIR BURNT OFFERING.  This refers to the burnt offering and the sin offering of Aharon and his sons, as it is written above (Lev. 9:2), "Take a calf of the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish," and the sons assisted Aharon in the collection of the blood, as is said above.  And this is what Aharon said:  Why did you get angry at my sons?  Haven't my sons and I brought on this day our sacrifices through which they were inaugurated into the service, yet, in the midst of this great thing, a great distress has come upon us?  
(2) SUCH THINGS HAVE BEFALLEN ME.  And how can I eat a sin offering of the highest sanctity today when our joy has been ruined and sullied?  This is analogous to the shame of a bride who whored under the huppah.

Chapter 11



Verse 1

SAYING TO THEM. To Moshe and Aharon.  This provides proof for every instance of "leimor" that is written in the phrase "Adonai spoke to Moshe [leimor]" -- that its meaning is "saying to Moshe.  And because above, the word came to Aharon alone, it says here "saying to them" -- to both of them.  

Verse 2



Verse 3

(1) HAS TRUE HOOFS [MAFRESET PARSA].  A single toenail, like a shoe, and not [plural] toenails, on each toe, like the rabbit and the rock-badger.  ...
(2) WITH CLEFTS THROUGH THE FOOT [V'SHOSA'AT SHESA]"  The par'sa [hoof] is divided in two, not a single, complete hoof as with the horse and the ass.  And according to the plain sense of the Scripture, and a rebuttal of the sectarians, all domestic and wild animals, birds, fish, and locust species, and crawling creatures that the Holy One, blessed be He, forbade to Israel are disgusting and disordered, and heat the body, and therefore, they are called "impure" [t'mei'im].  And even expert doctors say so.  And even the Talmud:  "Idolaters who eat vermin and crawlers, their bodies heat up."  
(3) CHEWS THE CUD [MA'ALEH GEIRAH].  It brings up its food in its throat [gargeret] after the eating.  

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

DO NOT TOUCH THEIR CARCASSES.  At a time when you need to handle a holy object or to eat sanctified food, as it is written (Exod. 30:29), "Anyone who touches them shall be consecrated" -- must consecrate himself.  Likewise ritual appurtenances, likewise the altar, likewise the flesh of a sin offering.  Regarding all of them it is written, "Anyone who touches them shall be consecrated" -- he must consecrate and purify himself first, for if he touches the carcass or the other impure things written in the Torah, he must consecrate and purify himself and immerse first, before touching a holy object.

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

BY THESE YOU WILL BE MADE IMPURE.  if you touch their carcasses.   And it proceeds to explain which are the impure beasts.

Verse 25



Verse 26

ANIMAL.  Even if it HAS TRUE HOOVES, but, like the horse and the ass, it does not have a CLEFT that is truly split, or IT DOES NOT CHEW ITS CUD, WHOEVER TOUCHES THEM, whether alive or slaughtered [shall be impure.]  It does not specify "dead" here, but with respect to pure species, it says (v.39), "If an animal that you may eat has died, [anyone who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening]" -- specifically one that dies [naturally], but one that is slaughtered is pure, even if it [is found to have been] mortally injured."

Verse 27



Verse 28

ANYONE WHO CARRIES.  Who moves it from its place, even without touching it.  However, if they load it on his shoulder, and he neither touches it nor moves from his place, he is not impure; thus we have learned in Tractate Zavim.  And even a dead animal that is laid on a bier and there is paper under the [the animal] separating it from the garments under it, they are pure, for a dead animal communicates impurity [by carrying] only if the carrying involves moving, as we learn there.  And the Targum Y'rushalmi, "nosei" is translated "mesit" [moves].

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

(1) ANY VESSEL OF WOOD.  But not a vessel of stone or of earth.  
(2) SACK.  A garment of goat hair.  
(3) INSIDE OF WHICH WORK CAN BE DONE [JPS:  THAT CAN BE PUT TO USE].  Excluding the use of covering another vessel, for nothing can be done inside such as these.

Verse 33



Verse 34

IT SHALL BECOME IMPURE IF IT CAME IN CONTACT WITH WATER.  One who wishes to provide a rationale for mitzvot according to the ways of the world, and to refute the sectarians [could say as follows:]  The Holy One, blessed be He, did not attach impurity to kinds of food and drink until one has prepared them to be eaten.  And the supplying of water is the beginning of their preparation and the essence of mentally considering them to be fit for consumption.

Verse 35



Verse 36

HOWEVER, A SPRING OR CISTERN.  According to the plain sense, water collected in the ground is not susceptible of impurity.  Rather, as stated above (v.34), "any liquid that may be drunk, shall become impure if it was inside any vessel."

Verse 37

(1) THAT IS SOWN in the ground IS PURE.  Anything [growing thing] that is connected to the ground is not susceptible to impurity.  
(2) ZERA ZEROA [JPS: SEED GRAIN].  Seed of plants [zer'onim], as in (Dan. 1:12) "giving us legumes [zero'im] to eat."  In Daniel is the plural form; "zeroa" is the singular form.

Verse 38



Verse 39

(1) IF AN ANIMAL THAT YOU MAY EAT HAS DIED [i.e., NATURALLY], ETC.  But if it is ritually slaughtered, it is not a nevelah [a carcass that conveys impurity] even if it is found [after being slaughtered] to be a t'reifah [having an internal organ defect making it unfit to eat].  However, [the Torah] does not mention [naturally] dying with respect to an animal that is impure [i.e., a species not permitted for eating], since even if it is ritually slaughtered, it is a nevelah and conveys impurity.  
(2) FROM AMONG [MIN] THE ANIMALS.  ["Min" implies diminution:]  Some [dead] animals convey impurity and some do not -- this t'refah that has been ritually slaughtered is pure and does not become a nevelah.

Verse 40

ONE WHO EATS OF ITS CARCASS.  Our Sages explained, this [comes to establish] a legal threshold quantity -- that if one carries the threshold amount for purposes of eating, or touches it, one becomes impure, and that amount is an olive's bulk.  And according to the plain sense, one who eats [this amount] becomes impure even if he did not touch it with his hands, as it is written (Lev. 22:8), "He shall not eat anything that died or was torn by beasts, thereby becoming impure."

Chapter 12



Verse 1



Verse 2

A WOMAN WHEN SHE [TAZRIA].  When she becomes pregnant, whether with a male or a female.   If she bears a boy, the rule with respect to him is this, and if she bears a girl, the rule with respect to her is that. It makes a general statement and afterward provides details.
SEVEN DAYS.  Even if there is no blood.
KIY'MEI NIDAT D'VOTAH.  Like the days of separation for her illness, which is set out below.  By seeing impure blood, by seeing blood of {birth}....
NIDAH.  An expression of wandering [nidud] and distancing from her husband.
D'VOTAH.  An expression of sickness, as in "my heart is sick" (Jer. 8:18).

Verse 3



Verse 4

IN THE BLOOD OF PURITY. Which is not menstrual blood.  The straightforward meaning is according to the one who says (Nid. 35b), "There are two sources [of vaginal blood flow]" -- the one of the 33 days is a pure source.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

SHE SHALL BE PURE.  So as to eat holy foods.  Thus explained the Sages, for one lacking only the bringing of the sacrifice [to become pure] may eat t'rumah as soon as the sun sets [on his last day of impurity], but with holy foods [of a higher level of holiness], one may not eat until after the bringing of the sacrifice

Chapter 13



Verse 1



Verse 2

(1) WHEN A PERSON HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS BODY. For all the sections about plagues on the person, plagues on garments, and plagues on houses, their appearances, the calculations of quarantine periods, white hairs and black and yellow hairs, we have nothing following the straightforward meaning of scripture and nothing from expertise in the natural ways of humans; rather, the midrash of the Sages and their laws and their traditions from the early Sages -- that is the essential truth. 
(2) WHEN A PERSON HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS BODY. Because it says below (v. 29), "when there is a plague on the head or the beard," it was necessary here to say "on the skin of his body." [contrasting with Sifra on this v.]  ...
(3) SWELLING [S'EIT]. An expression of height, because it is not as white as is baheret; rather, baheret is [truly] white, as it is written (Job 37:21), "it is light [baheret] in the sky," and it [baheret] appears deeper, as the light appears deeper than the shade. ...
(4) RASH [SAPAHAT].  Secondary to s'eit, or secondary to baheret.  It is a derivative of s'eit, and there also exists a derivative of baheret.  As it is written (I Sam. 2:36), "Please assign me to one of the priestly duties," an expression of being subsidiary and supplemental; this is how the Sages explained it.

SCALL [NETEK].  Tzara'at in a place with hair is called "netek," because it causes the hair to separate [mit'natek].

Verse 31

THERE IS NO BLACK HAIR IN IT, THE PRIEST SHALL ISOLATE THE PERSON.  For if there were black hair, he would be entirely pure, and no isolation would be necessary, for thus it says below (v.37): "if black hair has grown in it, the scall is healed; he is clean. The priest shall pronounce him clean."

(2) [The verb that is in] THAT IS SCRAPED OFF (v. 41) [and] "the house has been scraped " (v. 43) is among the verbs where the heh is dropped -- hik'tzu is derived from katzah.  But one should say that its meaning is an expression of kitzua, from what is written (v. 43), "after hik'tzot et habayit [the house has been scraped]," it appears that the kitzua [scraping -- v. 41] is called hik'tzot, for the language written above [v. 41] is "the house shall be scraped [yak'tzia]."

OOZING FROM HIS FLESH.  Our Rabbis have explained the appearance of [this] discharge and the appearance of semen.

Verse 3



Verse 4

ON WHICH THE ONE [WITH THE DISCHARGE] LIES.  Even if it [the bedding] is under the stone [and the person lies on the stone], so that he does not touch it [the bedding] at all.  The principle is this:  A man or woman with a discharge, or a niddah, any of them renders impure that which is under him with a severe impurity, such that [that object in turn] renders impure [another] person and a garment, if the objects under the person are designated for sitting, even if he has not touched them at all.

But to me it seems, according to the plain meaning, that, because it says above (v.3), "his member runs with its discharge, or is stopped up so that there is no discharge," that it [the discharge] is congealed and sticks to his flesh.   Thus, it speaks in euphemistic language, "without having rinsed 'his hands' in water."  For if he did not scrub his flesh well, and the opening of the penis that was stopped up, as is explained in Tractate Niddah, even though he immersed, he remains impure because he did not scrub well before the immersion, and anyone who touches him will be impure.  And because it is natural that the discharge emerges from the opening of the penis and needs to be scrubbed, it speaks with the expression of rinsing the hands as an analogy, like what is written about the prostitute (Prov. 30:20), "She eats, wipes her mouth, And says, 'I have done no wrong.'"  And likewise (Jud. 3:24), "He was 'anointing his legs'" because it refers to going outside.  Likewise here, "rinsing the hands" in place of the emergence of discharge from _that_ place.  And also, the expression of "rinsing" shows that is for removing filth of some object from its place.  Likewise (Lev. 6:21), "it shall be scoured and rinsed with water" to remove the fat of the sin offering from the vessel, and likewise (Isa. 28:2), "massive torrential rains," and likewise (Job 14:19), "Torrents wash away earth."  Likewise here, to remove the discharge that is on his flesh.

(1) BE IT THE BEDDING, ETC.  One who lies or sits on her midras [basis], even though he does not directly touch that object, ON TOUCHING IT [indirectly] HE SHALL BE IMPURE UNTIL EVENING.  In other words, even if he [merely] touches her saddle. HE WILL BE IMPURE UNTIL EVENING.   But he will not be able to communicate that impurity to garments, for with regard to the saddle, touching is different from bearing, for bearing the saddle makes the bearer impure so as to make his garments impure, but touching it only makes the individual impure, but not his garments.  
(2) ON WHICH SHE HAS SAT.  The Sages interpreted this as merkav-level impurity.

Verse 24

ANY BEDDING ON WHICH HE LIES SHALL BECOME IMPURE.  To the degree that it can make food and drink impure.  The space below intercourse with a nidda is like the space above a zav.  See chapter 4 of Tractate Niddah.  

Verse 25

NOT AT THE TIME OF HER MENSTRUAL SEPARATION.  After the days of her being niddah have passed.  As is explained in Tractate Niddah, a woman is not considered to be a zavah who would have to bring a sacrifice until after the seven days of being a niddah, unless she sees [that subsequent discharge] three consecutive days during the [next] eleven days, whether at the beginning or at the end of that time.  [If she does,] she must observe seven consecutive clean days, and must then bring the sacrifice on the eighth day.

Verse 2

FOR I APPEAR IN THE CLOUD OVER THE [ARK] COVER.  According to the plain meaning, since I appear all the time in the midst of a pillar of cloud over the cover, as it is written (Exod. 25:22), "I will speak with you from over the cover, from between the two kruvim," and if the priest sees, he will die, it follows that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded that, when he enters on Yom Kippur, he should offer incense inside initially, to darken the interior with a cloud of incense, and afterwards bring the bullock's blood and the goat's blood.

AHARON SHALL BRING FORWARD -- in the courtyard -- HIS BULL AS A SIN OFFERING TO EFFECT ATONEMENT FOR HIMSELF.  He shall immediately make confession over it.

Verse 9



Verse 10

(1) TO SEND IT OFF TO THE WILDERNESS FOR AZAZEL. According to its plain sense, to send it off alive to the mountains in the wilderness, as we find with the birds of [the purification ritual for the] m'tzora (Lev. 14:7): "he shall set the live bird free in the open country," to purify him from his ritual impurity. Likewise here: to purify Israel from their sins, he sets it free toward the wilderness, it being a place of pasture for beasts, as it is written (Exod. 3:1), "he drove the flock into the wilderness," and in the Talmud, "midbariot" [desert animals] and "beitiot" [domestic animals], in Tractate Beitza (40a). 
(2) TO AZ'AZEL.  The lamed is an extra letter, like the lamed in Beit Arbel (Hos. 10:14), which is from the expression of (Deut. 19:11) "va'arev lo" [he lies in wait for him]. Likewise, the mem of reikam [empty] and hinam [free] are extra letters, to embellish a word for the action, like the mem of shiga'on [craziness], itzavon [sadness], and isaron [tenth]. [And below (v.22), it calls the place where the goat is released a land of] g'zeirah, an arid land where there are no crops, which is cut off and separated from all good things.

Verse 16

(1) DO NOT GO ABOUT TALEBEARING [JPS: Do not deal basely].  One who goes around in the towns goes telling defamation from this person to that one.  The Targum is "Lo teichul kurtzin" -- do not broadcast gossip.  Likewise in Daniel (3:8), "they slandered the Jews."  [V'achalu is] "they brodcast."  Similarly (II Sam. 22:14), "thundered from heavens," translated [Targum Yonatan] as "achlei min shamaya," an expression of causing the voice to be heard.  
(2) DO NOT STAND IDLY BY THE BLOOD OF OUR FELLOW.  Do not stand across from it; rather, it is permissible to save him at the cost of the life of the pursuer.

Verse 17



Verse 18

(1) DO NOT TAKE VENGEANCE.  Repaying evil for evil.  
(2) AND DO NOT BEAR A GRUDGE.  Even internally; rather, waive your rights.  
(3) LOVE YOUR FELLOW AS YOURSELF.  He is "your fellow" if he is good, but not if he is bad, as is is written (Prov. 8:13), "To fear Adonai is to hate evil."

Verse 19



Verse 20

(1) DESIGNATED.  Given over and exclusive to a Hebrew servant.  "If his master gave him a wife" (Ex. 21:14).  Similarly (Jud. 5:18), "a people that mocked at death" -- they were dedicated.  And likewise in the Targum. 
 
(3) THERE SHALL BE AN INQUIRY [JPS: INDEMNITY]. As in (Lev. 13:36), "the priest need not look for [yellow hair]."  Dunash [ibn Labrat] and Menahem [ben Seruk] interpreted it this way.  The court shall investigate; if she was not released, they shall not sentence him to death as in [a case of actual] adultery.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

REGARD ... AS FORBIDDEN [VA'ARALTEM].  An expression of being closed, stopped up, distanced.  "Their ears are blocked" (Jer. 6:10), "uncircumcised in spirit" (Ezek. 44:9),  "drink in your turn and stagger" (Hab. 2:16).

Verse 24

SET ASIDE [KODESH] FOR JUBILATION.  "Kodesh" like ma'aser sheni [the second tithe], to be eaten in Jerusalem and to praise the Creator, for we find with respect to ma'aser sheni that they should eat it "in the place that He shall choose ... so that you may learn to revere the LORD your God forever"  (Deut. 14:23).

Verse 25



Verse 26

DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ON ITS BLOOD.  According to its plain sense, this must be understood based on its context:  
DO NOT PRACTICE DIVINATION OR SOOTHSAYING.  This also they would do according to the practices of the non-Jews, who would eat over the grave of a slain person for sorcery purposes, so that he would not take vengeance, or for other sorcery purposes, as we say with a nail from a crucifixion.  And our Sages explained it in various ways in Tractate Sanhedrin.

FOR A PERSON HE SHALL NOT LET HIMSELF BECOME IMPURE B'AMAV.  A man among the "people" [b'am] of priests shall not let himself become impure for a person.  As in (21:14), "a virgin of his own kin [me'amav] may he take to wife."  But if it had written l'amav, the meaning would be "he shall not let himself become impure for his kin," as it is written, "for a person [l'nefesh] he shall not let himself become impure" (21;1), "for his brother or his sister [l'ahiv ul'ahoto] he shall not let himself become impure for them [lahem]" (Num. 6:7), and it does not say "bahem."  It is also possible to explain it "for a soul [b'nefesh] that happens to be among his people [b'amav] he shall not let himself become impure."

Likewise "vayamawt" and "vayanaws" (Gen. 11:28, Gen. 39:12), on an etnahta they are all [vocalized with] m'lapom, "vayamot" (Gen. 5:5) and (Ps. 114:3), "hayam ra'ah vayanos."

And also at the end -- these Rebukes are on account of the Sh'mita, as it is written (Lev. 26:35), "Throughout the time that it is desolate, it shall observe the rest."  For all of the mitzvot of Parashat B'har Sinai speak about Sh'mitot and Yov'lot, and freeing slaves and returning property.  Thus it says here the Rebukes for the sins of Sh'mitot were "on Mt.Sinai" -- all [mitzvot and Rebukes] at once.
