HAPID'YOM (THE REDEMPTION).  The mem is superfluous, like the mem in reikam, hakinam, and shilshom.  The 300 Levites in excess over the 22,000 [compare vv. 22, 28, and 34 with v.39] were themselves firstborns, and a firstborn cannot annul the status of another firstborn; so explained our Sages.

Verse 10

THE PLACED IT ON A POLE [MOT].  Rabbi Yosef Kara erred in explaining this [on the basis] that it is not written here, as it is written elsewhere (Num. 13:23) "on a pole carried by two," and he sought to say that the entire pole was under the utensils, since it is written "al" [on].  And I replied that the poles were on the side of the utensils, as with every portage, where they would place the poles in the rings that were on the sides of the utensils, as is written in the section about the Tabernacle.  However, in connection with the expression "v'nat'nu" [they placed], it is appropriate to say "on ["al"] the pole," while in connection with the expression "masa" [carrying], it says "with/on ["ba-"] the pole," as it is written (Num. 13:23), "they carried it with a pole," or (Exod. 25:28), "by these the table shall be carried."  As it is written, "on the shoulder [bakatef] they will carry it" [see Isa. 46:7:  "On their shoulders [al katef] they will bear it."]; (II Chron. 35:3), "you no longer carry it (except) on your shoulders [bakatef]."  In other words, "with this thing [bazeh] they carry that thing."

SINS [AGAINST] PERSONS. Which are recorded in the secton on the asham offered in connection with theft, at the end of Parashat VaYikra: "Dealing etc. deceitfully with his fellow in the matter of a pledge ...," and it is repeated here for the sake of the convert without a redeeming kinsman.

Verse 7

HE SHALL RESTORE THE /ASHAM/. I.e., the principal.

Verse 8

(1) BESIDES THE RAM. The /asham/ discussed in VaYikra.  
(2) THE /ASHAM/ THAT IS REPAID.  The principal returns to the priests.

Verse 9

EVERY /T'RUMAH/.  The /t'rumah/ of the first, which Israel separates, and the /t'rumah/ of the tithe, which the Levites separate, [both of] which are elaborated in Parashat Sh'lah L'cha.

Verse 10


(2) IT SHALL BE HIS.  In other words, the person must give it to a kohen.
(3) And a midrash: AND IF A PERSON GIVES TO A KOHEN what he is required to give him, THERE SHALL BE TO HIM much wealth.  Because it is superfluous, they expounded on it.

Verse 3

ANYTHING IN WHICH GRAPES HAVE BEEN STEEPED [MISHRAT ANAVIM].  Menahem [ben Seruk] explains this [as related to] (Num. 8:26), "He will serve [sheiret] with his brothers."  So the mem [in mishrat] is like the mem of "mirmas" ("a thing trampled" Isa. 10:6) and of "mishmar" ("custody" Gen. 40:3), and of (Isa. 17:4) "the fatness [mishman] of his body become lean."  But there cannot be language of "sherut" except in connection with work of people for their masters.  So I say that "mishrat" is among the words where the third letter of the root is removed, and is from the root shin-reish-heh, as "miknat kesef" (Ex. 12:44 "monetary purchase") is from the root kof-nun-heh, and its meaning, even though it [the root] does not appear in Scripture, it does appear in the Talmud, "the Nazir who soaks [shesheirah] his bread in wine."  And as for the language of Scripture, we find in Jeremiah (15:11), "I will spare [sheiriticha] for a better fate."  And its meaning is like "m'sharei kitrin" ("solve problems," "untie knots") in Daniel (5:12) -- in other words, "I have opened your chains."   And it says [the vocalization is] "sheiriticha," like (Ma. 2:3) "I will strew [v'zeiriti] dung on your faces" from the root (Num. 17:2) "cast" [z'reh].  Likewise here, "mishrat" of grapes means anything that separates from and falls from the grapes, like a person who is separated from and freed from the bonds and chains in which he is bound.

THUS SHALL YOU BLESS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL.  In other words, do not bless them with a blessing of your own mouth [your own creation], like a person who says, "may there befall so-and-so such-and-such."  Rather, you should pray to Me that I bless them, as it says, "May Adonai bless you," and I will hear your voice, as you say it.  AND I WILL BLESS THEM.  Israel, as it says, "THEY SHALL PLACE MY NAME ON THE ISRAELITES," when the kohanim bless Israel in My name and not in their own.  I WILL BLESS THEM -- Israel, as the kohanim prayed, and said, "May Adonai bless you."

Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

MAY ADONAI LIFT UP HIS FACE TOWARD YOU.  As it is written (Lev. 26:9), "I will look with favor on you [lit.:  will face you]."  That He should not hide His face from you.  And that which is written (Deut. 10:17 -- misquoting), "Who will not lift up the face of any person" [means] the Holy One, blessed be He, will not "lift up" the face of any person so as to clear him of all his sins, but rather He will lift up His own face towards His loved one; He will face him to be gracious to him, as it is written (Lev. 26:9), "I will look with favor upon you, ... and multiply you."

Verse 2

IN CHARGE OF THE ENROLLMENT. These are the ones mentioned by name in Parashat B'midbar.

Verse 3

(1) DRAFT CARTS.  Since this noun is in the construct state: wagons [agalot] of litters.  As from "asarah" [ten] one says [in the construct state] "esrot" [tens of], so one says from a cart [agalah] of two chieftains "eglot" [carts of (litters).]  And from "anavah" [humility] [the construct case is] "anvei eretz" [the lowly of the earth] (Ps. 76:10), and from "aravah" [willow] "arvei nahal" [willows of the brook] (Lev. 23:40).  
(2) LITTER [TZAV].  Like (Isa. 66:20) "on drays [tzavim] and mules"; its meaning depends on the context.  {It seems to me [that it means] carts made for travel with the army and on distant roads.}

THIS IS THE RULE FOR THE LEVITES.  This is a new commandment, which has not been mentioned, for in Parashat B'midbar Sinai, and in Parashat Naso, the Holy One blessed be He commanded to count those between ages 30 and 50, for "service and carrying," "to carry the Mishkan."  Now in this parasha, it comes to explain the mitzvot of the service of guarding the Mishkan, that five years before the 30th year, when he is not fit for carrying, he is fit for, and commanded regarding, the guarding of the Mishkan and its appurtenances.  And from 50 years on, when he is not fit for carrying, he is fit for, and commanded regarding, the guarding of the Mishkan and its appurtenances, as it continues to explain:  
FROM TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE UP THEY SHALL PARTICIPATE IN THE WORK FORCE IN THE SERVICE OF THE TENT OF MEETING -- the work of guarding, as it explains immediately below (v.26):  "They may assist their brother Levites ... by standing guard."

Verse 25



Verse 26

(1) THEY MAY ASSIST/SERVE -- both groups -- THEIR BROTHER LEVITES ... BY STANDING GUARD, BUT THEY SHALL PERFORM NO LABOR.
(2) THUS YOU SHALL DEAL WITH THE LEVITES IN REGARD TO THEIR DUTIES.  Five years before the 30th year and from age 50 on they shall be commanded regarding the guarding of the Mishkan.

Verse 32



Verse 33

(1) FROM THE MOUNTAIN OF ADONAI.  For they still had not moved from facing Mt. Horev, which is in the Wilderness of Sinai.  And this was after the Mishkan had been erected, as I explained above, but nevertheless, they were beside Mt. Sinai until now.  
(2) THREE DAYS' DISTANCE. They traveled for three days, and did not camp until the end of the third day.  And because of the arduousness of the traveling, "the people took to complaining" (11:1), as we find in Parashat Parah [i.e., Hukkat] (Num. 21:4-5):  "But the people grew restive on the journey, And the people spoke against God and against Moshe."  
(3) THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF ADONAI TRAVELED IN FRONT OF THEM those three days TO SEEK OUT A RESTING PLACE FOR THEM, for the cloud traveled over the Ark.  

Verse 34



Verse 35

ARISE, ADONAI.  For it was then that the Sh'chinah would leave [its usual place] over the Ark cover.

Verse 7

NOW THE MANNA WAS LIKE CORIANDER SEED, and its appearance was like the appearance of BDELLIUM. In other words, it appeared to be tough and dry, and that is why they said (v.6), "Now our spirits are parched [JPS: our gullets are shriveled]" -- like a person who eats dry wheat. If so, why did the Holy One, blessed be He, get angry, as it says below (v.10)? So now it explains the reason for the anger, for when they would (v.8) "grind it between millstones or pound it in a mortar," _then_ "it tasted like rich cream"; i.e., then its taste would change. For initially it was sweet, "like wafers in honey" (Exod. 16:31), like olives and walnuts before being ground, but after grinding, or being crushed in a mortar, then its taste becomes like the moistness of oil or fatty meat, like the taste of olives or walnuts after grinding, when their taste changes. Therefore [misquoting v.10], "Adonai heard [in verse, "Moses heard"] ... and He was angry," for whenever they wanted, they would grind it, and it would become like oil, and their food would not be dry. Here it is written (v.8), "Its taste was," for its initial taste changed. But in Parashat B'shalah, it is written (Exod. 16:31), "Its taste was like wafers in honey," for that was its taste before it had the taste of oil.


Verse 8

(1) L'SHAD.  All of it [all of the letters] are the root.  As in (Ps. 32:4), "my vigor waned as in the summer drought" -- my moistness has changed into the dryness of figs that have dried.  
(2) WOULD GO ABOUT.  As in (Job 1:7) "roaming the earth," (Jer. 5:1) "Roam the streets of Jerusalem."

Verse 20

(1) UNTIL IT COMES OUT OF YOUR NOSTRILS.  As in the Targum [Onkelos -- until you get sick of it].  
(2) WHY DID WE EVER LEAVE EGYPT.  For you said (v.5), "We remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt," and because you should be grateful, you will be punished.   But if you had [merely] had a yen for meat but had not complained about leaving Egypt, you would not be punished so much, as with other complaints, for there are some for which they were not punished.

Verse 21

MOSHE SAID SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ETC.  One must explain this in the way I explained (Exod. 19:23), "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai."  Here also, Moshe was afraid because the Holy One, blessed be He, had said (v.20) that they would eat [meat] "for a month," and He also said (ibid.) "it will become loathsome to you."  So he asked the Holy One, blessed be He, "You said that they would eat for a month, but aren't there are 600,000 men, aside from women and children, and isn't it the case that all of their flocks and herds will not suffice for a month, and how will You fulfill this matter?  Either you will wipe them out and the few who remain will get by for a month, for You said "it will become loathsome to you," or You will perform miracles to bring them meat from elsewhere.

Verse 26

AMONG THOSE RECORDED.  Who were on the list to go to the Tent, but they did not go, out of modesty, as is explained in Sanhedrin.

Verse 27



Verse 28


(2) RESTRAIN THEM.  As in (Gen. 8:2), "the rain was held back."  Contain them, prevent them from [going to] the marketplace, and put them in jail [beit hakelei].  Alef, het, heh, and ayin cause the form to be "kla'eim" [rather than "kal'eim"], as with (Gen. 23:6) "Hear us [sh'ma'einu] my lord," and (Deut. 32:10), "He found him [yim'tza'eihu] in a desert region."

Chapter 12



Verse 1

(1) CUSHIT.  From the family of Ham.  
(2) HE TOOK A CUSHITE WOMAN.  As it is said in the Chronicle of Moshe Rabbeinu, he was a king in the land of Cush for 40 years, and he took a queen, but did not sleep with her, as it is said there.  But they [Aharon and Miriam] did not know, when they spoke against him, that he was not intimate with her.  This is the plain sense of this, for if it was regarding Tziporah that they spoke, what need would there be to specify that he took a Cushite woman?  And until this point, aren't we aware that Tziporah was a Midianite?  And another response that she was not Cushite is that Cush was a child of Ham, while Midian was a child of Keturah, whom she bore to Avraham.

Verse 2

(1) THEY SAID, "IS IT ONLY THROUGH MOSHEH"  In other words, they also said this against Mosheh:  How can he exalt himself over us -- He also spoke through us to Israel.  
(2) THROUGH US [BANU].  By means of us.

Verse 3



Verse 4

SUDDENLY/IMMEDIATELY [PIT'OM].  At the very time when they were speaking against Mosheh, and it was not a regular time for speaking with them.  But it was rather to rebuke them and to accord respect to Mosheh.

Verse 12

(1) DO NOT BE [AL NA T'HI] LIKE A DEAD PERSON.  In other words, for the sake of your honor, and for your own sake, do not -- you yourself -- be like a dead person.  How?  WHO -- the one who is born -- IN HIS LEAVING -- the one who is born from its belly -- THE WOMB OF HIS MOTHER -- [the mother] of his brother, the one who is alive, and here there has been consumed HALF HIS FLESH of the living one.  In other words, since Miriam was born from the womb of Moshe's mother,--
(2) DO NOT BE.  Do not you be like a dead person.   As with (Prov. 22:26), "Do not be one of those who give their hand;" (24:28) "Do not be a witness without good cause;" (23:20) "Do not be of those who guzzle wine."

Chapter 13



Verse 1



Verse 2

(1) KOL NASI BAHEM. The essence of the straightforward meaning is as follows: Take these 12 men from among those of Israel whose mind impels them to go. You shall (set out the people) [proclaim to the people:] Who is the one who wants to go spy out the land? And from those who propose to go, take and choolse 12 from them. And because the men would be strong, that they would not be afraid or weak of spirit, they are fit to go into a strange land and also to fortify themselves and to take from the fruit of the land, therefore it was necessary to make this announcement, and the Holy One, blessed be He, did not specify them by name as He did with the N'si'im who counted Israel [Num. 1:3 ff.], and with the N'si'im who apportioned the land among Israel in [Parashat] Mas'ei [Num. 34:16 ff.], for those were specified by name. 
(2) KOL NASI VAHEM. The trop mark under "kol" shows the meaning: Each of these 12 would be "nasi" among those who volunteered to go. As in (Ps. 8;7): "laying the world at his feet."

MOSHE CALLED HOSHEA BIN NUN YEHOSHUA. It was not now that he called him such, for already before this he had been called Yehoshua; rather this is the meaning: Hoshea bin Nun whom we have mentioned above, who was called such in his father's home, is the same one whom Moshe called [Yehoshua] when he became his servant and he set him over his household. For such was their practice, as in: "Pharaoh then gave Joseph the name Tsafenat-paneah" (Gen. 41:45), and he called Daniel "Belteshazzar after the name of my god" (Dan. 4:5).

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

WHAT IS THE COUNTRY LIKE IN WHICH THEY DWELL.  And the "What is the land" that we have mentioned above speaks about the land that is at the beginning of the kingdom, where there is no settlement, and now it speaks about the land in which they dwell.  

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

(1) HE CAME TO HEVRON. The aggada seems to be the plain sense -- that Scripture is referring to Kalev, as it says (Deut. 1:36), "to him ... will I give the land on which he set foot," and (14:24), "him will I bring into the land that he entered, and his offspring shall hold it as a possession." Therefore, "he came to Hevron" refers to Kalev, and he prostrated himself on the graves of his ancestors and prayed to be saved from the counsel of the [other] spies. And we find in Joshua that he gave Hevron to Kalev, as it is written (Josh. 21:12), "They gave the fields and the villages of the town to Kalev son of Yefunneh as his holding." Nevertheless, the real plain sense, it is "each of them came to Hevron, since they said (see v.28), "we also saw the Anakites there" -- in Hevron (v.22); it is also written (v.33), "and there we saw the N'filim, the Anakites." 
(2) BEFORE TZO'AN OF EGYPT. According to the plain sense, it was built before Tzo'an, and also, the older city is more important than the new city. For Israel were familiar with the importance of Tzo'an; it was necessary to say that the cities of Israel were more important. And also, because of its age, there giants there who were from the early generations.

Verse 15



Verse 16

But now it explains why in the first place why the Egyptians would say this.  For they heard that You had brought them [the Israelites] out with great strength, with a pillar of fire, and with a pillar of cloud, all from surpassing love and care, but that in the end You would kill them all as one?  And the Egyptians would say, "It wasn't from hate that He treated them this way, but rather it was because of His inability to wage war against 31 kings.  And now (Exod. 32:12), "Turn from Your blazing anger," for the sake of Your name, that it not be desecrated.

(2) DIBAH [CALUMNIES].  From (Song 7:10) "Moving gently [dovev] the lips of sleepers" [Old JPS; New JPS:  "Gliding over the lips of sleepers"; others:  "causing to speak"].  [Other examples of nouns of the form XiYah from roots of the form XYY:]  As with (Prov. 11:10), "When the wicked perish there are shouts of joy [rinah]" [is from] (Job 20:5) "The joy [rin'nat] of the wicked has been brief."  And (I Kings 12:15) "the LORD had brought it about" [lit., the cause [sibah] was from Adonai].  From "sovev" [to cause], [we derive] "sibah."

TZITZIT (TASSELS; JPS: FRINGES).  As in (Ezek. 8:3), "by the hair of [b'tzitzit] my head," threads hanging like the hair of the head.

Verse 39

(1) IT SHALL BE A TASSEL (TZITZIT, JPS: FRINGE) FOR YOU.  This tzitzit shall be for you for seeing, so that you shall see it/Him, as in (Song 2:9) "peering [meitzitz] through the lattice," and I found it so in the Sifrei.  
(2) A CORD OF BLUE (v.38).  Our Sages expounded, "Since the blue resembles the sea, and the sea resembles the sky, and the sky the Throne of Glory."

Verse 1

(1) KORAH TOOK.  As in (Gen. 12:5), "Abram took his wife Sarai and Lot."  So here, "Korah took."

Verse 11

TRULY YOU AND ALL OF YOUR COMPANY are the ones WHO HAVE BANDED TOGETHER AGAINST ADONAI.

Verse 12

THEY SAID, "WE WILL NOT COME UP" to you for judgment.  An expression of "going up" is normal to use in connection with going to the judges:  "his brother's widow shall go up to the gate" (Deut. 25:7); "the Israelites would go up to her for decisions" (Jud. 4:5); "Boaz had gone up to the gate" (Ruth 4:1).

Verse 13

[YOU WOULD LORD IT OVER US] ALSO LORD IT OVER US.  "Gam"s in the Torah are [often] reversed [i.e., out of order]: "you would also lord it over us [also] lord it over us."  Likewise (Ex. 12:32), "And bless me also" -- And also bless me.  Likewise (Gen. 29:30), "he loved Rahel also" -- he also loved Rahel.  "You also I would have killed" (Num. 22:33) -- I would also have killed you.

Verse 14


WE WILL NOT GO UP.  Therefore, we will not come up to you.  This is a "general followed by a specific followed by a general."  "We will not go up" it said initially, and afterwrds, it explained why, and then it went back to the general; therefore, "we will not go up."

Verse 15

(1) PAY NO REGARD.  From p-n-h, as (Gen. 43:14) "Binyamin's gift was bigger" ["vateireiv"] is from r-b-h.  "Al teifen" [with a tzeirei under the first letter] is "al tifneh" [binyan kal - do not turn]; "al tefen" [with a segol under the first letter] is "al tafneh" [binyan hif'il - do not cause another to turn].  
(2) I HAVE NOT TAKEN A SINGLE ASS OF THEIRS.  Not even one ass have I taken from them [as do] others who lord it over people.  And so why do they accuse me of lording it over them?  And if it were vocalized "lo hamor ahad mehem" (with a patah), its meaning would be "the ass of one of them," as in (Gen. 26:10) "one of the people" [ahad ha'am].

(1) AS THE LORD HAD ORDERED HIM THROUGH MOSES.  This refers back to (v.4) "Eleazar the priest took the fire pans" (v.1) "from among the charred remains" AS THE LORD HAD ORDERED THROUGH MOSES 
(2) TO HIM.  Elazar.   For this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moshe (v.1):  "Order Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the fire pans."

Verse 6

YOU HAVE BROUGHT DEATH UPON THE LORD’S PEOPLE.  Regarding Datan and Aviram who were swallowed up, we acknowledge that they sinned.  But the 250 who died like the death of Nadav and Avihu, you killed them by ordering them to offer the incense.

Verse 7

Verse 10

LIFT YOURSELVES OUT ("HEIROMU"; JPS:  "REMOVE YOURSELVES").  Like (Jer. 4:4) "Himolu" ("Be circumcised to Adonai" [JPS:  "Open your hearts to the LORD"]), but because of the reish, the hirik is changed to [a tzeirei] as with "beireich" [instead of] "bireich" in the emphatic [pi'el] conjugation.  Above it says (Num. 16:21), "Separate yourselves ("hibadlu"; JPS: "Stand back"), and here it says "Lift yourselves out" ("heiromu"), which implies a greater separation, because the wrath has already emerged.

I WILL RID MYSELF ("VAHASIKOTI").  From [the same root as] (Esth. 7:10) "the king's wrath abated" ("shachacha").  "Hasibota" ("You have turned"; I Kings 18:37) from "sovev" (to turn).

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

(1) IT BROUGHT FORTH SPROUTS, PRODUCED BLOSSOMS, AND BORE ALMONDS.  According to the plain sense, it seems that, when Moshe brought it out, he found that it had sprouted, but no more than that, as it is written, "here, Aharon's staff had sprouted."  But after that-- 
(2) IT PRODUCED BLOSSOMS, in sight of everyone.  And after that, IT BORE ALMONDS.  For if the matter had been so from the beginning, neither the sprouting nor the blossoming would have been seen, and it should not have written, "here, it had sprouted," but rather, "here, the staff of Aharon of the House of Levi had borne almonds."

Verse 24

Verse 26



Verse 27

(1) WE ARE LOST [AVADNU].  [This is a reference to Num. 16:33:] "they vanished from the midst of the congregation."  [In other words,] "If so, all of us are being lost, day by day."  How so?  
(2) EVERYONE WHO SO MUCH AS VENTURES NEAR.  Any person who comes near the Mishkan to protect it, or near the vessels of the Mishkan with the Levites, will die.  For the Holy One, blessed be He, has not yet issued a warning against them, for nothing had yet been written [except] (e.g., Num. 1:51), "the outsider who approaches shall be put to death."  Therefore, He prohibits in this parasha (Num. 18:4, 7), "no outsider shall intrude upon you" and "any outsider who encroaches shall be put to death," for from here on, they will not approach at all and will not die.  For even in Parashat Emor, where it is written (Lev. 21:17), "Speak to Aaron and say: No man of your offspring throughout the ages who has a defect shall be qualified to offer the food of his God," there it invalidated only those with physical blemishes, but it did not invalidate outsiders, and what was invalidated there in the [next] section, "Say to them: ... if any man among partakes etc."  What it is speaking about is one who dies because of bodily impurity, but regarding service by outsiders in the Mishkan or with its vessels, we have not yet seen any liability for death.

Chapter 18



Verse 1

THE LORD SAID TO AARON: YOU AND YOUR SONS ETC.  and (v.4) NO OUTSIDER SHALL INTRUDE, and (v.7) ANY OUTSIDER WHO ENCROACHES SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH.  Thus, I have prohibited them with a death penalty, so there is reason to be concerned that (Num. 7:28) "everyone who so much as ventures near [must die]," for I have prohibited them with "do not approach" and have made them liable for capital punishment [if they do].

Verse 2

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

A SERVICE OF DEDICATION.  The result is that the Israelites [as opposed to the priests and levites] are exempt from the sacrificial service, and since they are not commanded, they will no longer approach, since (Num. 7:28) "everyone who so much as ventures near [must die]." 

Verse 8

I GRANT THEM TO YOU AND TO YOUR SONS AS A PERQUISITE [LIT.: AN ANOINTMENT].  For they are to you like a sign of rulers, who are anointed in order to reign.

Verse 9

(1) FROM THE FIRE.  What was left over from the fire after the turning into smoke of the portions to be burned.  
(2) THAT THEY RENDER TO ME.  The asham, "which is repaid to Adonai for the priest" (Num. 5:8).  This refers to theft from a convert who has no heirs.

COVENANT OF SALT.  It seems to me that this is an expression of permanence, and it is such with regard to David (II Chron. 13:5), "[forever] to him and his sons as a covenant of salt," for the meaning depends on the context.  However, "you shall not omit from your meal offering the salt of your covenant with God [melah brit Eloheicha]" (Lev. 2:13) refers to actual salt.  "A covenant of salt" is a covenant of permanance, which remains through the generations.

(1) THIS IS THE LAW OF THE TORAH.  Below it will explain to which "Torah" it refers:  "This is the Torah when a person dies in a tent" (v.14).  In other words, "the law of the Torah" when He said to Moshe, "This is the Torah ..."  
(2) RED COW.  He commanded to take [the cow] and perform the Torah [instruction] of purification of "When a person dies in a tent" -- to become purified through it [one who] touches, carryies, or covers with a tent.

(1) TAKE THE STAFF.  From before the Testimony.  
(2) SPEAK TO THE ROCK. The Holy One, blessed be He, did not command to take the staff in order to strike the rock with it, as he did at R'fidim, as it is written there (Exod. 17:6), "Strike the rock and water will come out of it."  Rather, he commanded taking the staff in order to demonstrate with it their stubborn rebelliousness, as it is written (Num. 17:25), "for safekeeping, as a sign to rebels."  But it would be through speaking to the rock that it would yield its water.  
(3) YOU SHALL PRODUCE WATER FOR THEM.  Through your speaking to the rock.

Verse 9



Verse 10

(1) HE SAID TO THEM, LISTEN, YOU REBELS.  As this staff, which has almonds, shows that it is "for safekeeping as a sign to rebels."  
(2) WILL WE PRODUCE WATER FOR YOU FROM THIS ROCK?  At the moment of lifting up his hand with the staff [see v. 11], "he hit the rock" with it "twice."  Then he said to them, in anger and rage, "do you think that, from this rock, we can produce water for you?"  It was out of doubt that Moshe said this, for he erred with respect to what the Holy One, blessed be He, had said to him, "take your staff," for he did not believe that by talking to the rock, he could produce water, but rather by striking [with] the staff, as he had done at R'fidim.  And the Holy One's, blessed be He, statement to him (v.8), "speak to the rock," he thought that this "speaking" to the rock that was mentioned was with the staff, and so he hit the rock twice, as with anger and rage, and out of doubt:  if it produces water, good, and if not, I will speak to the rock afterwards.  And the Holy One, blessed be He, ratified [what] Moshe [said, for the water] to go out through his striking, and even so, he was punished, because the Holy One, blessed be He, is exacting with the righteous ones, and this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said (v.12): "because you did not trust Me enough to sanctify Me" -- through their speaking to the rock.  For He is exacting with the righteous ones, even by as much as a hair's breadth.  And because I know, I the commentator, that our Master Moshe transgressed the words of the Holy One, blessed be He, only unintentionally, therefore I am constrained to explain that our Master Moshe erred, as I have explained. 

Chapter 21



Verse 1

(1) DWELLING IN THE NEGEV ... BY WAY OF THE ATARIM.  The tarim [scouts] -- the spies.  As it is written there (Num. 13:7), "Go up there into the Negev"; (Num. 13:29), "Amalek dwells in [the land of] the Negev"; and the Canaanites are nearby (Num. 14:43), "For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there to face you."  
(2) HA'ATARIM.  Like efroah (see Deut. 22:6), etmol (see Ps. 90:4), ezroa (see Jer. 32:21).  There are many alefs that are auxiliary letters at the beginning of the word.

(1) ULAI SHE HAD STRAYED BEFORE ME. Every "ulai" in Scripture has a meaning like "im" and like "ilu." And those who explain this "im" as like "lulei hitmah'mahnu" (If we had not delayed - Gen. 43:10) and like "lulei Adonai" (If not for the God of my father - Gen. 31:42; better, e.g.: Ps. 94:17 - Were not Adonai my help) are mistaken. Rather, its meaning is as in "ulai yesh tikva" (Maybe there is hope - Lam. 3:29) or "Maybe Adonai of hosts will be gracious" (Amos 5:15) or "Maybe it was a mistake" (Gen. 43:12). Likewise, the angel asks, "Why did you hit your ass three times? You acted improperly for "it shied away (vatet lifanai) three times" -- all of her shyings were lifanai (in front of me) and not mipanai (from in front of me) since she did not pass me by. 
(2) ULAI NAT'TAH MIPANAI. In other words, if (ulai) she had passed from before me (mipanai) rather than before me (lifanai), in other words, if she had passed me on the way, until she was behind me, I would also have killed you (gam haragti ot'cha), in other words, you would not have gotten away with a minor injury of pressing your leg, but rather I would even have killed you (af ot'cha haragti) and she would not have lost anything, because I would have kept her alive as she is even now, for it was not she who sinned but you, for you sinned against Me, in that you struck your ass. 
(3) GAM OT'CHA (you also). I would also (even) have killed you, as in (Exod. 12:32) "uveirachtem gam oti" (me also may you bless) -- may you even bless me.

(1) YAN'HEINI (lit. "he will bring me").  He has brought me (hin'hani).  
(2) FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF THE EAST.  This is repetition, for it is written (Isa. 9:11) "Aram from the east."  In other words, a big burden, and from a distant land, and for nought, since it won't be effective.  
(3) ZA'AMAH.  It seems to me that the zayin is with a patah ("ah"), which is an imperative ("Curse!"), but zo'amah with a m'lapom ("oh") would imply feminine zo'emet (i.e., present tense indicative mood), as in "esh ochlah" (Deut. 4:24 - a fire that burns), and "hi shoftah et yisrael" (Jud. 4:4 - she judging).

Verse 8

THE LORD HAS NOT DOOMED them; He did not anger them.  As it is written (Mal. 1:4), "the people damned ... of the Lord" (JPS), that the Holy One blessed be He angered them.  It is an expression of causing other persons to be angry.

(3) TO CHANGE HIS MIND.  A rhetorical question -- how could He change His mind?  
(4) AND NOT CARRY IT OUT. A rhetorical question.

Verse 1

TOWARDS CHARMS.  To try various places [in hopes that] he would be able to curse them, but henceforth, he intended to bless them wholeheartedly, and for that reason, it is written here, "THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAME UPON HIM" -- The spirit of the Sh'chinah settled on him out of love, with affection.

And this is the counsel (Num. 31:16 ff.):  "Yet they [the women] are the very ones who, at the bidding of Bil'am, etc."  But here, Moshe conceals the counsel, because Bil'am said it to Balak in a whisper, and the counsel did not become known until Moshe expressed it at a time when that was needed.

Verse 1



Verse 2

MOSHE SPOKE TO THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES.  I was asked in Anjou, in the city Loudun, according to the simple sense of the text, where do we find any other section that begins this way?  For it does not say above, "The LORD spoke to Moshe saying, 'If a man make a vow etc.'"  How can the section begin with Moshe's speech which is not explicitly from the mouth of the Almighty?  And this was my answer:  Above, it is written (Num. 29:39), "All these you shall offer to the LORD at the stated times, in addition to your votive and freewill offerings," that if you must bring on one of the three festivals, on account of "Do not be tardy," as is set out in Tractate Rosh Hashana, Moshe went and spoke to the heads of the tribes, who were the judges, for them to instruct Israel in the laws of vows, and he told them, "The Holy One blessed be He commanded me that they should bring their votive and freewill offerings on the festival lest they be tardy in their vows."  Therefore -- 
IF A MAN MAKES A VOW TO THE LORD -- a sacrifice -- OR TAKES AN OATH -- of self-denial (see v. 14).

Verse 3

(1) IMPOSING AN OBLIGATION ON HIMSELF ... HE SHALL NOT BREAK HIS PLEDGE. This refers to the votive offering. In other words, he must not delay his votive offering until after the festivals, as the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded. For this is the explanation of "he shall not break [lo yahel]," as in (Jud. 3:25) "He waited [actually, "They waited"] a long time"; (Gen. 8:10) "He waited another seven days"; (Ps. 130:7) "O Israel, wait for the LORD" -- wait and anticipate Him. And one who explains [this] as an expression of desecration [hilul] according to the straightforward sense is in error.
(2) HE MUST CARRY OUT ALL THAT HAS CROSSED HIS LIPS. This refers back to "taking an oath" (hishava sh'vu'ah) [i.e., not to "makes a vow" (yidor neder)] -- he must do according to what he specified in taking an oath, according to the time he specified, whether short or long. And a proof of the matter,of what these two things mean, is what Moshe said in Deuteronomy (23:22), "When you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not put off fulfilling it, ... You must fulfill what has crossed your lips and perform ...." Takes an oath, etc.

IF, WHILE IN HER HUSBAND’S HOUSEHOLD, SHE MAKES A VOW.  But above (v.7), it is written, "[If she should marry] while her vow ... is still in force."  That verse deals with prior vows, before she married, and the implication, according to the plain sense, is that the husband can nullify prior vows.

Verse 55

(1) STINGS IN YOUR EYES.  An expression of thorns and thistles that pierce the eyes, as in (Hos. 2:8), "I will hedge up her roads with thorns."  And the Book of Joshua proves this (23:13):  "They shall become a snare and a trap for you, a scourge [shotet] to your sides [and thorns in your eyes]" -- an expression of (I Kings 12:11), "my father flogged you with whips [shotim]," [and] (Prov. 26:3), "a whip [shot] for a horse."  
(2) THORNS [TZININIM].  This also is among the kinds of thorns that injure people.  Menahem ben Seruk listed it with (Job 5:5), "Carrying it off in baskets [mitzinim]."  However, I explain it as an expression of (Prov. 25:13), "the cold [tzinat] of snow," for there, it is written (Job 5:5), "May the hungry devour his harvest, Carrying it off in baskets; May the thirsty swallow their wealth" -- in other words, the hungry, naked -- cold [tzanim] -- and thirsty brigands will take their wealth.

THIS IS THE LAND THAT SHALL FALL TO YOU AS YOUR PORTION.

Verse 33

[NO EXPIATION FOR BLOOD THAT IS SHED] EXCEPT BY THE BLOOD OF THE ONE WHO SHED IT.  I say that it should properly be vocalized with a m'lapum [after the shin], based on its meaning:  "except by the blood of the person who shed the blood."
