<b>The man is cleansed of sin</b> although he caused her this punishment due to his jealousy of her. It seems to me that he is cleansed of sin because he did not tolerate his wife being unfaithful to him. If he had remained silent he would not have been clean of sin, for she would have been prohibited to him.

<b>This concerns the Levites</b>. This refers to a new mitzvah that was not yet stated: Five years before the age of thirty, before he was considered qualified to carry the holy utensils, the Levite was commanded to guard the <i>Mishkon</i> and its utensils. From the age of fifty and over, when he was no longer suitable for carrying, he would again be suitable for guarding.

Verse 1


<b>For he married a Cushite woman</b>. It says in Divrei HaYamim that Moshe was a king in Cush for forty years. There, he took a woman to be queen but never had conjugal relations with her. Miriam and Aharon, however, did not know that he never had relations with her when they spoke about him. This is the main explanation according to the plain meaning. If, however, one were to assert they were speaking about Tzipora, why does the verse need to explain that she was a Cushite woman? Haven’t we already been informed that Tzipora was a Midyanite? Moreover, it can be asserted that Tzipora was not a Cushite at all, because Cush was one of the sons of Cham, and Midyan was one of the sons of Ketura and Avraham.

Verse 2

<b>Each leader among them.</b> The plain explanation is that these twelve men should be taken from those among the Bnei Yisroel who have the desire to go. The nation was to be asked: Who wants to go and spy the Land? From among those who wanted to go, Moshe would choose twelve men. Hashem did not specify their names, because the men who went would have to be brave and not afraid or weak-hearted, worthy of traveling to a strange land. They would have to strengthen themselves and take from the fruit of the land, as well. Therefore, Moshe was instructed to make an announcement.

<b>If you put those people’s eyes out.</b> Do you think that the people who are complaining about you do not have eyes to see how you have failed them? You took us out of Egypt, a good land, to die in the desert, and you never fulfilled your condition for taking us out of Egypt, which was to bring us to a land flowing with milk and honey. Rather, during the forty years we will all die in the desert. 
Therefore, we will not go up to you.

<b>A blossom came forth.</b> When Moshe took it out he found that it had only blossomed and nothing more, as it says, “And behold! The staff of Aharon blossomed.” 
However, afterwards, “it bloomed buds” in front of the entire people of Israel, and then it “bore ripe almonds.” If this had happened previously in the Sanctuary, then the blossoming and buds would not have been seen, and also, the Torah would have only written that it bore almonds and not “behold, the staff of Aharon blossomed”.

<b>Towards sorcery.</b> To try one place after another that perhaps he would be able to curse them. Now, however, his intention was to bless them wholeheartedly. Therefore the verse says here (v. 2), and the spirit of Hashem rested upon him. The spirit of Hashem rested upon him out of love, as a show of affection.

Verse 3

<b>He may not profane his word.</b> This refers to the vow. He should not delay his vow until after the Festivals. The connotation of לא יחל is as in (Shoftim 3:25): “And they tarried until it was late”; (Bereishis 8:10): “He waited another seven days” and (Tehillim 130:7): “Yisroel, hope to Adonoy”—wait for and expect Him. One who explains this in the plain meaning as a language of profanation is in error.
