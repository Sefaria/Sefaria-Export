Ateret Zekeinim

Title



Introduction



Index

This is the chapter index for this treatise: CHAPTER 1 - The first question that requires interpretation: (Exodus 23:20) "Behold, I am sending an angel before you..." I bring up Rashi's opinion, and I bring up powerful refutations of his opinion. I also [describe] the Midrash's opinion and my questions on it.
CHAPTER 2 - The second question: Why didn't Moses, peace be unto him, pray at this point that an angel should not go [and should instead be him alone who goes]? And the opinion of Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra and Nachmanides' response. And also, Rabbeinu Nissim's opinion, and the powerful questions against their opinions.
CHAPTER 3 - The third question on this portion: When will this prediction be practically fulfilled? I bring Maimonides' opinion from the Guide (Guide for the Perplexed, Part 2 34:1), I explain what he says, and I bring refutations against his opinion from the straightforward reading of Scripture. I also [describe] the Midrash and my questions on it.
