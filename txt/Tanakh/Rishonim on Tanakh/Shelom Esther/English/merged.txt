Shelom Esther

Introduction



Many ask why the name of God's existence was not written in this scroll, like it is written in the other holy books. And there is someone who answered that it is since it is already hinted to by way of an anagram. However the difficulty remains in place; why was it not written explicitly? That is why R. Avraham Ibn Ezra answers that it is since this scroll would in the future be written in the ordinances of Persia and Media. So it is, lest in place of His name, may He be blessed, they would put the name of their idolatry, as the Kuthites did, since they wrote it [as] Ashimah. But there is a difficulty with his explanation: As, if so, it would  not have been fitting that it be written even in Daniel and Ezra, since [they] were also destined to be written in the ordinances of Persia and Media; but in spite of this, they were not concerned and it was written. So they should have done the same here and written it! 
For this reason, there is someone who says that the name of His existence is only mentioned with miracles that were the opposite of nature, as it was with Daniel and Channaniah. However here, even though the Holy One, blessed be He, caused the great and wonderous causes - which are the wine party, the killing of Vashti, etc. - it was all according to nature. That is why it is not written. But this is not likely, since some of the miracles that were done for the Jewish people in Egypt were according to nature and nevertheless had the name of [His] existence mentioned with them. And the Ramban [answers] that it is because the miracle was done outside the land [of Israel], so it is not fitting to write His name, may He be blessed. But there is a difficulty with his explanation, since all of the miracles that are written in the Torah were done outside the land, and yet it was written nevertheless.
Some say that its content is similar to that of a Torah scroll, and that is enough. But where is it hinted? Some say where it is written (Esther 4:14), "<b>from another place (<i>makom</i>)</b>." As "<i>Makom</i> is nothing other than the Holy One, blessed be He. And others say it is in (Esther 5:4), "<b>y</b>avo <b>h</b>amelekh <b>v</b>eHaman <b>h</b>ayom, (spelling out the name of God as an anagram). And [still] others say it is in (Esther 7:8), "oupne<b>i H</b>aman chaf<b>u</b>. And it is written that way (the anagram is missing the last letter), since the wicked reverse the trait of mercy (alluded to by this name of God) into (strict) justice. This is like the matter of that which they, may their memory be blessed, said on the verse (Exodus 9:3), "Behold, the hand of the Lord is." And that is why it is written by hinting to it; since the Holy One, blessed be He does not attach His Name to evil.
 And I, the humble Yitzchak Gershon the writer, will say a correct explanation if it appears so to the One who knows knowledge: For it is true that His name, may He be blessed, will not be complete until the breach of Amalek will be breached. As it is written (Exodus 17:16), "the Lord will be at war with Amalek," meaning He will fight with Him with the name of His existence, such that the trait of mercy (associated with that name) will reverse itself to be cruel to the point that they will not leave over [any] infants. And then on that day, 'His name will be one and He will be one.' And hence even though the evil Haman was killed, there was still of that wicked offspring left in the world. Therefore the name of [His] existence should not be written explicitly, but rather hinted to. And if you are precise, you will find that in "<b>y</b>avo <b>h</b>amelekh," the name of <i>Yod-hay</i>; and the [second] half of the name that will be filled in the future is written in the name of the evil Haman. As He will avenge Himself from him and his offspring in the future. And that is why <i>vav-hay</i> is written at the beginning of his name, "<i><b>v</b>e<b>H</b>aman</i>." That is to say that the name of [His] existence is prepared for vengeance against him. And that is why the name of [His] existence is not written here.
