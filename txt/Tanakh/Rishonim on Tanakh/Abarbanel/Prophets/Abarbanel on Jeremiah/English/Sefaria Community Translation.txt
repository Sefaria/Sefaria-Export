Abarbanel on Jeremiah

Introduction







Chapter 1



Verse 1

The first prophecy begins from the beginning of the book of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, and concludes with the phrase, "the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, in the days of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah." This prophecy contains five sections. The first is "the words of Jeremiah." The second is "before I formed you in the womb." The third is "what do you see, Jeremiah?" The fourth is "a boiling pot." The fifth is "going and calling." And behold, I have asked about these five questions in the verses of this prophecy, following my usual method in interpreting the words of the prophets.
The first question is whether the verse intends to inform us during which kings Jeremiah prophesied. Why is it not sufficient to say that he prophesied during the days of Josiah, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah, kings of Judah, as explained in Isaiah, Hosea, and other prophets? And what is the need to specify that his prophecy began in the thirteenth year of Josiah and continued until the eleventh year of Zedekiah, since in the case of other prophets, the Scripture mentions the time of the kings during which they prophesied but does not specify the number of years of their reigns? Furthermore, if Jeremiah began prophesying during the days of Josiah and his prophecy continued until the end of Zedekiah's reign, why does the verse mention Jehoiachin, who was a middle king between them, and why does it not also mention Jehoahaz, who reigned before Jehoiakim, and Jehoiachin, who reigned before Zedekiah?
The second question is why did the Almighty say to Jeremiah at the beginning of his prophecy, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you were born, I sanctified you," while such a statement is not mentioned to any other prophet? And if this applies to every prophet as a general rule, as stated by the distinguished Rabbi in Chapter 32, Part Two, why is it specifically mentioned for Jeremiah and not for others? And if the purpose of the verse is to establish a foundation for all the prophets, it would have been more appropriate to mention it with regard to Abraham or our Master Moses, who began their prophecy and its exalted status, rather than Jeremiah, who was one of the later prophets. The response of Rabbi David Kimchi is not satisfactory, as he wrote that because the Almighty knew that Jeremiah would initially refuse his mission, he informed him that he was prepared for prophecy from the womb. However, this explanation is not valid, as our teacher Moses also initially refused his mission, and no similar statement was made to him, and the appearance of the burning bush did not withhold anything from this matter....
The third question relates to the statement, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you were born, I sanctified you." If the meaning of "I knew you" is from a broad perspective, as understood by Rabbi David Kimchi, how is it possible for G-d to have known Jeremiah before his physical development? And if the matter refers to wisdom and knowledge, such that when the foundations were created, G-d knew that Jeremiah's body would eventually be formed from them, then this statement would be superfluous, lacking substance. For indeed, G-d knew all the righteous and all the wicked before they came into existence, so why was this specifically emphasized in relation to Jeremiah? Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the phrase, "Before you came out of the womb, I sanctified you," because sanctity is not merely the separation from impurity and permissible things. If Jeremiah was still in the womb, how could he be sanctified? And the statement, "I appointed you as a prophet to the nations," cannot be understood as Jeremiah prophesying while still in the womb, unless he was proclaiming future events.
The fourth question is: What was the prophet's objection to the statement of G-d, "Behold, I did not know how to speak, for I am a youth"? For G-d's response was, "Do not say, 'I am a youth,' for you shall go to all whom I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak." Although it is true that Moses, our teacher, was prepared for the exalted status of prophecy from birth, and Solomon, the king, attained the level of wisdom, there is no doubt that they still needed time because when they were young, their days of appointment had not yet arrived, neither for prophecy nor for wisdom, for everything has its appointed time.
The fifth question pertains to the inquiry that G-d posed to Jeremiah regarding the almond rod and the boiling pot that He showed him in these two visions, asking, "What do you see?" It would have been fitting for the prophet to respond, "I see what You have shown me, for You are the G-d of my visions." Furthermore, the prophet Amos declared concerning his own visions, "Thus the Lord showed me" (Amos 7:1, 4), and Jeremiah himself also said, "The Lord showed me" (Jeremiah 1:11). Yet, these visions were ascribed to G-d and not attributed to the prophets, and G-d asked them, "What do you see?" Additionally, it is perplexing that in reference to the boiling pot, the word "boiling" is used twice, suggesting that it represents three prophecies rather than just two.
The sixth question: Why are there four prophecies presented here, each consisting of a brief dialogue, and in each of them it is stated, "The word of the Lord came to me, saying"? Why were they not all included in one continuous dialogue? The prophecies are as follows: The first, "Before I formed you in the womb." The second, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And he responds, "I see an almond branch." The third, "What do you see?" And he answers, "I see a boiling pot." The fourth, "Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem." It would have been appropriate to preface each of them with the phrase "The word of the Lord came to me, saying" once, without repeating it, and it is also puzzling why, in the case of the vision of the boiling pot, it is mentioned a second time and not in the subsequent visions. Furthermore, the fourth vision is not mentioned in a sequential order like the others. I will now explain these questions one by one in more detail.
The overall intention of this prophecy and all its five parts and dialogues is to command Jeremiah and urge him in his prophetic mission, to remove any doubts that may have arisen in his heart due to his youth or the urgency and gravity of the task at hand, and to strengthen him to immediately go and fulfill the commandments of his G-d. This will be further elaborated in the verses.
The words of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, come to an end, and the word of the Lord came to me, saying: "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you were born, I sanctified you; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations." (Jeremiah 1:4-5)
Before I have written the explanation of the twelve prophecies, why did the prophecy of Jeremiah begin with the phrase "The words of Jeremiah"? It is because the events described in his book are recorded according to what happened to him, and they are contrary to him. Many times he speaks in his own words. Therefore, he began his book with the phrase "The words of Jeremiah." Similarly, the words of Amos are also introduced as "The words of Amos." The Scripture informed at the beginning of this book and its preface about four matters concerning Jeremiah.
First, he was the son of Hilkiah, and Hilkiah was the son of Shaphan the high priest who found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord during the time of King Josiah. It was from this discovery that the high priest began to prophesy about the future destruction that would occur in Israel, as it is written, "The Lord will bring disaster upon you and upon your people, according to all the words of the book" (2 Kings 22:16). Therefore, Jeremiah, who completed the task, came out from his loins.
Secondly, he was from the city of Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. This was written as a preliminary information for what would be recounted later regarding his experiences with the people of Anathoth.
