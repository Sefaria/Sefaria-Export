Ba'al HaTurim on Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

There is a midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 1), that the reason why [the Torah] opened with a "bet" and not with an "aleph", is because the "bet" has a connotation of blessing ("B"racha), and "aleph" has a connotation of cursing ("A"rirah). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: I will open with a "bet", with a connotation of blessing, and if it would only be that it should be able to be fulfilled! Alternatively: [The reason the Torah opens with a "bet", which equals two in gematria] is because of the two worlds that were created, this world and the world to come. Alternatively: [The reason the Torah opens with a "bet", which equals two in gematria] is because of the two Torahs, the written Torah, and the oral Torah, to teach you that the world was created in the merit of the Torah and its learners. Bereishit: The [same Hebrew] letters as "Bet Resh" [="first house"], meaning the first Temple, as it says (Jeremiah 17:12) "An honorable throne, exalted from the beginning, the place of our Temple." Alternatively: The [same Hebrew] letters as "A' B'Tishrei" [="1st of Tishrei"], which was when the world was created. Alternatively: The [same Hebrew] letters as "Yirei Shabbat" [="Awe of the Sabbath"], to tell you that the world was created in the merit of Shabbat. Alternatively: The [same Hebrew] letters as "Brit Aish" [="Covenant, Fire"], that in the merit of "covenant", which is circumcision, and in the merit of fire, which is the Torah, we will be saved from the judgement of Gehinnom. Alternatively: The [same Hebrew] letters as "Briat Yesh" [="Creation of something/310"], for the creation of 310 worlds for every righteous individual.
"Bereishit Bara": In numerical value, [the letters also equal] "On Rosh Hashanah the world was created."
Bereishit: In numerical value, [the letters also equal] "With the Torah He created", because the world was created because of the Torah which is called "Reshit". Alternatively: In numerical value, [the letters also equal] "6 Orders [of the Mishnah]". Alternatively: The numerical value is "Israel is chosen among the nations", and also in numerical value "613 He created", that He created the world for the sake of Israel keeping the 613 commandments. "Bereishit", He created firmament, land, heavens, sea, abyss. Alternatively: First Elohim saw that Israel would accept His Torah.

Verse 2

<b>Chaos and void (<i>tohu vabohu</i>):</b> [This phrase appears] two [times]. Here, and the other one is (Jeremiah 4:23) "I have seen the earth and behold, it is chaos and void." [This] teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, foresaw the destruction of the Temple when He created the world, [and] that it would be in the year <i>tohu</i> (the letters that are equal to the number, 411); since, behold the first Temple stood for 410 years and was destroyed in the 411th year. And the second Temple stood the numerical equivalent of [the word,] <i>hayita</i> (420), and this is [why it states] "<i>vehaarets haita</i>" ("and the earth was;" which is the phrase that precedes <i>tohu</i> in this verse). And afterwards, [it is written], "darkness," a hint to the exiles. And so is it expounded in Bereishit Rabbah 2:4. Another explanation: "and the earth was chaos and void" has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'two thousand years without Torah.'
<b>And the spirit of God was hovering:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'this is the spirit of messiah.'
<b>And darkness was upon the depths:</b> There are two [places this appears] according to the tradition: here and the other is (Job 38:19) "and darkness, where is its place?" This [refers to] what they stated (Chagigah 11b), that one should not ask, "What is before, what is after?" The explanation of "and darkness, where is its place?" is that one should not ask, "what was the place of darkness [at] first.
<b>And the spirit of God:</b> [This phrase appears] two [times] as a relational [or possessive phrase]. Here, and the other one is (II Chronicles 24:20) "and the spirit of God clothed Zecharya." One could here too read [as if it was written], "and the spirit of God clothed;" the explanation [of which] is that because of His clothing, He said, "let there be light," after which is written, "and there was light." This is what our Rabbis, of blessed memory, expounded (Bereishit Rabbah 3:4), "from a little of his clothing, He created light."

Then Judah approached him: The last letters of these three words create שָׁוֶה (equal.) Judah said to Joseph, "I am equal to you, just as you are a king, I am a king." And for this he demands in the Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 93:6) For behold the kings have assembled (Psalms 48:5).

Verse 1

Then Yaakov called for his son's: He sought to reveal the appointed time for the end but it became concealed from him (Pesachim 56a.) Yaakov asks, "Perhaps there is sin (חטא) among you?" They said, "No, if you examine our names, you will not find the letters ח or ט in them. Then he said unto them, "Arise, there is also no ק or ץ letters (end) in them.
