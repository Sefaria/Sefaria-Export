Introduction



Foreword







Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>Elokim said.</b> “Saying,” in this context, signifies desiring in a purposeful way. <b>And there was light.</b> Regarding the rest of creation Scripture merely states, “It was so.” It could not do so in this instance, however, because unlike the rest of creation the light did not remain in its initial form. The “days” mentioned in this passage were actual days, comprised of hours and minutes; nevertheless, there is a deeper significance to them as well, known in part to the Kabbalists .

Verse 4

<b>Elokim saw.</b> The act of bringing a thing into being is called “saying,” while sustaining it is called “seeing.” This is said after each act of creation in order to teach that nothing can continue to exist unless the Creator wills it.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>And for years.</b> The word <i>shannah</i> — “year” — derives from a root signifying repetition. Thus a <i>shannah</i> is the time that it takes for an astronomical body to repeat its cycle, as the sun does every 365 days and the moon every 30 days.

Verse 24

<b>Animals (<i>beheimah</i>).</b> These are the herbivores, both domesticated and wild. <b>Beasts (<i>chayah</i>).</b> These are carnivores.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>Let us make man.</b> Hashem made man with the help of the earth that He had already created; the earth produced the body while Hashem furnished the soul. <b>In our image.</b> The human being would resemble the earth in his bodily characteristics and the immortal, intangible spiritual world in the attributes of his soul.

Verse 8

<b>Ad-noy Elokim planted.</b> This does not mean that He took trees from elsewhere and planted them here. Rather it means that even before any vegetation had sprouted Hashem designated the site of each tree in the Garden, in contrast to other places where they were allowed to grow with no particular order. Moreover, He decreed that these trees would be eternal.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>You shall not eat from it.</b> That is, from its fruit, for the tree itself was not edible. <b>For on the day you eat from it you will certainly die.</b> That is, you will have incurred the death penalty, not that you will die immediately. A similar usage appears in I <i>Melachim</i> 2:42. According to the Sages, however, if Adam had not sinned he would have indeed been immortal, for the soul is capable of sustaining the body forever and this is what the Creator originally intended.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>That the tree was good for food.</b> She originally thought that Hashem warned against eating it because it was poisonous and bitter, but now she saw that it was healthy and delicious.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>Moving (or “walking”) in the Garden.</b> There are numerous verses in which Hashem is said to “walk” among the righteous (see, for example, <i>Vayikra</i> 26:12) or to depart from them (<i>Bereishis</i> 18:33). These statements refer to the revelation of the Divine Presence and its subsequent departure.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>The woman that You gave.</b> “Since You gave her to me I assumed that whatever she said would be for my good.” In response Hashem tells him, “Because you listened to your wife” (v. 17). That is, “You should not have heeded her advice in violation of My command.” According to the Sages, however, Adam was showing his ingratitude by throwing the responsibility for his sin upon Hashem.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>From reaching out his hand.</b> The fruit of the Tree of Life would have counteracted Adam’s decree of death by prolonging his life either indefinitely or at least beyond his allotted span. Before the sin there was no need to guard the tree because Adam would not have done anything he was not commanded to do.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<b>I have obtained a man with Ad-noy.</b> That is, an heir to serve Hashem in our stead after we are gone.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>Kayin brought.</b> The intellectual giants of those early generations understood the real significance of the sacrifices.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>If you improve, there is forgiveness.</b> Alternatively, “If you improve you will rise [i.e. above your brother].” And after all, it was only jealousy of him that caused you to be angry in the first place. <b>But if you do not improve.</b> Not only will you suffer on account of your brother, but the evil inclination will lead you astray in everything you do. <b>Its desire is unto you.</b> It wishes to cling to you, but you can overcome it. In this passage Hashem teaches Kayin that a person can repent whenever he chooses to.

Verse 8

<b>Kayin said.</b> See Rashi. Alternatively, he said to him, “Let us go out to the field.” Kayin’s intention was that mankind would all be descended from him, or at least not from Hevel, whose offering Hashem had accepted.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>My sin is greater.</b> My sin was indeed unforgivable and Your decree just, nevertheless, <b>whoever finds me will kill me</b>, and You did not sentence me to die. Here Kayin acknowledged that human beings require Divine protection.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Ad-noy placed a mark (or <i>sign</i>).</b> The implication is that the sign was with him at all times. It may have been a Providential device informing him of the safe path. According to the <i>Midrash</i> it was a guide dog.

Verse 16

<b>And settled in the land of Nod.</b> He did not wander about the entire earth but only in the land of Nod. The name “Nod” means “wandering.” The region retained this name thereafter on Kayin’s account.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>Who sharpened.</b> According to the <i>Targum</i> he was the “father” (i.e. forerunner) of those who fashioned copper and iron tools. <b>The sister of Tuval Kayin.</b> According to the <i>Midrash</i> she was Noach’s wife, who was called <i>Naamah</i> — “pleasant one” — because of her righteous deeds. If this is the case then Kayin left progeny in the world.

Chapter 5



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>And he had a son in his likeness.</b> It is usual for offspring to resemble their progenitors. However, since Adam was created in the image of Hashem it was necessary to state that this was true in his case as well.

Verse 4

<b>All the days that Adam lived.</b> Adam was long lived because he was created directly by Hashem in the most perfect form. Something of this perfection remained even after the sin and was passed down to his immediate offspring. After the flood, however, the environment was altered and the life spans of his descendants began to decrease.

Chapter 6



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>The sons of the rulers.</b> According to this rendering those who were charged with establishing justice trampled it openly.
<b>And they took for themselves wives.</b> By force. <b>From whomever they chose.</b> Even married women. Nevertheless, Scripture cites only violent crime (v. 11) as the reason for the flood because it is prohibited by reason alone. <b>My spirit will not continue to judge.</b> Or, “My spirit will not remain within man forever because he is flesh.” If man had sanctified himself, then My spirit would indeed have remained within him. But because he allowed his physical nature to predominate, My spirit will not remain within him. <b>His days shall be.</b> Hashem would nevertheless grant them time to repent.

Verse 3

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Violent crime.</b> Specifically, banditry and injustice. Hashem mentioned to Noach only their violent deeds and not their moral corruption because the former were more commonly known. According to the Sages it was only on account of these that their verdict was sealed. This is because they are proscribed even by unaided reason. Moreover, they offend both God and man.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>From all flesh.</b> The numbers of species is enormous and many are of great size. Considering also the provisions required to feed them it is clear that the ark could not have held them all without a miracle. This being the case it could have been smaller, but Hashem wanted people to see it and inquire and perhaps repent. He also wanted to minimize the miracle. Some have suggested that the <i>amohs</i> (forearm lengths) mentioned here were proportional to Noach’s body. But if Noach’s <i>amah</i> was larger than today’s, so were the people and animals, so nothing is gained. In any event, the <i>amohs</i> referred to were standard Torah <i>amohs</i>. <b>To keep them alive with you.</b> He was required not only to bring them to the ark but to see to their welfare just as he saw to his own.

Verse 23

<b>[He] obliterated (<i>vayimach</i>).</b> After stating that all flesh perished and that everything on dry land died, Scripture adds that even the bodies were obliterated. The word <i>vayimach</i> signifies dissolving.

Chapter 8



Verse 1

<b>Elokim remembered.</b> That is, He called to mind Noach’s righteousness. Noach’s sons are not mentioned because they were saved only in his merit. The “remembering” of the animals, however, cannot refer to merit, since this is relevant only to human beings. Rather it means that Hashem recalled His initial desire in creating the world and His desire that it endure.

Verse 9

<b>The dove found no rest.</b> Birds do not usually alight upon barren mountaintops. That is why it found no suitable resting place until the treetops were exposed.

Chapter 9



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>Every moving creature.</b> This included beasts, birds and fish.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>From the hand of every beast.</b> This seems to imply that they would be punished, yet reward and punishment are only relevant with regard to intelligent beings. Apparently it is simply Divine fiat that any creature that kills a human being shall be killed.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>Be fruitful and multiply.</b> The similar statements to Adam (1:28) and to Noach (9:1) were merely blessings, but this one is a command. The continuation, “spread … and multiply,” is an exhortation to fulfill the command with all one’s power. Alternatively, it is an injunction to populate the entire globe.

Verse 8

<b>To Noach and to his sons.</b> Noach’s sons were not prophets but Hashem spoke to them through their father.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>This is the sign.</b> This seems to imply that there was never a rainbow before this time. Alternatively, the rainbow always existed but from now on it would serve as a sign. The “bow” is directed upward rather than downward to indicate that Heaven will not shoot its “arrows” at mankind.

<b>In the land of his birth.</b> Only Haran was born in Ur Kasdim. Terach was originally from Aram where his older sons Avram and Nachor were born. Afterwards Terach took Avram with him to Ur Kasdim while Nachor remained behind. That is why when Terach left to return to Aram (v. 31) Nachor is not mentioned.

Chapter 12

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>To Ad-noy Who had appeared.</b> That is, to give thanks to God for appearing to him. This was the first actual vision he had experienced. The command to go to Canaan came to him in a dream or some lesser form of prophecy.

Verse 8

<b>And he proclaimed.</b> He proclaimed God’s Name aloud so that all would hear it. Yitzchak did the same when he came to Beer Sheva (26:25). Yaakov, however, did not need to publicize God’s name in this way because the mere presence of his large family was publicity enough.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>There was a famine.</b> This foreshadowed what was to befall Avraham’s descendants: They too were to descend into Egypt because of famine. Their women would be taken as Pharaoh had taken Sarah. The Egyptians would be stricken with plagues as Pharaoh was in Avraham’s time, after which the Israelites would leave with great wealth as Avraham did, with the Egyptians actually urging them to go.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Pharaoh’s official’s saw her.</b> They declared that she was fitting for Pharaoh. The official’s were afraid to touch her themselves, knowing that Pharaoh would desire her.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>That I should take her to myself.</b> He had intended to make her his queen, not just another concubine. He told Avraham this so that if she was really his sister he would admit it.

Chapter 13



Verse 1

<b>He, his wife and all that he had.</b> Miraculously, the Egyptians did not take back the gifts they had given him in exchange for Sarah, even though they could have claimed they were given under false pretenses.

Chapter 14



Verse 1

<b>This happened in the days.</b> These four kings foreshadowed the four kingdoms that would have dominion over Israel — Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome. But in the end Israel would be victorious over them.

<b>King of Shaleim.</b> I.e., Yerushalayim; see <i>Tehillim</i> 76:3. “Malki Zedek” means “King of Righteousness”; see also <i>Yehoshua</i> 10:1. People knew even then that this place was special.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>I have lifted my hand.</b> Avraham vowed that whatever he took from the spoils would be dedicated to God, like the tithe he gave to Malki Zedek.

<b>But also that nation.</b> Even though God Himself decreed enslavement and oppression for Avram’s descendants, their oppressors would be punished for overstepping the sentence. If, on the other hand, they had only intended to carry out the sentence they would have been rewarded.

Chapter 16



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Sarai … took.</b> Avram waited until Sarah herself brought Hagar to him. <b>Avram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</b> Even though Avram was eager for an heir he did not take a second wife until Sarah gave permission and even then his intention was only to please her or to give her the merit of bringing a competitor into the house so that she herself might conceive. <b>The wife of Avram … to Avram her husband.</b> Sarah did not despair of bearing children herself but continued acting as Avram’s wife. <b>To be his wife.</b> Sarah, out of concern for her husband’s dignity, did not want Hagar to be a concubine but a wife.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>You shall name him Yishmael.</b> See verse 15. The angel told Hagar to name him herself but as a mere concubine she was afraid that would be too audacious. So she revealed the matter to Avram and he named him.

Chapter 17



Verse 1

<b>Shaddai.</b> That is, the One who is able to manipulate the astrological framework. This is the Name through which Hashem performs hidden miracles and it was through this name that He would grant Avraham offspring.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>And I will make you into nations.</b> See Rashi. It does not seem likely, however, that Hashem would have mentioned Avraham’s uncircumcised Edomite descendants just as Avraham was about to undergo circumcision. Rather, the Israelites themselves are referred to as “nations” (35:11) and “peoples” (<i>Devarim</i> 33:19).

Verse 17

<b>And laughed.</b> Avraham did not laugh in disbelief but in joy at the wondrous news. <b>Can a hundred year old man.</b> There is nothing miraculous about an elderly man fathering a child. It was only surprising in this case because they had been childless for so long.

Verse 18

<b>May it be granted that Yishmael live.</b> God had promised Avraham a single heir (15:4), whom Avraham presumed to be Yishmael. Now that he heard that his heir was to come from Sarah he was afraid that Yishmael would die.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Because it is for this reason.</b> Since your journey takes you this way it is only fitting that you stop to rest in my home. <b>Do as you have said.</b> They politely assured him that plain bread was indeed sufficient. Alternatively, they accepted his suggestion that they rest for a short while and then continue on, but insisted that he not delay them longer.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>Avraham ran to the cattle.</b> Avraham had at least 318 servants (14:14) and was elderly and weak from his circumcision, yet he tended to all these matters personally out of his love of kindness.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>Well on in years.</b> Literally, “coming in years.” A young person is said to “stand” in his years, but one who has outlived his contemporaries is said to “come” into years as a traveler comes into a new town.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>Is anything too far removed.</b> After all, everything is in Hashem’s hands. Onkelos, however, renders this phrase, “Is anything <i>hidden</i> from Hashem?”.

Verse 15

<b>Sarah denied it.</b> She did not realize that they were angels. In fact, she may not have seen them at all.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>Avraham is indeed to become.</b> In view of what he is to become, how can I conceal what I am about to do? Future generations will wonder why I did so and might even suppose that he knew but did not act! Moreover, only good can come of his knowing — either he will find merit for the sinners and pray that I spare them, or he will find none and then he too will desire that justice be done.

Verse 19

<b>For I have given him special attention.</b> Alternatively, “I have raised him up.” <b>Because he commands.</b> Alternatively, “In order that he will command” — Thus, Hashem raised him up in order that his descendants would serve Him.

Verse 26

<b>Within the city.</b> Even if they are originally from elsewhere. Avraham was hoping that there were other righteous immigrants like Lot.

Chapter 19



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Get up early and continue.</b> Knowing what his neighbors were like Lot warned them not to remain in the town after daybreak, not imagining they would be accosted at night. Alternatively, he assumed his guests would wish to set out early to reach their destination.

Verse 3

<b>Elokim remembered.</b> Because Lot accompanied Avraham on all his travels he was saved in Avraham’s merit. Moreover, if he had not gone with Avraham he would still be safe in Charan rather in Sedom.

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32

<b>That we may give life … from our father.</b> Perhaps Hashem will have mercy upon us and grant us a boy and a girl to replenish the earth. Although a Noachide is permitted to marry his daughter they were too modest to ask him to do so directly. Alternatively, even then it was considered disgraceful.

Chapter 20



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>She is my sister.</b> Unlike the Egyptians, Avimelech and his people were trustworthy, so Avraham’s precaution was unnecessary. <b>Avimelech … sent.</b> When Pharaoh took Sarah she was only sixty-five but by now she was ninety! Apparently youth was restored to her when the angel informed her of her impending conception.

Verse 17

<b>In the place where he is.</b> Hashem provided their deliverance right where they were, without the need to travel elsewhere to find water.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

<b>Elokim tested Avraham.</b> Hashem knows whether a person will pass a test or not, but He tests the righteous for their own benefit, because the reward for deed is greater than for intention.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>And saw the place.</b> He saw the cloud attached to the mountain and took it to be the fulfillment of Hashem’s statement, “which I will designate to you.” Alternatively, he saw ahead of him the land of Moriah, with which he was already familiar. (22:9) "And they came to the place that the Lord said to him" now, which is Mount Moriah. For He said to him, "Behold, this is the mountain that I told you."

<b>Because you performed this deed.</b> Although he was already promised that his offspring would be like the stars (15:5) and the dust (13:16), Hashem now swore that they would inherit their enemies. Thus even if they sinned they would never be destroyed and would eventually be redeemed.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>It was told to Avraham.</b> These were especially glad tidings because not only was Nachor his older brother, but Milkah was the daughter of his deceased brother Haran (11:29). <b>Milkah has also born children.</b> If they were born to Nachor in his youth Avraham would have known about them already, because he did not leave Charan until he was seventy-five and in any event Canaan was not far away. Thus Nachor and Milkah were also granted children in their old age.

<b>The son of Milkah.</b> And not the son of Nachor’s concubine, Re’umah. Since Rivkah mentions her grandmother before her grandfather, Scripture does as well (see v. 15). But Eliezer tactfully emends her statement when relating it to her family in verse 47.

Verse 8

<b>His sons Yitzchok and Yishmael.</b> Avraham informed Yishmael of Hashem’s decree that although he was his son in all other ways, with respect to Yitzchok it was as if he was a stranger. From the fact that he accepted this bitter message the Sages derived that he was a true penitent.

Verse 33

<b>Swear to me.</b> Yaakov made him swear that he would not ask him to return the birthright in the future. Afterwards the transaction was completed and Yaakov paid him either with cash or the pottage. Alternatively, Yaakov made him swear that he would never challenge the validity of the sale.

Chapter 26



Verse 1

<b>Yitzchok went to Avimelech.</b> Yitzchok hoped that Avimelech, as his father’s ally, would offer him refuge so that he would not have to go to Egypt. As it turned out, Avimelech did refrain from abusing him. Moreover, although people asked about Rivkah they did not touch her because they recalled the incident with Sarah.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>I will keep (or, “establish”) the oath.</b> Hashem did not need to assure him that He would keep His oath. Rather, this was a way of extending the oath to Yitzchok as well. In fact, Scripture records that He swore to all three Patriarchs (<i>Shemos</i> 33:1). This was to show that each of them was worthy on his own. It also enabled their descendants to draw upon the merits of all three.

<b>My mandate (literally, “My guarding”).</b> That is, he guarded the true faith in his heart, in the name of which he disputed the idolaters and called upon others to worship Hashem. <b>My commandments.</b> He had done whatever Hashem had commanded him — including leaving his homeland, sacrificing his son and banishing his maidservant and her son. <b>My decrees.</b> He had emulated Hashem’s ways through the performance of mercy and justice, etc., and had instructed his children to do likewise. <b>My teachings (“Toros” in Hebrew).</b> He had circumcised himself and his sons and observed the seven Noachide laws, which for those generations was the “Torah”.

<b>He shall be blessed.</b> This was not an additional blessing but a statement of fact — Yitzchok sensed that his deceiver was already blessed or that his own blessings had taken effect whether he wanted them to or not. Thus the reason for his trembling was that he realized that his beloved son Eisov had lost the blessings forever.

Verse 41

<b>The days … are approaching.</b> Eisov did not wish to pain his father by killing his brother in his lifetime. Alternatively, he was afraid that his father would curse him. Nevertheless, Rivkah was afraid that Yitzchok might die suddenly or that Eisov would find an opportune moment to kill Yaakov.

<b>To my master, Eisov.</b> It is usual for a younger sibling to speak with deference to the first born. Yaakov, however, had purchased the right of the firstborn, which is why Eisov hated him.

<b>Devorah, Rivkah’s nurse, died.</b> See Rashi in the name of the <i>Aggadah</i>. This explains why in v. 27 only Yitzchok is mentioned. Another explanation for the concealing of Rivkah’s death is that her funeral was not an honorable one: Yaakov was absent, Eisov hated her and Yitzchok was blind.

Chapter 36



Chapter 37



Verse 1

<b>In the land of his father’s residence (<i>megurim).</i></b> <i>Megurim</i> implies residing as a foreigner. In contrast to Eisov, Yitzchok and Yaakov preferred dwelling in the Holy Land even as foreigners to living abroad. This was a fulfillment of the decree that Avraham’s descendants would be “foreigners in a land that is not theirs” (15:13).

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>A son of his old age.</b> Actually, <i>all</i> of Yaakov’s sons were born to him in his old age. It was the custom, however, that an elderly father would take one of his younger sons to serve him. That is why Yoseif did not tend the flocks like the others.
