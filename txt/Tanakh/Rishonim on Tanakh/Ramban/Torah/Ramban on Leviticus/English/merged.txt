Ramban on Leviticus

Introduction

‘VAYIKRA’ (AND HE CALLED).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>And G-d called unto Moses</i>. — The third book of the Torah thus receives its title from the first Hebrew word of the book. The English title Leviticus is derived from the Septuagint — the first Greek translation of the Bible — which gave it that name because a major part of the book is devoted to the laws relating to the priests and Levites. In the Talmud and related literature it is called Torath Kohanim (Law of the Priests). This is to be distinguished from the early Rabbinic commentary on the book, known also as Torath Kohanim. See further, Notes 65, 73, and 121.</i> This book is the law of the priests and the Levites.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 25:32: <i>But as for the cities of the Levites</i> etc.</i> In it G-d explains matters concerned with all the offerings and watching over the Tabernacle [that it should not become defiled].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 15:31: <i>Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</i>. The reference could not be to the actual guarding of the Tabernacle done by the priests and Levites every night throughout the night, (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 31-32), for that duty is mentioned in the Book of Numbers (18:4). It may possibly be also a hint to the special Service on the Day of Atonement which was designed to atone for any uncleanness that may have occurred in the Tabernacle or any part thereof (see further 16:16, and 33). By bringing the prescribed offerings on that day Israel fulfilled its duty of “watching over the Tabernacle” that it should not continue in its state of defilement but instead should be restored to its pristine purity and holiness.</i> This is because one book [i.e., the second book of the Torah] was dedicated to the Egyptian exile and the redemption therefrom, and He completed it with an account of the building of the Tent of Meeting and the Glory of G-d which filled the Tabernacle,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:34.</i> therefore He now commanded Moses about the offerings and about watching over the Tabernacle, in order that the offerings effect atonement for [the children of] Israel, and that their sins should not bring about the removal of the Divine Glory. Thus He commanded <i>the priests that come near unto the Eternal</i> that <i>they sanctify themselves</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 19:22.</i> warning them against defilement of the Sanctuary and its hallowed offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban further, 5:2.</i> and also that they are not <i>to break through to come up unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:24. Ramban’s thought there is clearly based on his exposition [at the beginning of <i>Seder Terumah</i> — <i>ibid.</i>, 25:1, Vol. II, pp. 435-436] that the Tabernacle constituted a continuation of the presence of the Divine Glory which had descended upon Mount Sinai. Ramban therefore continues here to show that the strictures which applied at the time of the Revelation find their parallels in the laws concerning the Tabernacle.</i> just as He said, <i>Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the ark-cover which is upon the ark, that he die not; for I appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:2.</i> which is similar to the warning [given at the Revelation] <i>lest they break through unto the Eternal to gaze, and many of them perish</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:21.</i> After that<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the Book of Numbers (5:1-3). See Ramban there on Verse 2.</i> He set limits to the Tabernacle, even as He had marked off Mount Sinai when the Glory of the G-d of Israel was there.
Thus the greatest part of this book deals with the offerings, the laws of the offering itself and of those who perform its rite and of the place where it is to be brought; some commandments are also mentioned incidentally to those dealing with the offerings. Thus at first He commanded concerning the freewill offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Freewill offerings are those which can be brought at any time by any individual. These include: the burnt-offering (Chapter 1), the meal-offering (Chapter 2), and the peace-offering (Chapter 3). On the other hand, the sin-offering (Chapter 4) and the guilt-offering (Chapter 5:14-26) can be brought only to expiate certain sins if committed unintentionally, and therefore are not freewill offerings.</i> and prohibited the eating of fat and blood on account of [mentioning] them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 3:17.</i> Following that He commanded concerning the offerings that are to be brought upon committing a sin,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapters 4-5.</i> and incidentally to these He mentioned the laws of forbidden foods;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 11.</i> for they defile the person, and he who eats them or touches them must not touch any hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary, and if he does go in there [or eat of the hallowed things] while in a state of uncleanness, he has to bring the offering of higher or lower value<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This offering was so called [the offering of higher or lower value] because it did not have to be of one specified kind, but varied in accordance with the means of the transgressor who has to offer it. See in my translation of Rambam’s “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 82-83.</i> which He had already mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 5:1-13.</i> After that it was necessary to mention the law of the leper<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapters 13-14.</i> and the ordinances of the woman in childbirth<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 12.</i> and of the <i>zav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A man suffering a flux. <i>Ibid.</i>, 15:1-15.</i> and <i>zavah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A woman suffering a flux outside her menstrual period. <i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 25-30.</i> in order to tell that they must bring an offering [at the end of the period of their uncleanness], and to warn them further concerning their uncleanness — as He said at the end [of these laws], <i>Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> As a result of mentioning these laws, He warned afterwards about those persons with whom it is forbidden to have sexual relations,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 18.</i> since association with them defiles, and their sin is called “defilement”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24: <i>Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things</i>.</i> and brings about the removal of the Divine Glory, and exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:31-32.</i> Besides, he who commits any of these sins [of forbidden sexual relations] unwillfully, must bring the sin-offering which He mentioned already in the verse, <i>And if anyone sin through error</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:27.</i> Following that He mentioned the commandment of the Sabbath and the appointed seasons of the Eternal<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 23.</i> on account of the offerings [which are brought on those days], just as He said, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i> etc. <i>to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 37.</i> In most of the sections of this book He speaks with reference to the priests: <i>Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 22:18.</i> <i>Command Aaron and his sons</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:2.</i> In the section of <i>Kedoshim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Chapters 19-20.</i> however, there are some commandments addressed to the children of Israel, but most of them are mentioned because of some connection with the offerings or matters similar to them. I will explain them in their place with the help of the Holy One, blessed be He.





Chapter 1



Verse 1

AND HE CALLED UNTO MOSES; AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO HIM. Scripture states [the fact that G-d called to Moses] here and not in other places, because <i>Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:35.</i> and to draw near the place <i>where G-d was</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 20:18.</i> except through G-d calling him [to come into the Tent of Meeting]. For Moses had already been told, <i>and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25:22.</i> <i>where I will meet with thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 30:36.</i> Since he knew that <i>the Eternal that sitteth upon the cherubim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I Chronicles 13:6.</i> was there, Moses was afraid to come into the Tent at all until He called him, just as it was at Mount Sinai where it is said, <i>and on the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:16. See also Note 7 above.</i> Or it may be that Moses did not know that the Glory of G-d was in the Tent and that the communication to him would be from there,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For Moses thought that he would hear the Divine Voice speaking to him from above the ark-cover, but actually the Holy One, blessed be He, would be speaking from heaven (Abohab). See also Ramban on Exodus 40:2, Vol. II, p. 619.</i> since the cloud did not cover the Tent of Meeting until the eighth day of the installation according to the opinion of our Rabbis;<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>And it came to pass, on the eighth day</i> … (Further 9:1). This was the first of Nisan, and the day was distinguished in ten different ways … It was the day on which the Divine Glory dwelt for the first time among the Israelites …” (Torath Kohanim, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> and after this call Moses came into the innermost part of the Tent [i.e., the Holy of Holies], just as the Rabbis have interpreted:<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim at the beginning of <i>Parshath Acharei</i>, (further, 16:2): “<i>Thy brother</i> [Aaron] is under the command not to enter the holy place [except when it was his duty to officiate there], (further 16:2), but Moses is not included in this command.”</i> “Aaron was not to enter [the Sanctuary except at the prescribed time], but Moses was not included in this command.” This is the plain meaning of this verse. I have explained it already above.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:34.</i><br>But our Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 1:7.</i> that “all communications [that came to Moses], whether they are introduced by the word <i>dabeir</i> (speak), or by <i>emor</i> (say), or <i>tzav</i> (command), were preceded by a call,” that is to say, G-d said to him, ‘<i>Moses, Moses</i>’ and he answered, ‘<i>Here am I</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 3:4.</i> This was a way of expressing affection and encouragement to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Accordingly, the call to Moses that is mentioned at the beginning of this book was not for the purpose of giving him permission to come into the Tent of Meeting, but rather to express G-d’s affection for Moses and His inspiriting him for the communication. If so, it stands to reason, Ramban continues, that this kind of call [“Moses, Moses”] came to him on all occasions when he received a Divine communication. The reason why it is mentioned specifically here, etc. (see text).</i> Now according to this opinion, Scripture mentioned the expression [<i>And He called unto him</i> …] here, because it was the first communication that came to Moses from the Tent of Meeting, thus teaching us concerning all the other communications that such was His procedure with him all the time and with the whole Torah. The expression <i>out of the Tent of Meeting</i> refers according to the Rabbis to the preceding words, [the interpretation of the verse thus being]: “and He called unto him out of the Tent of Meeting; and the Eternal spoke to him in the Tent,” for Moses was already there [in the Tent].<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For since the purpose of the call was not to give permission to Moses to enter, but rather to show him affection, the sense of the verse may then be explained as follows: “and G-d called him out of the Tent and He spoke to him in the Tent” where he already was.</i> The explanation of the verse according to its plain meaning and sense is: “and the Eternal called unto Moses and spoke unto him, out of the Tent of Meeting.”<br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], this verse is like, <i>And unto Moses He said: ‘Come up unto the Eternal.’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:1.</i> Its secret is known from the Revelation on Mount Sinai<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See Note 17 in <i>Seder Yithro</i> (Vol. II, p. 251).</i> and the Ten Commandments. I have alluded to it already.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:1.</i>

Verse 2

WHEN ANY MAN BRINGETH OF YOU AN OFFERING UNTO THE ETERNAL OF THE CATTLE. The meaning of this verse is as follows: “when any man of you brings from the cattle an offering to the Eternal, of the herd or of the flock you shall bring it.” The reason for this command is that since He commanded afterwards concerning fowl-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verses 14-17.</i> and meal-offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 2.</i> He said here that when a man brings an offering of cattle, he must bring it of one of these two kinds [herd and flock], but not a wild beast nor any other cattle. Thus he who offers a beast [as an offering to G-d], violates a prohibition which is derived from a positive commandment [and carries the force of a positive commandment], just as the Rabbis have said in the third chapter of Tractate Zebachim:<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 34a.</i> “Rabbi Yochanan said: one who offers the limbs of a [kosher] beast [upon the altar of G-d] transgresses a positive commandment.”
‘TAKRIVU’ (YE SHALL BRING). This teaches that two [or more] persons may bring a freewill burnt-offering in partnership. YOUR OFFERING. This teaches that a burnt-offering may be brought as a freewill offering of the [entire] public [not only of groups of individuals]. This refers to the burnt-offering of the altar’s summertime<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">When there was a lack of private offerings [due to the long summer days], freewill burnt-offerings were supplied from the surplus of the half-shekels of the previous year.</i> which was supplied from the surplus [of the half-shekels of the past year].” This is Rashi’s language.<br>The meaning of the Rabbi’s interpretation is thus to state that if many persons voluntarily offer to bring a burnt-offering, it thereby becomes a burnt-offering of partners, for what difference is there between two persons who combine to bring an offering, and ten or a thousand who associate to do so? But the burnt-offering for the altar’s summer-time which is supplied from the surplus [of the previous year’s half-shekels], is deemed a “burnt-offering of the public” because the authorities [of the Sanctuary who receive the donations for the offerings] do so with the implied condition [that they may spend them at their discretion, and the burnt-offering of the public is distinguished in certain respects from a burnt-offering of partners]. Thus according to Rashi all burnt-offerings that are brought by many persons — except those which come from the surplus of the half-shekels — have the law of burnt-offerings of partners, and they all require the laying of [their owners’] hands upon the offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See Verse 4.</i> and the libations connected with them<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 15:3-12.</i> are taken from the owners [while “burnt-offerings of the public” need no laying of hands, and the libations are supplied by the Temple treasury]. Perhaps according to the opinion of Rashi it is permitted for the general public to offer [money] beforehand in order to bring a burnt-offering of fowls, which may be brought as a freewill offering by two [or more] persons but may [never] come as a freewill offering of the public, and similarly they [may combine to bring] a peace-offering, concerning which the Sages have said<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 6:6.</i> that it may be brought by partners as a freewill offering but may not be brought by the public<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Peace-offerings of the public were only brought on the Festival of Shevuoth (see further, 23:19).</i> — and in that case it is called “a burnt-offering of partners,” or “a peace-offering of partners.” They [i.e., the burnt-offering of fowls and the peace-offering], were only excluded in that they cannot be brought from the [money of the] baskets [containing the surplus of half-shekels which were already donated by the public for the general upkeep of the offerings, and not specifically donated for a burnt-offering or peace-offering].<br>We may possibly say that if the public wanted originally to set aside a fund for freewill offerings, and they collected it [for that purpose] as they collected the <i>shekalim</i> for the Daily [public] Offerings and the Additional Offerings [of Sabbaths and festivals], that there may then be a freewill public-offering of the cattle,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the freewill public burnt-offering for the altar’s summertime need not be limited exclusively to that brought out of the surplus in the baskets containing the previous year’s shekels. Money may be collected originally from the public for the purpose of bringing a freewill offering, and the offering will have the status of a public-offering in the sense that [like a public burnt-offering] it will not need the laying of hands on it, which is required in the case of an individual offering. Thus Ramban differs from Rashi’s opinion above that even the combination of a large group of individuals does not alter the status of the offering, which remains an offering of individual partners. Or it may be that Ramban means that even according to Rashi, if the community agreed beforehand, and the money was not left to be donated individually, but collected in the same way that the <i>shekalim</i> were collected, it thereby gains the status of a public-offering. Hence Ramban’s expression: “We may possibly say”, i.e., in explanation of Rashi.</i> and it will not require the laying of hands on it, being that it is included in this verse [as a public offering]. As long as it is the majority of Israel who donated money to that end, the offering is called “a freewill offering of the public.” [This rule applies only to the freewill burnt-offering of the cattle] but does not apply to the burnt-offering of fowls, nor to the peace-offering. But if a minority of the people donated towards the freewill burnt-offering, [even if they are a large group], they are deemed as individuals [who bring such an offering in partnership, which would thus require the laying on it of the owners’ hands, and the libations would have to be supplied by the owners]. This is the correct explanation.

Verse 3



Verse 4

AND HE SHALL LAY HIS HAND. This means his two hands, for we find it stated: <i>and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:10.</i> <i>and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 15.</i> and the Rabbis interpreted it to mean: “the hands of each and every individual.”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the word “hands” does not refer to “Aaron and his sons,” thus implying that each lay one hand, but to each individual laying his two hands on the offering. The source of this interpretation is unknown to me.</i> Thus [it is clear that] both hands were required for it. In the case of the goat designed to be sent [to Azazel] it is expressly stated, <i>And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:21.</i> If so, I do not know why Scripture wrote “his hand” [in the singular] in all other cases of the laying of hands. Perhaps it is for the purpose of deriving therefrom what the Rabbis have interpreted:<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 93b.</i> “<i>His hand</i> — and not the hand of his proxy.” For had it been written “his hands” [in the plural we would have interpreted it] to require the laying of both hands, and we would not have been able to exclude the proxy. But now that [we derive from other verses that] both hands must be laid upon the offering, [we must conclude that] He only wrote the singular [indicating the hands of only one person], to exclude a proxy, for although a man’s proxy is like the man himself<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 41b.</i> in all other places, we should not consider him so in the case of the laying of hands. In Torath Kohanim we find:<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 4:4.</i> “<i>And Aaron shall lay both his hands</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:21.</i> This teaches that the laying of hands upon the offering must be done with both hands, and forms the general rule for all cases of laying of hands, that they be done with both hands.”
AND IT SHALL BE FAVORABLY ACCEPTED FOR HIM TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIM. “For what kind of sins does [the freewill burnt-offering] effect atonement for the person that brings it? Should you say, for sins [where punishment if wilfully committed] is excision, or any of the [four] deaths imposed by the court, or death by the hands of Heaven, or stripes, the punishment for all these sins is already stated, [and atonement is affected by those punishments, and therefore not by this offering]! You must conclude that [the freewill burnt-offering] effects atonement only for transgression of a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah cites no punishment for failure to fulfill a positive commandment [with the two exceptions of not slaughtering the Passover-offering, and not being circumcised]. If a person thus failed to fulfill a positive commandment — such as dwelling in a booth on the Festival of Succoth — his bringing a freewill burnt-offering effects atonement for this sin.</i> and for the violation of a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">A case in point is the prohibition against taking an entire bird’s nest, with the mother-bird and its young (Deuteronomy 22:6). If, however, he did infringe upon the law, he is obliged to observe a positive commandment that the Torah stated next to the prohibition — <i>Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 7). Hence the usual punishment of stripes is not incurred for infringing the negative commandment, since the positive commandment “remedies” the prohibition. Yet it needs atonement, and the bringing of the burnt-offering expiates for it. — It is important to note that during the laying of hands on the offering the owner, in case of sin-offerings, confessed the sin for which he brought the offering, and so also in the case of guilt-offerings. Similarly, on bringing a burnt-offering he confessed the transgression for a positive commandment etc. [as explained here in the text]. In the case of the peace-offering, he uttered words of praise to G-d (Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Ma’asei Korbanoth</i> 3:14-15).</i> This is Rashi’s language, and it is a Beraitha<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Beraitha (literally: “outside”) is a teaching or tradition of the Tannaim that had been excluded from the Mishnah and incorporated in other collections. The Tosephta, Mechilta, Sifra (Torath Kohanim), and Sifre contain these Beraithoth.</i> in Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim <i>Vayikra</i> 4:5.</i><br>But I wonder! Where is “the punishment” for these sins already stated, since offerings only effect atonement for unwilful violations?<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">“Punishments” [such as “excision etc.”] are incurred only for <i>wilful</i> violation of the negative commandments, while offerings for atonement are brought only for <i>unwilful</i> violations. So how could Rashi state, “Should you say [that the freewill burnt-offering is brought] for such sins that make one liable to excision etc., the punishment for those sins has already been stated”? Where are those “punishments” for <i>unwilful</i> violations mentioned? For <i>unwilful</i> violations no punishments are ever incurred!</i> Now we could say that [the freewill burnt-offerings] atone for those unwilful sins which the penalty [if committed wilfully] is death by the hands of Heaven, or stripes, or any of the [four] deaths imposed by the court, in such cases that do not obligate one to bring a sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">The general rule is that a sin-offering is brought only for such a sin unwilfully committed for which the penalty if committed wilfully would be excision. Ramban is thus suggesting: we could say that the freewill burnt-offering atones for those unwilful sins for which the penalty is death by the hands of Heaven etc., and for all those sins for which the penalty is death by the court and yet do <i>not</i> require the bringing of a sin-offering for unwilful violation. Examples follow in the text.</i> such as smiting one’s father or mother, or cursing them,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The reason why the sin-offering is not brought for the unwilful violation of these negative commandments is that the punishment of excision is not incurred in case of the wilful violation thereof. See Note 68 above.</i> just as the sin-offering atones for the unwilful sins for which the penalty [if committed wilfully] is excision. But perhaps it appeared to the Sages that since Scripture expressly states the punishment for both the wilful and unwilful commission of sins punishable by death imposed by the hands of the court or by excision, [stating that if committed wilfully, the sinner is liable to one of the above punishments, and if committed unwilfully, he must bring a sin-offering], and it further set forth the punishment of those liable to death by the hands of Heaven or stripes for certain sins, if committed wilfully, but did not mention in these [last two categories] any punishment if the sins are committed unwilfully — therefore it appeared [to the Sages] that Scripture had completely set forth their case.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Scripture made it clear that in the case of those sins for which the penalty is death by the hands of Heaven or stripes if committed wilfully — no offering for expiation is needed when committed unintentionally. Rashi and the Torath Kohanim were thus correct in stating that the burnt-offering could not effect atonement for these unwilful sins, since “the punishments” have already been stated in Scripture both for wilful and unwilful sins, and therefore we could not say that the burnt-offering effects atonement for the above-mentioned sins if committed unwilfully.</i> For why should Scripture have explained the punishment of some sins if committed either wilfully or unwilfully, and explained the punishment for other sins [only] if committed wilfully, but not if committed unwilfully, and did not say that he is obligated to bring a burnt-offering? Therefore the Sages concluded that in the case of those sins for which one is liable to death by the hands of Heaven or stripes, they are only punishable if committed wilfully, as explained in Scripture, but if committed unwilfully there is no burden of sin at all and they do not need any atonement. This is the meaning of the saying of the Rabbis [in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim <i>Vayikra</i> 4:5.</i> mentioned by Rashi]: “their punishment has already been stated,” meaning that Scripture had already stated the whole punishment that G-d desired to impose on them. But for the wilful transgression of a positive commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah cites no punishment for failure to fulfill a positive commandment [with the two exceptions of not slaughtering the Passover-offering, and not being circumcised]. If a person thus failed to fulfill a positive commandment — such as dwelling in a booth on the Festival of Succoth — his bringing a freewill burnt-offering effects atonement for this sin.</i> and for the violation of a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">A case in point is the prohibition against taking an entire bird’s nest, with the mother-bird and its young (Deuteronomy 22:6). If, however, he did infringe upon the law, he is obliged to observe a positive commandment that the Torah stated next to the prohibition — <i>Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 7). Hence the usual punishment of stripes is not incurred for infringing the negative commandment, since the positive commandment “remedies” the prohibition. Yet it needs atonement, and the bringing of the burnt-offering expiates for it. — It is important to note that during the laying of hands on the offering the owner, in case of sin-offerings, confessed the sin for which he brought the offering, and so also in the case of guilt-offerings. Similarly, on bringing a burnt-offering he confessed the transgression for a positive commandment etc. [as explained here in the text]. In the case of the peace-offering, he uttered words of praise to G-d (Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Ma’asei Korbanoth</i> 3:14-15).</i> where Scripture mentioned no punishment whatever, and it is impossible that no penalty should be inflicted for them at all, in these cases the sinner is atoned for by this burnt-offering, if he brought it of his own freewill.<br>It is possible to say that because He did not use in the case of the freewill offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 5:18.</i> the expression: “to make atonement for him concerning the error which he committed,” as He said with reference to the offerings brought for sins committed unwilfully,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 5:18.</i> and instead He said, <i>and it shall be favorably accepted</i>, it appeared to our Rabbis that the meaning thereof is that [the burnt-offering] effects atonement for those who wilfully commit certain sins, seeing that these persons are not [hitherto] favorably accepted by Him. For he who commits a sin unwilfully is yet, in spite of his sin, considered favorably accepted by G-d. If so, it is impossible that the burnt-offering effect atonement for wilful sinners except for those who transgress a positive commandment or a negative commandment that is juxtaposed to a positive commandment, in which cases no punishment has been mentioned in Scripture, but they are not pleasing to G-d because they violated His commandment. With what can these men become favorably accepted by their Master?<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">See I Samuel 29:4.</i> With this gift!<br>I have seen in the Agadah,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The Agadah (homily) comprises all subjects in Rabbinical literature which do not aim directly at the exposition of the <i>laws</i> of the Torah, but which teach and edify on all subjects concerning the Torah. The Agadic literature is contained primarily in the Midrashim, as well as in the Talmud. It would appear that Ramban uses the term Agadah here in contradistinction to the Torath Kohanim previously mentioned, which is primarily a book of <i>Halachah</i> (law). There in the Torath Kohanim the purpose of the burnt-offering is as explained above; in the Agadah — in Vayikra Rabbah — it is assigned another purpose, as explained further on.</i> in Vayikra Rabbah:<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 7:3.</i> “Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai taught: The burnt-offering only comes to effect atonement for sinful thoughts of the heart. Said Rabbi Levi: It is a clear Biblical text: ‘<i>V’ha’olah al ruchachem</i>’<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew term for the burnt-offering is <i>olah</i> [literally, “comes up”]. There is thus here a suggestion that the <i>olah</i> is for those sinful thoughts “which come into one’s mind.”</i> (<i>And that which cometh into your mind</i>) <i>shall not be at all</i><sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 20:32.</i> — the <i>olah</i> (burnt-offering) effects atonement for those things which come into your mind. Similarly it says of Job: <i>and he offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, ‘It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed G-d in their hearts</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Job 1:5.</i> This proves that the burnt-offering only comes to effect atonement for sinful thoughts of the heart.” The reason why [the burnt-offering was singled out for this purpose] is because it is a sin that no one recognizes except G-d [Who knows our secret thoughts]; therefore it is wholly burnt to G-d.<br>The expression <i>v’nirtzah lo</i><sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Up to here we have followed Silberman’s translation of the phrase: “and it shall be favorably accepted for him.” Ramban now suggests three new interpretations: 1) “and he will be favorably accepted by Him.” 2) “and the sin will be completed to him” — never to be mentioned again. 3) “and it will be ‘agreeable’ to Him.”</i> refers back to <i>the Glorious Name</i> mentioned [in the preceding verse: <i>to the door of the Tent of Meeting he shall bring it for his acceptance before the Eternal</i>], meaning that he should be favorably accepted by Him through this offering which effects atonement for him. This is similar in expression to these verses: <i>for wherewith should this fellow ‘yithratzeh’</i> (<i>reconcile himself</i>) <i>unto his lord?;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 29:4.</i> <i>and the light of Thy countenance because ‘r’tzitham’</i> (<i>Thou wast favorable to them</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 44:4.</i> and many others. It is possible that <i>v’nirtzah</i> is a by-word for the sin, meaning that the sin is finished for him, so that he may now be forgiven, similar to these expressions: ‘<i>ki nirtzah avonah</i>’ (<i>that her guilt is paid off</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:2.</i> <i>until the land ‘rotz’thah’</i> (<i>had been paid</i>) <i>her Sabbaths</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">II Chronicles 36:21.</i> <i>and they ‘yirtzu’</i> (<i>shall be paid</i>) <i>the punishment of their iniquity</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:43.</i> — all these being expressions of completion. It is further possible to say in line with the first interpretation, that the sin will be as if it were “agreeable” [not objectionable before G-d], meaning that His anger will no longer be kindled against him.

Verse 5

AND HE SHALL SLAUGHTER THE BULL BEFORE THE ETERNAL. AND THE PRIESTS, AARON’S SONS, SHALL OFFER THE BLOOD. “All acts from receiving [the blood in a vessel] onwards are the duty of the priests. This teaches that the slaughtering [of the offering] is valid if performed by a <i>zar</i> (non-priest). <i>‘V’hikrivu’</i> (<i>and they shall offer</i> …) — this refers to ‘receiving’ [the blood], and the sense thereof is the bringing [of the blood to the altar]. Thus we learn that both of them [receiving the blood and bringing it to the altar], are to be done by Aaron’s sons.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But it is not correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban understood Rashi as saying that the word <i>v’hikrivu</i> has a primary meaning of “receiving” the blood in a vessel, which is the first process after the “slaughtering” mentioned immediately before in the verse, and a subsidiary meaning [from the root ‘<i>karav</i>’, to bring near] of “bringing” it to the altar. To this Ramban objects that ‘<i>v’hikrivu</i>’ is not derived from the root ‘<i>karav</i>’, implying bringing near, and hence cannot sustain the interpretation of “bringing it near” the altar even as a subsidiary meaning. Rather, it is associated with the word ‘<i>korban</i>’ (offering), and has only one meaning, that of “receiving” the blood, which is the first stage in offering. If so, whence do we know that bringing it near the altar may also be done only by priests [and is invalid if done by a non-priest]? To this Ramban replies that it is a logical deduction [“if receiving the blood may only be done by priests, it follows ‘all the more’ that bringing it to the altar, which is a later stage in its offering, has this requirement”]. A careful reading of Rashi and Ramban clearly indicates this interpretation.</i> Instead, the Midrash of our Rabbis states:<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 4:4.</i> “<i>V’hikrivu</i> — this is the receiving of the blood.” For the term <i>v’hikrivu</i> does not mean the bringing of the blood near to the altar, namely the <i>holachah</i> (carrying of it). Instead, <i>v’hikrivu</i> is an expression similar to the word <i>korban</i> (offering) and it signifies receiving [of the blood in a vessel] and sprinkling it upon the altar. Thus He mentioned bringing it [to the door of the Tent of Meeting], laying hands on it, and slaughtering it with reference to the owner of the offering, and after the slaughtering He immediately mentioned the sons of Aaron. It accordingly follows that receiving the blood is in itself a duty to be performed by the priests, and may only be done by a qualified priest and with vessels dedicated to the Temple Service; and [it follows] all the more that bringing it to the altar and sprinkling it [can be done only by a qualified priest]. Moreover, even carrying of the limbs to the ramp [leading to the altar] is invalid if done by a non-priest, for so the Rabbis interpreted:<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 4a.</i> “<i>And the priest shall offer it all, and cause it to ascend in fumes upon the altar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 13.</i> — this refers to carrying of the limbs to the ramp.” If so, carrying the blood to the altar also may be done only by a priest with all the conditions of priesthood.

Verse 6

AND HE SHALL FLAY THE BURNT-OFFERING. He is commanded to flay it while it is whole and afterwards he sever it. The expression <i>and he shall flay … and he shall sever</i> refers to the owner of the offering [even if he is a non-priest], just as He said, <i>and he shall lay his hand</i> …<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 4.</i> <i>and he shall slaughter</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> [which may also be done by a <i>zar</i> — a non-priest], for flaying and severing are not functions relating to the actual offering and are therefore valid if done by a <i>zar</i>. This is why [in the following verse] He says again, <i>And the sons of Aaron</i> [<i>the priest shall put fire upon the altar</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> Similarly, it is valid that the washing of the inwards be done by a <i>zar</i>. Hence He says, <i>But its inwards and its legs he shall wash in water</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9.</i> that is, the owner of the offering, and afterwards, <i>and the priest shall cause all to ascend in fumes</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9.</i> He states it in the plural, <i>and they shall put</i> …<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> <i>and they shall set the pieces</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> because all duties performed by the priests are commanded in this form, since there are many priests gathered in the House of G-d to attend to the burnt-offerings, and <i>in the multitude of the people is the King’s glory</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 14:28.</i> but it is not indispensable, since further on He taught, <i>and the priest shall set them in order</i><sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12.</i> [thus showing that even a single priest may perform all the acts].<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra, however, states that they must be performed by a minimum of two priests. This he bases upon the plural expression in Verse 7: <i>and they shall put fire</i>. It is thus clear that Ramban’s intention here is to exclude Ibn Ezra’s opinion, since it is not the accepted law.</i>
AND HE SHALL FLAY … AND HE SHALL SEVER … AND THE SONS OF AARON THE PRIEST SHALL PUT FIRE UPON THE ALTAR.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> This is not the correct order of these actions, for the right way is that the priests should first put fire upon the altar, and only then should they sever the limbs. Such indeed was the order of the arrangement of the Daily Offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 33.</i> Similarly, the verse stating, <i>And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall set the pieces, the head and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> and afterwards, <i>But its inwards and its legs he shall wash in water</i><sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9.</i> — does not mean to command that it be done in that order, for “the setting” [mentioned in Verse 8] refers to “the burning” of the pieces which He commanded further on [in Verse 9]: <i>and the priest shall cause all to ascend in fumes</i>. If so, the correct order of performance cannot be that he should bring up the pieces, and the head and the fat, and set them upon the fire that is upon the altar, and only afterwards should he wash the inwards and the legs and burn them! Rather, he first severed it and washed it, and then he brought everything up and set them on the fire to be burnt. The reason [for the order] of the verses is thus as follows: First He mentioned the sprinkling of the blood<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> in order to teach that this comes before everything else. Then He gave the commandment concerning the burning of the limbs, stating [in Verse 6 before us] that he should flay [the animal] and sever it in order to set the pieces upon the fire after washing the inwards and the legs, and then he should burn them all at one time, this being the sense of the expression <i>and the priest shall cause ‘all’ to ascend in fumes</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9.</i> The reason why Scripture repeated [the commandment] concerning the limbs, stating, <i>and they shall set them…upon the fire</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> <i>and the priest shall cause all to ascend in fumes</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9. — That is to say, in view of the fact that the expression <i>and they shall set the pieces in order …</i> [Verse 8] means the burning thereof, as explained above, the question appears why in Verse 9 it repeats the command concerning the limbs, <i>and they shall set them upon the fire?</i></i> is in order to teach us that after he arranges them upon the fire, he should not depart until the fire has taken hold of them and consumed them so that the fumes thereof ascend. Similarly, the reason why He preceded to mention the flaying and severing to that of making the fire, is in order to teach us that in a freewill burnt-offering [discussed in this section], there is no obligation to set the fire upon the altar before [these activities] as is the case with the Daily Offering, concerning which we were commanded, <i>and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 6:5.</i> this being the first thing of all that was done <i>in everything that pertaineth to the altar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:7. Actually the removal of the ashes from the altar (see further, 6:3) preceded the kindling of the wood. But Ramban’s intent here is obviously to <i>everything that pertaineth to the altar</i> as far as the burning of the offering is concerned.</i> as is explained in Tractate Yoma.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 33.</i>

Verse 7



Verse 8

V’ETH HAPADER.’ Onkelos translated it: <i>tarba</i> (fat), and this is also the concensus of opinion of all commentators, the word (<i>pader</i>) having no companion in the Hebrew language. In my opinion the word is not a generic term for all kinds of fat, but signifies specifically the thin layer of fat which spreads over and divides between the inwards, and the word <i>pader</i> is one of those terms whose letters are interchangeable, thus: <i>pader — pared</i> (division), [and is so called] since it divides between the upper and the lower inwards. That is why our Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 26a.</i> that [when the limbs are taken up to the altar] the <i>pader</i> is spread over the throat of the animal at the place where the act of slaughter was performed, for this is considered regard for Him Who is on high, since that fat is fit to be spread and serve as a cover. It is also customary among the nobility of nations to spread it over a roast. If, however, the word <i>pader</i> is indeed a generic term for all kinds of fat, [it is my opinion that] fat is so called because it is the greasy substance which is “separated” from the flesh, and such in fact is the term used as an equivalent for fat by students of nature, as I will mention.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 3:9.</i>

Verse 9

A BURNT-OFFERING. “[He shall burn it] with the intention that it should be a burnt-offering [and not an offering of another category]. ‘ISHEIH’ (A FIRE-OFFERING). When he slaughters it he should slaughter it with the intention of [burning it by] fire, [as will be explained further on]. Wherever the word <i>isheih</i> occurs, it is an expression of fire. PLEASING — it is pleasing to Me that I have commanded and My will was done.” This is the language of Rashi.<br>Now the Rabbi did not explain what is meant by “the intention of [burning it by] fire.” In the Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 46b.</i> the Rabbis have said: “this is to exclude <i>kabobo</i>, which may not be done.” Now the commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi <i>ibid</i>.</i> explained this to mean that he should slaughter it with the intention of placing it on flames burning the pile of wood upon the altar, and not of placing it upon dying coals which are in the process of being extinguished. To me it appears that the intention he needs to have is that the fire should burn it completely, and not that it should just be roasted there a little, the word <i>kabobo</i> being similar to the expression of the Rabbis in the chapter entitled “A stubborn and rebellious son: ”<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 70a.</i> “<i>k’basar kiba</i> (like partly-roasted meat) which thieves eat.” In Tractate Erubin we also find:<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Erubin 29b.</i> “<i>v’nichbeiv</i> (let him roast it) and eat it.” Now some books have a reading in Tractate Zebachim:<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 46b.</i> “this is to exclude <i>gabobo</i> (straw), which may not be done.” Accordingly the meaning thereof is that he should have the intention to put it on a fire of wood, as it is written, <i>on the wood that is on the fire</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12.</i> and he should not intend to put it upon a fire made of stubble and straw, similar to that which we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 36b.</i> “If a double-stove had been heated with stubble and <i>gabobo</i>.”<br>Now this verse mentions a reason for the offerings, namely, that they are <i>a fire-offering, of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</i>. The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed III, 46.</i> that the reason for the offerings is because the Egyptians and the Chaldeans in whose lands the children of Israel were strangers and sojourners, used always to worship the herd and the flock, the Egyptians worshipping the sheep and the Chaldeans worshipping the demons whom they imagined as assuming the form of goats. To this day men of India never slaughter the herd. It was for this reason that He commanded [Israel] to slaughter these three species [of cattle: the herd, the flock, and the goats], to the Revered Name, so that it be known that the very act which the idol-worshippers considered to be the utmost sin [i.e., slaughtering the above species], that same act should be done as an offering before the Creator, and through it Israel’s sins would be forgiven. For such is the way to cure people of false beliefs, which are the diseasees of the human soul, for all diseases and sicknesses are healed by medicines which are antithetical to them. These are the words [the Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon], and he expounded them at great length.<br>But these words are mere expressions, healing casually a severe wound<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">See Jeremiah 6:14.</i> and a great difficulty, and making <i>the table of the Eternal polluted</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 1:12.</i> [as if the offerings were intended only] to remove false beliefs from the hearts of the wicked and fools of the world, when Scripture says that they are <i>the food of the offering made by fire, for a pleasing odor</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 3:16.</i> Moreover, [if the offerings were meant to eliminate] the foolish [ideas] of the Egyptians, their disease would not thereby be cured. On the contrary, it would increase the cause of sorrow, for since the intention of the above-mentioned wicked ones was to worship the constellations of the sheep and the ox, which according to their opinion possess certain powers [over human affairs], and which is why they abstain from eating them in deference to their power and strength, then if these species are slaughtered to the Revered Name, it is a mark of respect and honor to [these constellations]. These worshippers themselves were in the habit of so doing, as He has said, <i>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:7.</i> and those who made the [golden] calf sacrificed to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 32:8. — In other words, despite the Torah commanding that these three animal species, [the herd, the flock, and the goats] should be offered up to G-d, idol-worshippers, who had other forms of deities, could still consider these offerings to be marks of honor to their own particular foolishness, as is evidenced by the fact that they used to sacrifice herd and flock to the goats, or to the calf! Thus how could the offerings specified in the Torah be a cure against all idols? This is the gist of Ramban’s argument. It is more readily understood in the light of Ramban’s explanation on the development of idolatry in Exodus Chapter 20, Verse 3, which indicates that the early idolators believed in a Supreme G-d. See also further, Note 117.</i> Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] mentions<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed III, 46.</i> that the idol-worshippers used to sacrifice to the moon on the days of new-moon, and to the sun when it rose in a particular constellation known to them from their books. The disease of idolatry would surely have been far better cured if we were to eat [these animal-deities] to our full, which would be considered by them forbidden and repugnant, and something they would never do!<br>Furthermore, when Noah came out of the ark with his three sons, there were as yet no Chaldeans or Egyptians in the world, yet he brought an offering, which was pleasing to G-d, as concerning it Scripture says, <i>And the Eternal smelled the pleasing odor</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 8:21.</i> and on account of it <i>He said in His heart, ‘I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake.’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 8:21.</i> <i>Abel likewise brought of the first-born of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Eternal had regard unto Abel and to his offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:4.</i> Yet there was as yet not the slightest trace at all of idol-worship in the world! Balaam said, ‘<i>I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 23:4.</i> His intent<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., G-d’s intent. In other words, the fact that Balaam who was not commanded by the laws of the Torah, brought offerings of the herd and the flock, shows that G-d’s intent in commanding Israel that the offerings be brought from the three animal species was not to cure people of these evil idolatrous beliefs, as Balaam was not commanded therein.</i> then was not to eradicate from [Balak’s mind] evil beliefs, nor was he commanded to bring the offerings. Instead, Balaam did so in order to approach G-d so that he would be reached by His communication. The Scriptural expression concerning the offerings is, <i>My food which is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, for a pleasing odor unto Me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:2.</i> Far be it that they should have no other purpose and intention except the elimination of idolatrous opinions from the minds of fools!<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">This concludes Ramban’s array of arguments against Rambam’s rationale of the offerings. It is important to point out that many great authors came to Rambam’s defense, as there are many Scriptural and Rabbinical sources which seem to confirm his opinion, and the questions Ramban raised have been answered by them. A summary of them will be found in my Hebrew commentary, pp. 11-12. See there also for the unique approach of Rabbi Meir Simcha in harmonizing the theories of both Rambam and Ramban.</i><br>It is far more fitting to accept the reason for the offerings which scholars<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Ibn Ezra. This is clearly apparent in Ramban’s language in his sermon called Torath Hashem Temimah, where he writes: “Now the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra on the matter of the offerings is that they are an atonement for the soul. The explanation of the matter on the basis of his opinion is that the offerings …” (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 164). It is thus clear that what follows is Ramban’s interpretation of the way he understood Ibn Ezra’s thought. This explains why the following exposition is not found verbatim in Ibn Ezra’s writings. See my Hebrew commentary (beginning with the third edition, p. 532).</i> say, namely that since man’s deeds are accomplished through thought, speech and action, therefore G-d commanded that when man sins and brings an offering, he should lay his hands upon it in contrast to the [evil] deed [committed]. He should confess his sin verbally in contrast to his [evil] speech, and he should burn the inwards and the kidneys [of the offering] in fire because they are the instruments of thought and desire in the human being. He should burn the legs [of the offering] since they correspond to the hands and feet of a person, which do all his work. He should sprinkle the blood upon the altar, which is analogous to the blood in his body. All these acts are performed in order that when they are done, a person should realize that he has sinned against his G-d with his body and his soul, and that “his” blood should really be spilled and “his” body burned, were it not for the loving-kindness of the Creator, Who took from him a substitute and a ransom, namely this offering, so that its blood should be in place of his blood, its life in place of his life, and that the chief limbs of the offering should be in place of the chief parts of his body. The portions [given from the sin-offering to the priests], are in order to support the teachers of the Torah, so that they pray on his behalf. The reason for the Daily public Offering is that it is impossible for the public [as a whole] to continually avoid sin. Now these are words which are worthy to be accepted, appealing to the heart as do words of Agadah.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The Agadah (homily) comprises all subjects in Rabbinical literature which do not aim directly at the exposition of the <i>laws</i> of the Torah, but which teach and edify on all subjects concerning the Torah. The Agadic literature is contained primarily in the Midrashim, as well as in the Talmud. It would appear that Ramban uses the term Agadah here in contradistinction to the Torath Kohanim previously mentioned, which is primarily a book of <i>Halachah</i> (law). There in the Torath Kohanim the purpose of the burnt-offering is as explained above; in the Agadah — in Vayikra Rabbah — it is assigned another purpose, as explained further on.</i><br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], there is a hidden secret contained in the offerings.

Hence if the name <i>Elokim</i> or <i>E-il</i> had been used in the section of the offerings it would have given an opportunity to the opponents [of the belief in the true Unity of G-d] that He is in need of food [i.e., in need of replenishing His powers]. Therefore only the Tetragrammaton is used in this whole section in order to indicate that His Existence is the only true Existence, and that everything exists only through His true Existence, for they are all in need of Him, but He is not in need of them nor of any of them.”</i> Perhaps you might say that He is in need of food, Scripture therefore says, <i>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 50:12.</i> I have only commanded you to bring the offerings in order that My Will should be said and fulfilled.” In the beginning of Torath Kohanim we also find:<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 2:5.</i> “Rabbi Yosei says: Wherever an offering is mentioned by Scripture, the Tetragrammaton is used, in order not to give an opportunity for heretics to rebel” [by finding pluralistic allusions against the principle of Unity]. These are the words of the Rabbis of blessed memory.<br>Now it is true that in the section of the Torah where the offerings are commanded it does not say <i>E-il</i> or <i>Elokim</i> (G-d).

In other words, although here in Verse 9 it is stated <i>isheih</i>, and so also in many other places, the word is yet to be understood as <i>isheh</i>, which is surely a noun and not an adjectival noun (as Ibn Ezra explained it).</i> The reason, however, why He did not say <i>eish</i> but said <i>isheih</i> [comprised of the letters: <i>alef, shin, hei</i>] is [to allude to] the plain meaning thereof, <i>as it hath been shown thee in the mount</i><sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 27:8. — See here my Hebrew commentary, p. 13.</i> at the Giving of the Torah, which refers to the offering in the attribute of justice. The slaughtering [of the offering] must be to the Name of the Eternal alone, meaning that [he who slaughters it] must have no intention to do so to anything else in the world, save unto the Name of the Eternal only, this being the meaning of the expression ‘<i>olah hu … isheh hu</i>’ (it is <i>a burnt-offering … a fire-offering</i>)…<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 8:21.

Verse 10

AND IF HIS OFFERING BE OF THE FLOCK. This section deals with the burnt-offering of the flock, and the law thereof is in every detail like that of the burnt-offering of the herd. That is why He shortened here the command, and did not mention “and he shall lay his hands” [upon the offering], nor “and it will be acceptable” [as mentioned above]. He said here in addition, however, that it be slaughtered <i>on the side of the altar, northward before the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> in order to explain that the expression <i>before the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 5, when speaking of the burnt-offering of the herd.</i> mentioned in connection with the bullock means the side of the altar northward. The meaning of <i>yerech</i> [<i>of the altar</i>] is “the side” of the altar, and in the northerly direction. The verse thus teaches that the ramp of the altar was on the south side, where the front of the altar was, concerning which it is said, <i>before the Eternal, in front of the altar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 6:7.</i> I have already explained the reason why the slaughtering was to be done on the north side.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 32:1.</i> Scripture states without specification, <i>round about the altar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.

Verse 14

OF TURTLEDOVES OR OF YOUNG PIGEONS. Scripture chose these two species [of birds] because they are accessible and can be more easily caught than other [birds], just as our Rabbis have mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 27:6.</i> with reference to <i>any of the sheep, and any of the goats</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14:4.</i> that [Scripture chose these species so that] a person should be able to bring an offering from those animals that feed at his crib, and should not have to take his weapons, quiver and bow, <i>to go out on the hunt to bring it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 27:5. See also <i>ibid.</i>, Verse 3.</i> He chose grown-up turtledoves<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Turtledoves may be offered only after their neck-feathers have turned bright yellow. Pigeons may be brought only when they are still so young that when their feathers are plucked blood is drawn (Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Isurei Mizbeiach</i> 3:2).</i> because they abstain [from pairing with strangers] and attach themselves only to their mates, and once they lose their companions they never associate with others. So Israel cleave to the Eternal their G-d,<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 4:4.</i> and never attach themselves to another deity, Pigeons, on the other hand, are very jealous and as a result of their jealousy they part [from their previous mates] and take on other mates. Therefore He chose them [as offerings] only when they are young, before their mating begins, for as long as the pigeon is young it is attached with greater love to the nest where it is reared than are all other fowls. Our Rabbis have mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1:5.</i> that if a person touches the nest of all other fowls to take therefrom the young ones or the eggs, they leave it and never nest therein again, but the pigeon never abandons it under any condition. And so is [the people of] Israel. They will never exchange their Creator and His Torah, but “either Jews or nailed to the stake.” He did not choose cocks [as offerings although they are readily accessible] because of their inclination to lewdness.<br>Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed III, 46.</i> that the reason for choosing grown-up turtledoves and young pigeons as offerings is that these are the best of their species, since old pigeons are less tasty. But this is not true, for young pigeons are almost inedible as a result of their excessive moistness. If, however, we are to take into consideration their natural tendencies as far as eating them is concerned, it is possible that they were chosen for their special qualities; for turtledoves have a propensity to sharpening of the mind, and young pigeons have a propensity to benefit greatly those who are not fully-matured physically, such as youths in the intermediate stage between boyhood and maturity, and the like.

Verse 15

AND THE PRIEST SHALL BRING IT UNTO THE ALTAR. This “bringing” means bringing it up onto the altar, signifying that the priest is to bring up the bird onto the altar and nip off its head there, as the nipping off may only be done on top of the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 65a.</i> It is for this reason that the Rabbis interpreted:<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 65a.</i> “<i>And the priest shall bring it</i> … Could you possibly think that a non-priest could come near the altar? If so, why does it say <i>the priest … shall nip off?</i> It is to teach us that the nipping off be done [not with an instrument but] only by the priest himself.” “<i>And he shall nip off … and cause it to ascend in fumes … and the blood thereof shall be wrung out</i>. Is it possible to say that after he has burnt it, he should squeeze the blood out? But [the order of the wording] is to teach us that just as the burning of the head is to be done separately [as is indicated here in the verse, <i>and he shall nip off its head, and cause it to ascend in fumes</i>], and that of the body is to be done separately [as is stated further on in Verse 17: <i>and he shall cleave it … and cause it to ascend in fumes</i>], so also the nipping off has to be done in this way, the head separately and the body separately. The plain meaning of the verse, however, is that the wording is to be inverted: and he shall nip off and cause it to ascend in fumes, and before the burning its blood shall have been wrung out.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>Now it is impossible to say [that the order of the verse can be explained to mean] that he should nip off its head and burn it, and afterwards wring the blood of the body on the wall of the altar and then burn the body, since no limbs of any offering may ever be burnt [on the altar] before the sprinkling of the blood, the principle <i>for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life</i><sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 17:11. Ramban’s intention is to defend Rashi’s explanation. At first sight, one could suggest an alternative explanation, which would leave the words of the verse in the correct order, namely that the nipping off and burning mentioned in the verse refer to the <i>head</i>, and the wringing of the blood can nonetheless be done <i>subsequently</i> because it refers to the body’s blood. Rashi, however, was compelled to invert the word-order because this suggested explanation is impossible, as explained by Ramban.</i> applying to all offerings. Therefore the Rabbis interpreted the verse [to mean] that Scripture intended only to liken the nipping off to the burning, so that in both cases the head should be treated by itself and the body by itself. The plain sense of the verse, however, is that “he should nip off its head in order to burn it on the altar,” thus teaching that the nipping off should be done in order to burn the head [separately, and not dispose of it otherwise], just as he will burn the body, concerning which He said, <i>and the priest shall cause it to ascend in fumes</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 17.</i> for such is Scriptures’ way of speaking about all offerings, as I have explained in connection with the severance into pieces of the burnt-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> However, Scripture states here, <i>and the priest shall cause it to ascend in fumes</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 17.</i> and did not say “and he shall cause <i>all</i> to ascend” [as it said above in Verse 9, in the case of the burnt-offering of the herd], because [here in the case of the burnt-offering of the fowl] the burning thereof was done in two separate stages: first he burnt the head, and then he removed the crop [from the body], and cleft it by the wings, and then he burnt the body, as we have been taught in Tractate Zebachim.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 65a.</i>

Verse 16

AND HE SHALL REMOVE ‘ETH MURATHO B’NOTZATHAH.’ “<i>Muratho</i> refers to the place of the digested food, namely ‘its crop.’ <i>B’notzathah</i> means ‘together with its entrails.’ The word <i>notzah</i> is a term for anything which is loathsome. Similarly: <i>for ‘natzu’</i> (<i>they are become loathsome</i>) <i>and are wandered away</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 4:15.</i> That is what Onkelos intended in translating ‘<i>b’notzathah’</i> as <i>b’uchleih</i> (with its digested food). This is also the interpretation of Aba Yosei ben Chanan who said<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 65a.</i> that he removes the stomach together with it [i.e., the crop]. But our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 65b.</i> he cuts out with a knife an opening around the crop like a flap, and removes it together with the feathers [on the skin].” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But it is not correct. For the word <i>notzah</i> in all places only means actual feathers. Similarly, <i>for ‘natzu’ and are wandered away</i><sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 4:15.</i> means that they have acquired feathers [wings] to fly away from their places and go into exile, and there too they will [constantly] wander, not finding a resting-place. Similarly: <i>for ‘natzoh’</i> (<i>she must fly away</i>) <i>and get away</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 48:9. Here too, the word <i>natzoh</i> is derived from the original root meaning “feathers” — hence: “she must fly away.”</i> The Jerusalem Targum rendered [the above-mentioned verse: <i>for ‘natzu’ and are wandered away</i>]:<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 4:15.</i> “for they are ‘quarrelsome’ and have also wandered away.” The Targum thus derived the word <i>natzu</i> from the expression, <i>when men ‘yinatzu’</i> (<i>strive</i>) <i>together</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 25:11.</i> and the verse is thus stating that “they strive with all the nations and wander away from them, and do not continue to live among them.” This is a correct interpretation. But the word <i>notzah</i> in the sense of “loathsome” as the Rabbi [Rashi] has it, is not found. The interpretation of Aba Yosei which made it incumbent upon the priest to take also the stomach with the crop, is [not because he considers the word <i>b’notzathah</i> to mean “the place of its entrails,” as Rashi understood him, but rather] because the crop and the gullet together with the stomach, comprising the organs for the digestion of food [in the bird], are all included in the term <i>muratho</i>, because in the stomach the food turns into <i>r’ie</i> (dung). Aba Yosei thus does not differ at all with the First Sage who says that he should take it with the “feathers,” for we have been taught in a Mishnah of the sixth chapter of Tractate Zebachim<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 64b.</i> [with reference to the order of the burnt-offering of the bird]: “He [i.e. the priest] came then to the body, and removed the crop and the feathers and the entrails that came forth with the crop, and cast them on the place of ashes.” This Mishnah is in accordance with the teaching of Aba Yosei<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">For according to the Sages he removes only the crop but not the entrails.</i> and yet it mentions “the feathers!”<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">This proves that Aba Yosei also interprets the word <i>b’notzathah</i> to mean with “its feathers,” and not, as Rashi explained it. that Aba Yosei interprets it to mean “the place of its digested food, namely the crop.”</i><br>Onkelos’ opinion [in translating <i>b’notzathah</i> as <i>b’uchleih</i>, is not because he considered this to be the Aramaic rendition of the word <i>b’notzathah</i>, so that you might think that he is of the opinion that the Hebrew word means “the place of its digested food,” as Rashi thought, but rather Onkelos’ opinion] is like that of the Sages, that he removed only the crop and its feathers together with the food therein which is the <i>mur’ah</i> [but he did not remove its entrails]. Since the priest takes hold of the crop and removes the food therein with it, therefore Onkelos rendered it: “and he shall remove <i>yath zfokeih b’uchleih</i>,” the expression being as if it had said: “and he shall remove <i>uchleih bizfokeih</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban is thus saying that Onkelos in translating the Hebrew phrase <i>muratho b’notzathah</i> as <i>yath zfokeih b’uchleih</i>, did not put it in the order of the wording of the Hebrew; instead, it is as if he had inverted it and rendered it <i>yath uchleih bizfokeih</i>, as the Aramaic <i>uchleih</i> is the equivalent of the Hebrew <i>muratho</i>, and the Aramaic <i>bizfokeih</i> is the equivalent of the Hebrew <i>b’notzathah</i>, as explained in the text. The reason for this change is, as explained by Ramban, because the food (<i>muratho</i>) is only removable by means of taking away the crop (<i>zfokeih</i>). Ramban then brings a number of proofs to illustrate that it is Onkelos’ habit to change the order of the Hebrew wording when it appears better to him to do so.</i> for <i>uchleih</i> [according to Onkelos] is the Aramaic for the Hebrew <i>muratho</i> [as <i>muratho</i> is associated with the word <i>r’ie</i> — “dung,” and “food” turns into dung], whereas <i>zfokeih</i> is the translation for the Hebrew <i>b’notzathah</i> [as will be explained]. The verse [according to Onkelos] thus means as follows: he should remove the <i>mur’ah</i>, which is the food, with the plumage upon it, meaning that he takes the crop with its skin and the feathers upon it. In a similar way Onkelos translated [the Hebrew <i>‘ki sh’mi b’kirbo’ — for My Name is in him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:21.</i>]: <i>arei bishmi meimreih</i> (“for in My Name is his word”),<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he speaks in My Name.</i> which, according to the Hebrew, he should have rendered into Aramaic as follows: <i>arei sh’mi b’meimreih</i> (for My Name is in his word). But Onkelos changed the order of the wording because of a certain reason known to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban <i>ibid.</i>, Verse 20 (towards the end — Vol. II, p. 413) where he explains Onkelos’ intent in that translation.</i> So also he translated the verse: <i>And the two ends of the two wreathen chains</i><sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:25.</i> — “and the two wreathen chains of the two ends.” There are many other such cases.

Verse 17

AND HE SHALL REND IT ‘BICHNAFAV’ — “together with its feathers. He need not pluck out the feathers of its plumage. <i>Knafav</i> means the actual feathers [not the wings].” This is the language of Rashi. But it is not correct, for if so, then Scripture does not mention from which place he is to rend [the bird], whether from its front or back. Rather, the meaning thereof is as follows: “he shall rend it at the place of its wings,” for the letter <i>beth</i> [in the word <i>bichnafav</i>] serves here as “the <i>beth</i> of apparatus,” [teaching that the rending is to be done from the back of the bird where “the wings” are, for <i>knafav</i>, as will be explained, means “its wings,” and not “its feathers” as Rashi explained]; similar to the expression, <i>ba’aron</i>, (in the ark), <i>ba’bayith</i>, (in the house), or <i>ba’sadeh</i> (in the field). <i>Knafav</i> does not mean “feathers” [as Rashi wrote], but is similar to all expressions of <i>knafayim</i> mentioned in Scripture [which mean wings]: <i>every bird, whatever hath ‘kanaf’</i> (<i>wings</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 7:14.</i> <i>and he stretcheth ‘knafav’</i> (<i>his wings</i>) <i>towards the south</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Job 39:26.</i> Similarly, <i>‘bichnaf’</i> (<i>the skirt</i>) <i>of his robe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 15:27. Literally: “the wing” of his skirt.</i> <i>Notzah</i> is the down [the soft under-plumage] on the body of birds, something like that which is written, <i>a great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of ‘hanotzah’</i> (<i>down</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 17:3.</i> Similarly we have learned [in the Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Taharoth 1:3.</i> “Large feathers and down are both capable of contracting uncleanness and conveying uncleanness, and join together [with the flesh to make up the required size that is needed to convey uncleanness].” The Rabbis have also said:<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, <i>Acharei</i> 12:2.</i> “excepting the beak and claws, the large feathers and the down.”

Chapter 2



Verse 1

AND HE SHALL POUR OIL UPON IT AND PUT FRANKINCENSE THEREON. 2. AND HE SHALL BRING IT TO AARON’S SONS. “This teaches that the pouring of the oil and the mingling of it together with the flour [of the meal-offering] is valid if done by a non-priest. TO AARON’S SONS THE PRIESTS; AND HE SHALL TAKE OUT HIS HANDFUL. From the taking of the handful [for the altar] and onwards is the duty of the priests.” This is the language of Rashi. Now we have to explain that the duty of the priests does not begin with the taking of the handful, for bringing the meal-offering near [to the altar] precedes the taking of the handful, and that too is invalid when done by a non-priest, as He said, <i>and he shall present it unto the priest, and he shall bring it nigh unto the altar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 8.</i> and afterwards it says, <i>and the priest shall remove from the meal-offering the memorial-part thereof</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9.</i> which is the handful. Thus you see that it is the priest who brings the meal-offering near the altar, to the south-west corner thereof,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban further, 6:7.</i> and after that he removes the handful [to be burnt on the altar]. So also we have learned [in the Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 36a.</i> “The acts of laying hands upon the offering, the wavings,<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">These laws applied to certain animal offerings as well as certain meal-offerings. See Menachoth 61a.</i> bringing [the meal-offering] near [to the altar], and removing the handful are performed by men and not by women.” In explanation thereof the Rabbis said [there in the Gemara]:<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 36a.</i> “bringing near [can be performed only by men] because it is written, <i>And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall bring it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 6:7.</i> — <i>the sons of Aaron</i> but not the daughters of Aaron.” This being the case, the bringing near [of the meal-offering to the altar] is the duty of the sons of Aaron. But the intention of the Sages in saying: “From the taking of the handful and onwards is the duty of the priests” [as quoted by Rashi above], is to say that from this taking of the handful mentioned in this verse and onwards, is the duty of the priests, but not these things which Scripture mentioned here as preceding the taking of the handful, since He mentioned already in this section pouring the oil [and mingling it with the flour], putting the frankincense thereon and bringing it to the priest, and [the priest’s] removing the handful. However, bringing it near to the altar is not mentioned here, [but is stated further on in <i>Seder Tzav</i> 6:7] that all those things stated here before the taking of the handful — namely, pouring the oil and mingling it with the flour, and bringing it to the priest — are valid if done by a non-priest.

NO MEAL-OFFERING, WHICH YE SHALL BRING UNTO THE ETERNAL, SHALL BE MADE WITH LEAVEN. Here He prohibited the bringing of a meal-offering in leaven form. After that He said, <i>Ye shall not ‘thaktiru’</i> (<i>cause to ascend in fumes</i>) <i>either any leaven or honey</i>, in order to prohibit the leavening of the handful and burning it upon the altar, this being included in the expression <i>ye shall not cause to ascend in fumes</i> … All terms of <i>haktarah</i> are expressions of burning aromatics, for druggists say<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 12:4.</i> that honey would have been appropriate for the incense,<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">This explains why the Torah uses here the term <i>thaktiru</i>.

Similarly, one is liable to the punishment of stripes for mixing [leaven or honey with the handful in such a way that it is not recognized], because Scripture included it in saying, <i>for ye shall not cause to ascend in fumes ‘any’ leaven or ‘any’ honey</i>, as is explained in Tractate Menachoth<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 58a.</i> and in Tractate Pesachim.<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Pesachim 43b.</i><br>The reason why Scripture mentions here <i>minchah hi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6. — Actually the word is written <i>hu</i> [<i>hei-vav-alef</i>, which is the masculine third person pronoun], but it is read <i>hi</i> [<i>hei-yod-alef</i>, which is the equivalent feminine pronoun].

Our Rabbis have similarly said with reference to monuments [of one stone raised in order to sacrifice on it], that this was a favored mode of worship in the days of the patriarchs,<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 28:18.</i> and afterwards G-d hated it<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:22.</i> because [the Canaanites] had made it an ordinance of an idolatrous character, as He said, <i>which the Eternal thy G-d hatheth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:22.</i><br>Concerning the reason why we were commanded to offer salt with every offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> [Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] also said<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed, III, 46.</i> that it is because the idolaters rejected it and did not offer it at all to their idols; [therefore He commanded us to have salt in every offering]. It is possible that [we are commanded to offer salt because] it is not respectful that the food which is offered up to G-d should have no flavoring, being without salt,<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Job 6:6: <i>Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt?</i></i> similar to that which is written, <i>Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 1:8. — “The Torah thus teaches us a rule of conduct — that Royal Majesty of heaven is similar to that on earth” (Bachya, in my edition Vol. II, p. 406).</i> That is why the Sages excluded wood and blood<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 21a.</i> from the requirement of being offered with salt [since they are not edible]. Or it may be that there is in all these matters some secret hidden from us.<br>In the case of leaven and honey Scripture speaks in the plural [<i>for ‘ye’ shall not cause to ascend in fumes, either any leaven or honey</i>] because it speaks to Aaron and his sons.

Verse 12



Verse 13

NEITHER SHALT THOU SUFFER THE SALT OF THE COVENANT OF THY G-D TO BE LACKING FROM THY MEAL-OFFERING. “For a covenant was established with salt as far back as the six days of Creation, for the lower waters [i.e., those of the oceans] were promised that they would be offered upon the altar in the form of salt, and [also as water] at the libation of water, on the Festival of Tabernacles.”<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">During the morning Daily Whole-offering on the seven days of the Festival of Succoth, there was in addition to the regular libation of wine, a libation of water on the altar. The drawing of the water from the fountain of Shiloah was marked by a great public festivity held in the Court of the Sanctuary during the evenings of the festival. They were known as the <i>Simchath Beth Ha’sho’evah</i> (Rejoicing of the Drawing of the Water).</i> This is Rashi’s language, and it is a homiletic exposition of the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:19. See Rabbi M. Kasher’s Torah Shleimah here, Note 111.</i> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted it in line with the plain meaning of Scripture as follows: “I have brought you into a covenant and made you swear that you would not offer a saltless offering, nor shall it [i.e., a saltless offering] be eaten,<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra’s intention in using this phrase [“Nor shall it be eaten”] is unclear to me. Perhaps he means that the priests when eating the flesh of certain offerings [such as the sin-offering, guilt-offering etc., or the Israelite eating the peace-offering] must salt it, otherwise the food is without flavor and thus they show their contempt for it, as they did not take the effort to prepare it properly. The commentators on Ibn Ezra are silent on this point.</i> because it is a mark of contempt.” Now since salt is the covenant of the offerings, Scripture made this accord the pattern for all such agreements, saying of the gifts given to priests and the dynasty of David that they are [an everlasting] <i>covenant of salt</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:19 [referring to the gifts of the priests]; II Chronicles 13:5 [referring to the kingdom of the House of David].</i> meaning that they are as everlasting as the covenant of salt of the offerings. There, however, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained:<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:19.</i> “<i>A covenant of salt</i> — a covenant decreed, it being of the root, <i>a fruitful land into a salt waste</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 107:34.</i> since a salt waste is as if it has been decreed [upon it that nothing should grow therein].”<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">So clearly explained in Ibn Ezra (Numbers 18:19).</i> But there is no sense to his words.<br>Now it seems to me that since Scripture here states, <i>the covenant of thy G-d</i>, and does not say “the covenant of the Eternal,” which would have been in consonance with the language of the section and the way all the offerings are mentioned [throughout Scripture], or did not say, “the covenant of the Eternal thy G-d” — that the reason for this is because salt is derived from water, and it is through the power of the sun which shines upon it that it becomes salt. Now the nature of water is that it soaks into the earth and makes it bring forth and bud; but after it becomes salt it destroys every place and burns it, <i>that it is not sown, nor beareth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 29:22.</i> Since a covenant is inclusive of all attributes, water and fire come into it, and <i>unto</i> her <i>shall come the former dominion</i><sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">Micah 4:8.</i> — the Kingdom of G-d, just like salt which seasons all foods and helps to preserve them, but destroys them when they are over-saturated with it. Thus salt is like the covenant. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <i>Ought ye not to know that the Eternal, the G-d of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt</i><sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">II Chronicles 13:5.</i> forever? For this too is the attribute of David. Therefore He says in connection with the offerings, <i>it is an everlasting covenant of salt</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:19.</i> for the covenant is “the salt of the world,” and by virtue of it [the world] exists or may be destroyed. I have already taught you to understand from our words in other places the meaning of these three words, <i>brith olam hi</i> (<i>it is a perpetual covenant</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 31:16-17, and Ramban there at the end of Verse 13 (Vol. II, p. 548).</i>

Verse 14

V’IM (AND IF) THOU BRING A MEAL-OFFERING OF FIRST-FRUITS. “The word <i>im</i> (if) here has the meaning of <i>ki</i> (when), for the bringing [of this meal-offering of the first-fruits] is not a voluntary matter, since Scripture speaks here of the meal-offering of the new barley, which is obligatory.<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">Further 23:10. It was brought on the sixteenth day of Nisan — the second day of Passover. It is known as the Omer. For a full discussion see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 54-55.</i> Similarly, ‘<i>V’im’</i> (<i>and if</i>) <i>the Jubilee of the children of Israel shall be</i><sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 36:4.</i> [means ‘when’ the Jubilee will be — for it is bound to come].” This is Rashi’s language.<br>The correct interpretation is that He used the expression <i>im</i> (if) because He is not commanding the performance now of this precept [namely bringing the meal-offering of the new barley], and He is thus saying: “When you offer a meal-offering baked on the griddle<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> you shall do it in such-and-such a way; and if you offer a meal-offering of the stewing-pan,<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> you shall make it in another way; and if the meal-offering you will bring will be the one of first-fruits, you should do it in this manner.” Thus the word <i>im</i> is here to be understood in its literal sense [namely, “if”]. Then the meaning of the verse, ‘<i>V’im’the Jubilee of the children of Israel shall be</i><sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 36:4.</i> is as follows: [The heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribe of Manasseh] said to Moses: “Even ‘if’ the children of Israel will inherit the Land forever, and will be privileged to sanctify the year of the Jubilee, the inheritance [of Zelophchad] will not return to us” [because his daughters might marry men from other tribes, which would cause the land to be transferred to other tribes].<br>It is also possible that He is stating: “And if you bring a meal-offering of the first-fruits, you shall do it in this prescribed way,” as if He were to say, “if the Eternal your G-d will bring you into the Land, and you will reap the harvest thereof and bring the meal-offering of the first-fruits, you shall do it in such-and-such a manner;” for G-d always mentions the inheritance of the Land to them conditionally, just as He said, <i>For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment … then will the Eternal drive out all these nations from before you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 11:22-23.</i> and so also in many places.

This applies only to the sin-offering of an ordinary individual.

Verse 9

CHELBO’ (THE FAT THEREOF) ‘HA’ALYAH TH’MIMAH’ (THE FAT TAIL ENTIRE). The term <i>cheilev</i> (fat) in the Sacred Language indicates that part of the fat which is separate from the meat and not joined to it. <i>Shuman</i>, on the other hand, is that fat which is intertwined with the meat and cannot be separated from it, something like that which Scripture states: ‘<i>Vayishman Yeshurun</i>’ (<i>But Jeshurun waxed fat</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:15.</i> <i>so they did eat, and were filled ‘vayashminu’</i> (<i>and became fat</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 9:25.</i> ‘<i>hashmein</i>’ (<i>make fat</i>) <i>the heart of this people;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:10.</i> <i>and my flesh is lean ‘mishamen’</i> (<i>and hath no fatness</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 109:24.</i> <i>and it shall be rich ‘v’shamein’</i> (<i>and fat</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 30:23.</i> <i>my soul is satisfied as with marrow ‘vadeshen’</i> (<i>and fatness</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 63:6. It should be noted that this verse does not contain the root <i>shuman</i>, but <i>deshen</i>. We must assume then that Ramban considered them equivalent terms. This is strengthened by an examination of the Hebrew wording of the verse: ‘<i>k’mo cheilev vadeshen tisba nafshi</i>.’ Now <i>deshen</i> is thus in parallelism to <i>cheilev</i>; hence <i>deshen</i> must here be understood as <i>shuman</i>, as explained above.</i> and similarly in all places. But <i>cheilev</i> is the fat which is separate from the meat and covered by a membrane, and is easily peeled off. The Hebrew language never interchanges these terms [<i>cheilev</i> and <i>shuman</i>] in any place. Thus we say, <i>basar shamen</i> (fat meat), but not <i>basar cheilev</i> [since <i>cheilev</i>, as explained, is the fat which is separate and distinguished from the meat]. Similarly in languages of other nations these terms are separate. The term <i>cheilev</i> is sometimes used metaphorically, as is written, <i>when ye set apart ‘chelbo’</i> (<i>the best thereof</i>) <i>from it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:30.</i> since the good part of the produce which is taken up [to be given to the priest], Scripture figuratively calls <i>cheilev</i>, just as the <i>cheilev</i> is set apart in the offerings. ‘<i>Cheilev kilyoth</i>’ (<i>the kidney-fat</i>) <i>of wheat</i><sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:14.</i> — Scripture here compares wheat to the kidneys and the fat therein, just as it states, <i>and of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:14.</i> although wine is not blood [hence we must conclude that Scripture only uses these terms figuratively]. <i>And ye shall eat the ‘cheilev’</i> (<i>fat</i>) <i>of the land</i><sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 45:18.</i> means that they shall eat the best of the bullocks, sheep, and goats and all animals. Such is the usage of this figure of speech.<br>Now the tail does not contain any <i>cheilev</i> at all,<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Having established the premise that the term <i>cheilev</i> has a figurative meaning, Ramban now proceeds to his main theme here: that the tail of the animal contains no <i>cheilev</i> [which is the term for the fat which is forbidden to be eaten] at all, but rather it contains <i>shuman</i> [which is the fatty substance contained in the meat which cannot be separated from it, and is permitted to be eaten]. At the end of this lengthy discussion it will be made clear that Ramban’s intention is to refute a major contention of the Karaites, who prohibited the eating of the fat of the tail, while the true tradition of the Rabbis permits it to be eaten. See further, Note 277.</i> but rather has in it <i>shuman</i> (fat) which is not separate from the meat thereof, just as there is <i>in every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 24:4.</i> This is confirmed by doctors who in their studies of nature have established the fact that <i>cheilev</i> [fat which is separate from the meat], is never to be found [in the animal] near the hide, nor in a limb which is always in movement [such as the tail]. The doctors have further said that the nature of <i>shuman</i> found in the ribs, sides and tail, which is not separate from the meat, is warm and moist, whilst that fat which can be separated from the meat, such as that which is upon the kidneys, is cold and moist, thick and coarse; it is difficult for the stomach to digest it fully, and it easily spoils; it also increases the white fluid<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">The ancients believed that a person’s physical and mental constitution is determined by the proper balance of the four bodily fluids which exist in every man. These are “the four humors” — the red, the white, the green, and the black — which vary constantly in man and determine his state of health and disposition at any given moment. Since the eating of <i>cheilev</i> increases the white fluid beyond the proper proportion, it affects the health of the person adversely.</i> and constipates.<br>If so, the verse stating, <i>Eat ye not any ‘cheilev’</i> (<i>fat</i>) <i>nor blood</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 17.</i> does not include the <i>shuman</i> (fat) which is upon the tail, for that is not <i>cheilev</i> by name or nature. If all fat were to come under the term <i>cheilev</i>, then all fat in an animal — on the shoulders and sides — would not be allowed to be eaten! For Scripture does not say: “All fat which is offered unto G-d ye shall not eat” [so that you would include in this prohibition the fat of the tail, since it is offered as a fire-offering on the altar]. Rather, He states that “the <i>cheilev</i> (fat) of all cattle which are brought as offerings upon the altar, must not be eaten.”<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intent is to refer to the following verse: <i>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering unto the Eternal, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people</i> (further, 7:25). Now the verse does not state “For whosoever eateth the fat which men present as an offering …” [so that you could argue, since the tail and the fat thereon are offered upon the altar, therefore they may not be eaten]. Rather, the verse states, <i>For whosoever eateth the fat ‘of the beast’ of which men present an offering</i> …, thus teaching that the <i>cheilev</i> of any animal which <i>can be</i> brought as an offering — whether it is actually brought as a hallowed offering or is eaten as common food — is forbidden to be eaten. Thus the verse establishes that <i>cheilev</i> of the ox, sheep, and goat [from which offerings can be brought] is forbidden to be eaten, whether it be an offering or common food. See further, Note 277.</i> It is indeed impossible to say that He prohibited all these fats of the animal which are offered on the altar, for if so the kidneys and the lobe above the liver would be forbidden to be eaten [since they are offered on the altar]!<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Verses: 4 and 10, etc. And yet even the Karaites do not forbid these foods!</i> Rather, whatever fat comes under the term <i>cheilev</i> [as explained above], is forbidden to be eaten, even though it is not brought on the altar, such as the fat on the spleen; and that which is not called <i>cheilev</i> may be eaten even though it is offered on the altar, such as the [fat of the] kidneys and the lobe above the liver, and similarly also that of the tail [which even though it is brought on the altar, may be eaten because it is <i>shuman</i> and not <i>cheilev</i>]. Similarly, Scripture states in connection with the command of the installation of the priests, <i>And thou shalt take of the ram ‘ha’cheilev’</i> (<i>the fat</i>) <i>and the tail;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:22. This shows that the fat of the tail is not called <i>cheilev</i>.</i> and at the performance thereof it is written, <i>And he took the fat, and the tail</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 8:25.</i> for the tail is not <i>cheilev</i>. Now this verse [before us] which states ‘<i>chelbo ha’alyah th’mimah</i>’, means that he shall offer up [from the peace-offerings] the fat thereof, together with the entire fat tail, meaning that when he removes the “entire fat tail” until the rump-bone, he must take with it much fat that is attached to it on the inside. Thus the Rabbis have said in Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra</i> 19:2.</i> “This tells us that he must also take the fat near the tail, which is the fat between the sinews [in the loins].”<br>In my opinion the purport of this verse is also like that of the other verse: <i>And he shall offer of it all ‘chelbo’</i> (<i>the fat thereof</i>)<i>: ‘ha’alyah’</i> (<i>the fat tail</i>), <i>and the fat that covereth the inwards</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 7:3.</i> So here likewise He says, <i>And He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings</i> all the fat thereof. In these two verses [just quoted], He first makes a general statement, that [the priest] should offer all the fat thereof, and then He mentions in detail all the parts that he should offer [namely, <i>the fat tail entire … and the fat that covereth the inwards … and the two kidneys, and the fat upon them … and the lobe above the liver</i> …]. Now not everything that is mentioned here is <i>cheilev</i> [fat forbidden to be eaten], for the two kidneys [themselves] and the lobe above the liver are not at all included in the term <i>cheilev</i>. Thus He stated in the section of <i>Bayom Ha’shemini:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">“On the Eighth Day” of Initiation. It is the third section in this Book of Vayikra, known as <i>Shemini</i>.</i> <i>And ‘ha’cheilev’</i> (<i>the fat</i>), <i>and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 9:10. The use of the separate terms there thus clearly proves that not everything mentioned is <i>cheilev;</i> hence we may also say that the <i>alyah</i> mentioned is not <i>cheilev</i>.</i> mentioning the <i>cheilev</i> by itself and then the other inwards by themselves, even as He said, <i>And thou shalt take of the ram ‘ha’cheilev’ and the tail</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:22. This shows that the fat of the tail is not called <i>cheilev</i>.</i> If so, the reason why the tail is offered [on the altar] is not because it is included here in Verse 9] in the term <i>chelbo</i>. Rather, He states here that the priest should burn [on the altar] from the peace-offerings all the fat thereof, and then He proceeds to explain all the inwards [which he should offer], some being <i>cheilev</i> and some not. The meaning of the verse in the case of the sin-offering stating, <i>And all the fat thereof he shall take away, as ‘cheilev’</i> (<i>the fat</i>) <i>is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:31.</i> is not to refer only to that which is strictly speaking <i>cheilev</i>, for if that were so, the kidneys and the lobe on the liver [which are not <i>cheilev</i>] would not be offered up in the case of the sin-offering. Rather, the intention of the verse is that he is to take away the <i>cheilev</i> together with all the things that are removed from the peace-offerings. Similarly, [the verse stating in the case of the she-lamb brought as a sin-offering], <i>And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 35.</i> means that he is to take away as he had done in the case of the peace-offerings, meaning everything that he had taken away there, including the tail with its fat. Similarly, <i>And they put the ‘chalavim’</i> (<i>fats</i>) <i>upon the breasts, and he caused the fats to ascend in fumes</i><sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:20.</i> means [the <i>cheilev</i>] together with all that is removed from them.<br>I have had to discuss this point at length in order to shut up the mouths of the Sadducees,<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">So also in Ibn Ezra here. The “Sadducees,” strictly speaking, were a sect during the Second Temple that denied the authority of the oral tradition. The name Sadducee, however, became a synonym for all those who denied Talmudic authority. The reference here is definitely to the Karaites — a sect which appeared in the Gaonic period (760 Common Era) which rejected the authority of the Oral Law, and based itself on individual interpretation of the Torah. A major contention of theirs (based upon the present verse) was that the tail is forbidden to be eaten since it is here called <i>cheilev</i>. See also Maimonides who writes: “the heretics who here in the Orient are called Karaites” (“The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 160).</i> may their name be erased [from memory], for in matters of Torah it has been said, <i>Answer a fool according to his folly</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 26:5. Ramban’s allusion [in his words “for in matters of Torah it has been said, <i>Answer</i> … “] is to a point the Sages have made regarding an obvious contradiction in the Book of Proverbs. In Verse 4 there it states, <i>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him</i>, and immediately in the following verse it states, <i>Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes</i>. The Sages explained that there is no contradiction: “in matters of Torah answer him, but in other matters do not” (Shabbath 30b). It is to this principle that Ramban alludes in writing, “for in matters of Torah it has been said … ”</i> and the Rabbis have also said,<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 2:14.</i> “Be diligent in learning Torah, in order to<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">“In order to.” In our standards text of the Mishnah: “and know what to.”</i> be able to answer the unbeliever.”<br>The Gaon Rav Saadia<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">See in Exodus, Vol. II, p. 99, Note 230.</i> explained it to them,<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Karaites. “Saadia persisted in fighting Karaism with literary weapons; and throughout his checkered life he continued to combat its apostles with unrelenting vigor, so that he became the most dreaded and most hated opponent of the [Karaite] sect down to our own times” (H. Malter, “Saadia Gaon,” p. 262).</i> by saying that <i>chelbo ha’alyah</i> is missing a connective <i>vav</i>, which would make it: <i>chelbo veha’alyah</i> — (its fat “and” the tail) [thus clearly meaning that the tail is not included in the <i>cheilev</i>]. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra refuted Rav Saadia Gaon by saying [that “from a grammatical point of view this could not be possible, for if so] it should have said <i>chelbo elyato</i><sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, since <i>chelbo</i> comes with the pronominal suffix [meaning “its fat”], the word <i>ha’alyah</i> (the tail) should likewise have come in that form: <i>elyato</i> (“its tail”).</i> or <i>hacheilev ha’alyah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Or since <i>v’ha’alyah</i> (according to Saadia Gaon’s interpretation) comes without the pronominal suffix, the word <i>chelbo</i> should also not have it, making it — <i>hacheilev v’ha’alyah</i>. Thus Ibn Ezra is saying that the Karaite interpretation still stands, for since it is written <i>chelbo ha’alyah</i> it would appear that <i>ha’alyah</i> is in apposition to <i>chelbo</i>, thus explaining: “What is <i>chelbo? Ha’alyah</i>.” — Ramban, however, will refute this argument of Ibn Ezra, bringing proof from another verse in Scripture which mentions two nouns together, and yet one is written with a pronominal suffix and the other without. Thus Saadia Gaon’s refutation of the Karaite interpretation is valid, and the tradition that the tail is not <i>cheilev</i> is confirmed. See, however, further in text where Ramban comments on the Gaon’s interpretation.</i> But Ibn Ezra’s refutation is not valid, for we find [Scripture stating], <i>And all Israel and their elders, and officers, and their judges</i>!<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 8:33. Here <i>u’zkeinav</i> (and their elders) comes with a pronominal suffix, and <i>v’shotrim</i> (and officers) does not. In our case too it is therefore correct to say, as Saadia Gaon does, that <i>chelbo ha’alyah</i> means <i>chelbo v’ha’alyah</i>, and the two nouns do not stand in apposition to each other, thus proving that the <i>alyah</i> is not <i>cheilev</i>.</i> I will yet mention<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 7:25.</i> a great mistake which Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra made in his arguments with them [i.e., the Karaites], in which he spoke more wrongly than they.<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intent is to Ibn Ezra’s statement there that <i>cheilev</i> of a cattle slaughtered as common food is not forbidden to be eaten (see above Note 266). That opinion is more harmful than what the Karaite have said. For in abstaining from eating the fat of the tail no infringement of the Torah is incurred, whilst in eating of the <i>cheilev</i> of cattle slaughtered as common food, one violates a prohibition of the Torah!</i> However, the Gaon’s interpretation is not correct,<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, Ibn Ezra’s argument against the Gaon’s interpretation is surely not valid, as explained above. Yet the Gaon’s interpretation is also not persuasive, since his explanation is dependent upon a missing connective <i>vav</i>, making the word <i>ha’alyah — v’ha’alyah</i> (“and” the tail). Such an interpretation is not sufficiently convincing to base thereon the permission to eat the tail.</i> and surely it is not an argument sufficiently persuasive to permit the eating [of the tail because of it]. But the interpretation which our Rabbis advanced<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 117a.</i> on the verse, <i>Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 7:23.</i> that He prohibited only [that kind of fat like] the fat of the ox which is common to all [i.e., the sheep and the goat, thus excepting the fat of the tail of the sheep, which is not found in the ox], that is a proper interpretation [from which we may clearly know that the tail is permitted to be eaten]! But in order not to give contestants an occasion to dispute [the tradition of the Rabbis], we have had to bring the [other] proofs and arguments which we have written.

Verse 12

AND IF HIS OFFERING BE A GOAT. He mentions here the species, thus meaning, “if of the species of goats is his offering,” [and thus includes male and female]. This is like the opinion of Onkelos who translated: “and if of the ‘<i>bnei</i>’ (species of) the goats is his offering.” Similarly, that which He said in connection with the burnt-offering, <i>whether of the sheep, or of the goats</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:10.</i> also means of their species [for since the male of the goats is called <i>tayish</i>, the verse there which speaks of a burnt-offering which can be only a male, must perforce mean “the species of the goats,” which automatically includes the males].<br>In my opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote">The above was the interpretation of Ibn Ezra. Hence Ramban now states, “in my opinion … ”</i> the Sacred Language is not particular as to the names of animals, for the majority of them have the same name for both male and female, such as camel, ass, rock-badger, hare, and swine, and among the birds the young pigeon and the turtle-dove. Even among the species which do have different names for the male and female — such as <i>shor</i> and <i>parah</i> (ox and cow), <i>kesev, kisbah</i> (he-lamb, ewe-lamb), <i>tayish</i> and <i>eiz</i> (he-goat and she-goat) — Scripture is not particular, and will sometimes say <i>seh</i> and <i>shor</i> of the female, similar to that which is written, ‘<i>V’shor o seh</i>’ [literally: “and ox or lamb] <i>ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 22:28.</i> which applies only to the dam and the lamb [it being permissible to slaughter the male parent and its young in one day], in accordance with the opinion of the Sage who says<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 78b. The name of the Sage is Rabbi Yehudah.</i> that [in animals] one does not take into consideration the seed of the male parent. Similarly, <i>of ‘ha’izim’</i> (<i>the goats</i>) <i>for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:10.</i> means of the <i>t’yashim</i> (the he-goats). <i>And if his offering be an ‘eiz’</i> (<i>a goat</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">Here in Verse 12.</i> means a male or female [since a peace-offering, which is the subject of this verse, can be brought either from the male or the femals]. So also, <i>And if his means suffice not for a ‘seh’</i> (<i>lamb</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 5:7.</i> means <i>a ewe-lamb or a she-goat</i> [as is expressly stated there in the preceding verse].<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 6. The section there deals with the offering of higher or lower value, Scripture first stating that where the offender can afford it he should bring as a sin-offering a ewe-lamb or a she-goat. Then follows the verse: <i>And if his means suffice not for a ‘seh’</i> (<i>lamb</i>). The word <i>seh</i> in this case must perforce mean a ewe-lamb or she-goat. Thus it is proven that Scripture uses the term <i>seh</i> also for the female.</i>

IF A SOUL SHALL SIN IN ERROR. Since the process of thinking is centered in the soul, and it is the soul which commits the error,<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">Up to this chapter the subjects dealt with have been the burnt-offering, the meal-offering, and the peace-offerings — all of which are voluntary and are not brought for the commission of sin. Here the subject is the sin-offering which is brought as an atonement for a certain sin committed in error. See above, Note 68.</i> Scripture mentions here <i>nefesh</i> (soul). The reason for the offerings for the erring soul is that all sins [even if committed unwittingly] produce a particular “stain” upon the soul and constitute a blemish thereon, and the soul is only worthy to be received by the countenance of its Creator when it is pure of all sin. Were it not so, then all the fools of the world would be deserving to come before Him. It is for this reason that the erring soul brings an offering, through which it becomes worthy of approaching <i>unto G-d who gave it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 12:7.</i> It is on account of this that Scripture mentions here <i>nefesh</i> (soul). Our Rabbis have interpreted:<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra Nedabah</i> 1:1.</i> “‘<i>Nefesh</i>’ (A soul) — this [word is used to] include proselytes and slaves” [thus teaching us that they too are under the obligation of bringing this offering, since the term <i>nefesh</i> is inclusive of them as well].<br>Now in the case of the sin-offering of the anointed priest [first discussed here in Verses 3-12], He does not say “and [the priest] shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven,” as He mentions in the case of other sinners — namely, the whole congregation,<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i> the prince,<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26.</i> and the common man.<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 31 and 35.</i> Perhaps the reason for this is that due to his great importance he cannot obtain atonement nor be forgiven completely until he prays and beseeches his G-d, <i>for he is the messenger of the Eternal of hosts</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 2:7.</i> and he must be of clean and pure hands [so that he can never be reproached with anything; hence in addition to the offering he must bring, he must also pray especially for forgiveness].<br>Scripture does not mention here, when speaking about the bulls which were to be entirely burnt,<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">These bulls were the sin-offering for the anointed priest (Verse 3), and that of the whole congregation of Israel (Verse 14). After their fats were burnt on the altar, these bulls were taken outside the camp and completely burnt (Verses 12 and 21). This was unlike the procedure done to the sin-offering of the prince and the common man, of which only the fats were burnt on the altar, whereas the meat was eaten by the priests (further, 6:17-23). Hence the name given to the first two categories of sin-offerings [“bulls to be entirely burnt”].</i> that the burning of those portions offered on the altar is “of a pleasing odor,” or that it is “a fire-offering unto the Eternal.” The reason for this is that since part of them is burnt outside [the camp of Israel], it is therefore not for “the fire unto the Eternal.” In the case of the goat of the prince [which he brings as his sin-offering],<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> He mentioned “atonement” [<i>and the priest shall make atonement for him</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26.</i> but did not state that it is “a fire-offering, of a pleasing odor unto the Eternal,” because the offering is a <i>sa’ir</i> (a goat).<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">This is like the <i>sa’ir</i> brought in case of idol worship (Numbers 15:24) (Ma’or V’shamesh). See also Ramban at the end of 3:1.</i> In the case of the sin-offering of the common person, He mentions that it is <i>for a pleasing odor unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> but does not mention “a fire-offering,” for it is self-understood that it is such, since the whole purpose of the fire-offering is to the Eternal. The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand.

WHEN THE SIN WHEREIN THEY HAVE SINNED IS KNOWN [THEN THE ASSEMBLY SHALL OFFER A YOUNG BULLOCK …]. It is self-understood that they cannot offer a sin-offering until they know that they have sinned. [So why does Scripture mention it?] But it is a linguistic expression of the [Hebrew] language to say, “and when it becomes known to them that they have sinned, they should bring their offering.” Therefore He did not mention it [in Verse 3] in the case of the anointed priest, because there was no need for it. It is possible that [the reason why the verse says, <i>when their sin wherein they have sinned is known</i>, is not merely as a linguistic expression but to indicate] that the assembly is not obliged to bring this sin-offering unless they have definite knowledge of their sin but not if it is merely a doubt, as in the case of the suspensive guilt-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>asham talui</i> (suspensive guilt-offering) is brought in case of doubt about one of those major sins for which the penalty if committed wilfully is excision, and a sin-offering if committed unintentionally. This offering is called a suspensive guilt-offering. An example of a case of a doubt which calls for such an offering is the following. Suppose a person has before him two pieces of fat, one of which is Scripturally-forbidden food, and the other is permitted to be eaten, and he eats one of the two [whilst the other is eaten by another person or lost]. A doubt then arises in his mind as to whether the piece he has eaten was the permitted or the forbidden food. In such a case he must bring an offering so as to effect atonement, and this is called a suspensive guilt-offering. If it is later established that he ate the forbidden fat, he must then bring a sin-offering (See Maimonides, “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 79-80). The point Ramban makes thus is that the verse before us teaches that the sin-offering of the assembly can be brought only when it is definitely confirmed that it has sinned [unintentionally], unlike the suspensive guilt-offering of the individual which is brought in case of doubt.</i> Our Rabbis have interpreted,<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Vayikra Chobah</i> 4:12; Horayoth 5a.</i> [that the verse says, <i>the sin … is known</i>, to teach that] “if the court knew that they had given an [incorrect] decision [on one of two kinds of forbidden food, such as fat and blood, declaring that one of them may be eaten], but did not know which one it was that they permitted, [and the people had eaten both], I might think that the court is obligated to bring a sin-offering [as they usually are when they give an incorrect decision which the people followed]. Scripture therefore says, <i>when ‘the’ sin wherein they have sinned is known</i> — not when only the sinners are known.”<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">In that case “the sinners” are known [i.e., it is known that the majority of the people relied on the mistaken decision and ate one of the forbidden foods, under which circumstances the court usually must bring a sin-offering for their mistaken ruling]. The particular “sin,” however, is not known, since the court does not know which of the forbidden foods it was that they incorrectly ruled to be permitted. In such a case, this verse teaches us that they do not bring a sin-offering. Horayoth 7b.</i> This is not mentioned in the case [of the sin-offering] of the anointed priest, since He said there: <i>If the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 3.</i> thus declaring [the law of the sin-offering of] the anointed priest to be like that of the public.

Similarly, <i>‘o’ it be known that the ox was wont to gore</i><sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:36.</i> [means ‘if’ it be known, and the word <i>o</i> which ordinarily means ‘or’ is here used in the sense of ‘<i>im</i>,’ meaning ‘if’].” Thus the language of Rashi.<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: “The sense of <i>asher nasi yechta</i> is as if the expression were inverted, making it read: <i>asher yechta nasi</i> (if ‘he who sins is the prince’), and it is connected with [the section] above, <i>And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> It is thus as if He had stated here: ‘and if he who sins is the prince [and he knows it of himself], or his sin be made known to him by others.’ Scripture, however, adopts a short form of expression, [omitting to state ‘that he knows the sin himself,’ or that it was made known to him ‘through others’], but the meaning is that either it becomes known to the prince by himself that he sinned, ‘<i>o hoda eilav</i>’ (<i>or it be made known to him</i>) — i.e., that another man who saw him doing it informed him of it. The grammatical form of <i>hoda</i> is then a past causative [like <i>hodi’a</i> — a man ‘informed’ him], this being similar to ‘<i>v’heitzar lecha</i>’<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:25.</i> [the meaning of which is as if it said ‘<i>v’heitzir lecha</i>’ in the causative, i.e., <i>and he will besiege thee</i>]. The subject, however, is missing [for it should have said here, or ‘another man’ inform him, and there it should have stated, and ‘the enemy’ will besiege thee], just as ‘<i>asher’ bore her to Levi</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 26:59.</i> [which should have read ‘<i>asher ishto</i>’ (<i>whose wife</i>) <i>bore her to Levi</i>]. [All these are the words of Ibn Ezra.].<br>But there is no need for all this, since the uses of the word <i>asher</i> are many. In some cases it indicates time, such as: ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>Joseph came unto his brethren;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 37:23.</i> ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>they had eaten up the corn</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 43:2.</i> and the like. Similarly, here too [<i>asher</i> is like <i>ka’asher</i> and indicates time]: ‘<i>when’ a prince sinneth</i>, with the <i>kaf</i> of cognizance [which would make it <i>ka’asher</i> — “when”] missing. So also, <i>The blessing, ‘asher’ ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 11:27.</i> means ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>ye shall hearken. ‘Asher’ ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall see them again no more</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">323</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 14:13.</i> means ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>ye have seen them</i> [today ye shall see them no more]. <i>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread ‘asher’ I commanded thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">324</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:18.</i> means ‘<i>ka’asher</i>’ (<i>when</i>) <i>I commanded thee</i>. At times this word [<i>asher</i>] is missing [not a <i>kaf</i> but] a <i>beth</i>. Thus: <i>And also Maacah his mother he</i> [King Asa of Judah] <i>removed from being queen, ‘asher’ she made an abominable image for an Asherah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 15:13.</i> means <i>‘ba’asher’ she made an abominable image for an Asherah</i>, which denotes “because,” just like, ‘<i>ba’asher’</i> (<i>because</i>) <i>thou art his wife</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 39:9.</i> The expression <i>o hoda eilav</i> [is thus not a causative, as Ibn Ezra would have it, which would make it to mean “or that it was made known to him by another person;” rather, it] refers to the guilt, stating that when a person will <i>do any one of all the things which the Eternal his G-d hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22 here.</i> and deserving of punishment, or it be known to him and he will achieve atonement by means of an offering. The sense of the verse is thus: “he will either be guilty [and deserving of punishment], or bring an offering and he will be forgiven.” The reason for the expression: <i>the Eternal his G-d</i>, is to state that even though he is the king, and the lord upon whom there is no fear of mortal man, he is yet to fear <i>the Eternal his G-d</i>, for it is He who is <i>the Lord of lords</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 10:17.</i> Similarly, <i>that he</i> (the king) <i>may learn to fear the Eternal his G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:19.</i> means that the king is to take to heart [the knowledge] that there is a Supreme One above him, Who is his G-d and in Whose power is his life and kingdom.

AND THE REMAINING BLOOD THEREOF SHALL HE POUR OUT AT THE BASE OF THE ALTAR OF BURNT-OFFERING. This is the same altar already mentioned [in the first part of the verse: <i>and he shall put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering</i>]. But such is the linguistic expression of the [Hebrew] language to mention the subject instead of [merely] the definite article [thus repeating “of burnt-offering” rather than just saying “the altar”]. Similarly, <i>and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and he shall slaughter the bullock</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 4.</i> Our Rabbis have Midrashic interpretations on these verses, for <i>the law of the Eternal is perfect</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">331</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:8.</i> there being nothing in it which is omitted or redundant.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

AND HE IS A WITNESS, WHETHER HE HATH SEEN OR KNOWN<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">The section here discusses the offering of higher or lower value (see above, Note 15), the verse before us stating that this offering is required in the case of a false oath concerning testimony. Thus, if the person interested in the evidence called upon him by an oath, adjuring him that if he knows any evidence favorable to him he should testify before the court, and he swore that he knows of no testimony concerning him, when in fact he does know, in such a case, if he swore either unintentionally or wilfully, he must offer what is called an offering of higher or lower value. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 82-83. In the following verse another transgression for which this offering is required is mentioned. — Ramban now proceeds to explain the sense of the triple expression, <i>and he is a witness, or knows, or saw</i>.</i> These are not three separate matters, for it is impossible that one be a witness without seeing and knowing. Rather, Scripture is stating that if one <i>hear the voice of adjuration</i> that a party to a law-suit adjures him, concerning a matter in which he is a witness either by seeing or knowing of it, <i>if he does not tell it</i> he has committed an iniquity. Now the witness is not obligated to bring this offering unless he knows such a testimony that the party in suit who adjured him [to give witness] would have legally won his case because of it [and the witness nonetheless withheld his evidence]. It is for this reason that our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">333</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 33b.</i> interpreted [on the basis of the verse before us] that there is testimony which is valid by seeing without knowing, and [testimony which is valid] by knowing without seeing. How so? [Reuben says to Shimon:] “I have delivered to thee a maneh<sup class="footnote-marker">334</sup><i class="footnote">A Hebrew unit of weight and value, equal to the sixtieth part of a talent.</i> [as a loan] in the presence of such-and-such persons,” and [Shimon] claims “this never happened,<sup class="footnote-marker">335</sup><i class="footnote">And Shimon claims: “Let such and such persons come and testify that they saw you [Reuben] delivering me the money, and I will pay you” (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> let the witnesses [you claim to have], come and testify.” This is a case of seeing without knowing [since although they saw Reuben handing the money to Shimon, they do not know the nature of this delivery, whether it was as a loan, or repayment of a loan that Shimon had originally made to him].<sup class="footnote-marker">336</sup><i class="footnote">But since Shimon denied that this transaction had ever taken place, and says that if Reuben can produce the witnesses he claims he has to testify that they saw Reuben delivering him money, he will pay Reuben — then the witnesses’ testimony that they <i>saw</i> Reuben giving Shimon money is sufficiently valid to obligate Shimon to pay Reuben, although they did not <i>know</i> the nature of that transaction. If therefore they withhold their testimony, they are liable to bring the offering dealt with here.</i> [If Reuben says to Shimon:] “You have admitted to owing me a maneh,<sup class="footnote-marker">334</sup><i class="footnote">A Hebrew unit of weight and value, equal to the sixtieth part of a talent.</i> in the presence of such-and-such persons,” [and Shimon replies]: “let them come and testify,” this is a case of knowing without seeing [and even though they did not see, they must testify what they know, and hence are liable if they withhold their evidence].<br>But in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, we need not [explain] the “seeing” here [to mean seeing] without knowing. Rather, the sense of the verse is as follows: <i>whether he hath seen</i>, meaning that he saw the loan or the sale completely [i.e., with knowledge], <i>or known</i>, i.e., that he heard [the defendants to the suit] admitting that transaction in the presence of witnesses, but he did not see it.<br>Now He does not state here: “and it is hidden from him,” [as He does in the following verse], because in this case [where the witness swears that he knows of no testimony for the party that adjures him to come and testify before the court], he is obligated to bring the offering [mentioned here in these verses] whether he swore [entirely] wilfully, or was in error on the oath whilst wilfully denying his knowledge of evidence. If, however, at the time of giving the oath he had forgotten the testimony, there is no guilt upon him.

Verse 2

AND IT IS HIDDEN FROM HIM<sup class="footnote-marker">337</sup><i class="footnote">This is the second type of case for which the offering of higher or lower value is required. It is known as “the defilement of the Sanctuary or its hallowed things.” Thus if a person who has been made unclean by any of the primary sources of uncleanness, unintentionally enters the Sanctuary, or unintentionally eats meat that is holy, he must bring the above-mentioned offering. A third — and final — case is if one swears an oath of utterance [“I shall eat” or “I shall not eat” and the like], and unintentionally fails to keep it. In this case too he is required to bring this offering.</i> — “that is, he had forgotten his state of uncleanness. AND HE INCURRED GUILT — by eating holy food or by entering the Sanctuary.” This is Rashi’s language. Now [Rashi’s] intent is not that the [requirement of] eating the holy food or entering the Sanctuary is derived from the word <i>v’asheim</i> (and he incurred guilt), for this word is used with reference to all the sin-offerings mentioned previously.<sup class="footnote-marker">338</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Chapter 4, Verses 13, 22, and 27.</i> But this section deals in a brief manner with those points which are self-understood. For there is no sin involved in touching a carcass of an unclean beast or swarming thing [which defiles the person]. Even the priests have not been warned against it. So it is impossible that Scripture should require a person to bring an offering just because he touched them and thereby became defiled. Rather, Scripture is stating that when a person becomes defiled and forgets his state of uncleanness, or when he swears [an “oath of utterance”]<sup class="footnote-marker">337</sup><i class="footnote">This is the second type of case for which the offering of higher or lower value is required.

In this case too he is required to bring this offering.</i> and forgets the oath, and he incurs guilt by violating it — for either of these sins committed through forgetfulness, he is required to bring an offering. Now it is self-understood that the mere forgetfulness of his state of uncleanness involves no sin, except [if in that state] he ate holy food or entered the Sanctuary. Nor is there any sin in the mere forgetfulness of an oath, except if he violated it. This is the literal explanation of the verses in this section. Our Rabbis have further interpretations on this section strengthening this explanation.

Verse 5

AND HE SHALL CONFESS THAT WHEREIN HE HATH SINNED. 6. AND HE SHALL BRING HIS GUILT-OFFERING. This was not the [order of the] procedure.<sup class="footnote-marker">339</sup><i class="footnote">For the offering had to be brought first, then the laying of hands was performed during which [while his hands lay on the offering] he confessed his sin (see Note 64 above). Hence the expression <i>and he shall bring his guilt-offering</i> must mean “and he who comes to bring an offering to effect atonement for his guilt … ”</i> Rather, he first brought the sin-offering and laid his hands upon it, and then confessed, similarly to that which is [explicitly] said further on, <i>And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">340</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:21.</i> Here, however, Scripture does not state “and he shall lay his hand,” because He explained previously in the case of all sin-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">341</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Chapter 4, Verses 4, 15, 24 and 29.</i> that they require the laying of hands, and similarly, in the case of freewill offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">342</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 1, Verse 4; Chapter 3, Verses 2, 8 and 13. See also Note 11 above.</i> But He did not explain [the duty of] confession above in the case of the other sin-offerings, [although it is required in those cases as well].<br>In line with the simple meaning of Scripture it would appear that here He said <i>and he shall confess</i>, because in the case of an “oath of testimony”<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">The section here discusses the offering of higher or lower value (see above, Note 15), the verse before us stating that this offering is required in the case of a false oath concerning testimony. Thus, if the person interested in the evidence called upon him by an oath, adjuring him that if he knows any evidence favorable to him he should testify before the court, and he swore that he knows of no testimony concerning him, when in fact he does know, in such a case, if he swore either unintentionally or wilfully, he must offer what is called an offering of higher or lower value. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 82-83. In the following verse another transgression for which this offering is required is mentioned. — Ramban now proceeds to explain the sense of the triple expression, <i>and he is a witness, or knows, or saw</i>.</i> the offering is to be brought even if the oath was taken wilfully. So also in the case of an “oath of deposit”<sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">If Reuben says to Shimon, “Give me my deposit which you have,” and Shimon replies “I swear I have naught of yours,” or if Shimon said, “I have naught of yours,” and Reuben says, “I adjure thee” and he answers “Amen” — in this case too Shimon is liable to bring an offering [in addition to the restitution] even if he wilfully swore falsely. The offering, however, is not the one of higher or lower value mentioned in this section — but a guilt-offering, as explained further on (in Verses 23-26). Ramban mentions the “oath of deposit” here only to liken it to the “oath of testimony” in the sense that the offerings in each case are brought even if committed wilfully. This is a novel point in the law of offerings, for all other offerings brought for commission of a sin effect atonement only in case the transgression has been committed in error; otherwise, <i>the offering of the wicked is an abomination</i> (Proverbs 21:27). Ramban thus suggests [in line with the plain meaning of Scripture] that since the offerings in these two cases — that of the “oath of testimony” and the “oath of deposit” — are required to be brought even when committed wilfully, therefore the Torah mentions in their cases the subject of confession. But in the case of all other sin-offerings, since they are brought only when the transgression was committed in error, there is no need for confession of sin. However, Ramban will immediately refute this position, for the Rabbis have clearly interpreted that all sin-offerings require confession of sin.</i> He mentioned, <i>then they shall confess their sin which they have done</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">344</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 5:7.</i> But in the case of the sin-offering brought for transgression in error, He did not mention confession.<sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote">“But [when bringing] the sin-offering for a sin committed in error he does not confess” (Tur in quoting the language of Ramban).</i> But in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">346</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre <i>Zuta</i> 5:5.</i> the expression, <i>and he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned</i>, refers to everything mentioned in this section, including the defiling of the Sanctuary and the holy food, and an “oath of utterance,”<sup class="footnote-marker">337</sup><i class="footnote">This is the second type of case for which the offering of higher or lower value is required. It is known as “the defilement of the Sanctuary or its hallowed things.” Thus if a person who has been made unclean by any of the primary sources of uncleanness, unintentionally enters the Sanctuary, or unintentionally eats meat that is holy, he must bring the above-mentioned offering.

He mentioned confession, however, [specifically] here because the “oath of testimony” and the “oath of utterance” do not make one liable to excision [if done wilfully, unlike the sin-offering which is brought only for those sins committed in error which, if committed wilfully, incur the punishment of excision], and yet He requires confession in these cases, and [thus it follows] all the more that in the case of the fixed<sup class="footnote-marker">347</sup><i class="footnote">As distinct from the offering of higher or lower value, where the offering varies according to the means of the transgressor, a fixed sin-offering must be of an animal and is alike for poor and rich, so that if the poor cannot afford it he is not obligated to bring another offering in its stead, as is the case of the offering of higher or lower value. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 78-79.</i> sin-offerings mentioned above, he must confess [since his sin, were it to be committed wilfully, would incur] the penalty of excision. Our Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">348</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre <i>Naso</i> 2.</i> that the expression here, <i>and he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned</i> is a general principle in the case of all sin-offerings, that they require confession. The verses written in the section of <i>Naso</i>, stating, <i>and that soul shall be guilty. Then they shall confess their sin which they have done</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">349</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 5:6-7.</i> is to include all guilt-offerings [in the requirement of confession]. So it is explained in the Sifre.<sup class="footnote-marker">348</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre <i>Naso</i> 2.</i> There the Rabbis have interpreted: “<i>And that soul shall be guilty. Then they shall confess</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">349</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 5:6-7.</i> This establishes the general rule for all those executed [by the court] that they require confession” [to achieve full forgiveness of their sin].

Verse 6



Verse 7

AND IF HIS MEANS SUFFICE NOT FOR A LAMB. Scripture has been lenient towards these sinners by allowing them to bring an offering of either higher or lower value. It is possible that the reason for the leniency with regard to the offering in the case of oaths [i.e., the “oath of testimony” and the “oath of utterance”, as explained above] is because the punishment is not excision [were they to be done wilfully]. In the case of defilement of the Sanctuary and the holy food [He mitigated the obligation of the offering] because the person who did it erred whilst engaged in performing a religious duty, for the priest who eats the holy food or enters into the Sanctuary to prostrate himself or to bring an offering is engaged in performing a religious duty, and his intention is towards Heaven. Therefore even though he sinned on account of having forgotten his state of uncleanness, Scripture gave him more ways of atonement.<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that the reason why one [of the two birds brought by the poor man in the offering of higher or lower value] was a burnt-offering, is so that it should be offered on the altar in lieu of the fats of the animal sin-offering [brought by the affluent person].<sup class="footnote-marker">350</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in view of the fact that nothing of the bird sin-offering is burnt on the altar, while the fats of the animal sin-offering are burnt thereon, Scripture therefore required that the poor man who cannot afford the animal offering, should bring two birds, one for a sin-offering [which is the required offering in this case], and an additional bird as a burnt-offering, to take the place of the fats of the animal sin-offering.</i> He has explained it well.

AND HE SHALL BRING ‘ASHAMO’ (HIS GUILT-OFFERING) UNTO THE ETERNAL. This offering is called <i>asham</i> (“guilt-offering” — as distinguished from the sin-offering), just as He has said [here in the verse] <i>after the shekel of the Sanctuary, for a guilt-offering</i>. But <i>he shall bring ‘ashamo’ unto the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">351</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 6. In this case the word ‘<i>ashamo</i>’ [literally, “guilt”] is not the name of the offering, but merely indicates “the offering — i.e., a sin-offering — brought because of guilt.”</i> mentioned above in the case of the offering of higher and lower value means, “and he shall bring his offering unto the Eternal,” for that offering was a sin-offering, as He said, <i>a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">351</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 6.

We cannot say that the reason is since the sin-offering is a female [unlike the guilt-offering which is male, and therefore the word <i>asham</i> which is masculine cannot be applied to the female sin-offering], for there are sin-offerings which are male — namely the goats [brought as sin-offerings in case of the public worshipping idols,<sup class="footnote-marker">352</sup><i class="footnote">A male goat is brought as a sin-offering by the prince (above, 4:23), and by the public for worshipping idols (Numbers 15:24), as well as on the Day of Atonement (further, 16:5).

Possibly it is a paraphrase of the verses in Jeremiah 9:9-10, where the prophet bewails the emptiness of the destroyed <i>pastures of the wilderness</i>, and predicts that the cities of Judah will be <i>sh’mama</i> (wasted away). Thus both phrases occur in juxtaposition, and Ramban deduces therefrom the underlying idea of the root <i>shamam</i>. Perhaps it is a combination of Isaiah 24:6 [where the word <i>vaye’shmu</i> — “and they wasted away”] and Joel 1:19 [where <i>the pastures of the wilderness</i>] are mentioned.</i> So also: ‘<i>Te’sham Shomron</i>’ (<i>Samaria shall be laid waste</i>), <i>for she hath rebelled against her G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">357</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 14:1.</i> and <i>we are ‘asheimim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">358</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 42:21. Thus in place of the usual translation “we are guilty” [concerning our brother] Ramban interprets it to mean “we are being punished” on account of our brother.</i> — means “we are being punished.” The word <i>chatath</i> (sin) denotes something which has turned aside off the way, this being of the expression, <i>every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth and not ‘yachti’</i> (<i>miss</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">359</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 20:16.</i> Now the guilt-offering for robberies,<sup class="footnote-marker">360</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 21-25.</i> and the guilt-offering for carnally knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage<sup class="footnote-marker">361</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 19:20-22.</i> would then be called <i>asham</i> [indicating a serious sin] because they have to be brought even for wilful commission of the sin.

The guilt-offering for misusing sanctified objects,<sup class="footnote-marker">363</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 15-16.</i> however, even though it is brought only when the sin was committed in error, yet because it concerns <i>the holy things of the Eternal</i>, it is called <i>asham</i>, because the great sin that he did makes him deserve to be <i>shameim</i> (destroyed) because of it, even as it is called <i>me’ilah</i> (treachery).<sup class="footnote-marker">364</sup><i class="footnote">'<i>Ki thim’ol ma’al</i>’ (<i>if any one commit a treachery</i>) (in Verse 15).</i> The reason for the name [<i>asham</i>] of the leper’s offering<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">The leper’s first offering [on the day he is cleansed] is the guilt-offering (further, 14:12).

In the light of the above explanation of the term <i>asham</i>, Ramban suggests a reason why the leper brings the two offerings at the same time when both atone for sin, and why the guilt-offering first. There is indeed a third offering — namely, the burnt-offering — that the leper brought on that day (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 20).

See also Rashi on Verse 18 [speaking of the suspensive guilt-offering]: “<i>a ram … with thy valuation</i> — according to the value stated above” [in Verse 15, i.e., at least two shekels].</i> whilst if the sin is confirmed, he brings a sin-offering which could be worth only a <i>danka</i> [a small Persian coin — the sixth of a <i>denar</i>]. Scripture calls it <i>asham</i> in order to say that it must be worth two <i>s’laim</i> just like the graver guilt-offerings [i.e., like the guilt-offering brought for appropriating sanctified objects, and that brought for carnally knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage, which must be worth at least two <i>s’laim</i>], thus indicating to the sinner [since he is in doubt as to whether he has sinned], that if he treats it lightly and will not bring his [offering for] atonement, he will be destroyed by his sin. This is the sense of the verse, ‘<i>Asham hu, ashom asham lashem</i>’ (<i>It is a guilt-offering — he hath surely incurred guilt before the Eternal</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">369</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i> That is to say, although this offering is brought only on a doubtful sin, <i>it is a guilt-offering</i>, for he has surely incurred guilt before the Eternal Who knows all hidden things, and if indeed he did sin before Him, He will requite him.

The question arose (see Ramban at beginning of this verse), why the Torah calls it <i>ashamo</i> (his guilt-offering) when it is really a sin-offering — Ramban now proposes to answer that “it is because etc.”</i> is because among those sins mentioned above are also those which require the bringing of an offering even when they are committed wilfully, such as for the “oath of testimony; ”<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">The section here discusses the offering of higher or lower value (see above, Note 15), the verse before us stating that this offering is required in the case of a false oath concerning testimony.

See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 82-83. In the following verse another transgression for which this offering is required is mentioned. — Ramban now proceeds to explain the sense of the triple expression, <i>and he is a witness, or knows, or saw</i>.</i> therefore He mentions the term <i>asham</i> with reference to them although the offering is called a sin-offering.<br>Also by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], a female offering for a sin is called <i>chatath</i> (sin-offering), and the male offering is called <i>asham</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">371</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the determining factor for the difference in the names between the <i>chatath</i> and the <i>asham</i> is whether the offering is male or female.

Chapter 6



Verse 1



Verse 2

TZAV’ (COMMAND) AARON. In the [preceding] section of <i>Vayikra</i>, Scripture stated, <i>Speak unto the children of Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:2.</i> for there He gave the command about the bringing of the offerings, and it is upon the Israelites to bring them. But here He states, <i>Command Aaron and his sons</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the question arises: Why are these two sections addressed differently?</i> for He now speaks of the rites of the offerings and these are performed by the priests.<br>Now Rashi wrote: “<i>Command Aaron</i>. The expression ‘command …’ always implies urging [to fulfill the command] at once, and also for future generations. Rabbi Shimon said: Scripture found it especially necessary to urge, in cases where fulfillment of a command involves monetary loss.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since Rashi understood Rabbi Shimon’s statement as referring to the burnt-offering, it must be understood as follows: In the case of all other offerings, the priest eats part of the meat and thus derives some personal benefit, therefore he does not have to be urged on to perform their rites. In the case of the burnt-offering, however, he derives no benefit, since it is completely burnt on the altar; hence Scripture [speaking here of <i>the law of the burnt-offering</i>], preceded it by the expression, <i>‘command’ Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the burnt-offering</i>, in order to urge them on to fulfill the commandment. — Ramban, however, argues that even from the burnt-offering the priests do derive a personal benefit, namely, the hide (further, 7:8). Accordingly he will interpret Rabbi Shimon’s statement as referring to another matter, as he explains further on.</i> But the explanation of Rabbi Shimon was not [said] with reference to this command, for here there is no monetary loss involved to the priests to whom this command was given. Indeed, they gain profit and reward from all the offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The meat of the sin-offering and the guilt-offering is eaten completely by the priests. They are also given a share of the peace-offering (further, 7:34). The residue of the meal-offering after the handful was burnt on the altar, was eaten by the priests (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 9).</i> even the burnt-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the hide of the animal which belongs to the priest (further, 7:8). — Rashi, however, considered this share of little value and hence he understood Rabbi Shimon’s statement as applying to the burnt-offering, and that this was why the expression “command …” is mentioned here, namely, because the priests incur a monetary loss, and hence they had to be urged on to fulfill the command. — Thus according to Rashi, Rabbi Shimon differs with the First Sage, (<i>Tanna Kamma</i>) [when a Mishnah or a Beraitha cites a number of different authorities, and the first authority is mentioned annonymously, that opinion generally is referred to that of the <i>Tanna Kamma</i>] who said that the expression “command …” is mentioned here because it is a commandment binding at once and also for future generations, while Rabbi Shimon holds that this is not the reason for its use; instead, the reason for the expression “command …” is because in attending to the burnt-offering the priests suffer a monetary loss, and hence they have to be urged on. Ramban, however, argues that even in the case of burnt-offerings the priests incur no monetary loss, since they keep the hides, hence Rabbi Shimon also agrees with the First Sage that the reason for the use of the expression “command …” in this context is because it is a command binding at once and for future generations. Ramban then continues by saying that Rabbi Shimon’s statement has no bearing on our subject of the burnt-offering, but its meaning is as will be explained further on.</i> Rather, the intention of the First Sage [whom Rashi quoted] in saying, “the expression ‘command …’ always implies urging [to fulfill the command] at once and also for future generations,” was to say that in those sections of the Torah where Scripture wanted to urge fulfillment, saying that they should be fulfilled immediately and that they apply throughout the generations, it uses this expression of “command …” But in other sections it will say, “speak” to the children of Israel, or “say” unto them. With this [generalization] Rabbi Shimon differed, saying that sometimes<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in other places. But here [in the case of the burnt-offering] Rabbi Shimon agrees with the reason stated by the First Sage. See Note 5 above.</i> this expression [“command … “] occurs in a matter which is not to be fulfilled immediately and throughout the generations, but it is used because the command involves a monetary loss. Such [a use of the word] “command” is that found in the case of the oil of the lighting<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 24:2: <i>Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light</i> …</i> [where, according to Rabbi Shimon, the expression “command …” is used because it applies immediately and for all generations, as well as for the reason that it involves a monetary loss], and that which Scripture states, <i>Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 35:2.</i> [which is a case where the use of the expression “command” can only be because monetary loss is involved, since it did not apply at once, but only after they had taken possession of the Land].<br>It is possible that we say that our command does involve a monetary loss to the priests, as a result of that which it says further on [in this section], <i>This is the offering of Aaron and his sons</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 13. This is interpreted by the Sages to mean that the High Priest is to bring a meal-offering every day, half of it in the morning and half thereof in the evening. The ordinary priest brought such a meal-offering at his installation into the priestly office, and it was known as the “meal-offering of initiation.” Since the money for these meal-offerings does not come from the public treasury but from the priests themselves, there is thus a monetary loss incurred by them, and hence the expression “Command Aaron and his sons …” with which this section opens. If this is so, Rabbi Shimon’s statement does refer to this section and Rashi was therefore correct in citing his words here — as being <i>an additional reason</i> to that of the First Sage as to why the expression “command …” is mentioned here. However, etc. (see text).</i> which is a continuation of this command. However, at the beginning of the Sifre,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Sifre.” This is the version found in all texts of Ramban — but it should be “Sifra,” as it is found here in Torath Kohanim at the beginning of the <i>Seder</i>. See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 121.</i> the opinions [of the First Sage and that of Rabbi Shimon] are taught in a manner indicating that they hold opposing views.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intent is as follows: When in a Tannaitic text the opinion of a second Sage is mentioned in the words: “Rabbi … says,” it indicates that he differs with the opinion of the First Sage. Where, however, it states: “Said Rabbi …” it usually means that he agrees with the former opinion, but he makes an additional point to strengthen it further. Here, however, [in the text of the Sifra before Ramban] it states: “Rabbi Shimon says,” and hence indicates that he <i>differs</i> with the opinion of the First Sage. [It must be noted though that the Sifra text that <i>we</i> have has: “Said Rabbi Shimon,” which vindicates that there is no difference of opinion between the two Sages. Ramban’s Sifra text perforce must have had the reading: “Rabbi Shimon says …” A similar reading is found in the Sifre <i>Naso</i> 1: “Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai says … “]</i>
THIS IS ‘TORATH’ (THE LAW OF) THE BURNT-OFFERING. “This text is intended to teach us that the burning of the fats and limbs of offerings is valid [if performed anytime] during the whole night [following the day on which they were slaughtered]. It is also intended to teach us which of the disqualified offerings, although already brought up on to the altar, must be taken down, and which of them if already brought up need not be taken down. For all expressions of <i>torath</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In our Rashi text: <i>torah</i>.</i> [introducing a group of laws] denote inclusion — one law for all offerings that are brought up on to the altar, including some disqualified ones, namely that if they are already brought up on to the altar, they need not be taken down.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But this law does not [in fact] apply to <i>everything</i> that has already been brought up on to the altar, but only to all offerings proper, for if drink-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 15:3-12 for the command that burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings had to be accompanied by an offering of wine.</i> are brought on to the altar [when they are not supposed to be] they must be taken down; and even if the libations are correctly offered up and the offering is disqualified, or the offering is correctly offered up and the libations disqualified, and definitely where both are disqualified — in all these cases, the offering itself is not to be taken down again, and the libations are to be taken down! For such is the sense of the inclusive term <i>torath ha’olah</i> (<i>the law of the burnt-offering</i>), teaching, “one law for all that goeth up [as the due of the altar-fires]” but not for the drink-offerings [since they are not poured on the fires, but into a silver bowl placed at the south-west corner of the altar],<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Succah 48a. There were two such bowls there, one for the wine-libation and the other for the special water-libation on the Festival of Succoth (see in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 219). “The bowl to the west was for water and that to the east was for wine” (<i>ibid.</i>, 48 b).</i> nor for the blood [which was sprinkled on the sides of the altar], in accordance with the words of Rabbi Yehoshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 83 a.</i><br>Now this verse [also] teaches that we should not <i>offer</i> the burnt-offering at night, but if it was slaughtered and its blood sprinkled [on the altar] during the daytime, we may burn its limbs all night, the same law applying to the fats of the peace-offering. And the explanation of the expression ‘<i>hi ha’olah</i>’ is as if it said: ‘<i>tiheyeh’ ha’olah</i> (the burnt-offering “shall be”) <i>on the firewood upon the altar all night</i>. He uses the word <i>hi</i> [literally: “she”] in order to exclude<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For just as the term <i>torah</i> (law) denotes inclusion (one law for all things), so does the word <i>hi</i> (“she” or “it”) denote exclusion, implying that the law under consideration does not apply to everything but is limited in its scope. It is the Sages who in their interpretation of the law determine in which cases it applies and in which it does not.</i> those things which the Rabbis have specified in the interpretation thereof. Now according to the [Rabbinical] interpretation this verse does not teach us that we are to bring up the limbs [of the offerings] from the ground to the altar at night, for this [principle] they have already derived from another verse, <i>Neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:18.</i> [which the Sages interpreted<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Mechilta <i>ibid</i>. See also Ramban there.</i> to mean, “<i>Neither shall the fat of My feast remain</i> on the stone pavement of the Court below, <i>all night until the morning</i>, but you should bring it up to the altar”]. For it is from that verse that the Rabbis have derived the law that [fats and limbs of the offerings] become disqualified [for the altar] if they remained upon the pavement [until the morning], but they may be brought up to the altar at any time during the night. Here Scripture speaks of those limbs which had already been brought up during daytime, [to teach] that the priest turns them over on the altar during the whole night until the morning. It is for this reason that He says <i>hi ha’olah</i> [using the definite article], meaning: “the one which has already come up” on the altar. It also teaches us that even those that are invalid, are not to be brought down again, [once they were taken up onto the altar], provided they became invalid in the Court of the Sanctuary [such as where they had remained overnight or had been unclean, etc.; but if they became invalid before reaching the Sanctuary Court, such as an animal that had been set apart for idolatry, or had been worshipped etc., these must be brought down].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Zebachim 84a for full discussion of these cases.</i> It also teaches that [invalid] drink-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 15:3-12 for the command that burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings had to be accompanied by an offering of wine.</i> must come down [since they do not go upon the fires on the altar],<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Succah 48a.

AND THE FIRE OF THE ALTAR SHALL BE BLAZING IN IT. Scripture is stating that it should burn on the altar during the whole night, it being a positive commandment that the priests should put on at daytime a lot of wood in order that it should not be burnt up completely and the fire [should not] become extinguished from it [during the night]. In my opinion, that which He said, <i>Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 6. Ramban thus explains the impersonal language [“shall be kept burning”] as a command addressed to the priests.</i> is a commandment directed to the priests to keep fire burning continually upon the altar, just as He said, <i>and the priest shall kindle wood upon it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5.</i> commanding them that they should be careful about this — to set fire in order and put enough wood on it to keep the fire burning continually, all day and all night. He gave an additional caution by means of a negative commandment, [<i>it shall not go out</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 6. Ramban thus explains the impersonal language [“shall be kept burning”] as a command addressed to the priests.</i> meaning that it should never be allowed to become extinguished. Thus if the priests were careless and the fire became extinguished they would transgress this negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See further, Note 25 where Ramban differs with Rashi in interpreting the expression ‘<i>lo thichbeh</i>’ (<i>it shall not go out</i>) which appears both in Verse 5 and Verse 6. Consequently Ramban writes here “in my opinion,” alluding to the fact that this is not in consonance with Rashi’s interpretation.</i> It is for this reason that our Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 22 b.</i> that [in addition to the large wood-stack burning on the altar] there was a second wood-stack solely for the purpose of keeping up the fire. And that which Scripture states, <i>And the fire upon the altar shall be blazing in it; it shall not go out</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5.</i> is a redundant verse, and is therefore interpreted by our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 2:7.</i> as having reference to all people, teaching that whoever extinguishes the fire, transgresses a negative commandment. Even if he extinguishes only one of the live coals of the wood-stack, he is liable to whipping, whether he put it out on top of the altar, or whether he extinguished it below [on the pavement of the Court] after he had taken it down. It appears to me that he violates only one negative commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intent is to allude to Rashi who wrote [in Verse 6]: “One who extinguishes the fire on the altar transgresses <i>two</i> negative commandments” [i.e., ‘<i>lo thichbeh</i>’ (<i>it shall not go out</i>) mentioned in Verse 5 and again in Verse 6]. According to Ramban, however, as explained above, the second <i>lo thichbeh</i> is a special prohibition to the priests who look after the altar not to be careless in permitting the fire to be extinguished. Hence there is only one verse [5] referring to <i>any</i> person who extinguishes the fire on the altar. Hence Ramban’s expression, “It appears to me that he violates only one negative commandment.”</i>

Verse 3

AND THE PRIEST SHALL PUT ON ‘MIDO’ (HIS GARMENT OF) LINEN. “This is a reference to the <i>k’toneth</i> (tunic). Why then does Scripture here call it <i>mido</i> [which means ‘his measure’]? It is to indicate that the tunic is to be made to his measure. AND HIS LINEN BREECHES SHALL HE PUT UPON HIS FLESH — that there should be nothing interposing between them.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>Now the [daily] removal of the ashes [from the altar, which is the subject-matter of this verse], must be done with the priest wearing the [four] garments of priesthood,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The ordinary priest ministered in four garments: the tunic, breeches, turban, and the belt. To these the High Priest added four more pieces of raiment: the breastplate, the ephod, the robe and the frontlet. — The question then appears: since removing the ashes from the altar had to be done by a priest, why does Scripture here single out only two of the garments, the tunic and the breeches? — The taking up of the ashes was the very first act in the day’s Service in the Sanctuary. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 38-39.</i> as no Service can be performed with only two of the [four] garments! However, He mentioned only these two garments because of new points that are added here to them, namely, that the tunic must be made to the priest’s measure. This means to say that if it was raised [above his feet], being so short that it did not reach his feet, and he performed therein one of the acts of offering, his Service is invalid. It further teaches that there must be nothing intervening between the breeches and his flesh. But the law requires equally that the priest who removes the ashes from the altar should wear all [four] priestly garments, for since Scripture mentioned that the removing of the ashes must be done with priestly garments, we know [automatically] that it requires four for the common priest and eight for the High Priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The ordinary priest ministered in four garments: the tunic, breeches, turban, and the belt. To these the High Priest added four more pieces of raiment: the breastplate, the ephod, the robe and the frontlet. — The question then appears: since removing the ashes from the altar had to be done by a priest, why does Scripture here single out only two of the garments, the tunic and the breeches? — The taking up of the ashes was the very first act in the day’s Service in the Sanctuary. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 38-39.</i> So also is it explained in the second chapter of Tractate Yoma<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 23b.</i> and in Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 2:1.</i> “Why does Scripture repeat the term <i>yilbash</i> [‘he shall put on’ — ‘<i>V’lavash hakohein</i>’ (<i>and the priest shall put on</i>) <i>his linen garment, and his linen breeches ‘yilbash’</i> (<i>he shall put</i>) <i>upon his flesh</i>]? It is to include the turban and the belt” [which the priest is also to put on for the removing of the ashes].<br>Now Onkelos translated the word <i>mido</i> as <i>levushin</i> [“garments” — as opposed to Rashi’s interpretation, according to which it refers only to one garment, the tunic]. It would appear then that according to Onkelos, the word <i>mido</i> is a term which includes all of the priest’s garments, as if the verse were stating, “and the priest shall put on linen garments.” Similarly we are to understand the expressions: ‘<i>madav</i>’ (<i>his clothes</i>) <i>rent;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 4:12.</i> <i>that cometh down upon the collar ‘midothav’</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 133:2.</i> which means upon the edge of his garments; <i>girded with ‘mido’</i> (<i>his apparel</i>) <i>of war</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 20:8.</i> which means his garments. This then will be in accordance with the opinion of the Sage who says<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Dosa (Yoma 12 b). See Ramban in <i>Seder Pekudei</i> (Exodus 39:28, Vol. II, p. 614).</i> that the belt of the common priest was unlike the belt of the High Priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The belt of the High Priest was made of blue, purple, scarlet [all wool] and twined linen. This is expressly stated in the Torah. The question appears as to how the belt for the common priests was made. Rabbi Dosa is of the opinion that it was made only of linen; Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi differs, holding that it was like that of the High Priest. Now since Onkelos, as explained by Ramban, explains the word <i>mido</i> as an inclusive term for “all” the priest’s garments, and the verse states, <i>and the priest shall put on ‘mido’</i> (<i>his ‘garments’ of</i>) <i>linen</i>, Onkelos accordingly must agree with Rabbi Dosa that the belt of the common priest was unlike that of the High Priest, as the belt of the common priest was only of linen. Hence it states that the common priest shall put on <i>all</i> his garments of linen which includes the belt.</i>

Verse 4

AND HE SHALL PUT OFF HIS GARMENTS, [AND PUT ON OTHER GARMENTS, AND CARRY FORTH THE ASHES WITHOUT THE CAMP UNTO A CLEAN PLACE].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The subject-matter of this verse [4] should be clearly distinguished from that of the preceding verse. In Verse 3 the Torah commanded the priests to remove the ashes daily from the altar. This involved the priest’s taking a silver pan and going up to the top of the altar, and afterwards “he cleared away the cinders on either side and he scooped up the ashes in the center. He then descended, and when he reached the pavement he turned his face to the north and went along the east side of the ascent for about ten cubits, and then made a heap of the cinders on the pavement three handbreadths away from the ascent” (Tamid 28 b). This process of course did not remove <i>all</i> the ashes from upon the altar. This was done from time to time when there was a need for it, when so much accumulated that there was no more room on the woodpile. Then it was removed to a place outside the camp or Jerusalem. It is this latter subject which is the theme of the present verse.</i> “This was not compulsory for him to do so, but it would be a matter of propriety, so that he should not soil the garments in which he regularly ministers at the altar, by the removal of the ashes to a place without the camp. Garments worn when boiling the pot for one’s master, one should not wear when pouring out a glass of wine for him. That is why He said, <i>and he shall put on other garments</i> — of [a quality] inferior [to those in which he ministers at the altar].” This is Rashi’s language. Now the intent of our Rabbis in this remark was to state that the taking of the ashes [to a place outside the camp] must be done with the priests wearing the priestly garments, and thus the <i>other garments</i> [mentioned in the verse] are not ordinary clothes. Thus I do not know the source for that which the Rabbi [Rashi] said, that “it was not compulsory” [that he remove the garments in which he performs the regular Divine Service, and put on other garments when taking out the ashes to a place outside the camp]. For it would appear that it is a positive commandment to the priest, that the garments in which he performs the acts of offering, including the [daily] lifting up of the ashes, be clean ones, and that he must not perform the regular Divine Service with those garments in which he takes the ashes [outside the camp]. This commandment [of the changing of the garments] is of the nature of a servant’s etiquette towards his master. Therefore the priests should have more expensive garments for performing the acts of offering, and ones of inferior quality for removing the ashes [to a place outside the camp or city of Jerusalem].<br>All this is in accordance with this reasoning which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote [i.e., that the removal of the ashes must be done in priestly garments].

Verse 7

AND THIS IS THE LAW OF THE MEAL-OFFERING. This section, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, adds [to Chapter 2 above where the law of the meal-offering was discussed] four commandments about the meal-offering: that [the residue be] eaten unleavened, that it be eaten <i>in the Court of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9.</i> that <i>every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> and that whatever touches it becomes holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">“So that it becomes exactly like the meal-offering — that if it had become disqualified to be eaten, the food which touched it is also disqualified. And if the meal-offering was fit to be eaten, the other food must also be eaten under the same stringency as the meal-offering” (Rashi, Verse 11).</i><br>Now according to the Rabbinical interpretation thereof, there are many new teachings added [in this section, among them being the following]: that even of a meal-offering brought by priests the handful is taken out [and burnt on the altar, in the same way as the residue which must be burnt on the altar];<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If a meal-offering is brought by a non-priest, a handful of it is taken off by a priest and burnt on the altar, while the residue is eaten by the priests. Now the Torah specifies, however, that if the meal-offering is brought by a priest, it is to be <i>wholly</i> burnt (further, Verse 16). The question appears: is it necessary that a handful thereof be taken by a priest and be burnt separately on the altar, or that the whole meal-offering should be burnt at the same time as a unit? According to the text in Ramban before us, the answer is clearly in the affirmative. Scholars, however, have pointed to the Talmud (in Menachoth 72 b) where the conclusion is contrary to this text. The suggestion has therefore been made that the text here is faulty, and should be emended to read: “that even a meal-offering of priests requires ‘oil and frankincense’” (mentioned in Verse 8). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 29.</i> that the priest must bring it near <i>before the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 7 before us.</i> which means to the western corner [of the altar, since the Tent of Meeting where the ark of the covenant stood, was to the west of the altar, and therefore nearest to it], and <i>in front of the altar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 7 before us.</i> which means to the southern corner [since the ramp of the altar which is its “front,” was on the south side thereof]. Thus you find that it had to be “presented” [i.e., brought near] to the southwestern corner of the altar. [And this section further teaches:] <i>And he shall take up from it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> a handful — “from it” as one joined mass, meaning that he is not to bring one tenth of an ephah of flour [which is the amount brought for a meal-offering] in two receptacles [but it must be a full tenth of an ephah in one receptacle], nor is he to make a fixed measure that holds as much as his handful [to remove the amount of flour for the altar, but he must do it with his hand]. He also states, <i>It shall not be baked as anything leavened</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10.</i> This is to liken all the stages of work [in the preparation of the meal-offering] to baking, thus teaching that one is also liable for kneading and rolling it if it be leavened, and that for each and every such act he transgresses a negative commandment and is liable to whipping on each count.

Verse 10

I HAVE GIVEN IT AS THEIR PORTION OF MY OFFERINGS. Even to apportion it [i.e., the residue of the meal-offering which the priests are to eat] they are not permitted to do until after the parts given to the fire [i.e., the handful] have gone up on the altar. It is from here that we learn that the same law applies to all hallowed offerings, as it is written, <i>I have given it as their portion of My offerings; it is most holy</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The verse thus says that the reason, why the priests are not permitted even to apportion the residue of the meal-offering amongst themselves until the altar’s share has gone up as a fire offering, is because the meal-offering is most holy, therefore it follows that the same principle applies to all offerings, since they are all holy.</i><br><i>It shall not be baked as anything leavened. Their portion</i> …<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text reads: <i>lo thei’apheh chametz chelkam</i> … The juxtaposition of the word <i>chelkam</i> (their portion) to the word <i>chametz</i> (leavened) is the reason for the Rabbis’ interpretation that the portion the priests receive from the meal-offering, neither may be baked with leaven.</i> — even the residue [which the priests receive as their share of the meal-offering] may not be baked with leaven. <i>As the sin-offering, and as the guilt-offering</i> — this teaches that just as the sin-offering must come from ordinary money,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">One who is required to bring a sin-offering because of a transgression committed, cannot use sacred money [such as money of the Second Tithe, and the like]; but he must take some of his ordinary money and buy the offering with it. This principle is derived from the verse, <i>And Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin-offering ‘which is his’</i> (further, 16:6), that is, from the money which belongs to him. Sacred money, on the other hand, is not completely his to dispose of as he wishes.</i> and can be offered only at daytime, and the priest performs all its acts with his right arm — so also this meal-offering must come from ordinary money, and be brought at daytime, and its acts must be performed with the priest’s right hand. <i>Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> — it may be apportioned even amongst those priests who have a bodily blemish [such as are mentioned further in Chapter 21:16-21 as disqualifying them from performing the acts of offering, but they may eat the residue of the meal-offering].<br>Now with regards to the meal-offering of the priests He added [this command]: <i>And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt; it shall not be eaten</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16.</i> On this the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed III, 46.</i> that the reason [for the meal-offering of the priest being entirely burnt] is because every priest offered up his own meal-offering himself, and if he were to offer it and eat the residue of it himself, it would appear as if he had brought no offering. For nothing was offered of an ordinary individual’s meal-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The meal-offerings which accompanied the Daily and Additional Offerings brought in the name of all Israel, were wholly burnt on the altar (Menachoth 73 b). Hence Rambam speaks of the <i>minchath yachid</i> (the meal-offering of the individual).</i> except the frankincense and the handful of the flour. If then, in addition to the fact that the whole offering was small, he who offered it were to eat it himself, he would imagine<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>V’yidmeh</i> (and he will imagine).” Such is the text in Al Charizi’s translation of the Moreh Nebuchim, which Ramban follows. The intent would seem to be that the priest who is offering his own meal-offering will imagine that he has performed no Divine Service, and therefore he might violate the laws regarding the eating of the residue. Hence the Torah prohibited him from eating it. In Ibn Tibbon’s translation, however, the reading is: “<i>V’lo yeira’eh</i> (and it will not appear),” that is, to others, that a Service has been performed, and therefore they will hold the priest in disregard for eating it. That is why the Torah commanded that it be wholly burnt.</i> that he had brought no offering at all. Therefore [the Torah required] that it be entirely burnt.

THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SIN-OFFERING. In <i>Seder Vayikra</i> He commanded concerning [the offerings in the following order]: the burnt-offering, the meal-offering, the peace-offerings, the sin-offering and the guilt-offering, [the reason for this order being] that at first He spoke about the freewill offerings [namely the burnt-offering, the meal-offering and the peace-offerings], and afterwards He mentioned those offerings which are obligatory upon the sinner. Here, however, [in <i>Seder Tzav</i>] the explanation is given first in connection with the burnt-offering and meal-offering, and only then about the sin-offering and guilt-offering, because He wished to explain the laws of the most holy offerings [in one group], since there is one law for them all, as He said [above in Verse 10] with reference to the meal-offering, <i>it is most holy, as the sin-offering and the guilt-offering</i>, and only afterwards He explains the law of those offerings which are less holy [namely, the peace-offerings].<br>Now in this section [dealing with the sin-offering] He added many new laws. [The verse] <i>This is the law of the sin-offering</i> teaches that there is one law for all sin-offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See Note 16 above, that the term <i>torah</i> or <i>torath</i> (“law” or “law of”) at the beginning of a section, denotes inclusion, while <i>hi</i> denotes exclusion. So also the word <i>zoth</i> (this), as it says here in this case, <i>zoth torath</i> … (<i>this is the law of</i> …), means exclusion.</i> meaning that even the blood of “the inner sin-offerings”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Sin-offerings were of two kinds: (a) those whose blood was sprinkled on the outer altar, and are therefore referred to as the “outer sin-offerings.” These included most of the sin-offerings. After the sprinkling of the blood and the burning of the fats, the meat was eaten by the priests, (b) The second group was called “the inner sin offerings,” because their blood was taken into the interior of the Sanctuary to be sprinkled in front of the Veil overhanging the Holy of Holies, as well as on the golden altar (see above, 4:6-7; 17-18), and on the Day of Atonement also in front of the ark (further, 16:14-15). These sin-offerings were wholly burnt outside the camp [and later, after the Sanctuary was built, they were burnt outside the city of Jerusalem]. — Now here in Verse 20 Scripture states the law regarding “the <i>outer</i> sin-offerings,” that if any of their blood was sprinkled upon a garment, the garment must be washed in a holy place [i.e., in the Court of the Sanctuary], But it does not say this law with regard to “the inner sin-offerings.” Since the section, however, begins with the expression [<i>zoth</i>] <i>‘torath’ hachatath</i> (<i>this is ‘the law’ of the sin-offering</i>), and the word <i>torath</i> denotes inclusion, we know that the same law applies to both kinds of sin-offering.</i> [if sprinkled upon a garment] must be washed off [<i>in a holy place</i>]. I might think that this applies also to a sin-offering brought from a bird, Scripture therefore says <i>zoth</i> [<i>‘zoth’ torath hachatath</i> (<i>‘this’ is the law of the sin-offering</i>) — and the word <i>zoth</i> denotes exclusion]. He also states here [in the verse before us], <i>in the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered shall the sin-offering be slaughtered before the Eternal</i>, thus indicating that all sin-offerings must be slaughtered only on the northern side of the altar, since in the section of <i>Vayikra</i> this was stated only with reference to the sin-offering of the prince<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 4:24.</i> and of the individual;<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 29, 33.</i> therefore here [in this section] they are all included — the sin-offerings of the public and “the inner sin-offerings.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Sin-offerings were of two kinds: (a) those whose blood was sprinkled on the outer altar, and are therefore referred to as the “outer sin-offerings.” These included most of the sin-offerings.

Only once a year, namely, on the Festival of Shevuoth, were peace-offerings brought by the public (see further, 23:19). These were considered among “the most holy offerings.” Offerings which were most holy were slaughtered on the north side of the altar, and could be eaten only by male priests, within the Court of the Sanctuary, during the same day and night; those that were holy to a lesser degree were slaughtered in any part of the Court, and could be eaten by any person, within the enclosed city of Jerusalem, for two days and the intervening night. The thanks-offering and the Nazirite’s ram, though holy to a lesser degree, could be eaten only the same day and the ensuing night.</i> teaching that they may only be slaughtered on the northern side of the altar, as all offerings of the most holy degree are required to be slaughtered on the northern side. <i>Hi</i> (this) — <i>‘this’ is the law of the sin-offering</i>, comes to exclude the thanks-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 7:12.

He further commanded here to give the meat of the sin-offerings to the sons of Aaron<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> — that is, to the males and not the daughters of Aaron — and commanded them to eat it <i>within the Court of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i> In addition He mentioned [in this section] many new laws concerning absorption [of the taste of] the sin-offerings [by the vessels in which they are boiled].<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i>

Verse 19



Verse 20

THOU SHALT WASH IT IN A HOLY PLACE.

In the Sanctuary at Jerusalem it was surrounded by a wall.

He states, <i>and the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> This too is to be broken in the holy place [i.e., within the Court], and the pieces of pottery are swallowed up in the place [where they are broken],<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 21 a.

AND EVERY SIN-OFFERING, WHEREOF ANY OF THE BLOOD IS BROUGHT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING etc. “This means that if the priest brought any of the blood of ‘an outer sin-offering’<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Sin-offerings were of two kinds: (a) those whose blood was sprinkled on the outer altar, and are therefore referred to as the “outer sin-offerings.” These included most of the sin-offerings.

These sin-offerings were wholly burnt outside the camp [and later, after the Sanctuary was built, they were burnt outside the city of Jerusalem]. — Now here in Verse 20 Scripture states the law regarding “the <i>outer</i> sin-offerings,” that if any of their blood was sprinkled upon a garment, the garment must be washed in a holy place [i.e., in the Court of the Sanctuary], But it does not say this law with regard to “the inner sin-offerings.” Since the section, however, begins with the expression [<i>zoth</i>] <i>‘torath’ hachatath</i> (<i>this is ‘the law’ of the sin-offering</i>), and the word <i>torath</i> denotes inclusion, we know that the same law applies to both kinds of sin-offering.</i> into the interior of the Sanctuary it becomes invalidated, [and the offering may not be eaten, and must be burnt].” Thus the language of Rashi. According to this opinion, the phrase <i>to atone in the holy place</i> which Scripture says [in continuation], is not to be understood in its simple sense, since this blood does not [in fact] bring atonement, for it became invalidated as soon as it was brought into the Sanctuary, and it is on account of that very invalidation that it is to be burnt. Rather, the expression <i>to atone</i> means [according to Rashi] that if he brought it into the interior “with the intent to atone,” [namely] to sprinkle there of its blood as is done with the blood of “the inner sin-offerings,”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Sin-offerings were of two kinds: (a) those whose blood was sprinkled on the outer altar, and are therefore referred to as the “outer sin-offerings.” These included most of the sin-offerings.

These sin-offerings were wholly burnt outside the camp [and later, after the Sanctuary was built, they were burnt outside the city of Jerusalem]. — Now here in Verse 20 Scripture states the law regarding “the <i>outer</i> sin-offerings,” that if any of their blood was sprinkled upon a garment, the garment must be washed in a holy place [i.e., in the Court of the Sanctuary], But it does not say this law with regard to “the inner sin-offerings.” Since the section, however, begins with the expression [<i>zoth</i>] <i>‘torath’ hachatath</i> (<i>this is ‘the law’ of the sin-offering</i>), and the word <i>torath</i> denotes inclusion, we know that the same law applies to both kinds of sin-offering.</i> even though he has not [in fact] atoned with it, meaning that he has not sprinkled any of its blood, it is nonetheless invalidated from the moment of entry, and [the offering] is to be burnt. It is possible according to this that if he brought it in with the intent of not sprinkling thereof at all [in the Sanctuary], that the offering remains valid. According to the words of Rabbi Shimon,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 83 a.</i> it only becomes invalidated if he “atoned” with the blood, meaning that he actually sprinkled thereof in the same manner as is done in the case of “the inner sin-offerings” [i.e., in front of the Veil and on the comers of the golden altar].<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 4:6-7.</i> It is for this reason that Scripture states <i>to atone</i> — not [meaning] that he actually effected atonement, but that he brought of its blood to atone with it, and, according to his thinking, effected atonement. The meaning of the term “into the interior” [which Rashi mentioned above] is “into the Sanctuary.” The same [is also the meaning of the phrase] “if he brought into the ‘interior of the interior’ [i.e., the Holy of Holies]” of the bullock of the anointed priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-7.</i> or that of “forgetting a matter of law,”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 13-18.</i> or of the goats brought for worshipping the idols,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:24.</i> namely that if he brought their blood into a more interior place than that designated for them, [since in these cases of sin-offering the blood is to be brought into the Sanctuary proper to effect atonement], then the offerings become invalidated. Scripture states <i>‘of’ the blood</i> in order to indicate that even bringing in part of the blood invalidates the offering. Thus if the priest received the blood in two cups, and brought only one of them into the interior, the offering is invalidated.<br>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Thus far we have followed the interpretation of Rashi which is based upon sources in the Talmud, which was as follows: “<i>and every</i> outer <i>sin-offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the holy place</i>, according to the priest’s intent which was not, however, in accordance with the law — since the blood of an outer sin-offering is to be sprinkled upon the outer altar — that offering <i>shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire</i>.” Ramban is now to suggest a totally different interpretation, namely, that the verse is not speaking of <i>outer</i> sin-offerings wrongly brought in, but establishes the principle that all “<i>inner</i> sin-offerings” [as enumerated in the text: “the bullock of the anointed priest etc.”] the blood of which <i>is</i> regularly brought into the interior, are not to be eaten by the priests, unlike that of “the outer sin-offerings,” whose meat is eaten by the priests (see Note 52 above). Ramban will conclude by saying that this is the interpretation of one of the Sages in the Torath Kohanim and Talmud.</i> the verse speaks only with reference to “the inner sin-offerings,” concerning the burning of which He had already commanded,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 4:12, 21.</i> and here Scripture came to add a negative commandment against eating them,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The command in Chapter 4 is a positive one; Ramban is saying that the verse here adds to this a negative command, not to eat of the flesh, in addition to the positive one to burn it. There is thus an additional penalty for one who eats of it.</i> for this section is intended to complete the laws of sin-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban means to say that although Verses 17-22 clearly speak of <i>outer</i> sin-offerings [which are eaten], Scripture wished to complete here all laws pertaining to all sin-offerings, and thus we may interpret Verse 23 as indeed referring to <i>inner</i> sin-offerings (see note 68 above).</i> This is the interpretation of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 8:5.</i> and in Tractate Zebachim.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 82 a.</i>

AND THE PRIEST THAT OFFERETH ANY MAN’S BURNT-OFFERING, EVEN THE PRIEST SHALL HAVE TO HIMSELF THE SKIN OF THE BURNT-OFFERING. This law applies to all offerings, and although Scripture mentions only the burnt-offering, it holds good of the sin-offering and guilt-offering mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 1 (the guilt-offering) and 6:18 (the sin-offering).</i> Such is not the case, however, in reference to the peace-offerings [the skin of which belongs to the owner]; therefore Scripture mentioned the law of the priests’ due in the middle of the offerings, before it speaks of the peace-offerings [further on in Verses 11-21].<br>The interpretation of the Rabbis as found in the Torath Kohanim is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 9:2.</i> “[From the verse here] I know only that the skin of the burnt-offering [belongs to the priest]. Whence do I know that the same law applies to the skins of [the other] most holy offerings? Scripture therefore says, <i>that offereth</i>. Or perhaps I might think that I am to include [also] the skins of the offerings which are holy to a lesser degree [such as the peace-offering etc.]; Scripture therefore says, <i>burnt-offering</i>, thus teaching that just as the burnt-offering is distinguished by being of the most holy degree of offerings, [so also this law holds good of all most holy offerings], thus excluding those which are holy in a minor degree.”<br>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, it was not necessary to state this law [that the skin of the animal belongs to the priest] in connection with the sin-offering and guilt-offering, since they are part of the gifts given to the priests,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:9.</i> and the priests thus are entitled to the meat and also the skin, but in the case of the burnt-offering [where the priests do not receive any of the meat, since it is wholly burnt on the altar], it was necessary for Scripture to say that they do acquire the skin. This is the interpretation of Rabbi [Yehuda Hanasi] who says,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 103 b.</i> “Essentially we need this verse only for the skin of the burnt-offering [to teach that it belongs to the priest], since the skin always follows the meat”<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">“The bullocks which are burnt and the he-goats which are burnt [outside the camp], their skins are burnt with them, as it is said, <i>and they shall burn in fire their skins, and their flesh</i> (further, 16:27) (Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 9:5). Hence the Torah had to explain that the burnt-offering is different; but in the case of the sin-offering and the guilt-offering, it was not necessary to mention that the skin belongs to the priest, for since he acquired the right to the meat, the skin naturally came with it.</i> [and here Scripture tells us that it is not to be burnt with the meat]. So also is it explained in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">“The bullocks which are burnt and the he-goats which are burnt [outside the camp], their skins are burnt with them, as it is said, <i>and they shall burn in fire their skins, and their flesh</i> (further, 16:27) (Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 9:5). Hence the Torah had to explain that the burnt-offering is different; but in the case of the sin-offering and the guilt-offering, it was not necessary to mention that the skin belongs to the priest, for since he acquired the right to the meat, the skin naturally came with it.</i>

Verse 9

AND EVERY MEAL-OFFERING THAT IS BAKED IN THE OVEN, [AND EVERYTHING MADE IN THE BOILING POT, AND IN THE PAN, SHALL BE THE PRIESTS THAT OFFERETH IT]. The simple explanation of this verse is apparent, namely that He is commanding here that if one vows to bring one of the three kinds of meal-offering — the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan — that they should all be given exclusively to the priest who offered them. Then He states concerning all the other meal-offerings, — such as if a person vowed to bring a meal-offering without specification of which kind, in which case he brings it of fine flour, and the meal-offering of first-fruits,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 2:14-16.</i> which are both mixed with oil; and the meal-offering of the sinner<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:11-14.</i> and of the suspected adulteress<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 5:15.</i> which are dry [without oil and without frankincense] — that they should be divided <i>among all the sons of Aaron</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10.</i> that is to say, among all priests of their Father’s House.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The priests were divided into twenty-four groups. Each group came by turn to the Sanctuary for one week’s service. These groups were in turn subdivided into Fathers’ Houses, each House ministering for one day out of the seven. On the festivals all the groups shared equally in the Service. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 46-47.</i> The meaning of the expression, <i>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</i> — is that a meal-offering which is of fine flour only, whether it be mixed with oil or dry, which is not one of these [three] mentioned above [the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan — belongs to all priests who were ministering on that day, and not exclusively to the priests who offered them]. The reason for the difference between them is because [in the case of the three meal-offerings mentioned above] the priest took pains in baking them, and therefore he deserves to be given a greater reward. [All this is in accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture].<br>Our Rabbis, however, did not want to explain the verses in this way because Scripture said, <i>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil or dry</i>, which includes <i>all</i> possible meal-offerings, since they are all either mingled with oil or dry. Therefore the Rabbis understood the expression <i>it shall be the priest’s that offereth it</i> [mentioned here in Verse 9 in connection with the three meal-offerings: the one baked in the oven, etc.] as meaning that it shall belong to all pure priests who are present there. Similarly, when He said, <i>And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt-offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8 — stating that the skin of the burnt-offering belongs to the priest who offered it.</i> and <i>the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7 — stating that the meat of the sin-offering and guilt-offering belong to the priest that made the atonement.</i> these verses are only intended to say that they do not belong to the owners who brought them, but that in reward for offering them they belong to the pure priests who are present there, for all of them are engaged in offering them, whether physically or by command, since any individual priest or two or three of them who offered up [the particular offering], did so with the permission of all of them and acting as their deputy, and all of them would stand by the offering. <i>As is the share of him that goeth down to the battle, so shall be the share of him that tarrieth by the baggage; they shall share alike</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 30:24.</i> After He had said [in general terms] that they shall belong to the priests as a reward for their service, He explained it again in detail: <i>and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10.</i> which includes all meal-offerings, <i>shall all the sons of Aaron have</i>, meaning all the officiating priests mentioned [in the preceding verses], <i>one as well as another</i>, that is to say, all clean priests of the Father’s House,<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The priests were divided into twenty-four groups. Each group came by turn to the Sanctuary for one week’s service. These groups were in turn subdivided into Fathers’ Houses, each House ministering for one day out of the seven. On the festivals all the groups shared equally in the Service. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 46-47.</i> as they are all the officiating priests mentioned previously. Thus Scripture [first] mentioned the meal-offerings by their individual names — the one baked in the oven, or made in the boiling pot, or in the pan — and then mentioned them all again in a general rule, saying [that they belong to all the priests], <i>one as well as another</i>, meaning that one priest should only have [of the kind of meal-offering] that the other priest has, [and they cannot give one priest his share of one kind of meal-offering, and the others a share of another kind]. Even if the meal-offering was of fine flour, each is to be given his share from that offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is as follows. In the case of the three meal-offerings which are baked [i.e., the one baked in the oven, made in the boiling pot, and in the pan], even if the priest receives only a small part thereof, he can eat it readily. But in the case of the meal-offering of fine flour, if the share is small he will not be benefitted much by it. One might therefore think that he can receive his share from another kind of meal-offering, hence the law states that the apportionment must be only in that one kind.</i> Scripture thus states that this law applies to meal-offerings, and all the more so to the other offerings, which are of greater monetary value. It is tradition which decides [in favor of the Rabbis’ interpretation mentioned above],<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, even though the literal interpretation of the verses indicates that the three baked meal-offerings should all belong exclusively to the priest who was actively engaged in offering them, yet it is tradition which is the deciding factor that the Rabbis’ analysis of the verses, as explained above, is correct.</i> and it is furthermore for the benefit of [all] the priests and conducive to peace in the Sanctuary.<br>It is possible that the interpretation of the verses according to this opinion of the Rabbis is as follows: “<i>And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and everything made in the boiling pot, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it; and every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry</i> shall [also] be so, and <i>all the sons of Aaron shall have it, one as well as another</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation indicates clearly that <i>all</i> meal-offerings are mentioned alike in Scripture with respect to the share of all ministering priests on that day.</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

THEN HE SHALL OFFER ‘AL’ THE OFFERING OF THANKSGIVING. The commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">So explained by Ibn Ezra.</i> have explained the word <i>al</i> as meaning “with” — <i>with the offering of thanksgiving</i>. Similarly, <i>‘al’ the cakes of leavened bread</i><sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> means “with them.” The correct interpretation appears to me that the word <i>al</i> is here to be understood in its ordinary sense [i.e., “upon”], meaning that he should add bread “upon” the offering. Similarly, <i>‘al’ the cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> means that he is to bring cakes of leavened bread, and adding “upon” them he is to bring <i>his offering</i>, which is the unleavened bread mentioned [in Verse 12 before us] — all these breads [thirty unleavened cakes and ten leavened ones] he is to bring <i>upon the offering</i> [of thanksgiving]. Scripture thus made the leavened bread the chief part of the offering, “adding” upon it the rest of the bread [i.e., the unleavened bread, by stating “upon the cakes of leavened bread he shall present <i>his offering,”</i> which means “his unleavened bread”], because the unleavened breads are more than all the other kinds.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Flour comprising twenty tenths of an ephah (see Note 95) was divided equally for the baking of the unleavened and leavened breads. The unleavened breads were of three kinds [cakes, wafers, and cakes of flour saturated with oil — as mentioned in Verse 12] each consisting of ten, thus making thirty unleavened breads. The leavened breads were ten. Thus while fewer in number, the leavened breads were yet larger, since the same amount of flour was used for the total amount of unleavened breads — thirty — as for the ten leavened breads. Of these four kinds of breads, one of each was given to the priest and the rest were eaten by the owner of the offering and his family.</i> Scripture changed the expression, stating, [<i>he shall present his offering</i>] <i>of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving</i><sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> [while here in Verse 12 it merely says, <i>the offering of thanksgiving</i>], in order to allude to the Rabbis’ interpretation regarding it, namely that the bread does not become holy in itself [in the sense that it cannot be redeemed, or that it becomes invalid if carried outside the wall of the city, etc.] until the offering is slaughtered, and [also] that it should be slaughtered “upon” it [the bread], that is to say, with the intention that the bread should become holy with it [the offering].<br>Now Rashi wrote: “<i>Then he shall bring with the offering of thanksgiving</i> four sorts of bread: cakes, wafers, and cakes mingled with oil — these three kinds being of unleavened bread. And it further states, <i>with cakes of leavened bread</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> [thus making four kinds], and each kind consisted of ten cakes. Thus it is explained in Tractate Menachoth.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 77 a.</i> And their total measure was five Jerusalem seahs, which are six measures according to the Wilderness measure,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">The Jerusalem measure was one sixth larger than that of the wilderness. Hence six seahs of Wilderness measure made five seahs of Jerusalem measure.</i> or twenty tenths [of the ephah].”<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">An ephah is three seahs. Six seahs thus make two ephahs. Since in each ephah there are ten tenths [of the ephah], the two ephahs [comprising the six seahs] make twenty tenths of the ephah.</i> Now the Rabbi [Rashi] did not mention in connection with these twenty tenths [of flour] that ten of them were for the leavened cakes, a tenth for each one, and the other ten tenths for the unleavened ones, thus making three unleavened cakes to each tenth of flour.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">There were three kinds of unleavened cake, each consisting of ten cakes, thus totaling thirty. Thus since thirty cakes were made out of the total of ten tenths of an ephah, it follows that three cakes were made out of each tenth.</i> The Rabbis interpreted that this is so on the basis of the verse, <i>‘al’ cakes of leavened bread</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> [which they explained<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 77 a.</i> as meaning]: “‘Corresponding to’ [the amount of flour used in the preparation of the ten] leavened cakes, use the same amount to bring therefrom [the thirty] unleavened cakes. Thus there were twenty tenths [of an ephah of flour], ten for the leavened cakes and ten for the unleavened. Ten tenths were used for the leavened ones, thus making one tenth of flour for each of [the ten] leavened cakes, and ten tenths for the unleavened ones, thus making three cakes to one tenth of flour. Thus there were forty cakes altogether.”

Verse 13



Verse 14

AND OF IT HE SHALL PRESENT ONE OUT OF EACH OFFERING — one whole cake [for <i>a heave-offering unto the Eternal</i>]. Thus he takes as a heave-offering four cakes [and gives them to the priest].<br>But I wonder! When Scripture excluded [first-fruits] from the prohibition against burning leaven [on the altar],<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 2:11.</i> by stating, <i>as an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 12.</i> [which means that “the two loaves” of the Festival of Shevuoth were to be brought of leavened dough, as clearly mentioned further on in Scripture],<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:17.</i> why did it not say that [the ten leavened cakes of] the thanks-offering [are also an exception]? But this is not really a question. For Scripture states, <i>and unto the altar they</i> [i.e., leaven and honey] <i>shall not come up for a sweet savor</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 12.</i> and of the [forty] breads of the thanks-offering, none came up on the altar at all, for they require only waving.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">The Tur refutes this argument by pointing to the fact that nothing of “the two loaves” of the Festival of Shevuoth came up on the altar either; yet Scripture found it necessary to call attention to their being an exception to the prohibition against burning leaven on the altar, because of the offerings that came with the two loaves (see <i>ibid.</i>, Verse 18), and such is the case also with the thanks-offering. So the question recurs: Why did Scripture not call attention to the exception of the breads of the thanks-offering? The Tur answers that Scripture called attention only to an obligatory offering, such being the case of “the two loaves” on the Festival of Shevuoth, but not to a thanks-offering, which is a freewill offering. See further my Hebrew commentary pp. 33-34.</i> Even though in the case of the showbread<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Twelve loaves were put on the golden table in the Sanctuary every Sabbath, with two spoons of frankincense beside them. On the following Sabbath the frankincense was burnt on the altar and the loaves were divided among the priests. None of the bread was offered on the altar.</i> He did say that one commits a transgression if one brought it in a leaven state<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">“ ‘<i>Kol</i>’ (<i>any</i>) <i>meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto the Eternal, shall not be made with leaven</i> (above, 2:11), the word <i>kol</i> includes the showbread, that it too must not be leavened” (Menachoth 57 a).</i> [although there too none of the loaves are burnt on the altar], that is because of the frankincense that was on it which was <i>to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 24:7.</i> But of the bread of the thanks-offering, nothing at all came up on the altar [hence the Torah permitted the ten loaves to be leavened]. Perhaps Scripture only had to mention that exception [<i>as an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 12.</i> because of the honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">And not because of the leaven, as we have understood it till now.</i> since it was not clearly stated concerning the first-fruits [which were brought of “the seven kinds”]<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the seven kinds of products for which the Land of Israel was famed: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olive-oil, and [date] honey. See my translation of “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 133-134.</i> that they may be brought from honey [and it therefore had to be explicitly stated in that verse], and thus He also included leaven with it, saying of both of them, <i>as an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 12.</i> With reference to leaven, however, since it is clearly explained in its correct place [that the “two loaves” of the Festival of Shevuoth constitute an exception to the usual negative commandment], there was no need any more to mention it as an exception [when mentioning the general negative commandment], just as Scripture has not specified the exception to the rule about the Sabbath, when stating <i>every one that profaneth it shall be put to death</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 31:14.</i> [by saying] “except for the Service of the offerings” [which may be done on the Sabbath], or in the case of <i>thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 18:16.</i> [by saying] “except for a brother’s childless wife” [whom he is to marry].<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 25:5.

Verse 15

AND THE FLESH OF THE OFFERING OF HIS PEACE-OFFERINGS FOR THANKSGIVING SHALL BE EATEN ON THE DAY OF HIS OFFERING. “There are here many terms of amplification [all the seemingly redundant words thus being intended to widen the scope of the law]. Thus they include in this law the sin-offering and guilt-offering, the Nazirite’s ram,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:14. The Nazirite’s ram was a peace-offering (<i>ibid.</i>) and a peace-offering may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night.

Now this Festal-offering was really a peace-offering, and hence it ought to be eaten for two days and the one intervening night. But according to Rashi it is here included in the law of the thanks-offering, to be eaten only for one day and a night. Ramban further on will differ with this opinion of Rashi, and hold that it has the usual law of peace-offerings.</i> that they may all be eaten for a day and a night.” This is Rashi’s language. But it is not correct, for the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night, like the rest of the peace-offerings. So also we have been taught in Tractate Pesachim:<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Pesachim 71 b.</i> “<i>Neither shall any of the flesh, which thou offerest on the first day at even, remain all night until the morning</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:4.</i> Scripture speaks here of the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan, teaching that it may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night,<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">The explanation of the verse (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>) is thus as follows: “<i>Neither shall any of the flesh which thou offerest at even</i> [i.e., towards eventide on the fourteenth of Nisan] <i>remain on the first day</i> [of the festival, i.e., the fifteenth day of Nisan] <i>all night until the morning</i> of the sixteenth,” but it may be eaten only on the fourteenth and fifteenth days and the one intervening night.</i> and when Scripture states <i>on the first day … until the morning</i>, it means the second morning.”<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">For since the expression “on the first day” means that it may be eaten the whole of the first day of the festival, the term <i>laboker</i> (<i>until the morning</i>) must perforce refer to the morning of the second day.</i> Rashi himself wrote this in the <i>Seder R’eih Anochi</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:4.</i> Here, however, the Rabbi [Rashi] follows the words of Ben Teima,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Pesachim 71 b.</i> who says that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth of Nisan which comes with the Passover-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">In order that the Passover-offering be eaten after one has satisfied one’s hunger, a Festal-offering was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of Nisan which was eaten on the night of the fifteenth [i.e., the first night of Passover], before the Passover-offering was eaten.

But according to Ben Teima, these amplifications [referred to by Rashi] only come to indicate that it [the Festal-offering accompanying the Passover-offering] is like the Passover-offering in every respect, coming only from the sheep, a male of the first year,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:5. A peace-offering, on the other hand, can be brought of the cattle, male or female, regardless of the age (above, 3:1).</i> since it is written, <i>Neither shall the offering of the feast of the Passover be left unto the morning</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:25.</i> [which Ben Teima interpreted to mean: “<i>the offering of the feast</i>, namely the Festal-offering; <i>of the Passover</i>, namely the Passover-offering,” the same law thus applying to both], as it is stated there.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Pesachim 70 a. Ben Teima thus interprets the verse to refer to two separate offerings, and derives the law that they are both to be eaten within the same time not from the amplification of Verse 15 before us, but from the explicit statement in Exodus 34:25: <i>neither shall … be left unto the morning</i>.</i><br>But that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote here [namely, that the terms of amplification of the verse teach that the Festal-offering is to be eaten only for a day and a night] is on the basis of a Beraitha<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 65.</i> taught in the Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 12:1.</i> which states as follows: “<i>And the flesh of the offering of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving, shall be eaten on the day of his offering</i>. This verse comes to teach that those offerings which Scripture states are to be eaten for one day [and the following night] may only be eaten during that time [and not for two days and the intervening night, as is the period assigned for the peace-offering]. I would only know that such is the law for the thanks-offering [i.e., the offering itself, which is mentioned explicitly in the verse]. Whence do I know to include the breads thereof? Scripture therefore says, <i>his offering</i>. Whence do I know to include the offspring of the thanks-offering and animals substituted for it in the same law? Scripture therefore says, <i>‘and’ the flesh</i>. Whence do I know to include the sin-offerings and guilt-offering [that they, too, may be eaten only during the day and the ensuing night]? Scripture therefore says, <i>the offering</i>. Whence do I know to include the Nazirite’s peace-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:14. The Nazirite’s ram was a peace-offering (<i>ibid.</i>) and a peace-offering may be eaten for two days and the one intervening night. Yet Scripture establishes here that the Nazirite’s ram is an exception, and may be eaten as a thanks-offering which is only for a day and night.</i> and the peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering? Scripture therefore says, <i>his peace-offerings</i>.”<br>This is the Beraitha<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 65.</i> [taught in the Torath Kohanim]. Now the Rabbi [Rashi] explained<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">In Zebachim 36 a.</i> the phrase “the peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering” as referring to the Festal-offering of the fourteenth day of Nisan, which comes together with the Passover-offering, [thus providing the authority for his comment here that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth of Nisan may be eaten only during the day and ensuing night.] Thus also I have found in Tractate Pesachim, in the Chapter <i>Mi Shehayah</i> (If any man shall be unclean),<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Pesachim 96 b.</i> that Rashi gave two explanations of this phrase — “the peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering” — and wrote [after explaining the first interpretation]: “Another explanation is that it means the Festal-offering of the fourteenth. This explanation I have heard.” Here then [in his commentary on the Torah] the Rabbi relied on the interpretation he had heard [and consequently he wrote that the Festal-offering of the fourteenth may be eaten only for one day and the following night].<br>But the matter is not so. [The correct explanation of the phrase] “peace-offerings which come on account of the Passover-offering,” is that it refers to [those animals] which remain over from the Passover-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">The term “remain over from the Passover-offering” includes besides the two cases mentioned in the text also the case if he set aside a certain sum of money for the buying of a Passover-offering, and not all the money was used up for that purpose, he must bring a peace-offering from the balance (Pesachim 70 b; Mishneh Torah <i>Hilchoth Korban Pesach</i> 4:10).</i> such as where the owners substituted another one for it, or where the owners of a Passover-offering fulfilled their duty<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads: “<i>shenithkapru</i> (that they were forgiven)” — a term borrowed from a sin-offering. But in the case of the Passover-offering the sense is that the owners had fulfilled their duty through another offering.</i> by bringing another offering. [In these cases they are to be eaten only for one day and the ensuing night], as since they were at the beginning only meant to be eaten for one day and the ensuing night, [namely the night following the day on which they were slaughtered, as is the law of all Passover-offerings], so also in the end [i.e., when they are offered up as peace-offerings they are to be eaten only for one day and the ensuing night]. But the Festal-offering of the fourteenth [since it is not originally brought as a Passover-offering], is eaten for two days [and the intervening night] in accordance with the words of the Sages. So also we have been taught in that very same Beraitha<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 12:1.</i> at the end thereof: “<i>And on the morrow</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16 here, referring to the peace-offering, which may be eaten on the day it was offered and the ensuing night, <i>and</i> also <i>on the morrow</i>.</i> This verse comes to teach that those offerings which [Scripture states] are to be eaten for two days [and the intervening night] may only be eaten during that time. I know only that this applies to the peace-offering [which is clearly mentioned in the verse]. Whence do I know to include the Festal-offering which comes at its proper time [i.e., the regular Festal-offering of the <i>fifteenth</i> day of Nisan]? etc. Now I know to include the Festal-offering which comes at its regular time. Whence do I know to include the Festal-offering which comes with the Passover-offering [that it may be eaten only for two days and the intervening night]? etc.” [Thus it is clearly stated that the Festal-offering of the <i>fourteenth</i> may be eaten for only two days and the intervening night, and not as Rashi wrote that it may be eaten only for one day and the following night].

Verse 16

AND ON THE MORROW ‘V’HANOTHAR’ (AND THAT WHICH REMAINETH) OF IT SHALL BE EATEN. “The letter <i>vav</i> [in the word <i>v’hanothar</i> — ‘and’ that which remaineth] is redundant [thus the meaning of the verse is: “and on the morrow, that which remaineth of it shall be eaten”]. There are many examples of this in Scripture, such as: <i>and these are the children of Zibeon: ‘v’ayah’</i> (<i>and Ajah</i>) <i>and Anah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 36:24. The <i>vav</i> in <i>v’ayah</i> (“and” Ajah) is redundant.

The <i>vav</i> in <i>v’kodesh</i> (“and” the Sanctuary) is here redundant.</i> This is Rashi’s language, and so did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpret the verse.<br>In my opinion the meaning of the verse is as follows: Since He said, <i>it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his offering, and on the morrow</i>, this might imply that it is a commandment that it [the peace-offering] be eaten in two days, [namely] that he should eat part of it on the first day, and should leave part of it to be eaten on the morrow. Therefore He explained again, <i>‘and’ that which remaineth</i> is to be eaten on the first day and also on the morrow [if by chance it was not all eaten on the first day]. But he is not to leave some over intentionally, nor is he permitted to leave it all over to be eaten on the second day. Rather, it is a commandment that he should eat it on the first day, and that which is left over by chance, should be eaten on the morrow previously mentioned.<br>This matter we have learned from the words of our Rabbis, who have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav</i> 12:11-12.</i> “<i>On the day that he offereth it, shall it be eaten</i>. It is a commandment that it be eaten thereof during the first day. I might think that he is commanded to eat the whole of it; Scripture therefore says, <i>and on the morrow</i>. I might then think that it is a commandment to eat it in two days; Scripture therefore states, <i>and that which remaineth</i> — if it remains, it remains [i.e., it may still be eaten]. If [we are to go by the expression] <i>and that which remaineth</i>, I might think that if he left it all over for the second day it is invalid [since that does not come under the term “remaineth” which indicates only a part thereof]; Scripture therefore says [<i>that which remaineth of it</i>] <i>shall be eaten</i>, even all of it.” And even if you hold the <i>vav</i> in <i>v’hanothar</i> (and that which remaineth) to be redundant, [as Rashi explained], the verse can also be explained to mean: “and on the morrow that which remained of it [from the first day] may be eaten,” but not that he is to leave it over intentionally.<br>But I do not know why Rashi held the <i>vav</i> of the verse, <i>to give ‘v’kodesh’</i> (<i>‘and’ the Sanctuary</i>) <i>and the host to be trampled upon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 8:13. The <i>vav</i> in <i>v’kodesh</i> (“and” the Sanctuary) is here redundant.</i> to be redundant, since the meaning of the verse is that [the angel] is asking: “How long shall the transgression give appalment, and how long shall the Sanctuary and the host be trampled underfoot?”<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> in <i>v’kodesh</i> thus stands for the repetition of the phrase <i>ad mathai</i> (how long), and is therefore not redundant.</i>

Verse 17

AND THAT WHICH REMAINETH OF THE FLESH OF THE OFFERING ON THE THIRD DAY SHALL BE BURNT WITH FIRE. The verse does not mean to say that that which is left over on the third day must be burnt, but it may be eaten during the preceding night, for our Rabbis have already derived from the verse in the section of <i>Kedoshim Tih’yu — and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 19:6.</i> that whatever remains after any part of the two days, must be burnt [and thus may not be eaten on the night preceding the third day]. But the expression, <i>on the third day</i>, is not connected with <i>that which remaineth</i>, but with <i>shall be burnt with fire</i> [the sense of the verse thus being as follows: “and that which remaineth of the flesh of the offering, shall be burnt with fire on the third day”]. The verse thus states that that which was left over of the flesh of the offering which was not eaten on the day when it was offered nor on the morrow, shall be burnt with fire on the third day in the morning. It is this which the Rabbis intended when saying [of the peace-offerings]<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 55 a.</i> that “they are eaten for two days and the one intervening night,” for on the second night [preceding the third day] they are neither eaten nor burnt, for Scripture required that the burning of invalidated hallowed offerings should be at daytime, just as the offering of the valid ones can only be at daytime.

Verse 25

FOR WHOSOEVER EATETH THE FAT OF THE BEAST, OF WHICH MAN PRESENTS AN OFFERING … SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE. It is impossible that the explanation of the phrase: <i>of the beast</i> [<i>of which man presents an offering</i>], is that this beast is itself an offering, so that an unconsecrated animal be excluded from this prohibition, since in the section of <i>Vayikra</i>, Scripture has already prohibited all fat in an unqualified manner,<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 3:17.</i> without any condition or exception. Here too it prohibited at first <i>all fat of ox, or sheep, or goat</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> and it further decreed against eating <i>the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> and these cannot be brought as offerings to G-d. Besides, He said there [in the section of <i>Vayikra</i>], <i>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 3:17.</i> and the expression <i>in all your dwellings</i> is never found in any matter connected with offerings. In speaking of the gifts of the priests He says many times, <i>a statute forever</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:11, etc.</i> but does not mention “in all your dwellings,” because the offerings are not “a statute forever in all your dwellings,” as they only apply in the Tabernacle and <i>in the place which the Eternal shall choose</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:14. A reference to the Sanctuary in Shiloh and to its final location in Jerusalem.</i><br>Let not the eyes of him who is mistaken<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">The allusion is to Ibn Ezra who in Verse 20 wrote that the phrase <i>in all your dwellings</i> refers also to the offerings (see the verse mentioned in the text with reference to the new produce, and also the following note).</i> be blinded by the verse, <i>And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your G-d; it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:14. On the basis of this verse Ibn Ezra argued that <i>in all your dwellings</i> applies also to the offerings, since the verse refers to the <i>omer</i> (a measure of new barley brought as a meal-offering on the second day of Passover). But Ramban answers that the phrase refers not to the <i>omer</i>, but to the new crop which, through the offering of the <i>omer</i>, was henceforth permitted to be eaten (see “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188). It is to this prohibition of eating of the new crop before the bringing of the <i>omer</i> [or before the end of the sixteenth day of Nisan], that the phrase <i>in all your dwellings</i> refers. Hence the phrase <i>in all your dwellings</i> which is stated in connection with the prohibitions against eating fat and blood (above, 3:17) must perforce mean that they are applicable everywhere, independent of the existence of the Sanctuary and its offerings.</i> For it is eating of the new crop that is forbidden by law of the Torah in all places, and Scripture is saying that we are not to eat bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears forever in all our dwelling places, until that same day on which we bring the offering of the new barley in the Sanctuary. If the offering is not brought [as when the Sanctuary is destroyed], it does not become forbidden henceforth to eat of the new crop [i.e., after the end of the sixteenth day of Nisan], for He did not say, “ye shall not eat until ye have brought the offering of your G-d,” but instead the prohibition extends <i>until this selfsame day</i> only. Rather, the meaning of <i>until this selfsame day</i> is the one on which you bring the offering when you are in a position to do so, the reason being that the offering should be a new meal-offering [but when you are not able to bring the offering, as when the Sanctuary is destroyed, the prohibition is only <i>until this selfsame day</i>]. It is possible that the word <i>hayom</i> (<i>the day</i>) is connected also with [the latter part of the verse:] “<i>until this selfsame day, until the day ye have brought the offering of your G-d</i>,” [thus clearly indicating that the prohibition depends on the <i>day</i> the offering is brought, and not on the actual bringing thereof].<br>The complete proof that the explanation of the phrase [in the verse before us] <i>the beast of which man presents an offering</i>, is “of the kind of beast from which man presents an offering,” [and not “of the beast which is itself an actual offering,” so that the unconsecrated beast would be excluded from the prohibition against eating of the fat thereof,] is that it says also in the section on valuations, <i>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Eternal, all that any man giveth of such unto the Eternal shall be holy</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 27:9.</i> and it explains that this means the kind of beast whereof men bring an offering to G-d. And so also, <i>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11.</i> here clearly stating, “any unclean beast of the kind from which offerings are not brought.” There is no difference whatever between stating it in the plural — <i>whereof men bring</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 27:9.</i> <i>of which they may not bring</i><sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11.</i> — or saying it in the singular [as in the verse before us], <i>of which man presents</i>, for the meaning is “the kind of beast of which man presents an offering.” Similarly He said, <i>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 11:39.</i> which means the kind of beast of which ye may eat, but not that the particular beast may be eaten [since it is expressly prohibited as meat, as it died without being slaughtered properly].<br>Now since He prohibited all fat of a beast whereof an offering is brought, but not of the kind of which offerings are not brought, it might enter one’s mind to say that a beast which died of itself or was torn [by other beasts] is regarded as a kind from which offerings may not be brought [and therefore their fats may be eaten]; therefore it was necessary to mention [in Verse 24] that [the fats of these animals] are forbidden, and it is this which He said, <i>and ye shall in no wise eat of it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> meaning that he who eats it is liable to excision as with all other fats, as He forbade the fat of the entire class of beasts from which offerings are brought, even of those animals which died of themselves or were torn by [wild] beasts. He states, <i>they may be used for any other service</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> meaning to say that [the fat of a clean animal which died of itself or was torn by beasts] has no law of uncleanness of carrion [but is like ordinary food which has become unclean],<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Aboth Hatum’oth</i>, 1:5.</i> for since He said, <i>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 11:8.</i> He states concerning the fat thereof that one may touch it and use it for any other service. Now if the prohibition of eating fat would apply only to that of actual offerings, why was it necessary to say there in the section of <i>Vayikra, Ye shall not eat any fat</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 3:17.</i> when He had already commanded [in the preceding verse] that it be brought up on the altar <i>as a sweet savor</i>, and how could we eat of the fire-offering of G-d? Why did He not also prohibit the eating of the lobe above the liver and the two kidneys, which are removed from the offerings [and burnt on the altar — yet these may be eaten in the case of ordinary clean animals because they do not come under the term <i>cheilev</i> (fat)].<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 3:9. Ramban is here arguing that if the prohibition against eating fats is restricted to those offered on the altar, why do we find no prohibition in connection with the other parts offered on the altar.</i> Moreover, why was it necessary to mention here, <i>Ye shall eat no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> when it is known that offerings can be brought only from them [it thus being obvious that the prohibition of <i>cheilev</i> applies to all clean animals — hallowed or unhallowed]!

THE FAT UPON THE BREAST. It appears from this verse according to its plain meaning that the breast was waved with the fat, but not the thigh. Thus the verse which states, <i>And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 9:21.</i> means that afterwards [after he had waved the fats with the breasts], he waved them [i.e., the breasts and the thigh] by themselves. But our Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 61 b.</i> that the priest placed the fats upon the hand of the owner of the offering, with the breast and thigh above them, [and waved them]. According to their opinion, the reason why waving is mentioned only in connection with the breast, is in order to serve the basis for the interpretation which they have said: “If [the parts which are to be waved] became unclean, but one of them was left [which remained clean], whence do we know that it needs waving? Scripture therefore says, <i>that the breast may be waved</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 30 before us.</i>

WHICH THE ETERNAL COMMANDED TO BE GIVEN THEM IN THE DAY THAT THEY WERE ANOINTED. The order of the verse is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">As the verse reads, it might appear that G-d only commanded that the priests be given these gifts of the peace-offerings, on the day they were anointed as priests, but not throughout the generations. Therefore Ramban explains the purport of the verse to be as explained in the text.</i> “Which the Eternal commanded, on the day that they were anointed, to be given them from the children of Israel, by a statute forever.” And the explanation of the phrase <i>in the day that they were anointed</i>, is “at the time of the anointment.” Similarly, <i>in the day when they were presented to minister</i><sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 35.</i> means: “at that time when He separated them” [to minister as priests]. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that “‘<i>b’yom</i>’ (<i>in the day</i>) <i>that they were anointed</i> means <i>mi’yom</i> (<i>from the day</i>) that they were anointed.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">The letter <i>beth</i> in the word <i>b’yom</i> (in the day) thus serves as a <i>mem</i> (<i>mi’yom</i> — from the day).

Verse 38

WHICH THE ETERNAL COMMANDED MOSES IN MOUNT SINAI. According to our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah 37 b.</i> all the commandments were expressly told to Moses on Mount Sinai, in their general rules, their specific regulations and their minute details, and some of them were repeated in the Tent of Meeting. Thus [all] the commandments in the Book of Vayikra (Leviticus) [which is prefaced by the verse stating it was made known in the Tent of Meeting], are repetitions [of those said on Sinai, which is the sense of the verse before us]. By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the meaning of the verse is:<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads: <i>Which the Eternal commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings unto the Eternal, in the wilderness of Sinai</i>. Now according to the interpretation of the Rabbis mentioned above, the sense of the verse is that the laws of the offerings were commanded to Moses “in Mount Sinai,” and were repeated to him in the Tent of Meeting “in the wilderness of Sinai.” Ramban will now explain that according to the plain meaning of Scripture this verse speaks of two separate occasions: the offerings of the seven-day consecration of the priests were commanded to Moses “in Mount Sinai,” whilst the laws of the other offerings were given to Moses “in the wilderness of Sinai,” that is, in the Tabernacle.</i> “<i>Which the Eternal commanded Moses in Mount Sinai</i>, and <i>in the day that he commanded the children of Israel</i> in the wilderness of Sinai <i>to present their offerings unto the Eternal</i>,” for He gave the commandment about the consecration-offerings [of the priests] <i>in Mount Sinai</i>, as also in the case of the burnt-offering and sin-offering [which were part of the consecration], and He commanded concerning the meal-offering, guilt-offering, and peace-offerings, <i>in the wilderness of Sinai</i>, in the Tent of Meeting.<br>It is possible that the expression <i>in Mount Sinai</i> means “in this place in front of Mount Sinai,” which is in the Tent of Meeting. Similarly, <i>It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:6.</i> does not mean on the mountain itself, for the continual burnt-offering [i.e., the Daily Whole-offering brought for all Israel] began only in the Tent of Meeting, as it is written, <i>Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year day by day continually</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:38.</i> So also: <i>And they set forward from the Mount of the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 10:33.</i> [which means “from before the Mount of the Eternal”]; <i>ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain</i><sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 1:6.</i> [which means “in front of this mountain”]. The sense of all these verses is that Israel had encamped before Mount Sinai nearby, as it is written, <i>and there Israel encamped before the Mount</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:2.</i> There [in the wilderness of Sinai] they stayed until they journeyed from there to the wilderness of Paran.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 10:12: <i>And the children of Israel set forward by their stages out of the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</i>.</i> Thus they made the Tent of Meeting and erected it before the Mount on its east side, and it was there that they began offering the Daily Whole-offering. In the second year [after the exodus] they were commanded concerning the standards,<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:1; 2:1-31.</i> and they set the Tent of Meeting <i>in the midst of the camps</i><sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:17.</i> when they journeyed. It is for this reason that Scripture says here that <i>this is the law of the burnt-offering</i><sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 37 here.</i> and of all the offerings which G-d commanded [Moses] <i>in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded</i> [<i>the children of Israel</i>] … <i>in the wilderness of Sinai</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 38 here.</i> Scripture thus states that it was in Mount Sinai and in the desert of Sinai, in order to inform us that it was not on the mountain itself, in the place of the Glory where G-d told to Moses the Ten Commandments, nor in the desert of Sinai after they had journeyed from before the Mount. Rather, it was in the wilderness of Sinai, in front of the mountain within its environs and nearby, and there was the Tent of Meeting, as He said at the beginning of the subject of the offerings, <i>And He called unto Moses, and the Eternal spoke unto him out of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:1.</i> and now He informed us of the place of the Tent of Meeting.

TAKE AARON. “This section [concerning the seven days of consecration of the priests] was said seven days before the [final] erection of the Tabernacle [which took place on the first day of Nisan],<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">During each of the seven days of consecration Moses set the Tabernacle up and then dismantled it. But on the eighth day [which was the first of Nisan] the final erection took place, and it was no longer dismantled until they journeyed from Mount Sinai.</i> for there is no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Since the final erection of the Tabernacle is already mentioned at the end of the Book of Exodus (40:17), and the section before us, according to Rashi, was said seven days <i>before</i> the final erection, we must perforce say that there is no strict chronological order in the narrative of the Torah. In other words, chronologically the proper place of this section here in the Book of Leviticus is before Exodus, Chapter 40! Ramban will strongly dissent to this interpretation of Rashi.</i> Thus the language of Rashi. But why should we invert the words of the living G-d! Moreover, in the section of <i>On the first day of the first month</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:2.</i> He commanded concerning the erection of the whole Tabernacle, the clothing of Aaron and his sons and the anointing of all of them, and there He narrated Moses’ deeds in the matter of the erection of the Tabernacle,<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17-33.</i> but did not mention anything concerning Aaron and his sons till here. And how could it be that He separated one subject into two sections, [as follows from Rashi], placing the later one [i.e., the final erection of the Tabernacle which took place on the first of Nisan, as recorded in the Book of Exodus], before the earlier one [i.e., the seven days of consecration that began on the twenty-third of Adar which He placed here in the Book of Leviticus]!<br>Rather, the correct interpretation is that we say that Moses was commanded about the erection of the Tabernacle on the twenty-third day of Adar, and he erected it [on that day]. As soon as the Tabernacle stood in its position G-d, blessed be He, <i>Who sitteth upon the cherubim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 4:4.</i> called Moses and commanded him about the actions involved in the bringing of the offerings — all those sections from the beginning of the Book of <i>Vayikra</i> until here. [This was because] He wanted to teach him the actions and statutes of all the offerings before he offered up any of them, since among the initiation-offerings were the sin-offering, burnt-offering and peace-offering, and they could only know all their laws from these sections with which He preceded [to command <i>him</i>]. Afterwards He said to him, <i>Take Aaron and his sons with him</i> etc., to urge him on when the time came for performing what He had told him at first — <i>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me etc</i>.,<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:1.</i> adding here, <i>And assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3 here.</i> so that it should be done in the presence of all of them, that they should know that G-d, blessed be He, chose Aaron and his sons [to minister unto Him].<br>By way of the proper interpretation of Scripture, Moses was commanded about the building of the Tabernacle prior to the incident of the golden calf [as is the order of these chapters in the Book of Exodus],<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">The commandment concerning the building of the Tabernacle is in <i>Seder Terumah</i> (Chapters 25-27), and the story of the golden calf is in <i>Seder Ki Thisa</i> (Chapter 32). — This is unlike Rashi’s statement (<i>ibid.</i>, 31:18) that the incident of the golden calf happened a considerable time before the command regarding the work of the Tabernacle. Hence Ramban preceded this discussion with the expression, “by way of the proper interpretation …” in order to indicate that his view is different than that stated elsewhere in Rashi’s commentary.</i> and when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to him and promised him that He would cause His Divine Glory to dwell among them, Moses understood of his own accord that the command concerning the Tabernacle remained valid as before, and he then commanded Israel regarding it, as I have explained in the section of <i>Vayakheil</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 35:1.</i> After they had completed the work, he was then told the section of <i>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 40:2.</i> and he was then told, <i>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the Tent of Meeting</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> Thus Moses knew that Aaron and his sons also remained in their esteemed and beloved position before G-d. Here He urged them again on the first day of the consecration, at the time of performing the command [<i>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons</i> etc.]<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> Thus all the sections of the Torah are in chronological order, except that He placed before its sequence the verse, <i>And the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> which in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, at the beginning of <i>Seder Shemini</i>.</i> was on the eighth day of the initiation, in order to arrange in order the whole matter of the erection of the Tabernacle, it being the customary way of Scripture in all places to finish a subject that it has started to explain.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. I, p. 431, for a similar instance.</i>

AND HE WASHED THEM WITH WATER. It appears likely to me that Scripture tells that he [Moses] washed all of them, but nonetheless it was not done to all of them together. Rather, he washed Aaron and clothed him with his garments and anointed him, and afterwards he washed his sons and anointed them.

Verse 7

AND HE PUT UPON HIM THE TUNIC AND HE GIRDED HIM WITH THE BELT. This was the order in which Moses did it. But in the section containing the command, He said, <i>and thou shalt put upon Aaron the tunic, and the robe of the ephod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:5.</i> [and mentioned the belt only later on in the section, and not right after the tunic, as here], because there He wanted to mention the belt for Aaron and his sons in one command, saying, <i>And thou shalt gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9. Thus the <i>command</i> for the belt, referring as it did to both Aaron as High Priest and his sons as common priests, is mentioned there once in connection with both, in order to save repeating it; but here where the actual fulfillment of the command is narrated, Scripture mentions all the garments that Aaron was clothed in together, separate from those of his sons.</i> Thus Moses clothed Aaron with the tunic and the belt, and afterwards with the robe and the ephod, in the order mentioned there.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> Here [when performing the command] <i>he girded him with the skilfully-woven band of the ephod</i><sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 7 before us.</i> before he placed the breastplate upon him,<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> [while in the section containing the command the breastplate is mentioned <i>before</i> the skilfully-woven band of the ephod], for Moses knew that the usual way of dressing is that immediately after putting on a garment, one girds it with the belt made for it. Therefore, he girded him with the belt immediately after the tunic, and with the skilfully-woven band [of the ephod] immediately after the ephod, it being improper that the putting on of the ephod should be done with intermissions. But there [in the section containing the command] it is said, <i>and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skilfully-woven band of the ephod</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> because He dealt briefly there with the subject of the breastplate, and did not say that it be placed on the ephod, nor that he should put in it the Urim and the Thummim,<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:30.

This too<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban on Verse 7.</i> Moses did in the proper order, for so he was commanded [in the section on the making] of the oil of anointment: <i>And thou shalt anoint therewith the Tent of Meeting</i> etc., <i>and thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:26 and 30.</i> Therefore Moses did not want to anoint the Tabernacle until he had clothed Aaron, and then he anointed them together, so that the one who is to perform the Divine Service should be ready, as it were, to come at once into the Sanctuary to minister. It sufficed to do so in the case of Aaron, for he was <i>the holy one of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 106:16. — Hence Aaron was dressed first with the priestly garments after the Tabernacle had been erected and not yet anointed, so that the two could be anointed together. This was not the case with Aaron’s sons, who were dressed and anointed after the Tabernacle and Aaron had been anointed.</i> although in the command regarding the erecting of the Tabernacle it is written, <i>and thou shalt anoint the Tabernacle, and all that is therein</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:9.</i> and afterwards, <i>and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shalt wash them with water. And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12-13.</i> for there He arranged all that was done to Aaron and his sons in one verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">But in reality the anointing of the Tabernacle took place after Aaron had been dressed by Moses in his priestly garments, as is stated here [for the reason mentioned in the text].</i>

Verse 11

AND HE SPRINKLED THEREOF [i.e., of the anointing oil] UPON THE ALTAR. Rashi commented: “I do not know where Moses was commanded about these sprinklings.” It is possible that that which He said of the altar, <i>and thou shalt sanctify the altar, and the altar shall be most holy</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> means that he should add this sanctification to the altar through the sprinklings [of the anointing oil], and it could not be done merely by anointing the altar, for the expression <i>and the altar shall be most holy</i>, means that he should give it an additional sanctity above that of the other anointed things in the Tabernacle and all its vessels. Moses thus sanctified the altar in the same way that he was commanded to do to the ministering priests, concerning whom He said, <i>and thou shalt sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:21.</i> since the altar, which is the vessel for the offerings, is not of a lesser degree of holiness than the garments of the ministering priests, and it is an inference from minor to major [that if the garments had to be sprinkled with the anointing oil, surely the altar, being more holy, had to be sprinkled]! And so also is it said with reference to the Day of Atonement, <i>And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it</i> [the altar] <i>with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:19.</i> Thus [we see that] all sanctifications of the altar were done by sprinklings, and it follows all the more so that [when the altar was consecrated] at the very beginning that it had to be sanctified by sprinkling from uncleanness and “strangeness” [i.e., from that which is not holy].<br>Scripture did not mention here [in Verse 13] the anointing of Aaron’s sons, for it is self-evident that Moses did to them as he did to their father, in accordance with that which he was commanded, <i>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:15.</i> and He included it here in saying with reference to the sons that everything was done <i>as the Eternal commanded Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i><br>It appears to me that the anointing of Aaron’s sons was not done by means of pouring the oil on their heads, for that is said only of Aaron, <i>Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his</i> [Aaron’s] <i>head, and anoint him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:7.</i> but the anointing of the sons is not mentioned there at all, as it was not done by means of pouring the oil as in Aaron’s case. It is [also] possible that there was no anointing of the sons, except for the sprinklings which Moses sprinkled on Aaron’s sons and their garments from the oil of anointment. Thus you see in the section of <i>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 1.</i> that He commanded to anoint the father [i.e., Aaron], as it says, <i>Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:7.</i> but did not command to anoint the sons at all, either by pouring of the oil, or by anointing. However, in the section of the erection of the Tabernacle He says, <i>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:15.</i> because He did not mention the sprinklings there at all, [hence He mentioned “anointing,” whilst referring really to sprinkling]. Similarly, in the section of the oil of anointment [the verse mentions anointing of Aaron and his sons<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:26 and 30.</i> because it does not mention the sprinklings at all]. But <i>both</i> sprinkling and anointing are nowhere mentioned with reference to the sons of Aaron in one place. Therefore I say that he only did one of the two to them, namely, the sprinklings.

AND HE PURIFIED THE ALTAR. “He cleansed it and purified it from anything ‘strange’ [not holy], so that it might enter into a state of holiness. AND HE SANCTIFIED IT by this rite. TO MAKE ATONEMENT UPON IT — from that time onward for all atonements of sin.” This is the language of Rashi.<br>If this is so, then Scripture is saying that by these means the altar was hallowed and made fit to effect atonement upon from that time onward. This is similar to that which is said in the Book of Ezekiel, <i>Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; so shall they consecrate it. And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings, and I will accept you, saith the Eternal G-d</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 43:26-27.</i> Here He teaches that this consecration is done with blood, but the burning of the fats is no hindrance to the consecration of the altar, for in succeeding generations too it is no hindrance to the atonement [if the fats of the offering were not burnt on the altar].<br>But in the Tosephta of the section of consecration<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav Milu’im</i> 15.</i> I have seen [the following text]: “I know not what is this atonement for the altar. [I must say that] from here<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">See my Hebrew commentary, p. 40, Note 74 that <i>mikaan</i> (from here) is the preferred text. Our books of the Torath Kohanim have the word <i>minayin</i> (from whence).</i> you learn that this atonement was only necessary because Moses said: ‘When the call was issued to bring freewill donations for the Sanctuary, the people pressured each other, both men and women, and some donated without their complete will; let this be an atonement so that they should not donate to the Sanctuary anything which had been taken by force.’ And so it also says, <i>For I the Eternal love justice, I hate robbery in a burnt-offering</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 61:8. “Although the burnt-offering is wholly Mine, I hate it yet if it is brought through robbery” (Rashi, Succah 30 a).</i> Rashi has also mentioned this already in the section of <i>V’atah Tetzaveh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:36.</i>

Verse 17

AND THE BULLOCK, ‘V’ETH ORO'(AND ITS SKIN), AND ITS FLESH, AND ITS DUNG, HE BURNT WITH FIRE. Included in the term “the bullock” are those parts which were burnt that are not included in “the flesh,” namely the bones, sinews, horns, and hoofs, besides its skin, its flesh, and its dung. Or perhaps the <i>vav</i> [in the word <i>v’eth — v’eth oro</i> (‘and’ its skin)] is one of those redundant letters [thus making the sense of the verse: “and the bullock — its skin, and its flesh, etc.”], it being similar to the verse, <i>And the heifer shall be burnt in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burnt</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 19:5.</i>

Verse 20

AND THE RAM WAS CUT INTO PIECES. This cutting into pieces was done only after flaying, but Scripture shortened its account here by omitting the flaying, since He had already commanded about it in the section of the burnt-offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:6.</i> He states [here in this verse], <i>and Moses caused the head, and the pieces to burn</i> [on the altar], which means “at the time of burning it,” namely, after <i>he washed the inwards and the legs in water</i> [mentioned in the following verse]. It is with reference to this that He states, <i>and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> for after the washing he burnt everything at the same time. Scripture, however, separated them [stating here in Verse 20 that he burnt the head and the pieces, etc., and afterwards in Verse 21 that he washed the inwards and the legs], so as to teach us that the pieces do not need washing.

Verse 21



Verse 22

AND HE PRESENTED THE OTHER RAM, THE RAM OF ‘HAMILU’IM’ (CONSECRATION). I have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:41.</i> that the meaning of “consecration” is that the priests should be fully empowered to perform the Divine Service, and that this term is applied to both the altar itself and to those who perform the Service. Thus all these offerings [the bullock of the sin-offering, the ram of the burnt-offering, etc.,] were brought for the purpose of consecrating the priests, as it is written, <i>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me in the priest’s office: take one young bullock and two rams without blemish</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:1.</i> The second ram, however, is here called specifically <i>the ram of consecration</i>, because it was the last of these offerings, and it was after it that their consecration was completed and they ministered before Him, blessed be He, for all these offerings were indispensable in the matter.<br>It is possible that the [purpose of the] sin-offering was to effect atonement for the altar and to sanctify it, for it is so written;<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, Verse 15.</i> and that the burnt-offering was to expiate for the priests, like the atonement effected by all freewill burnt-offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 1:4.</i> and the second ram which was the peace-offering, was a thanksgiving to G-d for having given them in His house and within His walls a monument and a memorial.<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">See Isaiah 56:5.</i> Thus it was only the peace-offering which was brought for the purpose of consecration, and therefore it alone is here called “the ram of <i>milu’im</i>” (consecration). It is called <i>milu’im</i> [in the plural, although the offering for that purpose was, according to this interpretation, only one], because the fats and the thigh as well as the heave-offering of the bread were all burnt.<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 25-28.</i>

AND MOSES TOOK OF THE ANOINTING OIL, AND OF THE BLOOD WHICH WAS UPON THE ALTAR [AND SPRINKLED IT UPON AARON etc.]. I do not know whether he mixed [the oil with the blood] for these sprinklings, something like that which it says, <i>and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:18. The accepted opinion in the Talmud (Yoma 57 b) is that he mixed the two together.</i> Nor has it become clear to me why Moses performed these sprinklings after the burning of the ram of consecration, for in the section containing the command about the consecration Services He mentioned first the sprinklings,<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:21.</i> and only afterwards He said, <i>And thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 22.</i> Perhaps since He said there [in the same verse where He mentioned these sprinklings], <i>and he</i> [Aaron] <i>and his garments shall be hallowed, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:21.</i> Moses deduced that these sprinklings were the last things to be done to them, through which they would become completely holy, for in connection with anointing the priests He did not mention the term “hallowed,” nor in connection with the placing of the blood upon their thumbs.<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> [Therefore, since it is only stated in connection with the sprinklings of the oil and the blood that the priests are to become hallowed, Moses deduced that this was to be done <i>after</i> the burning of the ram of consecration.] And when it says here [immediately following Moses’ pouring the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head], <i>and he anointed him, to sanctify him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12.</i> it was not a complete sanctification until Moses had done the sprinklings, even as it says [in the verse before us, after he had done the sprinklings], <i>and he sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons</i>. Thus he completed the sanctification of the father and sons together by means of these sprinklings. The Rabbis have also said so in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tzav Milu’im</i> 34.</i> “<i>And he sanctified Aaron</i>. From here you learn that the sanctification of Aaron and his sons was completed only with the sprinkling of the blood.”

Verse 32

AND THAT WHICH REMAINETH ‘BABASAR UBALACHEM.’ The letter <i>beth</i> in these two words [which means literally: “‘in’ the meat and ‘in’ the bread”] serves here as a <i>mem</i> the meaning thus being: “and that which remains ‘of’ the meat and ‘of’ the bread. ”<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 7:36.</i> Similarly: ‘<i>bayom ha’shemini</i>’ (<i>‘on’ the eighth day</i>), <i>and forward</i><sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 43:27.</i> [means <i>miyom ha’shemini</i> — “from” the eighth day on]; <i>and they oppressed and crushed the children of Israel ‘bashanah hahi</i> (<i>‘in’ that year</i>) <i>eighteen years</i><sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 10:8.</i> [means <i>mishanah hahi</i> — <i>from’ that year</i>].<br>Scripture does not state: and that which remained “till the morning,” for they had already learned the law of the offerings and knew that these peace-offerings were to be regarded like the stricter offerings which are eaten for a day and a night,<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">This is unlike the ordinary peace-offering, which may be eaten for two days and the intervening night. See Note 55 above.</i> [since they were accompanied by breads like a thanks-offering].

Verse 35

AND AT THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING SHALL YE ABIDE DAY AND NIGHT SEVEN DAYS, AND KEEP THE CHARGE OF THE ETERNAL, THAT YE DIE NOT. In the opinion of the Beraitha of Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 42. See also Ramban further, 10:6, where he quotes again this Beraitha more fully.</i> the meaning of this verse is that <i>they shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i><sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 33.</i> day and night at the time of the service, that is to say, until they finish all the work incumbent upon them at that time. This is a commandment which applies for all generations, that a priest may not leave the Sanctuary while he is ministering the Service,<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 157-160.</i> and he is liable to death [by the hand of Heaven, for the transgression thereof]. It is with reference to this that He said about the High Priest, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane</i> [<i>the Sanctuary of G-d</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:12.</i> The Rabbis have said about this:<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 42. See also Ramban further, 10:6, where he quotes again this Beraitha more fully.</i> “When is he not permitted to go out of the Sanctuary [and must stay there in order] not to profane it? One must say that this applies only when he is ministering.” And they have further interpreted:<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 42. See also Ramban further, 10:6, where he quotes again this Beraitha more fully.</i> “[<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>,] <i>lest ye die</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 10:7.</i> From the negative you infer the positive [that if they do go out whilst ministering, they are liable to death by the hand of Heaven]. I would only know that Aaron and his sons, who were anointed with the oil of anointment, are liable to death [by the hand of Heaven] if they leave the Sanctuary while they are ministering. How do I know that the prohibition applies also to all priests at all times? Scripture therefore says, <i>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 10:7.</i> The meaning of that is as follows: since He did not say: “for you are anointed with the anointing oil of the Eternal,” but instead He said “upon you,” it is like the verse, <i>and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:15.</i>

Verse 36

AND AARON AND HIS SONS DID ALL THE THINGS WHICH THE ETERNAL COMMANDED BY THE HAND OF MOSES. Everywhere in this section it says <i>‘as’ the Eternal commanded Moses</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verses 13, 17, 21, 29. The Hebrew text here reads: “as the Eternal commanded ‘by the hand of’ Moses.” But this expression I did not find in the Five Books of Moses, but in the Book of Joshua (14:2, etc.). And Ramban’s aim is clearly to distinguish everything that Moses did, which was exactly “as” G-d had commanded him, from that which the sons of Aaron did, as explained in the text. Hence it would seem to be correct that the reading in the text should be “as the Eternal commanded Moses.” It is so also in the Tur who quotes the language of Ramban.</i> but here, since Aaron’s sons added to the command [by bringing <i>strange fire which He had not commanded them</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 10:1.</i> He does not say it in this way, since they did not do as the Eternal commanded Moses. Rather, the verse states that they did all the things <i>‘which’ the Eternal commanded</i>, and they further added to them “the strange fire” of which He said that <i>He had not commanded them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 10:1.</i><br>Shemini

Chapter 9



Verse 1



Verse 2

AND HE [Moses] SAID TO AARON: TAKE THEE A BULL-CALF FOR A SIN-OFFERING. Moses, our teacher, had been commanded about these offerings, as he said at the end [of the section], <i>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> although this [command for these specific offerings] is not expressly mentioned. Similarly, <i>And Moses said: This is the thing which the Eternal hath commanded: Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 16:32.</i> [where the verse indicates that Moses received a Divine command although it is not specifically mentioned]. Also, <i>I am the G-d of Beth-el</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 31:13.</i> when Jacob related [to his wives all that G-d’s angel had told him in the dream], even though it is not mentioned in Scripture that he was so told. I have already shown to you<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 11:1. Also <i>ibid.</i>, 12:21.</i> many such examples in the sections on the commandments regarding the Passover.

Verse 3

<i>And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</i>. This means that Aaron is to speak to them thus, as it was His wish that Aaron should be the one who commands in the name of G-d, and that he should be the one who would bring the offerings, in order to elevate him in the eyes of the people. The correct interpretation is that the expression <i>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</i>, means you [Aaron] and the elders mentioned [in Verse 1], since it was for that purpose that he called them,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">As Verse 1 states: <i>And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel</i>.</i> so that they should speak to the children of Israel, as in the verse, <i>And Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them: Draw out</i> [<i>and take you lambs</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:21.</i> Or it may be that [Moses] said to each of the elders, <i>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</i> [the singular word <i>thou</i> thus referring to each one of the elders]. Accordingly, the meaning of the section is as follows: <i>and he</i> [Moses] <i>said to Aaron: Take thee</i> etc., and to [each of] the elders he said, <i>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak</i>. For one who speaks to many people usually addresses his command to each person individually, something like that which it is said, <i>And I commanded you at that time, saying</i> etc.: <i>Ye shall pass over armed before your brethren</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 3:18.</i> There are many such cases in the Book of Deuteronomy [where Moses speaks to the whole congregation, when his message is actually addressed to each person individually].<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that the verse, <i>And Moses said: This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> means that “Moses had already told them, <i>this is the thing</i>.” If so, it is possible that the meaning of the verses be as follows: Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel, <i>and Moses said: This thing which the Eternal has commanded</i> me <i>ye should do, that the Glory of the Eternal may appear unto you;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> <i>and he said unto Aaron: Take thee a bull-calf</i> etc.; <i>and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3. — Ibn Ezra thus transposes the contents of Verse 6, and explains that it was said immediately in Verse 1, as an introduction to the specific commands following.</i> Thus [Moses] spoke briefly at first [as in Verse 6] and then explained himself at the end [in Verses 2-4].<br>But this is not correct. Rather, after Moses had mentioned to them the offerings [which they were required to bring on that day], <i>and they brought that which Moses commanded</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> he said to them again, <i>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded that ye should do</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> meaning that they should bring the offerings in the order that he would command them, and afterwards the Glory of the Eternal would appear to them. Now since he had said, <i>for today the Eternal appeareth unto you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> he went back and said that He would appear to them through His Glory.<br>Now these offerings [which were brought on the eighth day after the completion of the seven-day consecration of the priests], were not mentioned in the section of <i>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:1.</i> for there He only gave the command about the consecration, and their days of consecration were completed with the seven days and their offerings, but now on the eighth day, they themselves brought the offerings [whereas on the seven days of the consecration, the offerings were brought by Moses]. Thus these offerings [brought on the eighth day] were a kind of initiation for the priests, as was the meal-offering of the baken cakes<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 6:13-15.</i> command for future generations [which were brought] <i>on the day when he is anointed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 13. I.e., on the day that the ordinary priests are installed into the priestly service. The High Priest, however, brought this meal-offering every day. Ramban thus suggests that the offerings brought on the eighth day [as explained in this section] were a sort of initiation, comparable to the meal-offering brought in future generations by the ordinary priest once in his lifetime, and by the High Priest every day.</i><br>It is possible that it was in order to atone for the incident of the golden calf that He now gave them these added offerings, for at the time when He commanded the section of <i>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto Me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:1.</i> the golden calf had not yet been made, as I have explained,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 8:1: “By way of the proper interpretation of Scripture etc.”</i> and therefore He did not mention them [these offerings] there. It is thus not as Rashi wrote there,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:1.</i> that the bullock [offered on each of the seven days of consecration] was to atone for the incident of the golden calf, but these bullocks were to purify the altar,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 8:15.</i> and for Aaron and his sons in order <i>to hallow them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:1.</i> and it was this calf [brought] on the eighth day that was to atone for the incident of the golden calf. Thus Aaron’s offerings [on this eight day] were the same as his offerings on the Day of Atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:3: <i>Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering</i>.</i> [namely, the bull-calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, as mentioned in the verse before us], and the people’s sin-offering [on this eighth day] was the same as their sin-offering on the Day of Atonement, namely, one <i>he-goat for a sin-offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3 here, and further, 16:5. — On the Day of Atonement there were actually two he-goats for a sin-offering, but only one was brought as an offering in the Sanctuary (see further, 16:8-22).</i> So also have the Rabbis said in the Tosephta of the section of consecration, in the Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, at the beginning of <i>Shemini</i> 4.</i> that this calf [brought on the eighth day] was to atone for the incident of the golden calf. Thus they interpreted: “For what reason did Israel bring more offerings [on this day] than Aaron?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Israel’s sin-offering on that day was a he-goat, while Aaron’s was a calf. As a burnt-offering Israel brought a calf and a ram, while Aaron’s was only a ram. The Torath Kohanim suggests a reason why the people’s offerings had to be more than those of Aaron, and also why their sin-offering was a he-goat, unlike that of Aaron which was a calf.</i> It was on account of what He said to them: ‘You [the people] have in your hands [sin] at the beginning, and you have in your hands [sin] at the end.’ You have sinned at the beginning, as it is written [when the brothers sold Joseph], <i>and they killed a he-goat</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 37:31.</i> and you have sinned at the end, as it is said, <i>they have made them a molten calf</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 32:8.</i> Therefore let them bring the he-goat [for a sin-offering] to atone for the incident connected with that of the he-goat, and let them bring a calf [as a burnt-offering] to atone for the incident of the golden calf.”<br>It would appear that because the reason for Aaron’s sin-offering [on this eighth day] was the same as that of his sin-offering on the Day of Atonement, therefore he burnt it [outside the camp]<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 11. Rashi wrote that this was done at the express command of G-d. But Ramban at this point suggests that this procedure was adopted on the basis of a similar law on the Day of Atonement, since the reason for both offerings was identical.</i> as the one of the Day of Atonement is burnt,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:27.</i> even though this sin-offering [of the eighth day] was “an outer sin-offering”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Tzav</i>, Note 52. Ramban’s concluding thought here — “for Moses did not explain that he should do so” — is thus to be understood as follows: Since Scripture does not relate that Moses commanded Aaron to burn his sin-offering outside the camp although it was not “an inner sin-offering,” the question arises why did Aaron do so [as stated in Verse 11]? It must be, Ramban suggests, because the reason for Aaron’s sin-offering on this eighth day of the initiation was the same as that of his sin-offering on the Day of Atonement, which being “an inner sin-offering” is rightfully burnt outside the camp, and hence Aaron on this eighth day did similarly. In the text following, Ramban will suggest that Aaron actually received this command from Moses, and the reason why Scripture did not mention it is explained in the text of Ramban.</i> [while that of the Day of Atonement was “an inner sin-offering”], for Moses did not explain that he should do so. But perhaps Aaron was indeed so commanded, and [it is not mentioned because] Scripture did not want to prolong the matter, it being known that Aaron would only do what Moses said, and that Moses would only say what G-d had commanded.

DRAW NEAR UNTO THE ALTAR. 8. AND AARON DREW NEAR UNTO THE ALTAR AND SLEW THE CALF. It seems to me in accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture that Moses said to Aaron: “Draw near to the north side of the altar and offer there the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, for they are to be slaughtered on the north side of the altar.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:11; 6:18.</i> Moses, however, said it briefly since Aaron already knew [that these offerings were to be slaughtered on the north side of the altar].<br>Our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim were, however, prompted by [the use of] these expressions to draw a parable [and to say]:<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Shemini</i> 8. The Rabbis were prompted by the use of the phrase “draw near,” which Ramban explained to mean “draw near to the north side of the altar.”</i> “To what can this be compared? To a human king who married a woman, who in her shyness [did not dare to enter] before him. Her sister then approached her, saying, ‘My sister, why did you enter this matter? Was it not in order that you serve the king? Embolden yourself and go in to serve the king!’ Similarly did Moses say to Aaron: ‘My brother! Why were you chosen to be the High Priest? Was it not so that you minister before G-d? Embolden yourself and come and do your priestly activities.’ Some Rabbis say that Aaron saw the [horned] altar in <i>the form of the bull</i> [which — as stated in Psalms 106: 20 — Israel had worshipped], and he was frightened by it. Then Moses came near and said to him, ‘My brother, Aaron, do not be afraid of that which you fear. Embolden yourself and come near it.’ This is why he said, <i>draw near unto the altar</i>, and [Aaron] drew near unto the altar — with zeal.” The reason for this [apparition which Aaron saw in the altar] was that since Aaron was <i>the holy one of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 106:16.</i> having no sin on his soul except for the incident of the golden calf, therefore that sin was firmly fixed in his mind, something like that which is said, <i>and my sin is ever before me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 51:5.</i> It thus appeared to him as if the form of the calf was there [in the altar] preventing his [attaining] atonement [through the offerings he was to bring]. That is why Moses said to him, “Embolden yourself so that you should not be of such humble spirit,” <i>for G-d has already accepted</i> his <i>works</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Ecclesiastes 9:7.</i> Other scholars explain that it was Satan who showed him this apparition, just as they have said there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Shemini</i> 3.</i> “My brother Aaron, although G-d has agreed to grant atonement for your sin, you must nonetheless close the mouth of Satan [through your offerings], lest he accuse you when you enter the Sanctuary etc.” And the expression, <i>and make atonement for thyself, and for the people</i> means as follows: “<i>draw near unto the altar</i> to bring all the offerings, <i>and offer</i> first <i>thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself</i> first with thy offerings, <i>and for the people</i> afterwards, through bringing their offering and atoning for them by means thereof.” Thus Moses taught Aaron that the guiltless should come and effect atonement for those who are guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 43 b.</i>

BESIDES THE BURNT-OFFERING OF THE MORNING. Scripture had to mention this here, in order to teach us that the burnt-offering of the people [which was a special offering for that day] did not exempt [them from bringing] the Daily burnt-offering, nor did it precede it [as nothing may ever be offered before the Daily burnt-offering of the morning]. But Scripture did not have to mention this about the seven days of consecration [namely that the offerings of those days were to be offered <i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>], because those were offerings of individuals [i.e., Aaron and his sons] to consecrate them as priests, and it is self-understood that such offerings did not exempt [them from bringing] the Daily burnt-offering, nor did they precede it.<br>In the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Shemini</i> 12. The meaning of this quote will be explained by Ramban further on in the text.</i> “<i>And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom and burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>. What does this come to teach us? Shall we say it teaches us that if he could not obtain the meal-offering [which was offered with every burnt-offering] that he should nevertheless bring the animal [as a burnt-offering]? [That could not be the case], for it has already been stated, <i>And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinances</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16.</i> If so, why does it say, <i>and he burnt it</i> [i.e., the meal-offering] <i>upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>? It is to teach us that there were two meal-offerings there, one for the [Daily] burnt-offering and one [brought] by itself” [for the burnt-offering of the people, which was a special offering of that eighth day].<br>The meaning of this text [of the Torath Kohanim] is as follows: Had Scripture stated, “And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinance, besides the burnt-offering of the morning,” the sense thereof would have been to teach that the Daily burnt-offering precedes [the other offerings], as He says in the section of the Additional Offerings, <i>it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:15.</i> <i>beside the continual burnt-offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 31.</i> But since He mentioned the meal-offering — stating, <i>And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i> — it appears that [the phrase, <i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>] is said with reference to the meal-offering. Therefore the Rabbis commented that if it comes to say that he offered this meal-offering alone, but did not offer the drink-offering of the Daily burnt-offering nor that of the people’s burnt-offering [of the eighth day], because he only found [ingredients] for this freewill meal-offering — [that could not be the case]. For [in the preceding verse] it has already been stated, <i>And the burnt-offering was presented, and he offered it according to the ordinance</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16. This shows that the drink-offering was brought together with the people’s burnt-offering of the eighth day, for otherwise it would not have been <i>according to the ordinance</i>. The question then re-appears: why is the phrase <i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i> mentioned in connection with the meal-offering?</i> which means that it was offered according to its ordinance, with the drink-offering. [Thus we cannot derive from here a principle that the lack of the drink-offering does not prevent the bringing of the offering itself, if the meal-offering and the wine for the drink-offering are not obtainable.] If so, why does it say, <i>And the meal-offering was presented</i> etc. <i>and he burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i>? It is to teach that he offered this meal-offering [of the people’s burnt-offering brought on the eighth day] “<i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i> and its meal-offering,” for this meal-offering was not the drink-offering [which is an obligatory part of the Daily burnt-offering], but was the <i>freewill</i> meal-offering of Israel [namely part of the burnt-offering of the people which they brought on that day].<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For one might have thought that since the burnt-offering of the people brought especially on this eighth day was also a public one, it should be exempted from the duty of bringing a meal-offering, as the meal-offering of the Daily Whole-offering had already been brought; hence Scripture stated that this meal-offering which came with the people’s burnt-offering, was offered “<i>besides the burnt-offering of the morning</i> and its meal-offering.” It should be pointed out that Ramban refers to this meal-offering as <i>minchath-nedavah</i> (“<i>freewill</i> — meal-offering”) not because of its voluntary nature, namely that it be optional for Israel to bring it or not. The name <i>minchath-nedavah</i> is only to distinguish it from the meal-offering which constantly accompanied the Daily Whole-offering of the people, while this one represented the willing spirit of the people on this day. See further my Hebrew commentary p. 45.</i>

Verse 18



Verse 19

V’HAMECHASEH’ AND THAT WHICH COVERETH THE INWARDS. “That is, the fat which covers the inwards.” Thus the language of Rashi. But it does not appear to me to be correct, for why should He mention [only] this particular fat and not the other fats [which were burnt on the altar]?<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 3:3-4.</i> Rather, the word <i>hamechaseh</i> in my opinion is a term for all the fats, since all fats which are burnt on the altar are “covering” [fats]. One is <i>the fat which covereth the inwards</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:3, etc.</i> and the second is <i>all the fat that is upon the inwards</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:3, etc.</i> and that too “covers” [the inwards]; the fat which is upon the kidneys covers them, as does also the fat <i>which is upon the loins</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> This is similar to that which the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 93 a.</i> “Fat which the meat covers is permissible to be eaten, for the Merciful One said, the fat <i>which is upon the loins</i> [is called ‘fat’], and not that which is within the loins.” This verse is thus a continuation of the above: <i>and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> of the ox and the ram mentioned [in the first part of that verse], <i>and the fat of the ox</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 19 before us.</i> but <i>of the ram</i> they presented to him the fat tail and “the fat” [as the word <i>mechaseh</i> indicates], and of the two [the ox and the ram, they presented to him] <i>the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver</i>. Scripture states, <i>And they put the fat upon the breasts</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i> for they placed the fat tail, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver at the bottom, and the [other] fats on the top of them, and everything upon the breasts. Thus the fats alone were visible above, this being the respectful way to burn them [on the altar].

Verse 20

AND HE BURNT THE FAT UPON THE ALTAR — together with the others mentioned [namely, <i>the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the lobe of the liver</i>, and the breasts]. But because the burning of the fats is greater, He mentions [only] them. Similarly, <i>it consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fats</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24. Here too, Scripture singles out “the fats,” although the fire also consumed the tail, etc., because the burning of the fats was greater.</i>

Verse 21



Verse 22

AND AARON LIFTED UP HIS HANDS TOWARD THE PEOPLE, AND BLESSED THEM — “with the priestly benediction: <i>The Eternal bless thee</i> …. <i>The Eternal make His face shine upon thee … The Eternal lift up His countenance upon thee …</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:24-26.</i> Thus the language of Rashi. But if so, the section of <i>Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying: Thus ye shall bless the children of Israel</i>, in the Book of Numbers,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 23.</i> takes chronological precedence over this section! Perhaps it is [indeed] so since it is placed near to that which it says there, <i>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 7:1.</i> [which was on the first of Nisan — “the eighth day” herein discussed].<br>It is possible to say that Aaron spread forth his hands towards heaven and blessed the people, just as Solomon did, as it is said, <i>And Solomon stood before the altar of the Eternal in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands, toward heaven</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 8:22.</i> and there it is said, <i>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying</i>, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 55.</i> Therefore Scripture does not mention that Moses commanded him to do so [i.e., to say the priestly blessing, since it had in fact not yet been given].<br>In the Beraitha<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 65.</i> of the section of consecration in the Torath Kohanim I have seen it said:<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Shemini</i> 30.</i> “<i>And he blessed them</i>. This is an unspecified blessing [the nature of which] you do not know. Scripture [therefore] went back and explained it further on: <i>The Eternal bless thee, and keep thee. The Eternal make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Eternal lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:24-26.</i> Nonetheless, I could still say that the Rabbis of this Beraitha were saying as follows: “This blessing with which Aaron blessed the people of his own accord, is unspecified, and Scripture did not explain to us what it was. But the blessing that the priests have been commanded to say in all future generations, has been expressly set forth, it applying to all priests alike forever. Or it may be that [the Rabbis of this Beraitha] are of the opinion that here He commanded him [to say] the priestly blessing for that day, and later on [as stated in the Book of Numbers] this blessing was given to Aaron and his sons for the succeeding generations.

Verse 1



Verse 2

AND THERE CAME FORTH FIRE ‘MILIPHNEI’ (FROM BEFORE) THE ETERNAL. The meaning of “<i>miliphnei</i> the Eternal” is like: “from before the <i>pnei</i> (presence of) the Eternal.” The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand, for I have already explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:1.</i> The nature of the sin of Nadab and Abihu you may know from that which it says, <i>and they offered ‘strange fire’ before the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1.</i> and it does not say “and they offered before the Eternal ‘incense’ which He had not commanded them.” Thus they put incense upon the fire, similarly to that which Scripture says, <i>they shall put incense ‘b’apecha’</i> (<i>before Thee</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 33:10. See following note.</i> and they directed their thoughts only to this,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In quoting the language of Ramban, Menachem of Ricanti adds the following explanatory note: “Know that the incense is offered towards the attribute of justice, as it is said, <i>they shall put incense ‘b’apecha’</i> (literally: ‘before Thy anger’). It is for this reason that the burning of incense stays the plague. (Numbers 17:11-15). However, the priest who offered it had to direct his mind to the perfect Unity of G-d. And since Nadab and Abihu directed it only to the attribute of justice (see Note 58), therefore they were punished.” See further, my Hebrew commentary p. 46.</i> and thus it was not <i>a fire-offering of a sweet savor</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:9, etc.</i> This is the sense of the expression, <i>and they laid ‘aleha’</i> (<i>upon her</i>) <i>incense</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1. The word <i>aleha</i> (upon her) is an allusion to the attribute of justice.</i> and it does not say “and they laid upon them [i.e., the censers] incense,” as is said with reference to the company of Korah, <i>and put fire therein, and put incense upon them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 16:7.</i> and again it is said there, <i>and put incense upon them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> But here it says <i>upon her</i>, to allude [to the fact] that they put the incense only on “the fire,” [and therefore it says], <i>And there came forth fire from before the Eternal, and devoured them</i>. It is possible that the verse which He said, <i>Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:9.</i> alludes to this, meaning that he should not cause it [the fire] to be strange. It is in connection with this that Scripture states, <i>when they</i> [Nadab and Abihu] <i>drew near before the Eternal, and died</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16: 1.</i> which means “when they offered <i>l’phanav</i> they died.”<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when they offered the incense <i>l’phanav</i> alone [to the attribute of justice alone, as explained above] they died.</i>

Verse 3

THIS IS THAT THE ETERNAL SPOKE, SAYING: ‘THROUGH THEM THAT ARE NIGH UNTO ME I WILL BE SANCTIFIED.’ “Where had He spoken this? In the verse, <i>and</i> [the Tent] <i>shall be sanctified ‘bichvodi’</i> (<i>by My Glory</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:43.</i> Do not read the word as <i>bichvodi</i> (by My Glory) but <i>bimechubodai</i> (through My honored ones). Moses said to Aaron: ‘My brother Aaron, I knew that this Sanctuary was to be hallowed by those who are beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He, and I thought that it would be either through me or through you. Now I see that your sons were holier<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In Rashi: “greater.”</i> than I and you.’” Thus the language of Rashi, based on the interpretation of our Rabbis. But if so, the verse, <i>and</i> [the Tent] <i>shall be sanctified ‘bichvodi’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:43.</i> means “that it will become holy in the eyes of all the people through my honored ones, and they will know that I dwell therein.”<br>Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra also wrote: “<i>This is that the Eternal spoke, saying</i>, means: G-d had already told me that He would show His sanctity through those that were near to Him. This is similar in meaning to the verse, <i>You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 3:2.</i> And when I will show them this holiness of Mine, then I will become glorified before all the people and they will fear Me.” But if this is so, then this is a statement not written [in the text], that G-d informed Moses of His ways and that such is the nature of His attribute!<br>In my opinion there is no need for all this. For by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the expression “G-d spoke” refers to His decrees, His thought, and the manner of His ways, and the term “speaking” is used with reference to all these [in humans]. Thus: <i>I spoke with my own heart</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 1:16.</i> means “I reflected on this thought.” <i>And this is ‘hadavar’ that Joshua did circumcise</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 5:4.</i> means “this is ‘the cause’ why Joshua did so.” ‘<i>Al d’var</i>’ (<i>because of</i>) <i>the money</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 43:18.</i> Similarly, <i>And let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the Eternal hath spoken</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:51.</i> means “as He hath decreed.” Likewise: <i>In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite built Jericho; with his firstborn he laid the foundation thereof, and with his youngest son Segub he set up the gates thereof; according to the word of the Eternal, which He spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 16:34. Here too, it does not mean “which G-d spoke,” since we nowhere find that He did say so, but “which He decreed.” Cf. the words of Joshua (Joshua 6:26).</i> Thus Moses said here: “This incident is that which G-d decreed, ‘saying to His heart': <i>Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified</i> so that they should not break forth into My sanctity; <i>and before all the people I will be glorified</i>, so that they treat My dwelling-place with respect.”
VAYIDOM AHARON’ (AND AARON WAS SILENT). This means that he had cried aloud, but then he became silent. Or perhaps the meaning thereof is as in the verse, <i>let not the apple of thine eye ‘tidom’</i> (<i>cease</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 2:18. Here then the meaning would be: “and Aaron ceased to shed tears.” According to the first interpretation, he was silent, not crying out aloud, but he still shed tears. But according to the second interpretation he was calmed completely.</i>

Verse 4

AND MOSES CALLED MISHAEL AND ELZAPHAN, THE SONS OF UZZIEL THE UNCLE OF AARON, AND SAID UNTO THEM: DRAW NEAR, CARRY YOUR BRETHREN FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY OUT OF THE CAMP. I have found written in the Torath Kohanim in the section of the consecration:<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Shemini</i> 38.</i> “Rabbi Eliezer says: the sons of Aaron died outside [the Sanctuary], in a place where the Levites [Mishael and Elzaphan] were permitted to enter, as it is said, <i>So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> If so, why then does it say, <i>and they died before the Eternal?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 2.</i> It was an angel who smote them [Nadab and Abihu] and thrust them out of the Sanctuary [and they did not die until they were outside it]. Rabbi Akiba says: they died inside the Sanctuary, as it is said, <i>and they died before the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 2.</i> If so, why does it say, <i>So they drew near, and carried them in their tunics</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> [since Levites are not permitted to enter the Sanctuary]? They put iron hooks on them, and dragged them and brought them out of the Sanctuary.” Thus far is the text of the Beraitha,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 65.</i> and the meaning thereof is as follows: Even though priests are also forbidden to enter the Sanctuary except at the time of Service,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, there is basically no difference between the priests and the Levites as far as the prohibition against a needless entry into the Sanctuary is concerned. If there is a need for it, such as removing an impure object from it, both are permitted [as explained further on in the text] to enter at any time. And if so, why the opinion of Rabbi Akiba that Mishael and Elzaphan put iron hooks on the bodies of Nadab and Abihu in order to remove them from the Sanctuary when they could have gone in directly and remove them? See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 66-67.</i> this prohibition applies only if they enter it needlessly. But one may enter the Sanctuary in order to remove an uncleanness, or to make Temple repairs. For thus we were taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 3:11.</i> “I might think one is not permitted to enter the Sanctuary to make the beaten plates [for a covering of the golden altar, or for the Holy of Holies]; Scripture therefore says, <i>‘Only’ he shall not go in unto the Veil</i><sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:23.</i> [the word ‘only’ denoting an exception to the general law]; such is their command: priests may go in there [at any time to make the above repairs]. If there are no priests present, Levites may enter. If there are no [ritually] pure ones [priests or Levites], impure ones may go in. If there are no unblemished ones, blemished ones may enter there.” Now on that day [when Nadab and Abihu died] there were no priests present [who could remove them from the Sanctuary where they had died], since [Aaron and his two remaining sons] were expressly commanded that they should not defile themselves for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7. — So the question appears: Why did Mishael and Elzaphan have to resort to the use of iron hooks when they could have entered the Sanctuary? The answer is: since it was possible etc.</i> But since it was possible to do it through dragging them out with iron hooks, [Mishael and Elzaphan] were not permitted to enter there. [Such is the opinion of Rabbi Akiba.] But Rabbi Eliezer, who is of the opinion [that an angel thrust Nadab and Abihu out of the Sanctuary, and they died outside, thinks] that since Scripture states of Mishael and Elzaphan, <i>so they drew near</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> it was outside the Sanctuary [that they died], and therefore he does not say [as does Rabbi Akiba] that they dragged them outside in their tunics. The meaning of the expression <i>in their tunics</i><sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> is that Nadab and Abihu were then dressed in the priestly garments. Moses thus commanded that they carry them <i>out of the camp</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> and there they should strip them of their priestly garments, and clothe them in burial shrouds, and bury them, as was their custom with other people who died in the desert. After that they purified the sacred garments and they were used by the other priests.

Verse 6

LET NOT THE HAIR OF YOUR HEADS GO LOOSE. “[This means]: do not grow your hair long. From this [the fact that Scripture forbade these particular mourners to let their hair grow long], we learn that a mourner is forbidden to cut his hair. [Moses thus said to them: Normally a mourner may not cut his hair], but you must not disturb the joy of G-d. THAT YE DIE NOT. But if you do this you shall die.” Thus far the language of Rashi.<br>Now that which Rashi says, “From this we learn that a mourner is forbidden to cut his hair,” is merely a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic enactment.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See in Exodus, <i>Seder Yithro</i>, p. 314, Note 449.</i> Moreover, according to this explanation one cannot then interpret: “But if you do this [i.e., you let your hair grow long] you shall die.” Rather<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s point is thus: Instead of Rashi’s interpretation — “<i>That ye die not</i>. But if you [the sons of Aaron] do this [i.e., let your hair grow long] you shall die” — the real explanation is as follows: “<i>That ye die not</i>. You need not fear death for <i>not</i> letting your hair grow long,” as other mourners would be so punishable if they would not let their hair grow.</i> it was optional in the case of Aaron’s sons, Scripture stating: “You are not <i>obliged</i> to let your hair grow long and rend your garments, as are other mourners; <i>that ye die not</i>, meaning that you will not be liable to death if you do so [i.e., neither let your hair grow nor rend your garments], but <i>other</i> mourners are liable [to death] if they fail to observe it.” Thus also have the Rabbis said in the Gemara of <i>Mashkin:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">This tractate of the Talmud is now called Moed Katan. The text referred to is found there, 24 a. <i>‘Mashkin’</i> is the name of the first chapter of the tractate. On the term Gemara see in Exodus, <i>Seder Bo</i>, p. 132, Note 204.</i> “A mourner who did not let his hair grow long, and did not rent his garments, is liable [to punishment of death], as it is said, <i>Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes, that ye die not;</i> but other mourners who do not let their hair grow long, or rend their garments, are liable [to that punishment].” But this text is similar to other Rabbinic laws for which the Talmud merely found a Scriptural support, for letting one’s hair grow long and rending one’s garments when in mourning are only matters of Rabbinic ordinance. Or perhaps the mourning of the first day [after the death and burial] is a law given to Moses at Sinai, being derived from that of <i>aninuth</i> [the state of mourning <i>before</i> the burial of a relative] according to the opinion of the Gaonim.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">See in Exodus, <i>Seder Ki Thisa</i>, p. 521, Note 74.</i><br>But the real meaning of the verse is an admonition to Aaron’s sons, and listen to the meaning thereof.

Accordingly, if the High Priest [on becoming apprised of the death of a near relative], leaves the Service and goes out of the Sanctuary whilst he is an <i>onen</i>, he is liable [to punishment] just like any [ordinary] priest who leaves the Service and goes as he pleases.<br>Now Moses warned Aaron here that he should not let his hair grow long, nor rend his garments, for this [negative] commandment applies to him [as High Priest] for all times.

Yet Moses warned them against doing all this as a special decision [“in order not to disturb the joy of G-d” on that occasion, as mentioned above by Rashi]. Therefore Moses charged Mishael and Elzaphan that <i>they</i> should defile themselves for the dead, and not the priests. He further commanded [the priests] not to let their hair grow, nor to rend their garments, just like their father, [who as High Priest was not permitted to do so], and not to cry at all. This is the meaning of the verse, <i>but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Eternal hath kindled</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> but not you. All this was in order not to disturb G-d’s joy [by their displaying signs of mourning]. He treated this strictly by making them liable to death [by the hand of Heaven] if they would disturb the joyous occasion in any way.<br>It is possible that Moses was commanded about this from the mouth of the Almighty, even though it is not expressly written, or that he derived it from that which he was commanded [to relay to Aaron and his sons for the seven days of consecration], <i>and ye shall keep the charge of the Eternal, that ye die not</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 8:35.</i> [from which Moses learned] that <i>the charge of the Eternal</i> includes also the eighth day.

Thus Aaron’s sons, too, did not perform the rites of the offerings on that day, as the Rabbis interpreted:<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 101 a.</i> “<i>And Aaron spoke unto Moses: Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 19.</i> Did they [i.e., my sons] then bring the offering — they who are ordinary priests? It was I [Aaron] that offered — I who am the High Priest [who may offer even when being an <i>onen</i>].” Now during this entire incident nothing [which was to be done during] the consecration was abolished, since the offerings had already been brought, and at night they all ate of the hallowed food which they were to eat. It is possible that this law applied to Elazar and Ithamar [Aaron’s remaining sons] all their lives, namely, that their laws be like those of the priest anointed for war [as mentioned above], because they had been anointed with the oil of anointment, this being the sense of the expression, [<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting …</i>] <i>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i><br>I have already mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">At the end of <i>Seder Tzav</i>, Verse 35.</i> the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 42.</i> which states: “<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> I might think that [on becoming apprised of the death of a near relative, an ordinary priest may not leave the Sanctuary] whether he is ministering or not; Scripture therefore says, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:12.</i> When is he not permitted to go out, so that [only by his staying there] he does not profane it?

If so, [the question appears]: how were they included in this warning [not to leave the Service and go out of the Sanctuary, when they were in fact doing no Service to begin with]? Perhaps we may say that Moses said to all of them, <i>and ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i> at the time of the Service, <i>lest ye die</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> and they knew that Aaron [as High Priest] could perform the rites of offering [although] an <i>onen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>onen</i> by law of the Torah is a mourner on the day of death of his relative whether before or after burial on that day.

It is for this reason that He said here in an unqualified manner, <i>and ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> and did not explain until when this [prohibition] applied, whether until the evening or the next day, since His intent was that they should not leave the Service, and this was to be a commandment applying to all generations.<br>It is possible that the command to the sons of Aaron was a special decision, that they should not go out from there on that day<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Having explained above that the admonition applied to Aaron’s sons not on that eighth day, but its effect began from the following day onwards, when they would be permitted to minister in the Sanctuary, Ramban now writes that it was possibly a special decision that even on that eighth day they should not leave the Sanctuary, just like their father, who, as High Priest, was permitted to bring offerings as an <i>onen</i> and was therefore prohibited from leaving the Sanctuary. This was to serve as a mark of honor and indication of the joyousness of the occasion.</i> [specifically], just as their father [could not leave], this being in honor of the joyous occasion [i.e., the culmination of the erection of the Tabernacle and inauguration of the priests], but ordinary priests throughout the generations are warned against leaving their Service on the basis of the verse which states, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:12.</i> which means that any priest who goes out of the Sanctuary and leaves his Service profanes it thereby. Thus the verse here [<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> is only necessary to derive the punishment, that whoever leaves the Service and goes out is subject to death [by the hand of Heaven], for it says, <i>for the anointing oil of the Eternal is upon you</i>, and that anointment is upon them for all generations, as it says, <i>and their anointing oil shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:15.</i> So also the Rabbis taught in the Beraitha of Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 28.</i> “From here the Rabbis have derived the principle that no mark of mourning whatever is shown for those executed by the court.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">“The analogy is not complete.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

DRINK NO WINE NOR STRONG DRINK. “[Do not drink] wine to such an extent that it has an intoxicating effect.” This is Rashi’s language. The meaning thereof is that if he paused during the drinking [of a fourth of a log of wine], or if he mixed a little water into it, he is free from punishment. The opinion of the Rabbi [Rashi] is thus that the priests were only prohibited from drinking wine, but not from other intoxicating drinks, the meaning of the term <i>sheichar</i> (strong drink) mentioned here being derived from the law of the Nazirite [where a similar expression appears,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>He shall abstain from wine and ‘sheichar’</i> (<i>strong drink</i>) (Numbers 6:3).</i> and only wine is forbidden to him].<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>sheichar</i> must not therefore be understood as strong drink [as it is found in all English translations], but rather as “strong wine.” The <i>vav</i> in the Hebrew <i>yayin v’sheichar</i> (literally: “wine <i>and</i> strong wine”) is thus to be understood as if it said <i>yayin k’shehu sheichar</i> — you must not drink “wine when it is strong wine,” or “when it is intoxicating” (Mizrachi). Rambam’s opinion, however, as mentioned further on in the text, is that <i>sheichar</i> means “strong drink,” and the priests were warned against both — wine and strong drink, although the punishment for violation was different for each.</i> This is correct according to my opinion. But in the opinion of Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon],<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Bi’ath Hamikdash</i> 1:2.</i> however, other intoxicating drinks are prohibited [through a negative commandment, without being punishable by death, and the Service performed after drinking them is not invalidated, whereas for drinking wine the punishment is death by the hand of Heaven, and the Service is invalidated]; thus <i>sheichar</i> is to be understood in its plain sense [i.e., strong drink]. The reason why this commandment was given at that time, was in order that the priest should not go astray through the intoxicating effect of wine, and thus come to entertain some improper thought which might cause his death, as happened to [Aaron’s] sons. It is possible that when the Rabbis interpreted<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 12:1.</i> that Nadab and Abihu died because they entered the Sanctuary whilst intoxicated by wine, they meant to say that it was because of the wine they had drunk that they erred in the matter of the strange fire,<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 1.</i> but not that their punishment actually was because they had drunk the wine, since they had not yet been warned against it. Rather, their punishment was because they erred with respect to the fire of G-d, as I have alluded to.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 1.</i>
WHEN YE GO INTO THE TENT OF MEETING. “From this verse I know only [that they are forbidden to drink wine and strong drink] when they go into the Sanctuary. Whence do I know that this applies also whenever they approach the altar? Entering the Tent of Meeting is mentioned here, and entering the Tent is also mentioned in connection with the washing of hands and feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</i> (Exodus 30:20).</i> Now just as there the Torah made approaching the altar similar to entering the Tent of Meeting, so here too it made approaching the altar like entering the Tent of Meeting.” This is Rashi’s language, and that of the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 1:4.</i><br>It would appear from this analogy that a priest [drunk with wine] is not liable to death for approaching the altar or for entering the Sanctuary, unless he performed there some [Divine] Service, just as in the case of washing the hands and feet, where the admonition is only against performing the Service [without washing], as it says, <i>or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</i> (Exodus 30:20).</i> In this form it is taught there in the Sifra:<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i> “Sifra” is another name for the Torath Kohanim. See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i>, Note 121.</i> “Rabbi<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">The redactor of the Mishnah, or as he is often known, <i>Rabbeinu Hakadosh</i>, “our holy teacher,” or simply “Rabbi.”</i> states: Here it says, <i>when ye go into the Tent of Meeting</i>, and there [in connection with the law of the priests washing their hands and feet] it says, <i>when they go into the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</i> (Exodus 30:20).</i> Now just as there He made going out [of the Sanctuary] similar to going into it,<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">If the priest who was in the Sanctuary touched something which necessitates washing of his hands and feet, or if he had given up his intent of doing any more ministration and then decides to do it, he must wash his hands and feet a second time, even though he is no longer, strictly speaking, “entering the Sanctuary,” since he is there already (Derech Hakodesh, commentary on the Sifra by Vidal Hatzarfati). See also my Hebrew commentary, p. 51, for a different commentary on this text by Rabad.</i> and the altar similar to the Tent of Meeting, and the penalty of death [by the hand of Heaven] is only if he performed the Service [without washing], so here also He made going out [of the Sanctuary] similar to going into it,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if he drank the wine whilst inside the Sanctuary and performed the Service, he is liable just like when he drank the wine outside the Sanctuary and entered it in a state of intoxication (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and the altar similar to the Tent of Meeting, and the punishment is only if he performs the Service [whilst intoxicated].” That is to say, the liability [to punishment] is only if the priest performs the Service, whether he entered while drunk, or drank there [after he had come in] and then performed some Service. There [in the Sifra]<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 1:5.</i> the Rabbis have said: “<i>It shall be a statute forever</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 9 before us.</i> This includes the pouring of oil [upon the flour of a meal-offering], mixing it, waving it, bringing near [the meal-offering to the altar], removing the handful and burning it, pinching a bird’s head, and sprinkling the blood,” [so that all these acts must not be done by the priest while drunk, and if he did any of them in that state, he is liable to death by the hand of Heaven]. For since Scripture stated, <i>to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote"><i>When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire-offering unto the Eternal</i> (Exodus 30:20).</i> [I might have excluded these acts from this law since they are not “a fire-offering”], therefore it was necessary to include them [here in the verse before us].<br>It further appears that this liability [to punishment] does not apply where one offers up on a <i>bamah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a high place.” This was an altar built prior to the establishment of a central Sanctuary, on which offerings to G-d could be brought; on such an altar even a non-priest could perform the rites of offering. <i>Bamoth</i> were permitted until the eighth day of consecration when the Tabernacle was erected, but from that day onwards they were prohibited until the people came into the Land of Israel, when for a period of fourteen years comprising the conquest and division of the Land, the Tabernacle was at Gilgal, and <i>bamoth</i> were temporarily permitted. Then a central Sanctuary was built at Shiloh, which lasted for 369 years, and during that time the <i>bamoth</i> were again prohibited. After the Philistines destroyed the Sanctuary at Shiloh, the <i>bamoth</i> were once again permitted. This period [covering also the reigns of Saul and David] lasted 57 years, and is known as that of Nob and Gibeon. Then finally the Sanctuary at Jerusalem was built, and from then on the <i>bamoth</i> were prohibited forever, since that is “the Eternal House,” so that even when it was destroyed, the place is still holy. — From this account it is thus clear why as stated in the Torath Kohanim [mentioned further on in the text] the central Sanctuary at Shiloh and “the Eternal House” at Jerusalem were alike as far as the prohibition to perform the Service while drunk is concerned. In both only a priest could perform the Service, while at a <i>bamah</i> even an Israelite was permitted to do it.</i> That is why the Rabbis said there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 1:5.</i> “From this verse I know only that it is prohibited [to perform the Service] in the Tent of Meeting [while drunk]. Whence do I know to include the Sanctuary at Shiloh and the Eternal House at Jerusalem? Scripture therefore says, <i>it shall be a statute for ever</i>.” For this prohibition applies to the priests performing their Services, and it was not necessary that it be a priest who performed the Service at a <i>bamah;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a high place.” This was an altar built prior to the establishment of a central Sanctuary, on which offerings to G-d could be brought; on such an altar even a non-priest could perform the rites of offering. <i>Bamoth</i> were permitted until the eighth day of consecration when the Tabernacle was erected, but from that day onwards they were prohibited until the people came into the Land of Israel, when for a period of fourteen years comprising the conquest and division of the Land, the Tabernacle was at Gilgal, and <i>bamoth</i> were temporarily permitted. Then a central Sanctuary was built at Shiloh, which lasted for 369 years, and during that time the <i>bamoth</i> were again prohibited. After the Philistines destroyed the Sanctuary at Shiloh, the <i>bamoth</i> were once again permitted. This period [covering also the reigns of Saul and David] lasted 57 years, and is known as that of Nob and Gibeon. Then finally the Sanctuary at Jerusalem was built, and from then on the <i>bamoth</i> were prohibited forever, since that is “the Eternal House,” so that even when it was destroyed, the place is still holy. — From this account it is thus clear why as stated in the Torath Kohanim [mentioned further on in the text] the central Sanctuary at Shiloh and “the Eternal House” at Jerusalem were alike as far as the prohibition to perform the Service while drunk is concerned. In both only a priest could perform the Service, while at a <i>bamah</i> even an Israelite was permitted to do it.</i> [therefore the prohibition did not apply there].<br>Now the meaning of the expression <i>when ye go into the Tent of Meeting</i>, is “when you perform Service,” and He used this expression because all the Services were done there, either inside the Tent or at the altar of the burnt-offering which was at the door of the Tent of Meeting. The general principle then, is that the prohibition and punishment in these matters are only to the effect that the priest should not perform the Service while drunk with wine or with hands and feet unwashed, likewise if he lacks any of the required priestly garments; but merely for entering the Sanctuary in these conditions, there is no prohibition in the Torah. Thus that which we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Keilim 1:9.</i> “Rabbi Yosei says: In five things is the space between the Porch [of the Sanctuary] and the altar equal to the Sanctuary: that those priests may not enter there who have a blemish, or who have dishevelled hair,<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">In our Mishnah: “or who have dishevelled hair, or who have drunk wine.”</i> or who have hands and feet unwashed” and the whole Mishnah there — all these are gradations of <i>Rabbinic</i> enactment [and are not matters prohibited by Scriptural law]. In the opinion, however, of Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon],<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Bi’ath Hamikdash</i> 1:15-16. See “The Commandments,” Vol. II pp. 68, 72-73.</i> one who [wilfully] enters the Sanctuary [in the above-mentioned conditions] without performing the Service, [has also violated] a negative commandment, for which the punishment is not death [by the hand of Heaven but whipping].

THE THIGH OF HEAVING AND THE BREAST OF WAVING. “This expression is similar to the verse, [<i>the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering</i>], <i>which is waved, and which is heaved up</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:27.</i> ‘Waving’ is an expression for moving to and fro [in a horizontal direction]. ‘Heaving’ is an expression for moving up and down. But why Scripture divided them, mentioning ‘heaving’ in connection with the thigh and ‘waving’ in connection with the breast, I do not know, for both of them [required] waving and heaving.” Thus far is the language of Rashi.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">This whole text of Rashi quoted by Ramban is missing in all standard versions of Rashi. It is found, however, in the Reggio edition of 1475, “Rashi’s Commentary to the Pentateuch.” This book incidentally was the first Hebrew book to appear in print. A facsimilie thereof has lately appeared in Jerusalem.</i><br>It appears to me that the reason for it is that during the [seven days of] consecration, the thigh was a heave-offering to G-d, being burned together with the bread and the fats,<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:22-25.</i> and that which is set aside from a peace-offering [to be burnt on the altar] is called “a heave-offering,” just as it is said, <i>And of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave-offering unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 7:14.</i> and [it follows] all the more so that these parts [of the ram of consecration] offered on the altar, were all “a heave-offering unto the Eternal.” [Hence the expression “the thigh of <i>heaving</i>.”] It was not called by the term “waving,” for that movement [to and fro in a horizontal direction] was done to the thigh together with the fats and the bread so as to burn them unto the Eternal. The breast, however, was waved by itself, and was only different from the rest of the meat [which was to be eaten by the priests] in that it was waved, and it was through this waving alone that it became sanctified and that Moses acquired it as his portion.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">It is so clearly stated in Exodus 29:26: <i>And thou</i> [Moses] <i>shalt take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before the Eternal; and it shall be thy portion</i>.</i> Now since the right of Aaron and his sons to the breast and thigh [of peace-offerings] in future generations was [derived] from the day of their consecration as priests, when they acquired the thigh through its being a heave-offering to G-d and the breast through its being waved, whilst the rest of the meat belonged to the owners, therefore the thigh was forever called [the thigh of] “heaving,” and the breast that of “waving,” as was done to them on the day of [the priests] acquiring their rights to them.
AL ISHEI HACHALAVIM’ (UPON THE FIRE-OFFERINGS OF THE FAT). “This is like: ‘upon the fat of the fire-offerings.’<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Since the fats are burnt with fire they are called “the fats of the fire,” not “the fire of the fats.” This comment is found in Rashi’s text as quoted by Mizrachi and other commentators. It is not in our printed texts of Rashi.</i> From here we learn that at the time of waving the fat-portions were beneath.” This is the language of Rashi. But there is no need for it [i.e., to invert the verse, and to derive this law from the verse here]. For the word <i>ishei</i> (“fire-offerings of”) is an adjectival-noun qualifying the word <i>chalavim</i> (fats), just as He said, <i>‘ishei Hashem’</i> (<i>the fire-offerings of the Eternal</i>) <i>and His inheritance they</i> [the priests] <i>shall eat</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:1. — Ramban’s intent is as follows: Rashi had inverted the expression in the verse before us because since the fats are burned with fire, they are called “the fats of the fire,” and not “the fire-offerings of the fats” as the verse literally has it. But Ramban quotes the above-mentioned verse from Deuteronomy to show that the word <i>ishei</i> does not have its precise meaning of “the fires of,” since the priests do not eat that which has actually been on the fire upon the altar. The word <i>ishei</i> must therefore be taken as an adjectival-noun for all offerings, since most of them are put upon the fire. Consequently the fats are not called <i>ishei</i> because of the fire, and the expression in the verse need not be inverted. — Ramban now proceeds to comment on the second point that Rashi made, namely that from the verse here we learn that the fat-portions were at the bottom at the time of waving.</i> The explanation of this verse is that it constitutes a reason for that which He said [in the preceding verse], <i>for they</i> [the offerings] <i>are given as thy due, and thy sons’ due, out of the offerings of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> [With reference to this] He now said, <i>The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they</i> — that is, the children of Israel, mentioned [in the previous verse] — <i>bring upon the fire-offerings of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before the Eternal</i>, that they [i.e., the thigh and the breast] be hallowed before Him, and they <i>shall be thine and thy sons’ with thee, as a due forever</i>. For this is not the place of the command concerning the waving,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">It is above, 7:30. See Ramban <i>ibid.</i></i> but incidentally<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi therefore should not have written, “From here we learn etc.,” as it is not from here that we learn it, since the law of waving is mentioned elsewhere; here it is mentioned only incidentally.</i> we learn that at the time of waving the fats were beneath the others.

Verse 16

AND MOSES DILIGENTLY INQUIRED FOR THE GOAT OF THE SIN-OFFERING, AND BEHOLD, IT WAS BURNT. “This was the he-goat of the Additional Offerings of the New Moon.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:15. — The eighth day on which all the events described here, took place was the first of Nisan, the New Moon.</i> Three he-goats for sin-offerings were offered up that day: [the people’s sin-offering brought especially on that day, as it is said], <i>Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 9:3.</i> and the he-goat brought by Nachshon [in honor of the dedication of the altar],<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 7:16.</i> and the he-goat for the New Moon.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:15. — The eighth day on which all the events described here, took place was the first of Nisan, the New Moon.</i> Of all these, it was only the he-goat for the New Moon that was burnt [although ordinarily it would have been eaten by the priests]. The Sages of Israel differed regarding the reason why it was burnt. Some say that it was burnt on account of some impure object that touched it, and some say it was burnt on account of the mourning [of Aaron’s sons].” All this is the language of Rashi.<br>It is in accordance with the opinion of those<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon (Zebachim 101 a).</i> who say that it was burnt on account of some impure object that touched it, that the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote on the verse, “<i>and if I had eaten of the sin-offering ‘today’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19. These are Aaron’s words to Moses in defense of his sons having burnt the sin-offering, saying, <i>and if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of the Eternal</i>? Now it is on the word “today” that Rashi comments: “by day etc.”</i> — by ‘day’ it was forbidden to eat thereof, but in the case of an <i>onen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>onen</i> by law of the Torah is a mourner on the day of death of his relative whether before or after burial on that day. [On the night following he is an <i>onen</i> by law of the Rabbis. If burial has not taken place on the day of death he continues to be an <i>onen</i> by law of the Rabbis. When burial finally takes place he is an <i>onen</i> by law of the Rabbis even after burial, but at night he is no longer considered an <i>onen</i> at all.] An <i>onen</i> is to be distinguished from an <i>avel</i> who is a mourner for a period of seven or thirty days. The laws of mourning as affecting the Divine Service in the Tabernacle and its holy offerings relate to the priest when he is an <i>onen</i>.</i> on the night [following the death and burial] it is permitted [to eat the offering], since the [Scriptural] law of the <i>onen</i> applies only to the <i>day</i> of burial.” Accordingly, if it was burnt on account of mourning, they should have [left it to be] eaten at night! We must perforce say that those Rabbis [who say that it was burnt on account of mourning] are of the opinion that the [Scriptural] law of an <i>onen</i> [forbidding him to eat an offering] applies even on the night following the burial! [Therefore Aaron’s defense of his sons’ action in burning the sin-offering was correct, since they could not have eaten of it even at night. But Rashi, who is of the opinion that an <i>onen</i> may eat the offering at night, must hold that the reason why they burnt it, was on account of some impure object which touched the offering, as a result of which it could never be eaten, and hence Aaron’s defense of them was completely correct.]

Verse 19

AND AARON SPOKE UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD, THIS DAY HAVE THEY OFFERED. “What did Aaron mean to say by this? But [the explanation is]: Moses had said to them: ‘Perhaps you sprinkled the blood of [the sin-offering of the New Moon] whilst you were <i>onenim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>onen</i> by law of the Torah is a mourner on the day of death of his relative whether before or after burial on that day.

The laws of mourning as affecting the Divine Service in the Tabernacle and its holy offerings relate to the priest when he is an <i>onen</i>.</i> and an <i>onen</i> who performs the Service invalidates [the offering, and therefore you burnt it]?’ To this Aaron replied [that Moses should not be angry with his sons]: ‘Did <i>they</i> bring the offerings [on that day] — they who are ordinary priests? It was I that offered — and I, as High Priest, am permitted to offer when an <i>onen</i>.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">The reason, Aaron continued, why the sin-offering was burnt, is because there is a difference between <i>occasional</i> [such as the people’s sin-offering brought on that particular day, and the sin-offering of Nachshon, prince of the tribe of Judah — see Numbers 7:16] and offerings that are obligatory for all generations [such as the sin-offering of the New Moon]. “If you [Moses] have been commanded that the occasional offerings be eaten by the priests even while they are <i>onenim</i>, you cannot apply this leniency in the case of offerings that are obligatory for all generations.” As Verse 20 states, Moses was well-pleased with this answer, and as explained by Rashi, he was not ashamed to admit his error.</i> This is Rashi’s language. So too is it found in the Gemara [of Tractate Zebachim], in the Chapter <i>Tebul Yom:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “One who [having incurred some impurity] immersed himself [in an immersion-pool] on that day,” but must wait for sunset to be perfectly pure. — In passing it may be noted that in the time of Ramban all texts of the Talmud were in manuscript form, and page numbers were unknown. A reference to any particular place in the Talmud had to be made on the basis of the name of the chapter. Hence Ramban’s expression here: “and so it is in the Gemara, in the Chapter <i>Tebul Yom</i>.”</i> [Moses said to Aaron’s sons]: “But perhaps you offered it [while you were <i>onenim</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">An <i>onen</i> by law of the Torah is a mourner on the day of death of his relative whether before or after burial on that day.

The laws of mourning as affecting the Divine Service in the Tabernacle and its holy offerings relate to the priest when he is an <i>onen</i>.</i> and thus you invalidated it.”<br>But I wonder! For all the offerings were brought before they became mourners, as it is written, <i>and he</i> Aaron] <i>came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 9:22.</i> and afterwards they entered the Tent of Meeting<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 23.</i> and prayed, following which there came forth the fire [that consumed] the offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> and only then did Nadab and Abihu offer up this incense!<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1 in this chapter.</i> [So how could Moses have thought that Elazar and Ithamar had performed the Service while they were mourners because of the death of their brothers, since their death occurred only <i>after</i> the performing of the Service!]<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">The Tur answers Ramban’s question by pointing out that the verse in 9:23 speaks only of the particular offerings that were brought especially on that day, but mentions nothing of the sin-offering of the New Moon, obligatory for all generations. That offering had not yet been brought, and Moses therefore properly questioned them on it.</i> Perhaps Moses had not seen their acts, and was therefore afraid that they may have found the blood of this sin-offering [of the New Moon] which had not yet been sprinkled [upon the altar], and that they sprinkled it. So Aaron told Moses: “The sprinkling was to be done by me, and when it was [in fact] sprinkled, it was done by my hand and thus the offering did not become invalidated by mourning [since the High Priest may bring offerings even when an <i>onen</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">And as to the reason why the offering was burnt, see above, Note 141.</i> But the whole discussion [between Moses and Aaron] was theoretical, for nothing at all was done while they were in a state of mourning [since all the offerings had in fact been brought before the death of Nadab and Abihu].

Chapter 11



Verse 1

AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND TO AARON, SAYING UNTO THEM: 2. SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The commandments [mentioned] in these sections apply to both Israelites and the priests, but their subject-matter affects mostly the priests, for they must always guard themselves from touching impure objects, since they have to come into the Sanctuary and eat the hallowed food [which they may not do when they are impure]. Moreover, when an Israelite errs in these matters, he has to bring an offering [to effect atonement for his transgression],<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 5:2.</i> which the priests offer up. Furthermore, He commanded them, <i>And that ye may put difference between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 10:10. It should be noted at this point that the terms “clean” or “cleanness,” and “unclean” or “uncleanness,” are here in the translation used interchangeably with those of “pure” or “purity” and “impure” or “impurity”. This was felt necessary in order to convey the thought that uncleanness in the Biblical sense is not something that can be rubbed off with some material object. On the other hand, the terms “pure” and “impure” suggest a far greater measure of spirituality. The same comment applies equally to the following portions of the Torah — <i>Tazria, Metzora</i>, etc.</i> thus they must instruct Israel concerning the impure and the pure so that they can be careful of them. It was for this reason that the communication about these laws came to both Moses and Aaron, or to Moses to say to Aaron, commanding both of them, <i>speak unto the children of Israel</i>, and this is the reason why these laws were said in the Book of the Laws of the Priests [i.e., this Book of Leviticus]. In this section He also warns against eating impure foods, so as not to defile the Tabernacle and its hallowed things.

Verse 2

AMONG ALL THE BEASTS THAT ARE ON THE EARTH. The plain meaning thereof is “among all the beasts that are on ‘the face of the earth,” the expression being similar to “all the beasts that are in the world.” But the interpretation of the Rabbis is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 2:6.</i> Since there are creatures in the sea whose law does not depend on these signs, but is like that of the fish, therefore He said, <i>that are on the earth</i>, excluding what is in the sea.

Verse 3

WHATSOEVER PARTETH THE HOOF, AND IS WHOLLY CLOVEN-FOOTED, AND CHEWETH THE CUD, AMONG THE BEASTS; THAT MAY YE EAT. The meaning of this verse is that every animal which has these two signs, you may eat, but you may not eat it if it has only one sign. Now it would have been proper if He would merely state the law in this general way. However, He singled out the camel, the rock-badger, and the hare<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 4-6.</i> as having only the one sign of chewing the cud, and the swine as having the one sign of a parted hoof,<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> because there are no other animals in the world that have only one sign. He then repeated [as a general rule applying to those with no sign at all, and those with only one sign], <i>Of their flesh ye shall not eat</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8. This is Ramban’s concluding opinion, that the verse applies to both — those animals having no sign at all, and the four mentioned as having only one sign. Ramban proceeds to show that from Rashi’s text it would appear that this verse applies only to the four mentioned animals, while the prohibition against those having no sign at all is derived from another source. This explanation Ramban differs from in the text which follows.</i> which denotes a negative commandment.<br>Now Rashi wrote: “From this verse I know only about these [four animals mentioned]. Whence do I know that other unclean animals that have no signs of purity, may not be eaten? You derive it by the rule of <i>kal vachomer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a conclusion drawn from minor to major. See in Exodus, <i>Seder Bo</i>, p. 133, Note 208, for further explanation.</i> How is it with these four animals mentioned, that have some of the signs of purity? They are forbidden! [It follows all the more so that those which have none of the signs, are surely forbidden to be eaten!]” In the words of the Sifra:<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 3:2.</i> “What is the law concerning those animals that have some of the signs of purity? They are forbidden to be eaten by a negative commandment. Is it not logical that other unclean animals which have none of the characteristics of purity, should be forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment! Thus we find that the camel, the rock-badger, the hare and the swine are explicitly forbidden by Scripture, whilst the other impure animals are forbidden on the strnegth of a <i>kal vachomer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a conclusion drawn from minor to major. See in Exodus, <i>Seder Bo</i>, p. 133, Note 208, for further explanation.</i> It is also established that the positive commandment [regarding unclean animals] is Scriptural,<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote"><i>These ye may eat</i> (Verse 2). From this we deduce the converse, negative commandment, that any animal which does <i>not</i> have these two characteristics of a permissible animal, is not allowed as food; and a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment has the force of a positive commandment. Hence one who eats an impure animal violates both a positive commandment [<i>these ye may eat</i>, as explained above], and negative commandment [<i>of their flesh ye shall not eat</i>], See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 167-168).</i> while the negative commandment regarding them is derived from a <i>kal vachomer</i>.” Thus far is the text of the Beraitha.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 3:2.</i><br>But in my opinion this is not in accordance with the conclusion of the discussions in the Talmud. For if so, one would not be liable to whipping for eating of all the other unclean animals [which have <i>none</i> of the characteristics of purity], and which are forbidden only on the strength of a <i>kal vachomer</i>, for a law derived from logical argument is not one for which punishment can be administered.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Makkoth 5 b.</i> Thus the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 10:10-11.</i> with respect to [having intercourse with] one’s sister, which Scripture prohibited if she is <i>the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 18:9.</i> that it was necessary to find a Scriptural reference prohibiting one’s sister if she be the daughter of both one’s father and mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">This was found in the redundant expression, <i>he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 20:17).</i> even though that prohibition might have been derived from a <i>kal vachomer</i>[for if the Torah prohibited a sister who is the daughter of either one’s father or one’s mother, surely she is prohibited] if she be the daughter of both one’s father and mother! [But the special Scriptural reference was necessary to teach us the principle] that a law derived from logical argument is not one for which punishment can be administered, as is stated in Tractate Yebamoth, Chapter <i>Keitzad</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “How come …” Yebamoth 22 b. — See above, at end of Note 142.</i> But this Beraitha [quoted by Rashi] may either be in accordance with the opinion of the Sages who say that a law derived from a logical argument <i>is</i> one for which punishment can be administered, as stated in Tractate Sanhedrin,<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">The name of the Sage is Rabbi Shimon (Sanhedrin 86 a). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 54.</i> or it cannot be satisfactorily explained.<br>Now the reason why whipping is [in fact] incurred for eating unclean beasts [which have none of the characteristics of purity, since they are only derived through a <i>kal vachomer</i>], is because Scripture states in connection with the rock-badger that it is prohibited because it <i>parteth not the hoof</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5. Thus, Scripture having stated <i>the reason why</i> the rock-badger is forbidden as food, it follows that any animal to which the same reason applies, is likewise forbidden on the strength of that verse, and not because of some other logical reasoning.</i> and in connection with the swine, because it <i>cheweth not the cud</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> This being the case, any animal that does not chew the cud or have a parted hoof is included in the terms of this prohibition, and there is no need at all to derive them from a <i>kal vachomer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a conclusion drawn from minor to major. See in Exodus, <i>Seder Bo</i>, p. 133, Note 208, for further explanation.</i>
THESE MAY YE EAT. “But not an unclean animal. Has it not already been forbidden by means of a negative commandment? But [this verse is stated] so that [if he eats of it] he transgresses both a positive and a negative commandment.” This is Rashi’s language, and so it is found in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 3:1.</i><br>Now Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] said<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Ma’acholoth Asuroth</i> 2:3.</i> that this verse is in order to forbid human flesh – “<i>these may ye eat</i>, but not human flesh. Thus the flesh and the milk are forbidden by means of a positive commandment.” But we have not found such an interpretation by our Rabbis. Perhaps he [Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] thought this to be the case because of that which we have learned there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 4:4.</i> “I might think that the flesh of those that walk on two legs and the milk of those that walk on two legs should also be forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment? Therefore Scripture says: <i>These ye shall not eat</i> — these are forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment, but the flesh of those that walk on two legs and the milk of those that walk on two legs are not forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment.” From this text the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] may have deduced that they are not forbidden by means of a negative commandment, but are forbidden by means of a positive commandment, and he derived it from the verse: <i>these may ye eat</i>.<br>But the matter is not so. For our Rabbis have clearly said in connection with the blood of those that walk on two legs<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Kerithoth 21 b. Hence if one’s teeth are bleeding he may suck the blood and not be afraid of having committed a sin.</i> and the milk of those that walk on two legs<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Such as milk of the human breast (<i>ibid.</i>, 22 a).</i> that there is not even a commandment to abstain from eating them by Rabbinical enactment. If the flesh thereof would be prohibited [by Scriptural law], then [the blood and milk thereof would also be prohibited in accordance with the general rule]: “anything that comes out of that which is impure, is also impure.”<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Bechoroth 5 b.</i> The blood of crawling reptiles and that of human beings the Sages have excluded from the prohibition against blood, and they have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Kethuboth 60 a.</i> “The blood of the crawling reptile is like its flesh, and one incurs whipping for eating a crawling reptile,” meaning that it is <i>not</i> forbidden as blood [for the wanton violation of which one incurs excision]; thus they made it like flesh [but we find no such statement in connection with human blood]. Rather, when they said that there is no negative commandment against eating them, they meant to say that you cannot exclude them on the basis of it [i.e., on the basis of a <i>specific</i> Scriptural verse], and they are thus permitted. According to my opinion, however, this only applies to flesh [or blood] of a live person [which can not be prohibited on the basis of a definitive verse and hence if a person’s teeth are bleeding he may suck the blood thereof and not be afraid of having committed a sin].<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">However, if blood appears on the bread which he is eating he must first remove the blood stains from the bread before continuing to eat it in order to avoid the semblance of wrong-doing, since people might think that it is from the blood of an animal (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> However, the Rabbis have learned in connection with a corpse by means of an analogous use of words found when speaking of it and of the heifer whose neck is broken<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 21:4.</i> that it is forbidden to have any benefit from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah 29 b. Thus Ramban agrees with Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam) that the matters under discussion are forbidden, the difference of opinion among them being only as to which law is violated. It is a rule in the administration of punishment that the violator of the law must have been pre-warned by witnesses of the <i>specific</i> prohibition entailed and the punishment to which the violator would be subject to by the hand of the court. Ramban and Rambam thus differ as to the nature of the prohibition the violator must be reminded of, in order that he be punishable by the court.</i>

V’ETH HA’ARNEVETH’ (AND THE HARE). This is a species of which both the male and female are so called in the Sacred Language, [although the word itself is feminine]. A similar case is <i>haya’anah</i> (the ostrich)<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16.</i> [although the actual word is feminine in form, both male and female are indicated]. In fowls [a word of the same structure is] <i>yonah</i> (a pigeon), the name for the male not being different from that of the female. [On the other hand], there are many [animal species] the names of which are masculine in form, while their females have no specific name, such as <i>gamal</i> (camel), <i>shafan</i> (rock-badger), <i>chazir</i> (swine), <i>‘dov oreiv’</i> (<i>a bear lying in wait</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 3:10. The verb-form clearly shows that the word <i>dov</i> is masculine in form.</i> <i>‘parah v’dov tir’enah’</i> (<i>the cow and the bear shall feed</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 11:7. The verse clearly indicates that while <i>parah</i> is feminine in form, and <i>dov</i> is masculine in form, it nonetheless refers also to the female, as is shown by the feminine form of the verb <i>tir’enah</i>.</i> A similar case amongst fowls is the word <i>tor</i> (turtle-dove) [which, though masculine in form, denotes also the female]. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <i>‘shtei’</i> (<i>two</i>) <i>turtle-doves, or ‘shnei’</i> (<i>two</i>) <i>young pigeons</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Above 5:7.</i> thus mentioning [the feminine form] <i>shtei</i> with reference to <i>torim</i> (turtle-doves) which is masculine in form, and [the masculine <i>shnei</i>] with reference to <i>yonah</i> (the young pigeon) [which is feminine in form], in order to inform us that there it does not matter which of them [one brings as an offering, whether male or female]. Do not refute me from the expressions of our Rabbis who say: “cow and <i>chazirah</i> (sow);”<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Bechoroth 28 b. Thus it seems that there is a special term for the female of the swine <i>chazirah</i>, as opposed to the masculine <i>chazir</i> in Verse 7.</i> “a camel born of a <i>gamlah</i> (a she-camel),”<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6 b. Here too, the Rabbis use a special term for the female of the camel.</i> for these are terms they improvised from similar forms in the language in order to make their intent clear. Now the reason why these four animals [the camel, rock-badger, hare, and swine] are forbidden [to be eaten] is that they do not have the two characteristics of purity.

Verse 7



Verse 8

AND THEIR CARCASSES YE SHALL NOT TOUCH. This is not a prohibition [saying that] we are not to touch these carcasses [of the animals that we are forbidden to eat]. Rather, Scripture states, <i>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</i>, for <i>they are unclean to you</i>, meaning to say, “you cannot touch them without becoming unclean.” The meaning thereof is to state that all those who touch them should be aware that they have become unclean and should therefore be careful not to enter the Sanctuary nor [to eat] of the hallowed offerings. Perhaps the meaning of the interpretation which our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 16 b.</i> “<i>And their carcasses ye shall not touch</i> — on a festival” is to say that “you should not touch them at a time when you want to be clean, for they are unclean [and by touching them you will also become unclean] and you will not be able to go up to the Sanctuary on the festival.” But the [mere] act of touching them is not forbidden by means of a negative commandment, for he who touches carrion [even] on a festival does not incur whipping [by law of the Torah]. Thus that which the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 16 b.</i> “One is dutybound to purify oneself on a festival,” is a commandment of Rabbinic authority, there being according to Scriptural law neither a positive nor a negative commandment, concerning the touching of carrion, except that of going up to the Sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 60-61.</i> Or it may be that the interpretation,<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 16 b.</i> “<i>And their carcasses ye shall not touch</i> — on a festival,” is a Scriptural text used as a support for the Rabbinical enactment,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See in Exodus, <i>Seder Yithro</i>, p. 314, Note 449.</i> like many other laws of the Sages taught there in the Torath Kohanim, which use Biblical texts as a “support.” It is also taught there:<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 2:6.</i> “Other Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">According to tradition, Rabbi Meir is quoted under this anonymous term <i>Acheirim</i> (others). See Horayoth 13 b, for the reason of this name.</i> say: One might think that if a person touches a carcass [he violates a negative commandment and] is liable to whipping? Scripture therefore says, <i>By these ye shall become unclean</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 24.</i> From this one might think that if a person sees a carcass he must go and render himself unclean by [touching] it? Scripture therefore says, <i>and their carcasses ye shall not touch</i>. How are we to reconcile these two verses? We must conclude that [touching a carcass] is optional” [i.e., neither obligatory, nor forbidden]. This is the main principle of the Scriptural law.

Verse 9

SNAPIR V’KASKESES’ (FINS AND SCALES). “<i>Snapirim</i> — these are what [the fish] swim with. <i>Kaskeses</i> — these are the scales attached to [the body of the fish].” This is Rashi’s language, and so also it is found in the Gemara of Tractate Chullin.<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 59 a.</i> But you should not [be led to] understand from their language that these scales are really [inflexibly] fixed to their bodies and attached to the skin of the fish [so that they do not come off at all]. Rather, they are called “fixed” because they do not move to and fro from the fish, nor do they quiver as do the fins. They are the round coverings, the plates of which are like finger-nails, and they can be removed from the skin of the fish by hand or knife. But those [scales] which are fixed and attached to the skin of the fish and cannot be removed from the skin at all, are not <i>kaskeses</i> (scales), and the fish [which has them] is prohibited food. It is for this reason that the Sages in the Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 66 b. See in Exodus, <i>Seder Bo</i>, p. 132, for meaning of the word “Gemara.”</i> said that “<i>Kaskeses</i> is the cover of the fish.” In the words of the Tosephta:<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta Chullin 3:27. See above, Note 101 for meaning of the term “Tosephta.”</i> “The <i>kaskasim</i> are those [objects] which cover the fish, and the <i>snapirim</i> are those with which the fish moves.” This is also the translation of Onkelos, who rendered the word <i>kaskeses</i> as <i>klippin</i>, [which means literally “shells”], for they are the “shells” of the fish which can be taken off and peeled away like the bark of trees and the peel of fruits. Such is also the meaning of the verse stating, <i>and he</i> [Goliath] <i>was clad with a coat of ‘kaskasim’</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 17:5.</i> for all their [war-] coats were made of rings, and some people made “scales” in them in order to close up the openings of the rings, so that thin arrows should not be able to penetrate them, and it was those “scales” that were called <i>kaskasim</i>. The Sages also mentioned them in the Gemara [Tractate Sanhedrin] in the Chapter <i>Cheilek:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “A share” — “All Israel have a share in the World to Come” — Sanhedrin 95 b. The reference there is to Sennacherib, king of Assyria, who brought to his siege of Jerusalem countless thousands of trained soldiers “all dressed in coats of mail etc.”</i> “Dressed in coats of mail made with scales.” Now Jonathan the son of Uziel<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis, Vol. I, p. 127, Note 152.</i> translated [in the above-mentioned verse concerning Goliath that he was clad with] “a coat of <i>galbin</i>,” this being of the expression, <i>the razor of ‘hagalabim,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 5:1.</i> which are “leather workers.” [By so translating, Jonathan thus] intended to say that the covering at the openings of the rings in this coat of mail was like that of the scales on a skin of a fish, as they used to boil hard skin and cover the coats of armor with them, a practice they do to this day. Understand this.<br>The reason why fins and scales [are signs of permissibility as food] is that those fish which have them always dwell in the upper clear waters, and they are sustained through the air that enters there. Therefore their bodies contain a certain amount of heat which counteracts the abundance of moistness [of the waters], just as wool, hair and nails function in man and beast. Those fish which have no fins and scales always dwell in the lower turbid waters, and due to the great abundance of moistness and gatherings of water there, they cannot repel anything. Hence they are creatures of cold fluid,<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i>, Note 264.</i> which cleaves to them and is therefore more easily able to cause death, and it [the cold fluid] does in fact cause death in some waters, such as stagnant lakes.

Verse 10

OF ALL THAT SWARM (‘SHERETZ’) IN THE WATERS, AND OF ALL THE LIVING CREATURES THAT ARE IN THE WATERS. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that <i>sheretz</i> (“swarming” things) are the small species that are born [and bred] in the waters, while “the living creatures” are the species of male and female. But in my opinion the term <i>‘sheretz’ that swarm in the waters</i> denotes the fish which swim in the waters, for every expression of <i>sheretz</i> means movement, and the term <i>all the living creatures that are in the waters</i>, refers to the sea-animals, some of which have legs which they walk upon like creatures of the field. Thus there is one law alike for all of them [namely that those which do not have fins and scales are forbidden to be eaten]. The interpretation of the Torath Kohanim is:<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 4:7.</i> “<i>Living</i>, this denotes the sea-animal. <i>Creature</i>, this includes the siren. I might think that its carcass conveys impurity in a tent [like that of a human body], as Ben Chachinai indeed says? Scripture therefore says [in the verse before us], <i>they are detestable</i>” [as food, but they do not convey impurity to a person who comes into the tent where their carcass lies].<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">See my Hebrew commentary p. 57, Note 56, for another reading in the Torath Kohanim at this concluding point.</i>

Verse 11

AND THEIR CARCASSES YE SHALL HAVE IN DETESTATION. “This includes [in the category of forbidden food] <i>yavchushin</i> which have been filtered [through water]. <i>Yavchushin</i> are insects called <i>mousclions</i><sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">In our Rashi: <i>moucherons</i>. — A native of France, Rashi explained many Scriptural and Talmudic terms in the French language of his times. These words of the old French language have indeed been an invaluable source of knowledge to students of the development of the French language.</i> in [old] French.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But I wonder about it! For this species [of <i>mousclions</i>] always comes out of wine, and flies about in the air and rests on the earth, and even while still in the air [before creeping upon the earth] it is already forbidden [as food], as we say [in Tractate Chullin] in the Chapter <i>Eilu Treifoth:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">“These are accounted as <i>treifah</i> animals” [so that they may not be eaten]. Chullin 67b. See in the Book of Exodus, <i>Seder Mishpatim</i>, p. 373, Note 189.</i> “Rav Yoseif raised the question: [if an insect which grew in a fruit] flew off into the air [and before it rested on the earth, was swallowed knowingly by a person] what is the law regarding it?”<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Shall we say that since it was <i>capable</i> of creeping upon the earth it is termed “a swarming thing that swarms upon the earth” and thus forbidden by Scripture as food or maybe it is only forbidden if it has <i>actually</i> swarmed upon the earth?</i> How much more so that it is forbidden when it rests continually all day upon vessels and upon the earth far away from the wine cellar, for it is already called <i>a swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 41.</i> Rather, that species [mentioned by Rashi as <i>mousclions</i>] is called <i>yitush</i> (mosquito) — and breeds in wine, as the Rabbis have said in the tradition concerning the wicked Titus,<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">“The wicked Titus” was the Roman general who burnt the Second Temple, whose punishment in this world was, as the Midrash tells: “They poured him a cup of wine, and the Holy One, blessed be He, prepared for him one <i>yitush</i> (mosquito) which entered into his nostrils” and plagued him all his life (Vayikra Rabbah 22:2). Thus it is clear that the <i>yitush</i> breeds in wine: See Gittin 56 b for a full account of this mosquito in Titus’ brain.</i> [and is not the <i>yavchushin</i> of our verse]. But the <i>yavchushim</i> which are mentioned here [by Rashi, on the basis of the Torath Kohanim] is a species which is concealed in water, and one searches for it with a ladle and removes it, [the term <i>yavchushim</i> being] of the expression:<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 156 a. See my Hebrew commentary p. 57, that the reading in our text of the Gemara there, is different [namely, “All authorities agree that one is permitted to stir etc.”], and the exact source of Ramban’s quotation is unknown to me.</i> “<i>Ein bochashin</i> (one may not stir) a drink prepared of flour mixed with honey on the Sabbath.” And in the Gemara of Tractate Zebachim, in the second chapter, [Resh Lakesh] said:<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 22 a.</i> “All things which serve to fill up the required measure of an immersion-pool, may also serve to fill up the water in the laver [from which the priests washed their hands and feet before ministering in the Sanctuary];<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">The required measure of water for an immersion-pool is for [[illegible]] seahs. The laver had to have enough water in it for four priests to be able to wash their hands and feet at the same time.</i> but they do not serve to fill up the required measure of one fourth of a log of water [for the washing of hands].” On this [saying of Resh Lakesh] the Rabbis asked: “[What did Resh Lakesh mean to exclude by saying that ‘they’ do not fill up the required measure of water for the washing of hands]? Shall we say that he meant to exclude red <i>yavchushim</i>? In that case even if the immersion-pool is full of them, it is also valid!<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Resh Lakesh who used the expression <i>mashlim</i> (fill up), which implies merely a completion of measure by some addition, could therefore not have referred to these <i>yavchushim</i>, since even if the pool is composed entirely of them, it is also valid for immersion! — For Ramban’s intent in quoting this text, see further, Note 206.</i> For we are taught [in a Beraitha]: Rabban<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">The title “Rabban” (“our Rabbi” — instead of “Rabbi”) indicates that the person was the <i>Nasi</i> (head) of the Sanhedrin.</i> Shimon the son of Gamaliel says: Whatever originates from water, one may immerse oneself therein [to be rendered ritually pure],” and red <i>yavchushim</i> is a species which originates from water [therefore Resh Lakesh could not have intended them, when he gave his rule excluding certain objects from being valid for <i>completing</i> the required measure of one fourth of a log for the washing of hands].<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it is clearly shown that <i>yavchushim</i> are found in water, and Rashi’s comment that <i>yavchushim</i> are those insects called [in old French] <i>mousclions</i> is therefore incorrect, since these germinate in wine, and in Hebrew they are called <i>yitushim</i>, while <i>yavchushim</i> germinate in water.</i> Similarly there are always found in the sediment of wine very white worms which are formed from the thickness of the wine, and which people filter, [and these are akin to the <i>mousclions</i> mentioned by Rashi].<br>Now I have seen in Rashi’s commentaries there [in Tractate Zebachim]<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 22 a.</i> that he wrote: “Red <i>yavchushim</i>, these are a sort of wingless <i>yitushim</i> (mosquitoes) just like the small <i>yavchushim</i> which germinate at the bottom of our barrels of wine on the outside; and they are also formed in water.” Perhaps it is this wingless species [of insects] which can only be removed from water through a filtering process, that Rashi refers to here [in his commentary to the Torah, when referring to <i>yavchushim</i> as <i>mousclions</i>], since in his vernacular these water-insects were also called by that name [not only the ones produced in wine]. However, in his commentary to Tractate Chullin<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 67 a.</i> Rashi wrote: ‘<i>Yavchushim</i>, these are like small <i>yitushim</i> (mosquitoes) found in wine-cellars,” [and he mentioned nothing concerning the <i>yavchushim</i> which are created in water; hence in his commentary here on the Torah, Rashi, in speaking of <i>yavchushim</i>, must be referring to that kind of insect which germinates in wine; if so, his explanation is refuted by the Rabbinic sources quoted above which show that <i>yavchushim</i> germinate in water]! The principle of the matter is that these <i>yavchushim</i> are a species that does not swarm upon the earth at all [and therefore is not included in the negative commandment mentioned further on in Verse 41, but is forbidden separately under the terms of the verse here dealt with].

Verse 12



Verse 13

AND THESE YE SHALL HAVE IN DETESTATION AMONG THE FOWLS. Of all fowls [existent], only those mentioned expressly in this section and their species — such as those concerning which it says, <i>after his kind</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> or <i>after her kind</i><sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> — are prohibited, since Scripture did not mention any signs of unclean birds [by which we may know that they are] forbidden, or of clean birds [by which we may know that they are] permitted. Instead, it said, <i>And these ye shall have in detestation among the fowls</i> — [so that only those specifically mentioned are prohibited], and no others apart from these. Similarly, in connection with the swarming things which convey impurity, which Scripture mentioned in detail,<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 29-30.</i> only those mentioned by name in the section are included in that law. Our Rabbis, however, have specified certain signs [of impurity as food] in birds, so that one may recognize through them that the fowls which lack those signs are not amongst those which are prohibited [here].<br>Now the most important sign [of unfitness as food] in fowls is preying, for every bird of prey<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi (Chullin 59 a) this means that the bird seizes its food from the ground in its claws, and eats it. Rabbeinu Tam explains it as meaning that it eats animals before they are dead. Ramban in his commentary (<i>ibid.</i>) interprets it as a bird of prey that kills by attacking with its claws. Further on in the text here Ramban will also elaborate on this characteristic.</i> is invariably unfit [as food]. The Torah removed it [from us] as food, because its blood becomes heated up due to its cruelty, and is dark and thick, which gives rise to that bitter [fluid in the body] which is mostly black<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 264.</i> and tends to make the heart cruel. There is not another fowl in the whole world that is a bird of prey apart from those mentioned in this section,<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 13-19.</i> and therefore one may know that any fowl which is a bird of prey, is one of those mentioned here. Thus if it is known for sure that it does not prey, it may definitely be eaten, for amongst all the forbidden fowls, there is only one which does not prey, namely the bearded vulture or the osprey, and the Sages were not concerned about it [being eaten because of reliance on the fact that it does not prey], since it is not found in habitated places, but dwells always in wilderness. Perhaps it is because it dwells in wastelands and its blood is affected for the worse by the burning heat, like that of the birds of prey, that the Torah prohibited it as food together with them.<br>The Sages furthermore counted<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 59 a.</i> amongst the signs [of fitness as food] that if a fowl be found which has an “extra” toe, and its crop and gizzard can be peeled, it is definitely fit [to be eaten], for the Sages knew that such a bird does not prey. But if it has only two of the three signs mentioned, we may not eat it; for the raven [which is a bird unfit as food, as stated in Verse 15], has an extra toe and a gizzard that can be peeled, and [therefore any bird that has only two signs of fitness] we suspect of being a raven or of its species, since they all have two tokens. It does not need to be said that if it has only one of the three signs mentioned we treat it as forbidden, for all the other forbidden fowls have one sign, except for the great vulture which has none of these three signs. Now the meaning of the term “preying” is that in hunting for food it chases after birds, catches them alive, presses on them with its claws and eats them, just as is done by the great hawk called <i>astur</i>, and the little hawk called <i>ashproir</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">This term is mentioned by Rashi on the word <i>haneitz</i> (the hawk): <i>Espervier</i> in old French; in English, sparrow-hawk (see Rosenbaum-Silberman’s translation).</i> and in Arabic, <i>butz</i>. The above is the correct law of birds, as to which are forbidden food and which are permitted, and that which is the final result of the [discussions in the] Gemara, and is in accordance with that which we have searched and found to be so through the examination of birds.<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary to Tractate Chullin 62 b, Ramban relates that in order to ascertain the meaning of the Talmudic texts on the difficult subject of the signs of birds, he conducted a lengthy investigation into the characteristics of all kinds of birds, realizing that “we cannot deny things visible to the eyes.” This is the background of his concise statement here: “It is something we have searched etc.” Discussions he held with hunters were also a part of that investigation.</i><br>Thus the reason for certain birds being forbidden as food is on account of their cruel nature. It is also possible that the reason for certain animals [being forbidden] is similar, since no animal that chews the cud and has a parted hoof is a beast of prey, while the rest all devour others. There has also been found a difference in nature [between animals fit for food and those which are unfit], as the Sages have mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah 38 b.</i> namely that all milks of animals fit for food, curdle, whereas all milks of those unfit for food, do not coagulate and cannot ever be made into cheese. Thus they are [physically] different. It is possible to say on the basis of this [difference in their natures, that those animals unfit for food] harm the procreative organs, so that the seed which gathers from their moisture is cold and extra-moist and will not beget at all, or not in the best and proper way, apart from the fact that there is a certain known benefit according to medical sciences [in eating those] animals that are permitted [by the Torah] as food. Now I have seen in some books of experiments<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">“Experiments.” Rabbeinu Bachya in quoting this passage of Ramban writes “Medicine” (in my edition, Vol. II, p. 461).</i> that if an infant drinks of the milk of a swine, that child will become a leper. This is a sign that there are very bad features to all unclean animals.

SHERETZ HA’OPH’ (WINGED SWARMING THINGS). “These are the thin, lowly creatures which crawl upon the ground, such as flies and hornets, mosquitoes and grasshoppers.” This is Rashi’s language. But I do not consider it to be correct, for a bird is not called <i>sheretz</i> (a swarming thing) on account of its smallness, nor is the unqualified term <i>oph</i> (bird) used because of the largeness of its body. The bat has very small legs, and many kinds of grasshoppers have larger ones than it, so why is the bat not called <i>sheretz ha’oph</i> (a winged swarming thing) like the grasshoppers?<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis, Vol. I, pp. 47-48, where Ramban discusses the same theme. Here the subject is more fully developed.</i> Rather, the meaning of <i>sheretz ha’oph</i> is written [in Scripture immediately] after it: <i>that go upon all fours</i>. For all fowls that walk upon two legs, have erect necks, and their heads face upwards, and they always depend on their wings and flap them; therefore they are called <i>oph kanaph</i> (winged fowl),<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:21.</i> or just <i>oph</i>. But those that have [four] legs walk lowly, with their neck and head bent downwards like creeping things, and therefore they are called <i>sheretz ha’oph</i> (a winged creeping thing), as I have explained in <i>Seder Bereshith</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> Similarly He referred back here and explained, <i>And all ‘sheretz ha’oph’</i> (<i>winged creeping things</i>) <i>which have four feet, are a detestable thing unto you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> the meaning thereof being as if He had said: “<i>all winged creeping things which have</i> only <i>four feet</i> and do not have jointed legs [above their feet] as mentioned [in Verse 21 amongst the signs of purity], <i>are a detestable thing unto you</i>.” The interpretation thereof in Torath Kohanim is:<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 3:10.</i> “Rabbi<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Note 117.</i> says: <i>And all ‘sheretz ha’oph’</i> (<i>winged creeping things</i>) <i>which have four feet, are a detestable thing</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> But if it has five feet, it is a clean species.”<br>Now in this section regarding winged creeping things there is only a positive commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things</i> etc. (Verse 21), from which you derive the principle that those that do not meet these criteria, are forbidden to be eaten by means of a negative commandment, and a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment carries the force of the positive commandment. Hence he who eats forbidden winged swarming (or creeping) things transgresses a positive commandment, for which there is no punishment by the court. But in the Book of Deuteronomy, Ramban continues, there is also an express negative commandment against eating it. Hence he who eats it incurs whipping.</i> but in the Book of Deuteronomy there is a prohibition mentioned in connection with it, [namely], <i>And all ‘sheretz ha’oph’</i> (<i>winged creeping things</i>) <i>are unclean unto you; they shall not be eaten</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14: 19. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 157-158; Vol. II, pp. 169-170.</i> It is on the basis of that verse there that whipping is incurred for violation thereof.

AND BY THESE YE SHALL BECOME UNCLEAN. “<i>By these</i> which are to be mentioned further on in the section, <i>ye shall become unclean</i>. Here<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 26. This part of the quotation from Rashi is also found in our Rashi texts on that verse, hence the use of the word “here.”</i> Scripture teaches you that the carcass of an animal <i>unfit</i> for food conveys impurity, and in the subject at the end of the section<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 39-40.</i> it explains [the law] concerning the carcass of an animal <i>fit</i> for food.” This is Rashi’s language. But if so, [the question arises], why did Scripture divide them and why did it treat them singly,<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">The twofold question is to be understood as follows: Why did Scripture divide and discuss them in two separate sections, and why was it necessary that the laws referring to the impurity conveyed by touching the carcasses of <i>unclean</i> animals, were discussed in Verses 24-28 in detail, with separate verses for each category of these unclean animals, when one general statement could have covered all subjects?</i> when it should rather have said [in one general statement], “whosoever touches the carcass of any animal shall be unclean until the evening, and whosoever carries any of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening?”<br>The correct interpretation is that here Scripture mentioned <i>the carcass of them</i> without qualification and did not mention “death” in connection with them, thus teaching that [the law of] ritual slaughtering [required to render animals fit for food] does not apply to them [the unclean animals mentioned here], and whoever touches them when they are no longer alive [whether they died by themselves or even if they were ritually slaughtered], becomes impure. But further on it states, <i>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 39.</i> thus teaching that if it [an animal fit for food] was ritually slaughtered, it does not convey impurity [to a person who touches it]. Now the meaning of the section in mentioning [here]: <i>And by these ye shall become unclean</i>, is to state that all things referred to above — namely, fishes, fowls, and grasshoppers — do not have this [law of] impurity, but only those which He is about to mention further on, these being <i>Every beast … which is not cloven-footed, nor cheweth the cud</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26.</i> It is with reference to these that He states, <i>they are unclean to you; every one that toucheth them shall be unclean</i><sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26.</i> with the uncleanness mentioned [in the preceding Verses 24-25: <i>whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even. And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even</i>]. Then He continues by stating that any beast which walks upon its paws shall also convey impurity until the evening to a person who touches its carcass, and that a person who <i>carries</i> it shall, in addition, wash his clothes.<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 27 and 28.</i> Similarly, <i>And these are they which are unclean unto you among the swarming things</i><sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 29.</i> means among those which are to be mentioned further on.<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">There in Verse 29 and in Verse 30: <i>the weasel, and the mouse</i> etc.</i> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra erred here.<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra explained the expression <i>and by those ye shall become unclean</i> (in Verse 24 before us) as referring to <i>sheretz ha’oph</i> (winged creeping things) and also to the fowls unfit for food as mentioned above in Scripture. But this is a mistake, since no impurity is conveyed by a fowl unfit for food, nor by a winged creeping thing unfit for food.</i><br>Now above, in stating the prohibition of eating [an animal prohibited as food], Scripture mentioned those animals which are not cloven-footed and do not chew the cud, but it did not mention [the law] of beasts that walk upon their paws. Perhaps it is because it is not customary to eat them [on account of the danger involved in catching them] that He did not single them out, but left them [to be] included in the general principle which He had stated, that we should eat only the animal that parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, and not others, and <i>chayah</i> (beast) is included in the term <i>beheimah</i> (animal) as it is said, <i>These are ‘ha’beheimah’</i> (<i>the animals</i>) <i>which ye may eat … the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14:4-5. Scripture begins here with <i>beheimah</i> and goes on to enumerate <i>chayah</i> (beasts).</i> Our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim have interpretations on this whole section. [Thus they explain the expression], <i>Every beast</i> [<i>which parteth the hoof, but is not cloven-footed …</i>] <i>is unclean to you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26.</i> to include a limb cut off from a living animal [in the law of conveying impurity].<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 6:6.</i> <i>And whatsoever goeth upon its paws</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 27 and 28.</i> to include a limb cut off from a dead animal [in the law of conveying impurity]. For Scripture speaks at length and mentions many expressions of impurity in order to allude [to the law] that they convey impurity in whole or in part, either through the death of the whole body or through the death of one of its limbs, as when it was cut off from a living body.
HE SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. The meaning of this expression in the whole section is that at night he becomes pure, if he had bathed his flesh in water [before sundown]. Scripture, however, speaks briefly [and therefore omitted] the bathing of the body, because it mentioned the washing of clothes of the one who <i>carries</i> anything unclean,<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 25.</i> which means their immersion [in a ritual pool], and it follows all the more so that he must bathe his body. Then when Scripture finished mentioning all the impurities [conveyed by] carcasses and [dead] creeping things, it mentioned immersion [for those vessels which became impure through touching them]: <i>it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 32.</i> the same law applying to man, for it is from here that the principle is derived. In another section He explained, <i>And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 17:15.</i> and He mentioned also the punishment for the violation thereof, <i>But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16. I.e., if he ate holy food or entered the Sanctuary in an impure state.</i> This is a general principle of all impurities [conveyed by] carrion, and from it the law is derived for [impurities conveyed by] creeping things. The matter of bathing [in the case of impurity conveyed by] creeping things has already been mentioned here, as I have written. Now Scripture was more severe in the case of a person who carries an impure object than in the case of a person who touches it, in requiring the bearer to wash his clothes, [but not one who only touches it], because it is natural that a person who touches does so with his hand lightly, while he who carries as a burden [does so in such a way] that it presses upon him, and in the majority of cases his clothes help him [in carrying].

AND EVERY THING UPON WHICH ANY PART OF THEM, WHEN THEY ARE DEAD, DOTH FALL, SHALL BE UNCLEAN: WHETHER IT SHALL BE ANY VESSEL OF WOOD etc. It appears to me in the interpretation of this verse that most likely the expression <i>any of them, when they are dead</i>, alludes to all those mentioned above — impure animals, creeping things, and beasts. For why should He mention the law of impurity of vessels and garments only with reference to creeping things, when it applies also to carcasses? Similarly, all the rules that He mentions with reference to making food susceptible to impurity<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 34, 37-38.</i> [conveyed by creeping things], apply equally to all [forms of] impurity, and Scripture speaks of the general concept of them. Do not find it difficult to accept that the expression <i>touch them when they are dead</i> in the first verse<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 31: <i>These are which are unclean to you among all that creep; whosoever doth ‘touch them, when they are dead,’ shall be unclean until the even</i>.</i> applies to the creeping things, while the same expression <i>any of them when they are dead</i> [in Verse 32 before us] applies to <i>all</i> things that convey impurity, for such is the case in many places in Scripture [where similar words apply to different things].<br>It is possible to say that Scripture waited until it had mentioned all impure things amongst cattle, beasts, and creeping things, and then at the end mentioned impurity of vessels with reference to one of them [namely, the creeping things], with which it had concluded this theme, in order that the law of all the others be derived from it, for the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Chagigah 11 a.</i> is that the expression <i>any of them when they are dead</i> [in Verse 32 before us] refers [only] to creeping things, and from that they learn that a creeping thing in [a minimal] size of a lentil conveys impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture (here in Verse 32) states <i>‘any of them’ when they are dead</i>, it shows that even though one has not touched the whole creeping thing but “any” part of it, he is rendered impure. “Now since the sand-lizard [one of the eight creeping things that convey impurity] when born is the size of a lentil,” therefore that amount of any of the eight creeping things when dead also conveys impurity (Chagiga <i>ibid.</i>). Thus according to the interpretation of the Rabbis, Verse 32 before us also speaks only of the impurity conveyed by creeping things, and not, as explained above, about all other impurities.</i> Scripture dealt likewise with the subject of immersion, in mentioning at the end of all [the laws of] impurity, the impurity [conveyed by creeping things] to vessels and their purification by immersion,<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 34-36.</i> and from it we learn the law of man and vessels with reference to all the impurities mentioned above.
IT MUST BE PUT INTO WATER, AND IT SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN; AND IT SHALL BE CLEAN. “Even after it has been immersed, it is still impure with regard to the heave-offering, until the setting of the sun, and afterwards at the setting of the sun it becomes pure.” This is Rashi’s language. And the interpretation in the Torath Kohanim is:<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 6:9.</i> “<i>And it shall be unclean until the even</i>. I might think that [it shall be impure] for all [purposes]; Scripture therefore says, <i>and it shall be clean</i>. But if so, I might think that it is pure for all purposes; Scripture therefore says, <i>and it shall be unclean until the even</i>. How then can this be explained? It is pure with respect to ordinary food<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">In Tractate Yebamoth 74a the reading [instead of “ordinary food”] is “the Tithe;” i.e., eaten by the owner in the city of Jerusalem in a state of purity. But the law regarding it is less stringent than that which applies to <i>terumah</i> (the heave-offering) eaten by the priest. Thus if an Israelite who was impure immersed himself to be purified, he may straightaway eat of the Second Tithe, even though the sun has not yet set. But a priest who was impure and immersed himself before sunset, may not eat of the heave-offering until the sun has set and the stars have come forth.</i> when it is still daytime [immediately after it was immersed to be purified], but regarding the heave-offering it is not held to be pure until it becomes dark.” The interpretation of the verse according to the explanation of the Torath Kohanim is thus: “it must be put into the water [before sundown] and it shall remain unclean till the evening.” But by way of the simple meaning of Scripture [the verse is to be transposed, thus]: “it must be put into water and it shall be clean, but it shall be unclean until the evening.”<br>Now Scripture mentioned in all the sections [that the impurity is] “until the evening,”<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 24-25, 27-28, 31-32.</i> because it refers to the degree of purity required for the holy heave-offering, as He said, <i>The soul that toucheth any such</i> [unclean things] <i>shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water. And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because it is his bread</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 22:6-7. “The holy things” here mean the <i>terumah</i> (the heave-offering).</i> But the purification required for ordinary food or the [Second] Tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Note 246.</i> is attained after immersion alone, and it is not mentioned here because it is not mandatory upon an impure person to purify himself in order to eat ordinary food,<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above in Ramban, Verse 8, at the end.</i> for if he wants to, he may eat it in a state of impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Scripture always speaks about the impure person being “unclean till the even,” because in order to be able to eat the heave-offering, the impure priest <i>must</i> purify himself, and wait till evening, whereas for ordinary food there is no requirement that it must be eaten in a state of purity, and thus no necessity to immerse oneself. If he does wish to eat it in a state of purity, however, he attains this immediately after immersion and even before sundown, as explained above in Ramban and in Note 246.</i>

Verse 33



Verse 34

OF ALL THE FOOD WHICH MAY BE EATEN, THAT ON WHICH WATER COMETH, SHALL BE UNCLEAN. Rashi commented: “This verse according to its [Rabbinical] interpretations teaches many things. We learn that food does not become fit to be susceptible of impurity until water has once come upon it, and once water has come upon it, it can subsequently at any time become impure, even after it has become dry, etc. Our Rabbis have further learned from this verse that ‘a secondary impurity’<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">Or as generally also referred to “a first degree of impurity.” Reference here is to a person or vessel that touched one of the eight dead creeping things enumerated in Verses 29-30, which are considered “fathers of impurity.” The person or vessel that touched them become “a first degree of impurity.” There are many “fathers of impurity.” Thus the carrier of those animals that are unfit for food, or of those which are fit for food but have not been slaughtered in the proper ritual manner, mentioned above in this section, also belong to this category [[illegible]] “a first degree of impurity.” Now “fathers of impurity” can convey impurity to people and vessels, whereas “a first degree of impurity” can only convey impurity to foodstuffs and liquids.</i> does not render vessels impure, for so we are taught etc. Again we learn that the coming of water upon vegetation makes it susceptible to impurity only after it has been plucked from the soil etc.” And included among the principles [we learn from this verse], Rashi said: “And we further learn that impure foodstuff does not convey impurity to other objects unless it [the former] consists of at least the size of an egg, for it says, <i>of all the food which may be eaten</i>, which means food which can be eaten in one gulp, and the Sages calculated that the esophagus does not hold more than a hen’s egg.” This is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi.].<br>But there is [too great a] brevity in Rashi’s comment. For this verse speaks about foodstuff itself becoming impure, and does not refer to its <i>conveying</i> impurity to others. The Rabbi [Rashi], however, derived this principle from what the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 9:1.</i> “<i>Of all the food</i> etc. <i>shall be unclean</i>. This teaches that food [upon which a dead creeping thing falls], is rendered impure even if it be of the smallest quantity. Now I might think that it can also <i>convey</i> impurity to other objects if the [original] impure food was of the smallest quantity; Scripture therefore says, <i>which may be eaten</i>. Thus you learn that it cannot render other things impure unless it is itself the size of an egg.”<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it was on the basis of this Torath Kohanim that Rashi interpreted the expression in the verse here, <i>of all food which may be eaten</i> as applying to “impure” food <i>conveying</i> impurity to others, the verse teaching us that the conveyor of the impurity must be of the size <i>which may be eaten</i>, which is, as explained above, the size of an egg. The verse could not refer to the original foodstuff itself becoming impure because of having touched a dead creeping thing [or any “father of impurity” — see above Note 251], for in that case even the smallest quantity of food suffices to be rendered impure. — But, Ramban continues, other scholars have already differed with Rashi on this point, bringing proof etc. (see text).</i> But other authorities have already differed<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">Tosafoth Shabbath 91 a.</i> with the Rabbi [Rashi], and they brought proofs that by Scriptural law foodstuffs do not [even] <i>become</i> impure at all unless they are of the size of an egg. Thus the interpretation of the Torath Kohanim [mentioned above] is merely a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic law,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">See in Exodus, <i>Seder Yithro</i>, p. 314, Note 449.</i> the Rabbis having added [the stricture] that foodstuffs of even the smallest size also <i>become</i> impure [although they cannot convey impurity to others unless they themselves are the size of an egg]. The main interpretation of the verse is as the Rabbis have said there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 9:1.</i> “<i>The food</i>. This is to exclude food for cattle [that it is not susceptible to impurity]. <i>Of all the food</i> — this is to include food for cattle which one intended to use for human consumption. <i>Which may be eaten</i>, excepting decomposed foods.”

Verse 35

AND EVERYTHING WHEREUPON ANY PART OF THEIR CARCASS FALLETH SHALL BE UNCLEAN; WHETHER OVEN, OR RANGE FOR POTS, ‘YUTATZ’ (IT SHALL BE BROKEN DOWN). Scripture teaches you here that the law of the oven and range for pots which are made of clay — in which fire is kindled and bread baked — is, [although they are] attached to the ground, like the law of earthenware pottery such as pots and jugs, which are burnt in a furnace and are movable objects, in that they too [oven and ranges], can become impure, and cannot [thereafter] be purified in an immersion-pool [in the same way that movable pottery cannot be purified].<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">Tosafoth Shabbath 91 a.</i> Scripture states <i>‘yutatz’</i> (it shall be broken down) and does not say <i>yishaber</i> [“it shall be broken in pieces” — as it says in speaking of movable earthenware which has become impure,]<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">Further. 15:12.</i> in order to teach that the oven and range need not be broken <i>so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a shard to take fire from the hearth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 30:14.</i> but instead they should be destroyed to the extent that they should no longer be capable of serving their [original] purpose. [The word <i>‘yutatz’</i> is] further used to teach that they become impure even though they are attached to the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">The novelty of this point is that generally whatever is attached to the ground is like the ground, and cannot become impure. The oven and range made of clay are thus an exception to this rule, for they are susceptible of impurity even though they are attached to the earth.</i> and [the owner] must break down what he built, for the meaning of the term <i>nethitzah</i> is the breaking down of something built, such as the expressions: <i>‘vatitzu’</i> (<i>and ye broke down</i>)<i>the houses;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 22:10.</i> <i>‘v’nathatz’</i> (<i>and he shall pull down</i>) <i>the house</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 14:45.</i>

Verse 36

NEVERTHELESS A FOUNTAIN OR A CISTERN WHEREIN IS A GATHERING OF WATER SHALL BE CLEAN. Scripture is stating that the waters in the immersion-pool whilst attached to the ground are not susceptible to impurity if any [source of] impurity should fall therein. BUT THAT WHICH TOUCHETH THEIR CARCASS SHALL BE UNCLEAN. The meaning thereof is as follows: “but waters which touch the carcass [of any of the creeping things] shall become impure, [meaning that waters which are <i>separated</i> [from a gathering of water] are rendered impure if they touch their carcass. [The phrase, <i>and</i> [<i>waters</i>] <i>which touch their carcass shall be unclean</i>, must be referring to detached waters], for when the waters are still attached to the pool, they cannot [be said to] ‘touch’ their carcass, but rather [Scripture should have said], their carcass ‘fell’ into it.” Scripture speaks of water in the singular [saying, <i>v’nogeia</i> — “and that which toucheth”], just as it says elsewhere, <i>the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 19:13. There too, Scripture uses the singular: <i>lo zorak</i> (was not sprinkled) in referring to water, although the Hebrew word <i>‘mayim’</i> is in the plural form.</i> Or it may be that Scripture is saying, “and whatsoever touches their carcass shall be impure,” and the intent is to include water and [the other] drinks mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 34 above.</i> In general, this verse comes to teach that water is susceptible to impurity when it is detached [from a pool], but not when it is attached thereto, a principle that has not been mentioned heretofore.<br>Now in the Torath Kohanim we find that [the Rabbis gave this interpretation]:<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 9:6.</i> “Rabbi Yosei the Galilean<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">The Sage generally known as “Rabbi Yosei” was Rabbi Yosei ben Chalafta, a disciple of Rabbi Akiba. To distinguish between him and another great teacher of the same name, the epithet “Galilean” was added to the name of the latter. It is this Rabbi Yosei whose opinion is here quoted.</i> said: <i>But that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean</i>. By touching they [i.e., the eight dead creeping things] convey impurity, but not by carrying them.” This too is feasible, that [the verse] is referring back to all the laws mentioned [in Verses 24-5] previously, and saying that creeping things convey impurity only by touch. Our Rabbis have further interpretations of the redundant expressions in this [whole] verse, all of them laws given to Moses on Sinai.<br>Now Scripture mentioned the purity of the immersion-pool and waters attached to the ground in speaking of [the impurity conveyed by] creeping things, but the same law applies to [that conveyed by] carrion [of animals forbidden as food, and of those permitted animals not slaughtered properly or which died by themselves]. It waited, however, to mention [the law concerning the purity of pools till now], until it had completed the enumeration of all objects that convey impurity. Or it may be that it is because creeping things frequently die in fountains or in cisterns. I have already mentioned my opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 32.</i> [that this verse mentions the impurity of vessels conveyed by creeping things and their purification by immersion, and from it we learn the law of people and vessels in connection with the other forms of impurity mentioned above].

Verse 37

ZERA ZEIRUA’ (SEED OF SOWING). “<i>Zera</i> means ‘seed’ of any kind of seed-plant. <i>Zeirua</i> is the noun (‘sowing,’ ‘thing sown’), like the expression, <i>and let them give us ‘zeiro’im’</i> (<i>edible seeds</i>) <i>to eat</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 1:12.</i> [<i>And if aught of their carcass fall upon any seed of sowing which is to be sown</i>] <i>it is clean</i>. This is to teach you that food is not fit and susceptible of becoming impure until water has once come upon it.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>Now Scripture mentioned above, <i>of all the food which may be eaten, that on which water cometh</i> [<i>shall be unclean</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 34.</i> establishing the principle that foodstuff must first become susceptible to impurity [through coming into contact with water]. But there the Rabbis interpreted it to mean<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in Rashi <i>ibid.</i>, on basis of Torath Kohanim.</i> the foodstuff is not rendered impure through the medium of the interior of an [impure] earthen vessel, unless it was made susceptible of receiving impurity by being moistened by water. But here Scripture added that even from [contact with] the creeping things themselves, foodstuff does not become impure unless it was made susceptible [by water]. So it is explained in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 11:8.</i><br>It is also possible to say that the expression <i>of all the food which may be eaten</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 34.</i> refers to the things mentioned above — meat and various foods. But here He states that even seeds when taken out to be sown, can be rendered impure if they have become susceptible to impurity by being moistened by water. The reason for foodstuffs having to be made susceptible by water [before they can become impure], is that the uncleanness of [dead] creeping things and the other sources of impurity, attaches to foodstuffs in their state of moisteness, but not when they are dry. The Torah then, as an extra precautionary measure, declared impure those foods on which water had once come, although they have [subsequently] become dry, [if they were then touched by any of the sources of impurity], in order that the rule should not vary according to different standards. Now the law of making food susceptible of becoming impure applies also to the impurity [conveyed] by carrion, Scripture having mentioned it here for the reason we have stated above.<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban at end of Verse 36 above.</i>

Verse 38



Verse 39



Verse 40

AND HE THAT EATETH OF THE CARCASS OF IT SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES, AND BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse speaks here of one who eats in the way that people usually eat, namely, that he touches and carries what he eats, and therefore becomes impure by contact and by carrying. It was necessary to mention this case so that it should not occur to anyone that because of eating, his degree of impurity should be greater [than that resulting merely from contact and carrying]. It mentioned this law in regard to an animal fit for food [as mentioned in the preceding Verse 39], because a person can [easily] err with regard to it, thinking that it was slaughtered properly [and he will therefore eat it], but such errors do not normally occur with regard to forbidden animals, and the way of the Torah is to speak of what usually happens. But according to its [Rabbinic] interpretation,<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">Niddah 42 b.</i> the verse comes to prescribe the [minimum] size required to become impure through carrying or touching, namely an amount that can be called “eating,” which is the size of an olive and Scripture also mentioned this law in regard to carrion of an animal fit for food, whilst the same law applies to an animal not permitted as food, because He finished here the law of impurities.<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">And therefore He mentioned it in regard to the carrion of an animal fit for food, and from it we apply the rule to the carrion of an animal unfit for food. This is in accordance with similar explanations mentioned above.</i> According to the opinion of the interpretation of the Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini</i> 4:2; 10:1-4.</i> all impurities [conveyed] by carrion [of animals fit for food and those which are unfit animals] are included here, and the section above<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verses 26-27.</i> refers to limbs of animals.

Verse 41

AND EVERY CREEPING THING THAT CREEPETH UPON THE EARTH IS A DETESTABLE THING; IT SHALL NOT BE EATEN. The meaning of this verse is as follows: He mentioned above the [eight] creeping things<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 29-30.</i> in connection with impurity [conveyed through contact when they are dead], and expressly mentioned those that are impure, but did not speak at all of the prohibition of eating. It is for this reason that He now says, <i>And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten</i>, meaning to say that as far as eating is concerned, there is no difference between them, for they are all forbidden. Then He spoke of them again in detail [in the following verses], and increased the negative commandments about them, [in order to increase the liability] to whipping, just as Rashi mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 44: “<i>Neither shall ye defile yourselves</i>. This is repeated to indicate that a person transgresses many negative commandments if he eats the detestable things” (Rashi).</i>

TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN AND THE CLEAN. This means that we should distinguish between all things mentioned above, between the unclean and the clean, with regard to impurity[through contact]. AND BETWEEN THE ANIMAL THAT MAY BE EATEN. This is connected with the word “soul” mentioned [in the preceding verse], thus meaning: “and between the living animal that may be eaten.” Scripture is thus stating that we should distinguish as far as eating is concerned, between the living animal that may be eaten according to the Torah <i>in the waters</i> and <i>upon the earth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 46.</i> and the animal in them that may not be eaten. In the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis said:<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, at end of <i>Shemini</i>.</i> “<i>And ‘hachayah’</i> (<i>the beast</i>) <i>that may not be eaten</i>.

Is it necessary to tell us to distinguish between the cow and the ass? Have they not clearly been defined already [by distinguishing signs]?

Verse 1



Verse 2

Rashi commented: “<i>If a woman have conceived seed, and born</i> [<i>a male</i>]. This includes a case where she gave birth to [the male child as] a fleshy mass which had dissolved, so that it became liquefied and like seed, in which case his mother becomes impure because of the birth” [as if it were a normal child]. The explanation of this matter<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban is clarifying Rashi’s words and saying that Rashi did not refer to a case where the abortion was a foetus filled with water, for in that event the mother does not become impure for the days prescribed for a male or for a female child. Rather, Rashi referred to a case where the child had been formed already etc.</i> is that we know that the child has been formed already in human form, and then became liquefied, for anything that does not have a human form is not considered a child, and similarly, whatever is not fit to become a creature with a soul, is not considered a child. But even if it is a fleshy dissolved mass at the time of birth, it makes the mother impure [for the prescribed number of days] provided we recognize its form, such as a foetus with its human parts fashioned, in which case the mother is certainly impure, and if not [i.e., the matter is in doubt] she is impure because of a doubt. This is what this verse comes to include according to the words of our Rabbis.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Niddah 27b.</i><br>Now with regard to the implication of the verse the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31a.</i> “<i>Ishah ki thazria</i> —<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “if the woman has [an emission of] seed” first. — Then, as the verse continues, she will bear a male-child.</i> if the woman emits seed first, she will bear a son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“And when the male is the first to emit semen, then she will bear a female-child.”</i> The intent of the Rabbis was not that the child is formed from the woman’s seed, for although the woman has generative organs [i.e., ovaries] like those of the man, yet seed is not formed by them at all, or [if it is formed], that seed is not thick and does not contribute anything to the embryo. Rather, the Rabbis used the term “she emits seed” with reference to the blood of the womb, which gathers in the mother at the time of the consummation of coition, and attaches itself to the seed of the male. For in the opinion of the Rabbis the child is formed from the blood of the female and the white [semen] of the man, and both of them are called “seed.” Thus the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31a.</i> “There are three partners in [the formation of] man: The male emits the white [semen], from which are formed the sinews, the bones, and the white substance in the eye. The female emits a red secretion from which are formed the skin, the flesh, the blood, the hair, and the black substance in the eye.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">“And the Holy One, blessed be He [i.e., the third partner in the formation of the child] gives him spirit and soul, beauty of features, power of sight, power of hearing, speech and walk, and understanding and rational faculty” (Niddah 31 a).</i> The opinion of doctors as to the formation [of the embryo of the child] is also the same. In the opinion of the Greek philosophers,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. I, p. 76 (in Verse 18) where Ramban alludes to this controversy.</i> however, the whole body of the child is formed from [the substance of] the blood of the mother, the father only contributing that generative force which is known in their language as <i>hyly</i>, which gives form to matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>, p. 23.</i> For there is no difference at all between the egg of a chicken which is laid because it was fructified by a male, and that laid as a result of the mother rolling herself in the dust, except that the egg [that had been fructified by a male] germinates into a young bird, while the other is <i>not sown, nor beareth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 29:22. The thought here suggested is: “because the seed of the male was lacking, therefore it does not bear.”</i> because it is deprived of the elemental heat which is its <i>hyly</i>. And if so, the word <i>tazria</i> [in <i>ishah ki thazria</i>] will be like <i>u’cheganah zeiru’eha thatzmiach</i> (<i>as the garden causeth the seeds that are sown in it to spring forth</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 61:11. — Ramban’s meaning is as follows: According to the view of the Rabbis [and the doctors] that the child is formed both by the seed of man and the secretion of woman, the expression <i>ishah ki thazria</i> can be understood in its simple meaning: “when the female emits her secretion” first etc. But according to the philosophers who say that the child is formed entirely from the body of the mother, and the male semen is merely a generative force which gives form to matter, then the word <i>tazria</i> can no longer mean “emitting,” but is like <i>thatzmiach</i> — “causes to spring up.”</i> And so did Onkelos render it: “If a woman conceives.”
D’VOTHAH.’ “This is an expression for anything which flows from her body, derived from the wording<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In our text of Rashi: “Another interpretation.”</i> for malady [<i>madveh</i>] and sickness, for no woman sees an issue of blood without becoming unwell, and her head and her limbs feeling heavy on her.” This is Rashi’s language. But I do not know on the basis of which root the word <i>d’vothah</i> can be an expression in the Sacred Language for “anything which flows.” But it is possible that it is an expression of malady, on the basis of what the Rabbis have said,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Niddah 9 a.</i> “and her head and limbs are heavy on her.” So also is the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, who writes: “<i>D’vothah</i> is a noun and means sickness, for the blood which issues indicates a sickness in the woman.” Now it is true that the flow constitutes a cleansing of surpluses [of blood], and due to the fact that her head and her limbs feel heavy upon her, the flow is perhaps termed “a sickness.” The correct interpretation, however, is that <i>d’vothah</i> is an expression derived from the word <i>madveh</i> [which does not mean “sickness,” i.e., an unnatural occurrence in the body, since a woman’s menses are natural; and <i>d’vothah</i> is therefore like the terms] plague and pain, just as in the expressions: <i>My heart is ‘davoi’</i> (<i>faint</i>) <i>within me;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 8:18.</i> <i>for this our heart is ‘daveh’</i> (<i>faint</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 5:17.</i> and like: <i>the plague of his heart</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 8:38.</i> Thus menstruation is an affliction upon the woman even though it is in her nature [to experience it regularly].

Verse 4

AND SHE SHALL THEN ‘TEISHEIV’<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “sit” or “dwell.”</i> (REMAIN) IN THE BLOOD OF PURIFICATION THREE AND THIRTY DAYS. “The term <i>yeshivah</i> [literally: <i>sitting</i>] signifies here ‘remaining,’ just like in the verses: <i>‘vateishvu’</i> (<i>and ye stayed</i>) <i>in Kadesh;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 1:46.</i> <i>‘vayeishev’</i> (<i>and he dwelled</i>) <i>by the terebinths of Mamre</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 13:18.</i> This is Rashi’s language. But if so, the verse is stating: “for another thirty-three days she should still wait, touching no hallowed thing nor coming into the Sanctuary, even though they are days of purity as far as [physical relationship with] her husband,”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">A woman after the birth of a male child is impure for seven days like a menstruant, and is forbidden to have conjugal relations with her husband. For the next thirty-three days, even though she has an issue of blood, she is permitted to her husband, but she may not eat of the offerings nor come into the Sanctuary until the forty-first day, when she brings her prescribed offerings (Verses 6-8). For a female child the number of impure days are fourteen, and the waiting period until she may eat of the offerings etc. is sixty-six days, and she brings her offerings on the eighty-first day. — It should be pointed out that this is the <i>Scriptural</i> law which explains the verses and the text of Ramban before us. For the practical law to be observed today, see further, Note 23.</i> this being the sense of the expression <i>in the blood of purification</i>. Scripture uses this expression [<i>‘remain’ in the blood of purification</i>, instead of saying “and she shall then be … “] in order to inform us that even though she sees no issue of blood during these [thirty-three days for a male child, or sixty-six for a female], she must still wait this entire period on account of the childbirth [before she may eat of the hallowed food or enter the Sanctuary]. It is possible that the expression <i>teisheiv</i> here is like in the verse, <i>Many days ‘teishvi’</i> (<i>thou shalt sit solitary</i>) <i>for me; thou shalt not play the harlot, and then thou shalt not be any man’s wife</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 3:3.</i> for a woman who has intercourse with her husband is called <i>yosheveth lo</i> (sitting for him).

Rabbi Moshe Isserless states the law as it is to be observed today. After commenting that in some places it is customary that during the entire forty-days period for a male-child and eighty for a female, the mother does not purify herself for her husband by immersion in a ritual pool, he states the law to be as follows: “But in those places where there is no such custom, we should not be stringent at all. Rather, immediately after she has not seen blood following the seven-days for a male-child and fourteen for a female, and after she counted a further seven <i>clean</i> days, she is permitted to her husband. But if she again saw even a drop of blood as tiny as a grain of mustard, she is unclean. For although by Scriptural law it is clean blood, yet the custom has already been accepted in all Israel that no coition is permitted if there is clean blood, the law applicable thereto being in every respect like that of other [unclean] blood” (Yoreh Deah 194:1, Rama).</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that a woman in the days of her menstruation is called <i>niddah</i> (shunned) because she was avoided by and kept distant from all people. Men and women would not approach her, and she would sit alone and not speak with them, for even her speech was considered by them impure, and they regarded the dust upon which she stepped to be impure as the dust of the decomposed bones of the dead. Our Rabbis have mentioned this.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Vol. I, p. 387.</i> Even her gaze was considered harmful, and I have already mentioned this in <i>Seder Vayeitzei Ya’akov</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 387-388, and Note 224 there.</i> Thus it was the custom of menstruants to sit in a special tent, this being the intent of Rachel’s words to her father [Laban], <i>Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 31:35.</i> since it was their custom that a woman in that condition should not walk, nor let the sole of her foot step upon the ground. That is why the Torah was more stringent in regard to what the menstruant sits upon or lies upon [in that both the person who touches them and his garments are rendered impure]<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 15:21-23.</i> than with respect to touching [the menstruant herself, in which case the person himself is rendered impure, but not his garments].<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> Similarly Scripture said in regard to the leper: <i>he shall dwell</i> [literally: “sit”] <i>alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 13:46.</i> and it did not say as it did in the case of the other impure persons, <i>and he shall go out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 23:11.</i> Rather, it mentioned the term “sitting,” meaning that he is to avoid walking, since his odor and breath are harmful. It is for this reason that Scripture says here that for another thirty-three days <i>she shall ‘sit’ in the blood of purification</i>, in the same place where she sat in the [seven] days of impurity on account of the childbirth, and further prohibited by means of a negative commandment from touching hallowed things or coming into the Sanctuary during that time. The [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, <i>Tazria</i> 1:7.</i> “<i>She shall continue</i> [in the blood of purification for three and thirty days]. This comes to include a woman in hard labor during the eleven days,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It is important to clarify first certain basic <i>Scriptural</i> concepts in order to understand the text before us: (a) Commencing with the day on which a woman first sees a menstrual issue, she is to count seven days of impurity. During these days she remains impure, and forbidden to her husband, whether or not she sees another issue in the course of them. The issue, however, having ceased before the sun has set on the seventh day, she is to immerse herself that night in a ritual pool and may enter into conjugal relations. [However, for the Rabbinic ordinance as observed today, see Note 35.] (b) After these seven days of impurity effecting the menstruant, commences “the eleven-day period” (here referred to in the text) during which she becomes subject to the law affecting the <i>zavah</i> (a woman suffering a flux outside her regular period). That is to say, if during this period she sees one or two issues on the same day or on two consecutive days, she only has to immerse herself in a ritual pool on the following day, and returns to her purity with the setting of the sun. A woman suffering a flux of this kind is often referred to as “a minor <i>zavah</i>.” If, however, during the eleven-day period she sees one or more issues on three consecutive days, she becomes “a major <i>zavah</i>,” being under the obligation to count seven “clean days” after the complete cessation of the flux. And if in the course of these seven “clean days,” she sees another issue, she is to commence counting seven “clean days” anew. With the completion of the counting of seven completely “clean days,” the major <i>zavah</i> is to immerse herself in a ritual pool, bringing on the following day the prescribed offering (further, 15:29-30). Thus it is clear that by ordinance of the Torah, the law of the menstruant is far different from that of the <i>zavah</i>, to which she is subject during “the eleven-day” period, or the intervening time between her regular periods. See additionally, Note 35 as to the Rabbinic ordinance.</i> that she be pure from <i>zivah</i> (the law of ‘flux’).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Thus a woman who was in protracted labor for <i>three</i> days of this “eleven-day period” [during which ordinarily the laws of <i>zivah</i> would have applied], and she saw issues on these three consecutive days, is yet <i>not</i> subject to this law. But, as the text continues, if she was in hard labor during her seven days of menstruation and she saw an issue, she is impure as a menstruant.</i> I might think that she should also be regarded as pure from [the impurity conveyed through] menstruation;<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Note 32 (a).</i> Scripture therefore says [<i>as in the days of the impurity of her sickness</i>] <i>shall she be unclean</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">It is important to note that by Rabbinic ordinance a woman seeing an issue <i>at any time whatever</i>, is under obligation to count seven completely “clean days” after the cessation of the issue last seen — irrespective of whether she has seen the last issue within the seven-day period, or at any time thereafter. She must then immerse herself in a ritual pool, whereupon she is considered purified, and may enter into conjugal relations — the conditions attaching to the eating of hallowed food no longer of course being in force in our days because of the destruction of the Sanctuary and the absence of certain other means of ritual purification.</i>
IN THE BLOOD OF ‘TAHORAH’ (PURIFICATION). According to Rashi this means that even though she sees [an issue of blood during this period of thirty-three days for a male child, and sixty-six for a female], she is nevertheless pure by law of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This as noted above is the Scriptural law. Rabbi Moshe Isserless states the law as it is to be observed today. After commenting that in some places it is customary that during the entire forty-days period for a male-child and eighty for a female, the mother does not purify herself for her husband by immersion in a ritual pool, he states the law to be as follows: “But in those places where there is no such custom, we should not be stringent at all. Rather, immediately after she has not seen blood following the seven-days for a male-child and fourteen for a female, and after she counted a further seven <i>clean</i> days, she is permitted to her husband. But if she again saw even a drop of blood as tiny as a grain of mustard, she is unclean. For although by Scriptural law it is clean blood, yet the custom has already been accepted in all Israel that no coition is permitted if there is clean blood, the law applicable thereto being in every respect like that of other [unclean] blood” (Yoreh Deah 194:1, Rama).</i> And so did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra write, that the meaning of the above expression is that “it constitutes pure blood in contrast to the blood of the menstruant, and therefore does not convey impurity, G-d having decreed in the case of a male child [a forty-days period for the after-effects of the childbirth upon the mother — seven impure days and thirty-three pure days], corresponding to the number of days necessary for the form of the male child to be completed in the womb, while that of the female child is double [fourteen impure days and sixty-six pure days, corresponding to the eighty days it takes for the female child to be formed in the mother’s womb]. This is clear and tested.”<br>But in my opinion the meaning of the word <i>tahorah</i> is cleanness [in a physical sense], similar in meaning to <i>‘zahav tahor’</i> (<i>pure gold</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 25:39.</i> which means smelted and refined. A similar expression is found in the verse, <i>And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 3:3.</i> Thus the meaning of the expression here is as follows. Having commanded that a woman who gives birth to a male child be impure for seven days <i>as in the days of her impurity</i>, because then she usually sees issues of blood from the interior of the womb [from which the menses are discharged], He further commanded that she should wait for another thirty-three days, staying in her house in order to cleanse her body; for during all these days she will emit the remnants of blood and the turbid, ill-smelling secretions which come from these bloods, and then she will become cleansed <i>from the childbirth, pregnancy and conception</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Hosea 9:11.</i> and she may come to the House of G-d. Now our Rabbis have received the tradition that during these [thirty-three days for a male child and sixty-six for a female], she is pure for her husband, because with reference to the seven impure days it says that they are <i>as in the days of the impurity of her sickness</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 2.</i> but in connection with these [thirty-three days etc.] He said that she is impure as regards [eating or touching] hallowed things and entering the Sanctuary, but not for non-holy things nor for her husband, just as the Rabbis have said,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 31 a.</i> “Her husband is not a holy object.”<br>The reason that the time is doubled in the case of the birth of a female child [i.e., fourteen impure days and sixty-six pure days], is perhaps as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said [as mentioned above] in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, that the formation of a male child is completed on the forty-first day, and that of a female child on the eighty-first day. But according to the opinion of the Sages who say that both male and female are completed on the forty-first day, we must say that the reason [why the time is doubled in the case of a female child] is that the nature of the female is cold and moist, and the white [fluid] in the mother’s womb is then exceedingly abundant and cold, this being the reason why she gave birth to a female child. Hence she needs a longer time to become clean [in a physical sense], on account of the abundant moisture in her which contains the ill-smelling blood, and on account of the coldness [of her body], as is well-known that sick people who suffer from cold need a longer period to restore their vigor than those who are hot.

The main purport of this statement of the Rabbis is that since she only swears on account of her pain, and the oath is moreover not capable of fulfillment, because she is subject to her husband, therefore the Torah wished for her to atone for that which came into her mind [and therefore commanded her to bring these offerings].

AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON. Because it is according to the word of the priest <i>that every strife and every plague shall be</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 21:5. The following is the law of plagues or leprosy, which is the subject of the coming sections: “All are qualified to inspect the leprosy-signs, but only a priest may pronounce them impure or pure” (Negaim 3:1). If the priest was unskilled in these laws, a learned person would tell him to say “pure” or “impure” (<i>ibid.</i>). — It should also be pointed out that while <i>tzara’ath</i> is generally translated as “leprosy” and as such represents a <i>physical</i> disarray in the body of the person, in Jewish tradition it also carries with it <i>a moral and spiritual</i> meaning as illumined further on by Ramban in Verse 47.</i> therefore this communication came also to Aaron. Or it may mean that G-d spoke to Moses that he should tell it to Aaron, as our Rabbis have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Mechilta, at beginning.</i> It does not state here, “speak unto the children of Israel,”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">As it says in the case of the offerings (above, 1:2, and elsewhere).</i> because it is the priests [who have the duty] when they see the impure [with leprosy] to force them to be quarantined and be cleansed. Now in the section dealing with cleansing of the leper it says, <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying: This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 14:1-2.</i> [and there it mentions neither “speak to the children of Israel,” nor to the priests], because there is no need to urge the Israelite to become cleansed [when his plague of leprosy is healed], nor to urge the priest to perform the rites of the offerings, as they do so willingly. In the section dealing with a person suffering from an issue it does say, <i>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 15:2.</i> because since the matter is of an intimate nature, unknown to others, He admonished them that they should each inform the priest of their sickness.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In view of the fact that decisions of purity and impurity in cases where a man or woman saw a flux was <i>not</i> dependent upon the pronouncement of the priest, unlike the law in cases of leprosy (see Note 46 above), Ramban’s words must be understood in the following sense: Since the priest has occasion to perform the Service in the Sanctuary, and even when he is outside it, he may eat <i>terumah</i> (the heave-offering), which he is forbidden to eat when impure, therefore the Israelite who is suffering from a flux and thus rendered impure must let the priest know of his condition, so that he should not be defiled on account of him. See my Hebrew commentary, Vol. II, p. 534 (beginning with the fifth edition).</i>

Verse 2

SE’EITH O SAPACHATH O BAHERETH’ (A RISING, OR A SCAB, OR A BRIGHT SPOT). “These are the names of the plagues, each one whiter than the other.” This is Rashi’s language. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that “<i>se’eith</i> is a term for ‘burning,’ the word being associated with the expressions: <i>‘v’hamaseith’</i> (<i>and the beacon</i>) <i>began to arise up;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 20:40.</i> <i>‘va’yisa’eim’</i> (<i>and</i>) <i>David</i> (<i>burned them</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 5:21.</i> It is possible that it is called <i>se’eith</i> [literally: ‘uprising,’ ‘swelling’], because it is in the nature of fire to rise upwards. <i>Sapachath</i> is of the root: <i>‘sphacheini’</i> (<i>attach me</i>), <i>I pray;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 2:36.</i> <i>‘v’nispechu’</i> (<i>and they shall cleave</i>) <i>to the house of Jacob</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 14:1.</i> — signifying a sickness which attaches to one place. <i>Bahereth</i> is of the root, <i>‘bahir’</i> (<i>bright</i>) <i>in the skies</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Job 37:21.</i> becoming a sort of sign or mark.” [Thus far is Ibn Ezra’s interpretation.] If so, the term <i>se’eith</i> is the name of the plague caused by the bitter green burning fluid [in the body],<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 264.</i> and <i>bahereth</i> is caused by the white fluid, and <i>sapachath</i> is brought about by a combination of both of these fluids. Now our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 6 b.</i> “The word <i>se’eith</i> is always an expression of ‘rising,’ and so it is stated in Scripture, <i>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills ‘hanisa’oth’</i> (<i>that are lifted up</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 2:14.</i> and <i>sapachath</i> always means ‘attachment,’<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This means as follows: The two principal colors of leprosy-sign are <i>bahereth</i> and <i>se’eith</i>. To each of these two colors Scripture has added a <i>sapachath</i> — a second shade of it. Thus the number of colors is four. See further, Notes 105 and 107, for the precise nature of these colors and their gradations.</i> and so it is stated in Scripture, <i>‘sphacheini’</i> (<i>attach me</i>), <i>I pray</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 2:36.</i>

Verse 3

AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE PLAGUE BE DEEPER THAN THE SKIN OF THE FLESH. “Every white color appears deep [in contrast to the darker color surrounding it], just as a color illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow.” This is Rashi’s language. For this reason when the Rabbi [Rashi] reached the following verse, stating, <i>And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4. At this point it is necessary to explain some of the basic principles on which the following discussions of Ramban in this whole section of <i>Tazria</i> are based: (a) Any of the four colors of white (see Note 105) which appears <i>in the skin of the flesh</i>, does not of itself render the person impure, unless in addition it has one of the three symptoms of impurity, which are: if the plague has turned a minimum of two black hairs in the white patch in the flesh to white, or some “quick flesh” has appeared in the middle of the plague, or, if not having had one of these symptoms to begin with, the person was shut up for seven days, and then it was seen that the white patch of the plague had spread in the skin. (b) If any of these four colors appear in a place where there was an inflammation or a burning inflammation, the person is rendered impure only by means of one of these two symptoms: hair changing color from black to white, or the spreading of the white patch of the plague in the skin. The appearance of “quick flesh” in this case is <i>not</i> a sign of impurity. (c) If a plague appears in the hair, the symptoms of impurity are one of two: if the plague has caused a minimum of two hairs to turn gold-colored, or if it has spread in the skin. (d) A special lengthy discussion appears in Ramban (further in Verse 29) as to the precise nature of the plague which the Torah calls <i>nethek</i> (Verse 30), and which laws regulate it. Other laws pertinent to these discussions are clearly set forth in the text. Finally, it should be noted that a person shut up or quarantined for a week by the priest is rendered unclean in every respect as a leper that is certified unclean, except that he need not go with unkempt hair and rent garments; also, if declared “clean” by the priest at the end of the week he need not do the cutting off of the hair and the bringing of the bird-offerings etc., as they are required of the leper that had been certified unclean when healed of his leprosy (see further Chapter 14) (Megillah 8 b).</i> he wrote, “I do not know the meaning of this.” The sense of Rashi’s statement is as follows: It appeared to him difficult, for since the bright spot is white, it is impossible that the appearance thereof should <i>not</i> be deeper than the skin, even as the color of anything illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow!<br>Now we are in a position to remove this difficulty. For the verses do not speak of the appearance of a plague seeming deeper than the skin, unless two hairs in the plague become white [such being the case in Verse 3 before us]. But when it states [as it does in the following verse], <i>and the hair thereof be not turned white</i>, it says, <i>and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4. At this point it is necessary to explain some of the basic principles on which the following discussions of Ramban in this whole section of <i>Tazria</i> are based: (a) Any of the four colors of white (see Note 105) which appears <i>in the skin of the flesh</i>, does not of itself render the person impure, unless in addition it has one of the three symptoms of impurity, which are: if the plague has turned a minimum of two black hairs in the white patch in the flesh to white, or some “quick flesh” has appeared in the middle of the plague, or, if not having had one of these symptoms to begin with, the person was shut up for seven days, and then it was seen that the white patch of the plague had spread in the skin. (b) If any of these four colors appear in a place where there was an inflammation or a burning inflammation, the person is rendered impure only by means of one of these two symptoms: hair changing color from black to white, or the spreading of the white patch of the plague in the skin. The appearance of “quick flesh” in this case is <i>not</i> a sign of impurity. (c) If a plague appears in the hair, the symptoms of impurity are one of two: if the plague has caused a minimum of two hairs to turn gold-colored, or if it has spread in the skin. (d) A special lengthy discussion appears in Ramban (further in Verse 29) as to the precise nature of the plague which the Torah calls <i>nethek</i> (Verse 30), and which laws regulate it. Other laws pertinent to these discussions are clearly set forth in the text. Finally, it should be noted that a person shut up or quarantined for a week by the priest is rendered unclean in every respect as a leper that is certified unclean, except that he need not go with unkempt hair and rent garments; also, if declared “clean” by the priest at the end of the week he need not do the cutting off of the hair and the bringing of the bird-offerings etc., as they are required of the leper that had been certified unclean when healed of his leprosy (see further Chapter 14) (Megillah 8 b).</i> For such is the distinctive characteristic of anything illuminated by the sun: if there is something black scattered about in it, there will not be an appearance of depth to a person who looks at it. Now hair in its natural state is dark, and therefore destroys the appearance of depth of the plague. When the hairs in the plague have turned white or yellow,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 30.</i> then only does the whiteness of the plague shine brightly, and appears to anyone who looks at it from a distance as if it were deeper [than the skin of the flesh].<br>Yet despite all this, that which the Rabbi [Rashi] has said — “Every white color is deeper [in contrast to dark colors surrounding it]” — does not appear to me to be correct. For the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 6 b.</i> “The word <i>se’eith</i> is always an expression of ‘rising,’” and the <i>se’eith</i> is white, as it is written, <i>‘se’eith l’vanah’</i> (<i>a white rising</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> and the Rabbis have further said:<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 5 b.</i> “<i>Se’eith</i> is [as white] as white wool, and its second [subsidiary] shade is as white as the membrane of an egg.” Thus <i>se’eith</i> is very white, and [according to Rashi] it should appear very deep, so why then do the Rabbis call it “rising?” Scripture also does not state anywhere concerning the color of <i>se’eith</i> that it is deeper than the skin!<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Further in Verses 19-20 Scripture states: <i>And in the place of the boil there is ‘se’eith l’vanah’</i> (<i>a white rising</i>) <i>or ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>a bright spot</i>) <i>… and the priest shall look; and behold, if the appearance thereof be ‘shaphal’</i> (<i>lower</i>) <i>than the skin</i>. Now the word <i>shaphal</i> (lower) refers obviously to both <i>se’eith</i> and <i>bahereth</i> mentioned before. But according to Rashi, Ramban asks, why does it not state concerning the color of <i>se’eith</i> that it is <i>‘amok min ha’or’</i> (“deeper” than the skin) instead of “lower” than the skin, when, as Rashi put it, “Every white color is ‘deeper’ [in contrast to the black surrounding it]?” And here too (in Verse 3 before us) it merely says that <i>the appearance of ‘the plague’ be deeper</i>, but it does not say so about the <i>se’eith</i>!</i> And in the Torah Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim <i>Tazria</i>, Negaim 1:4.</i> “What is the meaning of the term <i>se’eith?</i> It is ‘rising,’ just as the color of the shadow is <i>higher</i> than that of anything illuminated by the sun.” And if every white color is deep [in contrast to a dark color surrounding it, as Rashi put it], then the fact is the opposite [of what the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim]! Perhaps we may say that the terms <i>se’eith</i> signifies “rising” in contrast to <i>bahereth</i>, so that if you place both of them together, the <i>bahereth</i> will appear as if illuminated by the sun, and the <i>se’eith</i> at its side will have the appearance of the shadow, while both of them in relation to the skin [which is darker] will appear as deeper.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Thus we have explained the saying of the Rabbis that <i>se’eith</i> signifies “rising,” for it is only in contrast to <i>bahereth</i> which is bright-white like snow, that the duller color of <i>se’eith</i> appears “higher.” Thus there is no contradiction between this statement of the Rabbis and that which Rashi said, that “Every white color is deep etc.,” since the above interpretation of the Rabbis concerning <i>se’eith</i> was with reference to a contrast of a still brighter color. It still remains to explain why Scripture does not speak of <i>se’eith</i> as appearing “deeper” than the skin, but instead speaks of it as being “lower” than the skin (see Note 65 above). This point Ramban will now proceed to explain.</i> Yet Scripture [nonetheless] does not speak of the color of <i>se’eith</i> as being deeper than the skin!<br>The explanation of this matter appears to me to be as follows. There is a kind of white which shines into and dazzles the eyes just as the appearance of the sun does, with the result that the eyes are incapable of receiving the intense color of that whiteness, and therefore it seems to him [a person looking] as if it were deep, just as the color illuminated by the sun appears deeper than the shadow, because the eye can receive the darker color and it is fixed thereon, whereas the white color scatters the visionary power and appears further removed from it, and therefore seems to be deep. Thus the whiteness of <i>bahereth</i> which is a bright white like snow,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Negaim 1:1.</i> causes the visionary power to be weakened, just as it becomes weak in a place illuminated by the sun, provided that there is no black hair in the <i>bahereth</i>, in which case the visionary power concentrates on the black and from there it spreads out to the whole appearance of the plague and does not “flee” from it [on account of its intense whiteness, and therefore it does not appear to be deeper than the skin].<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">This explains Verse 4 which states: <i>And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</i> — on which Rashi had commented, “I do not know the meaning of this,” for the reason explained above. Ramban explains it on the basis of physical laws of nature, that since the verse continues to state, <i>and the hair thereof be not turned white</i>, therefore the visionary power of the eye concentrates on the black hair, and from there it spreads forth to the white plague, and consequently the whiteness does not appear deeper than the skin.</i> Now the plague known as <i>se’eith</i> is also white, but its whiteness is not intense [as that of <i>bahereth</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The color of <i>se’eith</i>, as mentioned above, is as white as white wool.</i> and it does not weaken the visionary power; therefore the eye spreads out [over the whole plague] and sees it closely with the result that the <i>se’eith</i> appears near to it and elevated, just as when one looks at the stars which appear to be high in the heavens.<br>Now in the case of an inflammation [in the skin, in which symptoms of leprosy occurred], Scripture mentions two colors, <i>a white ‘se’eith’</i> (<i>rising</i>) <i>or a white ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>bright spot</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 19.</i> intermingled with red, and states concerning it, <i>behold, it be in sight ‘lower’ than the skin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20. At this point Ramban interprets the phrase quoted as referring back to both <i>se’eith</i> and <i>bahereth</i>. Further on he will explain it as referring only to <i>bahereth</i>. See further, Note 73.</i> but does not say “deeper” [than the skin], because although that <i>bahereth</i> is an intense white, the redness in it lessens the “depth” thereof and makes it appear only slightly “lower” [than the skin].<br>But by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the phrase <i>behold, it be in sight ‘lower’ than the skin</i> only refers back to the <i>bahereth</i>, but of <i>the white se’eith’</i> (<i>rising</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 19.</i> it does not say so.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">For since Ramban has explained above that it is <i>not</i> in the nature of every form of white to appear deeper than the skin [unlike Rashi who stated categorically, “Every white color is deep etc.,” as a result of which Rashi found it difficult to explain the phrase in Verse 4: <i>and the appearance thereof be ‘not’ deeper than the skin</i>, as mentioned above] and since <i>se’eith</i> is only as white as white wool, unlike the <i>bahereth</i> which is bright-white like snow, therefore Scripture does not speak of it as appearing “lower” than the skin. Instead, the phrase, <i>behold, it be in sight ‘lower’ than the skin</i> (Verse 20) refers back only to the white <i>bahereth</i>. It is only according to Rashi who wrote that “Every white color appears deeper etc.” that the phrase in Verse 20, <i>behold, it be in sight ‘lower’</i> etc. refers back to both <i>se’eith</i> and <i>bahereth</i> mentioned in Verse 19.</i> And concerning both of them [<i>se’eith</i> and <i>bahereth</i>] Scripture says [in the case of an inflammation in the skin], <i>But behold, if there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> for on account of the redness [which is intermingled in the white], and the blackness of the hair, the plague has lost even its appearance of being “lower” [than the skin] and is only “dim.”<br>In the case of a burning by fire Scripture mentions, <i>and the quick flesh of the burnt part have a white ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>bright spot</i>), <i>reddish-white or white</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> and then it continues [in the following verse] to state, <i>and it be in sight ‘deeper’ than the skin;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 25.</i> [that refers back only] to “the white” [in the preceding verse, but not to the reddish-white, which, as explained above, does not appear to be “deeper” than the skin]. Then it states further on, <i>But if the priest look on it, and behold, there be no white hair in the ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>bright spot</i>), <i>and it be no lower than the skin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26.</i> In this case He mentioned the matter of being “lower” or not with reference [also] to “the reddish-white” [in Verse 24], thus teaching that the appearance of the plague either as “deep” or “low” is an indication of impurity, and that they are only pure if there is no appearance at all [of the bright spot] being “lower” than the skin, but instead it is only “dim.”<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And if the ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>bright spot</i>) <i>stay in its place … but it be dim … the priest shall pronounce him clean</i> (Verse 28).</i><br>Now the Torah desired the purity of Israel and the cleanliness of their bodies, and it therefore took measures to keep this sickness [of leprosy] far from them at its very inception, for these colors [of the plagues] are not yet the real leprosy, but they lead to it. Doctors state in their books: “We should fear <i>beharoth</i> [bright spots in the skin of the flesh] more than the leprosy itself.” That is the reason why Scripture calls them when they are just beginning, <i>the affliction of leprosy</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 2, 3, 9, etc.</i> meaning an affliction of a leprous nature, but not yet the actual leprosy. It is when the symptoms of impurity are clearly identified, after the leper has been put in quarantine [for a trial period], that Scripture says, <i>it is leprosy</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> meaning that it is possible that it is a genuine form of leprosy. At times Scripture will say of impurity, <i>and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affliction of leprosy</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 25.</i> the meaning thereof being to state that the priest shall declare him impure at once, for it is an affliction of a leprous nature that will surely result in actual leprosy, and therefore it is advisable that he be separated from the people from that moment on. Similarly, <i>and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affliction</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> means that it is a great affliction which will not be healed [easily], but instead will grow the whole day and spread [into the skin] as it has done till now.<br>As to that which Rashi stated [in Verse 3 before us] that: “It is a Scriptural ordinance [the reason of which is not known] that hair that has become white is a symptom of impurity” — <i>this is the interpretation of the thing;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 5:26.</i> <i>it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:21.</i> that person, for a plague which does not turn the hair white, is only an ugly spot in the skin, but not a secretion which will cause any sickness.

Verse 4



Verse 5

AND THE PRIEST SHALL LOOK AT HIM ON THE SEVENTH DAY, AND BEHOLD, IF THE PLAGUE STAY ‘B’EINAV.’ “This means in its original color and size.”<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <i>b’einav</i> is “in his eyes,” i.e., the eyes of the priest examining the plague. Ramban will further on stress this literal meaning of the word.</i> This is Rashi’s language. Similarly, <i>‘v’eino’</i> (<i>and the appearance thereof</i>) <i>was as the appearance of bdellium;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 11:7.</i> and so also, <i>‘k’ein’</i> (<i>like the color of</i>) <i>the crystal ice</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 1:22. These two verses bear out Rashi’s interpretation of <i>einav</i> as meaning “its appearance,” thus making the sense of the verse to be: and, behold, <i>if the plague stay ‘in its appearance.’</i></i><br>But in the Torath Kohanim we have been taught as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 37. Thus if after having shut the person up in a house for seven days, the priest is in doubt whether the plague has spread [in which case he would pronounce it at once as a genuine case of leprosy], but his son or pupil who saw it at the beginning says definitely that the affliction did not spread, the priest may follow their opinion and may shut him up for another seven days. See my Hebrew commentary p. 70, for further discussion of this point.</i> “[From the expression here] I know only that the plague so appeared [i.e., in its original size] in his own [i.e., the priest’s] eyes. Whence do I know that the same law applies if it so appeared in the eyes of his pupil? Scripture therefore says [in Verse 27]. <i>But if the scall stay ‘b’einav.’</i>” Now if so, the meaning of the verse here would be: “and if the plague is at a stay in the sight of the aforementioned priest,” namely that it has remained as it was, neither having changed its place nor having spread in the skin, wheresoever the priest looks [then he shall shut him up for another seven days]. The usage [of the term <i>a’yin</i> (eye)] is often found in the words of the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>chachamim</i> (Sages) is evidently used by Ramban here not in the strict sense of the term, as referring to the Sages of the Talmud, as I have not found this expression in Talmudic literature. It must then be a reference to the later scholars in whose writings this expression abounds.</i> Thus: “So it appears in my eyes.” So also you find [in Scripture]: <i>O man of G-d, I pray thee, let my life be precious ‘b’einecha’</i> (<i>in thy sight</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 1:14.</i> meaning, in your opinion and thought. Thus the verse here alludes to the principle that the priest in examining whether the plague has extended in the skin need only judge it as he sees it, but it is not necessary that [he base his decision] upon measuring the plague.

Verse 6

AND THE PRIEST SHALL SEE HIM A SECOND TIME THE SEVENTH DAY, AND BEHOLD, IF THE PLAGUE BE ‘KEIHAH’ (DIM), AND THE PLAGUE BE NOT SPREAD IN THE SKIN, THE PRIEST SHALL PRONOUNCE HIM CLEAN. Rashi commented: “<i>Keihah</i> means it has become paler<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Since the term <i>nega</i> (plague) is masculine, and <i>keihah</i> (pale) is in the feminine, the word <i>keihah</i> cannot be an adjective to <i>nega</i> [meaning: “if the plague is pale”]. Instead, it must mean, as Rashi points out, “if the plague <i>has become</i> pale,” serving as a verb.</i> than its [former] color. [This allows the inference] that if the plague remains in its former color and has not extended in the skin, he is impure.”<br>This indeed is the sense of the verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">For since the verse states two conditions for the priest’s pronouncement that the person is pure — namely, if the plague has become paler, and the plague be not spread in the skin — it is obvious that if only the first condition has been met, but not the second, that the person is impure. This is the meaning of Ramban’s comment on Rashi’s statement.</i> But the interpretation of our Rabbis is not so, for we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Negaim 1:3.</i> “To cause to be put in quarantine [for a second week] such a plague which continues unchanged at the end of the first week; to pronounce pure such a plague which continues unchanged by the end of the second week.” And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have expressly said<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 2:8.</i> that in the case of garments, if the plague is at a stay at the end of the first week, they are to be put in quarantine [for a second week], and if it be at a stay at the end of the second week, they are to be burnt; but in the case of a person, if the plague be at a stay at the end of the first week the priest is to put him in quarantine for another week, but if at the end of the second week it is still at a stay he is to pronounce him pure. And in Tractate Megillah the Rabbis have further said:<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Megillah 8 b.</i> “This excludes a leper who has been put in quarantine for a week, whose state of leprosy is determined not by his bodily condition, but merely by days.”<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">“For if on the seventh day the symptoms of impurity are not found in the plague, namely, the black hair in it has not turned white, or that the plague did not spread in the skin, the priest will pronounce him pure, even though the plague is still at a stay” (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> Now if it were necessary that the plague should become dim, then his purity <i>would</i> be dependent upon his bodily condition! Rashi himself explained it there in such language, saying that the leper’s purity is not dependent on the physical state of the plague, for if at the end of seven days a symptom of impurity — white hair or extension of the plague — is not found, the priest is to pronounce him pure although the plague has stayed in its appearance, that is at the end of the second week.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">If the plague has stayed in its appearance at the end of the first week that the infected person was shut up, Verse 5 clearly states, <i>then the priest shall shut him up seven days more</i>. The discussion here relates only to the end of the second week.</i><br>Rather, this is what the Sages said:<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 2:6.</i> at the end of the second week, whether the plague has paled from the color of snow to [the shade of white of] the lime used in the Sanctuary, or like the white of an egg’s membrane, or even if it has become stronger, namely, that it was at first like the lime [used in the Sanctuary] and then [at the end of the second week] it had become bright-white like snow, and all the more so if it remained in its original color — as long as it did not spread in the skin, the priest pronounces it pure. If so, the interpretation of this verse is as follows: “<i>if the plague be ‘keihah,’</i> meaning that it has turned into the color of another plague, such as from that of snow to that of lime, since <i>it has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is but a scab</i>.” For in order that one should not say, “since the plague has changed into the color of another plague it must be inspected from anew,” Scripture therefore expressly taught that he is deemed pure. The same law applies if the color became stronger, since Scripture has already taught you that a change from color to color is not a symptom of impurity, but rather is considered as if it is at a stay, and as long as it did not spread in the skin [the afflicted person] is pure. Should you ask: “But why did Scripture not mention expressly the case of a change to a stronger color [as being pure], and we would know that this is all the more so if it became paler?” [The answer is that Scripture] came to teach you that although it became paler, if it spread in the skin he is nevertheless impure. Now the meaning of the word <i>keihah</i> is that the plague has become paler, changing to one of the colors of leprosy-signs, such as from that of snow to that of an egg’s membrane, which can still be a leprosy-sign. But if it has become paler than the colors of leprosy-signs, in that case the person is already healed, and there is no longer a plague; thus even a spreading thereof no longer renders him impure at all. In a similar manner to this presentation has it been explained in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 2:6.</i>

AND THE PRIEST SHALL SEE, AND, BEHOLD, IF THERE BE A WHITE RISING IN THE SKIN, AND IT HAVE TURNED THE HAIR WHITE, AND THERE BE QUICK RAW FLESH IN THE RISING.

If so, the meaning of the verse is: “<i>and it have turned the hair white</i>, or <i>there be quick raw flesh in the rising</i>.” It mentions here white hair in the case of <i>se’eith</i> (rising) although it stated it already in the case of <i>bahereth</i> (bright spot),<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> in order to teach us that in the case of both colors white hair is a symptom of impurity. Our Rabbis have explained<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 3:7.</i> that the reason [why white hair is mentioned here when it has already been said above that it is a symptom of impurity] is in order to establish the minimum size of the quick flesh [mentioned here], that it must be large enough to contain the white hair, [the smallest number implied] being two.

AND IF THE LEPROSY BREAK OUT ABROAD IN THE SKIN, AND THE LEPROSY COVER ALL THE SKIN OF THE PLAGUE<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from Ramban’s words further on, that he interpreted the Hebrew <i>eth kol or hanega</i> literally: “all the skin of the plague.” It is generally translated though: “all the skin of him that hath the plague.” As explained further, Ramban also understands the verse to apply only where the leprosy covered the whole body, while the expression <i>all the skin of the plague</i> serves to teach us some new matter, as stated in the text.</i> FROM HIS HEAD EVEN TO HIS FOOT … [HE IS CLEAN]. Now the breaking out of the leprosy is not deemed a symptom of purity, until it spreads over the entire body, except for the places which the Sages enumerated in the Mishnah,<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Negaim 8:5.</i> which do not prevent a person who has turned completely white [from being pronounced pure]. If so, what is the meaning of the phrase <i>all the skin of the plague</i> [which would indicate that only the area of the plague need be turned white]? Rather, the meaning thereof is as follows: “<i>and the leprosy cover all the skin of the plague</i> and <i>from his head even to his foot</i>.” Scripture is thus stating that the place of the plague and the whole body have turned white, but if the whole body has become white, and the appearance of [the area of] the plague has turned to <i>bohak</i><sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 39. “Lentil-like spots, and between the spots the flesh shows bright with a pure brightness” (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>). Now the verse there concludes that <i>bohak</i> is pure. But Ramban here points out that if the leprosy broke out and covered all the person’s body, except that the original place of the plague turned into <i>bohak</i>, he is impure, since before the rule of the present verse applies, the leprosy must spread also to cover the skin of the plague. The same rule applies even if the skin of the plague became completely healed, as mentioned next in the text.</i> or it became healed, the person is impure.

IF A MAN OR WOMAN HATH AN AFFLICTION UPON THE HEAD OR THE BEARD. “Scripture intends to differentiate between a plague which is on a place where hair grows, and a plague on the flesh, for as regarding a plague on the flesh the symptom of impurity is white hair, while the symptom of a plague on a place where the hair grows is gold-colored hair — that the black hair has turned into gold-colored. 30. ‘NETHEK HU’ (IT IS A SCALL). This is the name of the plague on a place where hair grows.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>It would appear from this language that the difference between a plague upon the head or beard and a plague in the skin of the flesh, is that which Rashi mentioned, namely, the white hair and the gold-colored; thus if a plague occurs in any of its four colors<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The four colors of the plagues are: <i>bahereth</i> (bright-white like snow), <i>se’eith</i> (white as white wool); <i>sid ha’heichal</i> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <i>krum beitza</i> (the membrane of an egg). Of these four shades the whitest is <i>bahereth</i>, the next is <i>se’eith</i>, the next <i>sid</i>, and the dullest is <i>krum beitza</i> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i> 1:2). See further Note 107.</i> in a place where hair grows upon the head or beard, and if the hair became gold-colored, then the person is impure, just as he is impure if the hair turned white in a plague on the skin of the flesh. But how is it possible to say so! Rashi himself has written [further on]: “<i>As the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 43.</i> [It is like the color of the leprosy which is mentioned in the section dealing with plagues of the skin of the flesh, namely] that it makes one impure by means of any of the four white colors,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The four colors of the plagues are: <i>bahereth</i> (bright-white like snow), <i>se’eith</i> (white as white wool); <i>sid ha’heichal</i> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <i>krum beitza</i> (the membrane of an egg). Of these four shades the whitest is <i>bahereth</i>, the next is <i>se’eith</i>, the next <i>sid</i>, and the dullest is <i>krum beitza</i> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i> 1:2). See further Note 107.</i> and it is not to be treated like the color of the <i>nethakim</i> (scalls) on the place where hair grows, which do not render a person impure by reason of the four colors: the <i>se’eith</i> and its secondary shade, and <i>bahereth</i> and its secondary shade!”<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sid ha’heichal</i> is the secondary shade of <i>bahereth</i>, and <i>krum beitza</i> is the subsidiary species of <i>se’eith</i>. A priest who does not distinguish between these four shades of white, and does not know them by name and how they are related to each other, has no authority to inspect the plague (Rambam, above, Note 105). He may, however, bring with him a learned person — even if he be an Israelite — who upon examining it will direct him to say “pure” or “impure” etc. (Rambam, <i>ibid.</i>, 9:2).</i> Now if [a <i>nethek</i>] does not render the person impure by means of one of these four colors,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The four colors of the plagues are: <i>bahereth</i> (bright-white like snow), <i>se’eith</i> (white as white wool); <i>sid ha’heichal</i> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <i>krum beitza</i> (the membrane of an egg). Of these four shades the whitest is <i>bahereth</i>, the next is <i>se’eith</i>, the next <i>sid</i>, and the dullest is <i>krum beitza</i> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i> 1:2). See further Note 107.</i> then by what color and under what condition <i>does</i> it render one impure? Scripture has mentioned only the signs necessary for declaring him <i>absolutely</i> impure, namely, if gold-colored hair appeared in the <i>nethek</i> or spreading thereof took place<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 30, 36.</i> [but, according to Rashi, Scripture has left unspecified what color the <i>nethek</i> must be originally, in order that it be subject to inspection]! Indeed, it seems that the Rabbi [Rashi] thought Scripture informed us of the name of the plague upon the head or beard by stating <i>‘nethek hu’</i> (<i>it is a scall</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 30.</i> meaning that this is its particular name, the designation by which it is recognized. Thus Scripture mentioned in the case of the plagues [in the skin of the flesh] their names and their colors, namely, <i>‘bahereth l’vanah’</i> (<i>a bright spot which is white</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 4.</i> <i>‘se’eith l’vanah’</i> (<i>a white rising</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> and in the case of the head it also mentioned its name [namely, <i>nethek</i>], for by that designation it is known, and that name indeed Scripture declared to be impure, and then it went back and explained the symptoms [of the <i>nethek</i>] for the person to be declared absolutely impure at the end [i.e., after he had been put in quarantine for a week]. This is the Rabbi’s [Rashi’s] opinion on the <i>nethek</i> (scall).<br>This interpretation of Rashi’s opinion is further borne out by his words when he said that the sense of the following section, <i>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head</i><sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 40.</i> is to say that if a man’s hair falls off his head and he becomes bald, <i>he is clean</i>; that is, “he is clean from the impurity of <i>nethakim</i> (scalls in a hair-spot) on the head,” and he is no longer rendered impure by the kind of plague called <i>nethek</i>, but instead he is subject to the laws of a plague on the skin of the flesh, [namely] <i>se’eith</i> and its secondary shade, for since there is no hair there [after becoming bald] he is excluded from the law applying to the head or the beard.<br>But all this is not so. For as long as the head or beard contain hair, they do not render the person impure at all by means of any of the colors of leprosy [since they are not “the skin of the body”]. But when baldness affects a certain part of the head, the hair falling out from its very roots, and that place becomes smooth and clear of any hair, and then there grows in that baldness <i>a gold-colored thin hair</i><sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 30.</i> — that is the impure plague [dealt with here]. It is for that reason that it is called <i>nethek</i> [of the root <i>nothak</i> — “to tear away”] because the hair has become removed from there, and it is not merely a name, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote. Rather, <i>for as his name is, so is he</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 25:25.</i> for [in order that the law of <i>nethek</i> should apply], it is necessary that the hair falls out [on the head or the beard] in a place [at least] the size of a bean, and after the natural falling out of this first hair from that place, if that gold-colored “afflicted” hair springs up, it is a symptom of impurity. This does not apply if the gold-colored hair come there before the baldness. So also we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Negaim 7:1.</i> “If [<i>a bahereth</i>] appeared on the head or the beard,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Now the head or the beard become impure only by a <i>nethek</i> (scall), and not by a <i>bahereth;</i> (a bright white spot). Thus when the <i>bahereth</i> first appeared on the head or the beard, the person remained pure. Later on when he became bald, in which case the law of <i>bahereth</i> might have applied, he also remains pure, because the <i>bahereth</i> preceded the baldness.</i> and then the head or the beard became bald, they are pure. If it were on the head or the beard before these grew hair, and they then grew hair and again became bald, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov declares them impure, since both in the beginning and at the end they were impure. But the Sages declare them to be pure.” And with regards to gold-colored hair which precede [the <i>nethek</i>] we have also been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 10:4.</i> “If gold-colored hair preceded the <i>nethek</i> (scall) it is pure. Rabbi Yehudah declares it impure. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: It neither renders the person impure, nor does it afford him protection.”<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">The law of hair which has become gold-colored because of the <i>nethek</i> provides that if there be two black hairs in it, the person is pure [although all the other hair have turned gold-colored]. But if there be in it two gold-colored hairs that were there before the <i>nethek</i> came, and turned the other black hair gold-colored, they do not afford protection to the <i>nethek</i>, and the person is impure. Thus Rabbi Eliezer’s statement: “It neither renders the person impure [if all the hair turned gold-colored before the <i>nethek</i> appeared], nor does it afford protection” [thus we do not say that since it was naturally gold-colored before the <i>nethek</i> appeared, and not as a result of it, it is considered like black hair which renders the person pure, because although it is not in itself a symptom of the plague, it is nonetheless unable to protect the person from impurity unless its natural colors is black].</i> This whole topic is similarly taught also in the Sifra.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Tazria</i> 8:6.</i><br>The reason why Scripture does not mention “the baldness” at first [but instead begins Verse 29 before us by stating: <i>If a man or woman hath an affliction upon the head or the beard</i>], is because it mentioned with reference to the plague on the head or beard a “deep appearance” and “gold-colored hair,”<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 30.</i> and it is impossible that the appearance thereof should be deep in the same way that the color of the sun appears deeper than the shadow, as long as a person’s black natural hair is still upon him. Therefore Scripture spoke about the customary way of people, for when plagues come upon their head, [that part of the head] first becomes bald, and then a plague arises in the baldness, in which the thin short gold-colored hair grows. Then [in Verse 30] Scripture explains <i>‘nethek hu’</i> (<i>it is a scall</i>), in order to make it quite clear that he is not to be declared impure unless there was a baldness.<br>Now in the opinion of most commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">So clearly set forth by Rabad in Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i>, 8:1, and in 16:1.</i> this plague, namely, the <i>nethek</i>, need not have a <i>bahereth</i> (a bright spot) or <i>se’eith</i> (rising) nor their subsidiary species,<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sid ha’heichal</i> is the secondary shade of <i>bahereth</i>, and <i>krum beitza</i> is the subsidiary species of <i>se’eith</i>. A priest who does not distinguish between these four shades of white, and does not know them by name and how they are related to each other, has no authority to inspect the plague (Rambam, above, Note 105). He may, however, bring with him a learned person — even if he be an Israelite — who upon examining it will direct him to say “pure” or “impure” etc. (Rambam, <i>ibid.</i>, 9:2).</i> nor any change of appearance in the skin of the head, but as soon as the hair fell out from a spot the size of a bean on the head or beard, and is entirely uprooted from its roots, that is the plague, and if thin gold-colored hair appears in it, the person is impure. This is <i>the leprosy of the head or of the beard</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 30.</i> For Scripture first declared the person impure <i>if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it gold-colored thin hair</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 30.</i> and then it mentioned that if <i>the appearance thereof is not deeper than the skin</i>, that the plague must be shut up for a week;<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> then it declared him to be impure if [after this week] the <i>nethek</i> spread in the skin,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 36.</i> the sense thereof being that [in the case of the spreading of the <i>nethek</i>] the appearance thereof need not be deeper than the skin, nor different in any way [for him to be declared impure]. Now surely these two symptoms [of impurity in the <i>nethek</i>], namely, spreading of the plague and appearance of gold-colored hair, are alike in their laws. If so, the verses intend to teach us that whether the appearance of the <i>nethek</i> is as deep as the appearance of a <i>bahereth</i>, or whether it is not as deep or is not different in any way [from the rest of the skin], as soon as the baldness occurs, the person is rendered impure if gold-colored hair appears in it or if the <i>nethek</i> spreads in the skin. There are many Beraithoth<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i>, Note 65.

On Sifra, see <i>ibid.</i>, Note 121.</i> taught on this subject.<br>Yet [despite all this] it would appear that after the hair falls off from a spot on the head, it is not to be deemed a plague until a <i>bahereth</i> or its subsidiary species appears in that bald spot, or a <i>se’eith</i> or its subsidiary species,<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sid ha’heichal</i> is the secondary shade of <i>bahereth</i>, and <i>krum beitza</i> is the subsidiary species of <i>se’eith</i>.

Of these four shades the whitest is <i>bahereth</i>, the next is <i>se’eith</i>, the next <i>sid</i>, and the dullest is <i>krum beitza</i> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i> 1:2).

The effect of this is sometimes a more lenient ruling, and sometimes a more stringent one. The more lenient ruling is that they do not render the person impure by means of white hair, and the more stringent one is that he is to be pronounced impure by reason of the gold-colored hair. And the interpretation of the verse, <i>And if the priest see the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up</i> [<i>him that hath</i>] <i>the plague of the scall seven days</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> is similar to that mentioned above [in the section dealing with the plagues of the skin of the flesh]: <i>And if ‘bahereth’</i> (<i>the bright spot</i>) <i>be white in the skin of the flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 4.</i> for the expression <i>‘nega hanethek’</i> (<i>the plague of the scall</i>) [here in Verse 31] alludes to the principle that the [four] colors of the “plagues” apply to the <i>nethek</i> as well.<br>This matter requires further study of the Tosephta<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “Addition.” The Tosephta is a collection of Beraithoth, compiled by Rabbi Chiya, soon after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi. The books of the Tosephta follow closely those of the Mishnah. Hence the expression here, “the Tosephta to Tractate Negaim.”</i> to Tractate Negaim. For we have been taught there as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta Negaim 1:2.</i> “<i>Nethakim</i> (scalls) cause impurity in all colors, even white on black or black on white, and they cause impurity by means of thin yellow hair which appears to be gold-colored.” Thus far [is the language of the Tosephta]. It would appear from this text that there has to be in the bald part some [distinguishing] color of a plague, either white on the skin of a black-haired man, like the [four] colors of plagues, or even a black plague on the skin of a white-haired man, like “the black <i>murphia</i>” which doctors mention, since Scripture always speaks of <i>‘nega hanethek’</i> (<i>the plague of the scall</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> indicating that there has to be a plague in the <i>nethek</i>, but it did not specify any colors for them as it did in the case of [the plagues of] the skin of the flesh. And the second section, <i>And the man whose hair is fallen off his head</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 40.</i> teaches that the law of <i>nethakim</i> applies only if the hair falls off the middle of the head, and hair remains surrounding the <i>nethek</i> on all sides. But if the hair falls off from the back of the head, or towards the face, and that whole side becomes bald [and a plague appeared therein], its status is not to be determined by the symptoms of impurity of the head or beard [namely, gold-colored hair or the spreading of the <i>nethek</i>], but rather by the symptoms of plagues of the skin of the flesh [namely, the appearance of white hair or the spreading of the plague or quick flesh]. The reason for this [distinction between the various locations of the baldness of the head] is that it is in the nature of many people that some of their hair at the sides of the head, in the back or in front becomes bald, and the falling off of the hair there is no sign of sickness, but instead is like the rest of the body. But when the hair falls off from the middle of the head, the place where there normally is hair, it can only be a plague which caused it, that plague in our language being termed <i>tinim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">In one Ramban manuscript: <i>tirna</i>.</i> and in Arabic it is called <i>al sa’afah</i>. Accordingly Scripture excluded from this law hair which falls out from the front of his head and the back, since it is usual for people to become bald at those places. And the verse which states, <i>But if there be ‘bakarachath’</i> (<i>in the bald towards the back of the head</i>), <i>or ‘bagabachath’</i> (<i>the bald forehead</i>), <i>a reddish-white plague</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 42.</i> means that these parts of the head convey impurity as does the rest of the body — by the [four] colors of plagues whether there is a reddish mixture in the white or it be a plain white. Scripture further states <i>as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 43.</i> This means that [if there is baldness towards the back of the head or the forehead] he is also certified absolutely as impure by quick flesh or the spreading of the plague, which is “the appearance of leprosy” that is certified absolutely as impure in plagues of the skin of the flesh. Now our Rabbis have mentioned that it is not certified as impure by means of white hair, just as we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Negaim 4:3.</i> “Quick flesh causes impurity <i>bakarachath</i> (in baldness towards the back of the head), or <i>bagabachath</i> (baldness in the forehead), whereas it is not so with the white hair.” It is also so expressed in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 11:2.</i><br>But some of the commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Found in the commentary of Rabbeinu Shimshon of Sens to Negaim 10:10. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 74.</i> stated that the sense of the Scriptural sections is to differentiate between a person afflicted with a <i>nethek</i> [which is discussed in Verses 29-37] and with baldness [as mentioned in Verses 40-44]; and the meaning of the matter is that <i>karachath</i> and <i>gabachath</i> both denote plucking out of the hair in such a manner that it will never grow again, such as where he applied a certain ointment to the hair of his head which caused it to fall out, or where it fell out at its roots naturally, when the moisture [feeding it] dried up. Thus the meaning of this section according to this opinion is that at first Scripture spoke [in Verses 29-37] of <i>nethek</i>, which is a falling off or cutting of the hair, similar to the expressions: <i>‘v’nathuk v’charuth’</i> (<i>or torn off, or cut</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 22:24.</i> <i>as soon as the soles of the priests’ feet ‘nithku’</i> (<i>were drawn up</i>) <i>unto the dry ground</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 4:18.</i> Then Scripture states [in Verses 40-44] that if the head be <i>yimareit</i>, meaning that the hair was plucked out by force, thus leaving the bald and shiny <i>like burnished brass</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 7:45.</i> similar to that which is written, <i>it is furbished that it may glitter</i><sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 21:15.</i> which as is known will never grow hair again — that is not a <i>nethek</i>, but rather this man <i>‘keireiach hu’</i> (<i>he is bald in the back of his head</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 40.</i> or <i>gibeiach hu’</i> (<i>he is bald near his forehead</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 41.</i> as other people who are bald, and <i>he is clean</i><sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 40-41.</i>. But if there be in this baldness towards the back or front of the head one of the [four] colors of plagues<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">The four colors of the plagues are: <i>bahereth</i> (bright-white like snow), <i>se’eith</i> (white as white wool); <i>sid ha’heichal</i> (the white lime used in the Sanctuary), and <i>krum beitza</i> (the membrane of an egg). Of these four shades the whitest is <i>bahereth</i>, the next is <i>se’eith</i>, the next <i>sid</i>, and the dullest is <i>krum beitza</i> (Rambam Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Tum’ath Tzara’ath</i> 1:2). See further Note 107.</i>, he will be subject to the same law of impurity as is the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh, and through their symptoms, namely, quick flesh and the spreading of the plague in the skin [after having been shut up for a week]; except that the Sages in their interpretation excluded from [these symptoms of impurity] white hair [which in the skin of the flesh <i>is</i> a sign of impurity but not in baldness towards the back or front of the head]. The reason for this is that the hair of the head has been plucked out in such a way that it will never grow again, and even if a few hair appear by chance, they will never be black [so that they could through turning white on account of the plague, serve as a sign of impurity], nor will they have the characteristics of hair, but they will be merely some weak form thereof and white. This is the opinion of the French scholars in the commentary to Tractate Negaim.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Found in the commentary of Rabbeinu Shimshon of Sens to Negaim 10:10. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 74.</i> The sense of the Mishnayoth and Beraithoth taught there [in that tractate] tend to support their words. If so, <i>nethek</i> [mentioned in Verses 29-37] is the sickness [called in Arabic] <i>sa’afah</i> [as stated above], or the well-known sicknesses called “the sickness of the fox,” and “the path of the snake,” all these being forms of sickness which can be remedied [so that the hair grows again]; but “the plucking out” of the hair [mentioned in Verses 40-44] is a form of baldness for which there is no help or remedy at all.

THEN SHALL HE BE SHAVEN, BUT ‘V’ETH HANETHEK’ (THE SCALL) SHALL HE NOT SHAVE. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse warns that he should not use a razor on the place of the <i>nethek</i>, for even though there is no hair on it, yet if he passes the razor over it the skin will be scratched causing hair to grow in it; for such is the nature of people who have scabs on their heads, and all those who make their hair to fall off, to scratch the place on the head and also to make certain cuts in it with a knife.<br>But in the Torath Kohanim the Sages interpreted the verse as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 9:7.</i> “<i>But the ‘nethek’ shall he not shave</i>. But what is there to shave there?” That is to say, has not the hair fallen off from it? [So what need is there for Scripture to warn him not to shave it?] “Rather, the verse means, <i>around</i> the <i>nethek</i> he is not to shave. How can we explain this? He shaves the space outside it, but leaves [a circle] of two hairs [width] next to the <i>nethek</i>, so that it should be possible to discern if it spreads.” It is this which Onkelos translated: “and he shall shave around the scall, and that which is within the scall he shall not shave,” for he is to leave on all its sides a row of two hairs in order to recognize [at the end of seven days] if the <i>nethek</i> has spread [in which case the priest will pronounce him impure]. And the meaning of the word <i>v’eth</i> [<i>v’eth hanethek</i>] is then like the expression, <i>and David came near ‘eth’ the people, and he saluted them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 30:21.</i> which means that he came near them but he did not enter into their midst. [Here too it would mean, “and ‘in’ the <i>nethek</i> itself he shall not shave.”] Or it may be that the meaning of <i>v’eth</i> is like <i>im</i> (with), with the word <i>asher</i> (which) missing, the verse thus stating: “and that [i.e., the hair] which is ‘with’ the <i>nethek</i> he shall not shave.” There are many such cases in Scripture.

AND WHEN THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IS IN A GARMENT. This is not in the natural order of things, nor does it ever happen in the world [outside Israel], and similarly leprosy of houses<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 14:33-53.</i> [is not a natural phenomenon]. But when Israel is wholly devoted to G-d, then His spirit is upon them always, to maintain their bodies, clothes and houses in a good appearance. Thus as soon as one of them commits a sin or transgression, a deformity appears in his flesh, or on his garment, or in his house, revealing that G-d has turned aside from him. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <i>And I shall put the plague of leprosy in a house of the Land of your possession</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14:34.</i> meaning that it is G-d’s punishment upon that house. Thus [the law of leprosy of houses] applies only in the Land which is <i>the inheritance of the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 20:19. See Vol. I, pp. 250-251, and Ramban further, Leviticus 18:25.</i> even as He said, <i>When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14:34.</i> Now the reason [why this law does not apply outside the Land of Israel] is not because it is a duty which attaches to the ground<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">The general rule is: “Any religious duty that does not depend on the Land [but affects personal conduct], must be observed whether in the Land [of Israel] or outside it, and any religious duty that depends on the land, is to be observed in the Land [of Israel] alone, etc.” (Kiddushin 36b-37a). Ramban is now pointing out that the reason why the law of leprosy in houses does not apply outside the Land of Israel is not because it attaches to the land, but for the reason etc.</i>, but the reason is because this matter [of Divine indication of sins] occurs only in the Chosen Land, wherein the Glorious Name dwells. And in the Torath Kohanim the Sages further interpreted<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 5:3.</i> that a house does not contract impurity until after the conquest and division [of the Land by Israel], and until after each and every individual clearly knows his portion. The reason for this law is that only then do they have the ease of mind to know the Eternal, and the Divine Glory dwells among them. I think similarly with reference to the law of leprosy in garments, that it applies only in the Land [of Israel], it being unnecessary to exclude [the application of this law] in places outside the Land, since they never occur there. For this reason also the law of leprosy in garments applies only to white garments, not to colored ones, because the color might perhaps have extracted this unclean phenomenon [i.e., the leprosy] in that place [in the garment] in a natural way, and it will then not be regarded as <i>a finger of G-d</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 8:15.</i> Therefore garments colored by Heaven can contract impurity, according to the words of Rabbi Shimon.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Negaim 11:3.</i> And by way of the simple meaning of Scripture, the reason why it repeats in every verse the expression “<i>the garment, or the skin, or the wrap and the woof</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">See Verses 49, 51, 52, 53, 56, 57, 58, 59.</i> is because the matter is miraculous.

FOR IT IS A LEPROSY THAT IS ‘MAM’ERETH’ (FRETTING). “<i>Mam’ereth</i> is an expression of <i>‘silon mam’ir’</i> (<i>a pricking brier</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 28:24.</i> The Midrashic interpretation is:<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, Negaim 14:11.</i> attach a <i>me’eirah</i> (curse) to it — so that you will have no benefit from it.” This is Rashi’s language.

Rabbi Abohu said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: All things which must be burnt, one may derive benefit from their ashes, except for the ashes of an idol. Rabbi Chiya the son of Yosei asked Rabbi Yochanan: ‘There is the case of the ashes of a house [affected with leprosy], which is not related to idolatry, and yet you say that the ashes thereof are forbidden for any use [like the stones which have been turned into lime or plaster]!

THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER IN THE DAY OF HIS CLEANSING: HE SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTO THE PRIEST. Scripture is stating that this shall be the law of the leper in the day that he wishes to be pronounced pure, that he should be brought to the priest, as he can never attain purity except by means of the priest’s word. Then [in the following verse] Scripture tells that <i>the priest shall go forth to</i> the place of his [the leper’s] habitation <i>out of the camp</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> but he [the leper] is not to come to the priest even though his leprosy has been healed.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since the plague is a form of punishment, (see Ramban above, 13:47), the priest’s visit to his habitation on the day that the affliction of leprosy is healed is an indication that his repentance has been accepted. Hence the Torah commands the priest to go to the person who had suffered the affliction, and not the other way (Klei Yakar).</i> The interpretation thereof in the Torath Kohanim is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 1:3.</i> “<i>And he shall be brought unto the priest</i>, this means that he is not to wait.” If so, Scripture is stating that on the same day that he is cleansed, [meaning] that he is cured from his leprosy,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There is thus a distinct difference between the first interpretation, and that of the Torath Kohanim. At first we explained <i>b’yom tahoratho</i> (<i>on the day of his cleansing</i>) as meaning: “on the day that he is to be pronounced clean, he is to be brought to the priest, for no one else can so pronounce him” (see Note 46 in <i>Seder Tazria</i>). But according to the Torath Kohanim the verse means: “on the day he is actually ‘cleansed’ of the sickness, i.e., on the day that he is physically healed of the affliction, there must be no delay and he is to be brought before the priest.”</i> he is to be brought even against his will to the priest. Similarly, the verses, <i>And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 15:13.</i> <i>But if she be cleansed of her issue</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 28.</i> mean when [the issues] will cease and the persons become cleansed of them, as I have explained [i.e., that the term “cleansing” in the verse before us means “the healing” of the leprosy, and the same meaning applies to “the cleansing,” of him or her that hath an issue]. This is the correct explanation.

THEN SHALL THE PRIEST COMMAND TO TAKE FOR HIM THAT IS TO BE CLEANSED TWO LIVING, CLEAN ‘TZIPORIM’ (BIRDS). “<i>Living</i>, this excludes birds which are <i>treifah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Treifah</i> according to the accepted opinion (see Note 9 below), is an animal or bird suffering from one of certain organic diseases from which it is bound to die within twelve months, even though it be ritually slaughtered. Thus the word <i>living</i> excludes a bird which will die from a disease. Ramban further on will comment on this point.</i> <i>Clean</i>, this excludes a bird unfit for food. Since the plagues of leprosy came as a punishment for slander, which is done by chattering, therefore Scripture required for the leper’s cleansing that he bring birds which always twitter with a chirping sound.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>Now in view of the fact that Rashi wrote, “<i>Clean</i>, this excludes a bird which is unfit for food,” we can deduce that the [unqualified] term <i>tziporim</i> does not denote a permissible species of birds, but is instead a generic term for all birds [those permissible as food and those forbidden]. If so, the question appears: what is this “chirping” that they found [among the <i>tziporim</i>]? For there are many birds among which <i>there is none that openeth the mouth, or chirpeth</i>!<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 10:14.</i> Moreover, the interpretation [which Rashi quoted]: “<i>Living</i>, this excludes birds which are <i>treifah</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Treifah</i> according to the accepted opinion (see Note 9 below), is an animal or bird suffering from one of certain organic diseases from which it is bound to die within twelve months, even though it be ritually slaughtered.

Thus the word <i>living</i> excludes a bird which will die from a disease. Ramban further on will comment on this point.</i> can survive, this interpretation [of Rashi] is not correct. And in the Torath Kohanim we find this interpretation:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 1:12.</i> “<i>Living</i>, not slaughtered. <i>Clean</i>, not unfit for food. <i>Clean</i>, not <i>treifoth</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In his commentary to the Torath Kohanim, Malbim explains this text as follows: “First [the Tanna of this Beraitha] explains the simple meaning of the verse, saying: ‘<i>Living</i> means not slaughtered; <i>clean</i> means not unfit for food.’ Then [the Tanna] says that according to the Midrash thereof, <i>clean</i> means not <i>treifah</i>, since that it may not be of a forbidden species, we know already from the word <i>tzipor</i>. This Sage further holds that a <i>treifah</i> can survive, and therefore birds which are <i>treifah</i> are not excluded by the word <i>living</i>,” but instead are excluded by the term <i>clean</i>.</i> Now the scholars who follow the simple meaning of Scripture<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra on this verse, and R’dak in his Book of Roots, under the root <i>tzipor</i>.</i> say that every kind of bird [whether permissible as food or forbidden] is called <i>tzipor</i>, as is evidenced by the verses which state: <i>‘tzipor’</i> (<i>the fowl</i>) <i>of the air, and the fish of the sea;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 8:9.</i> <i>every ‘tzipor’</i> (<i>bird</i>) <i>of every sort;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 7:14.</i> <i>And thou son of man … speak ‘l’tzipor’</i> (<i>unto the birds</i>) <i>of every sort</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 39:17.</i> Similarly, it says, <i>and ‘hatzipor’</i> (<i>the birds</i>) <i>he did not divide</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 15:10.</i> with reference to the turtle-doves and young pigeons<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9.</i> [which are permissible birds, thus proving that the term <i>tzipor</i> is used with reference to both permissible and forbidden birds].<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the term <i>tzipor</i> is a generic term for all small birds that rise early in the morning to chirp and to sing, the term being associated with the Aramaic word <i>tzaphra</i> (morning). Similarly, the expression <i>let him return v’yitzpor’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 7:3.</i> means, and arise “early in the morning.” The expression <i>‘tzipor’</i> (<i>the fowl of</i>) <i>the air</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 8:9.</i> is said with reference to these small birds, because it is mostly they that fly high in the air. <i>Every ‘tzipor’</i> (<i>bird</i>) <i>of every sort</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 7:14.</i> refers to two kinds, all the little ones and the big ones. <i>If a ‘kan tzipor’</i> (<i>bird’s nest</i>) <i>chance to be before thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:6.</i> speaks about the little ones which are many [and therefore likely to chance to be there], to teach that even when they are young, the finder must exercise mercy towards them. Similarly, <i>therein ‘tziporim’</i> (<i>the birds</i>) <i>make nests</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 104:17.</i> [means the little ones], for it is they that dwell on the boughs of the cedars of the Lebanon. <i>Speak ‘l’tzipor’</i> (<i>unto the birds</i>) <i>of every sort</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 39:17.</i> means that even the little ones should gather upon [the flesh of the mighty that have fallen in battle],<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 39:18.</i> for the big marauding birds will come by themselves. Similarly, <i>Wilt thou play with him</i> [the leviathan] <i>‘katzipor’</i> (<i>as with a bird</i>)? <i>Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Job 40:29.</i> [refers to the little birds], for it is the way of young boys to play with little birds. The language of the Sages also follows that usage: Any statue which bears in its hand a staff or <i>‘tzipor’</i> (a bird)<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Abodah Zarah 40 b. Now the emblem of the bird, as explained in the Gemara (41 a), is “a symbol that [the idol in question] causes itself to be caught like a bird on behalf of the entire world.” Hence the reference in the word <i>tzipor</i> must be to a small bird that can easily be caught. Rabbeinu Chananel explains the text of the Gemara in the following words: “he holds the whole world in his hand as one holds a bird.” Here too the reference is to a small bird that the holder can easily control in the palm of his hand.</i> [one may not derive any benefit from, since these objects indicate that the statue is worshipped as an idol]; “If a man wove into a garment one <i>sit’s</i> length of a Nazirite’s hair [from which one is forbidden to derive any benefit], the garment is to be burnt,”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Terumah 34 a. A <i>sit</i> is the distance between the tips of the outstretched thumb and forefinger.</i> [and when the Sages of the Gemara raised the question, “why is this small piece not neutralized by the larger part of the garment?” it was answered that this is a case where he wove into the garment “the form of] a <i>tziporta</i>” [a small bird, which made the whole garment more valuable, and therefore it is not neutralized by the larger part thereof, and hence must be burnt].<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>ibid.</i> From this too it is clear that the term <i>tzipor</i> denotes a small bird.</i> The Sages also speak of “<i>tziporoth</i> (birds of) the vineyard [however small].”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 90 a. The Mishnah there in speaking with reference to taking out any object from one domain to another on the Sabbath, states: “for <i>tziporoth</i> (birds of) the vineyard, whether alive or dead, [he is liable], however small [the size be].” It is thus clear that the word <i>tzipor</i> is used by the Sages to mean a small bird, which even when alive is “however small.”</i> They also said: “the meat of <i>tziporim</i> (birds) brings back a sickness to a sick man [who is recovering, and makes it worse”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Berachoth 57 b. Having proven that the term <i>tzipor</i> refers to a small bird, Ramban now begins to elucidate further that it means both a permissible and forbidden species of bird. Here in the text of Berachoth it definitely means a permissible bird, but further it will be shown that it may mean also a forbidden bird.</i> thus indicating that the term <i>tzipor</i> refers to a bird which one may eat]. Scripture further states, <i>All ‘tzipor’</i> (<i>birds</i>) <i>that are clean ye may eat</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14:11.</i> meaning all these many species of [permissible] birds, thus including [the living bird sent away by] the leper [into the open field<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> as permissible food],<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban here alludes to a question that was raised in the Gemara (Chullin 140 a), as to whether the living bird of the leper that is sent into the open field is permissible to be eaten if caught by someone. To this the answer was given that one is permitted to eat it; for since the Torah stated <i>‘All’ birds that are clean ye may eat</i> (Deuteronomy 14:11), meaning any bird of a permissible species that is found may be eaten, now if the living bird of the leper were forbidden to be eaten, the Torah would not command the bird to be sent off, as this could involve a possible offense [since if the bird were not in fact permitted to be eaten, one might catch it without knowing that it had been used by the leper, and eat it]! Now, concludes Ramban, this permission is based in the Talmud on the word ‘all’ (‘<i>All birds</i> etc.) as explained above. This proves that the word <i>tzipor</i>, such as found here in the text before us, does not of itself only mean a permissible kind of bird. Rather, since it is a term for both the permissible and forbidden kind, it was therefore necessary for the Torath Kohanim here to establish that the leper’s bird must be of a permissible species, from the word <i>clean</i> qualifying <i>tziporim</i>.</i> by means of the word <i>kol</i> (<i>‘All’ birds that are clean ye may eat</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14:11.</i> And the verse which states, <i>But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture, and the osprey</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14:12. Having established that the word <i>tzipor</i> means “a small” bird, whether of a permissible or forbidden kind, Ramban finds this verse difficult, since the expression <i>of them</i> [in translation of the verse: “of which”] apparently refers back to <i>‘kol tzipor’</i> (<i>birds</i>) mentioned in the previous verse [11], and yet it mentions here (in Verse 12) big birds like the great vulture, etc. In addition, the word <i>tzipor</i> in Verse 11 is explicitly qualified by the word <i>‘t’horah,’</i> thus excluding the great vulture. Ramban’s answer follows in the text, where he explains that the expression <i>of them</i> does not refer back to <i>‘kol tzipor’</i> (<i>all birds</i>) previously mentioned, but rather means “of their flesh,” i.e., the flesh of these big birds about to be mentioned — the great vulture, etc.</i> is [to be understood] as if it said, “and these are they, from the flesh of which ye may not eat.” It is for this reason [i.e., since the term <i>tzipor</i> includes both permissible and forbidden birds], that the Sages found it necessary to interpret:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 1:12.</i> “<i>Clean</i>, not forbidden birds” [but they would not have been able to derive it if the word <i>tziporim</i> had not been qualified]. In any case it is clear that <i>tziporim</i> are the small chirping birds. Similarly, <i>Yea, the ‘tzipor’ hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 84:4.</i> also indicates that the word <i>tzipor</i> is not a name for all birds [for otherwise why should the verse mention both <i>tzipor</i> and the swallow, if the term <i>tzipor</i> already includes all birds]. Likewise, <i>Wherein tziporim</i> (<i>the birds</i>) <i>make their nests, the stork makes the fir-tree her house</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 104:17.</i> [indicates that <i>tziporim</i> does not include all birds, since the verse proceeds also to mention some specific birds].<br>It would appear from the words of our Sages that all birds permissible as food are called <i>tzipor</i>, but the leper was commanded to bring <i>tziporei dror</i> [“free birds,” a term which, as explained further on means birds which live in the house as well as in the field], for we have been taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 5:13.</i> “<i>And he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open field</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 53.</i> Rabbi Yosei the Galilean said: ‘This means a bird that lives outside all cities. And what kind of bird is it? It is the bird called <i>dror</i>’” [the free bird that lives in the house as well as in the field]. It is on the basis of this interpretation of the Rabbis that they further mentioned [in connection with the leper’s birds] that they “chatter” [since it is usually these free birds which twitter].<br>It is possible that the requirement that the birds be of “the free” kind is a commandment [which is to be observed if possible, but is not indispensable], so that if it has already been done, they are all valid [whether free or unfree]. Therefore the Sages in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 1:12.</i> found it necessary to exclude forbidden bird’s [which do not possess this characteristic of living in the house and in the field]. And so we have been taught in a Mishnah of Tractate Negaim:<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Negaim 14:1.</i> “And he [the leper] brought two birds that are of the free type of bird.” And it is furthermore taught there:<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5.</i> “It is a commandment that the two birds of the leper should be alike in appearance, in size and in value, and that they should be brought at the same time. Yet even if they are not alike, they are valid. If one was slaughtered and it was found that it was not a ‘free bird,’ he should buy a partner for the second one.” The reason [why he must buy a partner for the second one] although [as we have said above] if it has already been done, all birds [whether free or unfree] are valid, is that if they were of two different kinds [as in this case, where the slaughtered one was a non-<i>dror</i>, and the living one a <i>dror</i>], they <i>are</i> invalid. And in the Chapter <i>Eilu Treifoth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">“These are accounted <i>treifah</i>” among cattle. It is the third chapter of Tractate Chullin. The text quoted here is found there on 62 a. For the word <i>treifah</i>, see above, Note 7.</i> the Sages of the Gemara have said: “A bird which scratches, is valid to be used for the purification of the leper. This is the white-bellied swallow concerning which Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages differed” [as explained further on]. From these texts [it is clear] that the birds for the purification of the leper are not limited to one species, and that the purification is not to be done with <i>any</i> permissible bird, but rather the commandment is that it be done only with those birds that are <i>dror</i>, that is to say, “which live in the house as well as in the field.”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 106 b.</i> Therefore the Rabbis said [in the above-quoted text] with reference to the white-bellied swallow, that since according to the Sages it is a bird which may be eaten, it is also valid for the purification of the leper, as it is included within [the category of those birds that are] <i>dror</i> [living in the house as well as in the field]. Yet nonetheless <i>all</i> permissible birds [even those that are not “free birds”] are valid, if the purification of the leper has already been done with them, since they are all included within the phrase, <i>two living clean birds</i>.<br>And we have been taught in the Sifre:<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, <i>R’eih</i> 103. See in <i>Seder Vayikra</i> Note 121, on Sifre.</i> “Rabbi Yashiyah said: ‘Wherever it says in Scripture <i>tzipor</i>, it speaks of a permissible bird.’ Said Rabbi Yitzchak: ‘A permissible bird is called <i>oph</i> (fowl) and also <i>tzipor</i> (bird), but a forbidden one is only called <i>oph</i>.” Similarly the Rabbis mentioned also in the Gemara [of Tractate Chullin], in the Chapter <i>Shilu’ach Hakan</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">“The letting of [the dam] go from the nest.” It is the twelfth chapter of Tractate Chullin, discussing the law stated in Deuteronomy 22:6-7. The text quoted here is found there on p. 140 a.</i> where they resolved that the term <i>living</i> [<i>two ‘living’ clean birds</i>] means “the ends of whose limbs ‘live’ (exist), thus excluding birds from whom a limb is missing.” Similarly [permissible] birds which are <i>treifah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Treifah</i> according to the accepted opinion (see Note 9 below), is an animal or bird suffering from one of certain organic diseases from which it is bound to die within twelve months, even though it be ritually slaughtered. Thus the word <i>living</i> excludes a bird which will die from a disease. Ramban further on will comment on this point.</i> are invalid [for the purification of the leper]. The Rabbis also interpreted there<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">“The letting of [the dam] go from the nest.” It is the twelfth chapter of Tractate Chullin, discussing the law stated in Deuteronomy 22:6-7. The text quoted here is found there on p. 140 a.</i> the term <i>clean</i> [<i>two living ‘clean’ birds</i>] to exclude those birds which are of a permissible species but are forbidden to be eaten [for some special reason], such as birds belonging to a person of a city that went astray,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 13:16-18, that all the belongings thereof are to be destroyed.</i> or a fowl that killed a human being, or those that have been exchanged for an idol.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if one received birds of a permissible species as payment for an idol, they are nonetheless forbidden for <i>any</i> use, just as the original idol may not be made any use of.</i> This interpretation was derived by the Sages from the very language itself, since the term <i>tzipor</i> denotes only a permissible bird. It is clear then from this text, that all permissible birds [whether they are of the dror-type or not] are included within the category of <i>tzipor</i>.<br>I have further seen in the Yerushalmi of Tractate Nazir<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi Nazir I, 1. — To understand the name “‘Yerushalmi of Nazir,” it is important to note that after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi — also known as Rabbeinu Hakadosh — in the Land of Israel [about the year 200 of Common Era] it formed, the basis of study in all academies of learning. But whereas hitherto all the great Yeshivoth were concentrated in the Land of Israel, after the completion of the Mishnah two groups of Yeshivoth came into prominence: those of the Land of Israel, and those of Babylon. Thus for a number of generations there existed side by side two groups of academies where the Mishnah was studied and interpreted. In the course of time, the continuous Roman persecutions forced the closing of the Palestinian schools of learning; but before they were finally closed, the Rabbis compiled their teachings in what is known as the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i> i.e., the Jerusalem Talmud. The academies in Babylon flourished for many centuries longer. Their teachings were later compiled [about the year 475 of Common Era] and are known as the Babylonian Talmud. To this day Talmudic study is almost exclusively devoted to the Babylonian Talmud, so that any tractate of the Talmud generally cited, is that of the Babylonian Talmud, unless specified as in the case before us: “the Yerushalmi of Tractate” so-and-so. A tradition has it that after the redaction of the Jerusalem Talmud, its Sages went down as a group to Babylon, and most of their teachings were incorporated into the text of the Babylonian Talmud. This explains why Talmudic study throughout the ages was concentrated almost entirely upon the Babylonian Talmud, while only the outstanding Rabbis of the generations devoted their studies also to the Jerusalem Talmud.</i> that the Sages of the Gemara said: “But does an impure Nazirite really bring <i>tziporim</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The question refers back to a statement in the Mishnah which reads: “If a person said, ‘I pledge myself to offer <i>tziporim</i> (birds),’ Rabbi Meir says that he becomes a Nazirite etc.” The reason for this opinion of Rabbi Meir was explained there in the Gemara by Resh Lakish, that it is because a Nazirite whose consecration has been defiled, must bring <i>tziporim</i> as an atonement (Numbers 6:9-11). On this explanation of Resh Lakish, the Gemara asked: “But does a Nazirite really bring <i>tziporim</i>? It is turtle-doves or young pigeons that he brings!” In other words, <i>tziporim</i> means birds which are of a forbidden kind, while the Nazirite must bring birds which are permissible to be eaten! So how could the reason Resh Lakish advanced to explain Rabbi Meir’s opinion be correct, since <i>tziporim</i> (forbidden birds) are not used at all by a Nazirite! — Ramban is thus beginning at this point to refute his own explanation which he had set forth, namely, that <i>tzipor</i> refers only to a permissible bird, since it is evident from the Yerushalmi that <i>tzipor</i> means a forbidden bird! The final solution of the Yerushalmi follows.</i> It is turtle-doves or young pigeons that he brings! [To this question the reply was made:] ‘There are some authorities who teach that all edible birds are called <i>tziporim</i>, and there are other authorities that teach that all birds, whether permissible or forbidden, are called <i>tziporim</i>.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Hence he who said, “I pledge myself to offer <i>tziporim</i>, becomes a Nazirite even according to those authorities that hold that the term <i>tziporim</i> denotes all kinds of birds, permissible ones or forbidden ones, for since it also denotes permissible birds, his intention was those birds that may be brought upon the altar (P’nei Moshe).</i> Thus we are now left with a divergence of opinion [as to what the term <i>tzipor</i> denotes]! Yet it is possible that the name applies only to the small birds. This appears so in the Gemara from what the Rabbis have said in Tractate Sotah:<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah 16 b.</i> [In the process of his purification the leper is commanded to] “bring a sufficient amount of water that the bird’s blood may remain discernible in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5 here reads: <i>And the priest shall command that one of the birds shall be slaughtered in an earthen vessel over running water</i>. On this the Sages commented that the vessel must contain just enough water that the blood of the bird is discernible in it. And how much etc. (see text).</i> And how much is this? The fourth of a <i>log</i>.” Upon this the Sages queried: “If the bird was a large one so that the blood thereof ‘pushed away’ the water [so that it was imperceptible], or the bird was a small one so that its blood was ‘pushed away’ by the water [so that the blood was indiscernible], what is the ruling on these cases?” On these questions [the Rabbis of the Talmud] explained: “All standard measures laid down by the Sages were fixed with precision. The Sages estimated with reference to a ‘free bird’ that you will not find one so big that the blood thereof will ‘push away’ the water, nor will you find one so small that the blood thereof will be ‘pushed away’ by the water.” Now if all kinds of permissible birds were valid for [the purification of the leper], there are some birds the blood of which would “push away” many <i>logim</i> of water! Perhaps the Sages established the above standard only with reference to a “free bird” which one is commanded to bring if this is possible, according to the interpretation of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See text of Ramban above, quoting the Torath Kohanim at Note 34.</i> [but if the purification has already been done with a large bird, it is also valid]. It has already been mentioned in the Gemara:<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 29 a.</i> “Perhaps he saw a large <i>tziporo</i> (bird) and he called it <i>gamal</i> (camel).”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This text clearly shows that the term <i>tzipor</i> includes also large birds, and hence the above-mentioned explanation that it refers only to small birds is incorrect.</i><br>The correct [and final] conclusion which emerges from all this discussion is that we say on the basis of this interpretation<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See text of Ramban above, quoting the Torath Kohanim at Note 34.</i> that any bird which is not a “free one” is invalid for the purification of the leper, even if the purification has already been done, since in the Mishnah thereof<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5.</i> it was not taught: “It is a commandment [to be fulfilled if possible] that the birds should be ‘free birds,’ but even if they were not ‘free birds,’ they are valid,” as it taught concerning the requirement of equality [in appearance, size and value, that “even if they are not alike, they are valid”]; also, the correct conclusion is that all birds that are “free birds” are those that chatter. And that which the Rabbis said in the Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 1:12.</i> “<i>Clean</i>, not those forbidden as food,”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s meaning is as follows. On this exclusion of forbidden birds by the Torath Kohanim one might ask: “Since, as we have now established, the <i>dror</i>-characteristic of the bird is indispensable in the purification of the leper, meaning that if the birds did not have this quality of living in the house as well as in the field, the purification is invalid even if already done, why was it necessary for the Torath Kohanim to point to a special Scriptural source for the exclusion of forbidden birds; for such birds are not of the kind that live in the house as well as in the field, and we have said that if the birds lack this characteristic, the purification is invalid?” Ramban answers that we must perforce say that even among forbidden birds there <i>are</i> some species that do have this characteristic of being able to live in the house as well as in the field, and hence it was necessary for the Torath Kohanim to exclude them by means of a special expression in the verse.</i> is because even among the forbidden birds there are some species that possess this quality of <i>dror</i> [living in the house as well as in the field], such as the white-bellied swallow according to Rabbi Eliezer.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned above in the text, at Note 38.</i> Or perhaps the meaning of the Torath Kohanim is that it excludes those birds [whose prohibition is not because they belong to the forbidden species, but because of special circumstances] which make them “forbidden to you,” such as those birds which are nonetheless forbidden [as food or benefit, because they belonged to a person of a city that had gone astray,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 13:16-18, that all the belongings thereof are to be destroyed.</i> or those that have been exchanged for an idol],<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if one received birds of a permissible species as payment for an idol, they are nonetheless forbidden for <i>any</i> use, just as the original idol may not be made any use of.</i> or those which are <i>treifah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Treifah</i> according to the accepted opinion (see Note 9 below), is an animal or bird suffering from one of certain organic diseases from which it is bound to die within twelve months, even though it be ritually slaughtered. Thus the word <i>living</i> excludes a bird which will die from a disease. Ramban further on will comment on this point.</i> just as the Rabbis resolved in the Gemara in the Chapter <i>Shilu’ach Hakan</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">“The letting of [the dam] go from the nest.” It is the twelfth chapter of Tractate Chullin, discussing the law stated in Deuteronomy 22:6-7. The text quoted here is found there on p. 140 a.</i> This is the correct interpretation in my eyes. In the Agadah of the [Midrash] Rabbah we find this statement:<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 16:7.</i> “Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Simon said: These birds [brought by the leper for his purification] are noisy ones, symbolic of he who speaks slander [and as a punishment for which, the slanderer is stricken with leprosy]. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Let that which is accompanied by sound [namely, these noisy birds] come to bring atonement for the evil sound [of the slanderer].’ And Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Levi said: The birds [brought by the leper for his purification] are of the ‘free kind’ [that live in the house as well as in the field] and thus ate of the leper’s bread and drank of his water. Now the following statement follows logically with stronger reason etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">“If these birds that ate of his bread and drank of his water, effect atonement for the leper, how much more so do the priests who enjoy twenty-four kinds of gifts, effect atonement for Israel!” (<i>Ibid.</i>).</i>
AND CEDAR-WOOD, AND SCARLET, AND HYSSOP. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that “[the cedar-wood and the hyssop] represent the tallest and the lowest in species of vegetation, as is evidenced by the words of wisdom of Solomon.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And he</i> [Solomon] <i>spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall</i> (I Kings 5:13). The inference is clearly that Solomon’s wisdom encompassed all vegetation, from highest to lowest.</i> Thus the law of the leper and the law of the house stricken with leprosy and the [law of] impurity [conveyed by] a corpse are closely related,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In each of these cases the cedar-wood and the hyssop are requirements in the process of purification. See further, 14:52 for the purification of a house that had been affected by leprosy, and Numbers 19:6 and 18, for the purification from the impurity conveyed by a corpse.</i> and they resemble the Passover in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:22. There the hyssop was required in the sprinkling of the blood upon the lintel and the two side-posts, so that the destroyer would not come into the Israelite houses. — Ibn Ezra is thus intimating that in the cases of leprosy and impurity of a corpse, the purification was a sign that the destroyer would no longer approach that person or house, just as was its function in Egypt (Ezra L’havin).</i> And the meaning of the expression <i>into the open field</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> is to an uninhabitated place, so that no infection might be caused.” [Thus far are the words of Ibn Ezra.].<br>And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 2:5.</i> “<i>Into the open field</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> this means that he is not to stand in Joppa [which is on the sea] and let it go into the sea, nor is he to stand in Gabbath [a city which is on the edge of the desert] and let it go into the desert.” Now if so, [that he may not let it go into the sea or into the desert], then the reason why it is sent into the open field is like the secret of the goat sent to Azazel,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:10.</i> except that there it is sent <i>for Azazel into the wilderness</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:10.</i> and here it is sent to the flying [destructive spirits] of the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See my Hebrew commentary, p. 80.</i> I will yet explain this with the help of G-d.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 16:8.</i>

AND IT SHALL BE ON THE SEVENTH DAY, THAT HE SHALL SHAVE ALL HIS HAIR, HIS HEAD AND HIS BEARD AND HIS EYEBROWS, EVEN ALL HIS HAIR HE SHALL SHAVE OFF. “This is a general principle [<i>he shall shave all his head</i>] followed by an enumeration of particulars [already comprehended in the general proposition, i.e., <i>his head</i> etc.] and [this again is followed by] a generalization [<i>all his hair he shall shave off</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Such a Scriptural statement is governed by the rule enunciated by Rabbi Yishmael [in his “Thirteen exegetical principles by which the Torah is expounded”], that the generalizations can include only such new particulars as are similar to those particulars specified.

See my Hebrew commentary, p. 80.</i> “<i>And he shall shave off all his hair</i>. I might think this includes the hidden parts of the body; Scripture therefore states, <i>his eyebrows</i>. Just as the eyebrows are visible, so also [the expression] <i>all his hair</i> refers only to visible parts of the body, thus excluding hair which is in the hidden parts of the body. If so I might think, just as the eyebrows are in a place where there is a visible collection of hair, so we are to include [only] those places where there is a visible collection of hair. Whence do I know to include [in the commandment of shaving his hair] an invisible collection of hair [such as under the armpits, and between the legs], or a visible scattering of hair [such as on the stomach or ribs] or an invisible scattering of hair [such as the hair in the folds of the body]? Scripture therefore says, <i>even all his hair he shall shave off</i>.” However, the Rabbi [Rashi] followed the interpretation of Rabbi Yishmael,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Such a Scriptural statement is governed by the rule enunciated by Rabbi Yishmael [in his “Thirteen exegetical principles by which the Torah is expounded”], that the generalizations can include only such new particulars as are similar to those particulars specified.

So also have we been taught in a Mishnah [like Rabbi Akiba]:<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Negaim 14:2.</i> “He passed the razor over the whole of his body,” and it is further explained in the second chapter of Tractate Sotah.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah 16 a.</i>

AND THE REST OF THE OIL THAT IS IN THE PRIEST’S HAND HE SHALL PUT UPON THE HEAD OF HIM TO BE CLEANSED; AND THE PRIEST SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIM BEFORE THE ETERNAL. This atonement is accomplished by means of the priest’s acts with the blood of the guilt-offering [as prescribed in Verse 14] and the oil [as set forth in Verses 15-18]. Similarly, the verse stating [in connection with a leper who is poor], <i>to make atonement for him before the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 29.</i> [carries the same meaning]. And in the Torath Kohanim we find it said:<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 3:12.</i> “<i>And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, and the priest shall make atonement</i>. ‘If he put [the rest of the oil upon his head], he effected atonement for him, and if he did not put it thereon, he did not effect atonement.’ These are the words of Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Yochanan the son of Nuri said: ‘This is the <i>residue</i> of a commandment, [and therefore is not part of the commandment itself, and thus not indispensable]; whether he put it thereon or did not put it thereon, he has effected atonement.’” Now if so, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan the son of Nuri, the expression <i>and the priest shall make atonement for him</i>, refers [only] to the guilt-offering [which <i>is</i> indispensable in the final purification of the leper].<br>Now Scripture states [here] in the case of the guilt-offering, <i>and the priest shall make atonement</i>, and then states again in the case of the sin-offering, <i>and he shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i> and with reference to the burnt-offering and meal-offering it also states, <i>and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i> But we do not know the purport of all these expressions of atonement. Perhaps the guilt-offering effects atonement for the trespass that he committed before he was affected by his plague, and the sin-offering effects atonement for his sin which he committed during the time of the plague.

The burnt-offering and meal-offering constitute a ransom for his soul, that he be worthy to be purified and return to his dwelling. Therefore He said, <i>and the priest shall make atonement for him, ‘and he shall be clean</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i><br>Now in the Torath Kohanim it is stated:<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 3:13.</i> “<i>And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i> Why is this said?<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., why does it say here, <i>and he shall make atonement</i>, when at the end of the section (in Verse 20) it concludes, <i>and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean</i>?

Or it may be that he spoke to them in the place of [i.e., as representing] all Israel, and hinted that the intention [of giving the commandment] now is merely to teach them all the laws of leprosy, and that they in turn should teach them to the priests, and Moses did not warn all Israel now [about these laws, as they did not apply until they came into the Land].

AND IF THE PLAGUE RETURN AND BREAK OUT IN THE HOUSE. Now this plague which came in the other stones and in the other mortar [which replaced the original ones], is not identical with the first plague which was there, [but is a different outbreak]. It is thus unlike the “breaking out” of the leprosy mentioned in the case of a person<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 13:12; 20.</i> and the spreading thereof, which mean that the plague returned to its former natural place, since the pus many times hides under the skin and retreats into the interior of the body, and afterwards it returns and spreads to the skin on its outside. Rather, the matter [of leprosy in a house] is as I have written in <i>Seder Ishah Ki Thazria</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 13:47.</i> that it is a plague and Divine intervention implying that <i>the evil spirit from G-d</i><sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 16:16.</i> is in that place. And in the Torath Kohanim the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 7:1.</i> “<i>And if the plague come again, and break out in the house</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 43.</i> This is like saying, ‘That person has returned to his place.’” The meaning of the Sages is to state that the expression <i>‘u’parach’</i> (<i>and it break out</i>) mentioned here [in connection with leprosy in a house], does not mean “spreading out” as it does in the verse [dealing with leprosy of a man], <i>And if the leprosy ‘paro’ach tiphrach’</i> (<i>break out abroad</i>) <i>in the skin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 13:12.</i> but here it denotes a [fresh] outbreak in that place just like the expression, <i>the rod of Aaron ‘parach’</i> (<i>was budded</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 17:23.</i> The comparison that the Rabbis drew [i.e., that this is like saying, “That person has returned to his place”], is to allude to the matter we have stated, namely, that this is not a plague which comes into existence and spreads out [as in the case of leprosy of man], but is one outbreak after another, just like a man who left his place and then came back to sit in his former place, on a different chair which was prepared for him there. I have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 13:47.</i> the meaning of this “breaking out” [of leprosy in a house], as well as of the “breaking out” of leprosy in garments.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 13:57.</i><br>Now Scripture does not state here, “and if the plague comes back, and breaks out ‘in those stones’” [but instead it says, <i>and breaks out ‘in the house’</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 43.</i> for even if it broke out in another place of the house, and even if it was of another color, unlike that of the first plague, it is considered a recurring plague [i.e., one that recurs after removal of the stones, scraping and replastering, which necessitates the demolition of the house], and is not considered a plague appearing for the first time in the house. This is the sense of the expression <i>in the house</i> [<i>and if the plague come again, and break out ‘in the house’</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 43.</i> meaning that wherever it recurs in the house, it is governed by that law [which requires the demolition of the house]. The reason for this is that the evil spirit will not depart from that house, but will always be in one of the places in that house, to frighten its owners. So also the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Metzora</i> 7:1; 3.</i> I know only that [the house is to be demolished] if the plague returns to its former place. Whence do I know to include a return to any place in the house? Scripture therefore says, <i>in the house</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 43.</i> I know only that this rule applies if the plague recurs in its original color. Whence do I know that even if it recurs in a different color [it is governed by the same rule]? Scripture therefore says, <i>and it break out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 43.</i> [meaning, in its original color or a different one].<br>Now the meaning of these verses according to the interpretation [of the Torath Kohanim] is as follows. <i>And if the plague come again</i> on the seventh day and returns <i>in the house, after that the stones have been taken out, and after the house hath been scraped, and after it is plastered</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 43.</i> or<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The expression <i>u’va hakohein</i> of Verse 44, which is generally translated “<i>‘and’</i> the priest shall come,” Ramban interprets to mean “‘or’ the priest shall come.” See further, Note 95, on the significance of this interpretation.</i> <i>the priest shall come</i> a second time <i>and see, and, behold</i>, that now <i>the plague has recurred</i><sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word is <i>pasah</i>, which is generally translated as “spread.” But Ramban has already explained above that in this section dealing with leprosy of a house, the term means “recur” and not “spread.” See Note 95.</i> <i>in the house</i> as it was at first, <i>it is malignant leprosy … and he shall break down the house</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 45.</i> the two verses thus explaining that whether the plague recurred at the end of the first week or at the end of the second week, they are governed by one law [which requires the demolition of the house].<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban thus avoids a great exegetical difficulty which Rashi found in these verses. Principally it is as follows: Verse 44 states: <i>And the priest shall come and see, and, behold, the plague be ‘pasah’ in the house, it is a malignant leprosy; it is unclean</i>. This is followed by Verse 45 which states: <i>And he shall break down the house</i> etc. Now Rashi, who interpreted the word <i>pasah</i> here in Verse 44 in the same way as in leprosy of man, meaning that “it spread out,” found this difficulty: since the Rabbis have said that every plague that recurs in a house after the removal of stones, scraping and replastering, is a sign of impurity, and requires the whole house to be demolished, why then does the verse state here <i>pasah</i>, since the same law applies even if the plague did not spread out? Accordingly Rashi transposed the order of the verses, placing Verse 45 [<i>And he shall break down the house …</i>] after Verse 43 [<i>And if the plague come again …</i>], and Verse 44 [<i>And the priest shall come …</i>] after Verses 46 and 47 [<i>and he that eateth in the house …</i>]. Ramban later remarks that this transposition of the verses is like “cutting the verses with a knife.” Ramban on the other hand explained the verses on these two premises: (a) the term <i>pasah</i> in this section on leprosy of a house, means “recur,” and not “spread.” (b) <i>‘u’va hakohein’</i> in Verse 44 does not mean “<i>then</i> the priest shall come,” or “<i>and</i> the priest shall come,” but rather “<i>or</i> the priest shall come.” Thus Verse 43 speaks of the recurrence of the plague at the end of the <i>first</i> week [after the removal of the stones etc.], and Verse 44 speaks of the case when it recurred at the end of the <i>second</i> week. In each of these cases the law is as stated in Verse 45: <i>And he shall break down the house …</i> Thus according to Ramban all the verses are in order. The text of Ramban which follows sets forth this exposition in more detail.</i> Scripture did not need to say [in Verse 44] “<i>and the priest shall come and see, if the plague be ‘pasah’</i> (<i>have recurred</i>) <i>in the house</i> — he shall then command that they take out the stones” etc., [as Rashi would have it],<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Since Rashi explained the word <i>pasah</i> as “spreading,” he was also forced — besides transposing Verse 44 [<i>And the priest shall come and see …</i>] to follow after Verse 47 as mentioned above — to explain that if at the end of the second week after the house was shut up, the priest found that the plague has spread then Verse 40 (!) reapplies: <i>then the priest shall command that they take out the stones …</i> and he gives it another week. If it returns, he demolishes the house, and if it does not return, it is pure. [[illegible]] It is this re-introduction of Verse 40 here in the order of the verses that Ramban finds unnecessary, as explained in the text.</i> for this verse [<i>and the priest shall come …</i>] is connected with the verse [43] immediately preceding it, stating, <i>if the plague come again … after that the stones have been taken out</i> at the end of the first week or the second week, when the priest comes, and he sees its recurrence, <i>it is a malignant leprosy</i>. Then Scripture further states, <i>And if the priest shall come in</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 48.</i> that is, at the end of the second week mentioned above [in Verse 44], <i>and see it, and, behold, the plague hath not recurred</i><sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Here too (in Verse 48) the word is <i>pasah</i>, which Rashi would explain as “spread” or “extended” [and it is so rendered in most translations], but Ramban explains it as meaning “recur.”</i> <i>in the house, after that the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean</i>, since it is healed of the plague, that is to say, it did not recur. Thus we now derive the principle that if a plague remained as it was during the first week and the second week, he removes the stones, scrapes away and replasters, and gives it another week, and if the plague returns, he demolishes the house. This is the correct interpretation of the verses in accordance with the [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof, for it is impossible to cut them, so to say, with a knife<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Reference is to Rashi’s exposition of the verses. See above, Note 95.</i> placing later verses first and earlier verses later, in a manner which is not all their meaning.<br>It is further possible that we say as a correct interpretation of the verses on this subject, that the term <i>pasah</i> in this section [which deals with leprosy in a house], is like <i>parach</i>, both of them being an expression of “sprouting.” Where a plague exists already, the term <i>pasah</i> denotes its growth and extension, and where there is no plague, it means its [original] sprouting and [subsequent] recurrence, since it is all a matter of growth. Onkelos also has rendered all [expressions of <i>pasah</i>] as <i>oseiph</i> (adding), and the term <i>tosepheth</i> (addition) is used of a growing thing which is added to another, such as in the expressions: <i>‘v’nosaph gam hu’</i> (<i>they be added also</i>) <i>to our enemies;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 1:10.</i> <i>‘v’nosphah nachalathan’</i> (<i>then will their inheritance be added</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 36:4.</i> and it may also be used of a matter which “returns,” such as: <i>the Eternal ‘yosiph’</i> (<i>will set again</i>) <i>His hand;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 11:11.</i> <i>and they prophesied ‘v’lo yasaphu’</i> (<i>but they did so no more</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 11:25.</i> meaning that [Eldad and Meidad] did not prophesy any more. Thus the meaning of the term <i>pasah</i> is that the plague “returned.” Now after the removing of the stones, [scraping and replastering], when Scripture speaks of <i>pisayon</i> [as it does in Verse 44 and 48], the meaning thereof is “sprouting,” as I have mentioned in connection with the term <i>prichah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">In the beginning of this verse, in the text before Note 88.</i> If so, Scripture is stating: <i>and if the plague came again and ‘sprouted’ in the house, after that the stones have been taken out … and the priest shall come and see, and, behold the plague has ‘sprouted’ in the house … then he shall break down the house</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 43-45.</i> for every plague that returns is a sign of confirmed impurity. <i>And if the priest shall come in, and see that the plague has not ‘sprouted’</i> at all <i>in the house, after the house was plastered</i>, he shall pronounce it pure, <i>because the plague has been healed</i> by the removal of the stones, [scraping] and replastering.<br>Thus the law of a house wherein the plague recurs at the end of the first week has been explained here, that he removes the stones, scrapes and replasters, and gives it another week. If the plague returns the house is impure [and is to be demolished], and if it does not return it is pure. But where it remained at the end of the first week as it was [when he first saw it], and it recurred at the end of the second week, the law thereof was not explained in the Torah, but we derive it by means of a <i>gzeirah shavah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a similarity of phrases.” It is one of the Thirteen principles of exegesis established by Rabbi Yishmael, by which the Torah is expounded (see above, Note 64).

It is important to note in this connection that an analogy from such congruent expressions cannot be established of one’s own accord; it must be an authorized tradition that this similarity of phrases is to be applied, in order to establish such an analogy.</i> as follows: [the expression, <i>and behold if the plague recur</i> is found both in Verse 44: <i>and the priest shall come</i>, and in Verse 39: <i>and the priest shall return</i>, thus establishing that] “<i>coming</i> [in Verse 44] and <i>returning</i> [in Verse 39] are identical in regard to their law,” meaning that the law of “coming” which is stated at the end of the second week, is like the law of “returning” stated at the end of the first week, i.e., that in both cases if the plague recurred, he removes the stones, scrapes and replasters and gives it another week.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">This is clearly stated in Verse 40 with regard to the end of the first week. The above analogy establishes that the same law applies to the end of the second week, although it is not clearly specified.</i> Similarly, if the plague remained as it was [at the end of] the first and second weeks, and recurred [at the end of] the third week, the law thereof is not mentioned in the Torah, but it is derived by means of another <i>gzeirah shavah:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a similarity of phrases.” It is one of the Thirteen principles of exegesis established by Rabbi Yishmael, by which the Torah is expounded (see above, Note 64).

This is all predicated upon the interpretation of the term <i>pasah</i> as meaning “spreading” or “extending.” The phrase in the Torath Kohanim <i>hanach lo</i> (“Leave it”) is therefore interpreted as explained above [on the basis of the Rabad’s commentary there, which follows Rashi’s interpretation]. Ramban who has explained the term differently, as explained above in the text, is therefore bound to give a different interpretation of the expression in the Torath Kohanim, which now follows in the text: “That is to say, that we are to leave etc.”</i> That is to say, we are to leave here the plain meaning of the verse and follow the interpretation, but not that we are to uproot the verse from its place and explain it as referring to another place. This is what appears to me to be correct in the meaning of this Scriptural section, so that the words of the Sages be upheld, and it is a fitting and appealing interpretation.

AND WHOMSOEVER ‘HAZAV’ (HE THAT HATH THE ISSUE) TOUCHETH, WITHOUT HAVING RINSED HIS HANDS IN WATER, HE SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES, AND BATHE HIMSELF IN WATER, AND BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. Scripture calls the immersion [of the whole body of the impure object] “rinsing in water,”<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intention is to explain that in order that the <i>zav</i> become pure, he must immerse himself completely in water, this being implied in the term <i>shataph</i> (rinsing), as the following verse indicates. And the reason why Scripture uses the term “rinsing,” and why also it speaks here only of the hands having been rinsed, will be explained further on in the text.</i> as is indicated by the verse here stating, <i>and every vessel of wood</i> [touched by a <i>zav</i>] <i>shall be ‘rinsed’ in water</i><sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12.</i> [which means completely “immersed” in water], and similarly it calls the immersion of an [impure] garment “washing,” thus saying, <i>then it shall be ‘washed’ the second time, and shall be clean</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 13:58. Here too it does not mean merely washing the garment, but its immersion in a ritual pool.

This is as if the verse had said, “and whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth with his hands, and he hath not yet bathed himself in water on the day of his purification, he shall wash his clothes, [and be impure until the even].” Scripture had to use the term “rinsing,” in order to teach that the “bathing” it mentioned in the verse, <i>and he shall bathe his flesh in running water</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> should be by means of rinsing and rubbing, so as to remove anything interposing [between the water and his body], as I have explained. It would not have been correct for Scripture to say that “whomsoever he that has an issue touches, after having rinsed his hands in water, will <i>not</i> be rendered impure,” [from which we would deduce that if he has not rinsed his hands in water, he shall be impure, thus indicating that his impurity is conveyed through his fingers], for He has already said, that whoever <i>toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 7.</i> meaning any part of the <i>zav</i>, is impure, the same law applying to objects that he lies on<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> and rides on,<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9.</i> and anything on which he sat,<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 6.</i> until he is purified of his issue, <i>and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> Rather, Scripture [in using the term “rinsing”] alludes to his purification by means of complete immersion, as I have explained. And our Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Zavim</i> 4:5.</i> that Scripture expresses the immersion of the [whole] body of the <i>zav</i> by the term “rinsing of hands,” in order to teach you that the hidden parts of the body [such as the inside of the mouth, etc.] do not require “the coming of water” upon them, but only limbs which are visible, such as the hands.<br>The reason for the impurity of a man that suffers a flux is because it is a serious illness, and one of the contagious diseases. Therefore he requires an offering when healed in order to give thanks to G-d Who healed him and purified him [which is accomplished through the bird brought as a burnt-offering],<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verses 14-15.</i> and [in addition] he needs a sin-offering to effect atonement for his sin, so that it should not cause him any more sickness.<br>The reason for the impurity of semen,<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 16-18.</i> even though it is the nature of procreation, is analogous to the impurity of the dead, since the womb can be malfunctioning; thus the man does not know if his seed will be destroyed or a child will be born of it. When I will mention the reason for the impurity of the dead,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">I have not been able to find a clear reference to this. But see Ramban.

I will also mention certain main principles when discussing the law of the menstruant.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">See further, 18:19 (towards end).</i><br>Now Scripture was lenient in the case of a woman having an issue in her regular period, by not requiring her to bring an offering [as the <i>zavah</i>, the woman who sees blood outside her regular period, must do],<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verses 29-30.</i> because it is natural for her [to see blood at her period], and she is not healed of any sickness; rather, it declared her impure for seven days whether she saw [blood] for only one day or on all seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Note 32 in <i>Seder Tazria</i>.</i> However, women do not by nature experience [the menstrual flow] for more than seven days, except when they have an extra flow on account of sickness. Thus when <i>a woman has an issue of her blood many days out of the time</i><sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 25. The number of days is at least three.</i> known to her, or if she adds to the time of those seven [menstrual] days, and has an issue of her blood for many more days, it is a form of sickness comparable to the flux of a man, and Scripture required her to bring an offering<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verses 29-30.</i> when she is healed, just as the <i>zav</i> has to bring.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verses 14-15.</i><br>Now Scripture has not mentioned immersion in the case of the woman.

The reason [for their being lenient in the case of the impurity of a <i>zavah</i>] is because it was not necessary for Scripture to mention at all the expression, <i>and after that she shall be clean</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 28.</i> since the woman is included in the law of the man, and the verses were only necessary to mention the difference between a <i>zav</i> and <i>zavah</i>, that her flux must be of blood [and not white], and to distinguish between a flux in her regular period and outside the regular period. Therefore the Rabbis were of the opinion that [in the above phrase, <i>and after that she shall be clean</i>] Scripture intended to include an additional form of purification for her, saying, <i>and after that she shall be clean</i> like all those mentioned in the Torah, who are purified even without running water.<br>Acharei Moth

Chapter 16



Verse 1

AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES, AFTER THE DEATH OF THE TWO SONS OF AARON. The meaning of the phrase <i>after the death of the two sons of Aaron</i>, is that immediately after the death of his sons He had warned Aaron against [drinking] wine or strong drink [when going into the Tent of Meeting], so that he should not die,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 10:9.</i> and now He told Moses in addition to warn him so that he should not die when he draws near the Eternal [even in a sober condition, but at a time when he is not commanded to do so].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intent is thus to explain that we should not think that this section was made known to Moses immediately after the death of Aaron’s two sons, since the prohibition conveyed to Aaron against the ministering priests’ drinking wine, preceded it. The reason why Ramban finds this important to emphasize will be made clear further on. See Note 5.</i> It is likely that these two commandments were both conveyed on the day after the death of Aaron’s sons, for on the actual day [when the deaths occurred, Aaron] was a mourner, and the holy spirit does not rest upon man in moments of sadness,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi Succah V, 1. And therefore G-d would not have communicated with Aaron on that day.</i> and the communication concerning the prohibition against wine came to Aaron,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 10:8. Thus it must have been on the day after the day of the tragedy, when he was no longer a mourner.</i> and in that selfsame day this commandment [stated in the section before us] was also told to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">We may now understand why Ramban emphasized that the phrase <i>after the death of the two sons of Aaron</i> does not mean immediately after their death, since it was preceded by G-d’s command to Aaron. For had the phrase meant “immediately following their death,” then it would have been possible that this command came to Moses on the day of the death of Aaron’s sons. But now that the Divine command to Aaron preceded it, and that could not have taken place on the day of the tragedy [for the reason explained in the text], but only on the following day, it follows that the Divine command given to Moses, as contained in this section, was also communicated to him on the day after the death of Aaron’s sons. Ramban’s stressing of this is obviously intended to take exception to what Chizkuni clearly writes in his commentary, that it was on the selfsame day that the death occurred that the command contained in this section was communicated. On this Ramban commented: “The holy spirit does not rest upon man in moments of sadness.”</i> Scripture, however, preceded the prohibitions with which He warned Israel <i>that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile My Tabernacle that is in the midst of them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 15:31. “And incidentally He explained already all the laws of impurity” (Tur).</i> [before dealing with the commands specific to Aaron], and only afterwards He wrote the warning [applying to] the individual [i.e., this section, which was to be conveyed by Moses to Aaron, as the verse states: <i>And the Eternal said unto Moses:</i> ‘<i>Speak unto Aaron thy brother</i> etc.’].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 2.</i> But in my opinion the whole Torah is written in consecutive order, and in all places where He changed the order, placing an earlier event in a later position, Scripture clearly states so, such as the verses: <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses in Mount Sinai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 25:1.</i> [later on] in this book, [the laws of which were declared to Moses in the Tent of Meeting]; <i>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 7:1.</i> in the following book [i.e., the Book of Numbers], and similar such statements. Therefore Scripture stated here <i>after the death</i>, in order to inform us that this [communication] was [given to Moses] immediately after the death of the two sons of Aaron [and according to the historical sequence of events, it should have been placed in Chapter 10 above, where the account of events following their death is given].<br>And in the opinion of our Rabbis who said<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, beginning of <i>Acharei Moth</i>, 3. Quoted also in Rashi.</i> [by way of a parable, that this verse can be compared to the case of a physician who warned his patient not to eat cold things or sleep in a damp place, and another physician warned him likewise but added]: “so that you should not die as that person died;” thus “this [second physician] put him on his guard more than the first one,” [according to this comment of the Rabbis] the meaning of the verse will be, that G-d said to Moses these words: “<i>After the death of the two sons of Aaron</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the expression <i>after the death</i> is not a chronological note marking the occasion when this communication was given, but constitutes part of the Divine words, as if to say: “Now that the death of Aaron’s sons happened because they drew near etc., therefore speak to Aaron etc.”</i> <i>when they drew near before the Eternal</i>, speak to him <i>that he come not at all times into the holy place … that he die not</i>.”

Verse 2

SPEAK UNTO AARON THY BROTHER. The meaning of the epithet <i>thy brother</i> is that “you are to warn him because he is your brother, for even though you are not under this prohibition against coming [into the holy place at all times, thus you might think that Aaron, too, is not subject to this restriction, since he is your brother, nonetheless] Aaron, your brother, <i>is</i> under the prohibition against coming [into the holy place at all times].”<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that this Scriptural section indicates that Aaron’s sons [died because they] brought the fire of incense into the innermost part of the Sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Holy of Holies. This explains, according to Ibn Ezra, why He mentioned here the death of Aaron’s sons, and then followed it up with the admonition against the priests entering at all times <i>into the holy place within the Veil</i> (M’kor Chayim).</i> But in my opinion this is not correct. For the verses which mention their sin always say, <i>when they offered ‘strange’ fire before the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 3:4. <i>Ibid.</i>, 26:61.</i> And if [you accept as] proof that they entered into the innermost part of the Sanctuary, the prohibition with which G-d warned Moses concerning their father [i.e., Aaron], so that he die not [as Ibn Ezra said], then [you should] certainly accept as proof [that they died because] they entered the Sanctuary whilst intoxicated by wine, the prohibition that was said to Aaron himself immediately after their death, [<i>Drink no wine nor strong drink</i> etc.]!<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 10:9.</i> Moreover, how could it have occurred to them to enter on that day the [innermost] part [of the Sanctuary] which [even] their father did not enter, for Aaron burnt the incense on the “inner” altar [which stood in the Sanctuary proper], and why should they bring in their incense to a place further inside [the Sanctuary] than their father! Now I have already hinted at the nature of their sin,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 10:2.</i> and the language of the verses point thereto. But the expression <i>‘b’korvatham’</i> (when they approached) [does not mean, as Ibn Ezra interpreted it, “<i>when they approached</i> by entering the innermost part of the holy place”, but] according to its plain meaning is like the expression <i>‘uv’korvatham’</i> (<i>and when they come near</i>) <i>to the altar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:32.</i> <i>to minister</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Or when they come near to the altar to minister</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 30:20).</i> Thus the verse here is stating that Aaron’s sons died when they ministered before G-d. If so, [the sense of the warning here] is that He warned Aaron that he should only minister in the place which He commands [that it be done], and at the time He specifies for it.<br>It is possible that the sense of the verse is similar to that which our Rabbis have said,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Mechilta, <i>Beshalach Vayasa</i> 6. See also Rashi, Numbers 17:13.</i> that the people were speaking perversely of the incense, saying, “Through it Nadab and Abihu [Aaron’s sons] died etc.” Therefore Scripture stated that <i>after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the Eternal</i> with the incense, He said to Aaron that he should come even nearer before the Eternal than they did, and <i>with</i> incense, for if he comes into the holy place [i.e., the Holy of Holies] <i>without</i> the incense, he will die, for with it he shall enter there first, just as He said, <i>and he shall bring it within the Veil … and the cloud of the incense will cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verses 12-13. According to tradition the High Priest first entered the Holy of Holies, and then put the incense upon the censer containing the coals of fire from the altar that stood in the outside Court. This Service, as will be explained further on, was done only on the Day of Atonement.</i> This then is the meaning of the phrase [here in Verse 2 before us], <i>for I will appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover</i>, meaning that he [Aaron now, and the High Priest in succeeding generations] is only to enter there with the incense whose cloud rises up there [upon the ark-cover], even as He said, <i>and the cloud of the incense will cover the ark-cover</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13. Thus it will be shown that it is not the incense which brings death, for here Aaron went into the Sanctuary even further than his sons did, and he was protected by the incense. People will thus conclude that it is sin that brings death, and not the incense. This is clearly the trend of Ramban’s thought.</i>
THAT HE COME NOT AT ALL TIMES INTO THE HOLY PLACE WITHIN THE VEIL. The meaning of the expression <i>at all times</i> is that since He had already mentioned the Day of Atonement, saying, <i>And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it</i> [i.e., the golden altar which stood within the Sanctuary] <i>once in the year</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:10.</i> therefore He stated here that Aaron is not to come at any time <i>into the holy place</i> [<i>within the Veil</i>], except <i>with this</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3 here.</i> [procedure], that is to say, on the day that he brings these offerings to effect atonement. Later on in this section He explains with what Aaron shall enter, just as He said, <i>and he shall bring it within the Veil</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12.</i> and then He specifies the day, that it be <i>in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 29.</i> and then He states again that it be [only] <i>once in the year</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 34.</i>

Verse 3

The secret of <i>‘b’zoth’</i> (<i>With this</i>) <i>shall Aaron come into the holy place</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3 here.</i> is analogous to the secret of <i>‘zoth’</i> (<i>this is</i>) <i>the token of the covenant which I have established</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 9:17.</i> I have already explained it.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">“And you will find it in the covenant of the Sabbath” (Ma’or V’shamesh).

He came in there by merit of [their studying] Torah, as it is said, <i>and ‘this’ is the law;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:44.</i> by merit of circumcision, as it is said, <i>‘This’ is My covenant, which ye shall keep;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 17:10.</i> by merit of keeping the Sabbath, as it is said, <i>Happy is the man that doeth ‘this’</i> [<i>… that keepeth the Sabbath</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 56:2.</i> by the guarding influence of Jerusalem, as it is said, <i>‘This’ is Jerusalem;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 5:5.</i> by the guarding influence of the [twelve] tribes, as it is said, <i>and ‘this’ is that their father spoke unto them;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 49:28.</i> by the guarding influence of Judah, as it is said, <i>And ‘this’</i> [Moses said] <i>for Judah;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 33:7.</i> by the guarding influence of the congregation of Israel, as it is said, <i>‘This’ thy stature is like to a palm-tree;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 7:8.</i> by merit of [Israel having observed the law of] the heave-offering, as it is said, <i>And ‘this’ is ‘ha’terumah’</i> (<i>the offering</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 25:3. The word <i>terumah</i> is here understood in the wider sense of “something set apart.” The portion given to the priest from the produce of the corn, etc. is therefore <i>terumah</i>.

Verse 4

HE SHALL PUT ON THE LINEN TUNIC OF ‘KODESH’ (HOLINESS). “This means that they [i.e., all the garments of the High Priest] must be of the Sanctuary [treasury, and not of his own possession].” This is Rashi’s language.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi thus interprets the verse to mean: “he shall put on the linen tunic of the Sanctuary.” Ramban will later suggest that by way of the simple meaning of Scripture, the phrase means that “he shall put on ‘the holy’ linen tunic.” It is so rendered in the J.P.S. translation.</i> Thus the following phrase which states, <i>they are garments of ‘kodesh’</i> (<i>holiness</i>) must therefore mean that all the garments [even those of the ordinary priests], must come from the Sanctuary [treasury]. And [so] it is stated in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 1:10.</i> “<i>‘Kodesh yilbash’</i> (‘He shall put on’ the linen tunic ‘of holiness’), this means that these [garments of the High Priest] are to be of the Sanctuary. From this phrase I would only know concerning these garments [i.e., the four garments worn by the High Priest when he ministered in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement]. Whence do I know to include the other garments of the High Priest [i.e., the eight golden garments in which he officiated throughout the year], and the garments of his brethren the priests [that they too must all come from the Temple treasury]? Scripture therefore says, <i>they are garments of ‘kodesh’</i> (<i>holiness</i>). It is a conclusion by analogy that all garments [worn by all priests] should be of the Temple treasury” [since they all come under the term <i>‘garments of holiness’</i>].<br>By way of the simple meaning of Scripture, just as He said, <i>and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:4.</i> referring to the eight [golden] garments, He states that these [four garments worn by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement] are also holy garments. Their secret is analogous to <i>the man clothed in linen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 9:11. The symbol there is that G-d will not destroy His people, but that He will deal with them in mercy (Abusaula).</i> and therefore He informed him that <i>they are holy garments</i>. And in Vayikra Rabbah the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 21:10.</i> “As the Service performed Above, so is the Service below. Just as of the Service Above it is said, <i>one man in the midst of them clothed in linen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 9:2.</i> so of the Service below it is said, <i>he shall put on the holy linen tunic</i>.
HE SHALL PUT ON … HE SHALL BE GIRDED … HE SHALL BE ATTIRED.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The verse reads: <i>‘He shall put on’ the holy linen tunic, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and ‘he shall be girded’ with the linen belt, and with the linen mitre ‘he shall be attired.’</i> The use of the multiple verbs will be explained in the following text from the Torath Kohanim.</i> [The Scriptural use of these multiple expressions is] explained by the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 1:14.</i> “Since we are finally bound to include [among the requirements for the Service on the Day of Atonement] another set of [four linen] garments [when he brought out the spoon and censer from the Holy of Holies] in the afternoon of that day, then I might think that if he has no other set of garments he should not put on those he wore in the morning [when he first entered the Holy of Holies]. Scripture therefore says <i>he shall put on … he shall be girded … he shall be attired</i>” [thus indicating by the multiple use of these expressions that the High Priest may wear these vestments again in the afternoon].<br>Now Rashi commented: “<i>‘Yitznoph’</i> (<i>he shall be attired</i>). [The word is to be understood as the Targum rendered it:] <i>yocheith b’reishei</i> which means “he shall ‘place’ it upon his head.” This is like <i>‘vatanach’ his garment by her</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 39:16.</i> which the Targum rendered ‘<i>v’achthethei</i>,” meaning “and she ‘placed’ [his garment by her].” But Onkelos’ opinion [in translating the Hebrew word <i>yitznoph</i> as “placing”] is not clear to me, for the term <i>tzniphah</i> means “winding” [something] around the head like a turban,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban, Exodus 28:31. (Vol. II, pp. 486-7).</i> so why did he translate it merely as “placing,” and did not render it by an [Aramaic] word which is used specifically for actual “winding”? Perhaps there is no equivalent expression for it in the Aramaic language, for even the expression in [the Book of] Isaiah, <i>‘hatzniphoth’ and the mantles</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 3:23. <i>Tzniphoth</i> is translated “turbans.”</i> Yonathan ben Uziel rendered <i>kitoraya</i> (“crownings” surrounding the head). Thus both [Onkelos and Yonathan] had no Aramaic equivalent for <i>tzniph</i> [in the Book of Isaiah] <i>and mitznepheth</i> [in the Torah — Exodus 28:4], and therefore both of them used the same term derived from the Sacred Language — <i>mitznephta</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the Hebrew <i>mitznepheth</i> [in Exodus 28:4] is rendered both by Onkelos and Yonathan as <i>mitznephta</i>, which is basically the same Hebrew word as <i>mitznepheth</i>, since they had no Aramaic word for it.</i>

For the goat which was sent away was not an “offering’<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “it was unlike all other offerings” (Ohel Yoseph).</i> since it was not slaughtered. Now if you can understand the secret of the word after ‘Azazel,’<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 10 it states <i>‘la’azazel hamidbarah’</i> (<i>for Azazel into the wilderness</i>).

Here then is the secret of why the goat that was sent away to Azazel was not slaughtered, so that it should not appear as a form of sacrifice to the satyrs (Ohel Yoseph).

Now of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra it may be said that <i>he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 11:13.</i> and I will not be <i>the talebearer who revealeth</i> his secret,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The above verse reads: <i>He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter</i>. Ramban thus after paying tribute to Ibn Ezra for remaining faithful to the spirit of the second half of the verse, now says that nor will he himself be in violation of the first half of the verse, since the Sages have already revealed that secret in many places.</i> since our Rabbis of blessed memory have already revealed it in many places. Thus they have said in Bereshith Rabbah:<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshith Rabbah 65:10.</i> “<i>And the ‘sa’ir’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “the goat.” But this Hebrew term <i>sa’ir</i> was also used by Scripture with reference to Esau [as the text continues], in the sense of “hairy.”</i> <i>shall carry upon him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> this is a reference to Esau, as it is said, <i>Behold, Esau my brother is a man who is ‘sa’ir’</i> (<i>hairy</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 27:11.</i> <i>All ‘avonotham’</i> (<i>their iniquities</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> [read]: <i>‘avonoth tam’</i> (the sins of him who has been called <i>tam</i>, ‘a man of integrity’), as it is said, <i>and Jacob was a man ‘tam’</i> (‘of integrity’).”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 25:27.</i> It is explained more clearly in the Chapters of the great Rabbi Eliezer:<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 46.</i> “The reason why<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">This is in connection with what is told in the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, that “on the day the Torah was given to Israel, Satan said before the Holy One, blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, you have given me control over all the wicked, but over the righteous You have not given me control!’ To this the Holy One, blessed be He, replied: ‘You will have control over them on the Day of Atonement if they have sinned, and if not, you will have no control over them.’” Therefore etc.</i> they would give Sammael [i.e., Satan] a conciliatory gift on the Day of Atonement, was so that he should not annul [the effect of] their offerings, as it is said, <i>one lot for the Eternal, and the other lot for Azazel</i>, the lot of the Holy One, blessed by He, to be a burnt-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">In view of the fact that the goat for the Eternal was offered as a sin-offering [as stated in Verse 9]. Rabbi David Luria in his commentary to the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, emends the text to read: “the lot of the Holy One, blessed be He, to be <i>a sin-offering</i>.” It would seem, however, that Ramban calls it a “burnt-offering” because although it was technically <i>a sin-offering</i>, it was completely burnt as is a burnt-offering (further, Verse 27) and not eaten as is a sin-offering.</i> and the lot of Azazel to be ‘the goat of sin,’ bearing upon it all the iniquities of Israel, as it is said, <i>And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> When Sammael saw that he could find no sin on the Day of Atonement amongst them [the children of Israel], he said to the Holy One, blessed by He: ‘Master of all worlds! You have one people on earth who are comparable to the ministering angels in the heavens. Just as the ministering angels are barefooted, so are the Israelites barefooted [i.e., do not wear leather shoes] on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels do not eat or drink, so is there no eating or drinking in Israel on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels have no joints [in their feet, and therefore cannot sit or lie down], so do the Israelites stand on their feet on the Day of Atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This would seem to be a reference to the Sanctuary, where the Service on the Day of Atonement lasted continuously for almost the whole day, and since it was not permitted to sit in the Sanctuary Court, the people who were there had to stand on their feet the whole day (Rabbi David Luria). Based on this text the custom has spread among devout Jews to stand on their feet during the whole Day of Atonement (see Shulchan Aruch, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 619:5).</i> Just as there is peace in the midst of the ministering angels, so do the Israelites bring peace among themselves on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels are free from all sin, so are the Israelites free from all sin on the Day of Atonement.’ And the Holy One, blessed be He, hears the testimony concerning Israel from their prosecutor, and He atones for the altar and for the Sanctuary, <i>and for the priests and for all the people of the assembly</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 33.</i> as it is said, <i>And he shall make atonement for the most holy place</i> etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 33.</i> Thus far is the language of this Agadah (tradition) in which the Rabbis have informed us of his name [i.e., Sammael] and the nature of his deeds.<br>Now this is the secret of the matter. They used to worship “other gods,” namely, the angels, bringing offerings of a sweet savor to them, similarly to that which it says, <i>and thou didst set Mine oil and My incense before them. My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor, and thus it was; saith the Eternal G-d</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 16:18-19.</i> You have to contemplate the Scriptural text as it is written and [also] as [it is read according to the] Masoretic tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Masorah we read in the above first verse: <i>nathat</i> (<i>‘thou’ didst set Mine oil</i> …), but the Hebrew word is actually written with a letter <i>yod</i> at the end, which suggests the reading <i>nathati</i>, meaning: “and ‘I’ did set Mine oil and Mine incense before them for your sake; that is to say, the offering which you brought before Me, it is I who gave it to them,” (Abusuala), as will be explained further on in the text. The same applies to the following verse where the Hebrew word is read <i>unethatha</i> (<i>‘thou’ didst even set it</i>), but it is actually written with a letter <i>yod: unethati</i>, meaning, “and I did set it …” (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> Now the Torah has absolutely forbidden to accept them as deities, or to worship them in any manner. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us that on the Day of Atonement we should let loose a goat in the wilderness, to that “prince” [power] which rules over wastelands, and this [goat] is fitting for it because he is its master, and destruction and waste emanate from that power, which in turn is the cause of the stars of the sword, wars, quarrels, wounds, plagues, division and destruction. In short, it is the spirit of the sphere of Mars, and its portion among the nations is Esau [Rome], the people that inherited the sword and the wars, and among animals [its portion consists of] the <i>se’irim</i> (demons) and the goats. Also in its portion are the devils called “destroyers” in the language of our Rabbis, and in the language of Scripture: <i>se’irim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 17:7.</i> (satyrs, demons), for thus he [i.e., Esau] and his nation were called <i>sa’ir</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 27:11. Numbers 24:18.</i> Now the intention in our sending away the goat to the desert was not that it should be an offering from us to it — Heaven forbid! Rather, our intention should be to fulfill the wish of our Creator, Who commanded us to do so. This may be compared to the case of someone who makes a feast for his master, and the master commands the person making the feast, “Give one portion to that servant of mine,” in which case the host gives nothing [of his own] to that servant, and it is not to show him honor that he acts in that way to him, but everything is given to the master and it is the master that gives a gift to his servant; the host only observes his command and does in honor of the master whatever he commanded him to do. The master, however, out of his own compassion for the host, wanted all his servants to derive some enjoyment from it [the feast], in order that they may all speak of his [the host’s] praise and not of his shortcomings.<br>This then is the reason [for having someone] who casts the lots [on the two goats]. If the priest were to dedicate them merely, by word of mouth [without casting the lots], saying, “one for the Eternal” and “one for Azazel,” that would be like worshipping [Azazel] or taking a vow in its name.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 60 b: “He who makes a vow in the name of an idol, transgresses a negative commandment,” i.e., <i>and make no mention of the name of other gods</i> (Exodus 23:13, Rashi). Ramban’s thought is thus clear. If the priest were to dedicate the two goats by word of mouth, without the casting of lots, that would be as if he was worshipping Azazel, a deed which is punishable by death, and in addition it would be making a vow in the name of an idol, which is also prohibited under penalty of whipping. In either case, then, he would be doing something which the Torah has prohibited.</i> Rather, the priest <i>set</i> the two goats <i>before the Eternal at the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> for both of them were a gift to G-d, and he gave to His servant that portion which came to him from G-d. It is he [i.e., the priest] who cast the lots on them, but it is His hand that apportioned them, something like that which it says, <i>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing of it is of the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 16:33.</i> Even after the casting of the lots, the priest placed the two goats <i>before the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10.</i> thus proclaiming that both are His and that by sending one away [to the desert] we intend merely to fulfill G-d’s wish, just as it said, <i>And the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive ‘before the Eternal,’ to make atonement over him, to send him away</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10.</i> That is the reason why we do not ourselves do any act of slaughtering [of that goat, as this would imply that it is a proper offering which requires slaughtering]. And Onkelos rendered the expression (<i>one lot for the Eternal, and one lot for Azazel</i>) as: “one lot for ‘the Name of’ the Eternal and one lot for Azazel;” [thus he was careful not to translate “and one lot <i>for the name of</i> Azazel”], because the one was “for the Name of the Eternal” and not for him [Azazel], and the second was “for Azazel” but not “for the name of Azazel.”<br>It is for this reason that our Rabbis have interpreted:<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 13:10. See also Yoma 67 b.</i> “<i>And My statutes shall ye keep</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 18:4.</i> These are matters against which the evil inclination raises accusations, and the idolaters likewise bring charges, such as the [prohibition against] wearing clothes made of a mixture of wool and linen, [the law of] the Red Heifer, and of the goat that is sent away [to Azazel].” Now these idolaters have not accused us [according to our Rabbis] in connection with the offerings, for these are <i>the fire-offerings unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 4:35; 5:12.</i> But they accuse us in connection with the goat that is sent away [to Azazel], because they think that we act as they do. Similarly they accuse us in connection with the Red Heifer, because it is slaughtered <i>without the camp</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Number 19:3.</i> but [in truth] the purport thereof is analogous to that of the goat sent away [to Azazel], which is to remove the spirit of impurity, as it is said of the future, <i>And also I will cause the</i> [false] <i>prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the Land</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Zechariah 13:2. That the reference is to the “false” prophets is clearly stated in Yonathan ben Uziel’s rendition of the verse.</i> On this basis you will understand the reason why the person who sent forth the goat to Azazel must wash his garments [as they were rendered impure],<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 26.</i> and likewise he who burns the Red Heifer,<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 19:8.</i> and what our Rabbis have mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 83 a.

Numbers 15:24. See also Ramban above, 4:2 (towards end: “He did not mention here etc.”)</i> Thus Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra intimated to you that you will know the secret of [sending away the goat to Azazel] when you reach the verse, <i>And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 17:7.

It is the place to which “the goat goes.” So clearly explained by Rabbeinu Bachya (in my edition, II p. 499), and so found also in R’dak’s Sefer Hashorashim under root <i>eiz</i>.</i> There are many such cases.

See Vol. I, p. 59, Note 237, for fuller discussion of this term.

I cannot explain more, for I would have to close the mouths of those who claim to be wise in the study of nature, following after that Greek [philosopher Aristotle] who denied everything except that which could be perceived by him [through the physical senses], and he, and his wicked disciples, were so proud as to suspect<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">“Suspect.” In some books: “think.”</i> that whatever he could not conceive of through his reasoning is not true!<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The attitude of these philosophers, who claimed that whatever their minds could not understand was untrue, was especially obnoxious to Ramban. History has fully borne him out on this matter, for there are literally myriads of matters which the Medieval scholastics, conditioned as they were by Aristotelian concepts of the universe, considered impossible, and are now proven facts. And who can foretell the future of our present-day concepts of the universe? There are obviously facts which lie beyond the present-day grasp of the human mind, which will some day become firmly established. To deny their possibility just because we do not understand them, was to Ramban a manifestation of arrogance.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

AND HE SHALL PUT THEM UPON THE HEAD OF THE GOAT. Such an expression is not used with reference to the bullock of Aaron [over which he confessed his own sins and those of the other priests], nor in relation to the goat of the sin-offering of the Eternal, nor regarding the leaning of hands upon any of the offerings. This is because all offerings were brought for acceptance <i>upon the fires of G-d</i><sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 4:35; 5:12.</i> [which burnt on the altar], and thus they effected pardon and atonement. But this [goat that was sent away to Azazel], since it was not for G-d, and the recipient thereof [i.e. Sammael] has no power to offer atonement or pardon, therefore the goat merely carries the people’s sins away, and [the accusing angel] must answer “Amen” against his will.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, Verse 8 [in connection with the quote from the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer about Sammael]. The particular expression of Ramban here is based upon a Rabbinic tradition (Shabbath 119 b) that two ministering angels, one good and one bad, accompany a person on the eve of the Sabbath on his way from the synagogue to his home. If the house is in order, the light is kindled, and peace reigns throughout, the good angel says, “May it be so on the next Sabbath as well,” and the bad angel answers “Amen” against his will, etc.</i> When the Israelites are free from all sins and transgressions [as after the moment of confession of sins over the goat sent to Azazel], he indeed carries their sins away, as is mentioned in many verses in the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., <i>thou shalt set the blessing upon Mount Gerizim, and the curse upon Mount Ebal</i> (Deuteronomy 11:29).</i> and the prophets. This then is [the meaning of the expression], <i>and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> That was the reason why the thread of crimson wool<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">A thread of crimson wool was tied on the head of the goat as soon as the lot determined that it was to be sent to Azazel (Yoma 41 b). When the person who brought it there finally arrived at the ravine, he divided the threat and tied one half to the rock and the other half between the horns of the goat (<i>ibid.</i>, 67a). There was also a thread of crimson wool tied to the door of the Sanctuary (<i>ibid.</i>, 68 b). At the moment of the fulfillment of the Divine command concerning this goat, the threads miraculously turned white as a sign of the Divine forgiveness, as it is said, <i>though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow</i> (Isaiah 1:18) (Yoma 68 b).</i> turned white at the time when the goat was sent away to Azazel, i.e., at the moment that he pushed it over the cliff, when it was broken in pieces, as is mentioned in the words of the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 67 a.</i>

Verse 22



Verse 23

AND AARON SHALL COME INTO THE TENT OF MEETING. “Our Rabbis have said that this is not the proper place of this verse [which ought rather to follow Verse 25], and they explained the reason for their saying so in Tractate Yoma,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32 a.</i> stating: The whole section is written according to the procedure [which was actually followed in the Service on the Day of Atonement], except for this ‘coming’ [of the High Priest into the Holy of Holies] which was actually done after he offered his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people [stated in Verse 24], and after the burning of the fats of the bullock [of Aaron] and the goat [of the sin-offering of the people], which rites were performed outside the Sanctuary [proper, as stated in Verse 25, i.e., in the Sanctuary Court, and therefore done by the High Priest dressed] in golden garments. [It was only after he had done these things that] he immersed himself [in a ritual pool] and washed his hands and feet and took them [the golden garments] off,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">So I have found in all editions of Rashi, including the first Reggio (1475) edition. But obviously the procedure was that he first removed the garments, and then immersed himself. The washing of hands and feet according to the Sages also took place before the removal of the garments (Yoma 31 b).</i> and put on the linen garments, and then he came into the Tent of Meeting [as mentioned in our verse] to take out [from the Holy of Holies] the spoon and the censer in which he had burnt the incense in the innermost part of the Sanctuary. <i>And then he shall put off the linen garments</i> after he had taken them [the spoon and the censer] out, and attires himself in his golden clothes for the Daily burnt-offering brought in the afternoon.”<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:4.</i> All this is Rashi’s language.<br>Now this is truly a case where the verse calls aloud for elucidation. For it is not at all conceivable that [the verse] should command that Aaron come into the Tent of Meeting for no purpose whatsoever other than that of taking off his garments<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">The verse as stated reads: <i>And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall put off the linen garments … and shall leave them there</i>. Under no circumstances, as Ramban points out, can this be taken literally. It must then mean etc.</i> and being naked in G-d’s temple, and that he should leave the garments there to decay! Rather, we must perforce interpret the verse thus: <i>And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</i> to do some act of the Service which Scripture found it unnecessary to mention, that is, the removal of the spoon and the censer [which he had left in the Holy of Holies when he had burnt the incense there]. The explanation of the [order of the] verses is thus as follows. Having mentioned at first, <i>And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Eternal, that the cloud of the incense may cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> meaning to say that he is to place the incense upon the fire until the cloud of the incense goes up, and then he is to go out immediately, leaving there the spoon [in which he had carried the incense] and the censer [which contained the coals of fire, and upon which the incense was now burning], and which he would in any case have to remove later on from there, Scripture therefore says, <i>and Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</i> in order to enter within the Veil [and to bring out] the things he had left there. Now the Scriptural section here did not mention all that the priest did at the beginning when [attired] in the golden garments, such as the [offering of the] Daily burnt-offering of the morning,<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:4.</i> but rather it began with the [special] Service performed on the Day of Atonement, which was done in the white [linen] garments, and it arranged the following procedure [of things to be done in these garments]: burning of incense within the Holy of Holies, the [rites of the] bullock [of Aaron] and of the goat [whose blood was sprinkled] within [the Holy of Holies], and the matter of the goat that was sent away to Azazel. All these rites were done in one order, and there was nothing left to be performed in these [white linen] garments except for the bringing out of the spoon and the censer [from the Holy of Holies]. Now it is always the custom of Scripture to finish a subject which it began, although there may be some matters which took place after that which it mentions later [as here, where the removal of the spoon and censer took place after the events of Verses 24-28, but is referred to before, in Verse 23, to finish the subject of the events done in the white garments]. Therefore Scripture states, <i>and Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting</i> in these [white linen] garments, to complete his Service, namely, the bringing out of the spoon and the censer which he has to remove from there, and after he came out from there <i>he shall put off</i> his garments <i>which he put on</i> in the morning at the time <i>when he went into the holy place, and he shall leave them there</i> where he took them off, thus teaching us that he is not to use them again on a subsequent Day of Atonement. Therefore Scripture completed in one sequence everything that was to be done during the whole day in the white garments. [Thus Scripture mentions the removal of the spoon and censer here in Verse 23, although it actually took place only later after the events mentioned in Verses 24-28, in order to complete in one sequence all the events done in the white garments]. Then it went back and said, <i>and he shall bathe his flesh in water … and put on his other vestments</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> i.e., those garments which are known to him from his ministry during the whole year, thus teaching that [whenever he changes on that day] from one set of garments to another, he had to immerse himself [in a ritual pool]. Then Scripture states, <i>and ‘he shall come forth,’ and offer his burnt-offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> for everything that had been done hitherto in the white garments is considered “the Service within [the Sanctuary],” while his ram<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 3.</i> and the ram of the people<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> [which are the burnt-offerings] that He mentions [here in Verse 24: <i>and he shall come forth, and offer his burnt-offering of the people</i>], were done on the outer altar. Thus the section mentioned the High Priest’s first attirement in the white garments, and required him to immerse himself [first in a ritual pool],<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4: <i>and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on</i>.</i> and then it mentioned the final removal of these garments [after taking out the spoon and censer from the Holy of Holies], and required him to immerse himself [before he puts on the golden garments for the performance of the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon]. Thus we learn that he had to immerse himself [in a ritual pool] whenever there was a change of the garments.<br>Now in the opinion of Rashi this immersion of the High Priest for the bringing out of the spoon and the censer, took place after he had offered his ram and the ram of the people; [that is to say], between the Additional Offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">These are specified in Numbers 29:8, among the Additional Offerings for all the festivals.</i> and the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon. This is also the opinion of all the Gaonim,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Ki Thisa</i>, Vol. II, p. 521, Note 74.</i> and it would likewise so appear from the plain meaning of a Beraitha<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Bo</i>, Vol. II, p. 133, Note 209.</i> taught in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 6:5. See in my Hebrew commentary p. 92.</i> But we have found in the Yerushalmi:<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi Yoma VII, 2. On the name “Yerushalmi,” see above in <i>Seder Metzora</i> Note 44.</i> “Rabbi Yochanan said, ‘All Sages agree that the taking out of the spoon and the censer [from the Holy of Holies] was done <i>after</i> [the slaughtering of] the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon.’” And so did Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] write.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Avodath Yom Hakippurim</i> 2:2.</i> So also is the procedure taught in our Mishnah [following the High Priest’s removal of the spoon and the censer]:<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 70 a.</i> “He washed his hands and feet, took off [his white garments], went down and immersed himself, and they brought him the golden garments … and he went into [the Sanctuary] to burn the [daily] incense of the afternoon.”<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the text indicates that the slaughtering of the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon had already taken place, for if not, the Mishnah would have stated: “and they brought him the golden garments … and he went out and offered the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon, and then he went into the Sanctuary to burn the incense etc.”</i> Rather, the order was as follows: The [special] Service of the Day of Atonement was performed in the white garments;<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Since this special Service followed that of the ordinary Daily burnt-offering of the morning, which was performed in the golden garments, and was also preceded by the priest immersing himself in a ritual pool, it followed that his attiring himself in the white garments to perform the special Service for the Day of Atonement was after his <i>second</i> immersion. This is important to note in order to understand the text which follows.</i> his [the High Priest’s] ram and the ram of the people, the Additional Offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">These are specified in Numbers 29:8, among the Additional Offerings for all the festivals.</i> the [burning of the] fats of the sin-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 25.</i> and [the slaughtering of] the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon were all done in the golden garments following the [High Priest’s] third immersion; the taking out of the spoon and censer [from the Holy of Holies] was done in the white garments following the fourth immersion, while the [daily] burning of the incense of [the afternoon], the [daily] offering of the High Priest’s cakes,<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 6:13-15.</i> the libations and [the kindling of] the lamps [in the candelabrum], were done in the golden garments following the fifth immersion.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Such was the law taught to Moses on Sinai, that “on this day [i.e., the Day of Atonement] the High Priest immerses himself <i>five</i> times and washes his hands and feet <i>ten</i> times” as he changes from one set of garments to another in the performance of the various rites of the day (Yoma 32 a, Rashi). Rashi’s statement here on the verse before us that “this is not its proper place” is thus to be understood as follows: Since Scripture wanted to complete in one section everything that was to be done in the white garments during the whole day, as is its custom everywhere to finish a subject that it began, although there may be some minor matters which are mentioned afterwards but really took place before the conclusion of that subject, it therefore purposely stated it here, although the actual performance thereof took place at a later point in the Service of the Day of Atonement, as is explained in the text.</i> The reason for this [delaying of the removal of the spoon and censer until after the slaughtering of the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon] is because it [the removal of the spoon and censer] is not in itself a rite of Service, therefore they delayed it until all the acts of the day were done, as long as the five [required] immersions<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Such was the law taught to Moses on Sinai, that “on this day [i.e., the Day of Atonement] the High Priest immerses himself <i>five</i> times and washes his hands and feet <i>ten</i> times” as he changes from one set of garments to another in the performance of the various rites of the day (Yoma 32 a, Rashi).

Therefore they interrupted the regular order of rites in the Daily burnt-offering of the afternoon, and [the High Priest] took out the spoon and censer [from the Holy of Holies] between the slaughtering of the burnt-offering and the burning of the incense.

AND THE BULLOCK OF THE SIN-OFFERING, AND THE GOAT OF THE SIN-OFFERING … HE SHALL CARRY FORTH WITHOUT THE CAMP. In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, <i>‘he’ shall carry forth</i> means Aaron, who has been mentioned in this section, [and he is to do it] by commanding others [to carry them forth without the camp]. The correct interpretation is that it means: <i>yotzi hamotzi</i> (“whoever shall carry them forth, shall carry them forth” without the camp).<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">The performer of the deed is thus implied in the verse, even though he is not specifically mentioned.</i> Similarly, the expression <i>and they shall burn</i> [in the verse before us] means, “and they that burn them, shall burn them.” Scripture states it in the plural, <i>and ‘they’ shall burn</i>, in order to teach us that if many people were engaged in the burning thereof — such as if one brought the fire, another arranged the wood of the pile, and another kindled the fire — only the garments of him who kindled the fire in the bullocks themselves<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Keseph Mezukak, the reading should be: “the bullock and the goats.” See further in my Hebrew commentary, p. 93.</i> are rendered impure, as soon as the fire takes hold of the greater part of it.

Verse 32

AND THE PRIEST WHO SHALL BE ANOINTED AND WHO SHALL BE CONSECRATED TO BE PRIEST IN HIS FATHER’S STEAD. “I might think that only [the High Priest] who has been anointed with the oil of anointment [may perform the Service on the Day of Atonement]. Whence do I know that a High Priest who is [inducted into office only] by many garments [i.e., the eight garments which distinguish him from all ordinary priests who wear only four garments, that he too may perform the Service on that day]? Scripture therefore says, <i>and who shall be consecrated</i>, by attiring the [eight] garments. Such were all the High Priests who functioned after the days of King Josiah [until the destruction of the Second Temple], for in his days the flask of anointing oil was hidden.”<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Josiah did this in order to prevent the desecration of the sacred oil by the hands of the enemy when Israel was to go into exile (Horayoth 12 a). The ark of the covenant was also hidden at that time (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> This is Rashi’s language. Now the Rabbi did not intend to say that it was only from the days of King Josiah that there were High Priests who were [inducted into office only by means of] many garments, for in the Gemara we find that the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Horayoth 13 a.</i> “Who has precedence over whom [in being redeemed from captivity, etc.], a High Priest anointed with the oil of anointment, or one who was [inducted into office only] by his attiring himself in the many garments?”<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">It is thus clear that both kinds of High Priest can exist simultaneously.</i> Again the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Makkoth 11 b.</i> “Does he [that killed a person unwittingly] return from the city of refuge [only] at the death of all of them [i.e., the High Priest anointed with the oil of anointment, and the one that was inducted into office only by his attiring himself in the many garments and one that had passed from his High-priesthood], or does he return at the death of one of them?”<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 35:25.</i> [Thus it is clear] that they can all be found at one time. Rather, [Rashi’s intent was that] if at any time [i.e., even when High Priests were still anointed with the oil of anointment], a priest was inducted [into the High-priesthood] by the many garments [worn by the High Priest], he was eligible to perform the Service of the Day of Atonement. For another priest was always prepared [in the High Priest’s stead] for the Day of Atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">“Lest aught befall the High Priest to render him ineligible” (Yoma 2 a).</i> and he was not anointed.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">See my Hebrew commentary p. 93 for various reasons.</i> Thus if some disqualification occurred to the High Priest [such as by becoming impure etc.], this priest served in his stead, as he was eligible to do so through his induction [to his position] by his attiring himself in the many garments, even if he was not anointed.

SPEAK UNTO AARON, AND UNTO HIS SONS, AND UNTO ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban is now to explain why this chapter [dealing with the prohibition of slaughtering any of the holy offerings outside the Sanctuary Court], is addressed to both the priests and all the children of Israel, which is an unusual form of address in the Scriptural laws.</i> Since this section contains the warning that all offerings are to be brought only in the Tent of Meeting [i.e., in the Sanctuary Court], He therefore admonishes the priests who perform the rites of the offerings that they are not to perform the rites outside [the Sanctuary Court], and He also admonishes the Israelites that they should bring them there to G-d, and not offer them outside by themselves.<br>The correct interpretation of this section is as our Rabbis have mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 16 b. This is the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.</i> that He forbade Israel whilst in the desert to eat an ordinary meal of meat<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “meat eaten out of desire to satisfy the appetite.”</i> [i.e., one which was not part of an offering], and they were to eat only the meat of peace-offerings [the fat portions and the blood of which] had been offered upon the altar of G-d. Therefore He said that whoever wants to slaughter any of the three kinds of animals from which all offerings are brought, namely, the ox, lamb, and goat, must bring them <i>unto the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>, and make them <i>offerings of peace-offerings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> bringing the fats and the blood upon the altar of G-d, and then he may eat the meat thereof according to the law [of peace-offerings, which is that the priest is given the breast and the right thigh, and the rest of the meat is eaten by the owner and his family for two days and the intervening night]. He further stated that if he slaughtered them in any other place, he is liable to the punishment of excision.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4: <i>and that man will be cut off from among his people</i>. See Ramban further, 18:29 for the specific meaning of this form of punishment.</i><br>It appears likely from the language of Scripture that at first [i.e., in Verse 3-7] He declared a person liable to the punishment of excision in the case of any slaughtering outside [the Sanctuary Court] even of unconsecrated animals, this being the prohibition against eating an ordinary meal of meat,<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “meat eaten out of desire to satisfy the appetite.”</i> and He stated that the reason for it is so that they should consecrate them to G-d <i>and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> and burn on it the fat. Afterwards [in Verses 8-9] He warned against making an altar to G-d outside [the Sanctuary Court] and offering on it the peace-offerings mentioned [in Verse 5] or a burnt-offering, as used to be done with holy offerings at the time when the <i>bamoth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">See above in <i>Seder Shemini</i>, Note 122 for full explanation of this term.</i> were permitted, but they were to offer them to G-d in front of <i>the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9.</i> Thus He ordered all slaughterings, whether of unconsecrated<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., originally brought as unconsecrated. When it is slaughtered in the Sanctuary Court as a peace-offering, it has naturally already become consecrated.</i> or consecrated animals, to be done only within [the Sanctuary Court]. Therefore He said in the Book of Deuteronomy, <i>But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the Land</i> etc., <i>then it shall come to pass that the place which the Eternal your G-d shall choose to cause His Name to dwell there, thither ye shall bring … your burnt-offerings, and your peace-offerings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:10-11.</i> stating further, <i>Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest; but in the place which the Eternal shall choose</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 13-14.</i> This was to state that the prohibition against slaughtering consecrated animals outside [the Sanctuary Court] remains in force as long as the Chosen House of G-d exists,<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Thus as long as the Tabernacle was at Shiloh, it was prohibited to bring offerings elsewhere. After its destruction by the Philistines, the <i>bamoth</i> were permitted. After the House of G-d was finally established in Jerusalem, the <i>bamoth</i> were again forbidden and never again permitted (Zebachim 112 b).</i> but He permitted slaughtering of ordinary [unconsecrated] animals [at all places]. It is this which He states, <i>However thou mayest slaughter and eat flesh in all thy gates</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:15.</i> meaning to say that this prohibition stated here — not to slaughter unconsecrated animals at all, but rather to bring them all as peace-offerings upon the altar of G-d — will not apply in the Land. And He explained there the reason: <i>When the Eternal thy G-d shall enlarge thy border</i> etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> meaning to say that the prohibition was only in the beginning when they were in the desert, so that it was easier for them to bring all their offerings to the door of the Tent of Meeting, but after He will enlarge their border [and they will inhabit a wide area], they may eat an ordinary meal of meat<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “meat eaten out of desire to satisfy the appetite.”</i> by slaughtering [the animal] in their city, except for consecrated animals [which they must slaughter only in the Sanctuary Court]. This is the reason why He mentions here [in Verse 3], <i>What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that slaughtereth … within the camp or that slaughtereth out of the camp</i>. Thus He mentions also those who slaughter <i>out of the camp</i>, so that they [too] should be obliged to bring them to the door of the Tent of Meeting; for although an ordinary meal of meat will be permissible when G-d will enlarge their borders, because they are not near the place of the Sanctuary, He does not likewise permit it in the desert, even outside the camp, because they are not far from the altar of G-d as they will be in the Land when G-d will enlarge their borders, at which time He permitted them an ordinary meal of meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “meat eaten out of desire to satisfy the appetite.”</i><br>This is the proper interpretation of these verses, and it corresponds to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 16 b. This is the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.</i> on these sections of the Torah. From this section here originates [what Rabbi Yishmael] said, that “at first [i.e., as long as Israel was in the desert] they were forbidden to have an ordinary meal of meat.” This is the fitting interpretation of the verse by way of the plain meaning of Scripture. It [also] coincides with the saying of the Rabbis in the Agadah:<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim Rabbah 4:6.</i> “The Rabbis say: There are many things which the Holy One, blessed be He, prohibited, and in another place permitted them again.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of course is obvious, that under a different set of circumstances He permitted those matters which He had prohibited elsewhere. The case before us is the perfect example, as the text continues.</i> You may know this [from the following instance]. The Holy One, blessed be He, forbade Israel to slaughter and eat an animal unless they brought it to the door of the Sanctuary [and slaughtered it as a peace-offering]. Whence do I know this? Because it is written, <i>and he hath not brought it into the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> What is written there? <i>Blood shall be imputed unto that man</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> And here [in the Book of Deuteronomy] He again permitted it to them, as it is said, <i>thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> Whence do I know [that this applies to the time after their entry into the Land]? From that which is stated there on this subject, <i>When the Eternal thy G-d shall enlarge thy border</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> As for that which Rashi has commented [here in Verse 3 on the expression, <i>what man soever there be that slaughtereth an ox, or lamb</i> etc.] that “Scripture is speaking of consecrated animals etc.” [while we have explained above that Verses 3-6 refer to ordinary animals, the answer is that Rashi here follows] the opinion of that Sage<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Akiba (Chullin 17 a).</i> who says that an ordinary meal of meat<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “meat eaten out of desire to satisfy the appetite.”</i> was never prohibited at all [even when Israel was in the desert]. It is in accordance with that opinion that the Beraitha was taught in the Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i>, Chapters 6, and 9-10.</i> but the explanation of the verses in a manner that accords with them, and the approach of the words of the Sages in the traditions,<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the text from Devarim Rabbah quoted above, which bears out fully Ramban’s explanation that when Israel was in the desert, an ordinary meal of meat was prohibited to them.</i> as well as in most places,<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban means to say that while it is true that the Torath Kohanim is like Rashi’s interpretation, yet most Rabbinic sources accept Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion, as presented by Ramban.</i> is as we have explained.

BLOOD SHALL BE IMPUTED UNTO THAT MAN. This means that [his guilt is as] of the time of Creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intention is as follows. At the time of Creation the slaughtering of any living creature as food was forbidden (see Ramban on Genesis 1:29, Vol. I, pp. 56-58). Only after the flood was the killing of animals permitted (<i>ibid.</i>, 9:5, pp. 134-135). Hence the meaning of the verse here is that if one slaughters an animal outside the camp, then since it is forbidden to him as food, it shall be imputed to him as if he is guilty of bloodshed “as at the time of Creation.” See also Ramban here on Verse 11.</i> The verse is thus stating: “Now of all living creatures except man, I [the Eternal] have declared their blood to be as water, <i>and their flesh as dung</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Zephaniah 1:17.</i> just as it is said [at the time of Noah], <i>as the green herb I have given you all</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 9:3.</i> But if one slaughters an animal outside the camp, then [since it is forbidden to be eaten], it shall be imputed to him as if he had shed blood [of a fellow man].”

AND THEY SHALL NO MORE SACRIFICE THEIR SACRIFICES ‘LA’SE’IRIM’ AFTER WHOM THEY GO ASTRAY. “<i>La’se’irim</i> means ‘unto the demons.’ Similarly it states, <i>‘u’se’irim’</i> (<i>and demons</i>) <i>shall dance there</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 13:21.</i> This is Rashi’s language, derived from the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 9:8.</i> Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that “the demons are so called [<i>se’irim</i>, a word which is connected with <i>sei’ar</i>, meaning ‘hair’], because on seeing them a person’s hair stands up on his body. But it is likely that they are called <i>se’irim</i> [a word which also means ‘goats’], because mentally deranged persons see them in the form of goats. And the word ‘more’ [in the verse before us, <i>and they shall no ‘more’ sacrifice</i> …] indicates that the Israelites used to do so in Egypt. <i>After whom they go astray</i> denotes that whoever seeks after them and believes in them ‘goes astray’ from his G-d, since he thinks that there is a power that can cause good or evil apart from the Glorious and Fearful Name.” [Thus far the words of Ibn Ezra.]<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has indeed hinted at the truth concerning the word “more,” as I have written above.<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 16:8 [beginning with the paragraph: “And this is the secret of the matter.

The body [of these creatures of two elements] is of a spiritual nature; on account of its delicacy and lightness it can fly through fire and air. And just as the combination of the four elements in any object is the cause of its existence and its destruction [since everything that is composite must ultimately revert to its original components],<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban on Genesis 2:17, Vol. I, p. 75.</i> so is it with these beings created from a combination of only two elements; when the elements combine, the creature lives, and when they separate [decompose], it is like the dead. It is for this reason that our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Chagigah 16 a.</i> “Six characteristics have been said of <i>sheidim</i>, in three they are comparable to the ministering angels and in three to human beings. The three things in which they are comparable to the ministering angels are that they have wings, they fly, and they know what is about to happen, as do the ministering angels. [On this statement the Gemara asked:] ‘How can it enter your mind to say that the <i>sheidim</i> know the future [when even the ministering angels do not know it]! Say rather thus: They hear [from behind <i>the Curtain of heaven</i>] what is about to happen.’ The three things in which they are comparable to human beings are that they eat and drink, procreate, and die as do human beings.”<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban now begins to explain the text quoted on the basis of certain scientific concepts that were prevalent in his times. A prefatory word is in place. The serious student will not look upon these concepts with an eye for criticism. The theory that the whole physical world is founded upon various combinations of four elements, was an Aristotelian legacy which ruled man’s minds for a millenium. The extension of that theory into the elusive world of the spirit was logical. That scientists today have moved to other theories to explain the universe and the various phenomena of life, has no bearing upon the explanations which were accepted in the past, for who can foretell what knowledge will do to “the established truths” of today? The important thing in Ramban’s presentation of this whole obstruse subject is his final conclusion that only G-d in His Providence exercises power over man’s destiny.</i> Now the cause of death generally is the separation [decomposition] of the components of the body, this being true of all kinds of bodies [whether they are composed of the four elements like humans or of only two, like <i>sheidim</i>]. The reason for their ability to fly is because of the lightness of the [two] elements [fire and air] of which they are composed, as may also be seen in the case of a fowl, in which, because the elements of fire and air dominate over the small parts of the other two elements [earth and water], the fowl can hover in the air and fly [although it is composed of all four elements]. Surely, then, the above-mentioned creatures that have nothing in them of the heavy elements [earth and water], possess great hovering power in the air, to be able to fly tirelessly. The matter of “eating” [mentioned above in connection with these creatures] means their deriving nourishment from the moisture of water and the odors of fire, something like the fire that <i>licked up the water that was in the trench</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 18:38.</i> This is the purpose of the burnings which necromancers perform to the demons. The reason [for their need to “eat”] is that the fire in the air causes the drying up of their bodies, which must therefore be restored just as man’s need for food is due to depletion in his body. As for that which has been said concerning their “hearing what is about to happen,” it is because in the course of their flying on high they become aware of things that are about to happen from the powerful forces contained in the atmosphere, these being “the princes of the quiver.”<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the forces involved in the movement of the constellations. See my Hebrew commentary p. 96.</i> It is also from there that “those who have wings tell matters”<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">The expression is based on Ecclesiastes 10:20: <i>For a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter</i>.</i> of the future, as has been tested by enchanters,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">See Maimonides’ “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 30-35.</i> and as I will explain in its place<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:9.</i> with the help of G-d. But neither of them know what is to happen <i>for many days to come and for times that are far off;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 12:27.</i> but they can only inform of that which is to happen in the near future, as we know from their encounters [i.e., those of enchanters], that they gain knowledge from the <i>sheidim</i> as to what has been decreed to come. Therefore Onkelos rendered the verse, <i>They sacrificed unto demons, ‘lo eloha’</i> (<i>no gods</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:17.</i> as “they sacrificed unto demons in which there is no utility,” meaning that there is no need for them, as they do not prevent harm that is destined to come, neither do they do anything productive, nor do they inform of times far off so that a person may knowingly guard himself. It is this which is the sense of the expression, <i>lo eloha</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:17.</i> which is as if it said, “no power or rulership,” for the word <i>Elokim</i> is an expression of strength and power, [a composite word consisting of the words] <i>e-il heim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban, Genesis 1:3 (Vol. I, p. 25) where he explains the name to mean: <i>e-il</i> (Force), <i>heim</i> (they), the word “they” alluding to all other forces. Thus <i>Elokim</i> means “the Force of all forces.”</i> Thus the verse is stating that demons have no strength or power whatsoever, and hence there is no need for them, <i>for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 10:5.</i>

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

FOR THE LIFE OF THE FLESH IS IN THE BLOOD; AND I HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU UPON THE ALTAR TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR YOUR SOULS. The sense of this verse is to state that He forbade us [to eat] blood because He has given it to us to be upon the altar and to effect atonement for our souls, and it is therefore the part dedicated to G-d, just as is the case with the forbidden fat.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 3:17.</i> And if one should ask: “Why then has He forbidden us to eat the blood of a wild animal and that of a fowl, from which offerings are not brought?” We will dismiss the questioner by saying that it was His wish to keep us far away from eating any kind of blood, in order that we should never make a mistake therein [and eat forbidden blood as a result of failing to distinguish between one kind of blood and another]. In the case of fat, however, He did not [categorically] forbid all kinds of fat, because [the permissible kind of fat] is distinguishable from the non-permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 3:9, that even in the same animal the prohibited fat is distinguishable from the permitted fat. So also are the fats of a permitted fowl and wild beast [which are permitted to be eaten] distinguishable from those fats of a permitted animal that may not be eaten. This is not so in the case of blood; hence He prohibited all blood, even that of fowls and wild animals which are not offered upon the altar.</i><br>Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed, III, 46.</i> that the Chaldeans loathed blood, considering it impure, and only those who sought to establish contact with the demons and to foretell the future would eat it. Now the Torah always seeks to destroy these foolish theories, by [ordaining measures which are] contrary to their ideas. Therefore He prohibited the eating of blood and chose it as the means of purifying [the impure] by means of the sprinklings thereof,<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Such as in the case of the leper (above, 14:14).</i> and to throw it upon the altar of G-d for atonement. Therefore He said, <i>I will set My face against that soul that eateth blood</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 10.</i> just as He said with reference to him who gives of his children to Molech,<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:6: <i>And I will set My face against that soul</i>.</i> because this [practice of eating blood] leads to a kind of idol worship, such words not being stated concerning any other commandment. Now these words [of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] are sensible in themselves, however the verses do not indicate [that the reason for the prohibition against eating blood is] so [as the Rabbi has said], for they always state the reason for that prohibition to be, <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 14.</i> <i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 11 before us.</i> And in the Book of Deuteronomy He again states, <i>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i><br>It is proper, therefore, to explain the reason for the prohibition against eating blood by saying that G-d created all lower creatures for the purpose of man, since only he amongst all of them recognizes his Creator. Nonetheless, He did not at first permit man to eat anything except for vegetation, but no living creatures at all, just as is stated in the Chapter of Creation where it is said, <i>Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed</i> etc. <i>for food</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:29. See Ramban there (Vol. I, pp. 57-58) for a full exposition of the thought presented here briefly.</i> but when the flood came and they [the lower creatures] were saved by the merit of Noah, and he brought offerings from them to G-d which were acceptable before Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 8:21.</i> He gave man permission to slaughter [and eat them], just as He said, <i>Every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given you all</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:3.</i> since their existence was because of man. Thus He permitted man to use their bodies for his benefit and needs because their life was on account of man’s sake, and that their soul [i.e., blood] should be used for man’s atonement when offering them up before Him, blessed be He, but not to eat it, since one creature possessed of a soul is not to eat another creature with a soul, for all souls belong to G-d. The life of man just as the life of the animal are all His, <i>even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 3:19.</i><br>Now in the opinion of the Greek philosopher [i.e., Aristotle] as interpreted by those who scrutinize his words, it was out of the Active Intellect<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">A concept of great significance in Medieval philosophy, the Active Intellect denoted an incorporeal substance, the role of which was to make the forms of the imagination “actual” objects of the intellect, after they have been only “potential” objects of the intellect. Yehudah Halevi in his “Al Khazari,” when presenting the view of the philosophers, writes of it: “This is the degree of the Active Intellect, namely, that angel whose degree is below the angel who is connected with the sphere of the moon” (p. 37). It is out of that Active Intellect that the animal soul originated.</i> that there emitted a very fine and bright flash and glitter of light, from which came forth the spark which is the soul of the animal. It is thus in a certain sense a real soul. It therefore has sufficient understanding to avoid harm, and to seek its welfare, and a sense of recognition towards those with whom it is familiar, and love towards them, just as dogs love their masters, and they have a wonderful sense of recognition of the people of their households, and similarly pigeons have a sense of knowledge and recognition. Now it is also known that the food one eats is taken into the body of the eater <i>and they become one flesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:24.</i> If one were to eat <i>the life of all flesh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 14.</i> it would then attach itself to one’s own blood and they would become united in one’s heart, and the result would be a thickening and coarsensss of the human soul so that it would closely approach the nature of the animal soul which resided in that which he ate, since blood does not require digestion as other foods do, which thereby become changed, and thus man’s soul will become combined with the blood of the animal! And Scripture states, <i>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 3:21.</i> It is for this reason that He said, <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the flesh thereof</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 14.</i> for all flesh, whether man or beast, has its soul in the blood, and it is not fitting to mix the soul that is destined to destruction with that which is to live [in the hereafter]. Rather, it is to be as an atonement upon the altar to be acceptable before G-d. This is the sense of the expression, <i>Therefore I said to the children of Israel: No soul of you shall eat blood</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12.</i> meaning: “Because the blood is identical with the soul, and it is not proper that one soul devour another, therefore I had compassion upon man’s life and gave it [the animal’s soul] to him upon the altar, so that the soul of the animal should effect atonement for his soul.” Thus we have been taught in the Sifre:<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, <i>R’eih</i> 76.</i> “<i>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> Rabbi Yehudah says, [From the fact that it states, <i>only be steadfast</i>, which indicates that a special effort was required], you learn that they were addicted to eating blood etc. <i>For the blood is the life</i><sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> — this teaches you why it was prohibited. <i>And thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:23.</i> — this prohibits the eating of a limb cut from a living animal.” This is a hint and proof for what we have explained. It is for this reason that He further commanded that we are to cover up all blood of an [edible] wild beast or fowl [which have been ritually slaughtered]<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> because their blood is not brought upon the altar, for even of fowls only two species [i.e., young pigeons and turtle doves] may be brought as offerings, and they too are not slaughtered [in the usual way];<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 1:15.</i> but in the case of cattle, most of them that are found among men may be slaughtered to the Glorious Name and their blood is used for atonement, and it is therefore not to be covered. There was no necessity to require the covering of the blood of an ordinary [unconsecrated] animal, since the slaughtering of cattle for ordinary meat was not permitted in the desert,<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, Verse 2.</i> and even afterwards [when Israel came into the Land of Israel and a meal of ordinary meat was permitted], the commandment of the Torah is directed to the majority [and since in most cases cattle were brought as offerings, and their blood would be needed for the altar, therefore He did not require covering of the blood even if the cattle were not slaughtered as offerings].

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

THE BLOOD THEREOF IS ‘B’NAFSHO’ (ALL ONE WITH THE LIFE THEREOF). “Its blood represents its life, since life is dependent upon the blood.” This is Rashi’s language. But it is not correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">From the language of Rashi it would appear that the substance of the blood is identical with the life of the animal, and that is not correct in Ramban’s opinion, since they are really two separate substances, and the blood of the animal is merely the “carrier” of its life. Hence Ramban will present other interpretations of the verse.</i> Rather, it is possible to explain that the word <i>b’nafsho</i> here means “in its body,” Scripture thus stating, “<i>for as to the life of all flesh</i>, it is the blood in its body.” Similarly [we find the word <i>nefesh</i> meaning “body” in these verses]: <i>‘Nafsho’</i> (<i>his person</i>) <i>was laid in iron;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 105:18.</i> <i>seventy ‘nefesh’</i> (<i>persons</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 1:5.</i> <i>he</i> [the Nazirite] <i>shall not come near to a dead ‘nefesh,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:6.</i> meaning “a body,” since “the body” of anyone that is possessed of a <i>nefesh</i> (soul) is also called <i>nefesh</i>.<br>In my opinion Scripture mentioned three expressions with reference to blood, which constitute but one reason. First it stated, <i>For the life of the flesh is in the blood</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> Then it changed and said [in Verse 14 before us], <i>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof</i>, meaning to say that the blood is the life, and the life is in the blood, as both are mixed together, similarly to wine when diluted with water, in which case the water is in the wine and the wine in the water, and each one is “in” the other. Afterwards it explained [in the second half of Verse 14 before us, stating <i>for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof</i>], that the blood is the very life, meaning to say that both have become one inseparable substance, so that you can never find blood without life nor life without blood, as is known of the air<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">The sense here is clearly “the force of the heart beat” pumping the blood. In Medieval learning it was explained as the element of air which originates in the heart, and which in turn supplies the blood and sustains the person.</i> which originates in the heart, that it is the <i>hyly</i><sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">A Greek term indicating the primary matter created by G-d (see Vol. I, p. 23), and here used in a wider sense as the force in the heart which is the primary organ of life.</i> from which proceed all dispositions [of man], supplying the substance which gives nutrition and makes blood, and it is the blood which in turn creates it and sustains it. [The relationship between life and blood is thus] like that of matter and form in all physical creatures, where the one cannot be found without the other. Now our Rabbis interpreted the three punishments of excision which Scripture mentioned with reference to blood<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 7:27; 17:10, and 14.</i> in the following way:<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Kerithoth 4 b.</i> “One verse prohibits the eating of that blood with which life escapes [when cutting the throat of the offering, since it has been given for atonement upon the altar]; one verse prohibits the eating of blood which escapes when slaughtering [an ordinary, unconsecrated animal], and one verse prohibits the eating of blood, that [of a fowl or wild animal, which when slaughtered] must be covered.” This saying of the Rabbis explains why the punishment of excision was mentioned three times, but the reason for the different Scriptural expressions concerning the life and the blood [of the animal] is as I have explained.

Chapter 18



Verse 1



Verse 2

SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Since this chapter deals with [the laws of] prohibited sexual intercourse which apply equally to all Israel, therefore He said only, <i>Speak unto the children of Israel</i>, and did not specify the priests but included them together. Therefore He said at first, <i>I am the Eternal your G-d</i>, just as He did in the Ten Commandments [which He began with the words, <i>I am the Eternal thy G-d</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:2.</i> And the meaning of the verse, <i>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: I am the Eternal your G-d</i>, is as if He said, “Say unto them in My Name, ‘I am the Eternal your G-d.’” Similarly, <i>Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them: Ye shall be holy, for I the Eternal your G-d am holy</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 19:2.</i> [means: “say unto them in My Name, ‘Ye shall be holy'”].<br>It is possible that the reason [why the verse does not say: “this is what G-d commanded,” is not because it means: “say unto them in My Name” as explained above, but] is rather as follows: When Moses came out from before the Eternal without the veil<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:33-35.</i> [on his face], <i>and he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> he did not need to say to them: “Thus said the Eternal,” for it was known to them that it was His spirit that spoke through him [Moses] and His word was upon his tongue,<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">See II Samuel 23:2. Hence it is no longer necessary to explain the meaning of the verse to be [as we said above]: “<i>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</i> in My Name, <i>I am the Eternal your G-d</i>,” since it was known to them that Moses did not speak in his own name.</i> and that he did not speak in his own name. Similarly, in many places in the Book of Deuteronomy it is stated in the same way, such as: <i>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments, which I command you this day … that I will give the rain of your Land … And I will give grass in thy fields</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 11:13-15.</i> and [it is known that] Moses is not the one <i>who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Job 5:10.</i> and makes the grass grow in the fields, but it is G-d, blessed be He [that does these things]. Similarly it is said, <i>But the Eternal hath not given you a heart to know … And I have led you forty years in the desert … Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye might know that I am the Eternal your G-d</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 29:3-5. The opening verse [<i>But the Eternal</i> …] clearly indicates that the expression in the following verse, <i>And I have led you</i> etc. is also a reference to the Eternal, and not to Moses.</i> The meaning of the expression <i>to love the Eternal your G-d</i><sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 11:13.</i> [which is stated in the third person, when that same verse begins in the first person, <i>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments</i>], has already been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:1 (towards end — Vol. II, p. 422-3).</i>

Verse 3

According to the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, the Scriptural command, <i>After the doings of the land of Egypt … shall ye not do</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> is a reference to [the practice of sacrificing to] the demons mentioned above [in 17:7]; <i>and after the doings of the land of Canaan … shall ye not do</i><sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> is an allusion to the forbidden sexual relationships, in which the Canaanites <i>were very bad and sinful</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 13:13.</i> as He stated at the end of this section, <i>For all these abominations have the men of the Land done</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 27.</i> And in the opinion of our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 9:3.</i> the Egyptians were also addicted to carnality, in all forms of the forbidden relationships, and with males and cattle. This is the truth, [as Scripture states] that <i>there were also sodomites in the Land</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 14:24. The verse concludes: <i>they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Eternal drove out before the children of Israel</i>.</i> referring [to <i>the abominations of the nations</i>] which were there from the beginning till now. Scripture further testifies concerning them, <i>the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 16:26.</i> and it further says, <i>whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:20.</i> the term “flesh” being a euphemism [for the sexual organ]. Similarly, in the expressions, <i>his flesh ran with his issue</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 15:2.</i> <i>and her issue in her flesh be blood</i><sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> [the term “flesh” is an allusion to the sexual organ].

Verse 4

MINE ORDINANCES SHALL YE DO. “These are matters prescribed in the Torah which, even if they were not prescribed, one would know that they ought to be prescribed.” Thus the language of Rashi. And in the Torath Kohanim it is stated:<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 13:10.</i> “These are matters written in the Torah which, even if they were not written, would deserve to have been written, such as robberies, forbidden sexual relationships, idolatry, bloodshed and blasphemy.”<br>Now by way of the simple meaning of Scripture, the term <i>mishpatai</i> (Mine ordinances) is to be understood in its simple sense. It is a reference to the laws stated in the section of <i>V’eileh Hamishpatim</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:1.</i> and in the whole Torah. Therefore He states here, <i>which if a man do, he shall live by them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 5.</i> as these laws were given so that man should live, and for the development of countries, and peace among men, so that no one should cause harm to his fellowman or kill him. The prophet Ezekiel likewise mentioned many times with reference to these <i>mishpatim</i> (ordinances), <i>which if a man do, he shall live by them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 20:11, 13 and 21.</i> while of the Sabbath he says, <i>to be a sign between Me and them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> Similarly in the Book of Nehemiah it says, <i>Thine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 9:29.</i> But our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 85 b.</i> “<i>He shall live by them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 5.</i> — but not die by them. This teaches that danger to live overrides the Sabbath laws and [all] the commandments.” And according to the Midrashic interpretation it means:<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 9:10. It is also mentioned here in Rashi.</i> “<i>He shall live by them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 5.</i> — in the World to Come. Should you say it means that he shall live in this world, will he not in the end die!”<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the Divine assurance that <i>he shall live by them</i> must refer to eternal life.</i> And if so, the expression <i>which if a man do, he shall live by them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 5.</i> refers back [not only to the <i>mishpatim</i> (ordinances), as we explained before, but] also to <i>chukothai</i> [“My statutes,” those laws for which no reason is given, but the observance of which also assures one <i>eternal</i> life].<br>Know that man’s [reward in] life for the observance of the commandments is in accordance with his preparation for them. For he who fulfills the commandments not for their own sake, but in order to receive a reward, will be rewarded on account of them in this world with longevity, riches, possessions, and honor. It is concerning this [kind of observance of the laws of the Torah] that it is said, <i>in her left hand are riches and honor</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 3:16.</i> which the Rabbis interpreted to mean:<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 63 a.</i> “to those that stand on the left of it [i.e., to those who engage in the observance of the Torah not for its own sake], there are material riches and honor.” Similarly, those who engage in the observance of the commandments so as to merit by them reward in the World to Come, these being the people who serve G-d out of fear [of punishment], will be found worthy on account of their intention to be saved from the judgments that will come upon the wicked, and their souls shall abide in joyfulness<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalms 25:13.</i> [in life eternal]. But those who engage in the observance of the commandments out of love, as is right and proper, together with worldly occupation, similar to what is mentioned in the Torah in the section of <i>Im Bechukothai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote"><i>If ye walk in My statutes</i>. Further, 26:3.</i> <i>And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> they will merit good life in this world according to the usual nature of things, and in life eternal, in the World to Come, their merits will still be complete before them [since the reward they received in their lifetime will not reduce that which is to come to them in the hereafter]. But those who abandon altogether the concerns of this world and pay no attention to it, acting as if they themselves were not creatures of physical being, and all their thoughts and intentions are directed only to their Creator, just as was the case with Elijah, [these people] on account of their soul cleaving to the Glorious Name will live forever in body and soul, as is evidenced in Scripture concerning Elijah<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 2:11: <i>and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven</i>.</i> and as is known of him in tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud and Midrashim abound in instances which prove that Elijah’s removal from earth was no interruption of his earthly existence. On the contrary, in countless appearances he traverses the world in order to protect the innocent etc. (see L.

Many Midrashim describe his activity after his ascencion into heaven. See, however, Rashi <i>ibid.</i></i> and of those belonging to the World to Come who will rise at the resurrection. It is for this reason that on the subject of reward for observance of the commandments the verses speak [in various ways, such as]: <i>that thy days may be long;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:12.</i> <i>that thou mayest live;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:20.</i> <i>and that thou mayest prolong thy days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 22:7.</i> For these expressions include all kinds of life, each according to his due.

Verse 5



Verse 6

NONE OF YOU SHALL APPROACH TO ANY THAT IS NEAR OF KIN TO HIM, TO UNCOVER THEIR NAKEDNESS. The reason for the prohibition of sexual relationships with one’s near of kin is not expressly written [in the Torah]. The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed III, 49.</i> that [this law seeks to inculcate the lessons that] we should limit sexual intercourse, hold it in contempt, and perform it rarely. Now these women which Scripture has forbidden amongst the relatives of one’s wife are forbidden because they are constantly together with him in his house,<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">“For as a rule, the mother of the wife, her grandmother, daughter, granddaughter, and sister-in-law are often with her; the husband meets them always when he goes out, when he comes in, and when he is at his work” (<i>ibid.</i>, Friedlander’s translation). Now “if we were allowed to marry any of them, and were only precluded from sexual intercourse with them without marriage, most people would constantly become guilty of misconduct with them. But as they are entirely forbidden to us … there is reason to expect that people will not seek it, and will not think of it” (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> and the same applies to one’s own relatives [sisters, aunts, and the wife of one’s uncle], who are frequently with him and he is closeted together with them. A similar reason the Rabbi states for all forbidden relations. Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already written<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse before us.</i> likewise that since the passion of man’s heart is like that of the animals, it was impossible for Scripture to forbid all females, and therefore it prohibited only those that are available to him at all times. But this is a very weak reason, that Scripture should make a person liable to the punishment of excision in the case of these forbidden relations, just because they are sometimes found together with him, and at the same time permit a man to marry many women, even in the hundreds and thousands! And what harm would there be if a man would marry only his daughter, just as was permitted to the Noachides,<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 58 b.</i> or marry two sisters as did our patriarch Jacob? A person also could not do better than to give his daughter in marriage to his elder son, and they would inherit his possessions and multiply and increase in his house, for <i>He created not</i> the earth <i>a waste, He formed it to be inhabited</i>!<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 45:18.</i> We have no tradition as to [the reason of] this prohibition of forbidden relationships, but logically it would appear that there is in this matter one of the secrets of creation, which attaches to the soul and is part of the secret of the transmigration [of souls], to which we have already alluded.<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 38:8 (Vol. I, pp. 469-470).</i><br>Know that sexual intercourse is held distant and in contempt in the Torah unless it is for the preservation of the human species, and therefore where there can be no offspring [such as in pederasty or carnal intercourse with beasts], it is forbidden. Similarly, where [the union is such that] the child born therefrom will not have a healthy existence, nor succeed from it, the Torah prohibited such a union. This is the sense of the expressions: <i>el kol ‘sh’eir’ b’saro</i> [literally: <i>to any ‘flesh’ next to his flesh</i>]; <i>for he hath made naked ‘eth sh’eiro’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 29:19. See Ramban on Exodus 21:9 (Vol. II, pp. 356-7), where he elaborates on the meaning of this word <i>sh’eir</i>.</i> [literally: <i>his flesh</i>]. Thus the Torah forbade these marriages on account of <i>sh’eir</i> [i.e., because the forbidden relations constitute “flesh” next to one’s own], the term <i>sh’eir</i> being derived from the expression [in the verse], <i>‘hanish’ar’</i> (<i>he that is left</i>) <i>in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 4:3. The term <i>sh’eir</i> denoting “flesh” or “relative” is something which “remains” with a person, as it is his own or next to his flesh.</i> Hence Scripture states, <i>they are ‘sha’arah’</i> (<i>near kinswomen</i>); <i>it is lewdness</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 17.</i> meaning to say, “these are not marriages, nor fit for such a relationship, for they will not succeed [in having healthy offspring, as explained above]; rather it is lewdness, mere thoughts of indecency.” Thus the forbidden relationships are included in “the statutes,” the laws which constitute “the decrees of the King.” Now a decree is an ordinance which originates in the knowledge of the King, Who is wise in the management of His kingdom, and it is He Who knows the need for and the benefit of the command that He ordained, and He does not tell it to anyone except to His wise counsellors.

Verse 7

THE NAKEDNESS OF THY FATHER, AND THE NAKEDNESS OF THY MOTHER, SHALT THOU NOT UNCOVER. Rashi commented: “<i>The nakedness of thy father</i> — this refers to thy father’s wife. <i>And the nakedness of thy mother</i> — this is intended to include one’s own mother, although she be not the wife of one’s father. <i>The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover</i><sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> — this is intended to include in this prohibition one’s father’s wife even after [the father’s] death.” Similarly Rashi explained: “<i>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> And what does this [uncovering of his] nakedness mean? <i>Thou shalt not approach to his wife</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> This is indeed true according to the correct sense [of the verses]. But in the Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 54 a.</i> the Rabbis concluded that the verses, <i>the nakedness of thy father</i>, and <i>the nakedness of thy father’s brother</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> are prohibitions against carnal relationships with these males themselves [and not with their wives], and [are required] to make the offender liable to a double penalty if he committed it in error [lying carnally with his father or uncle].<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">If the sin were committed knowingly, there would be no point in saying that “a double penalty is incurred,” since the punishment for either of these two sins is death by stoning, and death cannot be inflicted more than once. Hence “the double penalty” must be where he committed it unwittingly, in which case he must bring two sin-offerings. See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 315-317.</i> But I wonder, according to the opinion of the Sages [who explain the verse, <i>the nakedness of thy father</i> as being a prohibition against lying carnally with one’s father], why did He not likewise admonish against lying carnally with a son or brother, in addition to prohibiting [sexual relationships with their] wives?<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 15-16.</i> Perhaps the Torah was more particular in guarding the honor of the elders. However, each and every verse in this section [of forbidden relationships] constitutes only one prohibition,<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the verse before us, <i>the nakedness of thy father and the nakedness of thy mother</i> does not constitute two separate prohibitions as Rashi explained it [one referring to one’s father’s wife, and one to one’s own mother although she is not the wife of one’s father, as stated above], but they are one prohibition, as explained further on in the text.</i> there being here no case of two admonitions in one prohibition, for the command concerning sisters [in Verse 9] and also daughters [in Verse 10] each constitute but one prohibition [and not, as Rashi explained there, that each verse contains two prohibitions]. The correct interpretation by way of the simple meaning of Scripture appears to me to be that <i>the nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother</i> [<i>shalt thou not uncover</i>], constitute but one negative commandment and one admonition, which forbids intercourse with one’s own mother, for in having such intercourse he thereby uncovers the nakedness of his father and that of his mother. This is the sense of the [concluding] expression in this verse, <i>she is thy mother</i>, meaning that you have done with her two evils, in that you have uncovered the nakedness of your mother and that of your father. Following the admonition against uncovering the nakedness of one’s father, which refers [as explained] to one’s mother, He went back [in the following Verse 8] and admonished against [uncovering] the nakedness of one’s father’s wife, although she be not one’s mother, saying, <i>The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover; it is thy father’s nakedness</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> Similarly, <i>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother</i><sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> means [as the verse itself continues], <i>thou shalt not approach to his wife</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> This is why it does not say “and” to [<i>his wife thou shalt not approach</i>].

Verse 8



Verse 9

THE NAKEDNESS OF THY SISTER, THE DAUGHTER OF THY FATHER, OR THE DAUGHTER OF THY MOTHER, WHETHER BORN AT HOME, OR BORN ABROAD, EVEN THEIR NAKEDNESS THOU SHALT NOT UNCOVER. “<i>Whether born at home, or born abroad</i> — this means whether [the court] says to your father, ‘Keep her mother as your wife,’ or whether it has to say to him, ‘Divorce her mother,’ as for instance when she [i.e., the mother] is a <i>mamzereth</i> or a <i>nethinah</i>” [a <i>mamzereth</i> is the female product from one of the forbidden sexual relationships in this section, and a <i>nethinah</i> is a female descendant of the Gibeonites — relationships with these women being in both cases punishable by whipping]. Thus the language of Rashi. But it is not correct, since this interpretation leads to the conclusion that a sister that is born from [a woman who is herself one of] the relations forbidden [to his father],<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if his mother had sexual relationships with one of the forbidden <i>relations</i>, the penalty for which is excision [and not mere whipping], it would follow that the child born from that union is not included under the terms of this prohibition; since by stating these two examples — that the mother was either a <i>mamzereth</i> or a <i>nethinah</i>, with whom, in both of which cases, sexual intercourse is punishable only with whipping — Rashi thereby seems to exclude from this verse the case where the mother was one of the forbidden <i>relations</i>, where the penalty is excision! This conclusion is obviously incorrect.</i> is not included in this prohibition [against marrying one’s sister. For since Rashi explained the expressions <i>whether born at home, or born abroad</i> as referring to the <i>mother</i>, whether she is a lawful wife or a <i>mamzereth</i> or <i>nethinah</i>, both of whom are forbidden to the father only by punishment of whipping, and not by excision, unlike all forbidden relations, then the illogical result follows that if the mother <i>were</i> one of those relations forbidden to his father by punishment of excision, then the son’s sister born from that union would not be included in this prohibition]! And yet all [sisters] are forbidden by excision [i.e., regardless of whether the sister was born of a union itself permitted, or forbidden by whipping only, or by excision], unless she be born of a bondwoman or a Cuthean woman [in which case she is not considered his sister at all]!<br>And I wonder at the Rabbi [Rashi]! For in the Gemara of Tractate Yebamoth<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 23 a.</i> in the second chapter it is clearly stated: “Perhaps I can say that this excludes a sister born of a union forbidden by whipping [as in the case where his father married a <i>mamzereth</i> and she gave birth to a daughter, for I might say that the marriage, being forbidden, had no validity, and she is therefore not his ‘sister’ in the sense that she is included in the prohibition against having intercourse with one’s sister]! Said Rav Papa: In unions punishable by whipping, the marriage, [although forbidden], has legal validity. For it is written, <i>If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 21:15.</i> Now is there before G-d a beloved one and a hated one [i.e., could it be supposed that the law should allow discrimination between the children of a favored wife and those of a hated wife]? Rather, you must say ‘beloved’ denotes ‘beloved for her well-chosen marriage’ [i.e., that it was blameless, since it was within the law], and ‘hated’ means ‘hated for her [illicit] marriage.’ And the Merciful One states, <i>‘ki thihyena l’ish’</i> (<i>if a man ‘have’</i>) — <i>two wives</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>thihyena</i> is a word indicating legal status of marriage. Thus you must say that in the case of a marriage which is “hated” because it is punishable merely by whipping, [as in the case of a man marrying a <i>mamzereth</i>], the act of betrothal <i>does</i> take effect, and the daughter born from such a union is considered one’s “sister” with respect to the prohibition before us.</i> Perhaps I might say that this excludes a sister born of a union punishable by excision [so that she is not his ‘sister’ in the sense that she is included in the prohibition against having intercourse with one’s sister]! Said Rava: Scripture states, <i>The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad</i>, which means whether [the court] can say to your father, ‘Keep [the mother as your wife],’ or whether it has to say to him, <i>‘Hotzei’</i> [as explained further on], and yet the Merciful One states that she is <i>thy sister</i>!”<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">Since Verse 9 before us begins, <i>The nakedness of ‘thy sister,’</i> and yet goes on to mention the one <i>‘born abroad,’</i> it is clear that even a daughter born of a union which is punishable by excision [as explained further on], is a “sister” with respect to this prohibition.</i> Now the meaning of the word <i>hotzei</i> is that [the court] tells him, “Take her out from your house, for she is not your [legitimate] wife, and the act of marriage has no legal validity in those cases where the union is punishable by excision or by any of the [four] deaths by the hand of the court.” And yet notwithstanding this, one is punished for having intercourse with her because she <i>is</i> considered his sister!<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">It is thus clear that even if the mother were one of those forbidden relations to his father with whom sexual intercourse is punishable by excision, the daughter born is still forbidden as a “sister.” This does not appear to be so from the language of Rashi before us, who singled out cases of marriages forbidden only by whipping, in which cases the betrothal is valid! See above, Note 270.</i> Only one’s sister born from a bondwoman or a Cuthean woman is not included in this prohibition, since the offspring is of her own [legal] standing.<br>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture the verse is stating: “<i>The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born</i> of a marriage, as when the father brought the woman into the home as a wife [and she gave birth to a daughter], <i>or born abroad</i>, as when the man found her outside, <i>and lay hold on her, and lie with her</i><sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:28.</i> and she gave him birth [to a daughter], <i>thou shalt not uncover their nakedness</i>.” Thus He mentioned [the prohibition concerning] a mother’s daughter whether she be born in wedlock or from unchastity. For even though in either case she is only his mother’s daughter and not his father’s daughter, [and if so, why did Scripture have to mention both cases], yet one might have thought that a brotherly relationship [forbidding sexual intercourse] applies only to a sister born in wedlock, but not to one born from unchastity, where everything is “free;” therefore Scripture had to admonish against all [kinds of sisters]. There is yet another verse which He stated with reference to one’s father’s daughter, stating <i>The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father</i> [<i>thou shalt not uncover</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> this being [a prohibition against having intercourse with] a sister who is one’s father’s daughter born of his legitimate wife. It was necessary that He state this, because having said [in Verse 9 before us], <i>the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father</i>, without any qualification, and then in connection with <i>the daughter of thy mother</i> He explained <i>whether born at home</i> through marriage, <i>or born abroad</i> through unchastity, one might therefore have thought that one’s father’s daughter born in unchastity is permissible to him; for perhaps the Torah was not particular about a man’s offspring born in unchastity, because these are not known to him; therefore He said in explanation, <i>The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter</i> [<i>thou shalt not uncover</i>], thus declaring that the daughter of one’s father mentioned at first [in Verse 9 before us] is not one’s father’s daughter born of his legitimate wife [since that is specifically mentioned further on in Verse 11]. Also, because in the case of the Noachides the prohibition [against sexual intercourse] was only if the brotherhood was from the same mother, and not [if it was exclusively] from the father, Scripture therefore explains that with respect to Israelites, all are alike in the prohibition [whether they are born of one father or one mother].<br>The correct interpretation of this verse is what the Sages have said in the Gemara of Tractate Yebamoth;<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 22a.</i> “A man who has intercourse with his sister, who is also the daughter of his father’s wife [through marriage]<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">So explained <i>ibid.</i>, in Rashi.</i> who is not his mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is not found in our Gemara, but it is a correct explanation.</i> is guilty both on account of his sister, and his father’s wife’s daughter.” And there in the Gemara the Rabbis explained the reason: “Observe, it is written, <i>the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father</i> etc.; what need was there for the expression, <i>the nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter</i> etc.?<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> In order to teach that he is guilty both on account of his sister, and his father’s wife’s daughter.” Thus Scripture repeats certain prohibitions in order to make one [who commits these abominable practices] guilty on many counts, for even with reference to creeping things [which we are forbidden to eat] He has repeated many prohibitions regarding one matter, in order to punish the offender on all counts.

Verse 17

IT IS ‘ZIMAH’ (LEWDNESS). Onkelos translated: “it is a sinful plan,” and Rashi commented thereon, “because your evil inclination counsels you to sin.” But I know of no sense to this, for with regard to all forbidden relations and all other transgressions, it is the evil inclination that counsels one to sin! [Why then is this verse prohibiting intercourse with a woman and her daughter, singled out by the use of this expression?] But the meaning of the matter is that the term <i>zimah</i> is derived from the expression, <i>as ‘zamam’</i> (<i>he had purposed</i>) <i>to do unto his brother</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 19:19.</i> A proper thought is called <i>m’zimah</i>, as it said, <i>And no ‘m’zimah’</i> (<i>purpose</i>) <i>can be withholden from Thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">Job 42:2.</i> and lewdness that is thought of in secret is called <i>zimah</i>, similar to that which it is said, <i>If my heart have been enticed unto a woman</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31:9.</i> and Scripture concludes, <i>For that were ‘zimah’</i> (<i>a heinous crime</i>); <i>yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11.</i> Similarly, <i>‘v’zimatheich’</i> (<i>thy lewdness</i>) <i>and thy harlotries;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 23:29.</i> <i>‘v’zimath’</i> (<i>the lewdness of</i>) <i>thy harlotry</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 13:27.</i> denoting these illicit acts committed in private and in public. In my opinion Scripture states <i>it is ‘zimah’</i>, in the case of [sexual relationships with] a woman and her daughter, and also a woman and her mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:14.</i> in order to condemn the matter, saying that when one lies with the one, who is his wife, he thinks of the other one on account of their relationship and likeness, and thus lying with both of them is a cause of lewdness to him. This matter is similar to that which the Rabbis have mentioned:<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim 20 b.</i> “<i>And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 20:38.</i> These are the children [who are the offspring] of nine different dispositions [in their parents] etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">And one of these classifications is “the offspring of the hated one,” for since her husband hates her, his thoughts are of another woman, and it is therefore an act of lewdness (Rashi, Nedarim).</i> It is for this reason that Scripture states here, <i>the nakedness of a woman and her daughter</i> etc., and similarly it says, <i>And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:14.</i> and does not say “the nakedness of your wife’s daughter, or your wife’s mother, you shalt not uncover” [but rather mentions them in each case together, by saying: <i>the nakedness of a woman and her mother</i>, or <i>the nakedness of a woman and her daughter</i>, in order to indicate that the prohibition is on account of thinking of the two together]. And the explanation of the verses here is as follows: At the beginning of the section He said, <i>None of you shall approach to any that is ‘sh’eir’</i> (<i>near of</i>) <i>flesh to him, to uncover their nakedness</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 6.</i> thus prohibiting [sexual intercourse with] those who are near of flesh to him, and He stated the reason for this to be, <i>for theirs is thine own nakedness</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> and so now [in Verse 17 before us] where He prohibits the wife’s relations, He states <i>‘sha’arah heinah’</i> (<i>they are near kinswomen</i>), meaning to say that they are also forbidden because they [the women] are near of flesh to each other, and lying with both of them would be lewdness, as I have explained. Similarly Scripture states, <i>and each hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 22:11.</i> meaning that he defiled her to her husband, for even when she will be with her husband, she will think of his father because of their likeness. Now Scripture calls lying with animals <i>tevel hu</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> denoting [as Rashi explained] “the mingling [from the root <i>balal</i>] of the human semen with that of the animal,” and so it also says of lying with a daughter-in-law that <i>they have done ‘tevel,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:12.</i> meaning that father and son will become joined to her as one person, and she will lie with both of them together in thought.

Verse 18

AND THOU SHALT NOT TAKE A WOMAN TO HER SISTER, TO BE A RIVAL TO HER, TO UNCOVER HER NAKEDNESS, BESIDE THE OTHER IN HER LIFETIME. Here Scripture explains the reason for the prohibition, stating that it is not proper for you to take a woman in addition to her sister, to be a rival one to another, for it is fitting that they love one another and not be rivals. He did not say so with respect to a woman and her daughter,<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 17.</i> or a woman and her mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:14.</i> because they are “near of flesh” and therefore forbidden even after the death of the other [while in the case of two sisters, it is only during the lifetime of his wife, even if she is already divorced from him, that he may not marry her sister].

Verse 19

AND UNTO A WOMAN DURING HER SEPARATION FOR HER UNCLEANNESS, THOU SHALT NOT APPROACH TO UNCOVER HER NAKEDNESS. Scripture prohibited [having intercourse with] a menstruant woman for the reason I have mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 6.</i> that the Torah permitted sexual intercourse only for the sake of raising children,<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">See my Hebrew commentary p. 104, that Rabbeinu Bachya questioned this attitude of Ramban. It would also appear from Ramban’s quote of Ibn Ezra further on in Verse 20, that the purpose of sexual intercourse is threefold, and the raising of children is only one purpose. Hence Ramban’s statement here must be understood in the sense that the “principal” purpose thereof is the raising of children.</i> and since the whole child or the greater part thereof is created out of the woman’s blood, as I have already mentioned,<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">Above, at beginning of <i>Seder Tazria</i>.</i> and from the blood of menstruation it is not created at all [therefore the Torah prohibited intercourse with her during the period of her impurity]. Indeed, how could a child be formed out of this blood, since it is deadly poisonous, capable of causing the death of any creature that drinks or eats it! Now when the womb contains a large amount of this blood of menstruation, the woman cannot become pregnant, as this blood is not endowed at all with the capacity for forming [a child]. Even if she were to become pregnant from other blood, and then derive nourishment from this blood, the child would die. Physicians have also mentioned already that if the foetus derives nourishment from the best of blood, and all its nutriment be of the best quality, but some of this blood of menstruation is mixed with it, it will cause it to go bad, and produce in the child inflammatory swellings and sores of all kinds. And in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">Tanchuma, <i>Metzora</i> 1.</i> even if a small part of this [blood of menstruation] remains, in the foetus, the child will be a leper. By virtue, then, of all these reasons it was fitting that the Torah prohibit intercourse with a menstruant. The doctors have also told us in connection with it, a true experience, which is one of <i>the wondrous works of Him Who is perfect in knowledge</i><sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">Job 37:16.</i> in creation, that if a menstruant woman at the beginning of her issue were to concentrate her gaze for some time upon a polished iron mirror, there would appear in the mirror red spots resembling drops of blood, for the bad part therein [i.e., in the issue] that is by its nature harmful, causes a certain odium, and the unhealthy condition of the air attaches to the mirror, just as a viper kills with its gaze. And surely it is harmful to have intercourse with her then, since physically and mentally she is attached to the man’s body and mind. Therefore Scripture prohibited it by saying, <i>and her impurity will be upon him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 15:24.</i> meaning that her condition is a contagious one. It is with reference to this that it states, <i>the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 36:17.</i> always mentioning in connection with her the term “impurity,” which is like that used in speaking of a creeping thing and of a leper, in which cases their impurity is within their bodies. It is possible that this is the sense of the expression, <i>he hath bared her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:18.</i> for that blemished fountain should be covered, and not bared in order to draw its bad and extremely harmful waters. Thus intercourse has been prohibited to <i>the holy seed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:13.</i> all the days of her impurity, until she immerses herself in water [i.e., in a ritual pool],<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">For no amount of washing the body can take the place of ritual immersion, where such is prescribed.</i> for then she will be purified also in her thoughts,<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">This is obviously a reference to what Rambam wrote in his Mishneh Torah at the end of <i>Hilchoth Mikvaoth</i>, on the significance of immersion, that it is not merely a matter of removing mud or dirt which may be removed by water, but “it is a Scriptural decree, the validity of the act depending upon the disposition of the heart. It is for this reason that the Sages have said. ‘If he immersed himself without intention, it is as though he had not immersed himself at all’ (Chagigah 18 b) … Thus he whose heart intends to purify himself, becomes purified as soon as the [actual] immersion is accomplished.” It is clear, then, that since both body and soul must participate in the act of immersion, the effect and potency of the purification applies to both body and soul as Ramban here states, “for then she will be purified also in her thoughts, and become completely clean.” See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 117-119.</i> and become completely clean [in body and mind].

Verse 20

AND THOU SHALT NOT LIE CARNALLY<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “to seed.” See text further.</i> WITH THY NEIGHBOR’S WIFE. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: “For there is a threefold purpose to sexual intercourse: one is to beget children, a second is to relieve the body of its fluids, and the third is for passion, which is likened to that of the animals. Now when Scripture said <i>l’zara</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “to seed.” See text further.</i> it means ‘even <i>l’zara</i>’ [i.e., even for the purpose of begetting children], and thus it prohibited [having intercourse with another man’s wife] altogether.” It is possible that He said <i>l’zara</i> in order to mention the reason for the prohibition, since it will not be known to whom “the child” belongs, and as a result, great and wicked abominations<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 8:6 and 9.</i> might be done by both.<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., both the child and the father. For not knowing their true relationship, they might marry one of the forbidden relations, etc.</i> Now Scripture did not mention [this expression <i>l’zara</i> further on when it speaks] of the punishment [for this sin],<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:10: <i>And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife … both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death</i>.</i> because even for intimacy of the first stage without emitting seed, he is already liable to punishment. It is for this reason that [in the case of a suspected adulteress] Scripture states, <i>and a man lie with her carnally</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 5:13. The Hebrew <i>shichvath zera</i> literally means “a lying of seed.”</i> for it is on account of the <i>zera</i><sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “seed.” In the light of what Ramban has written above, it may also mean that his jealousy is aroused on account of his children, whose legitimacy will henceforth be questioned.</i> that he suspects her. Similarly in the case of a betrothed bondswoman it also says, <i>lieth carnally</i><sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 19:20. Here too the term used is <i>shichvath zera</i>, which literally means “a lying of seed.”</i> with her, because the prohibition is on account of the child that he will beget from a bondwoman [who is betrothed to a Hebrew servant].<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote">Kerithoth 11 a.</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that since another man’s wife is completely forbidden to one, <i>whosoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 6:29.</i> therefore Scripture had to say here <i>l’zara</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “to seed.” See text further.</i> For had it said only: “and thou shalt not lie with thy neighbor’s wife,” it would have appeared that it forbids [by punishment of excision] even lying with her just for embracing and kissing, since here [in this section] it speaks only of those forbidden relations that are punishable with excision. Therefore it was necessary to mention that the intimacy was <i>l’zara</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “to seed.” See text further.</i> in order to explain that He is prohibiting here sexual intercourse. This is also the reason for the expression in the case of the betrothed bondswoman,<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 19:20. Here too the term used is <i>shichvath zera</i>, which literally means “a lying of seed.”</i> because she is like another man’s wife. Similarly it states in the case of another man’s wife, <i>And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:10.</i> and it does not state “lieth,” for it is not mere lying with her that He prohibits [under punishment of death]. He does not state here [in the verse before us forbidding intercourse with another man’s wife], “to uncover her nakedness,” for He only mentions this expression with reference to the next of kin and a menstruant,<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i> since the prohibition there is because of the uncovering, just as He said, <i>for he hath made naked his near kin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:19.</i>

Verse 21

AND THOU SHALT NOT GIVE ANY OF THY SEED ‘L’HA’AVIR’ (TO PASS THROUGH)<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to let any of them pass through [the fire] to Molech. The implications will be fully discussed in the text.</i> ‘LAMOLECH’ (TO MOLECH). This was an idol the name of which was “Molech.” Scripture mentions it with the definite article,<sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote">Since the prefix <i>lamed</i> [in the word <i>lamolech</i>] is vowelled with a <i>pathach</i> [instead of with a <i>shva</i> which would have made it <i>l’molech</i>], it is quite clear that it is speaking of an idol that is known. See Ramban on Exodus 22:19. (Vol. II, p. 390) quoting Rashi.</i> since it was well-known to them from Egypt. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that it is possible that Molech is identical with <i>Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 11:5.</i> And so indeed it would appear, for it is written, <i>Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the detestation of Moab … and for Molech the detestation of the children of Ammon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">323</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7. Milcom of Verse 5, is thus identical with Molech of Verse 7. Hence the idol by the name of Molech mentioned here in the Torah appears to be, as Ibn Ezra wrote, <i>Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites</i>.</i> And this [name Milcom] was also well-known to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">324</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intention is to forestall the following question: If, as we have said, Molech is the same as Milcom, why does Scripture call Milcom <i>the detestation of the children of Ammon</i>, when from the text here before us in the Torah it is plain that they knew the idol already from Egypt [as is explained in the text above]? To this question Ramban answers that it was also known to them by the name “Milcom” [in the time of Solomon]. Hence Scripture used that name.</i><br>Now Rashi commented: “And this was the manner in which the Molech was worshipped: he [the father] would hand over his son to the priests, and the priests lit two large pyres [one opposite the other], and they made the child pass on foot between the two fires. <i>Thou shalt not give</i>, this refers to [the father] handing over [the child] to the priests. <i>‘L’ha’avir lamolech’</i> is the passing through the open fire.” But this is not correct. For the Rabbis have already said in the Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i> “If he made him pass on foot [between the fires] the father is free from punishment [because that was not the customary way of worshipping the idol]; rather, [he is liable only if it was] ‘like a leaping place of Purim,’”<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">“Like children leaping over a bonfire” (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>). The Talmudic text <i>k’mishvarto d’puria</i> is thus explained by Rashi “as a leaping place of Purim,” i.e., like a bonfire made on Purim for merriment, over which children leap. Ramban will later on explain that at the Molech the child was passed through the flames so many times that the flames actually burnt him.</i> meaning that he made him pass through the actual fire [by leaping through it]. Scripture mentions [both conditions to make the father liable to punishment]: a “giving” as it is said, <i>and thou shalt not ‘give’ any of thy seed</i> …], and the act of making him “pass through the fire” [as it is said in Deuteronomy 18:10: <i>There shall not be found among you anyone that ‘maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire’</i>], so that the father does not incur punishment unless he delivers his child to the priests [of Molech] and he [i.e., the father] made him pass through the fire, as is explained in Tractate Sanhedrin.<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i> Similarly, that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote that the father hands him over to the priests and they make him pass through the fire — and so he wrote also in his commentaries to Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 64 a.</i> — that does not appear to be so from the language of the Rabbis here in the Gemara.<sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara speaks there of a case where “he made all his offspring pass through the fire” — an expression which indicates that it is the father himself who makes them pass through the fire.</i> Moreover, how could the father be liable to death for the worship of Molech done by others [i.e., the priests]?<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, if, as Rashi said, it is the priests who perform the rite of passing the child through the fire, it is they who do the forbidden act of worship and not the father. So how could he be made liable to punishment for the act of other people? The mere handing over of the child to the priests is not in itself an act of worship.</i> The very language of Scripture, <i>that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:10.</i> indicates that it is the father himself who passes him through the fire. Rather, the matter is as follows: the father himself delivers the child to the priests in the name of their detestation. It is with reference to this that it is written, <i>he hath ‘given’ his seed unto Molech</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">331</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:3.</i> similar to what is done within the Sanctuary precincts, as it is written, <i>and he shall give them unto the priest</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 15:14.</i> Perhaps the priests waved the child before the Molech, or brought it near the idol, and then they returned it to the hands of the father, and he took him and passed him through the open flame, this being the sense of the expression, <i>he that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:10.</i> And so the Rabbis have said in the Yerushalmi:<sup class="footnote-marker">333</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi Sanhedrin VII, 10. On “Yerushalmi,” see Note 44 in <i>Seder Metzora</i>.</i> “[The penalty of death] is never incurred [by the father] unless he delivers the child to the priests, and then he [the father] takes him and passes him through the fire,” that is to say, he takes the child from the priests, and he himself passes him through the fire. However, there was no actual burning of the child. For the Rabbis have said,<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i> “If one passed himself through the fire, he is not liable” [to death], which shows that the offender is alive even after he has passed through the fire. And so did Rashi explain [that there was no actual burning of the child].<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i><br>Yet notwithstanding all this, it appears to me on the basis of decisive verses that the child <i>was</i> actually consumed by the flames, for Scripture states, <i>and their sons, whom they bore unto Me, they have also made them pass through unto them ‘to be devoured,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">334</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 23:37.</i> and further on there it says, <i>and when they had slain their children to their idols</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">335</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 39.</i> meaning that they passed him through the fire until he was burnt or died in the fire, this being “the slaying” [mentioned in the verse], for the expression <i>they have made them pass through unto them</i> is a reference to the worship of Molech, and Scripture states <i>to be devoured</i> and also mentions the term slaying! If so, when the Rabbis said [with reference to the Molech that it was] “like a leaping place of Purim,”<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">“Like children leaping over a bonfire” (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>). The Talmudic text <i>k’mishvarto d’puria</i> is thus explained by Rashi “as a leaping place of Purim,” i.e., like a bonfire made on Purim for merriment, over which children leap. Ramban will later on explain that at the Molech the child was passed through the flames so many times that the flames actually burnt him.</i> they meant to say that they made the child pass through the flame many times, until he died in the burning fire. Thus by law of the Torah the father is liable to punishment from the moment of the child’s first passing through, as soon as the fire takes hold of him, such as where one of his limbs took fire. It is for this reason that the Rabbis had to say that he who passes himself through the fire is not liable, [since the liability to punishment begins at the moment when the fire takes hold of one of his limbs, when he is still alive]. But the fire actually consumed the victim, as this was their sacrifice to Molech. And the expression of <i>ma’avir ba’eish</i> [which until now we have understood as “passing through the fire”] always denotes “something burnt by fire, but not [totally] consumed thereby,” for they used to put [the victim] in the fire, and then remove the body from there, and not let it turn into ashes like burnt [sacrifices], similar to utensils of gentiles [which, in order to be purified from the forbidden food they have absorbed], are made white-hot in the flame, and it is said of them, <i>ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">336</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 31:23.</i> And it is said of the Ammonites, <i>and he made them pass through the brick-kiln</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">337</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 12:31.</i> meaning that he burnt them just as they do to bricks in a baking furnace. If so, <i>‘ma’avir’ his son or his daughter through the fire</i><sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:10.</i> means placing him in the fire so that it should take hold of him, not merely passing him through it. And this is the meaning of <i>ha’avarah</i> which is mentioned in connection with the Molech, which was by fire according to the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i> who derived it by means of a similarity of the term <i>ha’avarah</i> [“passing through,” mentioned here in the verse before us, and in Deuteronomy 18:10]: “just as there the ‘passing through’ is in fire [as it is said, <i>There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter ‘pass through the fire’</i>], so here too the meaning is through the fire [although it is not clearly stated], and just as here it is to the Molech, so there too it is to Molech.” Proof to the words of the Rabbis [that the meaning of this ‘passing through’ mentioned here was by fire], is that which is written of King Josiah, <i>And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">338</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 23:10.</i> Thus the term <i>ha’avarah</i> (‘passing through’) mentioned here in connection with Molech means by fire. So also is it written of King Manasseh: <i>He also made his children ‘to pass through the fire’ in the valley of the son of Hinnom</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">339</sup><i class="footnote">II Chronicles 33:6.</i> And I have found it written of King Ahaz, <i>And he also made his son ‘to pass through the fire,’ according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Eternal cast out from before the children of Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">340</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 16:3.</i> and in the Book of Chronicles it is stated [of the same king], <i>and ‘he burnt’ his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Eternal cast out</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">341</sup><i class="footnote">II Chronicles 28:3.</i> If so, <i>ha’avarah</i> (the ‘passing through’) in fact was a burning with real fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">342</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban is thus suggesting that the word <i>ha’avarah</i> (“passing through”) was really an <i>hav’arah</i> (an actual burning of fire), since the verse in Kings speaking of King Ahaz uses the term <i>ha’avarah</i>, while the verse in Chronicles describing the same acts of the same king uses the term <i>hav’arah</i>. Thus it is clear that the two words are identical in meaning in this context.</i><br>Now that which Scripture states, <i>and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 17:31.</i> [and it does not mention Molech], that was another idol, which was worshipped by burning the victims <i>completely</i> as a sacrifice [which was burnt to ashes]. They used to worship the Baal in a similar manner, as it is written of Jeremiah, <i>Go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">344</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 19:2.</i> and there it says further, <i>and they have filled this place with the blood of innocents; and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire ‘for burnt-offerings’ unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My mind</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> And it is further written, <i>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to make their sons and their daughters pass through unto Molech; which I commanded not, neither came it into My mind, that they should do this abomination</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">346</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:35.</i> However, due to the fact that these two [last mentioned] verses speak of <i>the high places of Baal</i>, both being in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and the admonition in connection with both of them is identical: <i>which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My mind</i>, and the Molech was [also] there in that impure place, as it is written in connection with King Josiah,<sup class="footnote-marker">347</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And he defiled Topheth which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech</i> (II Kings 23:10). The verse was mentioned above by Ramban (see text at Note 338).</i> it would appear from all this that they used to burn their children as sacrifices to Molech, which was the Baal, both names being closely associated, and meaning royalty and lordship. This is not the Baal of Peor<sup class="footnote-marker">348</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 25:3.</i> or Baal-zebub,<sup class="footnote-marker">349</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 1:2.</i> for this one [referred to by Jeremiah] was called Baal without any qualification, as Molech was so called, [without any qualification]. Scripture mentions in connection with the worship thereof the term <i>ha’avarah</i> (passing through),<sup class="footnote-marker">346</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:35.</i> because the main act of worship was by passing the children through [the two pyres] until the fire took hold of them, and it calls it “burning”<sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> because they would die there. That is why they are called “burnt-offerings” [as it is said, <i>to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> Similarly, I am of the opinion that <i>the gods of Sepharvaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 17:31.</i> are also identified with Molech, for their surnames [Adrammelech and Anammelech]<sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 17:31.</i> denote kingship [as the word <i>melech</i> indicates]. Both of them were worshipped in the same way, although one was called Adra,<sup class="footnote-marker">350</sup><i class="footnote">In Sanhedrin 63 b the Talmud explains the word to mean “the mule.” The word <i>adar</i> in Aramaic means “distinction,” and the mule is so called because it gives distinction to its owner when travelling, because it carries all his belongings. The name Adrammelech thus means “The mule is the king,” or “the animal which gives distinction to the king.” See II Samuel 13:29, that the mule was ridden by princes, and I Kings 1:33 that it was ridden by the king. Ramban in explaining Adrammelech to be identical with Molech, thus suggests that the Sepharvites called their idol Adar, a name meaning “distinction,” and Adrammelech is “the king of distinction.”</i> which is an expression of respect, and the second was called Ana which is of the root <i>oneh</i> (answers),<sup class="footnote-marker">351</sup><i class="footnote">This term according to the Talmud (Sanhedrin <i>ibid.</i>) is a reference to the horse because it “answers” its master when engaged in battle. See my Hebrew commentary p. 107, Note 44. The name Anammelech means “The horse is the king,” or “the animal which answers the king” in battle. Ramban here suggests, then, that Molech was called Anammelech because “he is the king who answers.”</i> and the name “melech” was attached to both, which is like Molech. The “burning” mentioned in connection with them<sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 17:31.</i> was the death of the victims by fire, as I have explained [above]. But if we were to say that these detestations [Adrammelech and Anammelech] were not the Molech, then it is possible that because they were worshipped by means of sons and daughters being brought to them in fire, in a similar manner to that which it says about the Molech, therefore their names [Adra and Ana] were combined with his name, and form a <i>melech</i> (king) or Baal, but the modes of worship were not the same. For the Molech was worshipped with “passing through” [the fire], and the gods of Sepharvaim with burning,<sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 17:31.</i> and the Baal with slaughtering first and then burning, like burnt-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> And it is further said [in Jeremiah] that in the place of the <i>Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom</i><sup class="footnote-marker">338</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 23:10.</i> there were also high places to Baal [as mentioned in connection with King Josiah, that he defiled that place so <i>that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</i>], and it also mentions there the Molech [and Molech and Baal were to some extent identical, as stated above]. Thus that which Scripture states, <i>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to make their sons and their daughters to pass through unto Molech</i><sup class="footnote-marker">346</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:35.</i> [which would seem to indicate that Molech and Baal are <i>entirely</i> identical, contrary to what we have said above], really means: “and” <i>to make their sons and their daughters pass through</i> [the fire] <i>unto Molech</i>.<br>Now our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">352</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 63 b.</i> “The father of Hezekiah king of Judah too [i.e., Ahaz] wanted to do so to him [in his infancy], and to burn him in the fire, but his mother saved him from death by rubbing him with the oil of<sup class="footnote-marker">353</sup><i class="footnote">“With the oil of” — this phrase is not mentioned in the Gemara.

The fact that all these practices are mentioned together proves that the rite of “passing through the fire” was also some form of witchcraft, while the actual burning of the victim was an entirely different matter, since that was a form of idol worship to Molech. All this we would say according to the plain meaning of Scripture. But see further, Note 359.</i> And in the case of King Manasseh Scripture likewise states, <i>He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised soothsaying, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">357</sup><i class="footnote">II Chronicles 33:6. Here too the same reasoning as in the previous note applies.</i> and it is further written, <i>and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">358</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 17:17. Here likewise it would seem that “passing through the fire” was a form of witchcraft, something different from the worship of Molech. But see the following note.</i> [these verses indicating that the rite of “passing through the fire” was some form of witchcraft], and the Molech was an idol to which they offered little children.<sup class="footnote-marker">359</sup><i class="footnote">Accordingly, in line with the plain meaning of Scripture we would say that the rite of “passing through the fire” was something different from the burning of the victim to Molech. But since we have found it written etc. (see text).</i> But since we have found it written, <i>that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech</i><sup class="footnote-marker">360</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 23:10.</i> [which shows clearly that “passing through the fire” was in connection with the worship of Molech], the words of our Rabbis that all forms of worshipping Molech were by fire, have been shown to be trustworthy. But it is [also] possible [as the verses indicate] that they used this rite for false divination and to prophesy by means of it, according to their foolishness, these being the prophets of Baal who would first offer to him sacrifices of children, and then have vain dreams and <i>a lying divination</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">361</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 13:7.</i> Therefore the Torah associates the matter of the Molech with that of [the various kinds of] divination. For here [in the Book of Leviticus] it placed [the subject of the Molech] immediately before <i>the soul that turneth unto the ghosts, and unto the familiar spirits</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">362</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:6.</i> and in the Book of Deuteronomy<sup class="footnote-marker">363</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:9-14.</i> the whole section is devoted to the subject of those who predict the future falsely.<br>Now Scripture [here in the verse before us] states that the act of passing children through the fire to Molech constitutes a profaning of G-d’s Name,<sup class="footnote-marker">364</sup><i class="footnote">The verse here concludes, <i>Neither shalt thou profane the Name of thy G-d</i>.</i> and in the other section [i.e., in <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>] it adds, <i>to defile My Sanctuary, and to profane My Holy Name</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:3.</i> Perhaps the meaning thereof is as follows: [To give of one’s children to Molech is] “<i>to defile</i> the people that is sanctified to My Name, whom I commanded, <i>Sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy, for I the Eternal, Who sanctify you, am holy;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">366</sup><i class="footnote">This is a combination of two verses, Above, 11:44 and further, 21:8.</i> — <i>And to profane My holy Name</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:3.</i> when they commit this serious sin before Me.” For thus He speaks of the serious sins, such as, <i>and a man and his father go unto the same maid, to profane My holy Name</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">367</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 2:7.</i> It is possible that He says so [<i>to defile My Sanctuary</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:3.</i> in connection with the Molech], because a father who sacrifices of his seed to Molech and afterwards comes into G-d’s Sanctuary to bring an offering, defiles the Sanctuary, as his offerings are defiled and are an abomination to G-d, and he himself is forever defiled, having become impure by the evil he did; just as He said of [those who turn to] the ghosts and the familiar spirits, <i>seek them not out, to be defiled by them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">368</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 19:31.</i> and it is further written, <i>and because they had defiled it with their idols</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">369</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 36:18.</i> And He also mentions [in connection with the Molech] the profaning of G-d’s Name [as it says, <i>and to profane My holy Name</i><sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:3.</i>], because when the nations hear that he honored the Molech with his seed, and to G-d he brought an offering of his cattle, it will be a profaning of G-d’s Name. It is concerning this that the prophet Ezekiel said, <i>and their sons, whom they bore unto Me, they have also made them pass through unto them to be devoured. Moreover this they have done unto Me: they have defiled My Sanctuary in the same day</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">370</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:37-38.</i> And the prophet continues, <i>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into My Sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of My house</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">371</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 39.</i><br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], Israel <i>the holy seed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">372</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:13.</i> is born in the house of G-d, this being the meaning of the expression <i>whom they bore unto Me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">373</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 23:37.</i> Thus he who sacrifices one of G-d’s people to the Molech, defiles G-d’s Sanctuary and profanes His Great Name, similar to the expression, <i>And he</i> [i.e., the High Priest] <i>shall not profane his seed among his people</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">374</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:15.</i> It is for this reason that He said [of the person who gives of his seed to Molech], <i>And I will set My face against that man</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">375</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 20:3.</i> [and again], <i>Then will I set My face against that man</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">376</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> The student learned in the mystic lore of the Cabala will understand.

Verse 22

Now the reason for the prohibitions against lying carnally with a male,<sup class="footnote-marker">377</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> or an animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">378</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> is well-known, as it is an abominable act and is not for the preservation of the human species, because [the copulation] of [male and male or of] man and animal will not beget offspring. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented:<sup class="footnote-marker">377</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> “Since we find [Lot’s daughter using] the expression, <i>Behold, ‘shachavti’</i> (<i>I lay</i>) <i>yesternight with my father</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 19:34.</i> [and she did not say, <i>nishkavti</i>, in the passive, or “Behold, <i>shachav imi avi</i>, — my father lay with me,” this shows that the term <i>shachav</i>, although in the active form, refers to the person who commits that act as well as the passive partner who permits herself or himself to be thus abused]; thus it follows that the verse, <i>And with a male ‘lo thishkav’</i> (<i>thou shalt not lie</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">377</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> constitutes a prohibition both against the one who actively commits pederasty, and against the one who permits himself to be thus abused.” [Thus far are the words of Ibn Ezra.] But if it be as Ibn Ezra said, why is the woman not included in the verse, <i>And thou shalt not lie with any beast</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">378</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> [and it is clear that she is not so included from the fact that Scripture had to continue, <i>Neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">378</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23.</i> for women are included in all admonitions of the Torah? Rather, the use of the expression, <i>Behold, ‘shachavti’</i> (<i>I lay</i>) <i>yesternight with my father</i><sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 19:34.</i> is due to the fact that it was Lot’s daughters who, through lying with him, [were instrumental in that affair] in order to beget seed of him. As is known, the seed comes either from the movement of the whole body, just as foam is formed in the mouths of galloping horses, or it is brought forth in the veins nearby [the sexual organ], where it gathers by the continuing motion thereof until it is emitted. Were they then not to have lain with Lot, his seed would not have come forth, for in his drunkenness he was like a silent stone.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

AND THE LAND WAS DEFILED, THEREFORE DID I VISIT THE INIQUITY THEREOF UPON IT, AND THE LAND VOMITED OUT HER INHABITANTS. Scripture was very strict in forbidding these sexual relationships on account of the Land which becomes defiled by them, and which in turn will vomit out the people that do [these abominations]. Now forbidden sexual relationships are matters affecting personal conduct, and do not depend on the Land, [so why should the Land be affected by these personal immoral acts]? But the secret of the matter is in the verse which states, <i>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the children of men, He set the borders of the people</i>, etc. <i>For the portion of the Eternal is His people</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">380</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:8-9.</i> The meaning thereof is as follows: <i>The Glorious Name</i><sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:58.</i> created everything and He placed the power of the lower creatures in the higher beings, giving over each and every nation <i>in their lands, after their nations</i><sup class="footnote-marker">382</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 10:31.</i> some known star or constellation, as is known by means of astrological speculation. It is with reference to this that it is said, <i>which the Eternal thy G-d hath allotted unto all the people</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">383</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:19.</i> for He allotted to all nations constellations in the heavens, and higher above them are the angels of the Supreme One whom He placed as lords over them, as it is written, <i>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">384</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 10:13.</i> and it is written, <i>lo, the prince of Greece shall come</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">385</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> They are called “kings,” as it is written [there], <i>and I was left over there beside the kings of Persia</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">384</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 10:13.</i> Now <i>the Glorious Name</i><sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:58.</i> is <i>G-d of gods, and Lord of lords</i><sup class="footnote-marker">386</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 10:17.</i> over the whole world. But the Land of Israel, which is in the middle of the inhabited earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">387</sup><i class="footnote">Aware of the fact that the earth is spherical [and not flat, as believed by most people in the Medieval Ages], Jewish sources being mindful of this fact speak of the Land of Israel as being in the middle of the “inhabited” earth, and not just “of the earth,” as there is no middle point in a spherical body.</i> is the inheritance of the Eternal designated to His Name. He has placed none of the angels as <i>chief, observer, or ruler</i><sup class="footnote-marker">388</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 6:7.</i> over it, since He gave it as a heritage to His people who declare the Unity of His Name, the seed of His beloved ones [i.e., the patriarchs]. It is with reference to this that He said, <i>and ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">389</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:5.</i> and it is further written, <i>so shall ye be My people, and I will be your G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 11:4.</i> and you will not be subject to other powers at all. Now He [also] sanctified the people who dwell in His Land with the sanctity of observing the laws against forbidden sexual relationships, and with the abundant commandments, so that they [His people] would be dedicated to His Name. It is for this reason that He said, <i>And ye shall keep all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them, that the Land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">391</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:22.</i> and it is further written, <i>But I have said unto you: ‘Ye shall inherit their Land, and I will give it unto you to possess it’ … I am the Eternal your G-d, Who have set you apart from the peoples</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">392</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> meaning to say, that He has set us apart from all the nations over whom He appointed princes and other celestial powers, by giving us the Land [of Israel] so that He, blessed be He, will be our G-d, and we will be dedicated to His Name. Thus the Land which is the inheritance of the Glorious Name, will vomit out all those who defile it and will not tolerate worshippers of idols, nor those who practise immorality. Now this section mentioned the Molech,<sup class="footnote-marker">393</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 21.</i> which is a form of idolatry, together with the forbidden sexual relationships, and with reference to all of them He said, <i>Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all of these the nations are defiled</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">394</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> <i>and the Land vomited out her inhabitants</i><sup class="footnote-marker">395</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 25 before us.</i> [thus showing that the Land is unable to contain idol worshippers or those who practise immorality]. And so also did He say in the second section [i.e., in <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>], <i>and I have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">396</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:26.</i> which is [the basis for] the strict prohibition against idolatry. Therefore He stated that it is because they are dedicated to His Name that He gave them the Land, as it is said, <i>And I have said unto you: ‘Ye shall inherit their Land, and I will give it unto you to possess it’ … I am the Eternal your G-d, Who have set you apart from the peoples</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">392</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i><br>Now outside the Land of Israel, although it all belongs to <i>the Glorious Name</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:58.</i> yet its purity is not perfect, because of “the servants” who hold sway there, and the nations go astray after their princes to worship them as well. It is for this reason that Scripture states, <i>the G-d of the whole earth shall He be called</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">397</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 54:5.</i> since He is the G-d of gods Who rules over all, and He will in the end <i>punish the host of the high heaven on high</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">398</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:21.</i> removing the celestial powers and demolishing the array of “the servants,” and afterwards He will punish <i>the kings of the earth upon the earth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">398</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:21.</i> This is the meaning of the verse stating, <i>The matter is by the decree of ‘irin’</i> (<i>the wakeful ones</i>), <i>and ‘sh’elta’</i> (<i>the sentence</i>) <i>by the word of the holy ones</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">399</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 4:14.</i> meaning, the matter that was decreed on Nebuchadnezzar [that he be driven from men and eat grass as oxen etc.] is the pronouncement of the guarding angels and the sentence of the word of the holy ones, who have ordained on the powers emanating from them that it be so. They [the angels] are called <i>irin</i> [literally: “the wakeful ones”], because from their emanations proceed all the powers that stir all activities, similar to that which it says, <i>and behold ‘ir’</i> (<i>a wakeful one</i>) <i>and a holy one came down from heaven. He cried aloud, and said thus: ‘Hew down the tree</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">400</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10-11.</i> — [In the verse] <i>And ‘sh’elta’</i> (<i>the sentence</i>) <i>is by word of the holy ones</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">399</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 4:14.</i> [the word <i>sh’elta</i>] is like <i>sha’alu</i>, meaning first “they ask” what is the will of the Supreme One about it, and afterwards they decree that it be so done. It is with reference to this that Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar, <i>it is the decree of the Most High</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">401</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 21.</i> for everything is from Him, blessed be He.<br>Thus <i>the Glorious Name</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:58.</i> blessed be He, <i>is G-d of gods</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">386</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 10:17.</i> in the whole world, and G-d of the Land of Israel which is <i>the inheritance of the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">402</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 26:19.</i> This is the meaning of the expression, <i>and he will go astray after the foreign gods of the Land</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">403</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 31:16.</i> for the gods are foreign to the Land of G-d and His inheritance. This is what Scripture means when it states [of the Cutheans who were settled by the king of Assyria in the cities of the kingdom of Israel], <i>they knew not the manner of the G-d of the Land; therefore He hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the G-d of the Land</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">404</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 17:26. The verse is thus stating that they did not live in the Land in a way befitting its special characteristic as G-d’s inheritance — hence the phrase “the G-d of the Land.”</i> Now the Cutheans were not punished in their own land when they worshipped their gods, by G-d sending lions among them, but only when they came into the Land of G-d and conducted themselves as before, did He send lions among them who slew them. And so the Rabbis taught in the Sifra:<sup class="footnote-marker">405</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra <i>Kedoshim</i> 11:14.</i> “<i>And the Land vomit not you out also</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">406</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 28.</i> The Land of Israel is unlike other lands; it is unable to contain sinners.” And in the Sifre we find that the Rabbis taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">407</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre <i>Ha’azinu</i>, 315.</i> “<i>And there was no strange god with Him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">408</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:12.</i> [when He took Israel out of Egypt, and protected them during their wandering through the wilderness], so that none of the princes of the nations should have power to come and exercise authority over you, something like that which it is said, <i>and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come</i>, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">385</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> This is the meaning of the saying of the Rabbis:<sup class="footnote-marker">409</sup><i class="footnote">Kethuboth 110 b.</i> “Whoever lives outside the Land, is as if he had no G-d, for it is said, <i>I am the Eternal your G-d, Who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">410</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 25:38.</i> and it is further said, <i>for they have driven me</i> [David] <i>out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the Eternal, saying: Go, serve other gods</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">411</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 26:19. “And who told David, <i>‘Go, serve other gods?’</i> This can only mean to teach you that he who lives outside the Land is like etc.’” (Kethuboth). Having been forced to leave the Land, David was thus justified in saying that those responsible for it had, as it were, said to him, “Go, etc.”</i> And in the Tosephta of Tractate Abodah Zarah the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">412</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta, Abodah Zarah 5:5. On the name Tosephta, see in <i>Seder Tazria</i> Note 124.</i> “Now it is said, <i>And I</i> [Jacob] <i>will come back to my father’s house in peace, then shall the Eternal be my G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">413</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 28:21.</i> and it is further said, <i>to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">410</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 25:38.</i> When you are in the land of Canaan I am your G-d. When you are not in the land of Canaan, I am not your G-d if it were at all possible to say so [for He is our G-d under all circumstances and in all places]. Similarly it is said, <i>about forty thousand ready armed for war passed on in the presence of the Eternal unto battle</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">414</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 4:13.</i> and it is further said, <i>and the Land is subdued before the Eternal, and before His people</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">415</sup><i class="footnote">I Chronicles 22:18.</i> But how could it enter one’s mind that Israel subdued the Land before the Eternal [as if to say that they captured it for His sake]? But [this teaches that] as long as they are upon the Land, it is as if it were subdued [before Him, since He is their G-d, as explained above], but when they are not upon it, it is not subdued.”<br>It is on the basis of this matter that the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup class="footnote-marker">416</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre <i>Eikev</i>, 43.</i> “<i>And ye perish quickly from off the good Land</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">417</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 11:17. The following verse continues: <i>And ye shall lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul</i> etc. This clearly indicates even as the Sifre teaches, that after banishment from the Land they are to continue the observance of the commandments.</i> Although I banish you from the Land to outside the Land, make yourselves distinctive by the commandments, so that when you return they shall not be novelties to you. This can be compared to a master who was angry with his wife, and sent her back to her father’s house and told her, ‘Adorn yourself with precious things, so that when you come back they will not be novelties to you.’ And so did the prophet Jeremiah say [to the people in exile in Babylon], <i>Set thee up waymarks</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">418</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 31:20.</i> These are the commandments, by which Israel is made distinctive.” Now the verses which state, <i>and ye perish quickly … and ye shall lay up these My words</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">419</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 11:17-18.</i> only make obligatory in the exile [the observance of those commandments] affecting personal conduct, such as the [wearing of] phylacteries and [placing of] <i>Mezuzoth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">420</sup><i class="footnote">A parchment on which is written Deuteronomy 6:4-9, and 11:13-21, and which is fastened to the right door-post. See further in Vol. II, p. 173.</i> [these being specifically mentioned there in the following words of Scripture], and concerning them the Rabbis [in the above text of the Sifre] explained [that we must observe them] so that they shall not be novelties to us when we return to the Land, for the main [fulfillment] of the commandments is [to be kept] when dwelling in the Land of G-d. Therefore the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup class="footnote-marker">421</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre <i>R’eih</i>, 80.</i> “<i>And ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. And ye shall observe to do all the statutes</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">422</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 11:31-32.</i> Dwelling in the Land of Israel is of equal importance to all the commandments of the Torah.” A similar statement is also found in the Tosephta of Tractate Abodah Zarah.<sup class="footnote-marker">423</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta, Abodah Zarah 5:3.</i> This in fact was the thought of the wicked ones who [misusing the intention of the above statement], said to the prophet Ezekiel [whose prophetic activity was in the Babylonian exile]:<sup class="footnote-marker">424</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 105 a.</i> “Our master Ezekiel, if a servant is sold by his master, does the master still have any claim to him?”<sup class="footnote-marker">425</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, “since G-d sold them to Nebuchadnezzar and banished them from before Him, does He still have any claim upon them?” (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>). The answer was that they were never “sold” since the exile was merely a form of temporary punishment for their sins, and therefore, <i>and that which cometh into your mind</i> etc. (see text).</i> For it is said, <i>and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all; in that ye say: We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">426</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 20:32.</i> And this was the command of our patriarch Jacob <i>to his household, and to all that were with him</i>, at the time that they came into the Land, <i>Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">427</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 35:2.</i> And G-d, <i>by Whom</i> alone <i>actions are weighed</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">428</sup><i class="footnote">See I Samuel 2:3.</i> [brought it about] that Rachel died on the way when they started coming into the Land,<sup class="footnote-marker">429</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 35:16-19. See in Vol. I, pp. 330-332, where Ramban refers briefly to this problem, namely why Jacob married two sisters in their lifetime, and then concludes that “he married them only outside the Land.” Here Ramban completes the thought, by explaining that G-d, by Whom events are decided, therefore brought about the death of one of the sisters as soon as they came into the Land. The reason why Rachel had to die and not Leah, is explained in the text.</i> for on account of her own merit she did not die outside the Land, and for Jacob’s merit, he could not dwell in the Land with two sisters [in their lifetime, since this is forbidden in the Torah, and the laws of the Torah were observed by our ancestors in the Land of Israel even before the Torah was given on Sinai], and she [Rachel] was the one by whose marriage the prohibition against two sisters took effect [since Jacob was already married to Leah]. It would appear that Rachel became pregnant with Benjamin before they came to Shechem, and while in the Land Jacob did not touch her at all, for the reason that we have mentioned. And the prophet states, <i>And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have profaned My Land; they have filled Mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable things and their abominations</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">430</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 16:18.</i> This matter [i.e., that the Land of Israel is the inheritance of the Eternal and thus cannot tolerate sinners] is found in many places in the Scriptures, and you will see it clearly after I have opened your eyes to it.<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented in the section of <i>Vayeilech:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">431</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 31:16.</i> “We know that G-d is One, and changes arise because of those who receive [His beneficent deeds], but G-d does not change His deeds, as they are all done in wisdom. And included in the worship of G-d is to guard the ability to receive [His beneficence] according to the place [so that if a particular place is holier than others, one must observe there more strictly the laws of holiness]. Therefore it is written [of the Cutheans, that they did not know] <i>the manner of the G-d of the Land</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">432</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 17:26. The Cutheans were thus punished for not being heedful of the holiness of the Land of Israel which is unable to retain worshippers of idols.</i> and of Jacob it is said [when he came into the Land he told his household], <i>put away the strange gods</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">427</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 35:2.</i> and the extreme opposite of [the sanctity of] the place [i.e., the Land of Israel] is indulging in forbidden sexual relationships, as they are [sins of the] flesh. The student versed [in the mysteries of the Torah] will understand.” Thus are the words [of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra] of blessed memory.<br>Now do not refute me [in what I have written above, that Israel is under the direct guidance of G-d alone, and no celestial power determines their fate], by citing the verse, <i>Michael your prince</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">433</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 10:21.</i> for he is only a ministering angel who implores mercy for Israel, but is in no way a prince exercising any royalty or power. So was also <i>the captain of the host</i><sup class="footnote-marker">434</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 5:14.</i> who appeared to Joshua at Jericho, showing him that G-d had sent him to fight their battles, similar to [that which happened in the days of] Hezekiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">435</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 19:35: <i>And it came to pass at that night, that the angel of the Eternal went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians</i> etc.</i> Besides, this matter [of Michael imploring mercy for Israel] was when we were already outside the Land of Israel.<br>Now I do not have permission to explain on the subject of <i>ha’aretz</i> (“the earth” or “the Land”) more than this.<sup class="footnote-marker">436</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban is alluding to the word <i>ha’aretz</i>, which is mentioned here repeatedly: <i>vatitma ha’aretz … vataki ha’aretz</i> (literally: “and the earth was defiled … and the earth vomited out”). This hints at the first <i>ha’aretz</i>, mentioned in the first verse of Creation, which Ramban has already explained in many places as referring to “the higher earth,” to which the souls finally return after their sojourn on the lower earth.</i> But if you will merit to understand the first “earth” mentioned in the verse of <i>Bereshith</i> (<i>In the beginning G-d created the heaven and the earth</i>), and also the one mentioned in the section of <i>Im Bechukothai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">437</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:42. <i>v’ha’aretz ezkor</i> (literally: “and the earth I will remember”).</i> you will know a profound and sublime secret, and you will further understand what our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">438</sup><i class="footnote">Tanchuma, <i>Vayakheil</i> 7.</i> “The Sanctuary on high is exactly opposite the Sanctuary below.” I have already alluded to this on the verse, <i>for all the earth is Mine</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">439</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:5.</i> Now Scripture mentions that the people of the land of Canaan were punished on account of their immoral [sexual] deeds. And our Rabbis have said that they were warned about these matters from the time of creation, when these laws were declared to Adam<sup class="footnote-marker">440</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 56 b. Rambam in the Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Melachim</i> 9:1, puts it as follows: “The first man was commanded concerning six matters: idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, incest, robbery, etc.”</i> and to Noah,<sup class="footnote-marker">441</sup><i class="footnote">Incest is counted among the Seven Laws of the Noachides (see Vol. I, p. 417, Note 148).</i> for He does not punish unless He admonishes first. Scripture, however, did not state the admonition, but instead said that the Land would vomit them out, for the Land abhors <i>all these abominations</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">442</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 27.</i> Now the Canaanites were not the only ones who were admonished about these matters [for since these laws were declared to Adam and Noah, they applied to all mankind], and the Scriptural section mentions specifically, <i>After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">443</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 3.</i> which proves that the Egyptians also did all these abominations, and yet the land of Egypt did not vomit them out, nor did the lands of other nations vomit them out! Rather, this whole subject shows the distinction of the Land [of Israel] and its holiness [so that it alone is unable to retain sinners]. Scripture states, <i>and the Land vomited out</i> [using a past tense, although the Canaanites were still living there], for from the time that He was to punish [them] for the sins committed upon her [i.e. the Land], having decreed destruction upon the Canaanites, it is as if the Land had already vomited them out. Or it may be that the expression, <i>and the Land vomited out</i> is a reference to above, similar to what is said, <i>their defense is removed from over them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">444</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 14:9.

Verse 29

AND THE SOULS THAT DO THEM SHALL BE CUT OFF FROM AMONG THEIR PEOPLE. “His offspring is cut off, and his [own] days are shortened.” This is Rashi’s language.<sup class="footnote-marker">445</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 17:9.</i> Now in the matters of excision mentioned in the Torah there are three different expressions. One is that which states, <i>that man shall be cut off;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">446</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4 and 9. This form of expression is found in connection with slaughtering or bringing offerings outside the Sanctuary Court.</i> a second one is that which says, <i>and the souls which do them shall be cut off</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">447</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 29 before us, in connection with forbidden sexual relationships.</i> or <i>that soul shall be cut off from before Me;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">448</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:3 in connection with eating of the holy offerings in a state of impurity. It is also found as a punishment for eating forbidden fat (above, 7:25), blood (<i>ibid.</i>, 17:10) etc.</i> and a third form of expression is that which states, <i>that soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">449</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:31. In connection with idol worship and blasphemy.</i> Now of a [a person doing work on] the Day of Atonement Scripture states, <i>that soul will I destroy from among his people</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">450</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:30.</i> and on this the Rabbis commented in the Sifra:<sup class="footnote-marker">451</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra. <i>Emor</i> 14:4.</i> “Excision is mentioned in many places in Scripture. But I do not know what it is. Now that it says, <i>and I will destroy</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">450</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:30.</i> it teaches that excision means ‘destruction’ [of the soul].”<br>The explanation of the subject is as follows. If someone eats forbidden fat or blood and he is [still] a righteous person whose merits outweigh [his sins], but he could not control his desire for it, and thus stumbled in this sin, his days will be shortened and he will die in his youth before reaching old age, which is sixty years,<sup class="footnote-marker">452</sup><i class="footnote">“At sixty a man attains old age” (Aboth 5:24).</i> but his soul is not destined for destruction;<sup class="footnote-marker">453</sup><i class="footnote">For although in the case of eating forbidden fat or blood Scripture does state <i>that soul shall be cut off</i> (see Note 448 above), yet since the merits of this man outweigh his sins, his soul will not be destroyed. In other words, the punishment of destruction of the soul applies only if his sins outweigh his merits, as a result of his having eaten forbidden fat or blood, as explained further on in the text.</i> rather, its portion will be in the World of Souls<sup class="footnote-marker">454</sup><i class="footnote">See in Vol. II, p. 65, Note 12.</i> in accordance with the person’s good deeds, since he was a righteous man, and he will also have a portion in the World to Come, which is the world after the resurrection. Of this case it is said, <i>that man shall be cut off</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">446</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4 and 9. This form of expression is found in connection with slaughtering or bringing offerings outside the Sanctuary Court.</i> But [in the case of] one who, as a result of this grave sin, now has more sins [in gravity] than his merits, the punishment of excision for this weighty transgression affects the soul that sins after it is separated from the body, and it is cut off from life in the World of Souls.<sup class="footnote-marker">454</sup><i class="footnote">See in Vol. II, p. 65, Note 12.</i> It is with reference to those liable to this form of excision that Scripture alludes, in saying, <i>that soul shall be cut off from before Me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">448</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:3 in connection with eating of the holy offerings in a state of impurity. It is also found as a punishment for eating forbidden fat (above, 7:25), blood (<i>ibid.</i>, 17:10) etc.</i> And it is further written [in this connection], <i>that soul will I destroy from among his people</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">450</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:30.</i> These sinners do not suffer bodily excision [as is the case in the first type mentioned above], but may sometimes live to reach many days, even old age and hoary heads, as it is written, <i>and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">455</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 7:15.</i> It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">456</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 17 a.</i> “But he whose sins outweigh his merits, including a non-Jew<sup class="footnote-marker">457</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>A Jew</i> who sins with his body” is also mentioned there in the Talmud in this connection. But that is defined there as “the head (of him) that puts on no <i>Tefilin</i> (phylactery).” It may be that Ramban omitted mentioning this here, since his essential intention is to explain the types of excision mentioned in Scripture, which fit in with the example mentioned further on in the text, since the punishment for immorality is expressly stated even for the Canaanites.</i> who sins with his body — and Rav Papa said that this refers to a particular sin, that is to say, one who commits incest with one of the forbidden relations — these descend to Gehenna and they are punished for twelve months; after twelve months their bodies are destroyed, and their souls burnt, and the winds scatter [their ashes] under the soles of the feet of the righteous etc.” And there is a still more stringent form of excision, where both the body is cut off [from life in this world] and the soul [even from life in the World to Come]. It is of this [third kind of excision mentioned above] that it is said, <i>Because he hath despised the word of the Eternal, and hath broken His commandment, that soul ‘hikareith tikareith’</i> (<i>shall be utterly cut off</i>), <i>his iniquity shall be upon him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">449</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:31. In connection with idol worship and blasphemy.</i> And the Rabbis interpreted it:<sup class="footnote-marker">458</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 13 a.</i> “<i>‘Hikareith’</i> (<i>he shall be cut off</i>) in this world; <i>‘tikareith’</i> (<i>he shall be cut off</i>) in the World to Come,” meaning to say that he shall die in his youth, and his <i>life shall be as that of the depraved</i><sup class="footnote-marker">459</sup><i class="footnote">Job 36:14.</i> in that his soul will not share in the life after the resurrection and he will have no portion in the World to Come. This double expression of excision is not stated in the Torah except in matters of idolatry and blasphemy. Our Rabbis have further interpreted in Tractate Shebuoth:<sup class="footnote-marker">458</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 13 a.</i> “<i>Because he hath despised the word of the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">449</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:31. In connection with idol worship and blasphemy.</i> This refers to one who throws off the yoke, [i.e., he denies the essential principle of the religion], and perverts the sense of the Torah. <i>And he hath broken His commandment</i>. This is one who breaks the covenant of the flesh” [i.e., circumcision]. But this does not apply to all cases where excision is mentioned, it being explained there in the Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">458</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 13 a.</i> that the double expression of <i>‘hikareith tikareith’</i> (<i>he shall utterly be cut off</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">449</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:31. In connection with idol worship and blasphemy.</i> does not apply to all other people who are liable to excision by law of the Torah, except for those derived by interpretation of this verse; since this verse refers to a blasphemer and a worshipper of idols, and the Rabbis added by interpretations, those who deny the essential principle [of G-d’s existence], and those hardened wicked ones [mentioned above]. This is similar to that which is said of them in the tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">460</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word is <i>kabalah</i>, and it is here used as a term referring to the books of the Scriptures which come after the Five Books of Moses, because they are words of “tradition” received from the prophets.</i> <i>for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">461</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 66:24.</i> These are the ones who are enumerated in the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">462</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 90 a.</i> and in the Beraitha:<sup class="footnote-marker">463</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta, Sanhedrin Chapter 13.</i> “And these are they that have no share in the World to Come.” And so also it appears, that not all those liable to excision are punishable by the death of their offspring, except for those where the word <i>aririm</i> (childless) is mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">464</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 20:20-21.</i> And it is possible that all forbidden [sexual] relationships have been likened to each other [in this respect of the punishment, namely death of the offspring], but in the case of other sins for which excision is incurred, such as for eating forbidden fat and blood, we do not have [this aspect of punishment].<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented:<sup class="footnote-marker">465</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:30.</i> “There is a difference between <i>‘v’ha’avad’ti’</i> (<i>and I will destroy</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">450</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:30.</i> and <i>‘v’nichr’thah’</i> (<i>it shall be cut off</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">448</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:3 in connection with eating of the holy offerings in a state of impurity. It is also found as a punishment for eating forbidden fat (above, 7:25), blood (<i>ibid.</i>, 17:10) etc.</i> and I could not explain.” The learned scholar [Rabbi Abraham] thought that the soul that is “destroyed” is destroyed for ever, and the one that is “cut off” is denied life for a time, <i>and yet doth G-d not take away life</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">466</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 14:14.</i><br>Know and understand that the forms of excision mentioned with reference to the soul, constitute a great [source for] trust in the existence of souls after death, and the granting of reward in the World of Souls.<sup class="footnote-marker">454</sup><i class="footnote">See in Vol. II, p. 65, Note 12.</i> For in His saying, blessed be He, <i>and that soul shall be cut off from among his people</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">467</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:30.</i> <i>or that soul shall be cut off from before Me</i><sup class="footnote-marker">448</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:3 in connection with eating of the holy offerings in a state of impurity. It is also found as a punishment for eating forbidden fat (above, 7:25), blood (<i>ibid.</i>, 17:10) etc.</i> it denotes that <i>the soul that sinneth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">468</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 18:20.</i> shall be cut off in its iniquity, but other souls that did not sin, will exist before Him in the splendor on high. It is for this reason that He explains, <i>that soul … its iniquity shall be upon it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">469</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:31.</i> for it is the sin that is in it which will cause it to be cut off. And the meaning of the matter is that <i>the soul of man is the lamp of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">470</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 20:27.</i> which has been breathed into our nostrils<sup class="footnote-marker">471</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 2:7.</i> <i>out of the mouth of the Most High</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">472</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 3:38.</i> and <i>the spirit of G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">473</sup><i class="footnote">Job 33:4.</i> as it is said, <i>And He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">471</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 2:7.</i> and so it remains in its [original] state and does not die [with the death of the body], for it is not a composite [of the four elements] so that it be subject to the law of existence and decomposition, as are all components. But the existence of the soul is fitting [for all time], living forever as do the Separate Intelligences.<sup class="footnote-marker">474</sup><i class="footnote">Another name for “the angels.” See in Vol. II, p. 292, Note 313.</i> Therefore Scripture did not need to state that as a reward for [fulfillment of] the commandments the soul will exist [after the death of the body, for it is self-understood that it will exist from a knowledge of the nature of the soul], but instead it states that as a punishment for sins, the soul will be desecrated and defiled, and become cut off from its proper existence. This is the sense of the expression <i>kareth</i> (cutting off) which the Torah uses, intimating that it is like a branch cut off from the tree, from the roots of which it derives its nourishment. It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">475</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre <i>Shelach</i>, 112.</i> “<i>From among his people</i><sup class="footnote-marker">450</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 23:30.</i> — but his people are in peace.” For the cutting off of <i>the soul that sinneth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">468</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 18:20.</i> proves the existence of all other souls that do not sin, these being <i>his people</i> [mentioned in the verse] which are in peace. And we have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">476</sup><i class="footnote">At the beginning of <i>Seder Va’eira</i>.</i> that all assurances of the Torah, whether for reward or punishment, are all miraculous in nature, and are of the type of hidden miracles,<sup class="footnote-marker">477</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. I, p. 215, Note 372, and pp. 556-557.</i> the Torah always promising [certain blessings] in a non-natural manner [which result not from the processes of nature, but because of the observance of the law], and warning against [consequences which result not from the processes of nature, but as punishment for our violation of the law]. Therefore He warned here of <i>kareth</i> which is of a miraculous nature [since in the natural order of things the soul should exist forever], and did not promise the eternal existence of the soul [as a reward for observance of the commandments], since that is its natural state.<br>Now there are thirty-six sins<sup class="footnote-marker">478</sup><i class="footnote">Kerithoth 2 a.</i> for which the Torah prescribed excision as a punishment, many of them being in connection with prohibitions of forbidden sexual relationships, that is to say, forbidden sexual intercourse. Similarly, punishments of death imposed by the court for forbidden sexual intercourse, are sixteen.<sup class="footnote-marker">479</sup><i class="footnote">These are listed by Rambam in his Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Sanhedrin</i> 15:10-11.</i> But there is no death penalty at all for eating forbidden foods. The reason why these great punishments, such as death by the court and excision [by Heaven] are [imposed] for forbidden sexual relationships, is because immorality is something very abhorrent to the Torah, as is mentioned in this section and in many places of Scripture. The Sages always mention<sup class="footnote-marker">480</sup><i class="footnote">As in Aboth 5:11, Sanhedrin 74 a, etc.</i> “idolatry, immorality, and bloodshed” [as being the three gravest sins], mentioning immorality after idolatry and before bloodshed [thus showing the greatness of the sin, in that it is mentioned immediately after idolatry]. This is like that which the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">481</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 106 a.</i> “The G-d of these people [i.e., the Israelites] abhors lewdness.” There is also one of the great secrets of creation in this matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">482</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Verse 6.</i> And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim:<sup class="footnote-marker">483</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed III, 41. The quotation is not verbatim but expresses the gist of the thought.</i> “Because man’s temptation to sexual intercourse is great, and because of the strong [natural] desire for it, which can cause many stumblings, a great punishment was needed in order to discipline people.” This also is true.<br>Kedoshim

Chapter 19



Verse 1



Verse 2

SPEAK UNTO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Our Rabbis have already said<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim at beginning of <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>. Quoted also in Rashi.</i> that this section was addressed to the full assembly [of all Israel] because most of the fundamental principles of the Torah are dependent on it,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Mizrachi on Rashi offers two explanations of this text: (a) Since the laws of this chapter are so fundamental, it was necessary for all the congregation to be present, so that if a doubt arises in anyone’s mind as to precisely what Moses said, the other people can easily clarify it to him, which would not have been the case if the laws of this section were not declared to the full assembly. (b) Since these laws are so fundamental, men, women, and children were all present when Moses addressed them, whereas in the other sections of the Torah only the elders and the men were present.</i> this being the reason for the expression, <i>speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel</i>. This section, however, was mentioned here in [the book of] <i>Torath Kohanim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “the Law of the Priests,” which is another name for the Book of Vayikra, or Leviticus. In other words, since the laws of this section are so fundamental to the entire congregation of Israel, why were they placed in the book which is essentially devoted to the laws of the priests and the offerings? The answer follows in the text.</i> because it contains laws concerning the thanks-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Tur, quoting the language of Ramban, writes: “peace-offerings.” That is correct, since the following verses [5-8] refer only to the peace-offerings, and not the thanks-offering. There are important differences between them. A thanks-offering may be eaten only on the same day that it was slaughtered until midnight, whilst a peace-offering could be eaten for two days and the intervening night. Therefore Verses 6 and 7, speaking of permission to eat the offering for two days, could not possibly refer to the thanks-offering.</i> and also because it states the punishments<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Chapter 20.</i> He commanded us to execute on those who do the abominable deeds mentioned [in the preceding sections], as well as [those for] the forbidden sexual relationships. These subjects have been included in this book [of <i>Torath Kohanim</i>] for the reason that we have written at the beginning of this book.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban’s introduction to this book where he writes: “As a result of mentioning these laws, He warned afterwards about forbidden sexual relationships etc.”</i>
YE SHALL BE HOLY. “Abstain from the forbidden sexual relationships [mentioned in the preceding section] and from [other] sin,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">So explained in Gur Aryeh on Rashi.</i> because wherever you find [in the Torah] a warning to guard against immorality, you find the mention of ‘holiness.’” This is Rashi’s language. But in the Torath Kohanim I have seen it mentioned without any qualification [i.e., without any particular reference to immorality, as Rashi expressed it], saying:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, at beginning of <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>.</i> “Be self-restraining.” Similarly, the Rabbis taught there:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid., Shemini</i> 12:4.</i> “<i>And ye shall sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy, for I am Holy</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 11:44.</i> Just as I am Holy, so be you holy. Just as I am Pure, so be you pure.” And in my opinion, this abstinence does not refer only to restraint from acts of immorality, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, but it is rather the self-control mentioned throughout the Talmud, which confers upon those who practice it the name of <i>P’rushim</i> (Pharisees), [literally: “those who are separated” from self-indulgence, as will be explained, or those who practice self-restraint]. The meaning thereof is as follows: The Torah has admonished us against immorality and forbidden foods, but permitted sexual intercourse between man and his wife, and the eating of [certain] meat and wine. If so, a man of desire could consider this to be a permission to be passionately addicted to sexual intercourse with his wife or many wives, and be <i>among winebibbers, among gluttonous eaters of flesh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 23:20</i> and speak freely all profanities, since this prohibition has not been [expressly] mentioned in the Torah, and thus he will become a sordid person within the permissible realm of the Torah! Therefore, after having listed the matters which He prohibited altogether, Scripture followed them up by a general command that we practice moderation even in matters which are permitted, [such as in the following]: One should minimize sexual intercourse, similar to that which the Rabbis have said,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Berachoth 22 a.</i> “So that the disciples of the Sages should not be found together with their wives as often as the hens,” and he should not engage in it except as required in fulfillment of the commandment thereof. He should also sanctify himself [to self-restraint] by using wine in small amounts, just as Scripture calls a Nazirite “holy” [for abstaining from wine and strong drink],<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:8.</i> and he should remember the evils which the Torah mentioned as following from [drinking wine] in the cases of Noah<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 9:21.</i> and Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 19:33.</i> Similarly, he should keep himself away from impurity [in his ordinary daily activity], even though we have not been admonished against it in the Torah, similar to that which the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Chagigah 18 b.</i> “For the <i>P’rushim</i> (Pharisees), the clothes of the unlearned are considered as if trodden upon by a <i>zav</i>” [or <i>zavah</i> — a man or woman having suffered a flux], and just as the Nazirite is called “holy” because of guarding himself from the impurity of the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:6-7.</i> Likewise he should guard his mouth and tongue from being defiled by excessive food and by lewd talk, similar to what Scripture states, <i>and every mouth speaketh wantonness</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 9:16.</i> and he should purify himself in this respect until he reaches the degree known as [complete] “self-restraint,” as the Rabbis said concerning Rabbi Chiya,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See my Hebrew commentary p. 116, for different personalities to whom this character trait has been ascribed in Rabbinic sources. I have not found a clear source for Ramban’s version here.</i> that never in his life did he engage in unnecessary talk. It is with reference to these and similar matters that this general commandment [<i>Ye shall be holy</i>] is concerned, after He had enumerated all individual deeds which are strictly forbidden, so that cleanliness of hands and body, are also included in this precept, just like the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Berachoth 53 b.</i> “<i>And ye shall sanctify yourselves</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 11:44.</i> This refers to the washing of hands before meals. <i>And be ye holy</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 11:44.</i> This refers to the washing of hands after meals [before the reciting of grace]. <i>For I am holy</i> — this alludes to the spiced oil” [with which they used to rub their hands after a meal]. For although these [washings and perfuming of the hands] are commandments of Rabbinic origin, yet Scripture’s main intention is to warn us of such matters, that we should be [physically] clean and [ritually] pure, and separated from the common people who soil themselves with luxuries and unseemly things. And such is the way of the Torah, that after it lists certain specific prohibitions, it includes them all in a general precept. Thus after warning with detailed laws regarding all business dealings between people, such as not to steal or rob or to wrong<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 25:17.</i> one another, and other similar prohibitions, He said in general, <i>And thou shalt do that which is right and good</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:18.</i> thus including under a positive commandment the duty of doing that which is right and of agreeing to a compromise [when not to do so would be inequitable]; as well as all requirements to act “beyond” the line of justice [i.e., to be generous in not insisting upon one’s rights as defined by the strict letter of the law, but to agree to act “beyond” that line of the strict law] for the sake of pleasing one’s fellowman, as I will explain when I reach there [that verse], with the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. Similarly in the case of the Sabbath, He prohibited doing certain classes of work by means of a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:10.</i> and painstaking labors [not categorized as “work,” such as transferring heavy loads in one’s yard from one place to another, etc.] He included under a general positive commandment, as it is said, <i>but on the seventh day thou shalt rest</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:12.</i> I will yet explain this<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See further, 23:24.</i> with the help of G-d.
FOR I THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D AM HOLY. This means to say that we will merit to cleave unto Him by being holy. This expression [<i>I the Eternal your G-d</i>] is similar to that of the first commandment in the Ten Commandments [which begins, <i>I am the Eternal thy G-d</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:2.</i> He commanded here, <i>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> for there [in the Ten Commandments] He commanded that we honor them,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:12.</i> and here it is about fearing them. And he states here, <i>and ye shall keep My Sabbaths</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> for there [in the Ten Commandments] He commanded concerning remembering it,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8 (Vol. II, pp. 306-311).</i> and here about keeping it.

Verse 4

He states, <i>‘Al tiphnu’</i> (<i>Turn ye not</i>) <i>unto the idols</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> the term <i>tiphnu</i> (turn ye) being of the expressions: <i>and if thy heart ‘yiphneh’</i> (<i>turn away</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 30:17.</i> <i>whose heart ‘poneh’</i> (<i>turneth away</i>) <i>this day</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:17.</i> The verse [here] is thus stating that one’s heart should not turn away to the idols, to believe that there is some benefit in [worshipping] them, or that the events that they foretell will really transpire; rather, they and all their activities should appear to him <i>as things of nought, and vanity</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:17.</i> and future events occur only by decree of the Most High. And so also have our Rabbis said:<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 149 a.</i> “It is forbidden to look at the statues [of the idols] themselves, because it says, <i>‘Turn ye not’ unto the idols</i>.” Thus the Rabbis included within this prohibition even looking at the statues, so that one should not allow one’s thoughts to dwell on their matters at all.<br>He states, <i>nor make to yourselves molten gods</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> thus prohibiting them from the very moment that they are made. Admonitions against idolatry are stated in the Torah in many places.<br>In the Midrash of Vayikra Rabbah the Rabbis mentioned concerning this section [of the Torah the following text]:<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 24:5.</i> “Rabbi Levi says: Because the Ten Commandments are included in this section [therefore it was proclaimed to the full assembly]. <i>I am the Eternal thy G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:2.</i> and here it is written, <i>I am the Eternal your G-d.

Verse 5

He states, <i>And when ye offer an offering of peace-offerings unto the Eternal</i> etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> for after He prohibited the slaughtering of sacrifices, and all manner of worship to idols and to molten gods, and ordered that all Services be devoted to the Proper Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton] exclusively, He stated here that when you shall bring an offering to the Eternal, it shall be <i>lirtzonchem</i> [“of your desire”], in order that your worship should be acceptable to Him and that He should be pleased with you,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See Malachi 1:8.</i> even as a servant reconciles himself to his master<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See I Samuel 29:4.</i> by doing all that he commands him to do, the expression [<i>lirtzonchem</i>] being similar to: <i>‘v’nirtzah’</i> (<i>and it shall be accepted</i>) <i>for him to make atonement for him;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:4.</i> <i>but by the light of Thy countenance, because ‘retzitham’</i> (<i>Thou wast favorable unto them</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 44:4. <i>For not by their own sword did they get the Land in possession … but by Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance</i> …</i> And the meaning of the verse is to state that you are not to think that there is any benefit in idol worship, neither are you to do the service of <i>the Glorious Name</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:58.</i> in order to receive a reward, but only to do His Will, for it is His simple Will<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">For just as the Creator is a perfect Unity and in no way a composite of many elements, so when the Creator wills something, the Will is also simple as is His essence. Hence Ramban’s expression “His simple Will.”</i> that is proper and incumbent upon us [to do]. He states this with reference to the peace-offerings because they are of the lesser degree of holy offerings, which are eaten by the owners themselves [unlike the most holy offerings, such as the sin-offering, which may be eaten only by the priests, the verse thus saying] that the owners are to guard their thoughts, so that the offerings be brought with the proper intention, and this applies all the more so to the most holy offerings. Or it may be that [the verse here mentions peace-offerings] because peace-offerings are the [unique] attribute of Israel, just as our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 116 a. See in Vol. I, pp. 542-543.</i> “Noachides did not offer peace-offerings.” The student learned [in the mysteries of the Cabala] will understand. And our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 13 a.</i> “<i>Lirtzonchem</i> [literally: ‘to your intent’] slaughter the offering, meaning that you are to have the intention to slaughter it,” for if he merely “handles” an offering [i.e., if he does the act of slaughtering without the intention of so doing], he invalidates [the offering].

AND YE SHALL NOT SWEAR BY MY NAME FALSELY. “Why is this stated [when it has already been mentioned in the Ten Commandments]?

Verse 13



Verse 14

THOU SHALT NOT CURSE THE DEAF. “From this verse I know only [that one may not curse] the deaf. Whence do I know that one may not curse anybody? From the words of Scripture: <i>Of thy people thou shalt not curse</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:27.</i> If so, why does it state [here] ‘the deaf’? It is to teach us that ‘the deaf’ has been singled out by Scripture [here] because [although he is unable to hear and feel hurt], he has the characteristic of being alive, thus exluding [from the scope of this prohibition] the dead [who, though they are like the deaf in their inability to hear and feel hurt], are unlike them in being no longer alive.” This is Rashi’s language, and so it is taught in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 2:13.</i> But the interpretation of the Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 66 a.</i> is not so. Rather, Scripture first warned against [cursing] the dignitaries of the people, the judge or ruler, saying, <i>Thou shalt not curse ‘elohim’</i> (<i>the judges</i>) <i>nor curse a ruler of thy people</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:27.</i> Then it gave another admonition [here] against cursing the unfortunate ones of the people, like the deaf, and from them [i.e., from both classes of people, the distinguished and the unfortunate] we learn by a general proposition that we must not curse anyone of the rest of the people, since from beginning to end [from “the ruler” to “the deaf”] they are all included in this prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the prohibition against cursing anybody is not, as Rashi stated, derived from the phrase <i>of thy people thou shalt not curse</i>, but is rather based on the two prohibitions against cursing a ruler and the deaf, which include the highest stratum of the people as well as the unfortunate ones, and everyone else is naturally included in between these two categories.</i> And the word <i>b’amcha</i> (of thy people — <i>a ruler ‘of thy people’</i>) is interpreted [by the Gemara] to mean<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 85 a.</i> only those who conduct themselves in the manner <i>of thy people</i>, thus excluding the wicked.<br>According to the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse mentions cursing the deaf [in order that we may deduce] that if in the case of one who cannot hear and will not become incensed by the curse, the Torah nonetheless admonished against cursing him, how much more so [is it prohibited to curse] one who hears and feels the insult, and will become hot-tempered because of it! Moreover, Scripture always admonishes against doing that which is frequent, for a person is inclined to curse the deaf and put a stumbling-block before the blind since he does not fear them, because <i>they know not, neither do they understand</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 82:5.</i> Therefore [it states here], <i>and thou shalt fear thy G-d</i>, Who sees the secret things. And He added another prohibition against cursing rulers, the prince and the judge,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:27.</i> because it is usual for people to curse them in their bed-chamber<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See Ecclesiastes 10:20.</i> <i>when in judging him he lets him go forth condemned</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 109:7.</i> and there are many harms that are caused by cursing a prince or a judge, for the masses of people in their foolishness will hate them and will thus be stirred to rise up against them, while in truth the prince and judge establish the land by their justice.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See Proverbs 29:4: <i>The king by justice establisheth the land</i>.</i>

Verse 15



Verse 16

THOU SHALT NOT ‘THEILEICH RACHIL’ (GO UP AND DOWN AS A TALEBEARER) AMONG THY PEOPLE. “I say that because all those who sow discord [among brethren]<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See Proverbs 6:19.</i> and speak slander go into their friends’ houses in order to spy out what evil they can see or hear, so that they may tell it in the street — therefore they are called <i>holchei rachil</i> or <i>holchei regilah</i> (‘those who go about spying’) etc. And so did Onkelos translate [the verse before us]: <i>lo theichul kurtzin</i> [literally: ‘thou shalt not eat <i>kurtzin</i>’, which has the same meaning as], <i>‘va’achalu kartzeihon’</i> (<i>and they brought accusation against</i>) <i>the Jews;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 3:8.</i> ‘<i>achlu kurtza</i> (they slandered him) to the king.’<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Berachoth 58 a.</i> It appears to me that it was their custom to eat something in the house of him who accepted their slanderous words, this being a sort of final confirmation that the slanderer’s words are well-founded, and that he would stand by them. It was this snack that was called ‘the eating of <i>kurtzin</i>,’ [the word being associated with] the [Hebrew] expression, <i>‘koreitz’</i> (<i>he that winketh</i>) <i>with his eyes</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 6:13.</i> for such is the manner of all who go about slandering, to wink with their eyes, and to insinuate slanderous matters in order that [others who happen to] hear them should not understand them.” All this is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi].<br>But his explanation of this rendition of Onkelos has neither rhyme nor reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">See in Volume I, p. 100, for a similar remark.</i> For one who listens to a slanderer does not swear to him that he will believe his words, and [therefore the slanderer] need not give him a sign or token [to believe him]! Even when one slanders a servant to his master,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">See Proverbs 30:10: <i>Slander not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty</i>. Ramban’s intention is therefore as follows: Even in slandering a slave, where the slanderer runs the risk of incurring his curse, the master nonetheless gives the slanderer no assurance that he will listen to him, and so what sense is there to this “eating” on the part of the slanderer which Rashi mentioned?</i> the master does not assure him that he will listen to him, and so what sense is there to this “eating” [by the slanderer, as Rashi mentioned]? And Nebuchadnezzar did what he decided to do on the basis of his own decision about the righteous ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">This refers back to the proof Rashi mentioned above from the Book of Daniel 3:8, where it is said <i>‘va’achalu kartzeihon’ of the Jews</i>, and it is told that certain slanderers came and informed Nebuchadnezzar that Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were not bowing to his image of gold. As a result he called them and asked them if it was true. When they told him that they had no intention ever of bowing to his image of gold, he had them thrown into a burning furnace. But when they were saved by an act of G-d from the fiery furnace, the king had it proclaimed that no one must henceforth speak against the G-d of these righteous ones. — Ramban now points out that when accepting the words of the slanderers, we find no reference to the king’s offering them any food, a custom which Rashi mentioned as having been the basis for this expression <i>va’achalu kartzeihon</i>. Furthermore, as is evidenced from the story, he did not even believe them at first, for he called Hananiah etc. and asked about it. And yet Scripture says <i>‘va’achalu kartzeihon’ of the Jews</i>, which shows that this whole interpretation of Rashi in Onkelos’ translation of the verse is not borne out by Scripture.</i> and He did not offer food to the slanderers [to establish the veracity of their report], neither did he swear to them [that he would believe them], nor did he in fact believe them. Instead, he asked [of the righteous ones], <i>Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego</i> etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 3:14. Shadrach, Meshach, etc. were the Babylonian names that the chief of officers gave to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah (<i>ibid.</i>, 1:7).</i> and he commanded that if henceforth they were to bow to the image of gold that he had made, he would forgive them for their transgressions in the past! [All this shows that <i>va’achalu kartzeihon</i> does not refer to a meal eaten by the slanderers, to serve as the final confirmation that their slander was well-grounded, since in the case of Nebuchadnezzar, where this expression occurs, the king did not accept their report!] Nor did King Darius offer food to the slanderers of Daniel,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:12-14.</i> except for <i>the wormwood and the gall</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 3:19. In other words, he had the slanderers thrown into the lions’ den (Daniel 6:25.).</i> and yet it is written of them, <i>those men that ‘achalu kartzohi’ of Daniel!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, in the same verse where their punishment is mentioned (<i>ibid.</i>,) it refers to them as <i>those men that ‘achalu kartzohi’ of Daniel</i>, which shows that it was not a meal that the king offered them, but quite the contrary.</i> And even if it is true that it was so done in those [later] times, but since Scripture states <i>thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people</i>, why should Onkelos have mentioned this foolish custom [of the slanderer eating a little snack in the house of him who listened to his slanderous words], when it does not affect the admonition itself? Instead, the essential meaning of the Aramaic expression here [i.e., <i>lo theichul kurtzin</i>, is not a prohibition against “eating <i>kurtzin</i>,” but] is only a term for the act of making a sound, this usage being common in the language of the Sages:<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Bathra 5 a. The story there is told that Ravina had land on all four sides of a field belonging to a man called Runya. When Ravina put up a fence on all four sides separating his fields from that of Runya, the latter refused to pay his share of the expense. Thereupon Ravina at the time of the harvest said to his field laborer, “Bring me a cluster of grapes from Runya’s field when he is present there.” When he was about to do it Runya rebuked him, shouting, “Put it back.” Ravina then said to Runya: “Now you have shown that you are satisfied with the fence I have made. Even if only goats came into your field, would you not need to shout at them? Would you not need to hire a person to shout at them? [Hence you must share in the expense of the fence].”</i> “And even if it were but goats, would they not <i>achluyei michlulei</i> (have to be shouted at)? And would you not have [to hire] a person <i>l’achluyei</i> (to shout) at them?” Jonathan [ben Uziel] translated: <i>Cry aloud</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 58:1.</i> — <i>‘achlei;’ and ‘He will hiss’ unto them from the end of the earth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:26.</i> — <i>‘v’yachlilei;’ ‘and they shall roar’ against them like the roaring of the sea</i><sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:30.</i> — <i>‘v’yachlei’</i> against them. Similarly [Jonathan has translated] in many places. Thus the term <i>achal</i> [in Aramaic] denotes every form of making sound, whereby one makes his wish known without uttering words. Therefore this term was used [by the Sages, as mentioned above] to describe one who shouts at goats that enter a field, and [Jonathan used the same term in translating the Hebrew for] hissing,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:26.</i> roaring<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:30.</i> and crying aloud.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 58:1.</i> Now the way of talebearers is to come amongst a multitude of people, or before a ruler, and utter sounds in a guttural manner, and wink with their eyes, in order to hint that they have heard certain important matters until they press upon them that they tell them. This is why [talebearers in Aramaic] are called <i>ochlei kurtzin</i>, meaning “those who roar with hints.” And Onkelos who translated [the Hebrew] <i>rechiluth</i> (talebearing) [as <i>theichul kurtzin</i> — muttering hints], rendered into Aramaic the idea of the Hebrew, and was not particular to explain the precise meaning of the Scriptural expression. Such is always his style, since his intention is to make the subject understandable [and not necessarily to translate literally]. But in the Sacred Language talebearers are called <i>holchei rachil</i>, from the expressions, <i>all powders of the ‘rachil’</i> (<i>merchant</i>)<i>;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 3:6.</i> <i>‘rechulatheich’</i> (<i>thy merchandise</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 26:12.</i> For the <i>rocheil</i> (peddler) goes about the whole day, buying merchandise in various other places, just as the Sages mention,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Maasroth 2:3.</i> “peddlers that go around from town to town,” [and similarly the <i>holchei rachil</i> carry tales as if they were merchandise, from place to place]. And this is the sense of the word <i>b’amecha</i> (among thy people) — <i>Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer ‘among thy people’</i> — since the talebearer walks among many people. To differentiate between the two [the talebearer and the peddler], the talebearer was called <i>rocheil</i>, in a verbal form, [as the term <i>rocheil</i> can also signify the act of talebearing], while the peddler was called <i>rachil</i>, which is an adjectival noun denoting the person himself, just like <i>saris</i> (chief), <i>nazir</i> (a Nazirite), the name <i>rachil</i> thus hinting that peddling is of his essence, and is an act which reflects upon his person.

Because it is the way of those who hate a person to cover up their hatred in their hearts, just as it is said, <i>He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, but he layeth up deceit within him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 26:24.</i> therefore Scripture speaks of the usual events, [mentioning, <i>thou shalt not hate thy brother ‘in thy heart,’</i> but the law forbids all hating, even if done openly]. THOU SHALT SURELY REBUKE THY NEIGHBOR, This constitutes another commandment, that we must teach him reproof of instruction.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 6:23. <i>For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, and reproofs of instruction are a way of life</i>. See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 219-220.</i> THOU SHALT NOT BEAR SIN BECAUSE OF HIM, for you will bear sin because of his transgression if you do not rebuke him. Onkelos’ rendition tends towards this explanation, for he translated, “and do not receive guilt because of him,” meaning that you should not be punished by his sin. Following these commandments He then said [in the following verse] that you are to love your neighbor. Thus he who hates his neighbor violates a negative commandment, and he who loves him, fulfills a positive commandment.<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the expression <i>‘hochei’ach tochiach’</i> (<i>thou shalt surely rebuke</i>), is similar to <i>‘V’hochiach Avraham’</i> (<i>And Abraham reproved</i>) <i>Abimelech</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 21:25.</i> The verse here is thus stating: “do not hate your brother in your heart when he does something to you against your will, but instead you are to reprove him, saying, ‘Why did you do thus to me?’ and you will not bear sin because of him by covering up your hatred of him in your heart and not telling him, for when you will reprove him, he will justify himself before you [so that you will have no cause to hate him], or he will regret his action and admit his sin, and you will forgive him.” After that He admonishes [in the following verse] that you are not to take vengeance of him, nor bear a grudge in your heart against him because of what he has done to you, for it is possible that he will not hate him, but yet he will remember in his heart his neighbor’s sin against him; therefore He admonished him that he is to erase his brother’s sin and transgression against him from his heart. Following that admonition, He commanded that he love him as himself.

Verse 18

AND THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF. This is an expression by way of overstatement, for a human heart is not able to accept a command to love one’s neighbor as oneself. Moreover, Rabbi Akiba has already come and taught,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 62 a. This teaching applies to a case where “two people are together on a journey and one has a pitcher of water; if they both drink from it they will die, because there is not enough for both, but if only one will drink he will survive. Ben Petura taught that it is better that both should drink and die, rather than that one should see the death of the other. [This was held to be the law] until Rabbi Akiba came and taught: <i>that thy brother may live with thee</i> (further, 25:36), thy life takes precedence over the life of thy brother.”</i> “Your life takes precedence over the life of your fellow-being.” Rather, the commandment of the Torah means that one is to love one’s fellow-being in all matters, as one loves all good for oneself.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Thus: “he is to speak in praise of his neighbor, and be as careful of his neighbor’s property as he is careful of his own property, and be as solicitous of his neighbor’s honor as he is of his own” (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Mada</i>, 6:3).</i> It is possible that since it does not say “and thou shalt love <i>‘eth rei’acha’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">In that case the command would have been to love the <i>person</i> of one’s neighbor as much as one loves one’s own self. But instead the verse says <i>l’rei’acha</i>, which means “to [or ‘for’] your neighbor,” thus teaching that that which is good “for” your neighbor you should love as if it were good for youself.</i> as thyself,” but instead it likened them in the word <i>‘l’rei’acha’</i> [which literally means “to” thy neighbor], and similarly it states with reference to a proselyte, <i>and thou shalt love ‘lo’</i> (<i>him</i>) [but literally: “to” him] <i>as thyself</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 34. Here too the thought conveyed is: “that which is good for the proselyte you should love, as if it were good for your own self.”</i> that the meaning thereof is to equate the love of both [himself and his neighbor, or himself and the proselyte] in his mind. For sometimes a person will love his neighbor in certain matters, such as doing good to him in material wealth but not with wisdom and similar matters. But if he loves him completely, he will want his beloved friend to gain riches, properties, honor, knowledge and wisdom. However [because of human nature] he will still not want him to be his equal, for there will always be a desire in his heart that he should have more of these good things than his neighbor. Therefore Scripture commanded that this degrading jealousy should not exist in his heart, but instead a person should love to do abundance of good for his fellow-being as he does for himself, and he should place no limitations upon his love for him. It is for this reason that it is said of Jonathan’s [love for David], <i>for he loved him as he loved his own soul</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 20:17.</i> because Jonathan had removed [altogether] the attribute of jealousy from his heart, and he said [to David], <i>and thou shalt be king over Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:17.</i> etc.<br>Our Rabbis have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, <i>Kedoshim</i> 4:10-11.</i> the matters of taking vengeance and guarding a grudge [which are here forbidden], that they apply to cases where there is no monetary obligation, such as, “Lend me your sickle, lend me your hatchet.”<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">If he answers, “I will not lend it to you, just as you refused to lend it to me,” that is vengeance. But if he answers, “yHere it is; I am not like you, who would not lend it to me,” that is bearing a grudge.</i> For in a case where his friend owes him money, such as because of damage that he caused him or for similar reasons, one is not obliged to let his friend go free. On the contrary, he should sue him before the court and receive payment from him, on the basis of the verse which states, <i>as he hath done, so shall it be done to him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 24:19.</i> and he [who caused the damage] is himself obliged to pay just as he must pay back that which he borrowed or robbed; and how much more so in matters of life, [the next of kin] should take vengeance and guard the grudge against the murderer, until the blood of his brother be redeemed by a court that will render judgment according to the laws of the Torah.

Verse 19

YE SHALL KEEP ‘CHUKOTHAI’ (MY STATUTES). “And these are they: <i>thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind</i>, etc. <i>Chukim</i> (statutes) are the decrees of the King for which there is no reason [given].” This is Rashi’s language. But our Rabbis have not mentioned that the reasons for the commandments [mentioned in this verse] are hidden from us, and that the evil inclination and the idolaters raise objections against them, except in [the case of the prohibition against] wearing a garment made of wool and linen, but not in the case of mating of animals of diverse kinds [for which there is a reason, as will be explained later on].<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">And so why did Rashi mention this prohibition of mating diverse kinds of cattle, as an example of a “statute.” when the Rabbis never mentioned it as such?</i> And the intention of the Rabbis [in defining “statutes” as the laws of the King for which there is no reason] was not that these are decrees of the King of kings for which there are no reasons whatever, <i>for every word of G-d is tried</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 30:5.</i> [They meant] only that “statutes” are like the enactments which a king promulgates for his kingdom, without revealing their benefits to the people, and the people, not sensing these reasons, entertain questions about them in their hearts but they accept them nonetheless out of fear of the government. Similarly, “the statutes” of the Holy One, blessed be He, are His secrets in the Torah, which the people by means of their thinking do not grasp as they do in the case of <i>mishpatim</i> [“ordinances” — laws which conform to the human conception of justice], but yet they <i>all</i> have a proper reason and perfect benefit.<br>Now the reason for [the prohibitions against] <i>kilayim</i> [“mixed kinds,” as will be explained further on], is that G-d has created in the world various species among all living things, both plants and moving creatures, and He gave them a power of reproduction enabling them to exist forever as long, as He blessed be He, will desire the existence of the world, and He further endowed them with a power to bring forth [only] after their kind, and that they should never be changed, as it is said with reference to all of them [at the time of Creation], <i>after its kind</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:11, 21, 24.</i> This driving force in the normal mating of animals is for the sake of preserving the species, even as human beings engage in sexual activity for the sake of having children. Thus one who combines two different species, thereby changes and defies the work of Creation, as if he is thinking that the Holy One, blessed be He, has not completely perfected the world and he desires to help along in the creation of the world by adding to it new kinds of creatures. Moreover, the mating of diverse species of animals does not produce offspring, and even in the case of those that are by nature close to each other [such as the horse and the ass], from which offspring are born, such as mules, their seed is cut off, for they themselves [the mules] cannot produce offspring. Thus from the point of view of these two matters [i.e., the changing in the order of Creation and the sterility of the product, we see that] the act of combining different species is despicable and futile. Even when diverse species of vegetation are grafted together, their fruits do not reproduce afterwards, and they too are prohibited because of the two above-mentioned reasons [for the prohibition of mixing different species together]. This is the meaning of the prohibition [stated here in the verse], <i>thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed</i>, which in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 39 a.</i> constitutes a prohibition against grafting [diverse kinds of trees, or trees and vegetables, and is not a prohibition against merely sowing together diverse kinds of seed].<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation is based upon the fact that Scripture states, <i>thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed</i>. By placing these two prohibitions together, Scripture is teaching that just as in the case of cattle, the verse refers to well-definable objects [cattle], so in the case of sowing the field, Scripture refers to well-definable objects — trees, vegetables, etc., — and is not a mere prohibition against sowing diverse kinds of seed [although that too is forbidden], since these are not yet distinguishable.</i> But He has prohibited also the mere sowing together of diverse kinds of seed, because their nature and form change when they derive nutrition from each other, and thus each kernel of it is as if it were grafted together from two kinds. Similarly, He has forbidden to plow with an ox and an ass together,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:10.</i> because it is customary among tillers of the soil to bring their working animals into one cattle-shed, and there they might come to mate with a diverse kind.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">This reason is also stated by Maimonides in the Guide of the Perplexed, III, 49 (p. 267 in Friedlander’s translation).</i> And one of our colleagues<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">This thought which appears in the following text is expressly mentioned in the commentary on the Songs of Songs ascribed to Ramban but actually authored by Rabbi Ezra, one of the chief Cabalists of the period (see my introduction to this book in Kithvei Haramban, Vol. II, p. 474). Ramban’s expression here “and one of our colleagues etc.” thus clearly indicates that there was a group of scholars in Gerona who were dedicated to the study of the Cabala; and Ramban was one of that group. — Several points worthy of note are to be made with this expression “one of our colleagues.” It indicates the reticence with which the study of Cabala was regarded at that time. For even when crediting the thought to another scholar Ramban avoids identifying him by name. The role of Rabbi Ezra as one of the leading Cabalists at that period is indeed an undefined one, although it is known for a certainty that his influence was far-reaching. Additionally, the term <i>chaveireinu</i> (our colleague) indicates the closeness with which the group kept together, so that anyone who was part of them was called a <i>chaveir</i> (a colleague). The expression “one of our colleagues” may perhaps also indicate that Rabbi Ezra and Ramban were regarded as equals, for otherwise he would have referred to him as a teacher or master.</i> adds to the reason for the prohibition against mixing seeds, that it is in order not to throw into disorder the primary forces which bring about the growth of the plants, when they derive nutrition from each other,<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">A sense of the importance of ecology, of maintaining a proper well-ordered relationship between the primary forces of nature, is clearly discerned here.</i> as is indicated in the saying of our Rabbis in Bereshith Rabbah:<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshith Rabbah 10:7. See Vol. I, pp. 40, 70-71, where the same text is quoted.</i> “Said Rabbi Simon: There is not a single kind of herb that does not have a constellation in heaven which smites it and says to it, ‘Grow.’ It is with reference to this that Scripture says, <i>Knowest thou ‘chukoth shamayim’</i> (<i>the statutes of heavens</i>)? <i>Canst thou establish ‘mishtaro’</i> (<i>the dominion thereof</i>) <i>in the earth?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Job 38:33.</i> — [<i>mishtaro</i> being derived from the root <i>shoter</i> (executive officer)].” Now he who grafts diverse kinds of plants or sows seeds of diverse kinds with the intention that they derive nutrition from each other, thereby destroys <i>‘chukoth shamayim’</i> (<i>the statutes of heavens</i>). This is why He has said, <i>Ye shall keep ‘chukothai’</i> (<i>My statutes</i>), as they are the statutes of the heavens. And so did Rabbi Chanina in the name of Rabbi Pinchas say,<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 35:4.</i> that [the statutes mentioned here in the verse] are because of “the statutes with which I formed My world.” I have already written in the section of <i>Bereshith</i><sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:8. Vol. I, p. 70.</i> that all plants have their foundations in higher [forces], and it is from there that <i>the Eternal commanded</i> them <i>the blessing, even life forever</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 133:3.</i> Thus he who mixes different kinds of seeds, denies and throws into disorder the work of Creation.
NEITHER SHALL THERE COME UPON THEE A GARMENT ‘KILAYIM SHA’ATNEIZ’<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “mixed of two kinds of stuff.”</i> (MIXED OF LINEN AND WOOL). “Why is this stated [here, since in Deuteronomy 22:11 quoted further on it is more explicitly stated]? But because it is said [there in Deuteronomy], <i>Thou shalt not wear ‘sha’atneiz’</i> (<i>a mingled stuff</i>), <i>wool and linen together</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:11.</i> I might think that one is not to wear [loose pieces of] wool-shearings and stalks of flax; Scripture therefore states, <i>a garment</i>, [thus excluding from the terms of the prohibition the wearing of loose pieces of wool and flax which have not been woven together into a garment]. Whence do I know to include felted stuff [of linen and wool, which, though not spun and woven, are pressed into one material and worn as a garment]? Scripture therefore says, <i>sha’atneiz</i> — that which is <i>shu’a</i> (combed), <i>tavui</i> (spun) and <i>nuz</i> (twisted) together. And I say that the word <i>nuz</i> is an expression for materials which are compressed and twined one with the other to be joined [into a coherent web].” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But it does not appear to me to be correct, for felted stuff [of linen and wool] is not forbidden by law of the Torah, but only by enactment of the Rabbis, since it is only combed [but not spun and twisted, so why then did Rashi include it under the term <i>sha’atneiz</i>,] since that word implies all three actions — combing, spinning and twisting? And so we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Kilayim 9:9.</i> “Felted stuff [of wool and linen] is forbidden because it is combed,” [which clearly indicates that it is not spun and twisted]. And in the Gemara the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Niddah 61 b.</i> “Perhaps I might say [that Scripture prohibited wool and linen if they were] only combed, or spun, or twisted!” And the Gemara came to the conclusion: “The final law is as Mar Zutra [who said that this Scriptural prohibition applies only if all three acts were done], since the Merciful One expressed them all in one term” [<i>sha’atneiz</i>, which as mentioned above is a combination of three words: <i>shu’a</i> (combed), <i>tavui</i> (spun) and <i>nuz</i> (twisted)]. But the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim, stating:<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 4:18.</i> “I know only that a garment [must not be worn if made of wool and linen together]. But whence do I know to include felted stuff? From that which the verse states, <i>sha’atneiz</i>” — that Beraitha intends to include things which are not “a garment,” on the basis of the verse <i>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:11.</i> since the word “garment” is not mentioned there, [but it does not intend to teach, as Rashi interpreted it, that wool and linen even if only combed but not spun and twisted, are already forbidden as <i>sha’atneiz</i>]. This interpretation [of the Torath Kohanim] is a basic principle, since even an article which is not “a garment” [if worn as a vestment] is also forbidden by law of the Torah to be made of wool and linen, such as where one plaits threads [of wool and linen] and makes of them a belt, or anything similar, providing only that the threads were combed, spun and twisted. The Torath Kohanim mentioned “felted stuffs” merely as a Biblical support for a Rabbinical enactment, since these are forbidden only by the law of the Rabbis, as they are not “a garment” [because the two diverse materials are only combed, but not spun and twisted].<br>Similarly, in respect of that which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote with reference to combing, that [the wool and linen] must also be compressed and twisted together, and in a similar manner he also wrote in his commentaries to the Gemara,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 5 b; Niddah 61 b. See my Hebrew commentary p. 122.</i> other scholars,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Tosafoth, Yebamoth 5 b.</i> have already commented that Rashi’s interpretation is not in accord with what the Rabbis have said [in the following text of the Talmud]:<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 39 a. To understand the following text it is necessary to clarify these two points: (a) The commandment of <i>Tzitzith</i> (Fringes) consists of making for each of the four corners of the garment four threads specially woven for that purpose. They are then passed through a hole situated a few thumbs’ breadth away from each of the four corners, the threads are doubled, and two knots are then formed at the lower edge of the garment, followed by a series of windings and other double knots (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 22, for precise details). (b) A cardinal principle in Torah law is that, subject to certain general exceptions, any duty of fulfilling a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment (see Ramban on Exodus 20:8 — Vol. II, pp. 309-310). This is derived from the juxtaposition of these two verses: <i>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together. Thou shalt make twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself</i> (Deuteronomy 22:11-12). The closeness of the two verses intimates that the commandment of Fringes overrides the prohibition of <i>sha’atneiz</i>, so that the Fringes may be made with threads of wool even if the garment itself is of linen. — The Gemara now argues on the basis of the second principle mentioned, that we must say that the upper knots [formed at the lower edge of the garment] after the four threads are passed through the opening and doubled, are obligatory by law of the Torah, “for should you think etc.”</i> “You must deduce from this<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., from the fact that the Torah intimated a special permission showing that the commandment of the Fringes overrides the prohibition of wearing <i>sha’atneiz</i> (see Note 116 (b)).</i> that the upper knots<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">“Knots.” The Hebrew is <i>kesher</i> — “knot” in the singular. But Ramban himself further on refers to “two knots” which are made at the lower edge of the garment. Basically, however, it is the first knot with which we are concerned, since if the threads are of wool and the garment of linen, and they are joined together with only one knot, which holds them together, nonetheless the prohibition of <i>sha’atneiz</i> would be incurred by wearing them afterwards, were it not for the fact that in that case the Torah especially permitted it.</i> in the Fringes are required by Scriptural law. For if you should think that they are not required by Scriptural law, why then did the Merciful One have to state a [special] permission for using mingled stuff of wool and linen in Fringes! Do we not hold the law to be established that if one fastens two pieces together with only one stitch, it is not considered joined!”<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Hence if the commandment of the Fringes required merely the passing of the four threads through the hole, and then doubling them, without tying them with a knot, there would have been no need for the Torah to intimate a special permission for <i>sha’atneiz</i> in Fringes, since the woolen threads and linen garment would not be considered “joined together.” But if, on the other hand, after the threads are passed through the opening and are doubled they must then be tied with a knot, that constitutes already an act of joining the woolen Fringes and the linen garment together, which ordinarily would render it forbidden to be worn, and then we would understand that in the case of the Fringes, the Torah had to intimate a special permission. — Thus far is the reasoning of the Talmud. Ramban now deduces from it, that in order to be included in the prohibition of <i>sha’atneiz</i> it is not necessary that the wool and linen themselves be combed, spun and twisted together, as Rashi had written.</i> Thus the Rabbis [of the Talmud] have revealed to us that a garment made of linen, in which woolen fringes have been tied with two knots, constitutes diverse kinds by law of the Torah, even though they have not been compressed and twined together!<br>Rather, the matter is as follows: Scripture here stated, <i>Neither shall there come upon thee a garment ‘kilayim sha’atneiz,’</i> meaning to say that every garment that is made of a <i>thread</i> which has been combed, spun and twisted, we should not wear if it is <i>kilayim</i>, that is, of mingled stuff. And in the Book of Deuteronomy He explained in addition that we should not wear anything which was combed, spun and twisted of wool and linen if they be together, that is to say, if the wool and linen are joined together with [at least] two stitches. This means to say that [even] if the wool and linen were each combed, spun and twisted separately, they may not be attached together, for when they are joined they constitute <i>kilayim</i> (mingled stuff); just as He said [in the preceding verse there], <i>Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:10. Now just as in this case the prohibition applies to joining together in work an ox and an ass, which are two separate creatures, even so in the verse on <i>sha’atneiz</i> which follows, the prohibition applies only where the <i>thread</i> of wool was treated to all three actions separately, and so also the <i>thread</i> of linen, and then they were both <i>joined</i> together.</i> that is to say, if they are tied and joined to each other. And in the case of garments, fastening with two stitches already constitutes “joining” them, it being derived by the Rabbis from the word <i>together</i> [<i>wool and linen ‘together’</i>] that two stitches constitute a joining together. From there [i.e., from the verse in Deuteronomy where the word “garment” is not mentioned, as it is here in the verse before us], the Rabbis have learned that mingled stuff is forbidden although they are not in a garment, but even if one plaited threads of thick material, and made of them belts, although they were not woven [for a vestment], similar to what we are taught in a Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Kilayim 9:9.</i> “One may not tie a cord of wool on to one made of linen, in order to bind up the loins.” And the expression <i>nuz</i> [in the word <i>sha’atneiz</i>] is a shortened word<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning: “<i>naloz</i> (he preverses) <i>umeiliez</i> (and turns) his Father in heaven against him” (<i>ibid.</i>, 9:8). “The word <i>nuz</i> is thus an expression of perverseness and crookedness, similar to the twisting of threads with each other. It is for this reason that the Merciful One had to permit expressly <i>kilayim</i> in Fringes, since in the case of the Fringes the threads must be twisted” (Ramban in his commentary to Tractate Niddah, 61b). See further in the text before us.</i> in this composite term, just like the word <i>tavui</i> (spun), of which there is only the letter <i>teth</i> [in the word <i>sha’atneiz</i>]. And the meaning thereof [i.e., of the word <i>nuz</i>] is in my opinion like the word <i>naloz</i> (perversing), of the expressions: <i>an abomination to the Eternal is ‘naloz’</i> (<i>the perverse</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 3:32.</i> meaning he who turns aside and perverses his paths; <i>‘unelozim’</i> (<i>and perverse</i>) <i>in their paths</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:15.</i> meaning those who are crooked and turn aside [unto their crooked ways],<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalms 125:5.</i> for anything which is spun [like a thread] is turned and crooked. This is similar to what we are taught in a Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Kilayim 9:8.</i> “Rabbi Shimon<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">In our text of the Mishnah: “Rabbi Shimon the son of Elazar.” Ramban’s version, however, suggests that it is Rabbi Shimon the son of Yochai, who is always referred to as “Rabbi Shimon” without further qualification.</i> says: [The meaning of the word <i>sha’atneiz</i> is that he who disregards this law] is perverse and turns his Father in heaven against him,” meaning to say that the Glorious Name turns away His merciful ways from him, similar to what is said, <i>and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 22:27.</i> And in the language of the Sages, this word [<i>naloz</i>] is used in a shortened form, thus:<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Shemoth Rabbah 37:2.</i> “This can be compared to a king’s son <i>sh’noz</i><sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">In our text of the Shemoth Rabbah the word is <i>sh’zachah da’ato alav</i> — “whose mind was charged with haughtiness upon him.” Ramban will later on explain the text before us as meaning: “who turned [or perverted] his heart into an evil path.”</i> his heart upon him, and he took a digging tool to undermine his father’s house,” [the word <i>sh’noz</i> meaning] that “he turned his heart to an evil path.” It is of the same root [as the word <i>naloz</i>, in its shortened form <i>nuz</i>], that the Sages have said in the Talmud [in Tractate] Sanhedrin:<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 41 b.</i> “<i>Minizyathei</i><sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">In our text of the Gemara: <i>minezihuthei</i>, which Rashi explains as meaning: “if you had wanted ‘to rail at us’ we could not have answered you at all. But as you spoke kindly, we will tell you many things that we have said about it.” Ramban will explain the text before us [which conforms to the reading of the Munich Talmud manuscript] as meaning: “if you had wanted to turn away the matter from the right course etc.”</i> of the master, we could not have answered him at all,” that is to say, if you had wanted to insist and turn away the matter [from the right course], we would not have known how to answer you at all. <i>Nizyathei</i> is thus like <i>nilzyathei</i>, that is to say, “his turning away” from the correct path. This is the true and correct interpretation in this matter [of <i>sha’atneiz</i>]. It was for this reason that it was necessary for the Torah to grant permission for <i>kilayim</i> (mingled stuff) in Fringes,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Note 116 (b). Ramban’s intention is that although the woolen <i>Fringes</i> are not plaited or woven together with the <i>cloth</i> of the four-cornered garment, to which they are later attached, nonetheless since the Fringes are <i>themselves</i> combed, spun and twisted, and then attached to the cloth which was likewise combed, spun and twisted, as explained above, that is a sufficient “mingling of stuffs” to constitute <i>sha’atneiz</i>. Hence it was necessary for the Torah to grant permission etc.,</i> although the Fringes are not plaited and do not constitute a garment. This then is the law of the Torah [i.e., if the linen garment was made of threads which were combed, spun and twisted, and the woolen threads were likewise combed, spun and twisted, then these two kinds of threads must not be joined together]. However, the Sages prohibited it even if the threads were only made in one way — either combed, or spun, or twisted. It is for this reason that we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Kilayim 9:9.</i> “Felted stuff [of wool and linen] is forbidden because it is combed. An edging of wool on a linen garment<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the woolen edging is not woven together with the linen garment, but is merely attached to it by some artificial means (Tifereth Yisrael, Kilayim 9:9, Note 46).</i> is forbidden since it interlaces the web of the garment.” All these are prohibited by law of the Rabbis.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">In summary then, two major differences of opinion have appeared between Rashi and Ramban on the law of <i>sha’atneiz:</i> (a) According to Rashi the Scriptural prohibition applies where the wool and linen were <i>either</i> combed, <i>or</i> spun, <i>or</i> twisted. Hence felted stuff which is only combed, is forbidden by law of the Torah. According to Ramban, the Scriptural prohibition applies only where the wool and linen went through the process of all three acts mentioned, and therefore felted stuff which is only combed, is forbidden only by enactment of the Rabbis. (b) According to Rashi the prohibition of <i>sha’atneiz</i> applies where the wool and linen were combed [or spun or twisted] <i>together</i>. According to Ramban, the prohibition applies where the <i>threads</i> of wool were separately combed, spun and twisted, and likewise the <i>threads</i> of linen were combed, spun and twisted, and then they were both attached to each other with a minimum of two stitches, or tied with a knot. — Rambam’s presentation of this law follows that of Rashi, while the Rashba follows that of Ramban.</i><br>Now the reason for the prohibition of mingled stuff in garments is in order to keep far away from the mixing together of different species, and He therefore prohibited [the threads, i.e., of wool and linen] from which garments are usually made. But the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] had said in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Guide of the Perplexed III, 37.</i> that the reason for the prohibition of wearing a garment made of wool and linen, is because at that time this kind of garment was used by the priests and magicians to adorn themselves when performing their activities, and he [Maimonides] says that he found it so written in their books. And since this was for them a matter of great importance, and very much desired by them in order that they should do their activities [in honor of] the idols and demons, therefore the Torah removed it from being worn by all people, since the Torah intends to blot out their deeds and efface their memory.

Verse 20

AND WHOSOEVER LIETH CARNALLY WITH A WOMAN THAT IS A BONDMAID, ‘NECHEREPHETH’ FOR A MAN — “‘Destined’ for a man. I know not of a similar usage of this root [<i>choraph</i>] in Scripture.” This is Rashi’s language. It appears to me that it is associated with the expression, <i>as I was in the days of ‘chorpi,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Job 29:4.</i> meaning, in the days of my youth. Similarly, <i>my heart shall not ‘yecheraph’ me so long as I live</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 27:6.</i> meaning that I will not have the heart of a youth [who has not yet matured in wisdom]. The days of youth are called “the days of <i>choreph</i>” [a term which means “winter”], since the winter is at the beginning of the year, while the days of old age correspond to the summer which are the days of gathering in. Scripture, then, is stating here that she is a bondmaid, a young girl designated for a certain man, for a concubine who ministers to a man and with whom he has sexual relations, is called “his maiden,” just as every ministering person is also called [the master’s] lad. It is very common in the language of the Sages to say of a woman who has sexual relations with a man, that she is “an attendant to him.” And it is this [relationship that is here called] <i>necherepheth</i>, meaning that she has become a maiden [— attendant] to a man, and is known to him, called in the vernacular [i.e., in Spanish] <i>mancipada</i> (designated to a man). In the language of the Sages likewise we find the expression:<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 58 b.</i> “that slave’s girl” [assigned to him by his master]. Thus the meaning thereof is that she is not completely as his wife, but he has betrothed her and she is to him a maiden-attendant.
BIKORETH’ (AN INVESTIGATION) SHALL BE MADE. “It is for the court to investigate the matter in order not to make him liable to death [that is to say, if she were a free woman betrothed to a man, and she had committed adultery, the punishment would be death, but this is not the case in this instance]. BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT FREE, and her betrothal was not complete.” This is Rashi’s language, and so did all the commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra, R’dak in his Sefer Hashorashim, root <i>bakeir</i>.</i> interpret the verse. And if so, Scripture then is warning the court to make this investigation because she is like a married woman, and they might [easily] make a mistake [in deciding his punishment]. But their interpretation does not please me, for it is a fact that is self-understood that the matter will be investigated, and that the court will not kill a person in vain. For they do such an investigation in all cases involving the death penalty!<br>Now it is my opinion that this [word <i>bikoreth</i>] is a unique one in Scripture, but it is a common term in the Aramaic language and in the expressions of our Rabbis, namely, the word <i>hefkeir</i> [“ownerless” — with the letter <i>beth</i> in <i>bikoreth</i> and the letter <i>fei</i> in <i>hefkeir</i> interchanging]. For the word is essentially <i>hevkeir</i> [with the letter <i>veth</i>, which is equivalent to the <i>beth</i> in <i>bikoreth</i>], just as the Rabbis have said [in a Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Peah 6:1.</i> “The School of Shammai say: <i>Hevkeir</i> [produce that is proclaimed ownerless] for the benefit of the poor [only], is deemed <i>hevkeir</i> [and therefore the produce is free from the obligation to give tithes, since ownerless produce is exempt from tithes].<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Thus we find the Mishnah using the word <i>hevkeir</i> [with the letter <i>veth</i>] instead of <i>hefkeir</i> [with the letter <i>fei</i>].</i> And the School of Hillel say: [It is not valid] unless the owner makes it equally free for the rich, just as in the Sabbatical year” [when the produce of the field is free for poor and rich alike, and is exempt from tithes]. And again we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Shevi’ith 9:4.</i> “One may eat [produce of the Sabbatical year] which has been brought into the house <i>al hamuvkar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Here too, the Mishnah uses the term <i>hamuvkar</i> instead of <i>hamufkar</i>. In our text of the Mishnah the latter usage is found.</i> [only as long as similar produce is still found ‘free’ in the field as food for the animals], but not as long as it is still found watched over in private ownership.” Yonathan ben Uziel also translated, <i>vain and light fellows</i><sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 9:4. See my Hebrew commentary p. 124, Note 55, about a different version in our text of Yonathan.</i> as “idlers <i>uvakrin</i>,” — “and ‘free’ men” [i.e., men defying the law]. <i>By their lies and ‘by their wantonness’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 23:32.</i> [Yonathan ben Uziel translated] <i>uvakrithon</i><sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Here too Yonathan uses the <i>veth</i> [<i>uvakrithon</i>] instead of the <i>fei</i> [<i>ufakrithon</i> — “and their irreverence”].</i> (“and by their irresponsibility”). They also say<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">It would seem that the Targum Yerushalmi quoted here was not before Ramban. Hence he quotes it by hearsay: “They also say …”</i> that the expression, <i>and the seventh year thou shalt let it rest ‘u’n'tashta’</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:11.</i> the Jerusalem Targum<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">See in Vol. I, p. 371, Note 128.</i> renders as <i>uthevakarno</i> [“and thou shalt renounce ownership thereof,” thus also using the root <i>hefkeir</i> in the form of <i>hevkeir</i>]. Similarly throughout the Mishnah [the term <i>hefkeir</i>] is written with a <i>veth</i> [i.e., <i>hevkeir</i>]. But in the Gemara they became used to saying <i>hefkeir</i> [with a <i>fei</i>], as these letters [the <i>veth</i> and the <i>fei</i>] were used interchangeably by them, just as from the expression <i>the grains ‘ovshu’</i> (<i>shrivel</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Joel 1:17.</i> they used the word <i>‘ofshu’</i> (musty). This is likewise found in many places in the Scriptures, as I have mentioned on the verse <i>Thou didst blow with Thy wind</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 15:10.</i> And the interpretation of this verse [before us] is as follows: He says concerning this bondmaid that “although she is ‘attending’ this man, she is not considered his wife because she is to him <i>bikoreth</i>, that is to say, she is treated by him as a loose person, and therefore <i>they are not to be put to death</i> as is the law of the adulterer and the adulteress when the woman is [properly] married; <i>for freedom has not been given to her</i> [from her status as a bondmaid] to be his real wife [and therefore he who lies carnally with her is not to be put to death], but instead he is to bring a guilt-offering because <i>she is designated for a man</i>.” And Onkelos who translated <i>‘bikoreth’ shall be made</i> as “<i>bikurto</i> shall be made,” uses a language similar to that of Yonathan ben Uziel, in his rendition [of the Hebrew <i>ufochazim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 9:4. See my Hebrew commentary p. 124, Note 55, about a different version in our text of Yonathan.</i> (and light follows)] as <i>uvakrin</i> (men defying the Law).<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s intention is to point out that Onkelos’ rendition here of the Hebrew <i>bikoreth</i> as <i>bikurto</i> is thus similar to Yonathan’s rendition of the Hebrew <i>ufochazim</i> as <i>uvakrin</i>, which is of the root <i>hevkeir</i>, or in its later form <i>hefkeir</i>, which denotes something ownerless, loose, etc. It thus corroborates Ramban’s interpretation that the word <i>bikoreth</i> in the verse before us is of the term <i>hefkeir</i>, as explained in the text.</i>

Verse 23

VA’ARALTEM ORLATHO’ THE FRUIT THEREOF. “[This means literally]: ‘ye shall close its closing,’ meaning that it shall be closed up and hidden so as not to have any benefit from it.” This is Rashi’s language, and he has explained it well. And if so, <i>‘erel’ of heart</i><sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 44:9.</i> means “closed of heart,”<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">It is generally translated: <i>uncircumcised in heart</i>.</i> just as it is said, <i>and I will rend the enclosure of their heart</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 13:8.</i> Similarly, <i>‘areila’ is their ear</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 6:10.</i> means “their ear is closed and dulled so that no sound enters therein.” And <i>‘aral’ of the lips</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 6:12.</i> means “closed of lips,” for defective speech is a result of an impediment and obstruction in the veins of the tongue, or sometimes in those of the lips, which have not been properly opened. Speech is referred to in Scripture by the term “opening,” thus: <i>Open thy mouth for the dumb</i><sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 31:8.</i> [which means, “speak up in the cause of the dumb”]<i>; Job opened his mouth;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Job 3:1.</i> <i>and the opening of my lips shall be right things;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 8:6.</i> <i>keep the doors</i> [literally: “openings”] <i>of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Micah 7:5.</i> Now Scripture uses the expression “closing up” with reference to the fruit of the first three years, so as to prohibit the deriving of any benefit from it, although it does not express it in this way with reference to other things from which we are also forbidden to derive any benefit [e.g., diverse kinds in a vineyard].<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:9.</i> This is because the appearance of the fruit in its earliest stage is called “opening,” just as it is said, <i>the vine-blossom has opened</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 7:13.</i> Therefore He said, <i>three years shall it be ‘areilim’ unto you</i>, as if the fruits are closed up in the trees, and have not put forth buds nor opened blossoms.<br>The reason for this commandment is to honor the Eternal with the first of all our produce of the fruits of the tree and the increase of the vineyard, and that we are not to eat of them until we bring all the fruit of one year [i.e., the fourth year after the planting] <i>for giving praise unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> Now the fruit of the first three years is not fit to be brought before <i>the Glorious Name</i><sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:58.</i> because it is small; neither does the tree in its first three years impart good taste or flavor into its fruit. Besides, most trees do not bring forth fruit at all until the fourth year. Therefore we are to wait with all of them [an equal period of time], and are not to taste of their fruit until we have brought of the planting which we have done, all its first good fruit to be holy before G-d, and there [in Jerusalem] we are to eat it and praise the Name of the Eternal. Thus this commandment is like that of the first-fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:1-11.</i> It is furthermore true that the fruit which comes forth from the tree when it is first planted, contains an abundance of moisture which attaches to and is harmful to the body and it is not good to eat it, just like a fish which has no scales and all food, forbidden by the Torah, which are harmful also<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 11:13, and 17:11, that the harm is chiefly to the soul of the person. This is the intention of Ramban’s expression here that the forbidden foods are “also” harmful to the body.</i> to the body.<br>The Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] also gave in the Moreh Nebuchim the same type of reason for this commandment as he gave for most of these commandments, namely, that the magicians and sorcerers of those days used to practice certain deeds of witchcraft at the time of the planting of the trees, thinking that by so doing they would accelerate the coming out of the fruits before their natural time, and when the fruits appeared, they would offer them to the idol in the name of which that witchcraft was performed. Therefore the Torah commanded that the fruits which come out before three years [after the planting of the tree] should be forbidden [to derive any benefit from], in order that people should not come to practice these evil deeds, for most trees bring forth fruits in the fourth year, and that we are then to eat them before G-d [in Jerusalem], contrary to their eating of them before the idols.

YE SHALL NOT EAT WITH THE BLOOD. “This passage has been explained in many different ways in Tractate Sanhedrin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 63 a. See “The Commandments,” Vol. II pp. 401-2, where all these various interpretations are listed.</i> This is the language of Rashi. Now the conclusion of that discussion in the Talmud is that all those interpretations [of the verse before us] are Torah-ordained, since Scripture included all manner of “eating with the blood” in one negative commandment. And if so, that which Scripture states in the case of Saul, <i>Behold, the people sin against the Eternal, in that they eat with the blood</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 14:33.</i> means that they transgressed one of the prohibitions included in this negative commandment, since they were eating of an animal [slaughtered properly] before its life had entirely left it. It is with reference to this that Scripture states there, <i>And the people flew upon the spoil</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 32.</i> like a bird of prey that tears its victim and eats it, <i>and they took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 32.</i> Because of the abundance of spoil of cattle [that they had taken from the Philistines], as soon as [they were slaughtered properly and] their blood was spilled on the ground, they tore off their limbs and ate them before life had entirely left the animals.<br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, this seems to have been a kind of witchcraft or divination, since [the meaning of this passage] may be deduced from its context; [i.e., from the second half of this verse which states, <i>neither shall ye practice divination nor soothsaying</i>, we may deduce that the first half of the verse, <i>Ye shall not eat with the blood</i> also refers to some form of witchcraft, as will be explained]. Thus they used to spill the blood [of the cattle] and gather it in a hollow, which was then attended, according to their opinion, by the satyrs, and they<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the satyrs. Having assembled around the blood, the satyrs would then be present at the meal, at which time they would inform the people of future events. All this was part of this particular kind of witchcraft.</i> would eat at their tables to tell them future events. Now when the Israelites were at that time camping with Saul, they were very much afraid of the Philistines, and Saul did nothing except for inquiring of the Urim and Thummim,<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:30. See Ramban there (Vol. II, pp. 480-484).</i> as it is said, <i>Let us draw near hither unto G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 14:36.</i> while the people were inquiring of the satyrs or of witchcraft to know their way and what to do, and they were eating <i>with the blood</i> in order to perform that craft [mentioned above]. It is for this reason that Scripture there states, <i>Then they told Saul, saying: ‘Behold, the people sin against the Eternal, in that they eat with the blood.’ And he said: ‘Ye have dealt treacherously,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 33.</i> meaning to say: “Behold, G-d has wrought for you this day this great salvation, and you inquire of no-gods! It is treachery!” I will yet explain the prohibition against soothsaying and enchanting.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:9.</i>

Verse 29

PROFANE NOT THY DAUGHTER, TO MAKE HER A HARLOT. “This refers to one who gives his unmarried daughter [to a man] without the intention of betrothal. LEST THE LAND FALL INTO HARLOTRY. If you do so, the soil too will be unfaithful to you and it will produce its fruits in another place and not in your Land. And so does Scripture state, <i>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there hath been no latter rain, and thou hadst a harlot’s forehead</i> etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 3:3.</i> This is Rashi’s language. But I have not understood his opinion, for the term “harlotry” in the Torah nowhere applies to an unmarried woman, since it is the accepted decision of the law<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 61 b.</i> that if an unmarried man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman, without the intention of thereby making her his wife, he has [nonetheless] not rendered her thereby “a harlot.” And in Tractate Sanhedrin the Sages have clearly stated this principle:<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 50 b.</i> “<i>And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by becoming a harlot</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:9.</i> I might think that this applies even if she be unmarried.” Thereupon the Rabbis asked:<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 51 a.</i> “[But how could one think this to be the case?] Is it not written <i>by becoming a harlot</i> [and the term ‘harlot’ applies only to a <i>married</i> woman who commits adultery]?” To this question the Rabbis answered, that [the above supposition was] “in accordance with the [unaccepted] opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who said that if an unmarried man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman, without the intention of thereby making her his wife, he <i>does</i> render her ‘a harlot.’” [From this text it is obvious that the accepted opinion of the Sages is that if she was unmarried, he does <i>not</i> render her “a harlot.”] Similarly the Rabbis have said that the verse <i>They</i> [i.e., the priests] <i>shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:7.</i> does not apply to an unmarried woman, but only to a proselytess and a freed bondwoman, or to one who had intercourse with a man in the nature of fornication, such as with a man whose betrothal to her would not be valid, as is explained in Yebamoth<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 61 b.</i> and in the Sifra:<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, <i>Emor</i> 1:7.</i> “<i>A woman that is a harlot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:7.</i> Rabbi Yehudah says that this refers to a sterile woman. But the Sages say: The word ‘harlot’ refers only to a proselytess, a freed bondwoman, or to one who had intercourse with a man in the nature of fornication. Rabbi Eliezer says: Even if an unmarried man has sexual relations with an unmarried woman, without the intention of thereby making her his wife, this too [is a case of the ‘harlot’].” Similarly the Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Terumah 29 b.</i> with reference to the prohibition, <i>Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot … into the House of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 23:19.</i> that this has no application whatever to an unmarried woman. But the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, <i>Kedoshim</i> 7:1.</i> [which is the source for Rashi’s interpretation] and which is also mentioned in Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 76 a.</i> [namely, that the verse before us refers to one who gives his <i>unmarried</i> daughter for immorality], may either be in accordance with the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer [mentioned above] and is not the final decision of the law, or it may be a case of one who gives his [unmarried] daughter for immorality with a person with whom she can contract no marital status, such as with a Cuthean or a slave, or any of those persons [with whom sexual relations are forbidden] by punishment of excision or death by the hands of the court, which is “harlotry” in the opinion of the Sages. It is this which they intended in saying, “[this verse refers to] one who gives his unmarried daughter to a man without the intention of marriage,” that is to say, to a man with whom it is impossible that there be a marital status.<br>Similarly, that which the Rabbi taught there in the Sifra<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Sifra, <i>Kedoshim</i> 7:3. This was mentioned here by Rashi.</i> with reference to the expression <i>lest the Land fall into harlotry</i>, that the fruits of the Land will turn faithless [and grow in other places and not in your Land], is a homiletic exposition derived from the word <i>ha’aretz</i> (the Land), since it is not written “lest <i>the people</i> of the Land fall into harlotry.” But the main intention of this expression is [to establish] a second negative commandment, which the author of the “Hilchoth Gedoloth”<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. II, p. 350, Note 70.</i> has already counted in his enumeration of the [three hundred and sixty-five] negative commandments, it being an admonition directed to the man who commits the immoral act and to the daughter herself, that she should not give herself over to immoral relationships. And it is on the basis of this [interpretation of the verse] that the Rabbis have said there in that Beraitha [in Torath Kohanim]: “And similarly she who gives herself over to immoral relationships [transgresses a negative commandment].” And the meaning of the verse is [as follows]: Since a daughter is in the control of her father, and he is permitted “in her youth” [i.e., when she is not yet twelve and a half years old] to betroth her to a man, and to cause her to enter the bridal-canopy, and one who violates or seduces her must pay the fine to the father [thus accordingly we might think that the father is at liberty to allow a man to have an immoral relationship with his unmarried daughter], therefore Scripture explained that he is not permitted to give her to anyone for immoral purposes, admonishing [first] the father [against doing it] by means of a negative commandment. After having admonished the father, He warned also those engaged in the harlotry, the man and the woman.<br>Now Rashi wrote in the section of <i>Emor El Hakohanim:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 21:7.</i> “<i>A harlot</i>. This is a woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man who is forbidden to her [as a husband], such as those [whom she may not marry] under the penalty of excision, or a <i>Nathin</i> [a descendant of the Gibeonites<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>‘Nathin’</i> [literally: givers] derived from the verse in Joshua 9:27 stating that Joshua “gave” the Gibeonites as hewers of wood etc.</i>] or a <i>mamzer</i>” [i.e., a person born from a union which is itself prohibited under the penalty of excision]. Now this comment constitutes an admission on the part of Rashi that the term “harlotry” does not apply where marriage between them would be possible, except that he does include under this term [of “harlotry”] also those that are forbidden by means of a negative commandment [the punishment for which being whipping, such as marriage to a <i>mamzer</i>]. This is also Rashi’s opinion in his commentaries on the Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 61 a.</i> [i.e., that “harlotry” applies to all cases where he is forbidden to her — even if only under the penalty of whipping]. But this too is not correct, for it is only [by means of intercourse with] those whom she may not marry under the penalty of excision, or a Cuthean or a bondman with whom she can contract no marital status, that she is rendered a “harlot” so that a priest who takes her as his wife is liable to whipping because of [marrying] a harlot; but [as a result of intercourse] with those whom she is prohibited [to marry] by means of a [mere] negative commandment — such as a <i>mamzer</i>, or an Ammonite or Moabite proselyte — she is not rendered a “harlot,” and a priest who takes her as his wife is not liable to whipping.

Verse 30

YE SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. There are many warnings in the Torah regarding [the observance of] the Sabbath, just as in the case of idolatry, because the law of the Sabbath too, is equal to all the commandments, for one who does not observe it, denies the [Divine] Creation and has no Torah at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis, Vol. I, p. 17, Note 4.</i> Our Rabbis have an interpretation on this verse. Thus they said here in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 7:7.</i> “I might think that the building of the Sanctuary overrides the Sabbath; Scripture therefore states, <i>Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My Sanctuary: I am the Eternal</i>” [meaning: “not even the erection of the Sanctuary can override the keeping of the Sabbath”]. And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], He commands here concerning the Great Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">A Cabalistic term referring to one of the emanations (Beiur Ha’lvush in his commentary to Ricanti who interprets the words of Ramban here).</i> and the Sabbath which is His Sanctuary [on high], that it be both guarded and reverenced. For this reason the work on the erection of the Sanctuary [on earth] does not override the Sabbath and the Sanctuary [on high]. The student learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand.

Verse 31



Verse 32

THOU SHALT RISE UP BEFORE THE HOARY HEAD. “I might think that one is to rise before an uncultured old man; Scripture therefore states, <i>and thou shalt honor the face of ‘zakein’</i> (<i>the old man</i>). <i>Zakein</i> [from the root <i>kanah</i>, acquire] means only one who has ‘acquired’ wisdom.” This is Rashi’s language. And the text of the Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 7:12.</i> as it is taught in the Gemara of Tractate Kiddushin<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 32 b.</i> [is as follows: “I might think that one is to rise before an uncultured old man;] Scripture therefore states <i>zakein</i>, the word <i>zakein</i> meaning only one who is wise, as it is said, <i>Gather unto Me seventy men ‘miziknei’</i> (<i>of the elders</i>) <i>of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 11:16. And since these seventy elders were to constitute together with Moses the members of the Sanhedrin, it is clear that <i>miziknei</i> means “of the wise men” of Israel.</i> And Rabbi Yosei the Galilean says: The word <i>zakein</i> means only one who has ‘acquired’ wisdom, as it is said, <i>The Eternal ‘kanani’</i> (<i>made me</i>) [literally: acquired me, i.e., wisdom] <i>at the beginning of His way</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 8:22. The sense conveyed is: “G-d created me [i.e., wisdom] to be His acquisition at the beginning of Creation.”</i> Now according to the words of both of them [i.e., the First Sage in this Beraitha and Rabbi Yosei the Galilean], this commandment [of honoring the aged] applies only if he is a scholar. And Onkelos who rendered the verse before us: “thou shalt rise up before him who understands [the knowledge of] the Torah, and honor the face of the aged,” would also seem to agree with this opinion [that <i>zakein</i> is one who “acquired” wisdom]. Yet despite all this, the concluding opinion of the Gemara in accordance with the final decision of the law is not so, for the Rabbis have said [in the Gemara]:<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 32 b.</i> “Isi the son of Yehudah says: Any hoary head is included [under the terms of this commandment], and Rabbi Yochanan said: The final decision of the law is as Isi the son of Yehudah interpreted it.” Thus Scripture is commanding [in the first half of the verse] to honor any old man, even the uncultured, that is, the unlearned, and then [in the second half of the verse] it gives another commandment concerning the <i>zakein</i>, that is one who has acquired wisdom, even if he be young and learned. It is possible that this is also the opinion of Onkelos, except that he translated <i>the hoary head</i> as “young and learned” [and hence the <i>first</i> half of his translation reads, “thou shalt rise up before him who understands — the knowledge of the Torah,” meaning even if he is young and learned], since the term <i>zakein</i> [in the <i>second</i> half of the verse, which clearly means “one who has acquired wisdom”] came and indicated that the term <i>hoary head</i> includes all kinds of <i>old age</i>, whether old in the knowledge of the Torah or old in days.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">For otherwise why did the Torah use two different terms: <i>seiva</i> (the hoary head) and <i>zakein</i> (the old man)? Onkelos thus reasoned that since <i>zakein</i> definitely means “he who has acquired wisdom,” it shows that <i>seiva</i> must mean all kinds of old people, whether learned or not learned. Hence in translating the verse he rendered <i>zakein</i> first and then <i>seiva</i>, although in the Hebrew text the order of the terms is the opposite. In short, then, it may be that Onkelos also agrees with the opinion of Isi the son of Yehudah that one must show honor to all kinds of old people, whether aged in the knowledge of the Torah or just aged in years.</i>

Verse 3

BECAUSE HE HATH GIVEN OF HIS SEED UNTO MOLECH, TO DEFILE MY SANCTUARY — “The congregation of Israel which is sanctified unto Me.” This is Rashi’s language. I have already hinted at this,<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 18:21.</i> how on account of one man’s sin the congregation of Israel which is sanctified to His Great Name can become defiled. And the Sages have [also] already hinted at this in their homiletic interpretations when saying:<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Berachoth 35 b.</i> “He who enjoys anything of this world without saying a benediction, is considered as if he had robbed the Holy One, blessed be He, and the congregation of Israel, as it is said, <i>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith: ‘It is no transgression,’ the same is the companion of a destroyer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 28:24.</i> The expression <i>his father</i> refers only to the Holy One, blessed be He, and <i>his mother</i> refers only to the congregation of Israel. <i>The same is the companion of the destroyer</i>, he is a companion of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, <i>who caused Israel to sin</i>, against their Father in heaven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 12:28-33; 14:16.</i> For the purpose of Creation was that people should offer their benediction over [its bounties] to the Great Name, assuring thereby the existence of the world, but if that is not done, the Great Name is raised on high and the Divine Presence is removed from Israel, and surely this happens all the more so when a person offers his seed to the Molech, and thereby causes that He <i>abhor the pride of Jacob</i><sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 6:8.</i> and His dwelling place [i.e., the Sanctuary]. This is the meaning of the expression, <i>the people of the Land shall stone him with stones</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 2.</i> for He did not say: “he shall surely be put to death; they shall stone him with stones,” as is mentioned in all such cases,<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 27: <i>they shall surely be put to death; they shall stone them with stones</i>. Also <i>ibid.</i>, 24:16.</i> but instead mentions <i>the people of the Land</i>, meaning to say that all the people of the Land — all Israel — are obliged to precede to stone him, for [having given of his seed to Molech] he has harmed everybody, because he has caused that the Divine Presence be removed from Israel. It is for this reason that Onkelos translated [the expression, <i>the people of the Land</i>]: “the people of the house of Israel,” for the term <i>the Land</i> alludes to the whole Land of Israel, not merely the land wherein the worshipper [of the Molech] happens to reside, this being similar [to the expression], <i>for all the earth is Mine</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:5. See Ramban there (Vol. II, pp. 273-274).</i> The secret thereof you will also be able to understand from that which Scripture mentions with reference to [the punishment of] excision for worshipping the Molech, <i>I also will set My face against that man</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3 before us.</i> and again, <i>then will I set My face against that man</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> meaning that My Great and Fearful Name will cut him off. The word “I” He did not mention in the case of excision for practicing the sorcery of the <i>ov</i> or the <i>yide’oni</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 27.

Verse 4



Verse 5

TO GO ASTRAY AFTER THE MOLECH. “This is intended to include any other idol that was worshipped in that way [i.e., by a person passing his children through the fire], even if that particular idol is ordinarily not worshipped that way.” This is Rashi’s language. Now Rashi has already written in the section of <i>Acharei Moth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> that the Molech is “an idol the name of which is ‘Molech,’ and this was the way in which it was worshipped: he would hand over his child to the priests etc.” But all this does not conform and agree properly with the Gemara’s conclusion<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 a-b.</i> as it appears after deliberation. For according to the opinion of the Sage who says that Molech is an idol [and not a name for a form of witchcraft], the worship thereof was not by passing children through the fire, for if so there was no need at all for Scripture to mention this, [i.e., the passing through fire] since it would be included in the admonition against worshipping the idols [in the manner in which they are usually worshipped], of which there are many general prohibitions in the Torah, and it is also included in the punishment stated in the section <i>If there be found in the midst of thee … man or woman, that doeth that which is evil in the sight of the Eternal thy G-d, in transgressing His covenant, and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 17:2-3.</i> Rather, we must perforce interpret [if Molech is the name of a particular idol] that the essential purpose of Scripture in mentioning [this particular form of worship], was only to make one liable for passing one’s children [through fire] even if that particular idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner. And thus the Rabbis have said in the Gemara:<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 a-b.</i> “And according to the Sage who is of the opinion that Molech is an idol, why did Scripture state [the punishment of] excision in the case of Molech [when it is already included in the general punishment for all idol-worship]? It is to apply it in the case of one who passes his son [through the fire in honor of any idol, even if that idol is] not ordinarily worshipped in that manner.” And the same reasoning applies to the punishment and the admonition which Scripture mentioned with reference to it [this particular form of worship], that they were only necessary [if we hold that Molech is an idol] for the case of one who passed his son [through fire] to an idol which is not normally worshipped in that manner.<br>It would appear that according to this opinion [that the Molech was idol-worship, and that the main reason why Scripture mentioned this particular form of worship was to prohibit and punish the practice thereof even as an abnormal manner of worship of all other idols], that the term “Molech” is not a name for a particular graven image or statute, but is a general name for anything that is worshipped, “anything which you accept as your king and take upon you as your god.” In accordance with this opinion, the children of Ammon called their abhorrence Molech,<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 11:7. The word “abhorrence” is the term of the Rabbis for idols, which we are to abhor. See Deuteronomy 7:26.</i> because he was their king, the term Molech thus being a general name for all things honored [as deities], for it is derived from the term <i>malchuth</i> (royalty). It is thus not like the Rabbi [Rashi] said [in the preceding section of <i>Acharei Moth</i>], that Molech is “an idol the name of which is ‘Molech,’ and the manner of its worship” was as mentioned. Similarly, that which Rashi wrote here that the phrase <i>to go astray after the Molech</i> “is necessary to include any other idol that was worshipped in that way, even if that particular idol is ordinarily not worshipped in that way” — this interpretation too, is impossible [to accept] for the reason that we have mentioned, namely, that the essential basis for the punishment of excision mentioned specifically in the case of the Molech, is to make one liable for practicing before an idol even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, and this includes all idols! [Hence it is not necessary to include them on the basis of the phrase before us in Verse 5 — <i>to go astray after the Molech</i> — when this point is already established the overall statement of excision mentioned in Verse 3 which essentially prohibits that kind of worship to any idol, even if it is not normally worshipped in that way]! It is also impossible to say that Scripture made one liable to excision in the case of that idol the name of which is “Molech,” although passing a child through the fire before it was not its usual mode of worship, and that then it reverts [in the verse before us, stating <i>to go astray after Molech</i>, in order, as Rashi said] to include in the punishment of excision he [who passes through the fire of his seed] to Peor or Merkulis [which was also an abnormal mode of worshipping them]. For why was it necessary for Scripture to mention it [i.e., Molech] altogether? Why was that idol [called “Molech” or “Peor” or “Merkulis”] different from all other idols [since the Torah has already prohibited passing one’s children through fire before any idol, under punishment of excision even if that particular idol is ordinarily not worshipped that way]? Moreover, if so you would need a special verse to include one who passes his child through the fire to Peor or Merkulis in the punishment of stoning [if there were witnesses to his act and he was given the proper warning], just as Scripture [according to Rashi] included him in the punishment of excision [when there were no witnesses]!<br>Rather, [we must conclude] that Scripture only mentioned the admonition, and the punishments of excision and stoning, in the case of Molech, with reference to one who passes his child through the fire to any idol whatsoever, even if that is not its usual mode of worship. Thus whether you say that the term Molech is a name for all idols [since the name is derived from the word <i>malchuth</i>, (royalty)] as we have explained, or whether you say [as Rashi does] that Molech is the name of a particular idol that was so called, [we must say, as explained above] that Scripture mentioned it [in order to prohibit this practice even] if it be an abnormal mode of worship [of that idol, i.e., Molech]; the same law applying to all idols, for this stringency is on account of the frightfulness of this mode of worship. All this is made clear in the Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 a-b.</i> according to this opinion which the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, that the Molech was an idol. But our Mishnah [which mentions first “the idolator” and then “he that offers of his seed to Molech,” thus indicating that Molech is not an idol, for otherwise this would have been included under the law of “the idolator”],<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">This point is clearly made in the Gemara in Sanhedrin 64 a, in commenting on the Mishnah.</i> is taught in accordance with the opinion of the Sage who says that Molech was not an idol, meaning to say, it was not worshipped in a manner of being accepted as a god, but instead it was like a practice of witchcraft, to <i>seek on behalf of the living unto the dead</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 8:19.</i> unto <i>this dead dog</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 16:9.</i> According to this opinion, one who passed his seed through the fire to Peor or Merkulis, is not liable [since that form of witchcraft was performed only before Molech, and the Torah specifically mentioned that this practice of witchcraft was done before Molech].<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">If Molech is held to have been an idol, then, as explained in Ramban above, there was no need for the Torah to prohibit and punish its practice specifically, since it was included in the many general prohibitions against idolatry. We were therefore forced to say that the reason why the Torah specifically mentioned Molech and its practice, was to prohibit that practice to any idol, even if that particular idol was not normally worshipped in that way. Also, the term “Molech” must be an expression not for a particular idol, but for any idol, the word being of the root <i>malchuth</i> (royalty), as the act of idol worship meant that the idolator accepted the idol as his god. But if Molech is held to have been a form of witchcraft [and not a mode of idol worship], then if one is to perform that practice before Peor or Merkulis, it would not come under that specific prohibition which the Torah singled out, and hence he would be free from the punishment of death, although — needless to state — he has committed a heinous sin.</i> Rashi’s words in his commentaries to Tractate Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, Sanhedrin 64 a. See my Hebrew commentary p. 129, where this text of Rashi is quoted.</i> are also as we have written. And the Beraitha taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 10:15.</i> [which was the source for Rashi’s comment mentioned at the beginning of this verse]: “<i>And I will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to go astray after Molech</i>. This is intended to include the case of any other idol [which was worshipped in that way, that the worshipper is liable to the punishment of] excision” — the interpretation of this Beraitha is not based upon the redundant expression <i>to go astray after Molech</i>, as appears from the words of the Rabbi [Rashi]. Rather, the Beraitha is stating that this whole [Scriptural passage laying down the law of] excision is redundant, and therefore we are to apply it to any other idol that was worshipped in that way. It is this which the Rabbis have stated in the Gemara:<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 64 b.</i> “Why is excision mentioned thrice [as the punishment] for idolatry?<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 3 and 5 here; Numbers 15:31.</i> It is prescribed once for [worshipping an idol in] the customary manner; once for worshipping it in a non-customary manner,” that is, if he sacrifices, or burns incense, or pours a libation, or bows down before an idol,<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 4-6, that these four modes of worship are forbidden to be done before any idol, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner.</i> which have been included under the punishment of death<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:19: <i>He that sacrificeth unto the gods shall be utterly destroyed</i>. And see “The Commandments,” Vol. II, p. 6.</i> even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, and here [in the verse before us] they are made liable to excision [in the absence of witnesses]. “And once excision is mentioned for [the worship of] Molech” [for Molech is <i>not</i> an idol, but a form of witchcraft which the Torah prohibited by means of this strong form of punishment]. And according to the Sage who says that Molech <i>is</i> an idol [we must perforce say that the reason why the Torah singled out the Molech is in order to prohibit and punish] passing a child through the fire before any idol whatever, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner, as we have mentioned.

FOR WHATSOEVER MAN THERE BE THAT CURSETH HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER. The meaning thereof is that it refers back to the beginning of the section where He stated, <i>Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 19:3.</i> and He now states here, <i>for whatsoever man there be</i> that does not obey [this commandment] and <i>curseth his father, or his mother, he shall surely be put to death</i>, and by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], this verse is here stated because He had said [above], <i>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and by ye holy; for I am the Eternal your G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> and <i>I am the Eternal Who sanctify you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8.</i> meaning that it is <i>the Glorious Name</i><sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:58.</i> Who sanctifies us, for He is <i>our Father</i>, and <i>our Redeemer from everlasting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 63:16.</i> and it is His Name; therefore he who curses those who participated in his formation, is liable to death. This is the reason for the law [of the punishment] of the adulterer and adulteress, [in the following verse], which He placed near here before [the law of] all forbidden relations [mentioned further on in this section].<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s meaning, as clearly indicated by his commentary (see following note) is that as a result of committing adultery the children of the union may come to transgress the laws relating to parental honor, as they will not know who their fathers are. It is for this reason that the law of the adulterer and adulteress is identical to that of one who curses his parents [who is liable to death by the hand of the court], as the one leads to the other, and therefore too, it is mentioned in juxtaposition to that law.</i> I have already alluded to this above.<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:13 (Vol. II, p. 320).</i><br>Now Scripture mentions here some of the forbidden relations in order to make [one who has intercourse with them] liable to death, these being a man’s wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 10.</i> a father’s wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> a daughter-in-law,<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12.</i> a male,<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> a woman and her mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> and the same law applies to a woman and her daughter and her daughter’s daughter, for He mentioned here only some of the relations of a wife, but the same punishment applies to all those mentioned there<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 18:17.</i> in the admonition. And surely this applies all the more so to one’s own relatives, such as his son’s daughter and his daughter’s daughter mentioned there,<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> and needless to say, his [own] daughter. On all these matters there are also Rabbinical interpretations to establish their punishment. Similarly He mentioned here the punishment of death for lying with a beast.<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> He mentioned excision again in the case of a menstruant<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> [although this has already been included in a general statement above, 18:29], in order to declare him liable for mere sexual contact without completion of the act, this being the sense of the expression, <i>he hath bared her fountain</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> Similarly [He has stated] in the case of a mother’s sister and a father’s sister, <i>for he hath bared his near kin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i> He mentioned an uncle’s wife<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i> and also a brother’s wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> in order to declare them liable to [the punishment of] dying childless, whether he had no children at the time when he commits the sin, or he did have [in which case none will survive him].

AND IF A MAN ‘YIKACH’ (SHALL TAKE) HIS SISTER. Scripture mentions the term <i>kichah</i> [“taking,” which generally denotes the taking of a woman as a wife] in the case of a sister, although betrothal to her is not valid, because a brother and sister sleep together in one house, and when his desire overpowers him, he takes her and draws her to himself, and he does not have to come to her as one does to a woman who is a harlot. Similarly it is the way of Scripture to use the term “taking” in the case of all those with whom one remains alone, for a wife and her mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> [a wife] and her son’s daughter and her daughter’s daughter,<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 18:17.</i> a wife and her sister,<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 18.</i> and a brother’s wife<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 21.</i> are all [found] with him in one house [hence Scripture uses the term “taking” in each of these cases]. For a similar reason Scripture uses this expression in the following verse, <i>A man shall not ‘take’ his father’s wife</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 23:1.</i> The expression <i>and he see her nakedness</i> is an euphemism, since Scripture modifies its expression in speaking of forbidden relationships. Sometimes it calls sexual intercourse “uncovering of nakedness,” as it says in the case of most of the forbidden women, <i>thou shalt not uncover her nakedness</i>, for it is the way of those who commit fornication to uncover her skirts, similar to that which is said, <i>and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Nahum 3:5.</i> and at times it calls it “entering,” thus: <i>If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:13.</i> <i>to come in unto us;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 19:31.</i> <i>and he came in unto her, and she conceived by him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:18.</i> Many times Scripture calls it “lying,” and here it refers to it as “seeing,” since brother and sister lodge together and there is no need for uncovering of skirts. Similarly Scripture uses the euphemism “knowing,” as in the following expressions: <i>And the man knew Eve his wife;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:1.</i> <i>and he knew her again no more;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:26.</i> <i>a virgin, neither had any man known her</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:16.</i> And Scripture states [here in the verse before us] <i>and she see his nakedness</i>, meaning to say that she too desired his nakedness in her heart and consented thereto. Now it mentions these expressions only in the case of a sister, because in all forbidden relations when a man approaches a woman for the purpose of uncovering her nakedness, it is generally with her consent, and otherwise she can remove herself from him and cry for help, but in the case of a brother [and sister] who lodge together, it may be that it was done without her knowledge, and therefore Scripture mentioned that she too “saw his nakedness.”
IT IS ‘CHESED.’ In the opinion of the commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi and R’dak (in Sefer Hashorashim, root <i>chesed</i>).</i> <i>chesed</i> here means “shame,” because all people will naturally be ashamed of this ugly sin, this being used here as in the Aramaic language, for Onkelos translated, <i>for that were ‘a disgrace’ unto us</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 34:14.</i> “for that were <i>chisudo</i> unto us.” Yonathan ben Uziel also translated <i>and I will lay it for ‘a reproach,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 11:2.</i> “[and I will lay it for] <i>chisudo</i>.” And in the language of the Sages [we find]:<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth Rabbah 7:11.</i> “Because <i>shechasdo</i> (he shamed him) in public.” Similarly, <i>lest he that heareth it ‘y’chasedcha’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 25:10.</i> means “lest he cause you shame upon your revealing the secret of another.”<br><i>And they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people</i>. The intention thereof is as follows: “You have done this secretly, but G-d will reveal your sin by bringing upon you a punishment before all the children of your people.” He mentioned this with reference to a sin which is done in utmost secrecy, but it applies as well to all [sins punishable by] excision, as I have mentioned. <i>He hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</i>. This means that if he had uncovered his sister’s nakedness against her will, he alone shall bear his iniquity, as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented. But in my opinion the expression <i>he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</i> means that each one of those mentioned [will bear the iniquity], just like the expression <i>for he hath made naked his near kin; they shall bear their iniquity</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i><br>The correct interpretation of the word <i>chesed</i> [<i>it is ‘chesed’</i>] appears to me to be according to its plain sense [“goodness,” “kindness”]. So also is the opinion of our Rabbis.<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Kedoshim</i> 11:9. “<i>It is ‘chesed.’</i> And if you should say: ‘But Cain did marry his sister!’ It is for this reason that Scripture states, <i>it is ‘chesed’</i> [<i>an act of kindness</i> — done by the Creator in order that the world be built up], for the world from its very start was created only by kindness, as it is said, <i>The world was built up through kindness</i>” (Psalms 89:3).</i> The verse is thus stating that the brother’s kinship is kindness,<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a brother’s kinship to his sister should express itself in kindness, as that is the essence of kinship, whereas he has acted to the contrary.</i> and it is not proper for the uncovering of nakedness. Thus in the case of other relations Scripture mentions that the reason [for the prohibition of sexual intercourse] is because they are next of kin, but in the case of a brother [and sister] it mentions as the reason the kindness which should be among them. The word <i>ish</i> [<i>and if ‘a man’ shall take his sister</i>] thus draws along with it a similar word [so that the expression <i>it is ‘chesed’</i> becomes “it is <i>ish chesed</i>,” meaning: “it is a man who should have acted kindly to her, but he did the contrary, and hence his punishment is severe”]. Or it may be that [the expression <i>it is ‘chesed’</i>] is like: <i>and I am prayer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 109:4.</i> [which means: “and I am ‘a man of’ prayer”<i>; for thou art precious things</i><sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 9:23.</i> [which means: “for thou art ‘a man of’ precious things”]<i>; Behold, I am against thee, O arrogance</i><sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 50:31.</i> [which means: “‘man of’ arrogance”], in all of which cases the word <i>ish</i> (man) is missing [and here too that word is omitted, as if it were to say: “it is <i>ish chesed</i>,” as explained above]. Or it may be that Scripture in these cases refers to these men by their qualities [as if to say, “kindness personifies the brother,” “I am all prayer,” “he is all preciousness,” or “arrogance personified”. Thus Scripture is stating, <i>And if a man shall take his sister … and see her nakedness … he is</i> [to have been] <i>the man of kindness, and they shall be cut off</i>, for <i>he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity</i>. Thus He mentioned that the brother should have been <i>the merciful man who doeth good to his own soul</i>, but <i>he was cruel and troubled his own flesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 11:17.</i> For he should have done the kindness to her that brothers do, to give her in marriage to a husband, but he blemished and troubled her. Scripture ascribes the fault in such cases to the male, just as it is said, <i>he hath uncovered his brother’s</i> [wife’s] <i>nakedness; they shall be childless</i><sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> [and likewise here too it states, <i>‘he’ hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness</i>]. Similarly it is my opinion that the expression, <i>lest he that heareth it ‘y’chasedcha’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 25:10.</i> means “lest he that hears it will remove from you all kindness, because you have not shown kindness to your friend who entrusted you with his secret.” [The word <i>y’chasedcha</i> here meaning “remove <i>kindness</i>”] is like: <i>l’dashno</i><sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 27:3.</i> [the root of which <i>deshen</i> in its primary sense means “to <i>cover with</i> ashes,” but also has the opposite meaning of “<i>removing</i> the ashes”]<i>; and all mine increase ‘t’shareish’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">Job 31:12.</i> [which, in its ordinary form, would mean “to take root,” but also has the opposite meaning of “rooting out”], and similar cases. [Likewise, <i>y’chasedcha</i> which is of the root <i>chesed</i>, kindness, means in the verse quoted “remove kindness,” and does not mean “shame.”] For it appears to me unlikely that the word <i>chesed</i> in the Sacred Language should bear such opposite meanings [as “kindness” and “shame”], when Scriptural texts abound in the praise of <i>chesed</i> and use it in prayers. The term <i>chisudo</i>, however, in Aramaic is another matter. Even that language differentiates between the two usages; “kindness” is translated <i>chisdo</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 39:21: <i>and He showed him ‘chased’</i> Onkelos translates: “and He showed him [Joseph] <i>chisdo</i>” (mercy, kindness).</i> and “shame” is translated <i>chisudo</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">As Onkelos translated in Genesis 34:14 [mentioned above].</i> Now Rabbeinu Chananel<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus, Vol. II, p. 106, Note 45, on Rabbeinu Chananel. It is of interest here to add that in view of the fact that Ramban quotes an interpretation of Rabbeinu Chananel on a verse in the Book of Proverbs, it would seem to indicate that Rabbeinu Chananel’s exegetic activity extended also to the Scriptural books in the division of the Writings, in addition to those on the Pentateuch and the Prophets. See my introduction to “Peirushei Rabbeinu Chananel al Ha’torah,” Mosad Harav Kook, 1972.</i> wrote that <i>‘chesed’ to any people is sin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 14:34.</i> means “reproach” [i.e., that sin is “a reproach” to any people]. But in my opinion this too is an expression of contrast [as will be explained]. For “righteousness” and <i>chesed</i> are mentioned in that verse [thus: <i>Righteousness exalteth a nation, but ‘chesed’ to any people is sin</i>], these being twin terms mentioned in all places, as for example: <i>he that followeth after righteousness and ‘chesed;’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:21.</i> <i>that I am the Eternal who exercises ‘chesed,’ justice, and righteousness in the earth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 9:23.</i> Rather, the meaning of the verse in my opinion is as follows: “<i>Righteousness</i> if practiced <i>exalteth a nation</i>, but <i>‘chesed’</i> (mercy, kindness) <i>is a reproach to any people</i> if it fails to practice it.” Thus the verse is stating that upon righteousness and mercy depends the elevation or the decline of any people. Or it may be [that the verse is] stating: “Righteousness exalts any individual nation that practices it, while many nations sin by their failure to do mercy.” A similar example of such a verse is the one immediately preceding it: <i>In the heart of him that hath discernment, wisdom resteth; but in the inward part of fools it maketh itself known</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 14:33.</i> the meaning of which is that “it makes itself known that [wisdom] is not there,” for all who see them recognize by their deeds that they are fools <i>and there is no understanding in them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:28.</i> These two verses [thus express their thoughts in their second half] in a negative manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote">Thus: <i>Mercy is a reproach to any people</i> if it does not practice it. <i>In the inward part of fools it makes itself known</i> that wisdom does not rest therein.</i><br>Emor

Chapter 21



Verse 1

SAY [UNTO THE PRIESTS] … AND THOU SHALT SAY UNTO THEM. “[The repetition of the verb <i>say … and thou shalt say</i> is] to warn the adults about the children” [that they observe this law]. This is Rashi’s language on the basis of the words of our Rabbis.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 114 a.</i> Now the meaning of this “warning” is to state that we are not to assist with our hands in the defilement of children [but it does not intend to warn us that we are obliged to prevent them from becoming defiled]. There are many admonitions in the Torah of this nature according to the interpretation of our Rabbis,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 114 a.</i> such being the prohibitions against eating blood and swarming things, and against the defilement [of priests], and from them we learn that [it is applicable to] all prohibitions of the Torah, that we must not assist children in any case to transgress the law. But if they are doing it of their own accord, we<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the court. But his father is obliged to rebuke him and prevent him from doing that which is forbidden (<i>ibid.</i>, and such is the final decision of the law, Shulchan Aruch, <i>Hilchoth Shabbath</i>, 343).</i> are not commanded to prevent them [from so doing since they have not yet reached the training period of minors for religious practices, but if they have reached that stage, everyone is commanded to prevent them from doing a prohibited act].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Shulchan Aruch <i>ibid.</i>, Rama, and Mishnah Brurah, 7.</i> The meaning of the verse according to its interpretation is then: “<i>say unto the priests … and thou shalt say</i> it over again to them, that they are not to defile themselves,” the purpose of the many warnings being [to teach] that all sons of Aaron are to be guarded from defilement, even the young ones. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, that <i>say unto the priests</i> refers to the section mentioned above [i.e., <i>Seder Kedoshim</i>], since they [the priests] are the teachers of the Torah and it is they who admonish the people; <i>and thou shalt say unto them</i>, meaning those specific commandments which devolve upon them alone to observe, [as mentioned in this section]. But it is not correct [to interpret two such adjacent phrases as referring to two different sections].<br>In my opinion the plain sense of the verse is as follows: The meaning of <i>emor</i> (say) is like that of <i>dabeir</i> (speak): <i>Give ear to ‘amarai,’</i> O Eternal<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 5:2.</i> is like <i>d’varai</i> (my words). A similar case is <i>‘imrei’</i>(<i>words of</i>) <i>truth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 22:21. This is equivalent to <i>‘divrei’ emeth</i> (words of truth) — Ecclesiastes 12:10.</i> So also: <i>for it hath heard all ‘imrei’</i> (<i>the words of</i>) <i>the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 24:27. Here too it is like <i>‘divrei’ Hashem</i> (the words of G-d) in Exodus 24:3.</i> And the expression <i>Go in unto Pharaoh ‘v’dibarta’</i> (<i>and thou shalt speak</i>) <i>to him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 9:1.</i> is like <i>v’amarta</i> (and thou shalt say). <i>‘Vayedabeir Mosheh’</i> (<i>And Moses spoke</i>) <i>unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: ‘Take the meal-offering</i>,’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 10:12.</i> is like <i>vayomer Mosheh</i> (<i>and Moses said</i>). And so also you find in many places that both [<i>amor</i> and <i>dabeir</i> are used in one verse, such as:] <i>‘Dabeir</i> (<i>Speak</i>) <i>unto the children of Israel, ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and say</i>) <i>unto them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:38.</i> such usage [of the two verbs] being found in those sections where He wishes to warn them strongly [about a certain law] either because of the stringency of the matter, or on account of their habit to commit that sin. Thus <i>‘emor’</i> (<i>say</i>) <i>unto the priests … ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and thou shalt say</i>) <i>unto them</i> [is like <i>‘dabeir’</i> (<i>speak unto the priests</i>) <i>‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and thou shalt say</i>), as will be explained further on]. Similarly, <i>Thus saith the Eternal, the G-d of Israel: Go ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and say</i>) <i>to Zedekiah king of Judah ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and say</i>) <i>unto him: Thus saith the Eternal</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 34:2.</i> means “Go <i>dabeir</i> (speak) to Zedekiah.” Similarly, <i>‘Vatomer ha’ishah ha’t'ko’ith’</i> (<i>And when the woman of Tekoa said</i>) <i>to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself, ‘vatomer’</i> (<i>and she said</i>)<i>: ‘Help, O king’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 14:4.</i> is like: “<i>vatedabei’r ha’ishah</i> (<i>and the woman spoke</i>) to the king <i>vatomer</i> (<i>and she said</i>), ‘Help, O king.’” The meaning of <i>Say unto the priests … and thou shalt say unto them</i> is thus like “speak to the priests and say to them,” similar to [that which we find elsewhere], <i>‘Dabeir’</i> (<i>speak</i>) <i>unto the children of Israel, ‘v’amarta’</i> (<i>and say</i>) <i>unto them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:38.</i> the meaning thereof being: “speak to the people in My Name, and say thus to them,” like, <i>Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him:</i> [<i>‘Thus saith the Eternal: Let My people go’</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 7:26. — In brief, Ramban up to this point has explained that there is no difference between <i>emor</i> and <i>dabeir</i>, and that the double use of each of these verbs or the use of the two together is to indicate the importance of the subject discussed. I have found a similar view in Yonah ibn Ganach’s Sefer Hashorashim, root <i>dabeir</i>.</i> Now many scholars<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I have not identified these scholars.</i> say that the meaning of <i>‘dabeir’ unto the children of Israel</i> is like that of the term <i>kriah</i> (calling), thus: “call unto the children of Israel that they assemble themselves before you, and you shall say to them the following,” and similarly <i>‘emor’ to the priests</i> means [“call them] to assemble themselves and to listen.”<br>[SAY UNTO] THE PRIESTS. The reason for [His mentioning the term] <i>the priests</i> [in this section is as follows]: In commandments relating to matters of the offerings He says, <i>Command Aaron and his sons</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 6:2. Or: <i>Speak unto Aaron and his sons</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 18).</i> and does not refer to them by the name “the priests,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">“The priests.” In the Tur quoting Ramban: “and He does not refer to them by the term of priesthood.”</i> because those subjects concern the offerings or the various degrees of holiness of the Sanctuary. But here He warns the priests that they should never defile themselves for the dead, even at a time when they do not come into the Sanctuary, this being a mark of distinction to them personally; therefore Scripture mentioned here <i>the priests</i>, meaning to say that it is because they are the priests of the Eternal and the ministers of our G-d that He told them to conduct themselves in a manner reflecting honor and greatness, and that they should never become defiled. Thus the priests who are unfit for the priesthood [i.e., those who are born from a marriage forbidden to their father], are excluded from this principle [i.e., they are permitted to defile themselves for the dead].<br>The explanation of <i>‘lo yitama’</i> (<i>he shall not defile himself</i> — in the singular) is that you [i.e., Moses] are to tell the priests that none of them is to defile himself for the dead among his people. Or it may be that [the use of the singular in <i>lo yitama</i>] is connected with the expression of <i>‘ba’al b’amav’</i> (<i>a chief man among his people</i>) mentioned below in Scripture,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> and the meaning thereof [here] is: “the chief man among his people is not to defile himself [for the dead].” And the meaning of <i>ba’al b’amav</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> is like the expressions: <i>‘miba’alei Yehudah;’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 6:2.</i> <i>‘ba’aleigoyim,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 16:8.</i> namely “the dignitaries” or “the lords” among them [i.e., Judah<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 6:2.</i> and the nations<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 16:8.</i>], similar to the phrase: <i>‘ba’alav ein imo’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:13.</i> — “the master is not with it; “<i>‘ba’al habayith’</i> — “the master of the house;” as honored people are called “lords.” The verse here is thus stating: “the honored one among his people [i.e., the priest] is not to defile himself for the dead, [in which case] he would be treating his honor with irreverence.” Scripture is thus explaining that it is because of the distinction of the priest, seeing that he is fit to become the highest and most honored one among his people [i.e., the High Priest] that it warns him not to profane his distinction with the impurity of the dead. By means of this statement, Scripture intends to teach us that it should not occur to us to say that the warning [against the priests defiling themselves for the dead] is only when they come into the Tent of Meeting to perform the holy Service. Similarly in this whole section He states that all restrictions [on the priests mentioned here] are due to their distinction. Thus: <i>she profaneth her father;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 9.</i> <i>and he shall not profane his seed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> Onkelos likewise translated [Verse 4]: “The chief among his people shall not defile himself, to be profaned thereby.” But in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 1:15.</i> [<i>ba’al b’amav</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> is interpreted [literally] to refer to “a husband” with reference to his wife, as Rashi has written.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Thus: “A husband [a priest] shall not defile himself for his wife’s corpse while it is among his people, meaning where there are other persons who can attend to her burial, this applying only to a wife who disqualified him from serving as a priest, because she was forbidden to him in marriage.” But otherwise the priest is to defile himself for his wife, even if there are other people to attend to her burial.</i>

Verse 11



Verse 12

NEITHER SHALL HE GO OUT OF THE SANCTUARY. “He does not follow the bier [of a near relative]. Our Rabbis have further derived from this verse [the principle] that the High Priest may perform [the Divine Service] when he is an <i>onen</i> (a mourner),<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Seder Shemini</i>, Note 85.</i> the meaning of the verse thus being as follows: Even if his father or his mother died, he need not leave the Sanctuary but he may perform the Service. <i>Nor shall he profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</i>, means that [the High Priest] does not profane thereby the Service by ministering when he is an <i>onen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Seder Shemini</i>, Note 85.</i> since Scripture permitted him to minister. From this you deduce that a common priest who officiated when he is an <i>onen</i>, does profane the Service.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But these two interpretations [that Rashi mentioned, namely, that the High Priest is not to follow the bier of a near relative, and that he may officiate when he is an <i>onen</i>], are really opposing opinions, for since the verse <i>permitted</i> the High Priest not to leave the Sanctuary on account of his mourning, as a common priest must do, but instead he may [continue to] officiate when he is an <i>onen</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Seder Shemini</i>, Note 85.</i> then there is <i>no admonition here</i> against his following the bier of his near relative.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">To understand Ramban’s criticism of Rashi’s interpretation, it is necessary to recall the difference between a statement which is a mere negation and one which is a prohibition. “An admonition is in the nature of a charge; it is in fact the verb in its command-form” (“The Commandments,” Vol. II, p. 391). But a statement of negation merely excludes a particular case from a certain subject (see further, Ramban Vol. II, p. 350, Note 71). Now the verse before us reads, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</i>. In interpreting the phrase, <i>neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</i> as a prohibition, meaning that <i>he is not permitted</i> to leave the Sanctuary to follow the bier, how could Rashi continue on the basis of <i>the same phrase</i> to state that <i>he need not</i> leave the Sanctuary, but he may perform the Service, since these two interpretations of the same phrase are contradictory to each other! This is the meaning of Ramban’s succinct objection: “Since the verse <i>permitted</i> the High Priest … then there is <i>no admonition</i> …” Mizrachi, in defense of Rashi, answers that Rashi was not referring only to the first phrase [as if both the permission and the admonition are derived from the same phrase], but rather to both phrases of the verse, the first one [<i>neither shall he go out</i> …] establishing the prohibition, and the second one [<i>nor profane</i> …] constituting the negation. Ramban will also further on defend Rashi’s position from another standpoint.</i> Similarly, <i>nor shall he profane the Sanctuary of his G-d</i> is, according to this interpretation [of Rashi], nothing but a statement that the Service of the High Priest does not become profaned [although performed when he is an <i>onen</i>], from which you are to deduce that a common priest who officiates when he is an <i>onen</i>, does defile the Service. But if so, this verse is merely a negation, not a prohibition, and yet the “masters of the <i>Halachoth</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">“Masters of the <i>Halachoth</i>.” From the ensuing phrase [“counted it among the negative commandments in the Hilchoth Gedoloth”], it is obvious that Ramban is referring to one particular work. But if so, why does he speak of “the masters” [in the plural] of that work? It may be that this is because it has long been in doubt whether the authorship of that book is to be ascribed to Rav Yehudai Gaon or to Rabbi Shimon Kairo, or to both. Hence Ramban writes here “the masters of the <i>Halachoth</i>.” See, however, in Exodus 21:7, where Ramban writes of “the master of the Hilchoth Gedoloth” — in the singular. See Vol. II, p. 350, Note 70.</i> counted it among the negative commandments in the Hilchoth Gedoloth! Moreover, I have already quoted the Beraitha<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">For the meaning of this term, see in Exodus, <i>Seder Bo</i>, Note 209.</i> which is taught in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 42. Ramban quoted it above, 10:6.</i> where it is clearly explained that this verse is a proper prohibition [and not a mere negation], as it is taught: “<i>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 8:33.</i> I might think that [upon becoming apprised of the death of a near relative, an ordinary priest may not leave the Sanctuary] whether he is ministering or not; Scripture therefore says, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor shall he profane</i>. When is he not permitted to go out [so that only by his staying there] he does not profane it? I must say that this applies only when he is ministering.” And it further states there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Shemini Milu’im</i> 43.</i> “I would only know that this tells me that Aaron and his sons, who were anointed with the oil of anointment, are liable to death [by the hand of Heaven] if they leave the Sanctuary while they are ministering. How do I know that this [prohibition] applies also to all priests of all times? etc.” Thus it is clear that the verse before us constitutes an actual negative commandment, prohibiting the priest from leaving the Service and going out [of the Sanctuary].<br>Therefore I say in order to maintain the words of all the Sages [i.e., of Rashi and of the author of the Hilchoth Gedoloth, as will be explained], that the main purpose of this verse is to admonish the High Priest not to leave the Sanctuary while he is ministering, on [becoming apprised of] the death of any near relative, and he is not to profane the Sanctuary by leaving its Service for the honor of the dead. Instead, the honor of the Sanctuary and its Service is to be greater to him than his honor of and love for the dead, and it follows all the more so that if he left his ministration for no reason at all, and went out of the Sanctuary, that he has violated this negative commandment. However, Scripture warned him with [especial] reference to the dead, in order [incidentally] to permit the High Priest to perform the Service when he is an <i>onen</i> (a mourner),<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Seder Shemini</i>, Note 85.</i> and since it is permissible for him to perform it, therefore if he leaves it voluntarily it constitutes a profanation of the Sanctuary. This is the meaning of this verse, and I have already written it in the section of <i>Vay’hi Bayom Ha’shemini</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Above 10:6.</i><br>We find furthermore that our Rabbis have differed in the second chapter of Tractate Zebachim [on this matter, namely whether the verse before us is a prohibition, or a mere negation]. Thus they have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Zebachim 16 a.</i> “How do we know that an <i>onen</i> [who performs] profanes the Service? Because it is written, <i>Neither shall he</i> [i.e., the High Priest] <i>go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane;</i> but any other priest who does not go out [of the Sanctuary], does profane it [i.e., if he officiates when he is an <i>onen</i>]. And Rabbi Ilai<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Rabbi Eleazar.</i> said, We derive it from this verse: <i>Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 10:19. The verse refers to the day when Aaron’s two sons — Nadab and Abihu — died, and Aaron the High Priest performed the Service on that day. When Moses was angry with Elazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s two remaining sons, for not eating a certain offering as required, but burning it instead, Aaron intervened by replying: “Did <i>they</i> perform the rites of the offerings? It was <i>I</i>, the High Priest, who ministered, and the High Priest may indeed minister whilst an <i>onen</i>. And as for the reason why that offering was burnt etc.” (see above, 10:19).</i> — it is ‘I’ [Aaron — the High Priest] who offered! From this you may learn that if they [Aaron’s sons — Elazar and Ithamar] had performed the rites of the offerings, they would have acted correctly [in burning them, since common priests who minister when in a state of <i>aninuth</i> (mourning) invalidate the Service] etc. And Rabbi Ilai, why does he not derive this principle from the verse, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary, nor profane?</i> He will answer you: Is it after all written, ‘But any other priest who does not go out of the Sanctuary does profane it’?” The meaning of [Rabbi Ilai’s answer] is that since Scripture states an admonition with reference to the High Priest, that he is not to leave the Sanctuary and that he should not profane the Service by leaving it [on becoming apprised of the death of a near relative], there is no implication here that a common priest <i>does</i> profane the Service if he officiates when he is an <i>onen</i> [and hence Rabbi Ilai resorted to another verse — <i>Behold, this day</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 10:19. The verse refers to the day when Aaron’s two sons — Nadab and Abihu — died, and Aaron the High Priest performed the Service on that day. When Moses was angry with Elazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s two remaining sons, for not eating a certain offering as required, but burning it instead, Aaron intervened by replying: “Did <i>they</i> perform the rites of the offerings? It was <i>I</i>, the High Priest, who ministered, and the High Priest may indeed minister whilst an <i>onen</i>. And as for the reason why that offering was burnt etc.” (see above, 10:19).</i> — from which he learned that a common priest who is an <i>onen</i> profanes the Service]. From this text, then, there is another proof that it is not [merely] a permission [that the Torah extended] to the High Priest, permitting him to perform the Service, and informing him that his ministration will not become profaned [as Rashi had stated it], for if that were the case, it <i>would</i> surely have followed that a common priest does profane it by ministering [when he is an <i>onen</i>]. Thus it appears from the interpretation of the text,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The significance of this phrase of Ramban (“the interpretation of the text”), becomes clearer later on in the text, as another interpretation is offered by the author. At this point here Ramban is saying that the plain interpretation of the Beraitha shows that the First Sage agrees with Rashi’s view that the verse before us is a mere negation, and not an admonition to the High Priest (see following note).</i> that according to the opinion of the first answer [stated above, that we know that an <i>onen</i> profanes the Service from the verse about the High Priest, <i>Neither shall he go out</i> etc., which teaches by implication: “but any other priest who does not go out, does profane it”], it constitutes a mere negation as far as the High Priest is concerned,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s meaning is as follows: Since the First Sage of this Beraitha derives the <i>admonition</i> against a <i>common</i> priest ministering whilst in mourning from the verse about the High Priest [as explained in the text], this perforce shows that this Sage holds that with reference to the High Priest, the verse is a mere negation, and the reasoning is as follows: “Since Scripture states that the High Priest <i>need not</i> leave his ministration, we understand by implication that the common priest <i>must</i> leave it.” Thus with reference to the High Priest the verse is a mere negation, but, by implication, it is an admonition to the common priest. Rashi’s interpretation quoted at the beginning of this verse, that the verse is a negation, is thus justified and is in accord with the opinion of this Beraitha. — Thus far Ramban argued on the basis of the <i>interpretation</i> of the text of the Beraitha, that it substantiates <i>Rashi’s</i> position. Ramban will now turn his attention to the fact that a cursory reading of the Beraitha does convey the thought that the verse is <i>an admonition</i> to the High Priest, which is the opinion of the Hilchoth Gedoloth [as mentioned above], and he will explain the Beraitha accordingly. Thus Ramban has “validated the words of <i>all</i> the Sages” — Rashi and Hilchoth Gedoloth as he promised above in the text.</i> [to teach us] that he does not profane his Service [and invalidate it if he officiates whilst he is an <i>onen</i>], as is the language of Rashi. However, because in the Beraitha [quoted above] it is clearly stated that it is an admonition [an opinion held by the Hilchoth Gedoloth], we shall say that they<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">“They.” The reference may be to “the masters of the <i>Halachoth</i>” (see Note 30 above).</i> hold that since the admonition pertains only to the High Priest, and by implication we reason that a common priest does go out [of the Sanctuary] and leave the ministration, from this we learn that [if the common priest would continue ministering], the Service would be profaned, for if it would have been valid, [the Torah] would not have permitted him to leave it. And so it is taught in the Torath Kohanim in this section:<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 2:6.</i> “How do we know that if [the High Priest] officiates [whilst he is an <i>onen</i>] that his Service is valid? Because Scripture says, <i>Nor shall he profane</i>. But if a common priest officiates whilst in mourning, his Service <i>is</i> invalid.”<br>Now as to the text written in Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 18 a. — Ramban now quotes a text showing that the verse <i>‘Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary,’ prohibits</i> the High Priest from following the bier of his near relative, so that he should not become defiled thereby and thus “go out from his sanctity” (see Note 44 further). From this text it would then appear that the verse is <i>not</i> an admonition against his going out of the Sanctuary because of the honor of the <i>Service</i>, but because of the honor of his own sanctity, which would thus be a contradiction to what was said above. This, in short, is the intention of Ramban in quoting this text, and further on he will remove the difficulty.</i> “<i>Neither shall he go out ‘min hamikdash’</i> (<i>of the Sanctuary</i>) — this means that he may not follow after the bier with the bearers, but [he may go forth with them as long as they do not see one another, thus:] when they [who form the funeral cortege] are hidden [from his view, as when entering an alley], he [the High Priest] appears; when they emerge, he disappears [in the alley]. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yehudah says: He may not go forth from the Sanctuary at all, for it is said, <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</i>.” And [in the Gemara there] the Rabbis explained that the reason of Rabbi Meir is that he interprets the verse as follows: “<i>‘u’min hamikdash</i> — out of his sanctity — he shall not go forth,’<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">That is to say, he is to guard himself against being defiled by the dead. This implies that he <i>is</i> to follow the bier, but must guard himself against touching it or its bearers, and hence he must never be in sight of the funeral cortege.</i> and as long as he has some distinction [to remind him not to defile himself, namely, the fact that he is not in sight of the funeral cortege], he will not come to touch the dead. And Rabbi Yehudah [is of the opinion that] on account of his grief, he might by chance touch it.” [Now this whole text would seem to indicate that the verse before us is an admonition whose purpose is to guard the sanctity of the High Priest, and not, as we have said above, that its purpose is to guard the sanctity of the Service!] However, all this is merely a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance. It is they [i.e., the Rabbis] who [decided to] guard the dignity of the High Priest, that he should not go out after the bier, because he is not permitted to defile himself for near relatives; and since people are upset about their dead, [they feared] lest he will touch it, similar to that which is written, <i>And Joseph fell upon his father’s face</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 50:1.</i> But a common priest must defile himself for his near relatives, and he is not so upset about other people that there is a fear lest he defile himself; [therefore there was no need for the Rabbis to institute a restriction against a common priest following the funeral cortege of people other than his near relatives]. Thus it is clear that all this is a mark of distinction [for the High Priest] by law of the Rabbis, and they gave it support by reference to this verse, as is the manner of <i>asmachtoth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See in Exodus, p. 314, Note 449.</i> in the Talmud. So also have I found in the Tosephta of Sanhedrin:<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta, Sanhedrin 2:1. On “Tosephta” see above in <i>Seder Tazria</i>, Note 124.</i> “The Sages said to Rabbi Yehudah: The verse <i>Neither shall he go out of the Sanctuary</i>, only refers to his leaving the Sanctuary at the time of ministration.” There are also proofs in the Talmud Yerushalmi there,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi, Sanhedrin II, 1. On “Yerushalmi,” see above in <i>Seder Metzora</i>, Note 44.</i> [to the correctness of this explanation], but this is not the place to mention them.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In his comments to Rambam’s Sefer Hamitivoth, Principle Five, Ramban does quote this Yerushalmi at length.</i>

Verse 13

AND HE SHALL TAKE A WIFE IN HER VIRGINITY. This means that he is not to wed a woman who is not a virgin, this being a negative commandment which is derived from a positive commandment [which carries the force of a positive commandment].<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The intention of Ramban’s comment is that this verse is primarily intended to teach that the High Priest is <i>not</i> to marry a woman who is not a virgin. And the reason why it is stated in a positive form, is to make the negative aspect of it carry the force of a positive commandment, because it is an accepted principle that a negative commandment which is derived from a positive commandment carries only the force of a positive commandment. Therefore if he marries a woman who is not a virgin, he does not incur whipping, since the prohibition thereof is derived from a positive commandment, and only carries the force of a positive commandment, for the violation of which the court is not empowered to mete out punishment. This interpretation is made necessary by the following Verse 14, where it is stated again, <i>but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</i>. As Ramban will explain further on, it is this expression in Verse 14 which established the <i>positive</i> aspect thereof, while Verse 13 before us expresses the prohibitive part thereof. Thus the two verses are not redundant, but instead complement each other.</i> Afterwards [in the following verse] He forbids the High Priest by means of a negative commandment to marry a widow or other disqualified woman, and then says, <i>but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14. See preceding note.</i> thus commanding him [in a positive manner] to take a virgin as a wife. It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Horayoth 11 b.</i> “He is forbidden [to marry] a widow, and he is commanded to marry a virgin.” And so the Rabbis taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 2:6.</i> “<i>But a virgin</i>. This teaches that he is commanded to marry a virgin.”

Verse 14



Verse 15

AND HE SHALL NOT PROFANE HIS SEED AMONG HIS PEOPLE. “Thus if he married one of these women who are disqualified for him, his offspring from her becomes profaned [i.e., disqualified] from the law of the sanctity of the priesthood.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>The Rabbi [Rashi] thus explained the verse [before us] as a mere negation, meaning: “<i>these shall he not take</i> in order that he profane not his offspring.” But in the opinion of our Rabbis, this constitutes a second negative commandment. Thus they have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 78 a.</i> “If [a High Priest or a common priest] betrothed and had intercourse with one of the women disqualified to him, he is subject to two penalties of whipping, once on account of <i>he shall not take</i>, and again on account of <i>he shall not profane</i>.” And the Rabbis have also said there: “If he has intercourse without betrothal, he is liable to whipping on account of <i>he shall not profane</i>.” Thus it is clear that these are two negative commandments. They have also explained there the reason why, for [mere] betrothal without [subsequent] intercourse, he is not liable to whipping, because [Scripture says: <i>he shall not take … he shall not profane</i>, meaning:] Why must he not take [her as his wife]? “In order that he may not profane” [his offspring, and therefore if the marriage was not consummated, and he can have no offspring from her, he is not liable merely for the betrothal]. If so, the meaning of the expression, <i>these shall he not take</i>, is “because I [the Eternal] admonish him against profaning his seed,” and from this statement we ourselves deduce that his offspring from one of the disqualified women is profaned, [rendered unfit for the priesthood].

Verse 16



Verse 17

SPEAK UNTO AARON, SAYING: WHOSOEVER HE BE OF THY SEED THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS. He does not state here “speak unto Aaron and his sons” as He does in all [other] sections,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 6:2, etc.</i> because there in the Scriptural portions He commanded the laws of the offerings: <i>This is the law of the burnt-offering;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 6:2, etc.</i> <i>This is the law of the sin-offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:18.</i> and <i>of the guilt-offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 7:1.</i> and so on [and these laws apply to all priests — Aaron and his sons alike]. But here, if He were to have said “Speak unto Aaron and his sons,” He would have had to continue by saying: “Whosoever <i>of you</i> be throughout your generations” [which would have included Aaron among priests that might have a blemish, which this section discusses], and He did not want to warn Aaron himself about the law of blemishes, because <i>Aaron the holy one of the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 106:16.</i> is <i>all fair</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 4:7. <i>And there is no blemish in thee</i>.</i> and there shall be no blemish in him. Instead He admonished him concerning his seed, that he is to teach them these laws and warn them throughout their generations. In the section on impurity immediately following, however, He does say: <i>Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 22:2.</i> because it is possible that even Aaron might happen to become impure by touching a corpse or a dead swarming thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 11:29-31.</i> But when He comes to mention the impurity of leprosy or a flux, He again says, <i>What man soever of the seed of Aaron</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 22:4.</i> because this would not happen to the body [of Aaron], <i>for he is the messenger of the Eternal of hosts</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 2:7.</i> At the end of this section He states, <i>So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 24.</i> [although Moses had been told, <i>Speak unto Aaron, saying</i>, etc.], because Moses wanted to warn Aaron’s sons as well in order that they should receive the instruction directly from his mouth. He also said so <i>to the children of Israel</i>, which means that he warned the court of Israel on this matter.<br>Now in the Torath Kohanim I have found this text:<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 3:5.</i> “<i>Whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> Why is this said [since it has already been mentioned in the preceding verse]? But because it says <i>the seed of Aaron</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 17 before us: <i>Speak unto Aaron … Whosoever he be of thy seed</i>. Also in Verse 21: <i>of the seed of Aaron</i>.</i> I would only know that this law [of blemishes] applies to Aaron’s offspring. How do I know that it applies to Aaron himself? From the verse which states, <i>For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> Similarly it has been taught there:<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 4:1.</i> “<i>The seed of Aaron</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 17 before us: <i>Speak unto Aaron … Whosoever he be of thy seed</i>. Also in Verse 21: <i>of the seed of Aaron</i>.</i> I would only know that this law [of blemishes] applies to Aaron’s offspring. How do I know that it applies to Aaron himself? From the verse which states, <i>For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish. ”</i><sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> Similarly it has been taught there:<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 4:1.</i> “<i>The seed of Aaron</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 17 before us: <i>Speak unto Aaron … Whosoever he be of thy seed</i>. Also in Verse 21: <i>of the seed of Aaron</i>.</i> I would only know that this law applies to Aaron’s seed. How do I know that it applies to Aaron himself? From the verse <i>and he is a leper, or hath an issue</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 22:4.</i> Now [that which the Torath Kohanim states] “Aaron himself,” means [any] High Priest <i>that shall be in his stead among his sons</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 6:15.</i> [but it does not mean Aaron personally, since, as explained above, Scripture does not mention Aaron’s name with reference to having a blemish or suffering from leprosy or an issue. It did, however, have to include the High Priest in the law of blemishes], because having permitted the High Priest [to officiate] whilst he is an <i>onen</i>, one might perhaps think that it also permits him [to officiate] although he has a blemish or leprosy. For this reason it became necessary to include him in this law. Or it may be that [the Torath Kohanim] <i>is</i> alluding to the law about Aaron himself, for the Torah in its prohibitions does not rely on a miracle. However, it concealed it [the prohibition] in connection with Aaron, in his honor, thus hinting that this would [in fact] not happen to him.

Verse 18

O (OR) CHARUM O (OR) SARU’A.’ “[<i>Charum</i>] is anyone whose nose is sunk between his two eyes, so that he is able to paint both his eyes [for cosmetic purposes] with one stroke.” This is Rashi’s language. And in the Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 3:7.</i> and in the Gemara of Tractate Bechoroth<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Bechoroth 43 b.</i> we have been taught: “<i>Charum</i> is one whose nose is sunk. [How do I know about] one whose nose is obstructed? or one whose nose is turned up? or whose nose overhangs his lips? From the expression <i>o charum</i>, [the word <i>‘o’</i> (or) includes these blemishes]. Aba Yosei says: The word <i>charum</i> means only one who can paint both his eyes with one stroke. But the Rabbis said to him: ‘You have overstated it. Even though he cannot paint both his eyes with one stroke’” [because his nose is not so deeply sunken, he may nonetheless come within the term <i>charum</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s objection to Rashi’s interpretation is thus clear. Rashi stated that <i>charum</i> is one whose nose is so far sunk that he is able to paint both his eyes with one stroke. But, as pointed out by Ramban, this is only the opinion of a single Sage, Aba Yosei, while all the other Sages differ with him, as explained in the text. Mizrachi too, writes that he does not know what prompted Rashi to follow the opinion of a single Sage. See also Gur Aryeh.</i><br>The term <i>charum</i> is of the expressions: <i>None ‘cheirem’</i> (<i>doomed</i>) <i>who shall be ‘yachoram’</i> (<i>doomed of man</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 27:29.</i> <i>‘v’hacharamti’</i>(<i>and I shall utterly destroy</i>) <i>their cities</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 21:2.</i> the meaning thereof being destruction. Now [a man with a sunken nose] is called <i>charum</i> because the nose determines the beauty of the face, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 120 a.</i> “Evidence [as to the identity of a corpse] may not be given unless [from proof afforded by recognition] of the face together with the nose,” and if someone’s nose is unlike that of the appearance of normal people, the shape [of his face] is deemed “destroyed.”<br><i>‘O gibein o dak o t’valul b’eino.’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 20.</i> The expression ‘<i>o gibein’</i> is connected with the word <i>‘b’eino’</i> (<i>in his eye</i>), meaning that he is either a <i>gibein</i> in his eye, or has a <i>dak</i> (membrane) or a <i>t’valul</i> (a speck) in his eye, <i>gibein</i> meaning that the hair of his eyebrows are so long that they lie over his eyes, of the expressions: <i>‘gav’</i> (<i>the side of</i>) <i>the altar;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 43:13.</i> <i>upon ‘gabi’</i> (<i>my back</i>) <i>plowed the plowers</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 129:3.</i><br>Now Scripture mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban now sets forth the thought that the blemishes mentioned in these verses are primary types of blemishes, which are to serve as examples for other defects to be deduced therefrom. Thus the Torah mentioned first, cases of missing limbs, then uneven limbs etc. Thus the list here, although not exhaustive, served as the source for the deduction of other defects enumerated by the Rabbis of the Talmud.</i> first [in Verse 18 before us] blemishes of missing limbs: <i>a blind man, or a lame</i>, and afterwards [it<br>mentioned blemishes which are a result of] the smallness of the limbs, such as the <i>charum</i> [whose nose is sunk into his face, and consequently is shorter than the normal nose], or a result of the largeness of the limbs, such as the <i>saru’a</i> [meaning “anything too long,” as where one eye is larger than the other, or one leg longer]. Then in the following verse [19] it cites blemishes because of the breaking of bones even though he has all his limbs with him, nonetheless, if the bone is broken, he is disqualified [from ministering the Service]. Then [in Verse 20] He disqualified [a priest from performing the Service] even on account of a hideous appearance, such as one whose eyebrows overhang his eyes, or who has kernel-like growths in his eyes [like a membrane or a speck], and then it mentioned blemishes on the flesh of the body [such as scabs or scurvy], because he [the priest] must be clean and smooth [in flesh]. And afterwards He added [<i>o m’roach ashech</i>, which means] one who has wind [and as a result of which] his testicles are swollen, even though it is a sickness common amongst older people, and is not a blemish in the bone or flesh. Now our Rabbis have explained<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Bechoroth, Chapter 6.</i> many other blemishes which are deduced from these, for those mentioned in the Torah are merely the primary [categories of those] blemishes [deduced by the Rabbis].

SPEAK UNTO AARON AND TO HIS SONS, THAT THEY SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE HOLY THINGS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND THAT THEY PROFANE NOT MY HOLY NAME, WHICH THEY HALLOW UNTO ME. “Transpose the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">There are three phrases here in the order they are written in the verse: 1. <i>that they separate themselves, from the holy things of the children of Israel</i>. 2. <i>and that they profane not My holy Name</i>. 3. <i>which they hallow unto Me</i>. Now since the sense of the verse is that when the priests are in a state of impurity, they are to separate themselves from the holy things which <i>the Israelites have hallowed</i> to G-d’s Name, such as the offerings and the heave-offering, etc., then phrase 3 should follow phrase 1, since the word “they” (in phrase 3) refers back to “the children of Israel” at the end of phrase 1. In other words, since the word “they” in phrase 3 means “the children of Israel” mentioned in phrase 1, and the word “they” in phrase 2 definitely means “the priests,” why did Scripture place phrase 2 between phrases 1 and 3, which both refer to the children of Israel? Therefore Rashi, by way of interpretation, transposed the phrases to be read in this order: 1, 3, 2. This transposed order is followed in the J.P.S. translation.</i> and interpret it thus: ‘that they [the priests when in a state of impurity] separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they [the children of Israel] hallow unto Me, and that they [the priests] profane not My holy Name.’ <i>Which they hallow unto Me</i>, this comes to include things hallowed by the priests themselves.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But if we explain <i>which they hallow unto Me</i> as referring to [the things] which the priests themselves hallow, then there is no need for this transposition!<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s point is as follows: As long as we interpreted the verse as referring only to the holy things which <i>the children of Israel</i> have hallowed, it was necessary to transpose the phrases, as explained above. But if, as Rashi now suggests, the verse speaks of <i>two</i> kinds of hallowed things — those hallowed by Israelites and those made holy by the priests — then the word “they” in phrase 3 (see Note 81) no longer refers back to “the children of Israel” in phrase 1, and there is no need to transpose the order of the phrases! Hence the last sentence in Rashi contradicts his previous explanation!</i> Rather, [according to this final interpretation mentioned by Rashi, the whole verse can be explained in the order it is written without transposing the phrases, in the following way:] Scripture is stating: “<i>that they</i> [the priests] <i>separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they</i> [the priests] <i>profane not</i> by means of them [i.e., the holy things] <i>My holy Name</i> [through eating them in a state of impurity], and that <i>which they</i> [the priests themselves] <i>hallow unto Me</i>” [they should also not profane], meaning that they [the priests] should not profane the holy things which Aaron and his sons themselves hallow unto Me [and thus there is no need for transposing the verse.]! And in the Torath Kohanim it is interpreted as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 4:1.</i> “<i>That they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</i>. For <i>the holy things of the children of Israel</i> [the priests] are liable to punishment for [eating] <i>pigul</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Pigul</i> means an offering which has been rendered unfit through certain improper intentions at the time it was slaughtered or offered, namely if the ministering person had in mind to eat it, or to burn upon the altar the parts that must be burnt, after the expiration of the prescribed time” (“The Commandments,” Vol. II, p. 121). See there for the whole commandment about the prohibition of eating <i>pigul</i>.</i> <i>nothar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nothar</i> is meat of offerings which is left over beyond the time assigned for its consumption. See <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 119-120, about this prohibition of eating <i>nothar</i>.</i> or when in a state of impurity, but they are not liable for [eating] <i>pigul, nothar</i>, or when in a state of impurity if they are holy things of non-Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">A non-Jew could bring a burnt-offering (Chullin 13 b). See also “The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 74.</i> <i>The holy things of the children of Israel</i>. From this I would only know that [the priests when in a state of impurity are not to eat of] the holy things of the children of Israel. How do I know [that this prohibition applies also to] the holy things which they themselves have hallowed? From the expression, <i>which they hallow unto Me</i>, which includes all of them” [even those of the priests themselves]. But there [in the Torath Kohanim] no mention is made at all of a transposition of the verse [as Rashi said]! And by the way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <i>which they hallow unto Me, I am the Eternal</i> means that the priests are not to profane the Name which is hallowed to Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">“Him.” In Abusaula’s commentary on Ramban, the word is: “Me.” This follows the language of the verse: <i>which they hallow unto ‘Me.’</i></i> since His Name is upon the Sanctuary of the Eternal [and therefore they should not cause My Presence to depart therefrom when they profane the holy things].<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Abusaula.</i> I have already alluded to this in the section of <i>‘V’yikchu Li Terumah’</i> (<i>And they take for Me an offering</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 25:2.

N’VEILAH’ (THAT WHICH DIETH OF ITSELF) ‘U’TREIFAH’ (OR IS TORN OF BEASTS) HE SHALL NOT EAT TO DEFILE HIMSELF THEREWITH. Scripture is stating that [the priest] should be careful not to eat <i>n’veilah</i> or <i>treifah</i> so that he should not become defiled therewith, and then it will be necessary for him to be separated from the holy things,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">With this interpretation Ramban avoids the difficulty as to why the Torah singled out here the priests in mentioning the prohibition of <i>n’veilah</i> and <i>treifah</i>, since the law applies to all Israelites (See Exodus 22:30 on <i>treifah</i>, and Deuteronomy 14:21 on <i>n’veilah</i>). Ramban’s explanation is that since the main theme of this section is to warn the priests to separate themselves from holy things when they are in a state of impurity, therefore the Torah mentions here the admonition against their eating <i>n’veilah</i> and <i>treifah</i>, since by so doing they will not only have transgressed a law which applies to all Israel, but they will also have to separate themselves from the Sanctuary and its holy things, as they will have been rendered impure.</i> and he will not be able to eat of them until he bathes his flesh in water, <i>and when the sun is down, he shall be clean</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> And the reason [why He mentioned here the prohibition against eating <i>n’veilah</i> and <i>treifah</i>], is that since He had referred to every sort of impurity which can occur to a person, seeing that He mentioned leprosy and an issue,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> which includes male and female, and the impurity of the dead,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">This is not expressly mentioned in this section here. But the Rabbis interpreted: “<i>Or a man</i> (Verse 5), this refers to the dead.” (Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 4:4).</i> of semen,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> and of a swarming thing,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> therefore He goes back [in the verse before us] to warn [the priests to separate themselves] from the holy things when they are impure because of <i>n’veiloth</i>, and He warned them about this by way of an admonition against eating them. And the reason [why He singled out <i>n’veilah</i> and <i>treifah</i> in warning the priests not to eat them, and He did not mention those creeping things which also render the eater impure], is because a man’s soul finds it loathsome to eat creeping things, but it does not find <i>n’veilah</i> and <i>treifah</i> loathsome. Therefore He mentioned here [the prohibition against eating food which conveys] impurity in the case of [that food] which it is common [to eat]. Now the word <i>treifah</i> mentioned here [which renders the eater impure, must perforce] mean an animal that was torn by a lion or bear which killed it in the field, for when it is still alive [and is then slaughtered ritually] it does not convey impurity [although it may not be eaten. The term <i>treifah</i> which the Torah mentions here as conveying impurity to one who eats it, is applicable, however, even to an animal that was not killed when torn by beasts], for from the moment when it is torn by the lion [or any beast] it is called <i>treifah</i> (“torn”), whether it is alive or after its death.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore even after the animal torn by beasts has died, when strictly speaking it may be referred to as <i>n’veilah</i> since it was not ritually slaughtered, the Torah still calls it here <i>treifah</i>, for from the moment when it is torn by the beast it is called <i>treifah</i>, whether it is alive or after its death.</i> Thus He mentioned here all sources of impurity, for having stated that animals of the forbidden species [which are not mentioned here, although they do convey impurity to one who eats them], cannot be [made permissible by] ritual slaughtering,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">An animal that may <i>not</i> be eaten, even if ritually slaughtered, conveys impurity to the one who eats of it [in addition of course to having violated the prohibition against eating it], because there is no law of ritual slaughter regarding it, and it is therefore included under the term <i>n’veilah</i>. An animal of the permitted species, which, when ritually slaughtered, is found to have an organic disease which renders it forbidden for eating, does not convey impurity to the person who eats it, although he has transgressed the law which prohibits the eating of <i>treifah</i>.</i> as I have explained in the section of <i>‘Vay’hi Bayom Ha’shemini’</i> (<i>And it came to pass on the eighth day</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 9:1. — <i>Ibid.</i>, 11:24.</i> it is [automatically] included under the term of <i>n’veilah</i> [which is mentioned here]. This is by way of the plain meaning of Scripture. The [Rabbinical] explanation<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Chullin 100 b, and mentioned here in Rashi.</i> likewise interprets [this verse as an admonition] about holy things with reference to impurity, namely that the verse speaks of the carrion of a bird of a permissible species<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">But a bird of a forbidden species has no defiling effect if eaten unintentionally (Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Aboth Hatumoth</i> 3:14). If there is, however, an intention to eat it, and it has been rendered susceptible to impurity [by having come into contact with liquid], it is like any other food and may itself contract a first grade impurity, but only if it itself comes into contact with an object that conveys impurity. It is not, however, capable of rendering the eater impure, as <i>human beings</i> cannot become impure through contact with <i>food</i>. The case of the carrion of a bird of a permitted species is a special exception, because in that case the Torah declared that it conveys impurity automatically <i>if eaten</i> [but not if merely touched], although it itself has not received impurity from another object. In short, it is, if eaten, a primary source of impurity which renders the eater impure.</i> [i.e., which died by itself, or has not been slaughtered properly], which has no defiling effect by means of contact or carrying, but [conveys] impurity only when in the [eater’s] gullet, and thus it forbids him to eat [subsequently] of the holy things. And we must then explain [that when Scripture states here] <i>‘u’treifah’</i> (<i>or is torn of beasts</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, since as explained, the verse before us has reference only to the <i>carrion</i> of a permitted species of bird, which is <i>n’veilah</i>, why then did Scripture here mention <i>treifah</i> altogether? The answer is: it was necessary for Scripture to state here also <i>u’treifah</i> etc.</i> [it is in order to define the term <i>n’veilah</i>, and to explain that this law of impurity of <i>n’veilah</i> refers only] to those <i>kinds</i> [of birds] that can have a <i>treifah</i> [i.e., to those species which may usually be eaten if slaughtered properly, but which are nonetheless <i>treifah</i> if found to be suffering from certain organic diseases, and consequently forbidden to be eaten], thus excluding the carrion of a bird of one of the <i>forbidden</i> species, for in its class no <i>treifah</i> is ever possible [for such a bird, even if ritually slaughtered, is still <i>n’veilah</i>, since the law of <i>treifah</i> only applies to such birds which, if they were healthy, would be permitted as food by means of ritual slaughter, which does not apply to these forbidden species], as is stated in the language of Rashi [here]. And as far as the impurity of other <i>n’veiloth</i> is concerned, [so that the priest must be careful not to be defiled by them as this will make it necessary for him to be separated from the holy things, although they are not expressly mentioned in Scripture], they have been included in the Torath Kohanim on the basis of the following interpretation:<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 4:4.</i> “<i>Or whosoever toucheth ‘b’chol’</i> (<i>any</i>) <i>swarming thing</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 5.</i> I would only know the swarming thing. How do I know to include <i>n’veilah</i>? From the expression <i>b’chol</i> (any).”

AND IF A MAN EAT OF THE HOLY THING<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Here referring to <i>terumah</i> (the heave-offering) which is given to the priest from the produce of the Land.</i> THROUGH ERROR, THEN HE SHALL ADD ITS FIFTH PART UNTO IT, AND SHALL GIVE UNTO THE PRIEST THE HOLY THING. “He must give him a thing which is capable of becoming holy [like the original holy food of the priest that he ate, thus teaching] that he is not to pay him money, but fruits of a non-holy status, which then become <i>terumah</i> (a heave-offering).” This is Rashi’s language. Thus the explanation of the verse is as follows: “A man that eats the holy thing [i.e., the heave-offering which belongs to the priest], must add the fifth of that holy thing to it, <i>and give to the priest</i> this <i>holy thing</i> which is its original value and the added fifth.” And since Scripture called it [the restitution] <i>kodesh</i> (holy thing), we deduce that it becomes as the original heave-offering [which he ate in error, and that it must therefore be] something which is capable of so becoming [namely fruits, but not money]. This is the correct explanation according to both the plain meaning of Scripture and the [Rabbinical] interpretation thereof. So also did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra comment: “<i>And he shall give unto the priests ‘eth’ the holy thing</i>, means ‘with’ the holy thing [i.e., he is to give the priest its original value with the added fifth, all in fruits]. Or it may that the word <i>v’nathan</i> (and he shall give) draws along with it a similar word, and the sense of the verse is thus: ‘then he shall add its fifth part to it and shall give unto the priest, and he shall give unto the priest the holy thing.’ But in my opinion [so continues Ibn Ezra], there is no need [for both interpretations] because of the word <i>alav</i> (to it).”<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, since Scripture states, <i>then he shall add its fifth part ‘to it</i>,’ it implies already that it is in addition to the original value of the heave-offering he ate which he must return to the priest. There is therefore no need any longer to interpret <i>and he shall give unto the priest ‘eth’ the holy thing</i> as meaning “with” the holy thing, since this has already been mentioned above in the preceding verse, and instead we interpret the word <i>eth</i> in its normal way, namely, the mark of the accusative case. By the same token of reasoning, the second interpretation mentioned in the text [that the word <i>v’nathan</i> draws along with it a similar word] also becomes unnecessary, since the word <i>alav</i> (to it) clearly indicates that he is to give both the original value and the added fifth to the priest.</i>

Verse 15

AND THEY SHALL NOT PROFANE THE HOLY THINGS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL — “by giving them to non-priests to be eaten.” 16. AND SO CAUSE ‘OTHAM’ (THEM) TO BEAR THE INIQUITY THAT BRINGETH GUILT. “[The word <i>otham</i> here means] ‘themselves,’ meaning that they [the priests) cause themselves to bear iniquity when they [the non-priests] eat the holy things which have been set aside as the heave-offering, and have become sanctified as such, and forbidden to them [the non-priests]. And Onkelos who rendered the verse: ‘when they [the priests] eat them in impurity’ has translated it so unnecessarily.”<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">For since the preceding verse [14] speaks of a non-priest eating the heave-offering, it is logical to interpret Verse 16 before us as being an admonition to the priests against giving the heave-offering to be eaten by non-priests [as Rashi first interpreted the verse]. According to Onkelos’ interpretation, however, that it is an admonition to the priests that they themselves should not eat it when in a state of impurity, then it properly belongs in the section above. For this reason Rashi rejected Onkelos’ interpretation as “unnecessary,” meaning to say, that while it is of course true that the priests are not permitted to do so, it is unnecessary to derive this prohibition from our verse, as it may be derived by logical deduction from Verse 6 above, which states concerning a priest who has become defiled, <i>he shall not eat of the holy things</i> (Verse 4; Makkoth 14 b).</i> Thus far is the language of Rashi, of blessed memory.<br>But I did not understand Rashi’s opinion. For it would appear from his words that this negative commandment constitutes a prohibition to the priests, that they are not to give the heave-offering to non-priests to eat of it. And if so, it would be fitting to explain [the word <i>‘otham’</i> in the phrase] <i>and so cause ‘otham’</i> (<i>them</i>), as a pronoun for “Israel,” meaning that the priests will thereby burden the Israelites with <i>the iniquity that beareth guilt</i>, when they [the Israelites] eat the holy things! Why then did Rabbi Yishmael find it necessary to interpret the word <i>otham</i> [as a reflexive form], meaning “themselves” [as Rashi mentioned]? Besides, this negative commandment is not mentioned [specifically] in the Talmud, but instead the priest is forbidden to do so as is the case with all other prohibitions [where we are forbidden to help or cause another person to commit a transgression].<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 277-278.</i> Rather, the explanation of the phrase <i>the children of Israel</i> [in Verse 15] is that it refers back to the beginning [part of that verse, thus making it as follows]: “<i>and</i> the children of Israel <i>shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which they set apart unto the Eternal</i>,” the verse thus constituting a second admonition<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">The first admonition is in Verse 10 here: <i>There shall no common man eat of the holy thing</i>.</i> to the non-priest that he is not to eat of the holy things, [and the reason why it is repeated is] because He wanted to mention the punishment for the transgression thereof, stating <i>and they will cause themselves to bear the iniquity</i> etc. <i>when they</i> [the non-priests] <i>will eat their holy things</i>.<br>Now our Rabbis explained [that the reason for] the repetition of this admonition was to forbid the eating of <i>tevel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> Thus they have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 83 a.</i> “Whence do we know that one who eats <i>tevel</i> is liable to death [by the hand of Heaven]? From the verse, <i>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which ‘yarimu’</i> (<i>they shall set apart</i>) <i>unto the Eternal</i>. Now the verse refers to that which is <i>yet</i> to be offered [namely, the verse refers to the holy things — the heave-offering and the tithes — which are not yet set apart from the produce, so that it is all <i>tevel</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> and then an identity of law is learned from the use of ‘profanation’ here and in the case of the heave-offering:<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Reference is to Numbers 18:32: <i>Ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not</i>. See “The Commandments,” Vol. II pp. 143-145, where this whole subject is discussed at length.</i> [just as there the penalty is death by the hand of Heaven, so here too].”<br>However, in the Torath Kohanim I have found this text:<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 6:8-10.</i> “<i>And they shall not profane</i>. This includes one who anoints himself with or drinks [oil of heave-offering].<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">In Tractate Niddah 32a this is explained as follows: “This includes a case where a non-priest anoints himself with the oil of heave-offering, so that he is as liable as if he had drunk it; but for drinking itself we need no verse to include it in the prohibition, since drinking is always included under the term of ‘eating.’”</i> <i>The holy things of the children of Israel</i>. For the things [declared] holy by the children of Israel, [a non-priest who eats of them by mistake] is liable to pay the priest their value and the added fifth [in fruits], but for the things [declared] holy by non-Jews, he [a non-priest] is not liable to repay [the priest] their value and the added fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">In our Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 6:8-10, the reading is as follows: “For the holy things of the children of Israel, [a non-priest who eats of them by mistake] is liable to add a fifth [to the original value], but for the holy things of non-Jews, he is not obliged to pay the added fifth.” The original value he must of course repay, since they were not his.</i> I might think that he is liable [to pay a fifth] for the heave-offering that is in the <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> [as will be explained further on]; Scripture therefore states, <i>that which ‘yarimu’</i> (<i>they will set apart</i>) <i>unto the Eternal</i>. For that which has been set apart they are liable to pay [an added fifth], but they are not liable to pay [an added fifth] for the heave-offering in the <i>tevel</i> [which has not yet been set apart]. <i>And so they will cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt</i>. This teaches us that for eating <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> one is also punishable by death [by the hand of Heaven].” Now this [Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim] is not in accord with the way of the Gemara [mentioned above].<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">The discrepancies between the Gemara and the Torath Kohanim are as follows: (a) The Gemara interprets the verse, <i>And they shall not profane</i> etc. as referring to that which is yet to be offered [as explained above in the text], and the Torath Kohanim explained it to include anointing oneself with or drinking oil of heave-offering. (b) In the Gemara the Rabbis derived from the Scriptural use of the word <i>yarimu</i> (they shall set apart) in the future, that this establishes the prohibition against eating <i>tevel</i> [as explained in the text], while the Torath Kohanim interpreted it to teach that for the heave-offering in the <i>tevel</i> he does not pay a fifth, if he ate it in error.</i> But I say that the inclusion of anointing and drinking [in the prohibition of our verse] is only a Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance, since drinking is included in the term eating [and just as a non-priest is Scripturally forbidden to eat the heave-offering, so too he is Scripturally forbidden to drink it, without the necessity for a special inclusionary phrase], whilst anointing oneself with it is [only] prohibited by Rabbinic ordinance. It is so clearly explained in the Yerushalmi.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi, Maaser Sheini II, 1.</i> And since He stated with reference to <i>tevel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tevel</i> is produce from which the heave-offering and the tithes have not been separated.</i> <i>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel</i>, because they are going to set aside a part thereof for the Eternal [as the future tense in the word <i>yarimu</i> — “they <i>will</i> set apart” — indicates], the Rabbis deduced from this that [only] the portion which is set apart [as the heave-offering] is called “holy”, and not the <i>tevel</i>. And if so, [eating <i>tevel</i>] is <i>not</i> included in the terms of the law, <i>And if a man eat of ‘the holy’ thing through error, then he shall add its fifth to it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> so that he be liable to pay the additional fifth.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">One might have thought that since <i>tevel</i> contains the heave-offering which will be set apart for the priest, a non-priest who eats it by mistake should therefore make restitution to the priest by giving him its value and an added fifth, just as if he had eaten separately heave-offering which has already been removed from the produce. To preclude us from such reasoning, Scripture states here that he does not have to pay the additional fifth. However, the Divine punishment for eating <i>tevel</i> is the same as for eating the heave-offering, as Ramban continues.</i> It is for this reason that He teaches again, <i>and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt</i>, thereby teaching that eating <i>tevel</i> is also punishable by death [by the hand of Heaven], for it is the heave-offering in the <i>tevel</i> that is mentioned here. In brief, this verse speak of <i>tevel</i> and warns with reference to that which is yet to be offered in the future, according to the interpretation of our Rabbis.

Now the reason for this difference between them [a vow and a freewill-offering],<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the text now quoted apparently does not hold the opinion that a vow-offering is made only in time of distress, and a freewill-offering when one is in good circumstances. Rather, the difference between them is etc.</i> is because the custom of those vowing in the time of their distress is to say, “<i>If G-d will be with me</i><sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 28:20.</i> [and guard me] in this [trouble], then I pledge myself to offer a burnt-offering or a [peace-] offering,” and this is not usually called a freewill-offering, [since he has not yet set aside any particular animal for it]. But [a vow which is followed] by setting aside immediately [an animal] and giving it, is called “a freewill-offering,” because from the moment of giving, <i>his spirit made</i> him <i>willing</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 35:21.</i> Thus Scripture is stating here that whether he brings a burnt-offering or a peace-offering which he vowed at the time of his distress, or whether he brings them because his spirit made him willing — in either case it must be perfect [without blemish], for perhaps we might have thought that [it is more important that] the vow-offering should be perfect than the freewill-offering. This is the meaning of the verse.

Verse 23

ANY OF THE HERD OR FLOCK THAT HATH A LIMB TOO LARGE OR TOO SMALL, THAT MAYEST THOU MAKE FOR ‘NEDAVAH’ (A FREEWILL-OFFERING) — “for keeping the Temple in repair.”<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi thus understood the word <i>nedavah</i> here not as a freewill-offering for the altar [as we have understood the word till now], but as a freewill <i>gift</i> for the Temple repair. Ramban will further on afford a satisfactory explanation for this interpretation.</i> ‘UL’NEDER’ (BUT FOR A VOW-OFFERING) IT SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTED — “for the altar. What hallowed thing is it that effects propitiation? I must say that it is something dedicated to the altar.” This is Rashi’s language. But according to this explanation, we must interpret the verse, <i>that mayest thou make for ‘nedavah’</i> (<i>a freewill-offering</i>), <i>‘ul’neder’</i> (<i>but for a vow-offering</i>) <i>it shall not be accepted</i> as stating: that [a blemished animal] may be given as a freewill gift or as a vow [to be sold so that its money is used] for the Temple repair, but not for acceptance [to be offered up itself] on the altar; for there is no difference between a <i>neder</i> (vow-offering) and <i>nedevah</i> (freewill-offering) in this respect at all, both being permissible for the Temple repair<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they can be sold for common food and the money used for the repair of the Temple.</i> and prohibited for the altar [on account of the blemish in them], and Scripture has already mentioned this in the case of the burnt-offering, <i>whether it be any of their vow-offerings, or any of their freewill-offerings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Above Verse 18.</i> and in the case of the peace-offering, <i>in fulfillment of a vow-offering clearly uttered, or for a freewill-offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> And such is the interpretation of our Rabbis in the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 7:6.</i><br>It is possible that we can improve the explanation as to the language of Scripture [i.e., why it uses here the term <i>nedavah</i> for a freewill gift for Temple repair]. For since most freewill gifts are given for Temple repair, as it is said with reference to the Tabernacle, <i>all that were ‘n’div leiv’</i> (<i>willing-hearted</i>) …<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 35:22.</i> <i>brought the Eternal’s offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> and similarly with reference to the Sanctuary it is said, <i>As for me, in the uprightness of my heart ‘hithnadavti’</i> (<i>I have willingly offered</i>) <i>all these things</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">I Chronicles 29:17.</i> and so also in connection with the Second Temple it is said, <i>beside ‘ha’nedavah’</i> (<i>the freewill-offering</i>) <i>for the House of G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Ezra 1:4.</i> and it is likewise written about the Temple repair, <i>all the money that cometh into any man’s heart to bring into the House of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 12:5.</i> therefore it is [called] the freewill gift [without qualification, and Scripture here uses the term <i>nedavah</i> as referring not to a type of offering, but to the freewill gift for Temple repair]. And the reason for [this expression] is that there is nothing in connection with gifts for Temple repair which is obligatory, for [they are all brought only as a consequence of] willingness of the soul, and the custom of those who give a donation for Temple repair is that they bring it with [the language used in offering a] freewill-offering, “‘This is’ for the building.” Therefore wherever Scripture mentions <i>nedavah</i> without any qualification, it is for Temple repair, unless [the donor] expressly says that it is <i>for a burnt-offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Above Verse 18.</i> or <i>an offering of peace-offerings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> as mentioned above. But the term <i>neder</i> (vow) without any qualification is said with reference to the holy things of the altar: <i>I will offer to Thee the offering of thanksgiving … I will pay ‘nedarai’</i> (<i>my vows</i>) <i>unto the Eternal, yea in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Eternal’s House;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 116:17-19.</i> <i>I will come into Thy House with burnt-offerings, I will perform unto Thee ‘nedarai’</i> (<i>my vows</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 66:13.</i> <i>‘Nedarecha’</i> (<i>Thy vows</i>) <i>are upon me, O G-d; I will render thanks-offerings unto Thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 56:13.</i> And those who give for the altar bring [their animals] with [the language used in offering a vow-offering], saying, “If G-d will prosper me, I will come before Him with a burnt-offering.” It is for this reason that Scripture says here, <i>Any of the herd or flock that hath a limb too large or too small, that mayest thou make ‘nedavah’</i> (<i>a freewill gift</i>) [for Temple repair], for whatever his heart offers freewillingly, <i>but for a ‘neder’</i> (<i>a vow</i>) for G-d [i.e., for His altar] <i>it shall not be accepted</i>, just as He said, <i>that ye shall not bring, for it shall not be acceptable for you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 20.</i> For Scripture did not say here, “<i>nedavah ‘takriv’ otho</i> (thou mayest ‘offer’ it as a freewill-offering),” which would have been similar to the expression [of <i>thakrivu</i> — “they shall offer” on the altar] used in this whole section,<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">See Verses 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, where the expressions <i>yakriv, yakrivu, thakrivu</i>, are used. Now these words signify the bringing of an offering. But not so <i>ta’aseh</i> (thou shalt “make”), as Ramban continues to explain. Hence since it states here: “a freewill-offering <i>ta’aseh otho</i>,” the reference is not to making it an offering, but that we may make a gift of a blemished animal to the Temple treasury for necessary repairs. Rashi’s interpretation [“<i>that mayest thou make for a freewill-offering</i> — for keeping the Temple in repair”], is thus well-founded in the language of the verse.</i> but instead it says <i>‘ta’aseh otho’</i> (<i>thou mayest ‘make’ it</i>) — meaning to say, you may make of it <i>whatever thy hand attaineth to do by thy strength</i><sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 9:10.</i> — <i>but for a vow-offering it shall not be accepted</i>. Now [the reason] the Sages were forced to say this [interpretation, i.e., that <i>nedavah ta’aseh otho</i> here means that you may give the blemished animal as a gift to the Temple treasury, but may not bring it as an offering] is because it is in no way whatsoever possible to say that [an animal suffering from] any blemishes [mentioned in the <i>preceding</i> verses], namely, scabbed and scurvy,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> or even one whose testicles are bruised or crushed,<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> be forbidden for any kind of offering, whether as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering, and then an animal which has any limb too long or too short [as mentioned in the verse before us] be forbidden for use only for some offerings, [i.e., vow-offerings] and permissible for others [i.e., freewill-offerings]! Such a distinction [between the kinds of offering] is not found in the Torah with reference to blemishes or impurity in those who perform the rites of the offerings [i.e., the priests]!<br>It is possible that He said that <i>any of the herd or flock that hath a limb too large or too small</i>, one may make into a freewill-offering [for the Temple repairs] by saying, “This shall be [<i>nedavah</i> — a gift];” but if he had vowed [for the Temple repairs by saying] “I pledge myself [to donate] of the herd or flock,” then if he brings a blemished animal it will not be acceptable for him, and he is not freed of his vow. We may thus say in accordance with the way [of interpretation] of our Rabbis that both [<i>nedavah</i> and <i>neder</i> mentioned in the verse before us] refer to gifts for the Temple repairs, since the expression <i>‘ta’aseh otho’</i> (<i>thou mayest ‘make’ it</i>) is unlike <i>takriv otho</i> [“thou mayest ‘offer’ it” on the altar]. This is without doubt the truth.<br>Now Scripture mentioned the permissibility of making a gift for the Temple repairs in the case of an animal that has a limb too long or too short, which are congenital blemishes in the formation of the animal, and it follows all the more so that an animal having small blemishes by [later] occurrence, such as <i>avereth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> which is blindness [caused] by the dimming of the eye, or a broken animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> and needless to say [an animal that is] scabbed or [suffering from] scurvy,<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> [may be given as gifts for the Temple repairs]. It is possible that the verse [before us] is connected [with the preceding verse, thus]: “<i>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wart, or scabbed, or scurvy</i> … and all <i>herd or flock that hath any thing too long or too short, thou mayest make a freewill gift</i> of any of these, <i>but for a vow-offering</i> [for the altar] <i>none</i> of these <i>will be acceptable</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> for him, meaning that even if they had been taken up to the altar, they must be brought down.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 6:2.</i> And in the Torath Kohanim [it is written]:<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 7:5.</i> “Whence do we know to include all disqualifications in the herd or flock?<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Such as an animal that is too young for an offering (so explained by Malbim <i>ibid.</i>).</i> From the verse, <i>any of the herd or flock</i><sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Why is this expression [<i>any of the herd or flock</i>] mentioned here at all, when it would have sufficed to state “and one that has a limb too large etc.”? The Torath Kohanim answers that it forms a sort of “similar expression” with Verse 28 further on, stating: <i>And whether it be one of the herd or flock, ye shall not slaughter it and its young both in one day</i>, this being a case of “lacking time,” and the verse before us thus establishes the principle that <i>anything</i> disqualified for offering in the herd or flock, must not be brought as an offering.</i> <i>that hath a limb too large or too small</i>, which includes all disqualifications of the herd or flock.” Our Rabbis have further included [a principle] within the expression <i>that mayest thou make for a freewill gift</i>, meaning that he may make [a blemished animal] as a gift for whatever [purpose in the Temple that] he pleases, but not unblemished animals, so that one who dedicates unblemished animals [which are fit for the altar] for Temple repairs, transgresses a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">“For since it states, <i>that mayest thou make for a freewill gift</i> [for Temple repairs], it teaches that only a blemished animal we may so dedicate, but not an unblemished animal, and a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment carries the force of the positive commandment” (Temurah 7b).</i>

AND WHETHER IT BE OF THE HERD OR FLOCK, ‘OTHO V’ETH B’NO’<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “him and his young” — in the masculine. Since the law, as will be explained, applies only to the mother and the young, the question appears why Scripture uses here the masculine. Ramban will further on explain it.</i> (IT AND ITS YOUNG) YE SHALL NOT SLAUGHTER IN ONE DAY. “[The law] applies only in the case of the female parent, it being forbidden to slaughter the dam and its male young, or the dam and its female young, but it does not apply to the male parent, and it is therefore permissible to slaughter the male parent and his young.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>The Rabbi [Rashi] thus decided that the conclusive decision of the law is in accordance with the opinion of the Sage<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehudah (Chullin 79 a).</i> who says that we do not take into consideration the male parentage [of animals]. And such also is the opinion of Onkelos [who translated: “and whether it be the dam or the ewe, her and her young ye shall not slaughter in one day”]. This is the correct decision [reached] in the Gemara [of Tractate Chullin]<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i></i> concerning the law of “It and its young.” But the way of Scripture when mentioning specifically the female [of the herd], is to call it <i>parah</i> (cow),<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 32:16, etc.</i> and if so it would have been proper that Scripture say, “and whether it be <i>parah</i> (cow) or ewe, her and her young.” But since He had mentioned [at the beginning of this section], <i>When any of the herd, or a sheep or a goat is brought forth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 27.</i> and He mentioned the dam and its young by saying, <i>then it shall be seven days under its dam</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 27.</i> He therefore states [in the verse before us] that concerning these kinds of animals mentioned, namely, the herd and the flock, there is yet another commandment that <i>it and its young</i> mentioned above, must not be slaughtered <i>in one day</i> [and thus it is self-evident that the law applies only to the female parent].

Verse 29

Verse 31

AND YE SHALL KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS. The meaning of this is that here He admonished Israel to keep the commandments, that they should be careful with the offerings [that they should not have] blemishes, or be wanting in time, such as before completion of the seven days [after birth of the animal], and [that they may not be slaughtered] on the day that the dam had been slaughtered [or conversely], and that they bring the peace-offerings and the thanks-offering [properly as ordained], and that they slaughter them with the intention that they be accepted for them;<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 29.</i> thus He included therein all commandments together. Now He has already mentioned above with reference to the statutes and ordinances, <i>And ye shall observe all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 19:37.</i> He states [here], <i>And ye shall not profane My holy Name</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 32.</i> which means to say that there should not be among you <i>one who dealeth craftily</i>, [<i>whereas he hath in his flock a male, and voweth</i>,] <i>and sacrificeth unto the Eternal a blemished thing</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 1:14.</i> just as He said with reference to the sons of Aaron, <i>and they profane not My holy Name</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 2.</i> warning them in connection with the offerings against impurity or blemishes.

Verse 32

AND I WILL BE HALLOWED AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The meaning thereof according to the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 9:4: “When it states, <i>And I will be hallowed</i> it means: ‘be ready to die and hallow My Name.’”</i> is that it constitutes a positive commandment, that we sanctify His Name by observing the commandments, and that [under certain circumstances] we submit to death rather than transgress them.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 12-15, for a full discussion of this commandment.</i> This is the explanation of the following verse, <i>That brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 33.</i> which is a reason including all the commandments, meaning that it is fitting for them to sanctify His Name because we are His servants whom He has redeemed from Egypt.

Verse 2

SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The priests have no greater duties with regard to the festivals than the Israelites, therefore He did not admonish Aaron and his sons in this section, but <i>the children of Israel</i>, a term which includes all of them together, since He did not explain the Additional Offerings [for the festivals] in this section.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">These are found in Numbers beginning with 28:9 up to the end of Chapter 29.</i> However, He mentioned the festivals here in Torath Kohanim (i.e. Book of Leviticus) because they are days of offerings, and He alludes to them, just as He said, <i>And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 8, etc.</i> and at the end of this section He states, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a peace-offering, and drink-offerings</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 37.</i> He did not, however, prolong the subject by explaining the Additional Offerings, since He did not want them to be binding upon the children of Israel when in the desert, and after He had counted [at the end of the desert period] those who were to come into the Land, as narrated in the Book of Numbers,<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 1:1-47. Literally: “the fifth of the census,” meaning that one [of the Five Books of Moses] which begins with the census [taken in the second year after the exodus].</i> and He commanded, <i>Unto these the Land shall be divided</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 26:53.</i> He then explained all the Additional Offerings in the section of <i>Pinchas</i>, which they were to offer in the Land immediately and throughout the generations. Therefore He said [here in this Book of Leviticus] with reference to [the Service on] the Day of Atonement, <i>And he</i> [i.e., Aaron] <i>did as the Eternal commanded Moses</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 16:34.</i> meaning that he did so in the desert [but the Additional Offerings for the other festivals were not binding in the desert].<br>Now He mentioned in this section the “he-lamb of the sheaf”<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 12.</i> and the two lambs of the Festival of Shevuoth,<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> because it is well-known that they were binding only in the Land, since they are brought on account of <i>the bread</i> [<i>of the first-fruits</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20. So also the he-lamb of the sheaf came on account of the meal-offering of the <i>omer</i> (Verse 12) which was binding only in the Land of Israel.</i> concerning which He said, <i>When ye are come into the Land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 10.</i> but the observance of the days themselves [as festivals] was binding immediately.<br>He mentioned the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> among <i>the appointed seasons which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 2 before us.</i> [although the Sabbath is not proclaimed by the children of Israel, since its sanctity has been affirmed by G-d and is fixed throughout the generations], because it is also “an appointed day” [invariably fixed by G-d as the holy day] and we may thus refer to it as “a holy convocation.” Afterwards, He separated the rest of the festivals from the Sabbath, saying of them <i>which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> meaning on whatever day of the week they happen to fall, but the Sabbath is fixed and occurs [always] on the same day, hence it is not necessary that we proclaim it in its season.<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Hence in Verse 2 before us which includes the Sabbath among “the appointed seasons,” it says only <i>which shall ye proclaim to be holy convocations</i>, but does not add the expression “in their season,” for this means on whatever day they may happen to fall, whereas the Sabbath is always on a fixed day of the week.</i> And in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 9:5.</i> <i>which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season</i> alludes to the intercalations [of an extra month in a leap year] so that you proclaim them as festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">That is to say, if for any reason the Great Court decided that the year be intercalated with an extra month, it admits of no doubt, and <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i> are shifted accordingly.</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the meaning of the verse <i>The appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 2 before us.</i> is that it refers [only] to the festivals mentioned further on in the sections: <i>In the first month</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> [but it does not refer to the Sabbath]. It is for this reason that He states there once again, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> because He had interrupted with the subject of the Sabbath. Thus He states, <i>The appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 2 before us.</i> meaning that no manner of <i>servile</i> work [be done on them], but the Sabbath you are to keep, making it a <i>Sabbath of solemn rest</i><sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> from <i>all</i> manner of work<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban further in Verse 7 for the difference between “no manner of <i>‘m’lecheth avodah</i>’ (servile work)” found in connection with the festivals, and “no manner of <i>‘m’lachah’</i> (work)” stated in connection with the Sabbath.</i> whatsoever, for He admonishes concerning the Sabbath many times. He further alludes here [to the law that even] when the Sabbath falls on one of [the days of] the festivals, we must not suspend [the law of the Sabbath] so that the preparation of food be permitted on it [as it is on a festival day when it falls on a weekday, but instead it is prohibited]. A similar case [where the phrase <i>these are</i> refers to the continuation of a subject which had previously been mentioned, because in the middle Scripture interrupts with another subject], is the verse, <i>These are the words which the Eternal hath commanded, that ye should do them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 35:1.</i> which refers to the Tabernacle and its vessels which he [Moses] will mention in the second section, and [in the next verses] he interrupts with the Sabbath: <i>Six days shall work be done, and on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day</i> etc.;<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 2.</i> and then he again says, <i>This is the thing which the Eternal commanded … Take ye from among you an offering</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 4-5.</i> this being the [same] command that Scripture had mentioned at the beginning, but because it was interrupted with another subject, Scripture had to start from the beginning again.<br>Proof for this interpretation is that He does not mention [here] in the case of the Sabbath, <i>and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i> as He mentions at each and every festival,<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 8, etc.</i> and at the end of the section He states, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal … beside the Sabbaths of the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verses 37-38.</i> [This shows] that the Sabbaths are not included within the terms of <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>. A further proof is that in the second section [i.e., in Verse 4 where He reverts to the festivals after having mentioned the Sabbath], He does not say, <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying</i>, as He says in the case of each and every festival;<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9, etc.</i> for the first communication [to Moses] was indeed concerning the commandments of the festivals, but He mentioned the Sabbath in order to exclude from it the law of the festivals [i.e., that when the Sabbath coincides with a festival, the preparation of food which is permitted on a festival day, is forbidden since it is also a Sabbath, as explained above], but not in order to explain its commandments and laws [and therefore there was no need to repeat the verse, <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses, saying</i>]. This is the reason why He does not state [here] about the Sabbath <i>And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>, as He states concerning the festivals,<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">This is because His intention in mentioning the Sabbath was not to explain all its commandments and laws, but only to exclude etc. (as explained in the text).</i> and He mentions it at the end together with the vow-offerings and the freewill-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 38: <i>beside the Sabbaths of the Eternal … and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings</i>.</i> which are not mentioned here, as I have explained [above]. And this is the intention of the interpretation of the Sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 9:7.</i> who said: “What has the matter of the Sabbath to do with the festivals? etc.,” since the Sabbath is not included at all in the terms of <i>the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>, but Scripture only put them in juxtaposition [for the reason mentioned above].<br>The meaning of <i>‘mikra’ei kodesh’</i> (<i>holy convocations</i>), is that all people should come together on that day and be assembled to sanctify it, for it is a commandment upon Israel to be gathered together in G-d’s House on the festival day to hallow it publicly with prayer and praise to G-d, and with clean garments, and to make it a day of feasting, as it is said in the tradition,<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word is <i>kabalah</i>, and is here understood as referring to a Scriptural passage outside the Five Books of Moses. This usage of the word is found already in a Mishnah in Taanith 15 a.</i> <i>Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy unto our Lord; neither be ye grieved, for the joy of the Eternal is your strength</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 8:10.</i> Thus the expression <i>mikra kodesh</i> (<i>a holy convocation</i>) is similar to: <i>‘kru’ei’</i> (<i>those called</i>) <i>of the congregation;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 1:16.</i> <i>afterwards they eat ‘ha’kru’im’</i> (<i>they that are called</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 9:13.</i> Similarly, <i>over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over ‘mikra’eha’</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 4:5.</i> meaning the places where they are called to, and where those called of the congregation assemble. Onkelos, however, [in rendering the Hebrew <i>mikra’ei kodesh</i> as <i>m’arei kadish — ”</i>holy events”], understood [the word <i>mikra’ei</i>] as similar to the expression <i>that which ‘yikra’</i> (<i>shall befall</i>) <i>you in the end of days</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 49:1.</i> an expression of “event,” meaning that whenever the festivals occur, you should make them holy. And our Rabbis of blessed memory have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, <i>Pinchas</i> 147.</i> “Proclaim them with [special] food and drink and clean garments;” that is to say, the nature of these [festival] days should not be to you like that of other days, but instead you should make them occasions of holiness, changing them by food and dress from the common to the holy. This is also the opinion of Onkelos [who translated <i>mikra’ei kodesh</i> as “holy events”].

YE SHALL DO NO MANNER OF ‘M’LECHETH AVODAH’ (SERVILE WORK). “[Not] even such work as is considered by you important and necessary work, because the neglect of it would involve a monetary loss, as for example a matter that will not permit delay. So I understood from the Torath Kohanim which teaches as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 12:6.</i> ‘I might think that on intermediate days of the festival<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the mid-festival days, or the half-festive days between the first and the last days of Passover or of Succoth.</i> it is also forbidden to do <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) etc’”<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture therefore states with reference to the first and last days of Passover and of Succoth, that it is on them that servile work is forbidden, but not on the intermediate days of the festival.</i> This is Rashi’s language.<br>But this is not correct at all. For what reason is there that Scripture should say, “Do not do [on the festival days even] such work that will not permit delay,” and [the prohibition for] all other labors be deduced by a <i>kal vachomer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. an argument from minor to major. “If work that will not permit delay is forbidden, then surely it is all the more so forbidden if the work can be delayed till after the festival.” See in Vol. II, p. 133, Note 208, on <i>kal vachomer</i>.</i> and if so it would have been proper to say it in the same way in the case of the Sabbath too! [However, with reference to the Sabbath it says <i>Ye shall do ‘no manner’ of ‘m’lachah’</i> (<i>work</i>), and it does not say <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) as in the case of the festivals!] Moreover, if it be [as Rashi explained it], then there is an allusion in the Torah to the effect that on the intermediate days of the festival it is permissible to do work that will not permit delay, but the Rabbis have said,<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Chagigah 18 a.</i> “Scripture has handed over this matter [of determining which activities are forbidden and which are permitted on the intermediate days of the festival] only to the Sages,” which means that there is no allusion in the Torah as to which work is permitted and which is forbidden! Again, the term <i>avodah</i> (work) includes all kinds of labors and purposes, [as the following verses indicate]: <i>‘oveid’</i> (<i>he that tilleth</i>) <i>his ground shall have plenty of bread;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 12:11.</i> <i>‘va’avadcha’</i> (<i>he shall serve thee</i>) <i>six years;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 15:12.</i> <i>‘v’avad’ta’</i> (<i>thou shalt serve</i>) <i>thine enemy</i><sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:48.</i> — and nowhere does the term <i>avodah</i> mean only work that permits no delay, which, if not done today, can no longer be done on the following day [as Rashi had written]!<br>Rather, the meaning of <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) is all work that is not necessary in the preparation of food, similar to that which it is said, <i>Six days ‘ta’avod</i> (<i>shalt thou labor</i>)<i>, and do all thy work;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:9.</i> <i>and in all ‘avodah’</i> (<i>manner of work</i>) <i>in the field;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:14.</i> <i>‘v’ne’evadtem’</i> (<i>and ye shall be tilled</i>) <i>and sown;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 36:9.</i> <i>but Cain was an ‘oved’</i> (<i>tiller</i>) <i>of the ground</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 4:2.</i> But work which is done in preparation of food is work of direct benefit, and is not [called] <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work). This [distinction] is clearly explained in the Torah. For with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread where He said at first, <i>no manner of work shall be done in them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:16.</i> it was necessary to explain [in the same verse], <i>Save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you;</i> therefore with respect to the other festivals He shortened [the command] and said [as in the verse before us], <i>ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>, thus prohibiting all work which is not done in preparation of food, and informing us that the preparation of food is permissible on the festival days. And in no place does Scripture say concerning any of the festival days, that “no manner of work” [shall be done on it] without explaining [immediately] that the preparation of food is permissible on it, because the form <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) establishes that principle.<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, when the Torah states concerning any festival, “no manner of ‘servile work’ shall be done on it,” that establishes already the permission to prepare necessary food, since such work is not <i>‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> (servile work). But where Scripture states concerning a festival, “no manner ‘of work’ shall be done on it” [an expression which is similar to that stated concerning the Sabbath], then it is always followed with a permission for the preparing of necessary food, since the term “work” is inclusive of all labors.</i> However, in the section of <i>All the firstling males</i><sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 15:19.</i> [where all the festivals are mentioned], He states with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread, <i>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Eternal thy G-d; thou shalt do no work therein</i><sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:8.</i> [and yet Scripture does <i>not</i> follow it up with a permission for preparing food]! The reason for this is that He had already clearly permitted<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">In Exodus 12:16 — quoted above.</i> the preparation of food on it [Passover], and it was therefore no longer necessary [there in the section of <i>All the firstling males</i>] to say in connection with it: “all manner of servile work.” He mentioned there merely “work” (<i>thou shalt do no ‘work’ therein</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:8.</i> and did not say <i>kol m’lachah</i> (“all work” or “any manner of work”) as He said with reference to the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> and the Day of Atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 28.</i> because the intention is, “Do not do that work about which I have admonished you [elsewhere, i.e., ‘servile work’].”<br>Now Rabbi Chananel<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">See above in <i>Seder Kedoshim</i> Note 286. It is important to note that in the printed editions of Ramban the text here is “Rabbi Abraham” (ibn Ezra) instead of “Rabbi [or Rabbeinu] Chananel,” as found in Ramban manuscripts. It is, however, not found at all in Ibn Ezra’s commentaries, thus proving that the correct reading is “Rabbeinu Chananel.” Ramban’s interpretation of the term <i>m’lecheth avodah</i>, as substantiated by Rabbeinu Chananel, has had a wide influence on the whole concept of “work” on the festivals (see an article of mine in “Hadarom,” No. 34, pp. 234-237).</i> wrote: “<i>Do no manner of ‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> (<i>servile work</i>). This teaches that He only permitted [on a festival day] the preparation of food, as it is written in connection with this matter in another place: <i>And in the first day</i> [of Passover] <i>there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:16.</i> And because He mentioned there <i>any manner of work</i> [which indicates a prohibition covering even preparation of food], it was essential that He should explain [in the same verse]: <i>save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you</i>. The meaning of <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> is work for the purpose of material possessions, such as sowing, harvesting, digging and the like, but the preparation of food is not <i>m’lecheth avodah</i>.” This is Rabbeinu Chananel’s language.<br>And the Beraitha in the Torath Kohanim [which Rashi quoted at the beginning of the section] is taught as follows in the correct texts thereof:<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 12:5-8. See also in Vol. II, p. 106, Note 45 on Rabbeinu Chananel.</i> “<i>Do no manner of ‘m’lecheth avodah.’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145, that this is the correct reading here. It is this verse which is clearly referred to by Ramban when he begins the interpretation of the Beraitha.</i> This is intended to elucidate [the law] about the intermediate days of the festival, that it is prohibited to do work on them. I might think that any manner of <i>m’lecheth avodah</i> (servile work) is forbidden on them. Scripture therefore states <i>it</i> [i.e., the eighth day of Tabernacles, <i>is a day of solemn assembly</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145.</i> meaning: <i>it</i> is a day on which all manner of servile work is forbidden, but on the intermediate days [of the festival] such work is not forbidden. These are the words of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiba says: What need is there for Scripture to say: <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 37.</i> If it refers to the festivals, they are each stated [separately]! If so, why is it said, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations</i>? This refers to the intermediate days of the festival, on which the doing of work is forbidden. I might think that all manner of servile work is forbidden to be done on them. Scripture therefore states, <i>it</i> etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145.</i> [as quoted above].<br>The explanation of this Beraitha is [as follows]: Rabbi Yosei the Galilean interprets the verses, <i>Ye shall do</i> [<i>no manner of servile work</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 36. See my Hebrew commentary p. 145.</i> and <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 37.</i> as meaning that Scripture prohibits the doing of work on all [the days] which are termed “the appointed festivals of the Eternal.” Thus I might think that they are all alike with respect to this prohibition, and that any manner of servile work is prohibited to be done on [the intermediate days of the festival] just as on the first and eighth days [of Tabernacles], and [then] we would interpret the verses thus: <i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work. These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 36 and 37 are thus combined to yield this thought.</i> since a verse may be interpreted together with an antecedent phrase or even together with a penultimate phrase.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 32 b. In the case before us, Verse 37 [<i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>] is explained by an antecedent phrase in Verse 36 [<i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>]. Ramban in speaking of “a penultimate phrase” is merely completing the quotation of the Talmudic saying, but the intent here is perforce to “an antecedent phrase.”</i> It is for this reason that Scripture excludes it by saying, <i>‘it’ is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 37.</i> meaning: “the eighth day [of Tabernacles] is restricted as regards all servile work, but on the intermediate days of the festival the prohibition is not like that of [the eighth day], affecting all manner of ‘servile work,’ but it is only ‘work’ which He said they must not do,” and [the precise nature of the work forbidden on the intermediate days of the festival] Scripture did not mention, nor did it allude to it at all, but entrusted it to the Sages [to establish which work is permitted and which is prohibited]. The text which Rashi brings [further on in Verse 36]<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>. I might think that it is forbidden to do servile work also on the intermediate days of the festival. Scripture therefore states <i>it</i> (the eighth day of Tabernacles) <i>is a day of solemn assembly</i> [but not the intermediate days]” (Rashi, Verse 36).</i> is also to be explained in this way.<br>This Beraitha [of the Torath Kohanim] is taught in the Gemara of Tractate Chagigah in the following way:<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Chagigah 18 a.</i> “<i>Ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 8, referring to the seventh day of Passover, which is a full festival day as is the eighth day of Tabernacles.</i> This teaches us about the intermediate days of the festival, that it is forbidden to do work [on them]. These are the words of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean. Rabbi Akiba says etc.” [as quoted above]. And there [in Tractate Chagigah] it is further taught: “Just as [servile work] is forbidden on the seventh day [of Passover], so also it is forbidden on the sixth day; if so [I might think], just as the seventh day is restricted with respect to all work,<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">As it is stated in Deuteronomy 16:8 with reference to the Passover: <i>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly … thou shalt do no work therein</i>. Since it does not state “servile work,” the restriction would seem to apply to “all work,” as the Gemara expresses it. Now Ramban has already explained above that the real intention of this verse in Deuteronomy is “servile work,” and the reason why it mentions “work,” is because Scripture has already explained (in Exodus 12:16 — see Note 215), that it applies specifically to “servile work.” The argument of the Gemara, however, merely proceeds on the basis of the expression as stated there in Deuteronomy. Further on in the text Ramban will again remove this difficulty in accordance with this line of thought, by saying that the Gemara is merely following the expressio of the verse.</i> so also the sixth day [as well as the other intermediate days of the festival] are restricted with respect to all work. Scripture therefore states <i>‘ha’shvi’i’</i>, (<i>‘the’ seventh day</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:8. The definite article in [<i>ha’shvi’i</i>] is limiting, meaning: only on the seventh day are you so restricted, but not on the preceding intermediate days.</i> meaning: “the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, but the sixth day is not restricted with respect to all work, for Scripture entrusted [the determining of which work is permitted and which is forbidden] only to the Sages, etc.” Now the Gemara states that [on the seventh day of the festival we are] restricted against doing “all work,” but the Torath Kohanim [mentioned above] states “all servile work.” This is because in the interpretation [of the Gemara] the Sages chose the wording of the Scriptural text [and since in Deuteronomy 16:8 it says with reference to the seventh day of Passover, <i>thou shalt do no ‘work’ therein</i>, the Gemara followed that expression, but the intention is really only to “servile work”], for with respect to a festival it cannot be said that “all work” is forbidden therein, but only “all servile work.” Thus both [the Torath Kohanim and the Gemara] meant the same thing, namely, that on the festival days all manner of servile work is forbidden, but on the intermediate days of the festival all manner of servile work is not forbidden; however, forbidden are those kinds of labor which [although] have not been set forth in the Torah, but which Scripture entrusted to the Sages [to be specified as forbidden].<br>And in the Sifre [we have been taught]:<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, <i>R’eih</i> 135.</i> “Rabbi Yishmael says: Since we have not been instructed that on the intermediate days of a festival it is forbidden to do work, therefore Scripture states, <i>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:8.</i> [thus teaching that] just as the seventh day is restricted [as regarding work], so also is the sixth day [and all intermediate days of the festival] restricted. Now I might think that just as the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, so also is the sixth day restricted with regard to all work. Scripture therefore states <i>‘the’ seventh day</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:8. The definite article in [<i>ha’shvi’i</i>] is limiting, meaning: only on the seventh day are you so restricted, but not on the preceding intermediate days.</i> thus teaching that the seventh day is restricted with regard to all work, but the sixth day is not restricted with respect to all work.” This Beraitha too [speaking of “all work” being prohibited on the seventh day of Passover] is to be explained in accordance with the principle we have laid down [i.e., that the intention is “all servile work,” the Beraitha merely following the language of the verse, as explained above]. Thus we have discussed at length the matter of the Beraithoth dealing with this subject, in order that the words of our Rabbis, of blessed memory, should conform with the clear and correct interpretation which we have said of these verses.<br>Yet despite all this, I have found a contradiction to our words from a Beraitha taught in the Sifre:<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, <i>Pinchas</i> 147.</i> “<i>Ye shall do no manner of ‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> (<i>servile work</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:18 (with respect to the first day of Passover).</i> This teaches that the doing of work [on the first day of Passover] is forbidden. How do we know that the preparation of food is permitted thereon? Here it is stated <i>a holy convocation</i> [<i>In the first day shall be ‘a holy convocation'; ye shall do no manner of servile work</i>], and there<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">In Exodus 12:16.</i> it is said [with respect to the same day] <i>a holy convocation</i>. Now just as there [the verse explicitly] permits preparing food, so here too the intention is to permit the preparation of food [on the same day].”<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Now this Beraitha is clearly in contradiction to Ramban’s opinion above, that the term <i>‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> (servile work) does <i>not</i> include a prohibition against preparing necessary food on a festival. For if so, seeing that with respect to the first day of Passover it states in Numbers 28:18: <i>Ye shall do no manner of ‘m’lecheth avodah,’</i> why then did the Sifre have to search for a special source to establish the permissibility of preparing necessary food? Ramban will now proceed to remove this contradiction.</i><br>It appears to me that the term <i>avodah</i> was understood by our Rabbis, of blessed memory, in the sense of labor and toil which one does for another, [the usage being] similar to these expressions: <i>‘avodath aved’</i> (<i>the work of a bondservant</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 25:39.</i> <i>‘eved avadim’</i> (<i>a servant of servants</i>) <i>shall he be unto his brethren;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 9:25.</i> <i>‘avdu’</i> (<i>they served</i>) <i>Chedorlaomer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 14:4.</i> Similarly: <i>‘avodath avodah va’avodath masa’</i> (<i>the work of service, and the work of bearing burdens</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 4:47.</i> which means the work of any task in the Tent [of Meeting], and the work of [bearing] burdens upon the shoulder. If so, it would be possible [to think] that light works which one does for one’s own enjoyment are permissible, even though they are not for the preparation of food, while those difficult labors done in the course of preparation of food, which a servant performs for his master, are forbidden to be done. Therefore this [Beraitha just quoted from the Sifre] asked: “Whence do we know that this permission [for certain works] refers to preparation of food, so that all work done in the preparation of food is permissible, even if it involves difficult labor, and that we should prohibit all other kinds of work, for even the easiest of them are called <i>m’lecheth avodah</i>? From the similarity of phrases, <i>a holy convocation</i>, for there<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">In Exodus 12:16.</i> it is indicated that all works [even easy ones] are prohibited, and all works done for the preparation of food [even those difficult tasks that a servant does for his master, such as cooking, baking, etc.] are permitted to be done.”<br>Now I have seen the following text taught in the Mechilta:<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Mechilta, <i>Pis’cha</i> 9.</i> “<i>Save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">In Exodus 12:16.</i> All works necessary for the preparation of food overrule the festival, but not all Services [in the Sanctuary, as will be explained] overrule the festival. Now [the argument may be advanced]: Let some works done for the preparation of food overrule the Sabbath! And the following reasoning would favor it: If in a situation when all Services do not overrule the festival, nonetheless all works necessary for the preparation of food do overrule the festival, then in the situation where some Services [in the Sanctuary] do overrule the Sabbath, is it not logical that some works done for the preparation of food overrule the Sabbath! Scripture therefore states, <i>Save that which every man must eat</i>, [<i>that only may be done by you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">In Exodus 12:16.</i> — on the festival, but not on the Sabbath. It is thus established that although] some Services [in the Sanctuary] overrule the Sabbath, no work for the preparation of food may overrule the Sabbath.” Now the meaning of the phrase [in the Beraitha] “some Services [in the Sanctuary which overrule the Sabbath],” is such things as offerings which are obligatory for the day, these being the Daily Whole-offering and the Additional Offerings; “but the festival is not overruled by all Services [in the Sanctuary],” these are vow-offerings and freewill-offerings [of individuals], or a freewill burnt-offering [which, although wholly for the altar, may yet not be offered on a festival]. But the meaning of the phrase [“is it not logical that] <i>some</i> works for the preparation of food [overrule the Sabbath]” has not been clarified to me. However, it alludes to what we have said, that work which is accomplished by means of great toil, akin to work [which a servant does for his master], is included in the prohibition, but that which is accomplished easily, and is customary for a man to do for himself, is permitted; or “some works” may mean [those necessary] for maintenance of life, and “all works” may mean abundance of dishes for pleasure. The principle then of <i>‘m’lecheth avodah’</i> [servile work — stated in the case of the festivals], is thus to permit the preparation of food [since that is not within the terms of “servile work” which is forbidden on the festival].

Verse 8

AND YE SHALL BRING AN OFFERING MADE BY FIRE UNTO THE ETERNAL SEVEN DAYS. Scripture is stating that all seven days [of Passover] should be a festival <i>to bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">Further. Verse 37.</i> but not that they are all equally forbidden as far as doing work, like on the first and seventh days. He did not explain [here the precise nature of] the offering, since He is going to mention it in a special section dealing with all the offerings of the festivals,<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">These are found in Numbers beginning with 28:9 up to the end of Chapter 29.</i> when it is His wish that they should be binding on the children of Israel, and as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Above on Verse 2.</i> And the interpretation of our Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 10:5.</i> is that [the intention of the verse here] is to state that we are to bring an offering under all circumstances, even if we do not have all the [required] Additional Offerings. This is a correct [explanation].

Verse 9



Verse 10

SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YE ARE COME INTO THE LAND. Since He establishes a new commandment here in connection with each of the festivals, in addition to their being days of rest and holy convocation, therefore He singled out for each festival a special section, which begins with the charge, <i>Speak unto the children of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">So also further on in Verse 24 [in connection with the New Year], and Verse 34 [in connection with the Festival of Tabernacles]. The reason why that expression is not found in connection with the Festival of Weeks and the Day of Atonement will be explained in the text.</i> And since the time of the Festival of Weeks is dependent upon the <i>omer</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a measure.” This refers to the meal-offering of the new barley brought on the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of Nisan. From that day on we count the forty-nine “days of the <i>omer</i>,” and on the fiftieth day is the Festival of Weeks. Thus it is clear that the time of this festival is dependent upon the <i>omer</i>.</i> therefore He stated it all in one section. And because the Day of Remembrance [i.e., the New Year] and the Day of Atonement are in one month [Tishri], and both relate to one subject — the [Divine] Judgment concerning man’s sins and the atonement [achieved] by those who do repentance — therefore He did not say concerning the Day of Atonement “speak unto the children of Israel,” since the first statement [about the New Year] was sufficient in this case. He made, however, two separate sections [of the <i>omer</i> and the Festival of Weeks, as also the New Year and the Day of Atonement], because they are different matters.
AND YE SHALL REAP THE HARVEST THEREOF. This means that you are not to reap <i>any</i> harvest in the Land until you have reaped the <i>omer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a measure.” This refers to the meal-offering of the new barley brought on the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of Nisan. From that day on we count the forty-nine “days of the <i>omer</i>,” and on the fiftieth day is the Festival of Weeks. Thus it is clear that the time of this festival is dependent upon the <i>omer</i>.</i> and have brought it as <i>the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest</i>. Similarly, <i>from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:9.</i> means “from the time you begin to put the sickle to <i>any</i> standing grain, for it is forbidden to raise the sickle over standing grain until the day that you begin to count [seven weeks].”

Verse 11

ON THE MORROW AFTER ‘HA’SHABBATH’ THE PRIEST SHALL WAVE IT. “That is, the morrow after the first day of the Festival of Passover. For if you are to say it means [on the morrow of] the Sabbath of Creation [i.e., the weekly Sabbath], you have no indication which Sabbath is meant.” This is Rashi’s language. And indeed, this is the greatest of the proofs mentioned in the Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 66 a.</i> [to show that <i>ha’shabbath</i> here is not to be interpreted literally as meaning the weekly Sabbath, but refers to the first day of Passover]; for what sense is there for Scripture to state that “<i>when ye are to come into the Land … and shall reap the harvest thereof ye</i> shall bring the sheaf on the morrow of the weekly Sabbath,” which would mean that at any time of the year when we come into the Land and reap its harvest, the priest shall wave the sheaf on the morrow of the first Sabbath after we have come into the Land! In that case the Festival of Weeks would have no [definite] starting point from which we are to count [the forty-nine days, so that on the fiftieth day we should celebrate that festival]! Moreover, according to this way we would not know even in the years following [our entrance into the Land] when we are to begin counting [the forty-nine days], but only from the day that we first put the sickle to the standing grain at our will. But these are meaningless words! If, however, the expression <i>on the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’</i> means “on the morrow after [the first day of] the festival,” in accordance with the tradition of our Rabbis, then the matter appears correctly. For at first Scripture commanded that we should observe in the first month the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days,<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> and that on the first day there should be a solemn rest and on the seventh day a solemn rest,<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s language here follows that of Verse 39 with reference to the eight days of Tabernacles.</i> and we are not to do thereon any manner of servile work. Afterwards He stated that when we come into the Land we are to bring on the morrow of this rest-day [previously] mentioned, <i>the sheaf of the waving</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> this being the first rest-day here mentioned. And He also taught that the [bringing of the] sheaf was not obligatory in the desert, nor outside the Land [since the section begins, <i>When ye are come into the Land</i> …]. However, the expressions, <i>even unto the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’ the seventh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16.</i> and <i>seven ‘shabbathoth’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> cannot possibly be interpreted as referring to a festival [as does the expression <i>on the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’</i> here in Verse 11 and also further in Verse 15.] Onkelos, however, rendered them as meaning “week”, but if so, there are two different usages of the same word in one verse!<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15 reads: <i>And ye shall count unto you from the morrow of ‘ha’shabbath’ … seven ‘shabbathoth’ shall there be complete</i>. According to Onkelos the first <i>ha’shabbath</i> means “the festival,” while the second <i>shabbathoth</i> means “weeks.”</i> And the commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">So interpreted by Ibn Ezra.</i> have written that this is a literary expression [Scripture using one term in the same instance with two different meanings], such as: <i>they rode on thirty ‘a’yarim’</i> (<i>ass colts</i>) <i>and they had thirty ‘a’yarim’</i> (<i>cities</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 10:4. Also quoted by Ramban in Exodus 3:2.</i> And in another place Scripture clearly states, <i>Seven weeks shalt thou number</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:9.</i> Similarly, <i>those that were to come in on ‘ha’shabbath,’ with those that were to go out on ‘ha’shabbath,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 11:9.</i> [where both <i>ha’shabbath</i> mean] “week.” Likewise, <i>Saying: ‘When will the New Moon be gone, that we may sell grain, ‘v’ha’shabbath,’ that we may set forth corn?’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 8:5.</i> [also means “and the week”], for since every seven days contain one Sabbath, and the enumeration of the days is with reference to it [the Sabbath],<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">For thus we say: “This is the first day in the Sabbath, etc.” See Ramban to Exodus 12:2, and 20:8 (Vol. II, pp. 116-7, 313).</i> therefore one week is called “one <i>shabbath</i>”, this usage being well-known and common in the words of our Rabbis, such as: “for twice <i>b’shabbath</i> (in the week) the court sits in towns [on Mondays and on Thursdays].”<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">Kethuboth 2 a.</i><br>It is possible that every <i>shabbath</i> mentioned [here] in the section means “week.” And the meaning of the expression <i>on the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’</i> is that on the day of the waving of the sheaf they should begin counting the week, and if so, that day will be “on the morrow after the week” which has passed, it being as if He had said: “The day of the waving of the sheaf shall be on the morrow after the week with relation to the days that have passed by, and the first with reference to the weeks which he is to count until he finishes seven weeks.” And since He mentioned the expression, <i>and on the fifteenth day</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> He thus states that [the priest] should wave the sheaf on the morrow after the week mentioned, and count therefrom seven weeks. One cannot mistake the expression [<i>ha’shabbath</i>] as referring to the <i>fourteenth</i> day [of Nisan, thus making the offering of the <i>omer</i>, brought on the morrow, to be on the <i>fifteenth</i> day of Nisan, the first day of Passover], for of that fourteenth day He has said that only <i>at dusk</i> [<i>is the Eternal’s Passover</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5. — Thus it is clear that the Festival of Passover begins on the fourteenth of Nisan at dusk, and the first <i>day</i> of the festival is the next day, i.e., the fifteenth. Hence <i>on the morrow after ‘ha’shabbath’</i> must refer to the expression <i>and on the fifteenth day</i> etc. (in Verse 6), thus establishing that it is on the <i>sixteenth</i> day of Nisan that we are to begin a new week — the first of the seven complete weeks.</i> And the meaning of <i>they shall be complete</i><sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> is that a Sabbath together with its six days is called “a whole” Sabbath. And the meaning of the expression <i>mimachorath ha’shabbath</i> [literally: “<i>from</i> the morrow of the <i>shabbath</i>”] is like <i>b’machorath ha’shabbath</i> (“<i>on</i> the morrow of the <i>shabbath</i>”). Similarly, <i>Even unto ‘mimachorath ha’shabbath’ the seventh, shall ye number</i> [<i>fifty days</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “Even unto <i>from</i> the morrow after the seventh week …” This cannot be understood literally, for it would mean that the festival day of Shevuoth is to be observed on the day “<i>from</i> the morrow after the seventh week, i.e., <i>on the following day after the morrow</i> of the seven weeks.” Instead, it must mean: “Even unto <i>on</i> the morrow …”</i> [is like <i>b’machorath ha’shabbath</i> (“<i>on</i> the morrow of the <i>shabbath</i>”)] So also: <i>It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it u’mimachorath</i><sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 19:6. See in my Hebrew commentary p. 148 Note 36.</i> [literally: “and <i>from</i> the morrow,” means <i>u’b'machorath</i> — “and <i>on</i> the morrow]. Scholars<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">I have not identified these scholars.</i> have said that the letter <i>beth</i> cannot occur as a prefix in the word <i>machar</i> (tomorrow) or <i>machorath</i> (the morrow). [Therefore it states], <i>And it came to pass ‘mimachorath’</i> [literally: “<i>from</i> the morrow”] <i>that Moses sat to judge the people</i><sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 18:13.</i> [which means “<i>on</i> the morrow”]. <i>And the Eternal did that thing ‘mimachorath’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:6.</i> [literally: “<i>from</i> the morrow,” which means “<i>on</i> the morrow”], and similarly all such expressions.

Verse 15

AND YE SHALL COUNT ‘LACHEM’ (UNTO YOU). The meaning thereof is similar to the expression <i>And ye shall take ‘lachem,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 40.</i> thus establishing that the counting [of the forty-nine days of the <i>omer</i>] and the taking [of the <i>lulav, ethrog</i> etc. on the Festival of Tabernacles] be done by each and every person. Thus the counting must be done by word of mouth, and he should mention the number, just as our Rabbis have received it by tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">This may refer to what the Rabbis have said: “It is obligatory to count the days, and it is obligatory to count the weeks” (Menachoth 66 a). Thus we say e.g., “This is the tenth day, making one week and three days of the <i>omer</i>.”</i> This is unlike the expressions <i>and he shall count ‘lo’</i> (<i>to himself</i>) <i>seven days for his cleansing;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 15:13.</i> <i>then she shall number ‘lah’</i> (<i>to herself</i>) seven days<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 28.</i> [referring to a man or woman who suffered a flux, in which case the counting of the clean days does not have to be uttered by word of mouth], because if they so wish, they may remain in their impurity; they must only beware not to forget their impurity [and enter the Sanctuary or eat holy food in a state of defilement, which Scripture strongly forbids].<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">But otherwise the man or woman suffering a flux [i.e., <i>zav</i> or <i>zavah</i>] is under no obligation to proceed with the purification. Hence “the counting” of the seven clean days which the Torah mentioned that they must do could not be in the nature of a positive act — counting by word of mouth — but merely a warning that they should not forget their state of impurity. However, in the case of the counting of the <i>omer</i>, this reasoning is inapplicable, since the observance of Shevuoth on the fiftieth day is not a matter of choice, hence “the counting” must mean by word of mouth.</i> Similarly, <i>And thou shall number ‘lecha’</i> (<i>unto thee</i>) <i>seven Sabbaths of years</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Further 25:8.</i> of the Jubilee, means [only] that you shall be heedful of the number so that you should not forget [when the Jubilee year falls, but the actual counting of the years does not have to be by word of mouth]. But in the Torath Kohanim I have found it said:<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 2:1.</i> “<i>And thou shalt number unto thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Further 25:8.</i> — in the court.” Now I do not know if the intention is to state that the Great Court [of seventy-one judges] is obliged [actually] to count the years and the Sabbatical cycles<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the counting would be done e.g., in the following manner: “This year is the twentieth year, making two Sabbatical cycles and six years of the Jubilee.” See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 148-149.</i> at the beginning of every year, and to recite a benediction before the counting as we do at the counting [of the forty-nine days] of the <i>omer</i>; or it may be that the intention [of the Torath Kohanim] is to state that the court should be careful in the counting of the years, and sanctify the fiftieth year.<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>, p. 144.</i> Thus the number of days from the day of the waving of the <i>omer</i> until the day of <i>the holy convocation</i> [i.e., the Festival of Weeks], is identical to the number of years of the [seven] Sabbatical cycles until the Jubilee, and the reason for them is the same. Therefore <i>ye shall number fifty days</i><sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 16.</i> which means that one is to count seven weeks [comprising] forty-nine days,<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps the thought conveyed here is as explained above (in Verse 11) that these seven weeks are not determined from the start of the regular cycle of weeks, but by these forty-nine days which are counted from the day of the waving of the sheaf, on whatever day of the week it may take place.</i> and sanctify the fiftieth day which he has counted [and make it a holy convocation], just as He said with respect to the Jubilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Further 25:8.</i> This is the meaning of the word <i>t’mimoth</i> (complete) — [<i>seven weeks shall there be ‘complete’</i>], meaning that they be exactly that number, no less and no more, just as is the meaning of the expression: <i>they shall be perfect</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:19.</i> for anything additional or missing makes a thing imperfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">The thought is similar to a principle stated by the Sages: “Every addition of a limb is considered equivalent to the entire absence of the respective limb [in an animal or fowl]” (Chullin 58 b).</i> Thus the explanation of this section is that we are to begin counting the days <i>in the beginning of the barley harvest</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth 1:22.</i> and bring of the first fruits of the harvest, <i>of the fresh ears</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 2:14.</i> a meal-offering unto the Eternal, and also to offer up with it an offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">As specified in Verse 12: <i>And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto the Eternal</i>.</i> and to finish the counting of the days in the beginning of the corn harvest, <i>as a shock of grain cometh up in its season</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">Job 5:26.</i> and bring of it a meal-offering of fine corn flour unto the Eternal, and to offer with it also an offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">As specified in Verse 18: <i>And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs …</i></i> This is the reason why He mentioned these offerings in this section, because they are brought on account of the meal-offerings which are the main [commandment] of these festivals, but He did not mention the Additional Offerings brought on these festivals [which are enumerated in the Book of Numbers],<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:18-31.</i> even as He did not mention those of the rest of the festivals.

Verse 16

AND YE SHALL OFFER A NEW MEAL-OFFERING UNTO THE ETERNAL. The meaning of the expression <i>a new meal-offering</i> is that no meal-offering [of the new crop] is to be brought into G-d’s House until they bring this one, as our Rabbis have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 68 b: “The <i>omer</i> [the meal-offering of <i>barley</i> brought on the second day of Passover] made the new crop permissible in the country [i.e., for private consumption], and ‘the two loaves’ [which were brought on the Festival of Weeks] made it permissible for use in the Sanctuary.”</i> It was necessary for Scripture to state, <i>it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings</i><sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14.</i> with reference to the prohibition of [eating of] the new crop and the command to rest [from work] on the Festival of Weeks,<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> because [the prohibition of eating of the new crop] depends on the waving of the sheaf,<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">When the Sanctuary stood, the offering of the <i>omer</i> at any time on the sixteenth day of Nisan at once rendered <i>chadash</i> (the new crop) permissible food. Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188).</i> [and the Festival of Weeks is connected] with <i>the new meal-offering</i> [mentioned in the verse before us]. Thus this verse is intended to state that even after our exile to countries outside the Land, when the <i>omer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a measure.” This refers to the meal-offering of the new barley brought on the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of Nisan. From that day on we count the forty-nine “days of the <i>omer</i>,” and on the fiftieth day is the Festival of Weeks. Thus it is clear that the time of this festival is dependent upon the <i>omer</i>.</i> and the [new] meal-offering are no longer offered, He nonetheless commanded concerning the observance [of the law of the new crop and resting on the festival], for the [prohibition against eating of the] new crop applies by law of the Torah in all places. It was not necessary to mention this in connection with the Day of Remembrance [i.e., the New Year], and similarly in connection with the Festival of Tabernacles He did not mention [that it is to be observed] “in all your dwellings” [because these two festivals are clearly not dependent upon the offerings in the Sanctuary]. He did, however, mention it with reference to the Day of Atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> because since He had made our atonement dependent upon the offerings, as he mentioned in the section of <i>Acharei Moth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Chapter 16.</i> therefore He said here that the prohibition [of eating and working on that day] applies in all places [and at all times], as He stated <i>it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 28.</i> by fasting and resting from work, and [the absence of] the offerings does not prevent His [granting of] atonement. Similarly He did not mention here with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread: “it is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations,” but in the section of <i>This month shall be unto you the beginning of months</i><sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:2.</i> He did mention it,<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 14 and 17.</i> because since He had made there the matter dependent upon the Passover-offering, as it is said, <i>and unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8. See in my Hebrew commentary, p. 149, Note 60.</i> therefore He had to state that [the Festival of Unleavened Bread] is <i>an ordinance forever</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 14.</i> <i>in all your habitations</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> He mentioned [here] with reference to the Sabbath that it is to be observed <i>in all your dwellings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 3.</i> because since He had permitted work in the Sanctuary in the bringing of the Daily Whole-offering and the Additional Offerings, therefore He said that the prohibition [of work on the Sabbath] applies in all our dwelling places; for the intention of that expression is only to state: “<i>in all your dwelling places</i>, but not in the House of the Eternal.” And so the Rabbis have said in the Mechilta:<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">Mechilta, <i>Vayakheil</i> 1.</i> “<i>Ye shall kindle no fire in your dwelling places</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 35:3.</i> In your dwelling places you may not kindle a fire, but you may kindle it in the Sanctuary.” Similarly it says with reference to the prohibition of [eating] fat or blood, <i>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 3:17.</i> because it was prohibited on account of the offerings, [therefore He stated that this prohibition is nonetheless independent of the offerings, and applies always and everywhere]. And so the Rabbis have said in Tractate Kiddushin:<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 37 b.</i> “Why did the Merciful One write the expression <i>in all your dwellings</i><sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 3:17.</i> in connection with [the prohibition against eating] fat or blood? It is because I might have thought that since this prohibition is written in connection with the offerings, therefore when there are offerings [i.e., when the Sanctuary is in existence] the prohibition is applicable, and when there are no offerings it is not applicable, thus the Torah wanted to teach us [that it is always applicable].” There [in Tractate Kiddushin]<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 37 b.</i> the Rabbis also said: “Why did the Merciful One write [here in this section — in Verse 3] the expression <i>in all your dwellings</i> with reference to the Sabbath? It is because I might have thought that since it is written in connection with the festivals, the Sabbath should require sanctification by the court just as the festivals do, therefore the Torah wanted to teach us [that the Sabbath is independent of sanctification by the court]. The principle then is that the Torah does not mention this expression [<i>in all your dwellings</i>] with reference to any commandment which is a personal obligation, unless there is a necessity for some reason.<br>Now the expression: <i>‘out of your dwellings’ ye shall bring two wave-loaves</i><sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 17.</i> [on the Festival of Weeks], is not similar to “out of <i>all</i> your dwellings.” Rather, its meaning is: “<i>out of</i> the Land of <i>your dwellings</i>,” excluding [the obligation to bring two loaves from the produce of] outside the Land of Israel, just as it is said, <i>When ye come into the Land of your habitations which I give unto you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers, 15:2.</i> And so the Rabbis have taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">Menachoth 83 b.</i> “All the [meal-]offerings of the public or of an individual may come from the produce of the Land or outside the Land, save only the <i>omer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a measure.” This refers to the meal-offering of the new barley brought on the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of Nisan. From that day on we count the forty-nine “days of the <i>omer</i>,” and on the fiftieth day is the Festival of Weeks. Thus it is clear that the time of this festival is dependent upon the <i>omer</i>.</i> and the two loaves.”<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 17.</i> And even according to the Sage who says<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 84 a. The Sage is Rabbi Josei the son of Rabbi Yehudah.</i> that the <i>omer</i> may be brought from the produce of outside the Land, he admits in the case of the two loaves [brought on the Festival of Weeks] that they may be offered only from what is grown within the Land [of Israel].

Verse 17

THEY SHALL BE BAKED WITH LEAVEN. Scripture commanded that these two loaves be leavened, because they are a thanks-offering to G-d for having kept for us <i>the appointed time of the harvest</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">See Jeremiah 5:24.</i> and a thanks-offering comes <i>with cakes of leavened bread</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 7:13 — It is important to note that neither the two leavened loaves of the Festival of Weeks nor the leavened cakes of a thanks-offering were burnt on the altar, as leaven is forbidden to be burnt on the altar. They were merely brought into the Sanctuary Court as part of the offering, but they were eaten by the priests.</i> Perhaps the [usual] prohibition of bringing leavened things as an offering<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 2:11.</i> is because leaven alludes to the attribute of justice, for it is called <i>chametz</i> (leaven), just as wine which sours is called <i>‘chometz yayin v’chometz sheichar’</i> (<i>vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:3.</i> the word [<i>chametz</i>] being derived from the expression: <i>the unrighteous ‘v’chomeitz’</i> (<i>and ruthless man</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 71:4.</i> for [vinegar of wine and vinegar of strong drink] are drinks whose original taste has been “robbed” from them, and they are therefore not suitable for [normal] drinking. Similarly, <i>for my heart yithchameitz’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 73:21.</i> means that it was “in a ferment, and it lost its composure.” Now since the offerings are brought to be acceptable before <i>the Glorious Name</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:58. See Ramban above, 1:9 (towards the end).</i> they are therefore not to be brought from objects which possess a strong power<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">Alluding to the attribute of stern justice (Tziyoni).</i> to change natural properties of other things [such as leaven], and similarly they are not to be brought from things which are completely sweet<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">Alluding to everlasting mercy (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> such as honey. [Instead, they are to come] only from things which are blended of different qualities, just as the Rabbis have said with reference to the creation of the world<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshith Rabbah 12:15. The language here is that of Rashi on Genesis 1:1.</i> “He combined the attribute of mercy with the attribute of justice, and created the world.” Now on the Festival of Weeks which is the day of the Giving of the Torah [on Mount Sinai], the offering [i.e., the two <i>leavened</i> loaves and the various burnt-offerings, together with their meal-offering which is of <i>unleavened</i> bread, as stated in Verse 18] comes in accordance with the law of the thanks-offering [which was brought with ten <i>leavened</i> cakes and thirty <i>unleavened</i> cakes],<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 7:12-13. See Ramban there on Verse 12.</i> for it is the day of the solemn assembly. The student learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand. And this is the secret of which our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 9:3.</i> “All offerings are destined to cease [in the World to Come],<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote">This is generally understood as meaning that since there will be no sin in the World to Come, there will not be an occasion to bring the sin-offering etc. See Ramban above, 1:4 that the burnt-offering, too, atones for sin. But for the thanks-offering there will always be an occasion. Ramban, however, alludes to a mystic interpretation, namely, that since the World to Come represents the life of perfect harmony, it is symbolized by the thanks-offering in which the leavened and the unleavened are combined, whereas in the present world justice and mercy are not always combined (see Ramban further, on Verse 24 towards the end, about the nature of the New Year and the Day of Atonement).</i> but the thanks-offering will never cease etc.,” for in it are both unleavened and leavened [cakes], comparable to the World to Come [in which the Divine attributes of justice and mercy will forever be in perfect harmony].

AND WHEN YE REAP THE HARVEST OF YOUR LAND, THOU SHALT NOT WHOLLY REAP THE CORNER OF THY FIELD, NEITHER SHALT THOU GATHER THY GLEANING OF THY HARVEST: THOU SHALT LEAVE THEM FOR THE POOR. Rashi comments: “He repeats once more these prohibitions [although they have been mentioned above, 19:9] in order to make one liable for transgressing two negative commandments [in each case].” And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the reason [for the repetition] is because the Festival of Weeks is the day on which <i>the first-fruits of wheat harvest</i><sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:22.</i> [are brought as a meal-offering, in the form of the two leavened loaves], therefore He warned that “you should not forget what I have commanded you to do in those days.” The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the expression, <i>And when ye reap the harvest of your Land</i> alludes to “the harvest” mentioned at the beginning of this section,<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 10.</i> thus stating that when you will come into the Land and you reap the sheaf, <i>the first-fruits of your harvest</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 10.</i> <i>thou shalt not wholly r,eap the corner</i> of that field for the sake of the sheaf, neither shall you gather the gleaning, meaning to say that this commandment [of bringing the <i>omer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: “a measure.” This refers to the meal-offering of the new barley brought on the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of Nisan. From that day on we count the forty-nine “days of the <i>omer</i>,” and on the fiftieth day is the Festival of Weeks. Thus it is clear that the time of this festival is dependent upon the <i>omer</i>.</i>] does not override these negative commandments.

Verse 23



Verse 24

IT SHALL BE UNTO YOU ‘SHABBATHON’ (A SOLEMN REST). This means that it is to be a day of rest, to repose thereon [from work]. And our Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbath 24 b.</i> “The word <i>shabbathon</i> (a solemn rest) amounts to a positive commandment.” Thus one who does work on a festival day transgresses both a negative commandment and a positive commandment, and one who rests thereon fulfills a positive commandment. And in their opinion [that of the Rabbis],<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 10 a.</i> all the festivals have been likened one to another,<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">This is alluded to in the vecse, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i> (above, Verse 4), thus teaching that all festivals are alike with respect to a positive commandment [to rest thereon] and a negative commandment [not to do work], even though in the case of some festivals, [as the text continues], the positive commandment is not clearly set forth in Scripture.</i> for the word <i>shabbathon</i> is not mentioned in connection with the Festival of Unleavened Bread, nor in connection with the Festival of Weeks.<br>Now in the Mechilta on the section of <i>Hachodesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:2.</i> I have seen the following text:<sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote">Mechilta, <i>Pis’cha</i> 9.</i> “<i>And ye shall observe this day</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">323</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:17.</i> Why is this said? Has it not already been stated, <i>no manner of work shall be done in them?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">324</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> From this I would know only about matters which are considered <i>m’lachah</i> [‘work’ on the Sabbath, and thus forbidden by the Torah]. How do I know about activities which are termed <i>sh’vuth</i> [as explained later on]? From the verse which states, <i>and ye shall observe this day</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">323</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:17.</i> which includes those activities which are termed <i>sh’vuth</i>. I might then think that on the intermediate days of the festival those activities known as <i>sh’vuth</i> are likewise forbidden, and the following reasoning would favor it etc;<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">“Since the expression <i>holy convocation</i> is stated both with reference to the first and seventh days of Passover (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 16), and the intermediate days of the festival are similarly termed [in the verse, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal, even holy convocations</i> — Verse 4 in the section before us], therefore just as activities called <i>sh’vuth</i> are forbidden on the first and seventh days, so are they also forbidden on the intermediate days of the festival.” — So it could be argued.</i> Scripture therefore states [with reference to the Festival of Tabernacles], <i>On the first day shall be a solemn rest</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 39.</i> [but not on the following intermediate days of the festival].<br>Thus the Sages interpreted the word <i>shabbathon</i> as indicating a complete rest on that day, desisting even from those activities which are not of the chief labors or their derivatives. But this interpretation is not clear to me. For if you say that this Mechilta is a mere Scriptural support for a Rabbinic ordinance, what reason is there for the Rabbis to use this language [i.e., “How do I know about activities which are termed <i>sh’vuth</i>?” when instead they should have said, “How do I know about activities which are not regarded as <i>m’lachah?</i>”], for the term <i>sh’vuth</i> in the language of the Sages is always used with reference to activities forbidden by the Rabbis; and so how is it possible to say, “How do I know that activities which are forbidden on account of <i>sh’vuth</i> instituted by the Rabbis, are forbidden on the basis of a verse [in Scripture]!” The way in which such [Beraithoth make use of] Scriptural texts as a support for Rabbinical enactments, is by teaching [an interpretation in a verse] showing that they [such Rabbinical enactments] are based on the Torah, but they never say, “That activity which is forbidden by the Sages, from what verse in the Torah do we derive it?” Instead, this [Beraitha of the Mechilta] should have stated, “Activities which are not in the category of <i>m’lachah</i> (‘work’),<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote">There are thirty-nine main classes of “work” (Shabbath 73 a). Their subspecies are also subject to the same regulations (Baba Kama 2 a). The intention here, then, is to find a source for such kinds of activity which are neither “work” nor any of its derivatives. Examples are mentioned further on in the text.</i> whence do we know that they are forbidden? From the word <i>shabbathon</i>!”<br>It appears to me that this interpretation intends to state that we are commanded by law of the Torah to have rest on a festival day even from activities which are not in the category of <i>m’lachah</i> (“work”).<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote">There are thirty-nine main classes of “work” (Shabbath 73 a). Their subspecies are also subject to the same regulations (Baba Kama 2 a). The intention here, then, is to find a source for such kinds of activity which are neither “work” nor any of its derivatives. Examples are mentioned further on in the text.</i><br>Thus we are not to be engaged the whole day in wearisome tasks: measuring out crops of the field, weighing fruits and gifts, filling the barrels with wine and clearing away the vessels, and moving stones from house to house and from place to place [although none of these activities is “work” in the strict sense of the term]. Similarly, if it be a city encompassed by a wall and its gates are locked at night, [and it is therefore according to law of the Torah treated as one domain, and the prohibition against taking out aught from one domain to another is inapplicable there], they would be loading heaps on asses, <i>as also wine, grapes, and figs and all manner of burdens</i><sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 13:15.</i> they would bring on a festival; and the market place would be full for all business transactions, the shops standing open and the shopkeepers giving credit,<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 3:16.</i> the money-changers sitting before their tables with the golden coins before them, and the workers would rise early to go to their work and hire themselves out for such works [as described above] just as on weekdays, and so on! And since all these matters do not entail <i>m’lachah</i>, they would be permissible on a festival day and even on the Sabbath itself! Therefore the Torah said that [the festival should be a day of] <i>shabbathon</i> (solemn rest), meaning that it should be a day of rest and ease, not a day of labor [and weariness]. This is a good and beautiful interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban in Exodus 12:16 (towards the end) where he refers to this interpretation that he intended yet to write, and see also there, p. 134, Note 213.</i><br>Afterwards I saw the other Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai<sup class="footnote-marker">331</sup><i class="footnote">The standard Mechilta being that of Rabbi Yishmael [a colleague of Rabbi Akiba], Ramban here refers to another Mechilta which he specifies by name: “the Mechilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai.” Hence the epithet “the other Mechilta.” [See, however, in Vol. I, p. 603, where this epithet is not used by Ramban.] Rabbi Shimon was a pupil of Rabbi Akiba. The text quoted is found in that work on Exodus 12:16.</i> where it is taught in another form: “I know only that it is forbidden [on a festival day to do] the kind of work for which, [if transgressed on the Sabbath through error], one must bring a sin-offering. How do I know that [it is forbidden to do] such works [on a festival day] for which one does not have to bring a sin-offering [if transgressed through error on the Sabbath], such as climbing a tree or riding on animals or swimming in the water, or slapping one’s thighs or clapping one’s hands? From the verse, <i>no manner of work shall be done in them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:16, stated with reference to the first and seventh days of Passover.</i> I know only concerning acts of [one’s own] choice. How do I know concerning acts commanded [in the Torah], that we may not dedicate anything [to the Temple treasury], or make a vow of valuation, or devote anything [for Temple repairs, or for the priests], or set apart the heave-offering or the tithes? From the expression <i>shabbathon</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">333</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 24 before us with reference to the New Year, and as explained above all festivals have been likened one to another. See Note 320.</i> which means <i>sh’vuth</i>” (rest, abstention from ordinary occupation). In a similar way this [Beraitha] is taught in the Torath Kohanim with reference to the Day of Atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">334</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Acharei</i> 7:9.</i> Now although these Beraithoth<sup class="footnote-marker">335</sup><i class="footnote">On the meaning of this term see above in <i>Seder Vayikra</i>, Note 65.</i> differ in their language and in their interpretations, perhaps they all intend one common thing, namely, to find some Scriptural support for activities forbidden by the Rabbis. But nonetheless, whether the interpretation of the first Beraitha [mentioned above] be as we have said [i.e., that it is forbidden by <i>Scriptural law</i> to do on a festival day activities which are not strictly speaking “work,” but are wearisome labors], or whether all [these Beraithoth] intend only to find a Scriptural support for matters forbidden by the Rabbis, the meaning of the term <i>shabbathon</i> is as we have explained, namely, that we should have a day of repose from labor and toil. This is indeed a very proper and excellent interpretation.<br>Thus we have been prohibited from doing [any of the main classes of] “work” on the Sabbath by a negative commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">336</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:10.</i> and [for the intentional transgression thereof is prescribed] the punishment of excision [if the court has no knowledge of the transgression or there are no witnesses, but if there are witnesses who testify, the punishment] is death — but as for labors and toils [which are not strictly speaking “work”], we are commanded by means of this positive commandment;<sup class="footnote-marker">337</sup><i class="footnote">For of the Sabbath it is likewise said <i>shabbathon</i> (here in Verse 3): <i>Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh it is a Sabbath of ‘shabbathon’</i> (<i>solemn rest</i>).</i> and on a festival day we are prohibited from doing “work” by a negative commandment, [the punishment for the intentional transgression thereof being whipping], and the doing of labors [which are not strictly speaking “work”] we are forbidden by means of a positive commandment. It is on this basis that the prophet [Isaiah] said, <i>If thou turn away thy foot because of the Sabbath, from pursuing thy business on My holy day … not doing thy wonted ways, nor pursuing thy business, nor speaking thereof;</i> [<i>then shalt thou delight thyself in the Eternal</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">338</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 58:13-14.</i> Similarly, <i>a Sabbath of ‘shabbathon’</i> (<i>solemn rest</i>) <i>shall be for the Land</i><sup class="footnote-marker">339</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 25:4.</i> means that [the seventh year] shall be a Sabbath of rest, that one is not to plow nor cultivate the Land at all. It is because of this that the Sages have interpreted [in the first Beraitha mentioned above] that on the intermediate days of the festival those activities known as <i>sh’vuth</i> are not forbidden. But this is only according to the law of the Torah, for by Rabbinic enactment whatever one may not do oneself one is not permitted to say to a non-Jew to do, since even with reference to the Rabbinic prohibition against telling [a non-Jew to do work], the Sages were strict [in not permitting it on an intermediate day of the festival].<sup class="footnote-marker">340</sup><i class="footnote">Moed Katan 12 a. Thus since the Rabbis forbade even a <i>sh’vuth</i> involving only speech, it is clear that they prohibited every <i>sh’vuth</i> involving action.</i>
A MEMORIAL OF T’RUAH’ (A BLAST OF THE RAM’S HORN) — “[a memorial by means of recitation of] Biblical verses which tell of Divine Remembrance, and verses which have reference to the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> [the ram’s horn], so that I shall recall in memory for your sake the Binding of Isaac, instead of whom a ram was offered.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>Now the Rabbi [Rashi] should have mentioned also the Rabbinic interpretation for the recitation of verses in which the Sovereignty of G-d is described,<sup class="footnote-marker">341</sup><i class="footnote">In the Additional Service of the New Year, ten Biblical verses which speak of G-d as King of the universe are recited; so also ten verses which speak of Divine Remembrance, and ten which speak of the role of the <i>Shofar</i>. See in Vol. I, p. 268 Note 318.</i> for it is impossible that Scripture should mention the verses of Divine Remembrance and of the <i>Shofar</i>, and should not mention also the verses of Sovereignty. And the Sages have already derived [the duty of reciting] them from the verse, <i>And they shall be to you for a memorial before your G-d: I am the Eternal your G-d:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">342</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 10:10.</i> “There was no need for Scripture to state here, <i>I am the Eternal your G-d</i>. And why does it state <i>I am the Eternal your G-d?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 9 <i>ibid.</i>, it states already, <i>and ye shall be remembered before the Eternal your G-d</i>. Why then is it said in Verse 10 again, <i>I am the Eternal your G-d?</i></i> It is stated only to establish a general law, that wherever you recite verses of Divine Remembrance you recite next to them those of Sovereignty,” as it is taught in Torath Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">344</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 11:2.</i> and in Tractate Rosh Hashanah.<sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 32 a.</i> However, all these interpretations are only Scriptural supports for Rabbinic enactments. For the Rabbis have explicitly said:<sup class="footnote-marker">346</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34 b. The Gemara there brings a Beraitha as follows: “If there are two cities, in one of which they blow the <i>Shofar</i> [but there is no-one who can recite the Additional Service of the New Year with the special verses about G-d’s Sovereignty etc.], and in the other they recite the Service but have no <i>Shofar</i>, then we are to go” etc., as Ramban continues.</i> “We are to go to the place where they blow the <i>Shofar</i>, and we are not to go to the place where they recite the Service” [without the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i>. On this statement of the Beraitha the Rabbis of the Gemara asked:] “Surely this is so! The blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> is commanded by law of the Torah, and the recitation of the verses is only by law of the Rabbis [and what need is there for the Beraitha to teach me that the law of the Torah takes precedence!” To this the Gemara answered: “The Beraitha is] necessary only to teach this in a case where one is certain and one is in doubt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">347</sup><i class="footnote">Even if there is only a doubt whether there will be a <i>Shofar</i> in one community, whilst in the other it is certain that they will recite the Service, but without the sounding of the <i>Shofar</i>, the Beraitha teaches that we are yet to go to the place where there is a possibility of the <i>Shofar</i> being blown, even though there is a doubt about it.</i><br>Rather, the expression <i>a memorial of ‘t’ruah’</i> is like the verse, <i>it shall be a day of ‘t’ruah’ unto you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">348</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 29:1.</i> Scripture stating that we are to blow [the <i>Shofar</i>] on that day, and this shall be to us for a memorial before G-d, as it is said further on, <i>and ye shall blow with the trumpets</i> [<i>over your burnt-offerings, and over the offerings of your peace-offerings</i>]<i>, and they shall be to you for a memorial before your G-d</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">342</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 10:10.</i> And since He said there, <i>And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your New Moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the offerings of your peace-offerings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">342</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 10:10.</i> whereas here He commanded only a <i>t’ruah</i> [a blast of the horn] for this festival [the New Year], and following it He said, <i>and ye shall bring an offering made by fire</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">349</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 25 here.</i> we deduce that this <i>t’ruah</i> [mentioned here] is not the same blowing which was done with the [silver] trumpets over the offerings. We furthermore [deduce] that this <i>t’ruah</i> here was not done over the offerings, but it is obligatory upon all Israel [wherever they are], and is to be done with the <i>Shofar</i> [the ram’s horn], for he had not yet commanded him [Moses] to make the trumpets, and all unqualified expressions of <i>t’ruah</i> are done with the <i>Shofar</i>, as it is said, <i>And thou shalt make proclamation with ‘shofar t’ruah’</i> (<i>the blast of the horn</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">350</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 25:9.</i><br>Now Scripture did not explain the reason for this commandment, why [we must do] the blowing [of the horn], and why we need a memorial before G-d on this day more than on all other days, and why He commanded altogether that this day should be a holy convocation. But because this day comes at the beginning of the month in which the Day of Atonement occurs, it would appear that on the New Year there is a judgment before Him, blessed be He, <i>for by these He judgeth the peoples</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">351</sup><i class="footnote">Job 36:31.</i> on the New Year He sits <i>upon the throne as the righteous Judge</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">352</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 9:5.</i> and afterwards in the course of the next ten days He forgives the transgression of His servants.<sup class="footnote-marker">353</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 50:17.</i> Scripture is thus alluding to this matter which is well-known in Israel by word of the prophets and our holy ancestors.<sup class="footnote-marker">354</sup><i class="footnote">“Up to Moses our teacher, and it is still with us as a matter of tradition and as is known in the Talmud.

ACH’ (BUT) ON THE TENTH DAY OF THIS SEVENTH MONTH IS THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. “All expressions in the Torah of <i>ach</i> (but) and <i>rak</i> (only) indicate limiting qualifications, [and here the word <i>ach</i> indicates that the Day of Atonement] effects atonement ‘only’ for those who repent, but it does not effect atonement for those who do not repent.” This is Rashi’s language on the basis of the words of our Rabbis.<sup class="footnote-marker">375</sup><i class="footnote">Shebuoth 13 a.</i> And if so, the explanation of the verse is that on the first day of this month [Tishri] there will be for all of you a day of <i>memorial of ‘t’ruah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">376</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 24.</i> [a blowing of the quavering sound which signifies judgment], for you will all be judged then before Him, but for some of you [i.e., those who repent] there will be on the tenth day of this month a day of atonement. Thus the meaning of the word <i>ach</i> is like that of <i>bilvad</i> (“only,” “alone”). Similarly, <i>Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my son ‘ach’</i> (<i>only</i>) <i>this once</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">377</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 10:17.</i> So also, <i>‘harak ach b’Moshe’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">378</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 12:2.</i> means “has He indeed spoken ‘only’ with Moses?” Likewise, <i>‘Ach’ on the fifteenth day of the seventh month</i><sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 39.</i> means “only on the fifteenth day [of Tishri] <i>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal seven days</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 39.</i> not consecutively,” for the Festival-offering [brought by the individual]<sup class="footnote-marker">380</sup><i class="footnote">This is the Festival peace-offering which one is obliged to bring when making the pilgrimage to the Sanctuary three times in the year (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 60-61).</i> does not override the Sabbath [and therefore it cannot mean seven days consecutively]. In the same way you are to explain [the word <i>ach</i>] in all the commandments, in accordance with the tradition of our Rabbis. Similarly, <i>‘ach’ he is torn in pieces</i><sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 44:28.</i> means [that Jacob said] that nothing else [could have happened to Joseph] except that he was torn in pieces. So also, <i>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah ‘ach’ have done that which was evil in My sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have ‘ach’ provoked Me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">382</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 32:30.</i> means that they have done nothing else.<br>But by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the word <i>ach</i> means <i>achein</i> (“surely”), [a word which is used] to authenticate something, [as in the following expressions]: <i>‘achein’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>the thing is known;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">383</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 2:14.</i> <i>‘achein’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>ye shall die like men</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">384</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 82:7.</i> And here it means, “Surely on the tenth day of the seventh month is the day of atonement,” the expression constituting a [Divine] assurance on the authenticity of the matter, Scripture stating: “On the first day of the month is the day of judgment, but indeed on the tenth of the month is the day of atonement, therefore you shall afflict your souls, and you shall do no manner of work.” Similarly, <i>‘ach’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>thou art my bone and my flesh;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">385</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 29:14.</i> <i>‘ach’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>it is the king of Israel;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">386</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 22:32.</i> <i>‘ach’</i> (<i>surely</i>) <i>G-d is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">387</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 73:1.</i> So also is the meaning of the verse, <i>‘ach’ ye shall keep My Sabbaths</i><sup class="footnote-marker">388</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 31:13.</i> which declares: “Now I have commanded you concerning the work of the Tabernacle, but surely My Sabbaths you shall keep forever.” So also in all cases [where the word <i>ach</i> is mentioned] it may be explained to you in this way, if you will understand them.

Verse 28

B’ETZEM’ OF THIS DAY. The commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">389</sup><i class="footnote">R’dak in his Sefer Hashorashim, (Book or Roots), root <i>etzem</i>.</i> have said that the meaning of this phrase is “in this selfsame day.” Similarly, <i>and ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears until ‘etzem’ this day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 14.</i> means “until this selfsame day.” So also, <i>‘uch’etzem’ the heaven for clearness</i><sup class="footnote-marker">391</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:10.</i> means “the very” heaven. But we cannot interpret that the word <i>b’etzem</i> here alludes to the essence and power of this day<sup class="footnote-marker">392</sup><i class="footnote">And in that case the verse would be stating: “You shall do no manner of work in the essence of the day, meaning at daytime.” That interpretation would be incorrect, as the text continues.</i> [which is at daytime], just as our Rabbis have said with reference to the verses: <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day entered Noah</i> … <i>into the ark</i><sup class="footnote-marker">393</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 7:13.</i> [which the Rabbis interpreted to mean<sup class="footnote-marker">394</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, <i>Ha’azinu</i> 332.</i> that because the neighbors threatened to kill him and destroy the ark should they see him entering it, therefore G-d told him to enter it <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> — in broad daylight]; <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day the Eternal did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt</i><sup class="footnote-marker">395</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:51.</i> [which the Rabbis similarly interpreted<sup class="footnote-marker">394</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, <i>Ha’azinu</i> 332.</i> “in broad daylight,” because of the previous threats of the Egyptians not to let them go — such an interpretation we cannot assume here], for it is written, <i>and ye shall afflict your souls, in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">396</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 32. Thus it is clear that the prohibitions affecting the Day of Atonement commence on the evening before the actual day.</i> Similarly, <i>And ye shall make proclamation ‘b’etzem’ of this day a holy assembly</i><sup class="footnote-marker">397</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 21.</i> [stated with reference to the Festival of Weeks] includes the night as well. Now He did not mention this phrase <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> with reference to the Sabbath nor the festivals, except for the Festival of Weeks and the Day of Atonement, and so also in the prohibition of <i>chadash</i> (the new produce)<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">When the Sanctuary stood, the offering of the <i>omer</i> at any time on the sixteenth day of Nisan at once rendered <i>chadash</i> (the new crop) permissible food. Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188).</i> He said <i>until ‘etzem’ of this day</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 14.</i> The reason for this appears to be that since He had said of the Festival of Weeks, <i>from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving</i> … <i>ye shall number fifty days</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">398</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 15-16. Thus one might think that the observance of the festival depends on the doing of the acts prescribed for it, whereas the real meaning is: “from the <i>day</i> that you are to bring” etc. irrespective of whether they can be brought or not, as when the Temple is destroyed.</i> and then He stated, <i>and ye shall present a new meal-offering … Ye shall bring out of your dwellings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">399</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 16-17.</i> etc., and dealt at length with the commandments of the offerings [in Verses 17-20], therefore it was necessary to state, <i>And ye shall make proclamation ‘b’etzem’ of this day a solemn assembly;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">397</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 21.</i> meaning that the very day is holy and the doing of work is forbidden on it, and it is not dependent upon the sheaf [of the waving brought on the second day of Passover], nor on the offerings. Similarly in the case of the Day of Atonement, since He had said, <i>and ye shall afflict your souls, and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">400</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 27.</i> and in the section of <i>Acharei Moth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">401</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Chapter 16.</i> He made the [complete] expiation dependent upon the offerings and on the goat sent [to Azazel],<sup class="footnote-marker">402</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 22.</i> therefore it was necessary to state here, <i>And ye shall do no manner of work</i> on that very day, <i>for it is a day of atonement</i> in itself <i>to make atonement for you</i>, besides the expiation effected by the offerings. Similarly, <i>until ‘etzem’ of this day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 14.</i> said in connection with the new produce [means that the prohibition of eating from the new produce continues] up to that very day, which is the day <i>ye have brought the offering of your G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 14.</i> thus stating that even if the [meal-] offering [of the new barley] has not been brought, the commandment applies to that very day — so that the new produce<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">When the Sanctuary stood, the offering of the <i>omer</i> at any time on the sixteenth day of Nisan at once rendered <i>chadash</i> (the new crop) permissible food. Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188).</i> is forbidden before that day and is permissible afterwards. This is the sense of His saying, <i>it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 14.</i> as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">403</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 16.</i><br>We further find that Scripture mentions this phrase <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> in the case of events which have been decreed to come at certain set times. Thus it says of Noah, <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day entered Noah</i> etc.;<sup class="footnote-marker">393</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 7:13.</i> [and in case of the exodus it says,] <i>And it came to pass ‘b’etzem’ of this day that all the hosts of the Eternal went out from the land of Egypt;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">404</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:41.</i> [and when Moses was ordered to ascend Mount Nebo it says,] <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses ‘b’etzem’ of that day, saying: ‘Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto Mount Nebo.’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">405</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:48.</i> The reason for this expression in these [three] cases is that it is possible to think that Noah had brought into the ark beforehand many of the beasts and fowls [and on the selfsame day that <i>he finished</i> bringing them into the ark, he himself came in]; likewise it is possible [to think] that some Israelites had left Egypt before that time and on that day the exodus was completed, and so also that the command for Moses our teacher’s ascension was given before that day, and on that day he actually went up. Therefore Scripture explained in all these [three] cases that [the particular events referred to in the verses] all took place on these selfsame days, not that they were started before and finished on those days, but they all happened [completely] on these very days. Similarly, <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day was Abraham circumcised</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">406</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 17:26.</i> means that many people were circumcised in one day, the verse thus stating Abraham’s zeal in observing the commandments.<br>It further appears to me that the expression “the <i>etzem</i>” of any thing means “its power and strength,” the term being derived from the verses: <i>my power ‘v’otzem’</i> (<i>and the might</i>) <i>of my hand;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">407</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 8:17.</i> <i>strength ‘v’tha’atzumoth’</i> (<i>and power</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">408</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 68:36.</i> So also, <i>One dieth ‘b’etzem tumo’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">409</sup><i class="footnote">Job 21:23.</i> means “in <i>the</i> fulness of <i>his</i> strength.” And since the bones form the structure of the body and its strength, they are so called [<i>atzamoth —</i> from the word <i>otzem</i>, strength]. Thus <i>‘k’etzem’ the heaven for clearness</i><sup class="footnote-marker">391</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:10.</i> means that the purity of that which they saw [at Mount Sinai] was clear and strong, even as is a pure clear heaven. It is for this reason that He mentions about those specific days [of festivals referred to above] the expression <i>etzem hayom</i>, in order to indicate that these matters specified are of the very essence of the days, not because of other things added to them, namely the offerings brought on those days.<br>And so also did Onkelos translate [the word <i>etzem</i> as] “<i>bikran</i> of that day,” which [literally] means “‘in the horn’ of that day,” [i.e.,] in its essence and in its strength, the word <i>bikran</i> being related to these expressions: <i>and all ‘karnei’</i> (<i>the horns</i>) <i>of the wicked will I cut off;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">410</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 75:11.</i> <i>my shield ‘v’keren’</i> (<i>and the horn of</i>) <i>my salvation;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">411</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 22:3.</i> for since the strength [of the animal] is in its horns, therefore the substance of a thing is called <i>karno</i> [“its horn” — its strength or essence]. In the language of the Sages we find:<sup class="footnote-marker">412</sup><i class="footnote">Terumoth 7:1.</i> “He pays the <i>keren</i> (the principal value) but he does not pay the [added] fifth.” And some texts of Onkelos have <i>bichran</i> [with a <i>chaph</i> instead of <i>bikran</i> with a <i>kuph</i>], but it is all one, for in Scripture <i>kova</i> and <i>chova</i> both mean hat,<sup class="footnote-marker">413</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 17:38 (<i>kova</i>); 17:5 (<i>chova</i>). See Vol. I, p. 506, where Ramban mentions this princuple briefly, that the <i>kuph</i> and the <i>kaph</i> (or <i>chaph</i>) are often interchangeable.</i> and the Sages always make use of the term <i>akava</i> written with a <i>kaph</i> [meaning “staying”], which is derived from the expression, <i>‘v’lo y’akveim’</i> [written with a <i>kuph</i>, and meaning: <i>and He stayeth them not</i>] <i>when His voice is heard</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">414</sup><i class="footnote">Job 37:4.</i> The Rabbis also say <i>mithkasheit</i> [with a <i>kuph</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">415</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta, Kethuboth 7:3. See my Hebrew commentary p. 156, Note 73.</i> from the word <i>tachshitin</i> [with a <i>chaph</i>, meaning “ornaments”]. They further say: “If ants <i>kors’muha</i>” [with a <i>kuph</i>, meaning “nibbled” the crop],<sup class="footnote-marker">416</sup><i class="footnote">Peah 2:7.</i> of the root: <i>the boar out of the wood ‘y’chars’menah’</i> [with a <i>chaph</i>, meaning: <i>doth ravage it</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">417</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 80:14.</i> And those other places where the expression <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> is mentioned also mean: “in the strength of that day,” for they were matters which in the normal course of events could not happen in one day. Therefore Scripture stated that all the beasts and all the cattle and all the fowl and all creeping things upon the earth were gathered by “the power” of that day, by the decree of G-d upon them, for <i>it was</i> His <i>mouth that commanded and the breath thereof it hath gathered them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">418</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 34:16.</i> Similarly, <i>six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children</i><sup class="footnote-marker">419</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:37.</i> cannot be gathered together and go out as one man from the land of Egypt [all in one day], only by the strength of the day which was so decreed upon it by word of the Supreme One. And so also in the case of Moses our teacher, this expression [<i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i>] is intended to teach that on the day he was commanded to write this song, <i>and teach it the children of Israel, put it in their mouths</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">420</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 31:19.</i> <i>and he finished speaking all these words</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">421</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 32:45.</i> it was decreed upon him that he go up by the power of that day in which the Divine decree was given, to Mount Abarim, and then he said the section of <i>‘V’zoth Habrachah’</i> (<i>And this is the blessing</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">422</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 33.</i> and afterwards he went up to the mountain — all these activities being matters which would usually take many days, but they were all done by the power and strength of the day. Similarly, that three hundred and twenty men<sup class="footnote-marker">423</sup><i class="footnote">Three hundred and eighteen were the trained men in the house of Abraham (Genesis 14:14). Together with Abraham and Ishmael there are three hundred and twenty.</i> should be circumcised in one day in the house of Abraham was a thing that proceeded from G-d. Now the prophet Ezekiel said, <i>they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, to ‘etzem’ this day</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">424</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 2:3.</i> in order to include that very day in this group. So also the expression <i>until ‘etzem’ of this day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 14.</i> of the prohibition of the new produce, means “until and inclusive of this day” [i.e., on the sixteenth of Nisan it is also forbidden to eat of the new produce, before the bringing of the meal-offering of the new barley], for the essence of a thing is its power and strength.<br>And our Rabbis have interpreted the expression <i>‘b’etzem’ of this day</i> used in connection with the festivals, to mean<sup class="footnote-marker">425</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 14:7.</i> “on the day itself,” that is to say, from the time the stars appear until they come out on the following night, thus excluding the additional time which the Sages have deduced must be added from profane unto holy [i.e., before the actual beginning of the festival, and after its actual end]. And in the cases of Noah, and the exodus from Egypt, and Moses’ [death], they interpreted that phrase to mean “in the strength of the day,” [that is] mid-day, as is stated in the Sifre,<sup class="footnote-marker">394</sup><i class="footnote">Sifre, <i>Ha’azinu</i> 332.</i> and Rashi wrote it in the section of <i>Ha’azinu</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">405</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:48.</i>

IT IS ‘ATZERETH.’<sup class="footnote-marker">426</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>atzereth</i> is of the root <i>atzor</i> (to hold back, restrain). Rashi will accordingly explain that the eighth day of Tabernacles is the day G-d requested Israel “to hold back” yet another day before leaving for their homes. Ramban will explain <i>atzereth</i> in the sense of “binding,” or “holding in,” because this day represents the assembly of all emanations alluded to by all festivals, as mentioned in the text.</i> “I keep you back before Me. It is similar to the case of a prince who invited his children to a banquet for a certain number of days. When the time came for them to leave, he said, ‘I beg of you stay with me for yet one more day, for your departure is so hard for me!’” This is Rashi’s language.

See also Vol. I, p. 28: “In the profounder sense etc.”</i> this being the eighth day. <i>It is ‘Atzereth</i>,’ for there everything is assembled. Now with respect to the Festival of Unleavened Bread He commanded that it be observed for seven days, with the first and seventh [days] being holy, though <i>they are all holy and the Eternal is among them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">430</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 16:3.</i> From then on [i.e., beginning with the second day of Passover] we are to count forty-nine days[of the <i>omer</i>], which are seven weeks comparable to the [seven] “days” of the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">431</sup><i class="footnote">The thought suggested is that the seven “weeks” of the <i>omer</i> are comparable to “the days” of the world, and <i>Shevuoth</i> is thus like the “eighth day” in the Festival of Tabernacles; and the forty-nine days between the first day and “the eighth day” are thus like the intermediate days of the Festival of Tabernacles (Abusaula).</i> and then to sanctify the “eighth day” [i.e., the Festival of Weeks] just as the eighth day of Tabernacles [is holy]; and [the forty-nine days] counted between them are in the “intermediate days” of the festival, in the interval separating the first day and “eighth day” of the festival, this being the day of the Giving of the Torah when He made them <i>to see His great fire</i> and His words they heard <i>out of the midst of the fire</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">432</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:36.</i> Therefore our Rabbis, of blessed memory, always called the Festival of Weeks by the name of <i>Atzereth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">433</sup><i class="footnote">As in Chagigah 17 a.</i> [a name here used in the verse for the eighth day of the Festival of Tabernacles], for it is on “the eighth” day of the festival, which Scripture here so called by that name. And this is the [intention of the] saying of the Rabbis:<sup class="footnote-marker">434</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 4 b.</i> “The eighth day is a festival for itself” with respect to <i>‘p’zar k’shab,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">435</sup><i class="footnote">This is an acrostic for the following Hebrew words: <i>pa’yis</i> (lots), <i>z’man</i> (time), <i>regel</i> (festival), <i>korban</i> (offering), <i>shir</i> (song), <i>brachah</i> (blessing). These are all references to various laws indicating that the eighth day of Tabernacles is not considered as just another day of that festival, but is rather an independent festival by itself.

In that respect the eighth day <i>is</i> connected with the first seven days.</i> since it is an emanation of the first days but is not like their unity. Therefore in the section of <i>All the firstlings</i><sup class="footnote-marker">437</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 15:19.</i> He mentions in speaking of the three festivals — the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Tabernacles — [that the Festival of Tabernacles] is seven days<sup class="footnote-marker">438</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:15.</i> and He did not mention the eighth day, for there He said, <i>all thy males appear</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">439</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.

Verse 39

WHEN YE HAVE GATHERED IN THE INCREASE OF THE LAND. “[This is to state] that this seventh month [in which the Festival of Tabernacles occurs] must be at the time of the harvest. From here we learn that they were commanded to intercalate the years [with an extra month], because if there would be no such intercalation, the seventh month [i.e., Tishri] would sometimes fall in the middle of the summer, or in the winter.” This is Rashi’s language. And the words of the Torath Kohanim are as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">440</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 15:6-7.</i> “Intercalate the years so that you make the Festival of Tabernacles at the time of the ingathering of the fruits. I might think that this refers to the ingathering of all the fruits; Scripture therefore says, <i>Thou shalt keep the feast of Tabernacles … after thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy wine-press</i><sup class="footnote-marker">441</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:13.</i> — <i>‘from’ thy threshing-floor</i> but not all thy threshing-floor, <i>and ‘from’ thy wine-press</i>, but not all thy wine-press. Now if I am to follow the expression <i>after thou hast gathered in ‘from’ thy threshing-floor</i>, I might think that even if only a little [of it has been gathered in, the Festival of Tabernacles may already be observed in that part of the year, and there is no need then for intercalating an extra month at the end of the preceding winter]; Scripture therefore says [here], <i>when ye have gathered in the produce of the land</i>. How can these be reconciled? [In the following manner]: Try to intercalate the year so that the Festival of Tabernacles occurs when most of the fruits have already been gathered in.” Now the Sages have already derived [the need for] intercalating the year from the verse <i>Observe the month of ‘aviv’</i> (<i>spring</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">442</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 16:1. This teaches that before it comes you are to watch whether that month will be capable of producing <i>aviv</i> (ripe ears), and if not, intercalate a year [by adding a month to the winter period] (Rashi <i>ibid.</i>, on the basis of Sanhedrin 11 a).</i> But there Scripture taught about [the intercalation of the year because of] the spring [i.e., so that the celebration of the exodus occurs in the month when there are ripe ears already, so that the sheaf of waving can be brought on the sixteenth of Nisan from the new barley], and here it teaches concerning the fruits of the trees [that most of them must be ripened at the time of the Festival of Weeks, so that they are ready to be brought as first-fruits to the Sanctuary, and that most of them are to be gathered in before the Festival of Tabernacles]. For so did the Sages teach us:<sup class="footnote-marker">443</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 11 b.</i> “The year is intercalated on account of three things: on account of ripe ears [that they be available at the time of Passover], fruits of the trees [at the time of the Festival of Weeks], and on account of the solstice [that the summer solstice should not occur after the passing of Tabernacles].<sup class="footnote-marker">444</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi, <i>ibid.</i></i> Thus the need for intercalation is deduced automatically [from the statement] that this festival [of Tabernacles] is at the time of the ingathering [and if an extra month is not added at the end of the winter season, the festival might sometimes occur in the middle of the summer or winter].<br>The meaning, however, of the Scriptural verse here is as follows: It states, <i>These are the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i> all of <i>which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring</i> on all of them <i>an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">445</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 37.</i> However, <i>on the fifteenth day of this seventh month</i>, because it is the time when you have gathered in the increase of the land, <i>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal seven days</i>. He said here in addition, <i>on the first day shall be ‘shabbathon’ and on the eighth day shall be ‘shabbathon,’</i> meaning that you are to desist from work, and to rest on them, as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">446</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 24.</i> And He further said that they should rejoice even more before G-d with the <i>lulav</i> and <i>ethrog</i><sup class="footnote-marker">447</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 40.</i> for seven days, for it is a time of rejoicing because G-d has blessed you <i>in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful</i><sup class="footnote-marker">448</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:15.</i> before Him. The meaning of the phrase [in the verse before us] <i>ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal</i>, is that you are to celebrate it before Him by giving thanks to His Name for your gathering of the harvest which came [in time]. Then He went back and stated again [further on in Verse 41], <i>And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Eternal</i>, in order to place next to it [the commandment], <i>Ye shall dwell in booths</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">449</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 42.</i> the meaning thereof being as follows: <i>and ye shall keep it a feast seven days</i> in the year by dwelling in booths, <i>and all that are home-born shall dwell</i> in them, thus stating that they shall make a festival of seven days by taking the <i>lulav</i>, and rejoicing before G-d, and dwelling in booths. And the interpretation thereof in the Torath Kohanim is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">450</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 17:1.</i> “<i>And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">451</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 41.</i> Why is this stated? Since it is said, <i>Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto the Eternal thy G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">448</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:15.</i> I might think that the Festival-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">380</sup><i class="footnote">This is the Festival peace-offering which one is obliged to bring when making the pilgrimage to the Sanctuary three times in the year (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 60-61).</i> must be brought on all seven days; Scripture therefore says here <i>‘it’”</i> [<i>And ye shall keep ‘it’ a feast</i>, thus stating that this offering need only be brought once], etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">452</sup><i class="footnote">“And why does Scripture (in Deuteronomy 16:15) state <i>seven?</i> It is with reference to the supplementary period — that if he has not brought the Festival-offering on one day, he may bring it on another of the seven days” (Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 17:2); and on the Festival of Tabernacles, he may bring it even on the eighth day (<i>ibid.</i>, 3). See above, Note 436.</i>

Verse 40

AND YE SHALL TAKE YOU ON THE FIRST DAY ‘PRI EITZ HADAR’ (THE FRUIT OF GOODLY TREES). “[That is, a tree] whose bark has the same taste as its fruit. <i>Hadar</i> [a fruit] that ‘remains’ on its tree from one year to another, and this is the <i>ethrog</i>.” This is Rashi’s language. But these interpretations are merely Scriptural supports which our Rabbis taught<sup class="footnote-marker">453</sup><i class="footnote">Succah 35 a.</i> as a basis for their tradition [that the reference here is to the <i>ethrog</i>]. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: “And they [i.e., the masters of tradition] have said the truth [that <i>pri eitz hadar</i> refers to the <i>ethrog</i>], for there is no fruit of the tree more beautiful (<i>hadar</i>) than the <i>ethrog</i>. The Rabbis’ interpreted that <i>hadar</i> means [the fruit] that ‘remains’ on its tree [from one year to another], but this is merely a Scriptural support for a matter of tradition.”<br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the tree which is called in the Aramaic language <i>ethrog</i>, is called in the Sacred Tongue <i>hadar</i>, for the meaning of the word <i>ethrog</i> is “desirable,” as [Onkelos] rendered: <i>‘nechmad’</i> (<i>pleasant</i>) <i>to the sight</i><sup class="footnote-marker">454</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:9.</i> —” <i>dimrageig</i> to see; “<i>‘lo thachmod’</i> (<i>Thou shalt not covet</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">455</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:14.</i> — “thou shalt not <i>theirog</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">456</sup><i class="footnote">In our version of Onkelos <i>lo theirog</i> is given as the translation of the Hebrew <i>‘lo thithaveh’</i> (<i>Thou shalt not desire</i>) — in Deuteronomy 5:18. In Exodus 20:14, the Aramaic is the same as the Hebrew: <i>lo thachameid</i>. — The general point, however, is clearly established, that the term <i>theirog</i> means “desire,” “delight” or “pleasant.” The name <i>ethrog</i> is related to this expression.</i> And we also say:<sup class="footnote-marker">457</sup><i class="footnote">The source of the expression is found in Targum Jonathan to Psalms 45:14. From Ramban’s words “we say,” it would seem that he is referring to that phrase written in the marriage contract wherein the husband undertakes to pay to his wife a certain sum of money “from all the best, most desirable of his belongings.”</i> “from all the best, <i>arag</i> (most desirable) properties.” And the terms <i>hadar</i> and <i>chemdah</i> are alike in meaning [“desirable”]. Thus the tree and the fruit [<i>ethrog</i>] are both called by one name [as <i>hadar</i> in Aramaic is <i>ethrog</i>], for such is the customary usage of names for most fruits: <i>t’einah</i> [denotes both the fig tree and the fruit]; <i>egoz</i> (nut); <i>rimon</i> (pomegranate); <i>zayith</i> (olive) and other fruits [in all of which cases both the tree and its fruit have the same name], and similarly this tree and fruit are both called in Aramaic <i>ethrog</i>, and in the Sacred Tongue they are called <i>hadar</i>.<br>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse is stating that we should take for ourselves a <i>pri eitz hadar</i> [“the fruit of a tree called <i>hadar</i>” in Hebrew, which is called <i>ethrog</i> in Aramaic], and that we take <i>branches of palm-trees</i>, and one <i>bough of thick trees</i> [known as <i>hadas</i>, the myrtle], and one bough of <i>the willows of the brook</i> [known as <i>aravah</i>]. Thus [we are to take] one of each of the [four] species, for the [plural] expression <i>branches of palm-trees</i> is connected with <i>And ye shall take you</i>, which refers to many people [so that each person is to take only one of these branches],<sup class="footnote-marker">458</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, since the Rabbis have interpreted the phrase <i>and ye shall take you</i> as meaning that the taking of the four species is to be done by each person, therefore Onkelos translated it: “and you [all] shall take <i>ethrogin, lulavin</i> etc. [in the plural] since the Torah is speaking here to all individuals together. Hence even though it is written <i>branches of palm-trees</i> in the plural, yet we only have to take one branch of a palm-tree, the plural being used because the phrase is connected with <i>and ye shall take you</i>, which refers to many people.</i> since the final decision of the law is like Rabbi Akiba<sup class="footnote-marker">459</sup><i class="footnote">Succah 34 b. See, however, at the very end of this discussion for the practice today.</i> who says: “Just as only one palm-branch is needed and only one <i>ethrog</i>, so also [we need only] one myrtle-branch and one willow-branch.” Therefore Onkelos translated all these four species in the plural [<i>ethrogin, lulavin</i>, etc.], since they are all connected with the [preceding] phrase <i>And ye shall take you</i>, which refers to many people.<sup class="footnote-marker">458</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, since the Rabbis have interpreted the phrase <i>and ye shall take you</i> as meaning that the taking of the four species is to be done by each person, therefore Onkelos translated it: “and you [all] shall take <i>ethrogin, lulavin</i> etc. [in the plural] since the Torah is speaking here to all individuals together. Hence even though it is written <i>branches of palm-trees</i> in the plural, yet we only have to take one branch of a palm-tree, the plural being used because the phrase is connected with <i>and ye shall take you</i>, which refers to many people.</i> And in [explanation of] the reason for this commandment, by way of homiletic discourse, the Rabbis have said that these [four] species are used to obtain the favor of G-d that He may give water.<sup class="footnote-marker">460</sup><i class="footnote">Taanith 2 b.</i><br>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <i>‘pri eitz hadar’</i> (<i>the fruit of the goodly tree</i>) is the fruit in which there is a great deal of desire, and the first man sinned with it, as it is said, <i>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">461</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 3:6.</i> Thus the sin consisted [of taking the <i>ethrog</i>] alone,<sup class="footnote-marker">462</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beiur Ha ‘lvush</i> in his commentary to Ricanti who quotes the language of Ramban.</i> and we obtain His favor [by means of the <i>ethrog</i>] together with the other species …<sup class="footnote-marker">463</sup><i class="footnote">To couple the tent together, that it may be one (Abusaula).</i> From here you will understand and know that the <i>ethrog</i> is not bound up with the other three species, and yet it invalidates [the performance of the commandment] if it is not taken together with them, for it is comparable to <i>Atzereth</i> (the eighth day of Tabernacles)<sup class="footnote-marker">464</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 36.</i> which is a festival of its own, and yet is supplementary to the first days.<sup class="footnote-marker">436</sup><i class="footnote">Thus: “He that made no offerings on the first festival day of Tabernacles, must offer them any day throughout the whole festival, even on the last [i.e., the eighth] day of Tabernacles” (Chagigah 9 a).

I have already explained the reason for this.<sup class="footnote-marker">464</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 36.</i> Thus the meaning of the whole section is as follows: “Ye shall keep the feast of the Great Name for the <i>seven days</i> of creation,<sup class="footnote-marker">465</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. I, p. 28: “In the profounder sense etc.”</i> and join on to them the eighth day, <i>Atzereth</i>, similar to what is said, <i>For the leader with strong-music on the ‘sheminith’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">466</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 6:1.</i> [literally: ‘the eighth’]. And also on those seven days ye shall take <i>the fruit of the tree</i> called <i>‘hadar’</i> [i.e., the <i>ethrog</i>] together with the palm-branch in union [with the myrtle-branch and the willow].<sup class="footnote-marker">467</sup><i class="footnote">But the <i>ethrog</i> is not in the union (Abusaula).</i> That is why He mentioned first the <i>ethrog</i> [for it is not tied together with the palm-branch, which is in union with the other two species, since the <i>ethrog</i> alludes to the eighth day of the festival which is a feast of its own], but on the eighth day it is not necessary [to take these four species], for it is itself <i>hadar</i>.” And this is the explanation of the verse, <i>‘v’chagothem’</i> (<i>and ye shall keep it a feast</i>) <i>unto the Eternal seven days ‘in the year,’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">451</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 41.</i> meaning that you are to keep it seven days “with the year,” that is with the surrounding and circular movement [around the altar in procession with the four species], related to the expressions: <i>‘v’chug</i> (<i>and the circuit</i>) <i>of heaven;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">468</sup><i class="footnote">Job 22:14.</i> <i>and he marketh it out ‘bam’chugah’</i> (<i>with the compass</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">469</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 44:13.</i> and so also: <i>a multitude ‘chogeig’</i> (<i>keeping holyday</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">470</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 42:5.</i><br>Our Rabbis have already alluded to this secret.

And what is the <i>lulav</i>? It is symbolic of the spinal cord. <i>And boughs of thick trees</i>, meaning a tree the branches of which cover its larger portion.

This in its simplest sense is the meaning of the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah: “Thus <i>the bough</i> is to the left etc.”</i> And why is it called <i>eitz</i> (tree)? Because it is the root of the tree. And what are <i>‘arvei nachal’</i> (<i>willows of the brook</i>)?

Verse 41



Verse 42

ALL ‘HA’EZRACH’ (THAT ARE NATIVE) IN ISRAEL SHALL DWELL IN BOOTHS. “<i>Ezrach</i> means native-born. <i>Ha’ezrach</i> [literally: ‘the’ native-born], this is to exclude women [from the obligation of dwelling in the booth, since the definite article denotes an exclusion. It was necessary that this exclusion be stated] so that you should not deduce from a similarity of expressions of <i>the fifteenth day</i> stated with reference to the Festival of Unleavened Bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">486</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 6.</i> that women are obliged to dwell in a booth just as they are obliged to eat unleavened bread [on the night of Passover]. <i>In Israel</i>, this includes proselytes” [that they are obliged to dwell in a booth]. This is Rashi’s language. And in the Torath Kohanim it is stated:<sup class="footnote-marker">487</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 17:9.</i> <i>“Ezrach</i>, this is the native-born. <i>Ha’ezrach</i>, this is intended to exclude women. <i>‘All’ that are home-born</i>, this is to include the proselytes and liberated slaves.” And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, by way of tradition [there is no need for a special source in Scripture here to include proselytes]. For since Scripture has stated, <i>ye shall have one law</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">488</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:29.</i> <i>both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the Land</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">489</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:14.</i> and it is further said, <i>as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">490</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 15:15.</i> there is no need to mention again in every place: “all that are native-born and the stranger.” Therefore He says <i>all that are native in Israel</i>, meaning all who are of Israel, <i>from the greatest of them even to the least of them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">491</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah 3:5.</i> [to teach] that it is not sufficient that one of a household should dwell in a booth and the rest dwell in homes, but they should all dwell in booths. It is possible that the verse [uses the word <i>ezrach</i>] to teach that all who are <i>like a leafy tree in its native soil</i><sup class="footnote-marker">492</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 37:35.</i> in their homes [are obliged to dwell in booths], except for those who are on a sea voyage, and those who travel on the road [who are exempt from dwelling in a booth].

Verse 43

THAT I MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO ABIDE IN BOOTHS. “This means the clouds of Glory” [which surrounded the camp of the Israelites during their stay in the wilderness]. This is Rashi’s language. And in my opinion this is the correct interpretation [even] according to the literal sense of Scripture, for He commanded that the generations should know all the great deeds of the Eternal which He did wondrously with them, that He made them dwell in the clouds of His Glory like in a booth, similar to what is said, <i>And the Eternal will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy</i>. <i>And there shall be a ‘succah’</i> (<i>pavilion</i>) <i>for a shadow in the day-time from the heat</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">493</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 4:5-6.</i> And since Scripture has already explained that <i>the cloud of the Eternal was upon</i> them <i>by day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">494</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 40:38.</i> <i>and the pillar of fire by night</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">495</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 13:22.</i> He just says here, <i>that I made the children of Israel to abide in booths</i>, [without explaining what kind of booths, but meaning] “I made them booths out of the clouds of My Glory to protect them.” Thus He commanded that at the beginning of the summer season we are to remember the exodus from Egypt by [calling] its month [the first of the months],<sup class="footnote-marker">496</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban in Exodus 12:2 (Vol. II, pp. 16-7).</i> and by observing its festival [of Passover], and He further commanded the remembrance of the continuous miracle which was done for them throughout the days of their stay in the wilderness, at the beginning of the winter season. And according to the opinion of the Sage who says<sup class="footnote-marker">497</sup><i class="footnote">This is Rabbi Akiba (Succah 11 b).That the <i>succoth</i> were “clouds of Glory” [mentioned above] is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> that they made themselves booths in the literal sense, [we must explain that the reason why this commandment is to be observed at the onset of the winter season], is because they began to make them at the beginning of the winter, on account of the cold, as is customary in camps, and therefore He commanded [that we also make] them at that time. The sense of the remembrance is that they should know and remember that they were in the wilderness, and did not live in homes, <i>and they found no city of habitation</i><sup class="footnote-marker">498</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 107:4.</i> for forty years, but G-d was with them and they lacked nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">499</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 2:7.</i>

Verse 44

AND MOSES DECLARED UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THE APPOINTED SEASONS OF THE ETERNAL. The meaning thereof is as follows: The above sections contain admonitions directed to Aaron and his sons, and Moses therefore told them to Aaron and his sons, and sometimes He mentions after them also the children of Israel, as He said at the end of the section dealing with blemishes, <i>So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">500</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 21:24.</i> for although Moses was only commanded, <i>Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever be of thy seed</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">501</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 17.</i> he wanted to exhort the court of Israel about this matter [and therefore he also spoke <i>to all the children of Israel</i>]. Perhaps the reason [why he exhorted the court] is because a person covers up his blemishes, and the priest does not want to be disqualified on account of them from performing the Divine Service, for it is a [source of] shame and disgrace, therefore He exhorted the court about this matter. But here Scripture states that he declared the appointed seasons of the Eternal to all the children of Israel as one man, and it did not single out the sons of Aaron in these commandments, the reason being that the admonition applies to all alike, since the main [commandments] of these sections are that we are to rest on the Sabbaths and festivals, and to proclaim them holy convocations. None of the offerings are mentioned in these sections, except for the offering of the sheaf [on the second day of Passover], and the two loaves [on the Festival of Weeks], as they [these festivals] are the causes for their being offered. And in the section where the main offerings of the Day of Atonement are set forth,<sup class="footnote-marker">502</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapter 16.</i> it says, <i>Speak unto Aaron thy brother</i><sup class="footnote-marker">503</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>. Verse 2.</i> [because it was Aaron’s duty to perform the Service on that day].<br>And our Rabbis have interpreted [the verse before us] as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">504</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 17:12.</i> “<i>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Eternal</i>. This teaches that Moses told Israel the laws of Passover on the Passover, and the laws of <i>Atzereth</i> [the Festival of Weeks]<sup class="footnote-marker">505</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above on Verse 36.</i> on <i>Atzereth</i>, and the laws of the Festival of Tabernacles on Tabernacles. In the very language that he heard it, in that language he told them all the sections.” Onkelos also intended to imply this point, for he rendered the verse as follows: “And Moses declared the order<sup class="footnote-marker">506</sup><i class="footnote">By adding this expression “the order of” [the festivals] to the Hebrew words, Onkelos hinted that Moses conveyed the laws of the festivals to the people in order of their times, “the laws of Passover on the Passover, etc.” Onkelos’ intent in adding the phrase “and he taught them” will be explained further on by Ramban.</i> of the appointed seasons of the Eternal, and taught them to the children of Israel.” It appears [from Onkelos’ additional phrase “the order of “] that his opinion is to allude [to the fact] that Moses taught the children of Israel the order of the festivals by means of the intercalation [of the years with an extra month], which was handed over to him by word of mouth on Sinai, this being alluded to in the Scriptural text, <i>which ye shall proclaim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">507</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 4.</i> holy convocations, and Moses taught the children of Israel by word of mouth the whole traditional order of the secret of intercalation.

And the section of <i>V’atah Tetzaveh</i> (<i>And thou shalt command</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">508</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 27:20.</i> [where the same subject is mentioned], is stated only for the sake of giving an orderly account of the work of the Tabernacle, explaining what the purpose of the candelabrum is, and the sense of the verse there is as follows: ‘<i>and thou wilt</i> at some future time <i>command the children of Israel</i> on this matter.’” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But it does not appear to me to be correct, for that section [there in Exodus 27:20] is not in fact adjoined to the section of the candelabrum [which is mentioned previously in Exodus 25:31-40]; and [also] it has already been stated, <i>And he lighted the lamps before the Eternal, as the Eternal commanded Moses</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">509</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 40:25.</i> thus both the commandment and fulfillment were already mentioned and kept! Rather, the need for [restatement of] this section is for two purposes. For there He commanded that <i>they bring you</i> a donation <i>on the behalf of the children of Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">510</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 27:21.</i> that is to say, from every man with whom was found <i>pure olive oil</i> [<i>beaten</i>] <i>for the light</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">508</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 27:20.</i> together with the other donations for the Tabernacle. And so they did, as it is said, <i>And the princes brought</i> etc. <i>and the spice, and the oil, for the light</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">511</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 35:27-28.</i> And although it says there, <i>it shall be a statute forever throughout their generations</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">510</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 27:21.</i> this refers to the lighting of the lamps. But now the oil which the princes brought as a donation was used up, and therefore He commanded that the children of Israel take from the public treasury throughout the generations<sup class="footnote-marker">512</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3 here.</i> <i>pure olive oil beaten for the light</i>, as was the first oil [of the princes]. This is similar to the expression, <i>that they bring thee a Red Heifer</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">513</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 19:2.</i> meaning that they should seek it and it is to be brought from the public treasury. Also, there [in the section of <i>V’atah Tetzaveh</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">508</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 27:20.</i> He stated only, <i>Aaron and his sons shall set it in order</i> etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">510</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 27:21.</i> which might mean [set it in order] on the candelabrum, or without the candelabrum if it is broken or lost, as happened when they returned from the [Babylonian] exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">514</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar Rabbah 15:7: “Therefore when the [First] Sanctuary was destroyed the candelabrum was hidden. And this was one of the five things that were hidden: the ark, the candelabrum, etc.”</i> Therefore now He stated clearly, <i>He shall order the lamps upon the pure candelabrum</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">515</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> teaching that they should only light the lamps upon the pure candelabrum. And the interpretation of our Rabbis is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">516</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 13:12.</i> “<i>Upon the pure candelabrum</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">515</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> This means upon the very candelabrum itself, that he is not to support them [i.e., the lamps] with pieces of wood or pebbles [but the lamps are to be upon the candelabrum itself, with nothing intervening between them]. <i>He shall set the lamps before the Eternal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">515</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> This teaches that he is not to set them outside the Sanctuary and bring them inside. <i>Continually</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">515</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> even on the Sabbath; <i>continually</i>, even in impurity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">517</sup><i class="footnote">If all the priests have been rendered impure, they may yet proceed to minister the Service.</i>

V’HAYTHAH’ (AND IT SHALL BE) FOR AARON AND HIS SONS — “[The feminine word <i>‘v’haythah’</i> refers to] the meal-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">518</sup><i class="footnote">The point of Rashi’s comment is that since the word <i>v’haythah</i> (and it shall be) is in the feminine, and in the preceding verse [7] <i>lechem</i> (bread) is mentioned, which is in the masculine, the word <i>minchah</i> (meal-offering) which is in the feminine must then be added to <i>v’haythah</i>. Ramban will suggest this is not necessary, as will be explained in the text.</i> for anything which is offered of grain is included within the term <i>minchah</i> (meal-offering). [The masculine suffix in] <i>‘va’achaluhu’</i> (<i>and they shall eat it</i>), refers to the <i>lechem</i>” [“bread” mentioned in Verse 7, which is a masculine noun]. This is Rashi’s language. It is possible that the verb <i>v’haythah</i> [“and it shall be” — in the feminine] refers to each of the two <i>ma’arachoth</i> [“rows” of six loaves mentioned in Verse 6, since <i>ma’arachah</i> is in the feminine, and hence <i>v’haythah</i> is also in the feminine]. And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabalah], <i>‘v’haythah’</i> (<i>and it shall be</i>) <i>for Aaron and his sons</i> refers back to <i>brith olam</i> [“an everlasting covenant” at the end of the preceding Verse 8, since the word <i>brith</i> is in the feminine], similar to what is said, <i>‘Brithi haythah’</i> (<i>My covenant was</i>) <i>with him of life and peace</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">519</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 2:5.</i>

Verse 10

AND THE SON OF AN ISRAELITE WOMAN, WHOSE FATHER WAS AN EGYPTIAN, WENT OUT, etc. This means that he went out <i>among the children of Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">520</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew, the word <i>vayeitzei</i> (and he went out) is not adjoined to the phrase, <i>among the children of Israel</i>. Ramban thus calls attention to the fact that they are to be understood together: “and there went out among the children of Israel,” or “into the midst of the children of Israel, the son of an Israeli woman” etc.</i> similar to the expression: <i>and he went out into the midst of the city</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">521</sup><i class="footnote">Esther 4:1.</i> meaning that he [Mordecai] went out from his house or from where he was abiding into the city. Similarly, this [son of an Israelite woman] went out from his tent or from his place, and came into the midst of the people, and they strove there. The meaning of the word <i>bamachaneh</i> [“in the camp” — <i>and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together ‘in the camp’</i>], is that the quarrel took place in the camp and many people heard it, and [when they heard the son of the Israelite woman blaspheming the Name], they took hold of him <i>and they brought him unto Moses</i><sup class="footnote-marker">522</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> into [his] tent. And the reason why Scripture mentions this episode here, is as the words of the Sage<sup class="footnote-marker">523</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Berachyah (Tanchuma, <i>Emor</i> 23) and mentioned in Rashi.</i> who says: “He ‘came forth’ from the section above [i.e., he began his argument by speaking contemptuously of a law mentioned in the above section], for he sinned with his lips concerning <i>the fire-offerings of the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">524</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 9. In that section the law is stated concerning the showbread; that it was to be set on the table in the Sanctuary every Sabbath, and the following Sabbath it was to be removed, and after the frankincense was burnt as a memorial for the showbread, the bread was to be eaten by the priests. When this law was announced, the son of the Israelite woman said: “It behoves a king to eat fresh bread daily, and not stale bread!”</i> and an Israelite man rebuked him, whereupon they strove and he became angered and then blasphemed “himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">525</sup><i class="footnote">This is a euphemism, the real intent of which is the Ineffable Name.</i><br>The intention of the expression <i>the son of an Israelite woman and a man of Israel</i>, is to teach that if a non-Jew has sexual relations with a Jewish woman, the child is not deemed Jewish. And although we have rendered the final decision in the Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">526</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 45 a.</i> that if a non-Jew has sexual relations with a Jewish woman whether she is single or married, the child is a fully-qualified Jew, yet they have said,<sup class="footnote-marker">527</sup><i class="footnote">Bechoroth 47 a.</i> “the child is ‘rejected,’” meaning that it is disqualified for the priesthood;<sup class="footnote-marker">528</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, if the child was a girl she may not be married to a priest (Yebamoth 45 a).</i> and certainly it is not considered a fully-qualified Israelite by name as far as genealogy is concerned, with respect to the standards [i.e., as to where he was to take his place under one of the four main standards that were set up],<sup class="footnote-marker">529</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers Chapter 2.</i> and inheriting of the Land, for it is written of them, <i>according to the names of the tribes of their fathers</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">530</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:55 (with respect to inheritance). With regard to the standards it is also written, <i>The children of Israel shall pitch by their fathers’ houses</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 2:2).</i> And that which the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">531</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 14:1.</i> “<i>Among the children of Israel</i>, this teaches that he had become a proselyte,” does not mean that he needed conversion, for he was like all Israelites who entered into the covenant by circumcision, immersion, and the expiation by blood, at the time of the Giving of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">532</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:6. See in Vol. II, p. 260, Note 79 for full discussion of this matter.</i> But the intention of the Rabbis [in this text of the Torath Kohanim] was to state that he was reared by his mother and became attached to Israel, this being the meaning of the expression <i>among the children of Israel</i>, that he was with them and he did not want to go after his father to be an Egyptian. Similarly, that which the Rabbis have said in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">531</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Emor</i> 14:1.</i> “Although there were no <i>mamzerim</i> at that time, he was like one,” this text follows the opinion of a single Sage [who says that if a non-Jew has sexual relations with a Jewish woman, the child is deemed a <i>mamzer</i>], but the final decision of the law is that the child is a fully-qualified Jew.<br>And the French Rabbis<sup class="footnote-marker">533</sup><i class="footnote">I found this opinion in the commentary of Chizkuni (see my Hebrew commentary, beginning with the fifth edition, p. 535).</i> say that the reason why this son of the Israelite woman required conversion [according to the Torath Kohanim mentioned above], was because he lived before the Giving of the Torah, and his status was determined by that of the male parent, as is to be deduced from what the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">534</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 67 a.</i> “Where [the parents of a child are of] non-Jewish nations, we go [as far as the status of the child is concerned] by that of the father.” And when this [son of the Israelite woman whose father was an Egyptian] was born, they did not circumcise him, for his status was that of an Egyptian, but when he grew up he voluntarily converted and was circumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">535</sup><i class="footnote">All this is the opinion of the “French Rabbis.” Essentially this opinion is based upon the theory that up till the Giving of the Torah the Israelites had a status [in the law of the Torah] similar to that of all other nations, and hence the law quoted [“Where the parents of a child are of non-Jewish nations etc.”] applied. Ramban is now to differ with this opinion, and holds that since Abraham entered the covenant, he and his seed already enjoyed that status later defined as that of Israelites, and under such law the son of the Israelite woman assumed her status, and hence there was no need for his official conversion. The statement of the Torath Kohanim that he was converted must mean only, as explained above, that he was reared by his mother and he became attached to Israel.</i> But such is not my opinion, for since the time that Abraham entered into the covenant [with G-d], they [i.e., his descendants through Isaac and Jacob] were Israelites <i>and were not to be reckoned among the nations</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">536</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 23:9.</i> just as the Rabbis have said with respect to Esau:<sup class="footnote-marker">537</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 18 a.</i> “Perhaps the case of an Israelite who is an apostate is different!” [Thus the Rabbis referred to Esau, who was long before the Giving of the Torah on Sinai, as an “Israelite.”] And is it not an argument from minor to major! “If after the Giving of the Torah when a Cuthean has sexual relations with a daughter of Abraham, and he is forbidden to her by a negative commandment and his betrothal to her is not valid, yet she is the source of purification of the nations, so that her child becomes fully-qualified and of her own standing — does it not follow all the more so that before the Torah was given, she purifies her child to be of her own standing, so that circumcision be incumbent upon him as upon the seed of Abraham, and that he be part of the community of the children of Israel!”

Verse 1

AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN MOUNT SINAI. “What has the subject of the Sabbatical year [stated here in this section] to do with that of Mount Sinai? Were not all the commandments declared on Sinai? [It is to teach us that] just as [this law of] the Sabbatical year was ordained on Sinai with its general rules, its specific prescripts and its minute details, so also were all [the commandments] ordained on Sinai with their general rules, and their specific prescripts and their minute details. Thus it is taught [here] in the Torath Kohanin. It appears to me<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Rashi. Having quoted the text of the Torath Kohanim, Rashi now proceeds to explain the basis of the analogy of this text of the Beraitha between our section and all other commandments. To follow Rashi’s answer it is important to recall that in the final year of Israel’s stay in the wilderness, when they were encamped <i>in the plains of Moab</i> (Numbers 22:1), Moses, in the last days of his life, restated the commandments of G-d, his words being contained in the Book of Deuteronomy. However, since not all the commandments were restated there by Moses, our verse serves as a basis for the interpretation of the Torath Kohanim, as will be explained by Rashi. Ramban will differ with this whole approach, since the text of the Torath Kohanim makes no reference at all to Moses’ restatement of the laws in the plains of Moab. See at end of Note 10.</i> that the following is the interpretation thereof: Since we do not find the law of the resting of the soil [in the Sabbatical year] repeated in the plains of Moab [when Moses restated the law, as contained in the Book of Deuteronomy], we must deduce that all the general rules and specific prescripts [of the Sabbatical year, including those of the resting of the soil] were declared on Sinai. [Why then was it necessary for Scripture to state here <i>in Mount Sinai</i>, since it is self-understood that this entire law was promulgated on Sinai, since the law of the resting of the soil is not mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy? We must say that the reason] Scripture mentioned [the phrase <i>in Mount Sinai</i>] here is in order to teach that every communication [i.e., commandment] that was spoken to Moses on Sinai, was given at Sinai together with its general rules and minute details, and they were [merely] repeated and taught again in the plains of Moab.” Thus far is the language of Rashi.<br>But this does not appear to me to be correct at all. For there are many commandments like the Sabbatical year which were not repeated in the plains of Moab, and [all] we know about their general rules and specific prescripts is that they were promulgated either on Sinai or in the Tent of Meeting [but not specifically on Sinai, as Rashi said]!<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, we can be certain that those commandments which were not mentioned <i>in the plains of Moab</i> [and are recorded in other parts of the Torah], were declared at some preceding time, but we cannot be sure whether they were said with the commandments given at Sinai, or only later on, after the building of the Tabernacle from which G-d communicated to Moses. On what basis, then, does Rashi say that they were all given on Sinai?</i> Moreover, how do we know that the other commandments which were repeated in the plains of Moab are to be likened to the Sabbatical year [which was not repeated? Perhaps this analogy applies only to those commandments which were <i>not</i> repeated in the plains of Moab, like the Sabbatical year; but how do we know that the analogy applies also to those that <i>were</i> repeated by Moses in the plains of Moab, as contained in the Book of Deuteronomy? And how do we know that in the case of those commandments that <i>were</i> repeated by Moses], that only the general rules were declared on Sinai but the specific prescripts were given in the plains of Moab! And indeed it would be more logical to say so, that those commandments which were repeated by Moses, were restated for the sake of explaining their specific prescripts, since on Sinai only their general rules had been declared!<br>But the interpretation of the above Beraitha is clear: The general rules of the Sabbatical year were declared on Sinai, as it is written in the section of <i>‘V’eileh Hamishpatim’</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>):<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:1. Since these ordinances were declared before the Tabernacle was erected, they must perforce have been given on Sinai.</i> <i>And on the seventh year thou shalt let it</i> [i.e., the Land] <i>rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:11.</i> These are the laws of the Sabbatical year in a general way. Here He went back [to this subject] and said that <i>in Mount Sinai</i> all its specific prescripts were also given, since all of them are mentioned in this section. And at the end of this subject it is written, <i>These are the commandments, which the Eternal commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:34.</i> in order to liken all the commandments to the Sabbatical year [previously] mentioned, [teaching] that all of them, likewise, were stated in general terms and with their particular details — that is, all were declared on Sinai. And thus it is taught there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, end of <i>Seder Bechukothai</i>.</i> “<i>These are the commandments</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:34.</i> Henceforth no prophet may promulgate any new thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is a major teaching in Judaism, that the prophets who came after Moses only served to exhort Israel to obey the laws given by Moses, but no new Divine commandments were added.</i> <i>Which the Eternal commanded Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:34.</i> The messenger was [found] deserving before Him Who sent him [since he was the most perfect of all human beings].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim to Torath Kohanim <i>ibid.</i></i> <i>Moses for the children of Israel</i>. It was the merit of Israel that caused [the Divine Glory to rest upon Moses].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">“And that the Torah be given through Moses. For if Israel had not accepted the Torah, the Divine Glory would not have communicated with Moses, because where there is no flock there is no shepherd, and if there is a flock there must be a shepherd” (Rabad in his commentary to Torath Kohanim, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> <i>In Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:34.</i> [this teaches] that all commandments originated at Sinai.” Thus far is the text in the Torath Kohanim. But the reason [that the laws were repeated] in the plains of Moab was only for the purpose of explaining the Torah to the children [of those who had left Egypt, who were born in the wilderness after the Giving of the Torah at Sinai]. This appears to me to be the interpretation [of the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim mentioned] and “it is well and nicely said.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew expression <i>kaftor vaferach</i> literally means “a knop and a flower.” The term is borrowed from the design of the candelabrum (see Exodus 25:33), and here means “a thing of truth, and beautifully stated.” The usage of this expression is found in Bereshith Rabbah 91:12. It has been suggested that since the candelabrum in the Tabernacle represented the light of wisdom, the knops and flowers in the candelabrum symbolized truth beautifully expressed. Hence the expression <i>kaftor vaferach</i> as applied to a dictum of truth well formulated. — In essence, Ramban’s understanding of the Beraitha mentioned by Rashi is as follows: “Why is the expression <i>in Mount Sinai</i> mentioned here? It cannot be to teach us that the <i>general principles</i> of the Sabbatical year were given on Sinai, for all commandments were declared on Sinai in general terms, the Sabbatical year being merely one of them, as expressly stated in Exodus 23:11. Hence the expression here <i>in Mount Sinai</i> must be to teach that all its specific prescripts were also given on Mount Sinai, and from this you may deduce that the verse at the end of the Book of Leviticus, which states, <i>These are the commandments which the Eternal commanded Moses … in Mount Sinai</i> intends to teach us that the specific prescripts of <i>all</i> the laws were also declared on Sinai. — Ramban’s interpretation is thus not based at all on Moses’ restatement of the laws in the plains of Moab, as is that of Rashi, but instead is founded upon the verses in Exodus 23:11, and at the end of Leviticus, as explained.</i><br>Now the reason why this section [of the laws of the Sabbatical year] was written here, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained to be as follows: This is the covenant which was written in the section of <i>‘V’eileh Hamishpatim’</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:4-7: <i>And Moses wrote all the words of the Eternal … And he took the Book of the Covenant</i>.</i> and when the people accepted it upon themselves [by saying] <i>we will do, and obey</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7.</i> then the covenant was made,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> and [Moses] told them this whole section [containing the laws of the Sabbatical year]. Scripture mentioned it in this place in order to put in proximity all the conditions [He laid down for Israel’s inheriting] the Land; for just as He said with reference to forbidden sexual relations that on account of them the Land will vomit them out,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 18:28.</i> so He said in the section of <i>‘Im Bechukothai’</i> (<i>If ye walk in My statutes</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:3.</i> with regard to [not keeping the laws of] the Sabbaths of the Land,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 34.</i> and therefore it was necessary that He mention [here] first [what are the laws of] the Sabbatical years.<br>In my opinion this section is written here in its proper order, for the expression <i>in Mount Sinai</i> means when Moses went up there to receive the <i>second</i> Tablets [and does not refer, as Ibn Ezra interprets it, to the time immediately after the Giving of the Torah, even before Moses went up the mountain to receive the <i>first</i> Tablets of the Law], and the explanation of the matter is as follows: At the beginning of the first forty days of the first Tablets, Moses wrote in the Book of the Covenant <i>all the words of the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:4.</i> and all the ordinances stated there [in that section],<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Chapters 21-23.</i> and he sprinkled the blood of the covenant upon the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> But when the people sinned with the [golden] calf and the Tablets were broken, that was equivalent to a breaking of the covenant with the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to Moses by giving him the second Tablets, He commanded him concerning a new covenant, as it is said, <i>Behold, I make a covenant;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:10.</i> and He repeated there the stringent commandments that had been said in the section of <i>‘V’eileh Hamishpatim’</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:1.</i> at the first covenant, and He [now] stated, <i>Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:27.</i> Now the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to make this second covenant with them with greater stringency, and that it should be upon them by means of oaths and curses, and that it should cover, like the first one, all the original commandments and all the ordinances, as it is said of the first covenant, <i>And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Eternal, and all the ordinances</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 24:3.</i> Therefore Scripture states here at the end of the exhortations, <i>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel, in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:46.</i> this being an allusion to all the commandments and ordinances which had been said at the first covenant, in the section of <i>‘V’eileh Hamishpatim’</i> (<i>And these are the ordinances</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:1.</i> for they were all embodied in this [second] covenant.<br>Now in the Book of the first Covenant, the law of the Sabbatical year was stated in a general way as I have mentioned, as it is said, <i>And on the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow</i> etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:11.</i> and now in this second convenant it was said with its specific prescripts, its minute details, and its penalties. At the time of the first covenant, during the first forty days [after the Giving of the Torah, when Moses went up to the mountain], Moses was commanded concerning the building of the Tabernacle; and when the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled to him and commanded him to make a second covenant for them, Moses came down [from the mountain] <i>and he gave them in commandment all that the Eternal had spoken with him in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:32.</i> including the making of the Tabernacle. Then <i>Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them</i> as at first, <i>These are the words which the Eternal hath commanded that ye should do them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 35:1.</i> when making the Tabernacle. Now they accepted the charge joyfully, and departed from his presence at once, and they all came back and brought the donations, and made the Tabernacle and completed its construction. And as soon as it was set up, <i>He</i> immediately <i>called unto Moses, and the Eternal spoke unto him out of the Tent of Meeting</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 1:1.</i> and He commanded him regarding the offerings and the whole <i>Torath Kohanim</i> [“law of the priests,” i.e., the Book of Leviticus], and Moses immediately commanded them all to Aaron and his sons and to all the children of Israel. When he had finished, he said to them: “G-d further commanded me in Mount Sinai to explain to you [the laws of] the Sabbatical year and of the Jubilee, and to make a new covenant with you concerning all the commandments and ordinances, by means of adjuration and oath.” It was not necessary now [for Moses] to slaughter offerings and sprinkle half of the blood upon the people and half upon the altar, as he had done at the first covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:5-6.</i> because now they were [again] accepting upon themselves the original covenant, with these oaths and adjurations. This is the sense of the expression, <i>which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:46.</i> for it was He Who made with them this [second] covenant, having forgiven them on the basis of these conditions [i.e., the oaths and adjurations mentioned further on in Chapter 26], as I have explained at the end of [<i>Seder</i>] <i>Ki Thisa</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 34:27; 31. See Vol. II, pp. 591-2, 594.</i> Similarly, the covenant at the plains of Moab<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:69. 29:9-13.</i> was made likewise, by means of the people accepting upon themselves the Torah with those oaths and adjurations [mentioned in Deuteronomy Chapter 28], this being the covenant, as it is said, <i>These are the words of the covenant which the Eternal commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:69. Ramban’s point is thus to stress that all subsequent covenants mentioned after the one made at Sinai are merely re-affirmations of the original covenant.</i> The Rabbis of blessed memory have spoken the truth in saying<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Bechukothai</i> 8:9.</i> that among the conditions on which the Land [was given by G-d to Israel] are [those of observing the laws of] the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee, as He will mention in the exhortations,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:34; 43.</i> and they are clearly expressed in this second covenant [as referring to the commandments in this section].

Verse 2

A SABBATH UNTO THE ETERNAL, “[This means] in honor of the Eternal [and that it is not primarily intended for man’s benefit],<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, we are to observe the Sabbatical year primarily as a mark of honor to G-d, and not for our benefit, in that by lying fallow for a year the land will improve. The same applies to the weekly Sabbath, which we celebrate in honor of the Creator of the world, and not primarily because we benefit physically from a day of rest. (Mizrachi).</i> in the same sense as this expression is used in the case of the Sabbath of Creation” [i.e., the weekly Sabbath, of which it is also said, <i>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:10. See note above.</i> This is the language of Rashi. But this was not the intention of the Rabbis in their interpretation,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it is true that in the Torath Kohanim (<i>Behar</i> 1:2) there is such an interpretation of the Rabbis, likening the expression <i>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</i> stated here in the case of the Sabbatical year to that mentioned in the law of the weekly Sabbath. But the intent thereof is not as Rashi presented it, for etc. The full text of the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim will be mentioned further on by Ramban.</i> for all [weekly] Sabbaths, and also the festivals, are in honor of the Eternal, and yet in not one of them [i.e., the festivals] does Scripture say that they are “unto the Eternal.” Instead, it says <i>it shall be a solemn rest unto you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 23:24.</i> and in the case of the Day of Atonement it states, <i>It shall be unto you a Sabbath of solemn rest</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 32.</i> The text of the Beraitha in the Torah Kohanim [quoted by Rashi] is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:2.</i> “<i>A Sabbath unto the Eternal</i>. Just as it says with reference to the Sabbath of Creation, so is it said regarding the Sabbatical year, <i>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</i>.” But the meaning of <i>a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:10. See note above.</i> stated in connection with the Sabbath of Creation, is that <i>on it He ceased from work and rested</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 31:17.</i> and therefore <i>thou shalt not do any manner of work</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:10. See note above.</i> It was with reference to that idea that the Sages, of blessed memory, said that the same expression is also stated in the case of the Sabbatical year, since it is the seventh in [the cycle of] the years [just as the weekly Sabbath is the seventh day in the cycle of days; and the meaning thereof here is that since the seventh year is <i>a Sabbath to the Eternal</i>, as will be explained, we are to desist from working the land].<br>Now here [in the Torath Kohanim mentioned above, the Rabbis] have roused our attention to one of the great secrets of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See in Exodus (Vol. II, p. 341, Note 23).</i> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already given us a hint of it when he wrote: “The meaning of <i>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</i> is like that of the Sabbath-day.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">For just as the Sabbath was given for the purpose of contemplating G-d’s deeds and meditating upon His Torah, so also is the purport of the Sabbatical year, since it is the seventh of the years (Mekor Chayim in his commentary to Ibn Ezra).</i> The secret of the years of the world is alluded to in this place.” [Thus far is Ibn Ezra’s comment.]<br>Bend now your ear to understand that which I am permitted to inform you about it in the words that I will cause you to hear, and if you will be worthy, you will contemplate them [and understand them]. I have already written in <i>Seder Bereshith</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:3 (Vol. I, pp. 61-64).</i> that the six days of creation represent [all] the days of the world, <i>and the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:10. See note above.</i> for on it will be the Sabbath to the Great Name, just as we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Tamid 7:4.</i> “On the seventh day what psalm did the Levites sing [in the Sanctuary? They sang] <i>A Psalm, a Song. For the Sabbath-day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 92:1.</i> — [a song] for the World to Come, which will be wholly a Sabbath, and rest for life everlasting.” Thus the [seven] days [of the week] allude to that which He created in the process of creation, and the [seven] years [of the Sabbatical cycle] refer to that which will occur during the creation of all “the days” of the world. It is for this reason that Scripture was more stringent regarding [the transgression of the laws of] the Sabbatical year than with respect to those guilty of transgressing all other negative commandments, and made it punishable with exile, just as He was stringent with respect to forbidden sexual relations [for which the punishment of the people, as opposed to that of the individual, is also exile];<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 18:28.</i> as it is said, <i>Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:34.</i> and He repeated this matter many times: <i>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 35.</i> and it is further said, <i>And the Land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her Sabbaths</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 43.</i> “And so we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 5:9. Our text of the Mishnah has a variant reading. See my Hebrew commentary p. 167, Note 55.</i> “Exile comes for the delaying of justice, and for the perversion of justice, and for [the neglect of] the year of rest for the Land.” [This stringency of punishment is] because whoever denies it [i.e., the law of the Sabbatical year], does not acknowledge the work of creation and [life in] the World to Come. Similarly the prophet [Jeremiah] was stringent, and decreed exile for neglecting to send [Hebrew] servants to freedom in the seventh year [of their service], as it is said, <i>I made a covenant with your fathers … At the beginning of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother</i> etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 34:13-14. — The verse there reads <i>‘mikeitz sheva shanim’</i>, which is normally translated as “at the <i>end</i> of seven years” (so also in the J.P.S. translation). Ramban in Deuteronomy 15:1, however, brings proofs that the correct meaning in this context is “at the end-year of the seven years”, i.e., at the beginning of seventh year, rather than “at the end of the seventh year.” Thus the Hebrew servant goes free at the <i>beginning</i> of the seventh year [the <i>end-year</i> of the cycle of seven years], and this is indeed the accepted law (Rambam, <i>Hilchoth Avadim</i> 2:1) that he serves for six years. See, however, Yonathan ben Uziel in Jeremiah.</i> for in the case of a servant the seventh year is also like a [complete] Jubilee; and the Jubilee is known also [at the very beginning of the Torah] — from <i>‘Bereshith’</i> (<i>In the beginning</i>) to <i>‘Vayechulu’</i> (<i>And there were finished</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, in the Scriptural account of the creation — commencing with the verse, <i>In the beginning</i> … and concluding with <i>‘Vayechulu’</i> (<i>And there were finished</i>) (2:1) — the secret of the Jubilee is already hinted at, namely, “that all things, that came into existence in the beginning of time will be finished in the era of the Jubilee (Beiur Ha’lvush to Ricanti who quotes the language of Ramban).</i> — intimating that in the Jubilee everything is to return [to its origin], <i>every man unto his possession, and every man unto his family</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 10.</i> For it is <i>a sure foundation</i>, and <i>he that believeth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 28:16. The verse reads: <i>He that believeth will not ‘yachish’</i> (<i>make haste</i>). Ramban brings out ingeniously a different meaning by saying: he that believeth <i>‘yacharish’</i> (will keep silence), suggesting that the student of Cabala must be reticent and careful not to disclose the secrets he has learned. Cf. the phrase in Amos 5:13 — <i>‘Therefore ‘hamaskil yidom’</i>. (<i>he who understands will keep quiet</i>)!</i> shall keep silence. This is what is meant in saying, <i>‘v’shavtah ha’aretz shabbath’</i> (<i>and ‘the land’ shall keep a Sabbath</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 2 before us. The word <i>ha’aretz</i> is here understood as “the earth” in its entirety [not merely one particular part of it], the same interpretation applying to the next verses quoted. See further, Note 194.</i> <i>and ye shall proclaim liberty ‘ba’aretz’</i> (<i>throughout ‘the land’</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 10.</i> for the reference here is to “the land of eternal life” which is alluded to in the first verse [of the Torah],<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>In the beginning G-d created the heavens ‘v’eth ha’aretz’</i>, which means “the land of eternal life.”</i> and of which it is said, <i>‘v’ha’aretz ezkor’</i> (<i>and I will remember ‘the land’</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:42.</i> I have already mentioned this several times.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See Vol. I, pp. 110, and 120.</i> Perhaps it is to this that our Rabbis alluded in saying:<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 21 b. See also Vol. I, pp. 9-10.</i> “Fifty gates [degrees] of understanding were created in the world, and all were transmitted to Moses with one exception.” For each cycle of seven years constitutes “the gate of one house” [creation], and thus He informed him of all existence from beginning to end, with the exception of the holy Jubilee.

Verse 3

SIX YEARS THOU SHALT SOW THY FIELD. Such is the way of Scripture to state [i.e., it is not a <i>command</i> that is expressed here, but it is merely the style of Scripture], just as it says, <i>Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:9.</i> <i>Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:12.</i> According to the way of our Rabbis [the verse is to be interpreted as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi, Kilayim VIII, 1.</i> “<i>Six years thou shalt sow thy field</i> — but not in the seventh year — this being a negative commandment which is derived from a positive commandment, and carries the force of a positive commandment.” Thus he who sows [his field] in the seventh year violates this positive commandment, and also the negative commandment [expressed in the verse, <i>thou shalt not sow thy field</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> A homiletic exposition of the Rabbis is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Mechilta, <i>Kaspa</i> 20.</i> “Rabbi Yishmael says: When Israel does the will of G-d, it has to observe only one year of rest [of the soil] in a seven-year cycle, as it is said, <i>Six years thou shalt sow thy field</i>. But if the people do not do the will of G-d, they have to make four ‘years of rest’ of the soil in one seven-year cycle. How so? He plows for one year and cannot sow until the next year, again he plows for one year and cannot sow until the next year. Thus there are four ‘years of rest’ in one seven-year cycle.”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The thought expressed is as follows: When Israel observes the law of the Sabbatical year G-d blesses the produce of the Land during the next six years. But if the law of the Torah is not observed, the farmer must leave his field fallow every alternate year in order to preserve the soil. Thus if the law of the Sabbatical year is observed, only one year of rest of the Land is required in a seven-year cycle, but where the law of the Torah is not observed, there must be four years of rest — the first, the third, the fifth, and the seventh. The meaning of the verse, according to this Mechilta [which is, as Ramban calls it here, “a homiletic exposition”], is thus: “six full years you will be able to sow your field without recourse to a rest of the Land, if in the seventh year there shall be a solemn rest for the Land” (Zeh Yenachameinu — a commentary upon the Mechilta).</i>

Verse 4



Verse 5

ETH S’FIACH K’TZIRCHA’ (THAT WHICH GROWETH OF ITSELF OF THY HARVEST) THOU SHALT NOT REAP. “Even if you did not sow it, but it grew from the seed that had fallen [into the ground] at the time of the harvest [of the sixth year], and it is that which is called <i>‘s’fiach’</i> (aftergrowth) — <i>thou shalt not reap</i>, to take possession of it like other harvests, but is to be free for everyone. AND THE GRAPES OF ‘N’ZIRECHA’ — which you have barred and separated from people, and not declared ownerless — THOU SHALT NOT GATHER them. You may only gather them after they have been declared free for all.” Thus the language of Rashi.<br>The Rabbi’s [i.e., Rashi’s] meaning by [writing] this is because he is of the opinion that if a person guards his field and his fruits in the Sabbatical year [at the time of growth, and afterwards he declares them free for all], the produce does not become prohibited [as food]. So also did he [Rashi] write in his commentaries to Tractate Yebamoth<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 122 a.</i> and to Tractate Succah.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Succah 39 b.</i> This is indeed so according to the law of the Torah, as is established by clear proofs. And that which is taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:3.</i> “<i>And the grapes of ‘n’zirecha’ thou shalt not gather</i>. From that which was guarded when in the soil [i.e., when it is in the process of growth] you shall not gather, but you may gather from that which was made free for all”<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">From this text you might understand that if the fruits were guarded whilst they were growing, they become completely prohibited for ever. But this is not correct. Rashi will explain the text etc.</i> — the Rabbi [Rashi] will explain it in the following way: “Grapes which have been kept away from people you may not gather as long as they are so barred; you must rather declare them all ownerless, and then you may gather them together with the poor.”<br>The correct interpretation of the verse is that the expression <i>the grapes of ‘n’zirecha’</i> is like <i>‘s’fiach’ of thy harvest</i>, and <i>thou shalt not gather</i> is like <i>thou shalt not reap</i>, for the purport of the whole section is to state a twofold law to the Israelites — warning with respect to fields and warning again with reference to vineyards. Thus: <i>thou shalt sow thy field … thou shalt prune thy vineyard;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 3.</i> <i>thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> Similarly, <i>And six years thou shalt sow thy Land … but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow … In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:10-11.</i> And the meaning of the verse [here] is that that which grows by itself in a field without intentional plowing and sowing is called “<i>s’fiach</i> of the harvest,” because it is “attached” to the harvest of the past year, this term being of the root, <i>‘v’nispechu’</i> (<i>and they shall cleave</i>) <i>to the house of Jacob</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 14:1.</i> Likewise the vine which has not been cultivated, nor hoed or pruned, is called <i>nazir</i>, because [the owner] “held himself aloof and put it away from him” as if it were not his, of the root, <i>because ‘nazoru’ from Me through their idols</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 14:5.</i> [which means] “they separated themselves from Me.” Similarly, <i>‘v’yinazru’</i> (<i>and they separate themselves</i>) <i>from the holy things of the children of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 22:2.</i> And Onkelos [also] translates here [<i>and the grapes of ‘n’zirecha’</i>] as <i>shivkach</i>, which means [those grapes that] “you have left” to be <i>for briers and thorns</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 7:23.</i><br>It is possible that the custom in Israel was that a vineyard <i>which was uncultivated, neither pruned nor hoed, and in which briers and thorns</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>, 5:6.</i> <i>grew up</i>, they called <i>nazir</i>, that is to say, it is a vineyard of the Nazirite, since the Nazirite is forbidden to drink wine <i>nor eat fresh grapes or dried</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:3.</i> and he does not cultivate his vineyard. They also gave a name to long hair derived from the Nazirite, as it is said, <i>Cut off ‘nizreich’</i> (<i>thy hair</i>) <i>and cast it away</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 7:29.</i> This then is the sense of [the expression here] <i>the grapes of ‘n’zirecha,’</i> the general purport thereof being that they are the grapes which grow without cultivation of the vineyard. Thus Scripture is stating that that which grows by itself in the field he may not reap, and the grapes which grow in the vineyard without work he may not gather. And the meaning of these negative commandments is that you may not reap them alone for your own needs, nor are you to gather the grapes for yourself [only], but <i>it shall be a year of solemn rest for the Land</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5 before us.</i> from sowing and pruning, <i>and the Sabbath-produce of the Land</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> that is, whatever the Land brings forth in its rest, whether <i>s’fiach</i> or <i>nazir</i> [as explained above] <i>shall be unto</i> all of <i>you</i> together <i>for food, for thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> and for thy poor, and for the beast and for the cattle.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">See Verses 6-7.</i><br>Now I will return to explain the Beraithoth taught in the Torath Kohanim on this subject, because they are misleading [in their plain sense]. On the verse, <i>And if ye shall say: ‘What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 20.</i> the Rabbis taught there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim. <i>Behar</i> 4:5.</i> “If people do not sow, what is there to gather? [So why then did Scripture prohibit gathering the increase, since there can be none to gather without sowing?] Said Rabbi Akiba: It is from here that the Sages found a Scriptural source for <i>s’fichin</i> (aftergrowths), [indicating] that they are forbidden in the Sabbatical year.” This Beraitha is quoted in the Gemara [of Tractate Pesachim] in the Chapter <i>Makom Shenahagu</i> (“<i>A place where the custom is”</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Pesachim 51 b.</i> And it is further taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim. <i>Behar</i> 4:5.</i> “But the Sages say: Aftergrowths are not forbidden by law of the Torah, but only by decree of the Scribes. If so, why is it said, <i>behold, we may not sow, nor gather?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 20.</i> [It means as follows:] You have told us not to sow, and what there is for us to gather — [the aftergrowths] — we may not bring in for storage [after the time of the Removal];<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban further, Verse 7 for a full discussion of this law.</i> and then You have told us, ‘Remove it [from the house],’ what then shall we eat from the time of the Removal onwards?” Thus far [are the words of the Torath Kohanim].<br>Thus it is clear that according to the words of the Sages the prohibition of aftergrowths is only by law of the Rabbis, that is to say, it is they who decreed that they be prohibited altogether, because of the suspicion that the owners might sow and say that these are aftergrowths. It is for this reason that the Rabbis have said in the Yerushalmi:<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi, Baba Bathra V, 1. The translation follows the commentary of P’nei Moshe there.</i> “Rabbi Yannai said: All aftergrowths are forbidden [under the law forbidding theft, i.e., since they belong to the owner of the field, they may not be taken by a stranger during the non-Sabbatical years], except for those which come up in an uncultivated field, a plowed field, a field containing a vineyard, or a field sowed [with fenugreek]. [The aftergrowths of] an uncultivated field [are permissible to a stranger] because the owner pays no attention to such a field [and therefore it is considered ownerless]. A plowed field — the owner desires to clear of all growths. A field containing a vineyard — the owner does not want to forfeit his vineyard<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:9.</i> [because the aftergrowths of the grain in the vineyard constitute diverse kinds which are forbidden, and so he welcomes their being taken out by anyone]. A field sowed [with fenugreek] — the owner does not want to maintain aftergrowths therein [because they harm the fenugreek].”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the aftergrowths of these four kinds of fields may be taken by anyone during all normal years, because the owners consider these growths ownerless; and in the Sabbatical year, since the owners are not suspected of having violated the law against planting them, they are permissible to the owners together with everyone else. But in all other fields, since the aftergrowths during any non-Sabbatical year are forbidden to be taken by strangers because the owners do not wish to relinquish their possession of them, in the Sabbatical year they are subject to the law of aftergrowths, as will be explained.</i><br>It is on the basis of this division of opinion [between Rabbi Akiba, who says that aftergrowths are forbidden in the Sabbatical year by law of the Torah, and the Sages, who are of the opinion that they are forbidden only by Rabbinical decree], that it is taught there in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:3.</i> “<i>That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap</i>. It is from here that they found a Scriptural source for forbidding aftergrowths in the Sabbatical year.” They thus gave their teaching in accordance with the words of Rabbi Akiba, [who explains the phrase] <i>thou shalt not reap</i> as [prohibiting] altogether [any reaping, even of aftergrowths, by law of the Torah], But according to the words of the Sages [the verse means] that you are not to reap them [solely] for yourself, nor are you to gather the grapes [of your undressed vine solely] for yourself, but you are to treat them as if they were ownerless property. Similarly, <i>and we do not gather in our increase</i><sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 20.</i> means that we do not gather [entirely] into our homes the fruits of the tree [which grow by themselves] nor the aftergrowths [of crops], because we must declare them ownerless for the poor, the beasts and the cattle, and at the time of Removal,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban further, Verse 7 for a full discussion of this law.</i> [and therefore one might say that] we are not able to live on them [since we cannot use them entirely as our own possession.]!<br>Now these aftergrowths which are forbidden according to Rabbi Akiba are those which have grown in the forbidden season. [i.e., the Sabbatical year]: in grain, all that has reached a third of its growth in the Sabbatical year, and in the case of vegetables, whatever has sprouted in the Sabbatical year are forbidden by law of the Torah. But according to the Sages they are forbidden by decree of the Scribes, except for those [aftergrowths] which come up in any of those [four kinds of] fields mentioned in the Yerushalmi<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi, Baba Bathra V, 1. The translation follows the commentary of P’nei Moshe there.</i> which we have quoted above. However, vegetables that sprouted in the sixth year but were harvested in the seventh, are also subject to all the laws of the sanctity of the Sabbatical year [regarding Seventh year produce, which are as follows]: they must not be wasted [as they were given for food;<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> their money substitute may not be used] for [obligatory] offerings;<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">For if a person has an obligation to bring any offering, as for instance if he commits one of those sins for which he must bring a sin-offering, etc., he must discharge his duty from unhallowed money, and since the money-substitute of the Seventh-year produce is as sacred as the original produce, therefore this obligatory offering cannot be bought with this money.</i> [they may not be used] for the purpose of trade, and they are subject to the law of Removal.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban further, Verse 7 for a full discussion of this law.</i> For even though these vegetables grew completely in the sixth year [nonetheless if they were harvested in the seventh year, they are subject to the laws of the Sabbatical year], because we follow in the case of vegetables the time of collecting them in, whether for tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">In the first and second years of the Sabbatical cycle, as well as in the fourth and fifth years, the First and Second Tithes are given of all produce, while in the third and sixth years, the First and the Poorman’s Tithes are given. The First Tithe is given to the Levite; the Second Tithe belongs to the owner, but he must eat it in Jerusalem. The Poorman’s Tithe is given to the poor, and they may eat it wherever they are. Now each group of produce has different rules to determine which is the relevant year for its specific tithes, since different factors apply; for instance: the fruits, crops and vegetables. The point here is that in the case of vegetables the determining factor is the time when they are gathered. Hence if, for example, the vegetables grew in the second year and were collected in the third, the tithes given are the First and Poorman’s Tithes. Similarly, if they grew in the sixth year and were collected in the seventh, the laws of the Sabbatical year apply to these vegetables, as specifically explained in the text.</i> or for the Sabbatical year. But the law of aftergrowths does not apply to them, for they are not aftergrowths of the Sabbatical year since they grew in the sixth year, and even if they continued [their growth] in the seventh year, the law of aftergrowths does not apply to them. It is with reference to such vegetables that we were taught [in the Mishnah]:<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Shevi’ith 8:4.</i> “If a man said to a laborer [in the Sabbatical year], ‘Here you have an <i>issar</i> [a coin equivalent to one twenty-fourth of the silver <i>dinar</i>], and gather me vegetables today’, his payment is permitted etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the laborer is not restricted to buying only food, drink, or unguents with the money, as would have been the case if the money were subject to the laws of the sanctity of the Sabbatical year. “But if he said to him, ‘In return for it [i.e., the <i>issar</i>] gather me vegetables today,’ his payment is forbidden” [i.e., he is restricted to using the money only for the above-mentioned purposes]. The difference between these two cases is generally explained to be that the latter transaction resembles a sale [<i>in exchange</i> for the coin he gathers for him the vegetables], and it is forbidden to sell Seventh-year produce; therefore the money is “seized” with the sanctity of the original produce.</i> And similarly we were taught [there] in a Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Shevi’ith 7:3.</i> “A man may not gather in the [wild] vegetables in a field and sell them in the market; but he may gather them in and his son may sell them for him;” and we were also taught there:<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:1.</i> “Rue, goosefoot, etc. may be bought from anyone in the Sabbatical year, since no watch is kept over the like of these” [wild vegetables, and, since they are ownerless, the sanctity of the Sabbatical year does not apply to them].<br>Now some [scholars] say<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">This opinion is stated by Rambam, <i>Hilchoth Sh’mitah V’yoveil</i> 4:3. See my Hebrew commentary p. 170 for the text.</i> that [in the case of] these vegetables mentioned [in the above Mishnah] and all similar ones, which people do not usually sow, but which grow by themselves on mountains and near rivers, the prohibition of aftergrowths does not apply to them at all even though they grew in the Sabbatical year, since the Rabbis only forbade [the aftergrowths of] those things which are normally planted, in order that one should not plant them [in the Sabbatical year and then say that they grew by themselves]. And so it appears from the Gemara of the Yerushalmi [mentioned above]. This is the subject of “aftergrowths” whenever the Sages mention it [in the Talmud].<br>Similarly it is [forbidden by law] of the Torah for a person to guard his field and lock it up from the poor in the Sabbatical year, even if he intends to declare them free for all at the time of gathering them in; instead, the field is to be ready and free for the poor throughout the year. Thus the Sages taught in the Mechilta:<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Mechilta, <i>Kaspa</i> 20.</i> “<i>That the poor of thy people may eat</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:11.</i> ‘Why did the Torah say this? Was it not so that the poor may eat it? If so, I am going to gather in the fruit and distribute it among the poor’. Therefore Scripture states, <i>But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:11.</i> This teaches that the owner is even [obliged] to make breaches in the fence [so that everyone may come and take]. The Sages, however, as a precaution for the general good, allowed him to keep the fence.” Now the restraining measure which the Sages established was only that he need not make breaches in the fences of his field and vineyard, but not that he may guard his field and gather in the fruits, thereby transgressing the words of the Torah. Moreover, the Sages even decreed against buying fruits which have been guarded, or even from one who is under suspicion of so [guarding]. It is with reference to this that we have been taught in the Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:1.</i> “[The wild vegetables mentioned] may be bought from anyone in the Sabbatical year, since no watch is kept over the like of these.” And in Tractate Succah the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Succah 39 a-b.</i> “One may not hand over to those ignorant of the law more of the monetary equivalent of fruits of the Sabbatical year than that needed for three meals.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Three meals are needed for the Sabbath, and since it is permitted to give it to him before the Sabbath in order that he may buy the three required meals, it is permitted throughout the week (<i>ibid.</i>). See also the following note for fuller explanation.</i> This applies only where he buys [the fruits] from a field which was free for all,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, if the <i>chaver</i> (a person who is faithful in observing the law) sees the owner [who is ignorant of the law] taking the fruits from an unguarded field, he may give him the monetary equivalent of three meals’ worth of fruits; but he is not permitted to give the owner more money than that required for three meals, for since such money must be spent according to the restrictions of the sanctity of the Sabbatical year [i.e., he must spend it only for food, drink or unguent] it is feared that the seller receiving such money may not do so. But the Sages permitted the <i>chaver</i> to give him the monetary equivalent of three meals so that he may have sufficient food for himself [for a day] (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>).</i> but if he buys from a guarded field, even the value of half an <i>issar</i> is forbidden.” And the reason for this is as follows: When the purchaser buys it from a field which was free for all — that is to say, from things which people usually bring from ownerless property, or if it is known that he brought them from a place which was declared free for all — then [the purchaser who knows and observes the law] is permitted to buy the fruit. However, if he gives the owner more money than is needed for his [three] meals on that day, we suspect that the [seller who is] ignorant of the law might use [this money] for the purpose of business [which he is forbidden to do]. But if he buys things which it is customary to guard, then even if it is [no more than the value of] half an <i>issar</i>, we suspect that [the seller, being ignorant of the law], guarded them, in which case it is forbidden to buy from him. However if he buys a <i>perutah’s</i> worth of fruits, or less than half an <i>issar</i>, the Sages did not prohibit this, because it is customary for people to gather them in from any [unguarded] place, even during the other years of the Sabbatical cycle.<br>It is referring to this that the Sages have taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Yebamoth 122 a.</i> “If a non-Jew was selling fruits in the market, and he said [by way of praising his products], ‘These fruits are <i>orlah</i> [of the first three years’ growth, and are therefore better than the fruit of an old tree], or ‘they are of <i>azeikah</i>’ [a term explained further on], he has said nought [i.e., we do not believe his statement that the fruits are <i>orlah</i> etc., and hence forbidden; instead we say that these fruits come from the majority of trees which are nor <i>orlah</i>, and they therefore may be eaten]. For the seller only intended to praise his products.” Now Rashi explained there in the name of the early scholars,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">See in <i>Seder Emor</i>, Note 485.</i> [that the term <i>azeikah</i> means that the fruits come] from an orchard “that is enclosed” with a fence around it, and it happens to be the Sabbatical year. Now if we were to believe him [the non-Jewish seller], it would be forbidden to buy the fruits from him in a city wherein most [of the inhabitants] are Jews, lest he is a tenant-laborer of a Jew and guards the field for him; or we would suspect that he may have gathered [these fruits] from a field belonging to a Jew [who has not declared them free for all] and he sells them; or that the fruits belong to a Jew and he is selling them for him. Or perhaps [even if the land belongs to the seller], a gentile cannot make such an acquisition in the Land of Israel as to negate the laws of the Sabbatical year [from his produce]. The Rabbis therefore decreed that the fruits of his field are to be regarded as those of an Israelite [and hence subject to all the laws of the Sabbatical year]. Nonetheless, the Sages did not prohibit the fruits of a guarded field [in the Sabbatical year] to everybody, but only [decreed] that one should not buy them directly from the owner who guarded them [but it is not the fruits themselves of a guarded field which are prohibited; thus if they have already been sold to a first purchaser, another Jew may buy them from him]. Therefore the Rabbis taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:3.</i> “<i>And the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather</i>. From that which was guarded when in the land you are not to gather, but you may gather from that which was free for all. <i>Thou shalt not gather</i>, in the [ordinary] manner of those who gather grapes. It was on the basis of this that the Sages said: ‘Seventh-year figs may not be cut with a special fig-knife [but may be cut with an ordinary knife]; grapes may not be pressed in a wine-press, but one may press them in a vat.’” And the meaning thereof is as follows: Since it is not written “the grapes of the undressed vine thou shalt not reap,” but instead it is written <i>‘thy’ undressed vine</i>, it is to be interpreted that you are not to gather them in the way you usually gather your grapes, but you may gather them together with the poor in the way that they gather them, meaning to say that he is not to guard them for himself, but he is to gather them with the poor as if they were ownerless. Similarly he is to treat them [after he has gathered them in] as the poor do, and press them in a vat. And it is further taught there [in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 1:5.</i> “<i>And the Sabbath-produce of the Land shall be for food for you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> You are to eat from that which rested in the land [as will be explained], but you may not eat from that which was guarded. Hence the dictum of the Sages:<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Shevi’ith 4:2.</i> The School of Shammai say, one may not eat from the produce of a field which has been industriously tilled.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah refers to a time when the Rabbis permitted tilling the ground <i>once</i> in the Sabbatical year in order to enable the people to pay the Roman government the tax imposed on land, as failure to do so could have led to mortal danger. But if the owner tilled the land <i>twice</i>, the question arises whether the produce thereof may be eaten, since a field which was tilled twice is treated as a field that was guarded.</i> But the School of Hillel say that one may eat of it.’” That is to say, since the Torah stated that the produce of the Sabbath should be for us for food, and not that which was guarded, the School of Shammai say that the fruits themselves become prohibited [and therefore the produce of a field which was tilled twice, and considered as a field that was guarded, may not be eaten]; but the School of Hillel are of the opinion that the fruits themselves are not prohibited, for Scripture’s intention is only to forbid us to guard [our produce], in order that our crops should be from a field in which the Sabbatical rest was observed. Similarly when the Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Shevi’ith 8:6, and referred to in the Torath Kohanim (<i>Behar</i> 1:3) mentioned above.</i> that seventh-year figs may not be cut with a [special] fig-knife, and grapes may not be pressed in a wine-press, [these laws are] a “fence” and guard of Rabbinic origin, in order that people should not come to guard and gather in their crops, and rob them from the poor. This is [the meaning of] that which is taught here in these Beraithoth [of the Torath Kohanim], and it is the best and clearest exposition of the discussions in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Gemara. The scholar who is acquainted [with the Talmud] will succeed in finding these texts.

Verse 6

AND ‘SHABBATH HA’ARETZ’ (THE SABBATH-PRODUCE OF THE LAND) SHALL BE FOR FOOD FOR YOU. Because He said <i>it shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the Land</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 4.</i> He states [here] that the rest mentioned <i>shall be for food for you</i> to maintain all of you — you and your servant, and the cattle and the beast — so that you should all support yourselves from that which the land will bring forth by itself whilst it is resting. Or [it may be that] the year itself is called <i>shabbath ha’aretz</i>, just as the [seventh] day is called “the Sabbath of the Eternal,”<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 23:38: <i>Beside the Sabbaths of the Eternal</i>.</i> or just “Sabbath;” and the reference thereof is to the produce of the Sabbath [year], for the Sabbath [year] itself is not something to be eaten.

Verse 7

AND FOR THY CATTLE, AND FOR THE BEASTS THAT ARE IN THY LAND, SHALL ALL THE INCREASE THEREOF BE FOR FOOD. “If wild beasts may eat thereof, how much more so is this the case with cattle which it is your duty to feed! Why then does it say <i>and for thy cattle</i>? [Scripture mentioned it] in order to liken cattle to the beast. As long as the wild beast is able to eat of [the produce of] the field, you may feed your cattle with that [which is stored] in the house; when food has disappeared for the wild beast in the field, remove it [what is stored] for your cattle from the house [and make it available to all animals alike].” This is Rashi’s language, taken from the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:8.</i><br>The Rabbi [Rashi] did not, however, explain [the meaning of] this Removal. Its purport is that after a certain time the owner must remove all produce from his house and declare it ownerless [i.e., after food has disappeared for the wild beast from the field], this being “the Removal of the Seventh-year [produce]” which the Sages mention everywhere. Now the intention thereof is not that after the time of Removal it is forbidden for him to derive benefit from the produce or to eat, and that the owner must destroy it, for the Sages have not listed the fruits of the Seventh year in the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Temurah 33 b.</i> among those things that must be burnt, nor among those that must be buried. Rather, [the meaning of the Removal] is only that he must remove them from his control, and declare them free for the poor and for all people, similar to that which it says, <i>I have put away the hallowed things out of my house</i><sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 26:13.</i> [in which case it obviously does not mean that he destroys <i>the hallowed things</i>, but rather that he gives them to whomever they belong, e.g. the heave-offering to the priest, etc.]. And so we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Shevi’ith 9:8.</i> “The poor may eat [of the produce] after the Removal, but not the rich. These are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosei says: Both the poor and the rich may eat of the produce after the Removal.” The meaning of the term “the poor” is all people who gather the produce of fields of other people which have been declared ownerless, and “the rich” means the owners of the fields themselves, who gathered the produce of their own fields after they declared them free for all. Now Rabbi Yehudah declared that they [these “rich” former owners] are forbidden by law of the Rabbis to gather in from their own fields, on account of suspicion [that they did not really intend to make their fields free for all], but Rabbi Yosei permitted them [to gather in from their own fields], and the final decision of the law is according to his words. This Mishnah is also found in the Torah Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 1:6.</i><br>And in the Tosephta it is stated:<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Tosephta Shevi’ith 8:1-4. On “Tosephta” see above in <i>Seder Tazria</i>, Note 124.</i> “Originally messengers of the court would go around the entrances of the cities; if anyone had brought the produce [of the Seventh year] into his possession, they would take it from him and give him enough food for three meals, and the rest they would put into a store-house in the city. When the time of [the ripening of] figs came, the court’s messengers would hire workers to pick them, and they would make them into cakes of pressed figs [and then put them into the store-house in the city]. When the time [of the ripening] of olives came, the court’s messengers would hire workers to harvest them, press them in olive-presses and put [the oil] into barrels, and then they would put them into the store-house in the city. When the time of [the ripening of] grapes came, the court’s messengers would hire workers to gather them, press them in a wine-press and put [the wine] into barrels, and they would put them into the store-house in the city. On the day preceding the [weekly] Sabbath they would distribute the food from them [the store-houses] to each and every one according to the needs of his family. When the time of the Removal arrived, the poor would eat after the Removal, but not the rich. These are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosei says: Both poor and rich may eat after the Removal. Rabbi Shimon says: The rich may eat from the store-house after the Removal.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">For with respect to the store-house, all people are regarded as “poor,” but an owner of a field may not eat of his own fruits after the Removal. Rabbi Shimon’s teaching is thus a sort of middle position between that of Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Yosei.</i> [When the time of the Removal came] he who had produce to distribute gave it to the poor. If someone had produce of the Seventh year [and he lived in a place where there was no store-house, nor a functioning court to supervise the distribution], and the time of Removal was come, he would distribute some of it to his neighbors, relatives and friends, and [the remainder] he would take out and place at the door of his house, and say: ‘Brethren, house of Israel! Whoever has to take, let him come and take!’ And then he may bring [the rest] back into his house and continue to eat of it until it is finished.”<br>All this is taught in the Tosephta, and from it we clearly learn that the term “Removal” only means that [the Seventh-year produce] must be taken out of the owner’s possession, and that he must declare it free for all, and that [for the fulfillment of this law] the Rabbis made various ordinances. Originally the court used to make a store-house in each and every city. As soon as the fruits ripened, they would take them from those who brought them [from their fields] and put them into the store-house. Thus when the time of the harvest for the whole of that crop would arrive, such as when the time had come for reaping the grain or gathering the grapes, the [messengers of the] court would hire workers to gather the grapes, pick the olives and harvest the whole of that species, and then they would press the grapes in a wine-press and the olives in an olive-press as one does during any other year, and put them into their store-house. Now this produce which was gathered into the store-house of the court required no other act of “Removal,” since they were already removed from the homes [of their owners], and both poor and rich were permitted after the time of the Removal to come and receive them from the court’s messengers, and to eat them. All this ordinance and trouble taken by the court was on account of suspicion, that [if the court were not to act in this manner] people would hold on to it [the produce of the Seventh year] or do business with it. And where there was no store-house in the city, nor a [functioning] court, and the produce remained in the hands of he who gathered it in from ownerless property, then he must remove it from his house when the time of Removal comes, and declare it free for all at the door of his house, and from then on he is permitted to continue eating from it [as long as it lasts]. This is [what the Rabbis meant in saying<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim 58 a.</i> that] Seventh-year produce renders forbidden [a mixture] of its own kind in the smallest of quantities as far as the Removal is concerned,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Thus if a person took an onion which grew in the sixth year [of the Sabbatical cycle] and replanted it in the seventh year, even though it only grows a small amount in the seventh year the whole onion is subject to the law of Removal, as if it had grown entirely in the seventh year. Normally any forbidden food which becomes unrecognizable in a mixture the majority of which consists of permitted food, is considered negligible and “annulled” by the majority according to the law of the Torah [however, the Rabbis usually required a ratio of 60:1, for the forbidden food to become annulled]. However, any forbidden food which will at some future time have a permitted status, can never become annulled even if it is a minute part of the permitted part of the mixture; for why should we annul it now when it will eventually become permitted automatically? Here too, since the minute forbidden part of the onion which grew in the seventh year will automatically become permitted to be eaten when the owner declares it free for all at the time of Removal, it does not become annulled by the rest of the onion. Thus the whole of the onion is subject to the law of Removal [since we do not know which is the bit which grew in the seventh year]; and if the owner does not declare it free for all, it is completely forbidden. Ramban quotes this to prove that Removal does not mean destruction of the produce, but merely declaring it free for all, as the Gemara clearly states that it becomes permitted after Removal.</i> as is mentioned in Tractate Nedarim,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim 58 a.</i> because it may be rendered permissible by removal from his house.<br>Now I have found the following comment of Rashi which he wrote in Tractate Pesachim:<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Pesachim 58 a.</i> “And it is this which constitutes their ‘removal’ — that he is to make them free for all in a place where human beings and animals tread.” Perhaps the Rabbi thought that the owner has to make it free also for beasts and cattle, in order to fulfill that which is written concerning them, <i>that the poor of thy people may eat</i>, [<i>and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:11.</i> <i>and for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy Land</i> [<i>shall all the increase thereof be for food</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7 before us.</i> In this he [Rashi] has stated the matter too strongly, for [as we explain it] eating of the produce [after the Removal] is not prohibited at all. And the Rabbis have already taught in the Tosephta that the Removal of the [produce of the] Seventh year is like the removal [mentioned] in connection with the Second Tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 26:13.</i>, and there is no difference between them as far as prohibition of eating them [for just as the Second Tithe is eaten, so the Seventh-year produce may be eaten].<br>Now Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon]<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Sh’mitah V’yoveil</i> 7:3.</i> and many of the Sages<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Such as Rabad (Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posqieres) who agrees with Rambam on this point (Keseph Mishneh <i>ibid.</i>).</i> are, however, of the opinion that the Removal renders the produce completely forbidden, and it must be burnt, or spread about and scattered in the wind, or thrown into the sea. But it is not so, as has been explained. If, however, he retained it in his home after the [time for the] Removal so that he may eat thereof, then it does become completely forbidden as food. This is the Seventh-year produce which renders [a mixture of a <i>different</i> kind] forbidden, [but only] if it is enough to give [the entire mixture] its flavor, since it has no permitted status [after the Removal; and therefore if the Seventh-year produce is not enough to give its flavor into the entire mixture, it becomes “annulled” by the majority of permitted food, but if it is enough to give it its flavor, it is not annulled].<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">See Note 121 above.</i> It is possible that this prohibition is [only] by law of the Rabbis; perhaps even the whole matter of Removal is a stringency imposed by the Scribes, and the Beraithoth taught in the Torath Kohanim on the subject of Removal are only Scriptural supports for a matter which is of Rabbinic origin.<br>On this basis the following Mishnah can be well-explained:<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Shevi’ith 9:5.</i> “If one pickles three kinds of vegetables [of Seventh-year produce] in a single barrel etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">“Rabbi Eliezer says: they may be eaten only as long as the first [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Even until the last [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field, etc.” Ramban intends to say that if, as mentioned above, the whole law of Removal of Seventh-year produce is only a decree of Rabbinic origin, we may well understand why Rabbi Yehoshua is lenient in this case. — See also Ramban further on in Verse 12 where he quotes this whole text from the Torath Kohanim, and it is more fully explained.</i> Similarly [we may well understand] the following Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:1.</i> “Three countries are to be distinguished as regards the Seventh year.” There we are taught: “Throughout that part of the Land of Israel which those that came up from Babylon occupied, as far as Chezib,<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">This is the city of Achzib, mentioned in Joshua 19:29, and Judges 1:31. It was in the vicinity of Acco, as is clear from the verse in the Book of Judges (Tifereth Yisrael). To understand this Mishnah it is important to remember that the sanctity first imparted to the Land of Israel by Joshua’s conquests came to an end with the destruction of the First Temple. Now when the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile and reoccuppied the Land, their settlement was not as large as that originally occupied by those that came up from Egypt. The sanctity imparted to this part of the Land which was re-occupied by the Babylonian exiles was never lost again; and it is to this part that the laws of the Seventh year fully apply.</i> [Seventh-year produce] may not be eaten [without Removal], and [the land] may not be cultivated. Throughout that part of the Land which those that came up from Egypt occupied [but which was not later occupied by those that came up from the Babylonian captivity], from Chezib<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 6:1.</i> to the river<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Brook of Egypt (Joshua 15:47) in the south (Tifereth Shlomoh).</i> and [from Chezib] to Amanah,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Mount Hor (Numbers 34:7) to the north. The Mishnah thus covers two points from Chezib: from the south thereof to the Brook of Egypt, and from the north thereof to Mount Hor (Tifereth Shlomoh).</i> [Seventh-year produce] may be eaten [without Removal], but [the land] may not be cultivated.” Thus the Sages were more lenient as regards eating [the Seventh-year produce] after the time of Removal [without having gone through the actual act of Removal] than they were as regards cultivating [the land].<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">As suggested above by Ramban, the reason for this leniency concerning Removal may be that the whole matter is of Rabbinic origin.</i> And in the Yerushalmi it is mentioned:<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi Shevi’ith, end of Chapter 9.</i> “A certain person who was suspected of [breaking the law of] Seventh-year produce said to his wife, ‘Separate the dough-offering [from the dough].’ Thereupon she said to him, ‘That person [i.e., you] is suspected of breaking the law of Seventh-year produce, and he tells me to separate the dough-offering!’ He said to her, ‘The dough-offering is a matter of Scriptural law; the law of the Seventh-year produce was ordained by the Rabbis, Rabban Gamaliel and his colleagues.’” That unworthy man was suspected of retaining produce of the Seventh year and eating it after the [time of] Removal, and he said that the prohibition of eating <i>tevel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">See above in <i>Seder Emor</i>, Note 108.</i> is a law of the Torah, but the Removal and the prohibition of eating Seventh-year produce after the Removal was ordained by Rabban Gamaliel and his colleagues. Or it may be that [he meant that although] the Removal itself is by law of the Torah, the prohibition of eating from the produce after the [time of] Removal [if one did not fulfill the law of Removal] is by law of the Rabbis — and he was only particular not to eat that which is forbidden by the Torah. Now since the Sages have mentioned the words of this person, it would seem that they are correct [inasmuch as that the prohibition against eating produce after the Removal, was enacted only by the Rabbis, as explained above]. Or perhaps [this is no indication that such is the accepted opinion of the law, because it may be] that this wicked person relied upon the [unaccepted] opinion of Rabbi Shimon<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Moed Katan 2 b. In other words, this was why the Talmud Yerushalmi quoted the words of this man. In our editions of the Gemara, the version is “Rabbi” [the editor of the Mishnah] instead of Rabbi Shimon.</i> who says: “Scripture speaks of two kinds of release [the release of land and the release of money],”<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 15:2: <i>And this is the manner of the ‘release:' every creditor shall ‘release’ that which he hath lent unto his neighbor</i>. The double use of the term “release” indicates that Scripture speaks here of two kinds of release: the release of the land in the Sabbatical year, and the release of monetary debts, and Scripture likens one to another to teach us the following: “At a time the release of the land is in force the release of money is obligatory, but at a time when the release of the land is not in force, the release of money is not obligatory.” And since Rabbi Shimon speaks of “a time when the release of the Land is not obligatory,” he must be referring to the time after the destruction of the Second Temple. (Rashi, Moed Katan 2 b). Thus it is clear that Rabbi Shimon is of the opinion that the law of the Seventh-year produce nowadays is of Rabbinic enactment.</i> and the law of the Seventh-year nowadays is of Rabbinic authority, although the law of removing the dough-offering [in the Land of Israel] is of the Torah.

Verse 8



Verse 9

THEN SHALT THOU MAKE PROCLAMATION WITH THE BLAST OF THE HORN ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH; IN THE DAY OF ATONEMENT SHALL YE MAKE PROCLAMATION WITH THE HORN THROUGHOUT ALL YOUR LAND. “Since Scripture states <i>in the Day of Atonement</i> do I not know that it is <i>on the tenth day of the seventh month?</i> Why then does Scripture state <i>on the tenth day?</i> [It is to teach us that] the blowing [of the <i>Shofar</i>] on the tenth day of the seventh month overrides the Sabbath <i>throughout all your Land</i>, but the blowing [of the <i>Shofar</i>] on the New Year does not override the Sabbath <i>throughout all your Land</i>, but only at the court alone.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>Now the Rabbi [Rashi], with his expert knowledge of the Talmud, and because it is all for him like a ready-laid table, was not concerned when he quoted Beraithoth without qualification, but they are misleading for the rest of the people [who are not as expert in the Talmud as he was]. For it is known and clear in the Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 29 b.</i> that all blowings of the <i>Shofar</i>, whether on the New Year, or the Day of Atonement [in the Jubilee year], or even [blowing] out of one’s own desire [without any intention to fulfill a commandment], are permitted on the Sabbath [by law of the Torah], since blowing [of the <i>Shofar</i>] is merely an art and not “work.” They used [in fact] to blow the <i>Shofar everywhere</i> by law of the Torah on the Sabbath of the New Year and on the Day of Atonement; and the matter of blowing the <i>Shofar</i> [only] at the court, was ordained by Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The title “Rabban” [our master] instead of just “Rabbi,” indicates that he was the head of the Sanhedrin. The title also appears above at the end of Verse 7: “Rabban Gamaliel.” Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai was the leading Sage in the period of the destruction of the Second Temple [in the year 70 Common Era]. It was he who went to Vespasian the Roman general and obtained permission to open an academy at Jabneh, which, after the destruction of the Temple, took the place of the Sanhedrin as the supreme religious authority for the Jewish people. Under his leadership a number of regulations were instituted by the Sages in remembrance of the Temple.</i> after the Temple was destroyed. This was decreed [by Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai], because they [the Sages] prohibited the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> [if the New Year fell on a Sabbath]. Since everyone is obliged to blow the <i>Shofar</i> [or to hear it blown, but not everyone is expert in it, thus we fear that] perhaps he will take the <i>Shofar</i> in his hand and go to an expert to learn, and thus he will carry it the distance of four cubits in a public thoroughfare [which is forbidden by law of the Torah on the Sabbath]; and Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai therefore only permitted us to do it at the court [where the fear of the judges ensures that nobody will violate the Sabbath on account of the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i>]. There is thus no basis whatsoever for this prohibition in Scripture [and so how could Rashi interpret the verse before us on the basis of this Rabbinic enactment]? And the Rabbis, in mentioning that “the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> on the tenth day [of the seventh month] overrides the Sabbath,” intended to say that it is done on every Day of Atonement [in the Jubilee year, whether it falls on a weekday or on the Sabbath]; for there is no difference between overriding the Day of Atonement when it falls on the Sabbath or when it falls on a weekday, since the Day of Atonement itself is like the Sabbath in respect of [the prohibition of] all work, whether that of carrying [an object four cubits in a public thoroughfare, or transferring it from “public” to “private” ground and vice versa], or any other kind of [forbidden] work.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban’s point here is as follows: As far as the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> on the New Year is concerned, there is a clear distinction between a New Year which falls on a weekday and one which occurs on the Sabbath. In the latter case, Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai prohibited blowing the <i>Shofar</i> [except at the court] lest someone may accidentally carry the <i>Shofar</i> and thereby transgress a law of the Torah, as explained in the text. But when the New Year falls on a weekday, there is no question of forbidding blowing the <i>Shofar</i>, because carrying on a festival is permitted. But on the Day of Atonement, unlike other festivals, carrying is prohibited as on the Sabbath. Thus when the Beraitha quoted by Rashi states that the blowing of the Jubilee horn was permitted on the Day of Atonement which fell on the Sabbath, this is equivalent to saying that it is permitted on <i>every</i> Day of Atonement, whether weekday or Sabbath. Hence the thought conveyed by the Beraitha is not as Rashi has it [that the blowing of the Jubilee overrides the Sabbath day], for as the Day of Atonement is concerned everyday of the week is like the Sabbath!</i> Even so, the Rabbi [Rashi] wished to teach us that the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> on the Day of Atonement is to be done in all places, for the meaning of the expression <i>ye shall make proclamation with the horn throughout all your Land</i> is to teach us that each individual is obliged to blow [or hear the sound of] the <i>Shofar</i>, and that the blowing is not done only at the court, as is the counting [of the years].<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 25:8. See Ramban <i>ibid.</i>, 23:15 that this counting is done by the court only.</i>

Verse 10

YOVEIL HI’ (IT IS A JUBILEE). “This [the fiftieth] year is distinguished from all other years by being given a special name. And what is that name? Its name is <i>yoveil</i> [literally: ‘the ram’s horn’] on account of the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i>.” This is Rashi’s language, and such also is the opinion of the commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">R’dak in Sefer Hashorashim (Book of Roots), under the root <i>yoveil</i>.</i> that [the word <i>yoveil</i> here] is of the roots: <i>‘b’keren hayoveil’</i> (<i>with the ram’s horn</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 6:5.</i> <i>‘shofroth ha’yovlim’</i> (<i>the rams’ horns</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> But I do not find this acceptable, because of [the expression here] <i>shall be unto you</i> [<i>it shall be a Jubilee unto you</i>]<i>;</i> for what sense is there in saying of a year that “it shall be ‘a blowing’ unto you”<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">For since Rashi explained that the term <i>yoveil</i> means “blowing the <i>Shofar</i>,” then it follows that <i>‘yoveil hi’ the fiftieth year shall be unto you</i> means that “the fiftieth year shall be blowing the <i>Shofar</i> to you.” But how can this be said of a year? Mizrachi in defense of Rashi writes that Rashi means that “the year in which every man returns to his possession and to his family, is called <i>yoveil</i> (Jubilee) on account of the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i>,” but not that the word <i>yoveil</i> means “blowing.”</i> <i>and you shall return</i> [<i>every man unto his possession</i> etc.]? Perhaps Scripture is stating: “<i>It is a Jubilee</i> distinguishable by that name which I have called it, <i>and it shall be unto</i> all of <i>you</i> known by the blowing of the <i>Shofar</i> which you will do thereon, reminding you of the purport [of the Jubilee year], that in it <i>every man shall return unto his possession, and every man unto his family</i>.” Similarly, <i>A Jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> means that it shall be a Jubilee unto you, that <i>ye shall not sow, neither reap</i>, that is to say, it is known by its name that it is to be so.<br>But all this appears to me to be incorrect. For the meaning of <i>shofroth ha’yovlim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> is “the horns of the rams,” and Yonathan [ben Uziel] also translated there: “<i>shofroth</i> [made] of rams’ horns.” It is also so stated in the Gemara:<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanah 26 a.</i> “What intimation is there that the term <i>yoveil</i> is an expression for a ram? In Arabic they call a ram <i>yovlo</i>.” Now the <i>Shofar</i> used on the Day of Atonement [in the Jubilee year] does not necessarily need to be a ram’s horn, for all <i>shofroth</i> (horns) are valid on it, and in the opinion of our Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26 b.</i> and all the Tannaim (Sages of the Mishnah), the commandment is [preferably to be performed in the year of the Jubilee] with the horn of wild goats. If so, why then would the [Jubilee] year be called “the year of the ram?”<br>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the meaning of <i>yoveil</i> is like “sending forth.” In my opinion, Scripture does not call the year <i>yoveil</i> with reference to the blowing [of the <i>Shofar</i>], but with reference to “the liberty” [that it brings to the inhabitants of the Land]; for this term is not mentioned in the first verse which states, <i>Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of the horn</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 9.</i> But when He stated [in the verse before us] <i>and ye shall proclaim liberty throughout the Land unto all the inhabitants thereof</i>, meaning that they shall all be free to reside wherever they please, He continued by saying <i>‘yoveil hi,’</i> that it is a year in which every man is “carried away” to his possession, and his feet “transport him” to his family <i>afar off to sojourn</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 23:7.</i> This term [<i>yoveil</i>] is used in connection with many subjects. Thus: <i>‘yuval’</i> (<i>there shall be brought</i>) <i>a present unto the Eternal of hosts</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 18:7.</i> and it is further stated: <i>and on ‘yuval’ it spreadeth out its roots;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 17:8.</i> <i>streams and ‘yivlei mayim’</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 30:25.</i> which mean “channels through which water is conveyed.” <i>And the Land shall yield ‘yevulah';</i><sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Further, 26:4.</i> and <i>neither shall ‘yevul’ be in the vines</i><sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Habakkuk 3:17.</i> also signify a kind of “bringing” [of produce or fruits], just as they are called <i>t’vuah</i> [“produce,” which is of the root “bringing”]. Similarly in Aramaic [as will be explained]. Thus: <i>and carry it quickly</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 17:11.</i> the Targum renders: “<i>v’ovil</i> quickly.” Thus the meaning of <i>it shall be ‘yoveil’ unto you</i> is “it is a year which ‘brings’ [liberty] and it shall be so to all of you, that you shall come <i>and return every man unto his possession, and every man unto his family</i>.” And He stated again [in the following verse], <i>A ‘yoveil’ shall that fiftieth year be unto you</i><sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> meaning that the fiftieth year shall be to you only for <i>yoveil</i> [“bringing” liberty], and not for anything else, and <i>ye shall not sow, neither reap</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> but instead it <i>shall be holy</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12.</i> and <i>every man shall return unto his possession</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 13.</i> so that the year shall be for all of you a <i>yoveil</i> [bringing everyone back to his possession and family], as its name indicates.<br>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the term <i>d’ror</i> (liberty) is related to the expression, <i>‘dor’</i> (<i>a generation</i>) <i>passeth away, ‘v’dor’</i> (<i>and a generation</i>) <i>cometh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 1:4. See Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 186, where in his sermon on Ecclesiastes Ramban alludes to a text from the Sefer Habahir which asks: “But does not a generation first ‘come’ and then ‘pass away,’ so why then does the verse change the order? It is to allude to the fact that <i>a generation cometh</i> means that ‘it had already come beforetime.’” See also in Genesis 38:8, Vol. I, p. 469, Note 155.</i> Similarly, <i>yoveil</i> means that everyone will return to the <i>yoveil</i> (source) whence his roots are, and this <i>shall be unto you</i>, [until that time].<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Abusaula.</i>

Verse 11



Verse 12

OUT OF THE FIELD YE SHALL EAT THE INCREASE THEREOF. “By virtue of the produce to be found in the field, you may eat of what is in the house, but if it is no longer to be found by the beast in the field, you must remove it from the house, just as it is said in the case of the Sabbatical year.” This is Rashi’s language. But if so, the verse is not well-connected [to the preceding part].<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding part of the verse reads: <i>For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy unto you</i>. And then it continues: <i>out of the field ye shall eat …</i> Now according to Rashi’s interpretation there is no connection between these two parts of the verse. Instead, the verse is stating etc. Ramban, in other words, is explaining that the end of Verse 12 before us continues from the end of Verse 11 above, as stated in the text.</i> Instead, Scripture is stating: <i>Ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it …</i><sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> <i>For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy unto you</i>, and <i>out of the field ye shall eat the increase thereof</i>, and not out of the house. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted: “<i>out of the field ye shall eat</i>, out of what the field brings forth of its own accord you shall all eat, as is written in the case of the Sabbatical year.”<br>In my opinion Scripture is stating: “<i>You shall not reap nor gather</i> in this year, <i>for it is a Jubilee</i> and <i>it shall be holy unto you; out of the field you shall</i> bring the produce and <i>eat</i>, meaning: that you are to go forth into the field to glean and eat together with the poor and destitute, the beast and cattle, and it is not to be for you a time of reaping and gathering in the produce, and bringing it into your house and store-houses like the produce of all other years.” Now we are taught in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 3:5. See above, Note 129.</i> “From this the Sages have inferred that if one preserves three kinds of vegetables in a single barrel, Rabbi Elazar<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">In Shevi’ith 9:5, and Pesachim 52 a: “Rabbi Eliezer.”</i> says: ‘They may be eaten only as long as the first [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field’ [but as soon as one vegetable is no longer found in the field, all three are forbidden to be eaten, since by preserving them together he makes all three as one]. Rabbi Yehoshua says: ‘Even as long as the last [to ripen of the three kinds] remains in the field’ [they may all be eaten, although the first two vegetables are no longer to be found in the field]. Rabban Gamaliel says: ‘When any one of the species comes to an end in the field, he is to remove that kind from the house’. And the final decision of the law is according to him. Rabbi Shimon says: ‘All vegetables are considered one with regard to the law of Removal.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Thus even though all the vegetables preserved in the barrel no longer remain in the field, as long as other kinds of vegetables are still found in the fields the law of Removal does not apply to those in the barrel [[illegible]] “for all vegetables are considered one with regard to the law of Removal.”</i> All this interpretation is because Scripture does not say “out of the field you shall bring and eat,” but instead [said, <i>out of the field ye shall eat</i>, thus] placing “the eating” next to “the field,” meaning that one may eat [what is stored in the house] only because of it [that which is still to be found in the field]. It is possible that this matter<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the subject of Removal. See Ramban above at the end of Verse 7 in greater detail.</i> is only a Scriptural support for a law of Rabbinic origin, and that is why Rabbi Yehoshua was lenient [even] about it [the actual vegetable], and Rabban Gamaliel [who was more stringent about it than Rabbi Yehoshua, also] was lenient about the taste [of the vegetable which remains in the other vegetables after it is taken out of the barrel]. I have already written on this subject above.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 7.</i> It is possible that according to Rabban Gamaliel the commandment of Removal is by law of the Torah, but the taste of a vegetable, once it is absorbed [by other food] at the beginning [i.e., before the time of the Removal], is considered as if it were “removed” [since it is absorbed and has no independent existence].

Verse 13



Verse 14

YE SHALL NOT WRONG ONE ANOTHER. “This refers to overcharging in money matters.” 15. ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF YEARS AFTER THE JUBILEE THOU SHALT BUY OF THY NEIGHBOR. “The plain meaning of the verse as indicated by its context is that Scripture is admonishing here against overcharging [as mentioned in the preceding verse, and explains here in detail]: When you sell or buy land, ascertain how many years there are left till the Jubilee, and according to these years the vendor is to sell and the purchaser to buy, for in the end the purchaser must return him [the land] in the year of the Jubilee. Thus if there are but a few years [till the Jubilee] and he sells it at a high price, the purchaser has been wronged, and if there are many years so that the purchaser can eat many crops from it, he must buy it according to the [greater] time [remaining till the Jubilee]. It is referring to this that it is said, <i>according to the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> [meaning]: according to the number of years of crops which the land will remain in the hand of the purchaser, you shall sell it to him. Now our Rabbis have derived from here [the law] that one who sells his field has no right to redeem it before two years [after the date of the sale, for the verse states, <i>according to the number of ‘years’ of the crops he shall sell</i>, and the minimum number of the term ‘years’ is two], even if there were three crops in those two years. [However, although this interpretation of the Rabbis indicates that the verse in speaking of <i>shnei</i> means ‘two years’], it does not lose its literal meaning [i.e., ‘years of’], that is to say, he is to sell by the number of ‘years of’ crops, and not by years when the produce is smitten by blast,<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, if during one of the two years after the sale the produce was smitten by blast, the vendor does not have the right to redeem his field until three years have elapsed, so that the purchaser has enjoyed at least two crops.</i> and the minimum number implied in ‘years’ is two.” Thus far is Rashi’s language.<br>Now this is indeed the correct interpretation of the verse; however, our Rabbis have said that overcharge does not apply in [the sale of] land, for it is said:<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 56 b.</i> “<i>Or buy of thy neighbor’s ‘hand’</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14 before us.</i> and this refers to something which is transferred from ‘hand’ to ‘hand’” [i.e., movable goods or chattels]. But this verse according to the Rabbi [Rashi], both in its plain meaning and in its [Rabbinical] interpretation, speaks of [overcharging in the sale of] land! We must then perforce turn the verses away from their simple meaning, and say that each one stands independently [of the others].<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Thus while Rashi interpreted all three verses [14-16] as applying to business transactions, Ramban interprets only Verse 14 in that way, while Verses 15-16 refer only to keeping the laws of the Jubilee, and Verse 17 prohibits all kind of wronging by words. Thus, as Ramban expresses it, “we must perforce turn the verses away from their simple meaning, and say that each one stands independently of the others.”</i> Thus Scripture is stating: <i>And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor’s hand</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 14 before us.</i> that is, something which is transferred from hand to hand, <i>ye shall not wrong one another</i>. Then He states further: “<i>According to the number of years after the Jubilee thou shalt buy</i><sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> of him the crops, <i>and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell</i> them <i>unto thee</i>. According to the years you shall increase and reduce the price,<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">See Verse 16.</i> for you will have to return it [i.e., the land] to him in the Jubilee.” All this is an admonition regarding the Jubilee, that they should keep it forever [but it is not intended as a law against overcharging in the sale of land, for in such a transaction the law of overcharge does not apply]. Then He said further, <i>And ye shall not wrong one another</i>, [referring to wronging] by words [i.e., offending].<br>And it further seems to me logical that one who intentionally overcharges his fellowman, definitely transgresses a negative commandment, whether it be [in a sale of] chattels or land, for it is with reference to them that Scripture is saying, <i>Ye shall not wrong one another. According to the number of years after the Jubilee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 14-15.</i> admonishing that one must buy and sell according to the years [after the Jubilee], and that no man shall wrong another. But our Rabbis laid down a new law regarding overcharge, namely, that [if the amount overcharged was] one-sixth of the total purchase price, [the sale is valid and that extra amount] must be paid back, but the sale is totally invalidated if the amount overcharged was more than one-sixth of the purchase-price. It is only from this law that land has been excluded, since [a person] foregoes an overcharge of even more than a sixth [of the purchase price] in the case of [the sale of land], just as one [is prepared to] forego in the case of chattels an overcharge of less than a sixth [of the purchase-price], although it is forbidden to overcharge intentionally by such [amounts], but people do not usually go back on their purchase on account of such a small overcharging. The Sages interpreted [Scripture to give a basis for this law] because the verse states, <i>And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy</i> something which is transferred from hand to hand, <i>ye shall not wrong one another</i>. From this we learn that in the matter of overcharging there is a special law for chattels which does not apply to land, namely, the return of the money, [i.e., the cancellation of the entire sale if the amount overcharged was more than a sixth of the purchase price], but the negative commandment [forbidding overcharging] applies to all transactions. That is why He said, <i>‘v’chi thim’kru mimkar’</i> [“if ‘ye’ sell aught”], which is a plural expression, referring to one who sells land and to one who sells chattels; <i>‘o kanoh’</i> (<i>or buys</i>) <i>of thy neighbor’s hand</i>, referring to an individual, who sells chattels from hand to hand, and with reference to all of them He said <i>ye shall not wrong</i>. But since He singled out and specified chattels, [it indicates that] He gave concerning them an additional law regarding overcharging, namely the [right to] return the money [of the purchase-price and thereby cancel the sale]. This is a correct interpretation according to the expositions which our Rabbis have received on the allusions of the Torah.<br>Perhaps all this is only a Scriptural support [for a Rabbinical enactment], for the negative commandment [<i>ye shall not wrong one another</i>] constitutes an admonition applying to both land and chattels [but does not refer at all to cancellation of the entire purchase], and [the right to return] the money the Rabbis received by tradition as applying to chattels and not to [transactions of] land, just as they have said<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Kamma 14 b. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 177, Note 96.</i> that [land] is a possession that is worth any price. For all these [differing] standards of one-sixth [of the purchase-price, in which case the sale is valid and the amount overcharged must be returned], and more than one-sixth [in which case the entire sale may be cancelled] are based on people’s opinions [and since “land is worth any price” to most people, the Rabbis did not institute these laws of overcharging with respect to land]. And why should the Rabbis not exclude [transactions of] land from this law [of overcharging] just as they excluded from it wares bought from a householder? Thus they said:<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 51 a.</i> “[The law of overcharging] is taught only if one buys from a merchant, but if one buys from a private householder, the law of overcharging does not apply,” because private people are not in the habit of selling the possessions that they use [and hence if they do sell them, it is considered as if they had made a specific condition that the buyer cannot complain about the price].<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi <i>ibid.</i>, in the name of the <i>She’iltoth</i> of Rav Achai Gaon.</i><br>It is also possible to say that Scripture is warning that they [sellers and purchasers] should take cognizance of the number of years till the Jubilee, and according to them they should sell and buy, and no one should wrong another because of them by misleading him about the number [of years], or by deceiving him about the sale, so that he thinks that it is in perpetuity, and thus he leads him astray thereby. Instead, they must both know and inform one another of this number, since the sale is according to the number of years [remaining] until the Jubilee, for even in [transactions of] land the law of overcharging applies as regards size and number,<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it is only with reference to price that specific laws of overcharging do not apply to land, but not with reference to size or number.</i> even if the misleading referred to was less than one-sixth [of the size or the number], and all the more so in the case of chattels [one must be careful not to overcharge].

Verse 18

AND YE SHALL DO MY STATUTES, AND KEEP MINE ORDINANCES. He warned [here] concerning [all] the statutes on account of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee mentioned [above], because these [commandments] are in the category of “statutes” [for which no explicit reason is given], and [He warned concerning all] the ordinances on account of the law of the return of sales and servants in the Jubilee, and [the law of] overcharging [which are “ordinances” for which the reasons are obvious]. He said, <i>and ye shall dwell in the Land in safety</i>, because it is for the sin of [transgressing the laws of] the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee that Israel goes into exile. He then said again, <i>And the Land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat until ye have enough, and dwell therein in safety</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 19.</i> meaning that you will not have to go out of the Land in the Sabbatical year in order to live in another land on account of lack of food [because <i>the Land shall yield</i> enough <i>fruit</i>].

Verse 19



Verse 20

AND IF YE SHALL SAY: ‘WHAT SHALL WE EAT THE SEVENTH YEAR?’ The verse is, as it were, inverted, meaning: “and if you shall say in the seventh year, ‘What shall we eat [in the eighth year]?’ for their worry would be about the eighth year. For since the beginning of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee is in Tishri, then they would eat of the produce of the sixth year during the seventh year, as is the normal way in all other years to eat [of the old produce] until after the reaping [of the new], which is at the time of the Festival of Weeks, and even afterwards until the work of fanning and sifting the produce is finished. Therefore the correct interpretation of the verse, <i>and it shall bring forth produce for the three years</i><sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> is that on account of the year of Jubilee [which always follows a Sabbatical year, G-d will command His blessing <i>in the sixth year</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> meaning] that the sixth year will bring forth [sufficient produce] for the whole of the Sabbatical year, the Jubilee and the year after the Jubilee, and during all these [three years] they will eat of the old crop. Thus Scripture is assuring them that should they fear in the seventh year saying, “What shall we eat?” <i>then I will command My blessing in the sixth year</i> that it shall bring forth produce <i>for the three years</i> following after [the sixth year], this being an additional blessing [to that of every Sabbatical year, when the sixth year brings forth sufficient produce for the seventh and eighth years; and when in addition there is a Jubilee year, it will bring forth enough for three years] so that it should suffice also for the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee. He states, <i>And ye shall sow the eighth year</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> meaning to say that you should sow in the eighth year in the customary manner of every year, and you should not hurry to plow and sow, or to reap, for <i>until her produce come in</i> into the house at the time that the harvest [usually] takes place every year, at the Festival of Tabernacles, <i>ye shall eat the old crop</i>. And in the Torath Kohanim [it is stated]:<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 4:6.</i> “<i>For the three years</i><sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> — for the sixth, the seventh, and the year after the seventh. Another interpretation: <i>For the three years</i> — for the Seventh year, the Jubilee, and the year after the Jubilee.”

Verse 23

AND THE LAND SHALL NOT BE SOLD IN PERPETUITY. “This is to declare a negative commandment affecting [one who refuses] to return fields to their [original] owners in the Jubilee, so that the purchaser should not retain it.” This is Rashi’s language. But if so, why does He warn about “selling” [saying, <i>the Land shall not be ‘sold’ in perpetuity</i>], when it should rather have said: “Thou shalt not <i>buy</i> in perpetuity”? Perhaps [the meaning of the verse is as if] it said, “<i>and the Land shall not be sold</i> to you <i>in perpetuity</i>” [and thus the prohibition refers to the buyer]. Similarly, <i>they shall not be sold as bondmen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 42.</i> is an admonition to the purchaser, that he must send forth to freedom [a Hebrew servant] in the Jubilee year, according to the plain meaning of the verse.<br>It is, [however], possible that <i>the Land shall not be sold in perpetuity</i> is a negative commandment referring to the seller, that he is not to sell it permanently by saying: “I am selling it to you forever, even for after the Jubilee.” For although the Jubilee [in fact] takes it out of his possession [despite his intention of buying it permanently], Scripture nonetheless admonishes the seller or both of them that they should not [attempt to] make their transaction in perpetuity, and if they did so stipulate, they transgress this negative commandment, and [additionally] it will be of no avail to them, for the land <i>will</i> return in the Jubilee. And so did Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] explain it.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, <i>Hilchoth Shmitah V’yoveil</i> 11:1.</i> And the reason for this prohibition [of stipulating a permanent sale, although such a stipulation is completely ineffective], is because it is well-known in human thought that if people take into account from the beginning of the transaction the number of years until the Jubilee, it will [in the end] be easier for them [i.e., for the purchasers, to return it in the Jubilee], but if one [intends to] buy it in perpetuity, one will find it very difficult to return. This prohibition, then, is similar to what the Sages have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Temurah 4 b.</i> “That which the Merciful One said one may not do, if one does do, has no legal effect, but the transgressor is liable to the punishment of whipping because he violated the Royal decree.”<br>The correct opinion appears to me to be that this is not a negative commandment [for the transgression of which] one is liable to whipping. Rather, [the verse merely states] a reason [for the Jubilee], saying: “Observe between you [the law of] the Jubilee, and be not resentful about it, <i>for the Land is Mine</i>, and I do not want that it should be sold in perpetuity as [in the case of] other transactions.” This is the meaning [of the Rabbis’ interpretation] in the Torath Kohanim:<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 4:8.</i> “<i>And the Land shall not be sold ‘litzmithuth’</i> — permanently. <i>For the Land is Mine</i> — [therefore] be not resentful about it. <i>For ye are strangers and settlers</i> — do not consider yourselves the main [proprietors]. <i>Ye are with Me</i> — it is enough for the servant to be as his Master. When it is Mine it is yours.”<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">This is a euphemism, the intent of which is as follows: “When you [Israel] are there upon the Land, G-d considers it as His, since the laws of the Jubilee then apply, but this is not so when Israel is exiled.” See my Hebrew commentary p. 179.</i><br>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the meaning of the expression <i>for the Land is Mine</i> [literally: “for ‘unto Me’ is the Land”] is like <i>and they take ‘unto Me’ an offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 25:2.</i> It is this which the Rabbis have alluded to here [by saying in the Torath Kohanim]:<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 4:8.</i> “It is enough for the servant to be as his Master,” for the Jubilee will be applying [even]<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Abusaula. See further in Vol. II, p. 341, Note 23.</i> in the world. The person learned [in the mysteries of the Cabala] will understand.

Verse 24

AND IN ALL THE LAND OF YOUR POSSESSION [YE SHALL GRANT A REDEMPTION FOR THE LAND]. “This [expression of ‘in all the land’] includes houses and Hebrew servants [that they too be granted the right of redemption]. This matter is explained in the first chapter of Tractate Kiddushin.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin 21 a.</i> And according to the plain meaning thereof, it is to be connected with the section [immediately] following, [thus teaching] that he who sells [his land] has the right of redeeming it after two years, either personally or through his relative, and the purchaser cannot prevent it.” This is Rashi’s language. But it does not appear to me to be correct that Scripture should state in general terms in the section dealing with the Jubilee, [mentioned above], <i>And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption</i> [which according to Rashi speaks of the right of the seller to redeem the land of his possession], and then explain in the second section how this law applies: <i>If thy brother be waxen poor</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 25. In other words, since this verse [25] begins a new section in the Torah, and is thereby disconnected from the preceding verse [before us], it is not likely that this new section is the explanation of the preceding verse.</i><br>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that Scripture is stating: “<i>And in all the land of your possession</i>, that is, the land which I give you for a possession, <i>ye shall grant</i> this <i>redemption</i> of the Jubilee.” The term “redemption” is like <i>the Eternal hath redeemed His servant Jacob</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 48:20.</i> which means that He brought out His servant from the hand of those who held him [captive]. Similarly, <i>and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm</i><sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 6:6.</i> [means “I will take Israel out of Egypt”]. So also [the expression before us] <i>ye shall grant a redemption for the Land</i> means that I wish to redeem My Land from the hand of those who hold it, as I have not given it to them as a part of their possession. It was necessary that this be stated because He had said [as a reason for this law], <i>for ‘ha’aretz’</i> (<i>the earth</i>) <i>is Mine</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 23. It is clear from the following text that Ramban understands here the word <i>ha’aretz</i> as referring to the entire earth, and not to any particular land.</i> and since the whole earth is His, therefore He stated additionally that the Jubilee only applies in the Land of our possession, not outside the Land [of Israel]. He stated <i>and in all</i> [<i>‘and in all’ the land of your possession …</i>] meaning that it is to apply to all our possessions, including the other side of the Jordan and all places of [our] possession, and not only in “the Land of the Eternal” wherein the Sanctuary is located [i.e., westward of the Jordan, but the law of the Jubilee is to apply also in the land east of the Jordan where the Sanctuary of G-d may not be built — see Ramban Numbers 21:21].

Verse 29

AND IF A MAN SELL A DWELLING-HOUSE IN A WALLED CITY. Since a man finds it very difficult to sell his house, and be disconcerted at the time of the sale, therefore the Torah wanted that he [have the right to] redeem it within the first year [after the sale]. And because man is <i>servant to the field</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 5:8.</i> and the bread of his sustenance comes from it, the Torah wanted [that if the seller did not redeem it before the Jubilee], it should go back [to him] in the <i>Jubilee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> But with regard to a house [in a walled city], after [the seller] has given up hope [of regaining it], by changing his residence and staying for a year in another house, it can no longer cause him harm [if he cannot redeem it after a year], since his [source of] livelihood will not be diminished if it will be forfeited [to the purchaser]. <i>And the houses of the villages</i> [<i>which have no wall round about them</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> are made for the purpose of protecting the fields, and to serve as dwelling-places for those who cultivate the earth; therefore their law [of redemption] is similar to that of <i>the fields of the country</i> [i.e., they may be redeemed at any time until the Jubilee, and in the Jubilee they go back without compensation].

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

AND IF ONE OF THE LEVITES REDEEM. The plain meaning of this verse appears to be as follows: He had stated [in the previous verse], <i>the Levites have a perpetual right of redemption</i>, to redeem immediately [even before the period of two years after the sale of the fields, which an Israelite must wait before he is allowed to redeem], and to redeem at any time [a house in a walled city, even after the expiration of a year since the sale, after which time an Israelite cannot redeem]. But He did not explain with reference to them [the Levites] whether their relatives [also] have the right of redemption, nor whether the Jubilee applies to them. Therefore He stated again, <i>And if one of the Levites redeem</i>, be the redeemer the seller himself or his relative a Levite, <i>then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the Jubilee</i> from the hand of the purchaser. He should redeem it on this understanding, that <i>he shall reckon the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 27. He calculates how many years remain until the Jubilee, and divides the total purchase-price by the number of years of crops that the purchaser will have until the Jubilee. This gives the value of each crop bought. If the purchaser or his relative redeems the field before the Jubilee, he deducts from the purchase-money paid the value of the crops eaten by the purchaser during the years that the field was in his possession, and gives him the balance.</i> meaning to say that the Jubilee does apply to them [the Levites], and the manner of their redemption shall be as He said of the Israelites, <i>and he shall reckon the years of the sale thereof</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 27. He calculates how many years remain until the Jubilee, and divides the total purchase-price by the number of years of crops that the purchaser will have until the Jubilee. This gives the value of each crop bought. If the purchaser or his relative redeems the field before the Jubilee, he deducts from the purchase-money paid the value of the crops eaten by the purchaser during the years that the field was in his possession, and gives him the balance.</i><br>And our Rabbis have said<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Arakhin 33 a.</i> that the verse speaks of a Levite who buys from a Levite. According to their word, the interpretation of the verse appears to me to be as follows: It was the custom in former times in Israel that when a man had to sell his field, the person who had precedence in his inheritance [i.e., who was the nearest relative who could inherit] would come and buy it, and it was this that was called “redemption,” as it is said, <i>Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is thine to buy it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 32:7.</i> and so also is it explained there in the matter of Boaz.<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth 4:4.</i> And it appears to me that they administered a law of precedence for him, just as our Rabbis enacted for us the law of [the prerogative of] the neighbor,<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 108 a. If a man wishes to sell his field, his neighbor has the special right of pre-emption — the right of purchasing before or in preference to others.</i> and [if other people wanted to buy it], they would acquire [the right of possession] from the “first redeemer” by the [symbolic act of] acquisition of a scarf, as did Boaz.<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth 4:8: <i>So the near kinsman said unto Boaz: ‘Buy it for thyself.’ And he drew off his shoe</i>. See Ramban on Exodus 28:41.</i> Thus Scripture is stating here that when a Levite redeems the inheritance of a Levite, that is to say, when he buys it from him as is the law of redemption, then that [land] acquired shall go out in the Jubilee. It thus teaches that the Jubilee applies to them [the Levites] in the case of “redemption” just as in the case of any other sale [among Israelites]. Scripture did not have to mention this law in the case of a plain sale [i.e., to say that if a Levite sold his field to a non-Levite, who is not his near relative, that it goes back to its original owner, the Levite, in the Jubilee], for they [Levites] are part of all Israel [and it is self-understood that the same laws apply to them]; except that He strengthened their legal right [by giving them, as explained above], a perpetual [privilege of] redemption. This law of “redemption” applies also to Israelites [i.e., that if they bought from Levites, the Levites have an unrestricted right of redemption forever]. Scripture, however, mentioned it with reference to the Levites, in order that one should not say that the [forty-eight] cities<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 35:6-7.</i> were only given to the whole tribe of Levi [and not to any particular person], and that therefore [fields which a Levite had sold] go back from an Israelite [in the Jubilee, i.e., if the purchaser was an Israelite he must give them back], but they do not go back from a Levite [i.e., if the purchaser was a Levite he does not have to give them back, since they remain anyway in the hands of the Levitical tribe], and certainly [we might think that] from a near kinsman [i.e., a Levite] whom we have made liable to buy [the field of his poor brother-Levite, those fields surely do not go back in the Jubilee]; therefore He said that this <i>redemption</i> too goes back in the Jubilee, and from the [law stated in connection with the] Levite we deduce [that the same law applies] to the Israelites. It is possible also that the Levites are not permitted to sell of their cities in any transaction [i.e., whether a field or house] to an Israelite, and therefore all their purchases are termed <i>redemption</i> [because only other Levites, who are their kinsmen, can buy from them].

Verse 35

THAT HE MAY LIVE WITH THEE. The meaning thereof is that he [i.e., the stranger or settler]<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">See Note 33 in my Hebrew Commentary pp. 180-181, that this is the correct interpretation of the intent of Ramban. Thus the expression before us speaks of our duty to help the stranger and settler, “and surely [this duty applies to] one of our brethren of the children of Israel, who had become poor.” It is from this positive commandment <i>that he may live with thee</i> that we derive the principle that the saving of life overrides the Sabbath etc., as Ramban continues.</i> shall [be enabled to] live with you, it being a positive commandment to support him, and it is from here [that we deduce] that we are commanded by means of a positive commandment to save life. It is from here too, that the Sages have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 5:3. Baba Metzia 62 a.</i> “<i>That thy brother may live with thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 36.</i> This was explained by Ben Peturi: If two people were going on a journey [in the desert], and one of them has a pitcher of water which [contains such an amount that] if he [alone] drinks it, [it would suffice to enable him to] reach an inhabited place, but if both drink from it, both would die. Ben Peturi stated: ‘It is better that both should drink and die, rather than that one should witness the death of his colleague,’ until Rabbi Akiba came and taught: <i>that thy brother may live with thee</i><sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 36.</i> — thy life takes precedence over the life of thy colleague.”<br>He repeated [the phrase] <i>that thy brother may live with thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 36.</i> in order to emphasize and stress [that we are not to take from him any interest or increase, as is stated in the first part of that verse]. And the Rabbinical interpretation is as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 62 a.</i> “Return to him the interest, so that he may live with you.” Thus He commanded the return of [previously] stipulated interest, similar to that which He said in the case of robbery, <i>and he shall restore that which he took by robbery</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 5:23. Interest is only forbidden by law of the Torah if it is previously stipulated, i.e., at the time of the loan, although the Rabbis forbade all interest.</i><br>Now Onkelos rendered <i>‘geir v’thoshav vachai imach’</i> [generally translated: <i>a stranger and a settler that he may live with thee</i>] as part of the positive commandments [enumerated here, thus meaning:] “he shall sojourn and settle and live with you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">The sense of the verse according to Onkelos is thus as follows: <i>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and his means fail with thee — then thou shalt uphold him</i>. And the verse continues to explain how you are to uphold him: “he is to sojourn and settle and live with thee.” But according to the Rabbis, as Ramban continues, the sense of the verse is etc.</i> But according to the opinion of our Rabbis in the Gemara,<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Metzia 71a. See my Hebrew Commentary p. 181.</i> the sense of the verse is as follows: [“<i>And if thy brother be waxen poor …</i>] <i>then thou shalt uphold him</i>, and [thou shalt also uphold] <i>a stranger and a settler</i>, so that each one of them <i>shall live with thee</i>.”

Verse 36

TAKE THOU NO ‘NESHECH’ (INTEREST) OF HIM OR ‘RIBITH’ (INCREASE). “The Rabbis explained [these two terms — ‘interest’ and ‘increase’] as one, and [the reason why Scripture mentioned two different words is to teach us that he who transgresses this law] violates two negative commandments.” This is Rashi’s language. The plain meaning of the verse appears to me to be that <i>neshech</i> (interest) is where, [for example], he lends him a hundred [shekels] and [the borrower is] to give him five shekels each year [for the use of the money, without deducting it from the capital sum of the loan]. It is so called [<i>neshech</i>, literally “biting”] because <i>at the last ‘yishach’</i> (<i>it biteth</i>) <i>like a snake</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 23:32.</i> [the effect of whose bite is not noticed immediately, but which] spurts and increases. <i>Tarbith</i> [or <i>ribith</i> — “increase”], however, is if he lends him [a sum of money] until a certain time, and then [the borrower is to] repay him and give him an increase of five shekels, but [even if the repayment should be delayed], there is no [additional] increase after that time [i.e., there is one fixed sum and not an annual percentage]; this [form of interest] does not “bite”, since it will not go up more than that [fixed] sum, but it is [nonetheless] “an increase.” Therefore He stated, <i>Thou shalt not give him thy money ‘b’neshech’</i> (<i>upon interest</i>), <i>nor give him thy food ‘b’marbith’</i> (<i>for increase</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 37.</i> for it is customary to lend money for <i>neshech</i> (interest), [the borrower being obliged] to give every year [a certain amount of money for the use of the capital borrowed], but food is [usually] lent until the time of reaping, and then he pays him back out of his granary with a stipulated addition.

The meaning of this is that he [your brother who sold himself to you] shall not be with you in your house as a bondservant, but <i>as a laborer hired year by year</i><sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 53.</i> who hires himself out to do work as a freeman, and who is not subjected to heavy work; or [he is to be in your house] <i>as a settler</i>, for it is customary that settlers who come to sojourn in [another] land work for the head of the household with whom they reside to their satisfaction, similar to the case of Jacob with Laban, where [Laban] said [to Jacob], <i>Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 29:15.</i> And in the Torath Kohanim it is written:<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 7:3.</i> “<i>As a hired servant</i> — just as [in the case of] a hired servant <i>in the same day thou shalt give him his hire</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 24:15.</i> so too, this one must be given his hire in the same day.<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">If he did some extra work outside his strict duty, his master must pay him on the day he completes it (Malbim in his commentary to the Torath Kohanim <i>ibid.</i>).</i> <i>As a settler</i> — just as [in the case of] a settler <i>he shall dwell with thee … where it liketh him best; thou shalt not wrong him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 23:17.</i> this one also <i>where it liketh him best; thou shalt not wrong him. — He shall be with thee</i>, with thee concerning [the same kind of] food, with thee concerning [the same kind of] drink, with thee concerning [the same kind of] clean garment, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">“So that you [the master] should not eat bread of refined flour, and he eat black bread; you drink old wine, and he drink new wine; you sleep on pillows, and he sleep on straw” (Torath Kohanim <i>ibid.</i>).</i>

AND IF A STRANGER WHO IS A SETTLER WITH THEE BE WAXEN RICH, AND THY BROTHER BE WAXEN POOR BESIDE HIM, AND SELL HIMSELF UNTO THE STRANGER WHO IS A SETTLER WITH THEE, OR ‘L’EIKER’ (TO THE STOCK OF) THE FAMILY OF ‘GEIR’ (A STRANGER). “<i>The family of ‘geir’</i> — this means an idolater. Since Scripture [also] stated <i>l’eiker</i> (‘to the stock of’ the idolater), it refers to one who sold himself to the idol itself — to be its servant; not to worship it as a deity, but to hew wood and draw water for its service.” This is Rashi’s language derived from the Torath Kohanim.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Behar</i> 5:1.</i> And if so, the verse is saying: <i>l’eiker ‘u’mishpachath geir</i> [“to the stock of ‘and’ to the family of the stranger,” — since according to Rashi the verse speaks of two different people — and omits the conjunctive “and” and merely says, <i>l’eiker mishpachath geir</i> — literally “to the stock of the family of a stranger”]. Scripture calls the idol <i>eiker</i> [“plucking” or “uprooting”] because a person is dutybound to uproot thoroughly an object of idol-worship and to extirpate it.<br>But Onkelos translated <i>l’eiker</i> — <i>l’armai</i> (“to a gentile”), and this is the correct interpretation. Scripture is thus mentioning [the case of a Hebrew who] sold himself to a stranger who dwells with us, or who sold himself <i>‘l’eiker mishpachath geir’</i> (<i>to the stock of the stranger’s family</i>), who is himself a gentile, the word <i>eiker</i> thus being related to the expression <i>‘ikar sharshohi’</i> (<i>the stump of its roots</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 4:12.</i> Scripture states <i>‘mishpachath geir’</i> (<i>the family of the stranger</i>) [in order to indicate that] the stranger or the settler who became rich with us brought it about that the brother [i.e., the Israelite] become poor beside him [because he had emulated his ways] and thus be sold to the stock of the family of the stranger. Scripture commanded that he must be redeemed,<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 48.</i> this being a positive commandment upon all Israel that we are to redeem him, and then it commanded his kinsmen that they are the first [in this duty].<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 49.</i> The purpose of the commandment is clear, that he should not become assimilated and learn from the ways [of his purchasers]. For in the case of [all] other sales, the redemption by kinsmen is a matter of choice [but here it is an obligation]. Therefore He said here, <i>For unto Me the children of Israel are servants; they are My servants</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 55.</i> meaning to say that “although the stranger who settled [with us] and the stock of his family do not have to observe the commandment of the Jubilee, they cannot buy My servants to be their [permanent] servants.”

Chapter 26



Verse 1

YE SHALL MAKE YOU NO IDOLS. “Scripture is speaking with reference to this person [mentioned above] who sold himself to an idolater, that he should not say, ‘Since my master worships idols, I will also worship them; Since my master is immoral, I too will be dissolute; since my master does not observe the Sabbath, I will also profane the Sabbath.’ Scripture therefore states, <i>Ye shall make you no idols … Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My Sanctuary</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 1-2.</i> Thus Scripture warned concerning [the observance of] the commandments.” This is the language of the Torath Kohanim,<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, end of <i>Behar</i>.</i> and the interpretation [thereof is as follows]: Scripture warned the servant who sold himself to an idolater to be heedful of the commandments concerning idolatry and the Sabbath, — as well as the reverence due to the Sanctuary, which he should come to on the festivals and treat with awe,<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 29-31.</i> and the same warning applies with regard to all the commandments. However, He mentioned only these commandments as they are the main ones, and they indicate [that the same principle applies] to all of them. Now some texts of the Torath Kohanim have this reading: “Scripture ‘mentioned here’ [the commandments,” instead of “Thus Scripture warned,” as stated above]. If this is the correct text, then the Rabbis [of the Torath Kohanim] alluded to [the concept] that all the commandments are included in the Sabbath and the Sanctuary. The person learned [in the mysteries of the Cabala] will understand.<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above in <i>Seder Kedoshim</i> 19:30.</i><br>Bechukothai

Verse 4

THEN WILL I GIVE YOUR RAINS IN THEIR SEASON. He mentioned the matter of rains first [of all the blessings] because if they come in their proper season, the air is pure and good and the springs and rivers are good [clear], and thus it [the rain] is a [prime] cause of physical health, and all produce will increase and be blessed by it, just as He said, <i>and the Land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 4 before us.</i> Thus because of this [pure state of the environment] people do not become sick, and <i>none shall miscarry, nor be barren</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:26.</i> even among their cattle,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 7:14.</i> and they will live out [the full extent of] their days.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See II Samuel 7:12.</i> For when the material frame [of human beings] is large and healthy, they can continue [in health] as in the days of Adam.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years (Genesis 5:5).

Verse 5



Verse 6

AND I WILL GIVE PEACE IN THE LAND — So that there will be peace among you, and no man shall fight against his brother,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 19:2.</i> or “peace” may mean that <i>He will cause evil beasts to cease out of the Land</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in Verse 6 before us. In other words, it may be that the expression, <i>And I will give peace in the Land</i> is a completely independent thought, and what follows in the verse is another series of blessings, or it is possible that the second half of the verse explains the first half.</i> <i>Neither shall the sword go through your Land</i> at all, but you will pursue your enemies,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Verse 7.</i> going forth against them in battle, and they will flee. And [the meaning of the verse] by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], is that He will give peace which will cleave to the [higher]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ricanti.</i> “earth,” which is the all-inclusive peace which is equal to everything.
AND I WILL CAUSE EVIL BEASTS TO CEASE OUT OF THE LAND. According to Rabbi Yehudah who said<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Bechukothai</i> 2:1.</i> that He will remove them from the world [entirely, the verse] is [to be understood] in its plain sense — that evil beasts will not come into their Land. For since there will be plentitude and an abundance of blessings, and the cities will be full of people, [wild] beasts will not come into inhabited places. And according to Rabbi Shimon who says that He will cause them to cease from causing harm, the verse is stating: “and I will cause the evil of the beasts to cease out of the Land.” This is the correct interpretation for when [Israel] observes the commandments, the Land of Israel will be like the world was at its beginning, before the sin of the first man, when no wild beast or creeping thing would kill a man, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Berachoth 33 a.</i> “It is not the wild ass that kills, but it is sin that kills.” It is [because of] this that Scripture says, <i>and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 11:8.</i> and similarly, <i>and the cow and the bear shall feed … and the lion shall eat straw like the ox</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7.</i> For dangerous beasts only prey [on human beings] on account of the sin of man, because of which it was decreed upon him that he be <i>a prey to their teeth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 124:6. See in Genesis 9:5 (Vol. I, pp. 134-135) where Ramban also discusses this theme.</i> and preying was made a part of their nature so that they also prey on each other, as is well-known for having once preyed on man, they add [to this tendency that of preying on animals] so that they become more harmful. And so Scripture states, <i>And he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 19:3.</i> Now at the time of the creation of the world, it is said of the beasts that He gave them the herb for food, as it is written, <i>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is a living soul, I have given every green herb for food</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:30.</i> and Scripture states, <i>and it was so</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:30.</i> meaning that such was the nature with which they were endowed forever. It was [only] afterwards that they learned how to prey, on account of [human] sin which causes death, as I have explained. Now when slaughtering animals [for food] became permitted for the sons of Noah after the flood,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>ibid.</i>, Vol. I, p. 57 for the reason for this permission.</i> He warned with reference to humans [that shedding their blood was forbidden saying], <i>And surely your blood of your lives will I require … the life of man</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:5.</i> but not the blood of one beast from the hand of another, for they were left to prey [on each other and on man] as was their wont. But the beasts of the Land of Israel, when [man will be] in a state of perfection, will cease from their harmful way, and revert to their original nature with which they were endowed at the time of their creation. I have already referred to a part of this in <i>Seder Eileh Toldoth Noach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:5.</i> Therefore Scripture stated concerning the time of the redeemer who is descended of the stock of Jesse, that peace will return to the world and preying and all dangerous beasts will cease, as was their nature at first. The [original] intention [when referring to the redeemer was in connection with] Hezekiah [king of Judah], whom the Holy One, blessed be He, had wished to make the Messiah,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 94 a.</i> but their merits [i.e., those of the people of his generation] were not sufficient for such [achievement], so that the fulfillment [of that prophecy] will be with reference to the Messiah who is destined to come.

Verse 8

AND YOUR ENEMIES SHALL FALL BEFORE YOU BY THE SWORD. He assured them at first that they would chase their enemies and that they would fall by their sword,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Verse 7.</i> and then He stated again by way of repetition [in the verse before us], <i>and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword</i>, in order to give them fortitude of heart and strength so that five [of them would not be afraid] to pursue a hundred. He [furthermore promised that He] would put faintness into the heart of their enemies, so that a hundred would [in fact] flee before five, and would all fall by the sword of the five, for it would be possible that they [a hundred people] would flee because of the sword and because of their fear, but that they would not be able to kill them by the sword because of their few numbers [therefore He mentioned specifically that they would be able to put them to the sword too]. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has said that this repetition [in our verse] means that they [the enemies] will fall continually, time after time, without regaining [their strength].

AND I WILL MAKE YOU FRUITFUL. This means that they will all have children, fruit of the womb, and there will be no barren man or woman among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Deuteronomy 7:14.</i> And then He stated again, <i>and I will multiply you</i>, meaning that they will have many children, and will not be bereaved of them, because they will live out their days,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See II Samuel 7:12.</i> and therefore they will be a large people.

Verse 10



Verse 11

AND I WILL SET MY TABERNACLE AMONG YOU. “This means the Sanctuary [at Jerusalem].” AND MY SOUL SHALL NOT ‘THIG’AL’ (ABHOR) YOU. “This means that My spirit shall not reject you. Every [form of the term] <i>ge’ilah</i> is an expression of spewing out something that has been absorbed in another substance, such as: <i>for there ‘nig’al’ the shield of the mighty</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 1:21. The reference is to King Saul and Jonathan who fell in battle with the Philistines, and David in his eulogy mentions that their shields were of no avail to them, as Ramban explains.</i> meaning that the shield was not receptive to the oil with which it was anointed; for they used to anoint a leather shield with boiled [fat], in order to make the blows of arrows or spears glance off it, so that it should not pierce the leather.” This is Rashi’s language.<br>But I do not know what would be the meaning of this, that the Holy One, blessed be He, should say that if we keep all the commandments and do His will, He will not reject us and His soul will not abhor us! Similarly when [speaking of] our transgressing His covenant [with us], and committing <i>great provocations</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 9:18.</i> He said, <i>I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 44.</i> And the prophet [Jeremiah] said at the time of cursing [i.e., the prediction of the destruction of the First Sanctuary], <i>Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Hast Thy soul loathed Zion?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 14:19.</i> But this subject is one of the secrets of the mysteries of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The allusion is to the transmigration of the soul (Bei’ur Ha’lvush to Ricanti, and so also clearly in Rabbeinu Bachya’s commentary to the Torah (Vol. II, p. 575 in my edition).</i> Scripture is thus stating that He will set His Tabernacle among us, and that “the soul”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Here referring to a term which in the Cabalistic sense signifies the very source in one of the Divine Emanations from which the human soul originates (Abusaula).</i> from which the Tabernacle<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Divine soul within us.</i> comes, will not spew us forth as a pot which we scour in hot water [in order to cleanse it of substances it has absorbed], but instead our <i>garments will always be white</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 9:8. — Ramban is thus intimating that human life will be so perfect when we observe the commandments, that man will achieve his goal in one lifetime, and his soul will not be rejected on its return to its original heavenly abode.</i> and new. For the term <i>ge’ilah</i> denotes, as Rashi said, “casting out,” related to the expression, <i>his bull gendereth and doth not ‘yag’il’</i> (<i>allow the cow to reject as loathsome</i>), <i>his cow calveth, and casteth not her calf</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Job 21:10.</i> He states here <i>My soul</i> [<i>and ‘My soul’ shall not abhor you</i>] similar to the expression, <i>the Eternal G-d hath sworn by His soul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 6:8.</i> And the prophet [Jeremiah] thus is saying by way of amazement: “<i>Hast Thou loathed Zion</i>, itself<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 14:19.</i> which is <i>a city and a mother in Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 20:19.</i> and hast Thou cast her from before thee, so that all her sons are <i>clothed with filthy garments</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Zechariah 3:3.</i> polluted [with sin]?”<br>Now according to their simple sense, these blessings, which are many and [stated in] general terms [affecting the people as a whole], — such as rain, plenitude, peace and the fruitfulness of people — are unlike the blessings with which He has already blessed [the people] in brief, saying, <i>And He will bless thy bread, and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:25.</i> For there He assured them that their food and drink would be [a source of] blessing, so that no sickness will occur to our bodies, and therefore the organs of procreation will be complete and healthy and we will give birth properly, and live full lives, as He said, <i>None shall miscarry, nor be barren in thy Land, the number of thy days will I fulfill</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 26.</i> and similarly He said at the beginning, <i>for I am the Eternal that healeth thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 15:26.</i> The reason for this [division of the blessings into two sections] is that [all] the blessings [mentioned in the Torah], although they are miraculous, are hidden miracles of which the whole Torah is full, as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See in Genesis 17:1 (Vol. I, pp. 215-216), and 46:15 (pp. 556-558). See also at the end of <i>Seder Bo</i> in the Book of Exodus (Vol. II, pp. 174-175).</i> They apply even to an individual who serves [Him], for when there is a pious man who keeps all the commandments of his G-d, the Eternal G-d will guard him from sickness, barrenness and bereavement, and he will live out his days in goodness. But these blessings which are stated in this section are general ones applying to the people [as a whole], and they [take effect] when the whole of our people <i>shall all be righteous</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 60:21.</i> Therefore He mentions here always <i>the Land: and the Land shall yield;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 4.</i> <i>in your Land safely;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 5.</i> <i>peace in the Land;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> <i>out of the Land;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> <i>it shall not go through your Land</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i><br>Now we have already explained<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See in Genesis 17:1 (Vol. I, pp. 215-216), and 46:15 (pp. 556-558).

But although they are hidden miracles, for they are [brought about] by means of the natural events of the world occurring according to their habit, yet [the Torah mentions them separately because] they come to be known [as miracles] because of their constant and continuous occurrence in the whole Land. For if one righteous man lives and G-d takes away sickness from him, and he lives out his days, this also happens to some wicked people [and is thus not acknowledged as miraculous]. But when an entire land and a whole people always have rains coming in their season, and plenitude, security, peace, health, strength and defeat of their enemies, in a manner unparalleled in the whole world, it becomes known to all that <i>this is the Eternal’s doing</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 118:23.</i> Therefore He said [in connection with these blessings], <i>And all the peoples shall see that the Name of the Eternal is called upon thee, and they shall be afraid of thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:10.</i> And the opposite of this will occur because of the curses, when punishments will come upon the [whole] Land, just as He said, <i>and I will make your heaven as iron</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 19.</i> and punishments of sickness, as He said, <i>and sore sickness, and of long continuance</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:59.</i> meaning that the food will be spoiled and bring about sickness, and thus the miracle will be made known to all because of its continued existence amongst the whole people. Therefore it is written, <i>And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say when they see the plagues of that Land, and its sicknesses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:21.</i> For they will not wonder at that [single] man upon whom <i>all the curse that is written in this book shall lie</i><sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 19.</i> for it happens many times in the natural order of the world, among all nations, that bad happenings come upon a certain individual.

But the verse can be compared to someone saying: “That person did not eat unleavened bread on the Festival of Passover, but instead [ate] leavened bread.”<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The intent of this statement is that the transgressor has committed two sins: not only has he failed to fulfill the positive commandment of eating unleavened bread (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 168-169), but he has also eaten <i>chametz</i> during Passover, which is forbidden by a negative commandment (<i>ibid.</i>, Vol. II, pp. 194-195). In the same way Scripture states that Asa committed two sins: he failed to seek G-d, and he consulted the physicians.

When the post of chief of the Academy of Pumbeditha became vacant the Rabbis of Babylon were in doubt as to whom they should appoint — Rabbah or Rav Yoseph. Rabbah’s distinction was that he was the outstanding dialectician of his generation, while that of Rav Yoseph was that he was the greatest erudite scholar. When an inquiry was made of the Rabbis in the Land of Israel the answer came back: “An erudite scholar is preferable.” It was thus Rav Yoseph’s turn to become the head of the Academy. Yet in his humility Rav Yoseph refused to accept the post and insisted that Rabbah should reign. And thus for twenty-two years Rabbah continued to rule over the Academy of Pumbeditha. In recompense for his humility, the Talmudic story continues, Heaven rewarded Rav Yoseph that “During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned Rav Yoseph did not call even a bloodletter to his house,” as was customary in those days, for his health was in such perfect condition. — See in Ein Ya’akov at end of Horayoth, in the commentary Hakotheiv, at end, for source of this beautiful interpretation. It expresses no doubt the intent of Ramban’s words here before us.</i> “During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned [as head of the Academy at Pumbeditha], Rav Yoseph did not call even a blood letter to his house” [as he, being a righteous person, was protected directly by G-d and needed no physicians], and they also say by way of proverb:<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 6:17.</i> “A gate which is not open for the commandments [i.e., a house wherein the commandments are not observed] is open for the physician.” This is also the meaning of their saying:<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Berachoth 60 a.</i> “People should not have to take medicaments, but they have become accustomed to do so.” [That is to say]: had they not accustomed themselves to [taking] medicines, people would become sick according to the degree of punishment corresponding to their sin, and would be healed by the will of G-d, but since they accustomed themselves to medicaments, G-d has left them to natural happenings. This is also the intent of the Rabbis’ interpretation:<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Kamma 85 a.</i> “<i>And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:19.</i> From here [you deduce the principle] that permission has been given to the physician to heal.” They did not say that “permission was given to the sick to be healed” [by the physician], but instead they stated [by implication] that since the person who became sick comes [to the physician] to be healed, because he has accustomed himself to seeking medical help and <i>he was not of the congregation of</i> the Eternal <i>whose portion is in this life</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 27:3; Psalms 17:14.</i> the physician should not refrain from healing him; whether because of fear that he might die under his hand, since he is qualified in this profession, or because he says that it is G-d alone Who is the Healer of all flesh, since [after all] people have already accustomed themselves [to seeking such help]. Therefore when men contend and one smites the other <i>with a stone or his fist</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:18.</i> the one who smote must pay for the healing,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:19.</i> for the Torah does not base its laws upon miracles, just as it said, <i>for the poor shall never cease out of the Land</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 15:11.</i> knowing [beforehand] that such will be the case. But <i>when a man’s ways please the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 16:7.</i> he need have no concern with physicians.

Verse 12

AND I WILL WALK AMONG YOU. This means that My conduct with you will be well-known, as when a monarch walks in the midst of his army, supplying them with all their needs.<br>This then is the way of the simple sense of the words of the covenant, and it is true, for so indeed will He do with them. Now Scripture did not mention here the reward of the existence of the souls in the World of Souls,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">This is the world to which the soul of a person goes immediately following the death of the body. At the resurrection, body and soul will be reunited in the World to Come, which is the <i>Olam Haba</i>.</i> and in the World to Come after the resurrection, for their existence [following the death of the body] is a matter of necessity in the way of creation, as I have explained in [the section on] excisions,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 18:29.</i> this form of punishment being the “cutting off” of the guilty ones [from life eternal], and all the other [souls] will continue to exist on account of their fundamental nature inherent in their creation. But by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], these blessings [in this section] are also heavenly blessings in matters above, as I have explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 11.</i> Thus, <i>And I will give peace in the Land;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> <i>and My soul shall not abhor you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 11.</i> and similarly, <i>and I will walk among you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 12 before us.</i> allude to the [Divine] attribute which our Rabbis have called <i>Shechinah</i> (the Divine Presence), of [the root found in the expression], <i>And I will set ‘mishkani’</i> (<i>My dwelling</i>) <i>among you</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Verse 11.</i> and as the Rabbis say:<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to Deuteronomy 30:3.</i> “The <i>Shechinah</i> (Divine Presence) dwells with Israel.” And in Bereshith Rabbah they have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshith Rabbah 19:13.</i> “The Divine Presence was mainly in the lower world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">That is, even after Adam committed the first sin, the Divine Presence was still mainly in the lower world. With each progressive sin on the part of mankind, this Presence withdrew to the remote heavens, until the patriarchs appeared and gradually brought His Presence back into the lower world. When the Tabernacle was completed and His Glory came to dwell therein, the process of return was completed.</i> Thus the Garden of Eden [i.e., the World of Souls] and the World to Come [after the resurrection] are mentioned here<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">In the expressions: <i>And I will set My dwelling</i> (Verse 11); <i>and I will give peace in the Land</i> (Verse 6), as hinted to above (Ma’or V’shamesh).</i> to those who know [the way of Truth].<br>Now these blessings in their perfection will only occur when all Israel do the will of their Father [in heaven], and when [as a result of this] the structure of heaven and earth will be perfect, in accordance with its [original] plan. There are no other blessings in the Torah as perfect as these, which constitute the words of the covenant and the conditions between the Holy One, blessed be He, and us.<br>Know, [however], that Israel never attained these blessings in their perfection, neither many of them [i.e., as a people] nor as individuals, since their merits were never sufficient for them, just as the Rabbis have said with reference to David’s [captains]:<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Moed Katan 16 b.</i> “<i>And he</i> [Adino the Eznite] <i>lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 23:8.</i> But he [David] was troubled about the [remaining] two hundred.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">As the verse states, <i>How should one chase a thousand</i> (Deuteronomy 32:30) (Moed Katan 16b).</i> Thereupon a Divine Voice came forth and said to him, <i>Save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 15:5. In other words, because of the affair of Uriah (see II Samuel, Chapter 11) King David did not completely achieve that particular blessing mentioned in the Torah.</i> Therefore you will find our Rabbis of blessed memory speaking of [the fulfillment of] these verses [containing the blessings] in the future [which is yet] to come. [Thus they have said].<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Bechukothai</i> 2:2.</i> “This teaches that a child of Israel will in the future stretch forth [his hand into the pupil of an adder’s eye, and remove his gall through his mouth.” Similarly they have said]:<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:3.</i> “The Holy One, blessed be He, will in the future walk about with the righteous in the World to Come.” This is because [these blessings] have not yet been fulfilled, but they will be fulfilled for us at the time of [our] perfection.

Verse 15

AND IF YE SHALL REJECT MY STATUTES. Because “statutes” are commandments the reasons for which have not been revealed to the majority of the people,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">To the “majority of the people” the reasons for “the statutes” have not been revealed, but actually there are reasons for each and every precept of the Torah. See Ramban on Deuteronomy 22:6, where he develops this theme at great length.</i> therefore fools reject them, saying: “Why does G-d desire that I should not wear this garment which is woven with threads of linen and of blue wool?<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 19:19.</i> And how do we benefit by burning the [Red] Heifer, and sprinkling upon us the ashes thereof?”<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers Chapter 19.</i> The “ordinances,” however, everyone desires and everyone needs, for there can be no civilized life for any people or country without ordinances. No one will reject the ordinances of: <i>he that smiteth a man so that he dieth;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:12.</i> <i>and if men strive together;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 22.</i> and the laws of the ox and the pit<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 28-37.</i> and the [four] guardians,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 22:6-14.</i> and so on.

See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 9-11.</i> they will despise, because of [the necessity of keeping these] commandments, which constitute a heavy yoke upon the wicked. Therefore He said, <i>and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances so that ye will not do all My commandments</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15 before us.</i> for their abhorrence of the “ordinances” is in order that they should not keep the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, they reject even the rational parts of the Torah in order to “free” themselves entirely of the commandments which they find a burden to keep.</i>
THAT YE MAKE VOID MY COVENANT.

Verse 16

APH ANI E’ESEH ZOTH LACHEM’ (ALSO I WILL DO THIS UNTO YOU). By way of the Truth, the meaning [of this verse is] as if it were inverted: <i>‘aph ani zoth e’eseh lachem’</i> [meaning: “also <i>ani</i> — the term for the Divine attribute called <i>zoth</i>, which signifies judgment — will do unto you”]. This is why He always mentions in this section the word <i>ani</i> (I): <i>then will ‘ani’</i> (<i>I</i>) <i>also walk;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> <i>And ‘ani’</i> (I) <i>also will smite you;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> <i>and ‘ani’</i> (I) <i>also will chastise you;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 28.</i> <i>and ‘ani</i> (I) <i>will bring the Land into desolation;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 32.</i> <i>‘ani’</i> (I) <i>also will walk contrary unto them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 41.</i> And in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah [we find it interpreted]:<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Habahir, 66. See Vol. I, p. 24, Note 42.</i> “It will not suffice for Me [merely] to pronounce judgment [and have it executed by a messenger], but <i>even I also</i> will chastise [you], etc.”<br>The principle [of this section] is that it is the Holy One, blessed be He, Who makes this covenant, and this is the meaning of the expressions: <i>seven for your sins;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Verses: 18, 24, 28. See my Hebrew commentary p. 187.</i> <i>seven according to your sins</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 21.</i> And the oaths are [thus] the oaths of the covenant, for the expressions are from the mouth of the Almighty, [speaking] in the language of the first person: <i>‘I’ will do;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 16 before us.</i> <i>and ‘I’ will chastise;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 28.</i> <i>and ‘I’ will smite</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 24.</i> Therefore Scripture states [concerning this covenant], <i>which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 46.</i> for He by His Great Name made this covenant. But in the Book of Deuteronomy [Scripture] states, <i>If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:15.</i> and it continually mentions there an expression of cursing, thus it starts them [the words of the covenant] with: <i>cursed shalt thou be</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> since the blessing is absent from them, and it further states, <i>the Eternal will make</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 24.</i> It is this which is the [intention of the] saying of our Rabbis:<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Megillah 31 b.</i> “The imprecations of the Book of Leviticus were [prounounced] in plural terms [<i>if ‘ye’ will not hearken … if ‘ye’ shall reject …</i>], and Moses, in saying them, said them from the mouth of the Almighty [stating: “Thus did the Holy One blessed be He, say unto me, <i>‘If ye will not hearken unto Me’</i> “], but those [imprecations mentioned] in the Book of Deuteronomy were [pronounced] in the singular [<i>if ‘thou’ wilt not hearken … which I command ‘thee'…</i>] and Moses in saying them said them [as though they came] from his own mouth, for the Almighty made Moses a messenger between Him and between all Israel.”<br>Know and understand that these oaths [stated in this section] allude to the first exile [i.e., the Babylonian exile following the destruction of the First Temple], for it is with reference to the First Temple that all the words of this covenant, concerning the exile and the redemption therefrom, apply. For thus you will see in the exhortations [here] that He stated, <i>And if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> and He further stated, <i>that ye void My covenant</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 15.</i> mentioning among them [the rejected statutes]: the high places [on which they offered forbidden sacrifices], sun-images, and idols,<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 30.</i> and it was [in the times of the First Temple] that they worshipped idols and did all evil things. It is in connection with this that He said, <i>And I will bring your Sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> thus warning them that He will remove from them His Sanctuary and the acceptance of the offerings which were favorable to Him in that Sanctuary, and the punishments which were to follow upon them were: the sword,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 25.</i> wild beasts,<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 22.</i> pestilence,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 25.</i> famine,<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 26.</i> and finally exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 33.</i> And all these things occurred then [at the destruction of the First Temple], as is clearly stated in the Book of Jeremiah. Of that [first] exile He stated, <i>Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 34.</i> <i>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have a rest; even the rest which it had not</i> [<i>in your Sabbath</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 35.</i> because the years of the [Babylonian] exile were [as many] as the years in which they failed to observe [the laws of] the Sabbatical years.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi in Verse 35, who explains how the seventy years of the Babylonian exile correspond exactly to the seventy Sabbatical and Jubilee years that Israel failed to observe in the Land.</i> So also does Scripture state concerning that exile, [that it was] <i>To fulfill the word of the Eternal by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the Land had been paid her Sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">II Chronicles 36:21.</i> Thus He warned them and thus it happened to them. If so, it is clear that Scripture speaks here of that [first] exile.<br>If you examine further the subject of the redemption from it [the Babylonian exile, you see], that He only assures [Israel] that He will remember the covenant of the fathers,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 42.</i> and of the remembrance of the Land,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 42.</i> but not that He will forgive their iniquity and their sin and that He will once again love them as of old, nor that He will gather together those of them who are dispersed. For such indeed happened when they came up from Babylon, for only [the tribes of] Judah and Benjamin returned together with a small group of Levites who were with them, and some<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban’s Sefer Hage’ulah (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, pp. 272-4) for a full discussion of this important matter — that in the return from Babylon there were small groups from the other tribes besides Judah and Benjamin, but the main bulk of them remained in their places, and hence the words of the prophets announcing their complete return, not having been fulfilled during the Second Temple, will yet assuredly come to transpire in the future. This is the deeper significance of Ramban’s expression here: “and <i>some</i> of the other tribes …” — “some” but not all, and therefore the words of G-d as spoken by His prophets will still be fulfilled in the future when the <i>ge’ulah shleimah</i> (the perfect redemption) will take place, as the return from Babylon did not represent that final and complete redemption. It is obvious that this constitutes a major principle in our faith of Israel’s future and destiny. Ramban will touch upon this theme of the perfect redemption further on in the text. See also further, Note 154.</i> of the [other] tribes that had been exiled to Babylon, and they returned in poverty, and in servitude to the kings of Persia.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezra 9:9.</i> Nor does He state that they will return to Him in complete repentance, but only that <i>they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 40.</i> and we find that the people of the Second Temple did so, as Daniel confessed: <i>We have sinned, we have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 9:5.</i> <i>O Eternal, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8. Thus they confessed also the sins of their fathers. The same applies to the following verses.</i> And it is further written, <i>because of our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are a reproach</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> And so did Nehemiah confess.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 1:6-7.</i> And Ezra said, <i>Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept Thy law</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:34. It should be noted that Scripture there ascribes the actual confession to the Levites, and Ezra’s name is not directly mentioned. However, the implication in Chapter 8 Verse 13 is clearly that it was at Ezra’s instigation that they kept the Festival of Tabernacles and the subsequent confession following it (see <i>ibid.</i>, 9:1). Besides, Ezra being a priest (<i>ibid.</i>, 8:2) he was automatically of the tribe of Levi and was thus included among the Levites who recited the confession.</i> Thus they all deduced from the Torah that they should confess their iniquity and [also] the iniquity of their fathers. All these [matters] are clear indications that this covenant does indeed allude to the first exile and the redemption therefrom.<br>However the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:1-69.</i> alludes to this our [present] exile, and to the redemption by which we will be redeemed from it. Thus we observe first that there [in the second covenant] neither the end nor the duration [of the exile] are alluded to, and that He did not assure us of redemption [i.e., promising that it would take place at a certain future time as was the case with the Babylonian captivity, whose end was foretold as a definite event in our section here in Leviticus as explained above], but He made it dependent upon [our] repentance. Neither did He mention among the sins [for which they would be exiled that] they would make any Asherim and sun-images, or that they would worship any idols whatsoever. Rather, He said, <i>But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:15.</i> thus stating that because they will transgress some of His commandments, and will not keep and observe all of them,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they will “transgress” some of the negative commandments and “not keep and observe” the positive commandments.</i> they would be punished. Such indeed was the case during the Second Temple, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 9 b.</i> “Why was the First Temple destroyed? Because of idolatry, immorality and bloodshed. But the Second Temple, of which we know that they [the people of that period], were engaged in the study of Torah and the practice of loving kindness, why was it destroyed? It was because of the causeless enmity which was among them.” Neither does He mention there [in the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy] the Sanctuary, or “the pleasing odor” [of the offerings], as He mentioned here,<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 31.</i> because the [Heavenly] fire did not come down and consume the offerings [that were brought] in the Second Temple, as the Rabbis testified there in Tractate Yoma.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 21 b. Thus, as it were, there never was a “pleasing odor” in the days of the Second Temple which could be removed at its destruction.</i> And He further states there among the imprecations, <i>The Eternal will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the vulture swoops down</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:49.</i> alluding to the coming upon them of the Romans, who were very far from them. Thus He states there, <i>a nation that thou hast not known;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 36.</i> <i>a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:49.</i> because of their great distance from our Land. Such is not the case concerning the words of this covenant [before us], for [it speaks of the time when] they were exiled to Babylon and Assyria, which are near to [our] Land, and they always warred with them;<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, the verse in Deuteronomy 28:49 [<i>The Eternal will bring a nation … from the end of the earth …</i>] could not apply to the period of the First Temple, as their warring enemies were nearby. The case was far different during the Second Temple when the Romans came from far-off Italy.</i> and the stock of Israel comes from there, and they [the Jews] knew their language, as it is said, <i>Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Aramean language, for we understand it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 18:26.</i> Similarly, the verse stating [there in the Book of Deuteronomy], <i>And the Eternal shall scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth unto the other</i><sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:64.</i> is [a reference to] our exile today, in which we are scattered from one end of the world to the other. Again He stated [there], <i>And the Eternal shall bring thee back into Egypt in ships</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 68.</i> and this happened in our [present] exile, when Titus filled the ships with them [captives], as it is written in the books of the Romans.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Reference is to the book of Josippon, Chapter 95. See Vol. I, p. 604, Note 249.</i> Similarly, that which Scripture says there, <i>Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thy eyes shall see;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:32.</i> <i>Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be thine, for they shall go into captivity</i><sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 41. Ramban’s illuminating comment on these verses (see following text) brings to light the ruthless cruelty of the Romans at the destruction of the Second Temple, when they deported all the young and only “the fathers [i.e. the old] remained in the Land.”</i> — these are not references to the [Babylonian] exile, when both fathers and sons were exiled, but [refer] to that captivity of the sons alone [following the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans], when the fathers remained in the Land. Such is not stated in the first covenant, because the exile [which it speaks of] was a complete one [for both fathers and sons], but it is mentioned in the second covenant, because the Romans ruled in our Land and took the sons and daughters at their will. Similarly, [the verse stating], <i>Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Eternal shall send against thee in hunger, and in thirst</i><sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 48.</i> is a reference to our servitude when we were subject to the Romans in our Land, and their officers ruled over us, pressing upon us a heavy yoke and taking away our people and our wealth, as is known in the [history] books. Another proof [that the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy refers to the exile after the destruction of the Second Temple] is that He said, <i>The Eternal will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 36.</i> for King Agrippa<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">This was Agrippa II, a loyal servant of Rome. He was the last king of Judea. During the siege of Jerusalem he was with Titus, and following the fall of the city he took part in arranging the Roman triumphal celebrations in Caesarea! He was the opposite of his father King Agrippa I, who in his genuine attachment to the Jewish people and religion won the love of all classes of the people.</i> went to Rome at the end of the [period of the] Second Temple, and on account of his going there the Temple was destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Ramban here is referring to Josippon Chapter 65, where it is narrated that “King Agrippa went to Nero, emperor of Rome, and told him all these things [concerning the Jewish uprising against Rome], whereupon Nero sent against the Jews the Roman general etc.” This was the beginning of the war which culminated in the fall of Jerusalem.</i> Now Scripture does not state: “the king who will rule over thee,” but it says, <i>thy king whom ‘thou shalt set’</i>. Thus He, blessed be He, is hinting to us that he [that ruler] was not fit to be king, since he was forbidden to be king over Israel according to the law of the Torah [as he was a descendant of King Herod, the son of Antipater the Idumean, and Scripture states, <i>thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 17:15.</i> but they “set up” him and his fathers as kings over them against the law, as is mentioned in Tractate Sotah.<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah 41 b.</i><br>Now all the hints such as these clearly indicate that the meaning of this matter is this our [present] exile, and the redemption [mentioned] in this second covenant, which will be a complete redemption, superior to all [preceding ones]. Thus He said, <i>And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse</i> etc.;<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 30:1.</i> and He promised, <i>And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i> this being a promise to all the tribes of Israel, not [merely] to one-sixth<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which constitute one-sixth of the twelve tribes. Ramban is thus stating that the redemption from the Babylonian exile was not a complete redemption, since the return consisted mainly of two tribes [with small groups of the other tribes, see above Note 124]. But the Divine promise stated in Deuteronomy 30:5 [as mentioned here in the text] refers to <i>all</i> tribes of Israel. Hence the coming redemption will be more complete than all preceding ones.</i> of the people; and there He promised [also] that He would cut down and destroy those who caused our exile, as it is said, <i>And the Eternal thy G-d will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 7.</i> the expressions, <i>thine enemies</i> and <i>those that hate thee</i> alluding to the two nations<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the two dominant religions in Ramban’s times — that of Edom and Ishmael — which persecuted the Jews [and still continue to do so] in countless ways.

Now these words [<i>And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers</i><sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 5.</i>] assure us of the coming redemption with a more perfect assurance than all the visions of Daniel.<br>Similarly, that which He stated here, <i>and your enemies that shall dwell therein shall be desolate in it</i><sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Further, Verse 32.</i> constitutes a good tiding, proclaiming that during all our exiles, our Land will not accept our enemies. This also is a great proof and assurance to us, for in the whole inhabited part of the world one cannot find such a <i>good and large Land</i><sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 3:8.</i> which was always lived in and yet is as ruined as it is [today],<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">When these words were written — sometime after the middle of the thirteenth century — the Land of Israel had just experienced the Mongolian invasion (of 1259-60), which following upon the constant wars of the Crusaders, left the country in total ruin.</i> for since the time that we left it, it has not accepted any nation or people, and they all try to settle it, but to no avail.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">A clear reference to the many nations that have tried — and failed — to cultivate the Land of Israel since the Jews were driven from it by the Romans. This indubitable historical fact is, as Ramban correctly points out, “a great proof” that the Land belongs to Israel. Witness also the miraculous response of the Land since the recent return of the Jews to its borders.</i><br>Now the first covenant mentioned in this section the Holy One, blessed be He, made, for His Great Name was indeed with us in the First Temple, and the second covenant in the section of <i>V’hayah Ki Thavo</i><sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 26:1. — The covenant referred to is <i>ibid.</i>, 28:1-68.</i> expressed by the mouth of Moses, alludes to the removal of his Divine Presence entirely, since in the Second Temple only the Glory of His Name was present, as it is said, <i>and I will take pleasure in it</i> i.e., the Second Temple] <i>‘v’ikavdah’</i> (<i>and I will be glorified</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Haggai 1:8.</i> The additional letter <i>hei</i><sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>v’ikavdah</i> is in this instance actually written <i>without</i> the <i>hei</i> at the end.

Verse 41

O’ (OR) THEN PERCHANCE THEIR UNCIRCUMCISED HEART BE HUMBLED. “[The word <i>o</i> here has the same meaning] as in <i>‘o’</i> (<i>or</i>) <i>it is known that the ox was wont to gore</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:36.</i> Another interpretation is [that the word <i>o</i> means] ‘perhaps’ — perhaps then their uncircumcised heart will be humbled; <i>and they then be paid the punishment of their iniquity</i>, meaning that they will achieve atonement for their iniquities through their sufferings.” This is Rashi’s language. The correct interpretation appears to me to be that He is stating: “<i>And I will bring them into the land of their enemies, o</i> (either) until such time when <i>their uncircumcised heart will be humbled, o</i> (or) until the time when <i>they will have been paid the punishment of their iniquity</i> by the length of the exile.”<br>Now it is after [the verse], <i>and they shall confess their iniquity</i><sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 40.</i> that He should have said, <i>Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob</i> etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 42.</i> for what reason is there [to state here, between these two verses] <i>and I will bring them into the lands of their enemies</i>, since this is not a time when He would exile them and bring them into the lands of their enemies [since they have just confessed their sins]! Therefore Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted [the verse to mean]: “This also I did with them, that I punished them by bringing them into the land of their enemies in order to humble their uncircumcised heart.” And He mentioned this here [in order to indicate] that they confessed their sin “because it was I Who brought this about, for even at the time that they became corrupted, My intent was that they should repent and confess.”<br>In my opinion He hints here [by placing the verses in this order] that [even] after the confession [of their sins], He will walk contrary to them and will still bring them into the land of their enemies until their uncircumcised heart is humbled, this being an allusion that He will bring them back into the Land but it will not be subdued before them; rather, they will have adversaries and enemies there, as it is said, <i>And our adversaries said;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 4:5.</i> <i>And it came to pass when our enemies heard</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 9.</i> The Land [at that time, when they returned from Babylon], was in the hands of foreign peoples, just as Ezra said in his prayer: <i>Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the Land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold we are servants in it. And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins; also they have power over us, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 9:36-37.</i>

Verse 42

THEN WILL I REMEMBER MY COVENANT WITH JACOB. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that this [is a case where a word] draws along with itself another [similar] word, thus meaning: “Then will I remember My covenant, the covenant with Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">The reason for this explanation is that the word <i>brithi</i> (My covenant) is grammatically equivalent to saying <i>habrith sheli</i> (the covenant of Mine). Now since a noun that is preceded by the definite article cannot be in the construct state, it follows that there is a word implied here, which makes it: <i>eth brithi ‘brith’ Ya’akov</i> (My covenant, the covenant of Jacob). A similar explanation applies to the following two verses which Ramban mentions.</i> Similarly: <i>the prophecy of Oded the prophet;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">II Chronicles 15:8. Here too the meaning is: <i>v’hanevuah ‘nevuath’ Oded hanavi’</i> (and the prophecy — a prophecy of Oded the prophet).</i> <i>your heads of your tribes</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 29:9. The meaning here too is: <i>rasheichem ‘rashei’ shivteichem</i> (your heads — heads of your tribes).</i> <i>And the Land I will remember</i>. The meaning thereof is that I will remember the Land, and that it was paid its Sabbaths and lay forsaken without them, and I will remember that they have atoned for their iniquity.”<br>It is possible according to the way of Truth, [the mystic doctrines of the Cabala], that He is saying: “And I will remember Jacob and Isaac and Abraham, who are the men of the covenant,” for all attributes are so called when they are in the covenant; “<i>v’ha’aretz</i> (and the earth),<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 25:2 (towards the end) about the meaning of the word <i>ha’aretz</i>.</i> which is composed of them all, I will remember among them.” Our Rabbis have so alluded. Thus they said:<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabbah 36:7.</i> “And why does He mention the merit of <i>ha’aretz</i> with them? Said Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: This is like the case of a master who had three daughters, and one maidservant who raised them. Whenever the master asked about the welfare of his daughters, he would say: ‘Ask on my behalf about the welfare of she who raises them.’”

Verse 43

<i>And the Land shall lie forsaken without them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 43.</i> This means that even after the remembring [of the covenant and the Land] it shall lie forsaken without them, hinting that even after the decree of Cyrus<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">II Chronicles 36:22-23.</i> [granting the Jews in Babylon permission to return and rebuild the Temple], the Land will still lie forsaken without them and her Sabbatical years, until nineteen years<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to Ezra 1:1.</i> after the Temple was rebuilt; and then they sanctified the city [of Jerusalem] with two thanks-offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 12:40. See also Shevuoth 14 a.</i> and the sanctity of the Land was restored,<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">See Note 131 in <i>Seder Behar</i>.</i> and they made the covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 10:1.</i> and declared [among other conditions] <i>and that we would forego the Seventh year and the exaction of every debt</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 32. I.e., they undertook to keep the Sabbatical laws with respect to cessation of agricultural work and cancellation of debts.</i> All events that happened to them [at the beginning of their return to the Land after the Babylonian exile] are alluded to in this section.

Verse 44



Verse 45

AND I WILL FOR THEIR SAKES REMEMBER THE COVENANT OF THEIR ANCESTORS. This means that I will remember it for their sakes whether in the Land or outside the Land, both in the [first] exile alluded to here and likewise throughout all generations. This is the sense of the expression <i>in the sight of the nations</i> [<i>And I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors … in the sight of the nations</i>], for He will do [good] to them because of His Great Name, so that it be not profaned among the nations, but not for their sake, since they have not repented, and [thus] their iniquities have not been forgiven. And so did our Rabbis say:<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Torath Kohanim, <i>Bechukothai</i> 8:10.</i> “<i>I will not reject them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 44.</i> in the days of Vespasian.<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">The Roman emperor in whose days the Second Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Temple is thus in no sense a rejection of Israel. The survival of Israel long after the downfall of the Romans who destroyed the Temple, as well as the growth of Torah throughout the generations, and Israel’s present return to the Land after an enforced absence of nearly 1900 years — these are sufficient proofs that He did not reject us in the days of Vespasian.</i> <i>Neither will I abhor them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 44.</i> in the days of Greece.<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the wars that took place during the Hellenistic period, when the Syrian Greeks who attempted to suppress the practice of Judaism were defeated by the Jews under the leadership of the Hasmoneans, and the Jews also regained their political independence.</i> [<i>Neither will I abhor them</i>] <i>to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 44.</i> in the days of Haman. <i>For I am the Eternal their G-d</i><sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 44.</i> in the days of Gog and Magog.”<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel Chapters 38-39. In the war of Gog and Magog G-d will finally overthrow the enemies of Israel who had assembled from all parts of the world against the Land of Israel.

Chapter 27



Verse 1

AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING … WHEN A MAN SHALL CLEARLY UTTER A VOW. This section also is joined [to Chapter 25 above] as having been declared on Mount Sinai;<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">See Ramban above, 25:1.</i> and it is attached to the exhortations [in the preceding section] because it is concerned with the ordinances of the Jubilee, [and the exhortations speak also of the failure to keep the Jubilee], as He mentions in the case of a person who dedicates a field he has bought<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 22-24.</i> or a field of his inheritance;<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Verses 16-21.</i> but He included here in one section the ordinances of all who vow [donations of any sort to the Sanctuary]. It is for this reason that He stated at the end, <i>These are the commandments, which the Eternal commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 34.</i> [which refers to] all that has been said above, for from then on [i.e., in the Book of Numbers] He speaks of the commandments that were declared in the Tent of Meeting.

ONLY THE FIRSTBORN OF THE BEASTS … NO MAN SHALL SANCTIFY IT — “as a different offering, because it is not his.” Thus the language of Rashi. The correct interpretation is that He is saying: “there is no need to sanctify it [the firstling], for <i>whether it be ox or sheep, it is the Eternal’s</i> automatically.” The verse is thus [to be understood] as a negation.<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">See in Exodus. Vol. II, p. 350, Note 71.</i> And in the Book of Deuteronomy He stated, <i>All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the Eternal thy G-d</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 15:19. This verse does not mean that the owner is to declare it “holy,” since it is automatically holy by virtue of being the firstborn, but, as Ramban continues, that we are to regard it as holy, etc.</i> meaning that it is holy and that you are to treat it with holiness, so that you are not to do work with it, nor shear it,<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 15:19. This verse does not mean that the owner is to declare it “holy,” since it is automatically holy by virtue of being the firstborn, but, as Ramban continues, that we are to regard it as holy, etc.</i> and that you are to <i>eat it before the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> as He will explain.

Verse 27

AND IF IT BE AN ANIMAL FORBIDDEN TO BE EATEN [dedicated to the Temple], THEN HE SHALL RANSOM IT ACCORDING TO THY VALUATION. “This verse does not refer to the firstling [mentioned in the preceding verse], because one cannot state about the firstling of a forbidden animal, <i>then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation</i> [since among all forbidden animals, only the firstborn of an ass has to be redeemed]. It cannot refer to [the firstling of] an ass, since the [animal given in] redemption of an ass is only a lamb<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 13:13.</i> [while here the animal is to be redeemed <i>according to thy valuation</i>, i.e., as you wish], and [moreover the lamb given in redemption of a firstling ass is a] gift to the priest, and is not given to the Temple treasury [as is stated here]. Rather, the verse refers to something dedicated to the Temple treasury [and is a continuation of Verse 11], for above [in Verse 11] He spoke about redeeming a [dedicated] animal which is fit to be eaten and which became blemished [thus disqualifying it as an offering], and here [in the verse before us] He speaks of a case where one dedicated for Temple repairs an animal which is not permitted to be eaten, [or offered up].” Thus far the language of Rashi.<br>It is possible that we answer [Rashi’s argument as to why this verse cannot be referring to the redemption of this firstling of an ass, and that we do interpret it as referring to such a case, by saying] that because He stated [in the preceding verse], <i>Only the firstborn of the beasts, which is born as a firstling to the Eternal, no man shall sanctify it</i>, therefore He reverted [to this subject] and stated [in the verse before us] that if the firstling that he sanctified be of an animal that is forbidden to be eaten, <i>then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation</i>, explaining that [the law of] the firstling does not apply to forbidden animals, except for the firstling of an ass, the law of which has already been explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 13:13.</i> Thus He taught [here] that even if a person did dedicate it, its sanctity is not like that of the law of a [permitted] firstling [which can never be redeemed], but it is like anything else which is dedicated to the Temple treasury, and it may be redeemed. Therefore He stated [here] that he who dedicated it redeems it by adding one-fifth [to its actual value], whereas another person may redeem it <i>according to thy valuation</i> [without the additional one-fifth]. And the verse above [11] stating, <i>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering</i>, refers, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, to an animal that may not be eaten [not to the firstling of an ass, which has been dedicated to the Temple treasury]. According to the interpretation of our Rabbis,<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Temurah 32 b.</i> there is a redundant expression in that verse [11 above], since He repeated <i>an unclean beast, of which they may not bring an offering to the Eternal</i> [it being self-understood that an offering may not be brought from an animal that may not be eaten]. Therefore the Rabbis interpreted it as follows: “<i>and if it be any unclean beast</i>, or [if it be] <i>of which they may not bring an offering unto the Eternal</i>,” thus including [permitted] animals which have become permanently blemished, of which offerings may not be brought [and thus if they were dedicated to the Temple treasury, the law stated in the verse is to be applied].

Verse 28



Verse 29

NONE DOOMED WHO SHALL BE DOOMED OF MAN, SHALL BE REDEEMED. “[This means that] if a person is about to be executed [by the court], and someone else says, ‘I take upon myself to pay his valuation [to the Temple treasury],’ his vow is of no effect.” HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. “For you see he is going to die. Therefore he is not to be redeemed; he has neither a market-price nor a fixed valuation” [as fixed by the Torah on the basis of his age]. This is Rashi’s language. But our Rabbis have differed on this matter, some saying<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Arakhin 6 b. The name of the Sage holding this opinion is Rabbi Yishmael.</i> that it constitutes an admonition in connection with those who are liable to the death-penalty, that one must not take a ransom from them in order to free them. It is possible that He mentions this admonition here in order to state that he [the condemned] cannot give money to [the Temple of] G-d as other devoted things [are given], and thereby go free of punishment.<br>By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse is stating that whatever a man devotes of his belongings, whether man or animal or field of his possession, <i>it is holy unto the Eternal</i>, meaning that they become devoted things of the priests, and there is no redemption for them. But if he devotes people who are not his, such as those who go to war against their enemies and utter a vow, <i>If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then will I utterly destroy their cities</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 21:2.</i> then all the people found in them are to die. The reason for this is that the intention of those making such a vow is not that [the captives] be given to the priests, but rather that it be forbidden to derive any benefit from them, since their purpose is to utterly destroy the enemies. Thus we find in the case of the men of Jabesh-gilead who transgressed the oath of the assembly by not coming to Mitzpah [to take part in the battle against Gibeah for the outrage they had committed],<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">See Judges Chapter 19.</i> that it is written, <i>And the congregation sent thither ten thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them saying: ‘Go and smite the inhabitants with the edge of the sword’</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 21:10.</i> And common sense does not allow [us to say] that the whole congregation perpetrated such an evil deed, killing many people of Israel who were not guilty of death! And Phinehas was there,<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, 20:28.</i> and by word of his mouth the whole affair was done! I have further found in the Agadah, in the [Midrash] Yelamdeinu:<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">I have found this in the Yalkut Shimoni, <i>Shoftim</i> 76. On “Yelamdeinu” see in <i>Seder Bo</i> (Vol. II, p. 131, Note 196).</i> “We have been taught: Rabbi Akiba says, <i>Cheirem</i> (‘doomed to destruction’) is an oath, and an oath is <i>cheirem</i>. The men of Jabesh transgressed the <i>cheirem</i>, and thus they became liable to the death penalty.”<br>Therefore I say that it was from this verse [before us] that they deduced this law — that if any king of Israel, or the Great Sanhedrin [of seventy-one judges] in the presence of all Israel, who have the authority to institute ordinances [for the good of the people], if they declare a certain city <i>cheirem</i>, to be warred on, and likewise if they declare a certain matter <i>cheirem</i>, he who violates it is liable to the death-penalty. This indeed was the guilt of the men of Jabesh-gilead [as mentioned above], and of Jonathan, to whom his father [Saul] had said, <i>‘G-d do so and more also, thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 14:44.</i> Now on the basis of what legal authority did these people deserve death, if not because of this source [in Scripture]?<br>And this was the mistake that Jephthah made with his daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">See Judges 11:30-34, where it is related that Jephthah vowed <i>that whosoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the Eternal’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt-offering</i>, and it was his daughter who came out to meet him first.</i> For he thought that just as a <i>cheirem</i> [“doomed” object] of the chief of Israel is valid and takes effect to put [certain] people to death, and [also] anyone who transgresses it is liable to the death-penalty, so [Jephthah thought] that if he uttered a vow at a time of war, to make an offering of a certain person or persons, the vow is valid; but he did not know that a <i>cheirem</i> declared by the king and Sanhedrin is valid [only] regarding the destruction of rebels, or against one who transgresses their decrees and ordinances. But that a vow should take effect to make a burnt-offering of something not appropriate for G-d, [as Jephthah thought] — Heaven forbid! Therefore the Rabbis have said in Bereshith Rabbah<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshith Rabbah 60:3.</i> that [Jephthah] was not even obliged to pay the price of her market-value to the Temple treasury [as his vow was totally invalid], and he was punished for her [innocent] blood!<br>Now do not let yourself be misled by Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra’s<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">The source is unknown to me since we have no commentary of Ibn Ezra on the Book of Judges. This interpretation, however, is found in the commentary of Ralbag.</i> empty words, when he says that the meaning of the expression <i>and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering</i><sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 11:31.</i> is “or I will offer it up,” as if to say: “if that which comes forth of the doors of my house be a man or woman, that person shall be holy to G-d, inasmuch as he will abstain from the ways of the world, <i>to stand to minister in the Name of the Eternal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:5.</i> in prayer and thanksgiving to G-d; but if it be something fit for an offering, I will make it a burnt-offering.” Accordingly [Ibn Ezra’s interpretation continues, since Jephthah’s daughter was the first to come out to meet her father], he built her a house outside the city where she resided in seclusion, and he provided her with sustenance all her days, <i>and no man knew her</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 24:16.</i> so that his daughter remained shut away [from the world all her life].<br>All this are words of emptiness. For if he vowed that [whatsoever comes forth of the door of his house] <i>shall be the Eternal’s</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 11:31.</i> this does not mean that he should be a recluse [from the world], but instead he is to be like Samuel, of whom his mother said, <i>and I shall give him unto the Eternal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 1:11.</i> and he was a servant in the House of G-d, not a recluse. And according to the ordinances of the Torah, no man can utter a vow which will bind the persons who come out of the door of his house to live thereafter in seclusion, just as he cannot bring them as an offering. And if the matter be so [as Ibn Ezra put it] then Jephthah’s daughter would be bewailing her virginity with her companions with her,<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 11:38.</i> like harlots enhancing their hire!<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 16:31.</i> Heaven forbid that this be a custom in Israel, <i>to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year</i><sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 11:39-40. Ramban’s comment here is typical of Jewish teaching which abhors celibacy.</i> because she did not marry and she worshipped G-d in purity! Rather, this whole subject is to be understood in its plain meaning [that Jephthah actually brought her as an offering], and his mistake was as I have explained.<br>And according to the opinion of our Rabbis, of blessed memory, it is possible that this verse [before us] includes many [different] subjects, similar to the verse, <i>Ye shall not eat with the blood;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 19:26. See Ramban there.</i> and like the verse, <i>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children</i><sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 24:16.</i> which the Rabbis interpret<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 27 b. The meaning of the verse is thus: a parent cannot be condemned on the evidence of his children.</i> as invalidating the testimony of relatives, and Scripture further states concerning it: <i>But the children of the murderers he</i> [King Amaziah of Judah] <i>put not to death, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as the Eternal commanded, saying, ‘The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers.’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">II Kings 14:6. Here it is obvious that the Rabbis also understood the verse in its literal sense — that children are not to be put to death for the sins of their parents, and vice versa.</i> Similarly this verse [before us] includes the law of one who vows to give to the Temple treasury the valuation of a person who is liable to the death-penalty [as explained above], the law of those against whom a <i>cheirem</i> is declared at a time of conquest, as we have said, and the law of one who transgresses the <i>cheirem</i> of the Great Court or of the king of Israel, as was the case in the incident of Saul [and Jonathan mentioned above]. It is with reference to that that it is said there, <i>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he die not</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 14:45.</i> for since the Torah states, <i>he shall not be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">In Verse 29 before us.</i> it says there, <i>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he die not;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 14:45.</i> [meaning] that since a miracle happened through him [i.e., that the Philistines suffered a great defeat on that day], they knew that it was in error that Jonathan had acted [contrary to the <i>cheirem</i> of his father]. And this is the sense of the expression [of the people in speaking on behalf of Jonathan], <i>who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 14:45.</i> And so likewise did Yonathan ben Uziel translate this expression: “For before the Eternal it is revealed that he [Jonathan] acted in error on that day, and so the people rescued Jonathan.”
Thus is completed the Book of the Law of the Priests [i.e., the Book of Leviticus], their offerings and their commandments.<br>May G-d the Most High restore matters to their [former] condition, the Levites to their song, the priests to their ministry, and Israel to their mighty habitation.<br>And may our eyes behold Jerusalem, the garden of the Palace;<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">The Sanctuary is “the Palace” and Jerusalem “the garden of the Palace.” The expression is taken from Esther 1:5. See, however, at end of his Sermon on the New Year (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 289) where Ramban refers to the whole Land of Israel as “the Palace of the King.”</i><br><i>And the Palace upon its wonted place</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 30:18.</i><br>The Temple and the Innermost Sanctuary upon their firm foundation, and <i>the daughters of Judah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 97:8. This is a reference to the cities of Judah surrounding Jerusalem.</i> in their security.<br><i>Then will the offering of Judah be pleasant unto the Eternal as in the days of old</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 3:4.</i> and as in their ancient years.<br>And acceptable upon His altar will be the Daily Whole-offerings in their order and the Additional Offerings according to their law.
Finished and completed is the Book of Leviticus with the help of G-d.
