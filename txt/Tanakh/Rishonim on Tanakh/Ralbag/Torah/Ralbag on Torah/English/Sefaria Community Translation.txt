Verse 1

[This section comments on] "And it was after these things..." until the end of the Parshah.
An Explanation of the Events of the Story
[The Torah now] makes mention that "After these things" Hashem, the All-Powerful, tested Avraham if it would be easy in his eyes to do anything that Hashem, the All-Powerful, might command him, and he said to him that he should take "his only son that he loves" (that being Yitzchak) and go to the land of Moriyah, and bring him up there for an Olah[an entirely burnt offering which "rises" to God] on one of the mountains of Moriyah which Hashem would say to him. And here the Hashem, the All-Powerful, was was intending with this statement [to tell him] that he should "bring him up for the purpose of an Olah," by which I mean to say that he should show Yitzchak there the [process of] offering of an Olah for Hashem, so that he might become educated in the service of Hashem, the All-Powerful and [ so that] he might reach his perfection [of character], [this all being] within the method/way [of the destiny of Avraham, which was] that it was fitting that the chosen offspring should be from him[Yitzchak] that Hashem, the All-Powerful, had destined to [have descend] from Avraham. And since that which may [most easily] be understood from this statement would be that which was understood from it according to the conduct [displayed by Avraham] in the story, that he should bring his son Yitzchak up there as an [actual] Olah when he sacrifices him and burns him, we see here that Hashem, the All-Powerful, has perfected a challenge for Avraham in this prophecy, [that being] would it be easy in his eyes to do anything which may become suitable [to be done] for the Hashem's Honor, and this [challenge] is [really] that if this is shown to be easy in his eyes, he shall not later come to understand from this matter [any deeper lesson] aside that which he understood of it at the beginning of the analysis [he made of Hashem's request]; but if it is difficult [to do this] in his eyes he will ask for a different [possible] intention behind the statement, aside from that which he understood at the beginning of the matter. And we see here that Avraham understood this prophecy according to that which may be understood at the beginning of the analysis. And despite all this, Avraham became eager and was greatly motivated to do what He commanded, according to his thought [of what that was]. And due to this he got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey to carry the wood of the Olah, lead two youths along with him and Yitzchak his son, split the wood of the Olah and placed them on the donkey, and got up to go to the place that Hashem, the All-Powerful, had said to him.
The first benefit is in regards to beliefs.
The second benefit is in regards to beliefs [as well].

Chapter 23



Verse 1




And when they arose in the morning, the servant said to them that they should send him away to his master and give him Rebecca, and he would take her to Issac. And behold, Bethuel did not refuse this, but her brother and her mother said - from their imaginary great love that they had for her - that it was fit that the maiden should dwell with them a year or ten months, to fill her eyes with seeing the people of her father's house, and her family and then leave. Indeed, they said this because she was going to a very faraway land, and it would not be likely that she would return to see the household of her father. So the slave besought them that they not delay him from returning to his master... And when they saw this, they said that they would ask the maiden, if she would agree to go with him. And when they asked her, she said that she would already go with him, and that the separation would not be difficult in her eyes.

Exodus



Chapter 1



Verse 1








The third purpose is regarding character traits: That is not fit for a person to do very repulsive acts - even if he is obligated and commanded to do them by his ruler. Rather it is fit that he fear more from God, may He be blessed, who rules over his ruler than he fear from his ruler...
And the fourth purpose is [also] regarding character traits, and it is that it is not fit for a person to rely upon a miracle [to protect him] if he did something out of the fear of God. Rather it is fit that he makes efforts with all of his might to distance the evil that may happen to him because of this act...

The nineteenth purpose is regarding prohibitions. And it is to remember that which we were prohibited that an Israelite apostate not eat from the Passover sacrifice. For we were commanded the Passover sacrifice in order to make us acquire perfect faith in the Lord, may He be blessed. So it is not fitting for one to eat it, who will not have this become perfect. And for this reason, we were prohibited that a resident alien and a hired hand may not eat of it, as they have not entered into our faith. Likewise one uncircumcised, as he has not fully entered into our faith. For [it is] the first commandment that someone who is of our faith will seize upon to be commanded by it. And it is also the commandment that Abraham was commanded in order to come to perfection, in such a way that [his descendants] would receive the Torah and inherit the Land, as we explained in Parshat Lech Lecha. And this is the reason that the Torah is stringent about this here. And for this reason we were also prohibited regarding one upon whom there are [others] that require circumcision - such as his small sons or slaves that are purchased by money or born within his household - that have not been circumcised; he may not eat from or perform the Passover sacrifice. [This is] because they have not fully entered into our faith, as they have already treated this first commandment lightly.

Verse 1



...Whoever ascribes divinity to anything besides Me, I will punish that one who hates Me and practices idolatry with a wondrous punishment - that the children of the sinner will be punished for this iniquity, [as well as] the third and fourth generations. And as a result, it is fitting that people guard themselves from idolatry. However for the one who loves Me and guards My commandments in such a way as to cling to Me, I will do wondrous kindness - the kindness will continue upon his offspring for thousands of generations. But behold, there is a question about this statement. And that is, how is it possible that God, may He be blessed, would punish the children of a sinner; as behold, they have no guilt for the sin of their father?? And we answer this question in this way. And it is that the punishment that God brings upon those that transgress His words - whether it be by providence, whether it be by rebuke or whether it by the secret of providence, such that the proper punishments come upon them through the system [of the constellations] - that when He brings these woes, the woe reaches their children. But it would not have reached them were it not for the sins of their parents. And the [illustration of this is] when our ancestors rebelled, they were liable for the punishment that they would be exiled among the nations, and gentiles would inherit their land. But behold the exile continues to their children after them, because of their being exiled when they gave birth to them. [It is] such that it is not possible for them to escape from this woe unless... they be at the heights of perfection, such that it is possible that God would bring them out by way of a miracle. And it is in this way that the prophet said (Lamentations 5:7), "Our fathers sinned and are no more; and we must bear their guilt." And that is because if our fathers had not sinned, we would be in the Land... But behold, when we are in exile for the sin of our fathers, guarding ourselves from disgusting acts (which caused the exile) is insufficient to have us return [to the Land]. Rather, we are required to attain [greater] perfection, such that we cling to God, may He be elevated, in such a way that He would take us out of the exile by way of wondrous providence. And in this way, there would be no injustice if the punishment would reach the children for the sake of the parents, as this is through happenstance...

Verse 2

The portion of "Rashei Hamatot"
And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, "Take vengeance for the children of Israel against the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
However, the benefits derived from this portion are twofold.
<b>The first benefit</b> is regarding the commandments, which entail that one should not violate their vows or break their oaths. Instead, they should fulfill everything that comes from their mouth. In this, there are two commandments: one is a negative commandment, prohibiting the violation of vows, and the other is a positive commandment, instructing the fulfillment of one's verbal commitments. The benefit of these commandments is evident, as if it were permissible for a person to profane their words, it would lead to a laxity in their faith in the Almighty. This is similar to the rationale behind the prohibition of false oaths, as it prevents the distortion of the ethical principles that guide human interactions. Moreover, there is an additional benefit, as through these commandments, a person is encouraged to exert more effort in performing good deeds. If one were to annul their own vows, the benefit of these actions would be diminished.
The second benefit is related to the commandments and pertains to the legal proceedings concerning the annulment of vows. This applies to cases involving a man and his wife, a father and his daughter during her youth, or the household of her father. The benefit of this commandment is evident, as without it, there would be constant discord and conflict between husbands and wives or fathers and daughters due to the binding nature of vows and oaths. Women, due to their more sensitive nature, are particularly prone to being affected by these vows and oaths. Therefore, the Torah provided a solution to address this potential discord by allowing for the annulment of vows within a certain timeframe. This allows the husband or father to reconsider the matter and, if it is a source of anger or conflict, the annulment can be performed promptly. This gives the opportunity for the anger to subside and for a resolution to be reached within a day, based on the customary practices of most people.

The benefits that stem from it are twelve.
<b>The first benefit</b> is to highlight the great diligence of Moses in performing the commandments of the Almighty, even though he knew that afterwards he would gather his people for war. He did not hesitate to take swift action and exact revenge according to what was possible.
<b>The second benefit</b> is to demonstrate that the righteous are not afraid of death, as they do not greatly value the physical life. Their ultimate goal is to enjoy the intellectual attainments they have acquired, even if it means sacrificing their lives. By constantly pursuing intellectual pursuits, which they have acquired, they can always derive pleasure from the attainment of these intellectual pursuits. Therefore, Moses did not fear death in this situation or in any other situation. Rather, he asked the Almighty to appoint a leader over the congregation who would diligently guide them, as his intention was solely to continue drawing from the good in his lifetime for the benefit of the people.
<b>The third benefit</b> is to make known what happened as a result of Divine Providence in this war. Although the enemies came against the Israelites in small numbers, they were able to infiltrate their camps and fortresses and kill many of them. None of the soldiers from the Israelite army were spared, and the casualties were numerous. Even young boys and women who were still virgins, having no knowledge of intimate relations, were among the thirty-two thousand who were killed. Furthermore, the success in this battle was so great that even Balaam, the son of Beor, was killed in it. If he had survived, he might have attempted to harm the Israelites.
<b>The fourth benefit</b> is to publicize the manifestation of God's great love for the Israelites. By making it known that the Midianites were punished, the Israelites would fully understand the measures they should take to avoid being influenced by their enticing ways. When the Israelites relied on divine providence, they could clearly see how harmful the remaining people of Midian were to them, as evidenced in the book of Judges. Their behavior had a more detrimental impact on the Israelites compared to other nations who ruled over them. Therefore, the commandment was given to kill all the adult males, while sparing the young boys. This was done to prevent any potential stumbling block concerning the inheritance of the land. By uniting with the entire Israelite community, the Israelites would be safeguarded against the sin of those who were naturally inclined toward their harmful practices. Furthermore, this was also the reason why God commanded the obliteration of the memory of Amalek. From the small remnant that was left, such as Haman, the son of Agag, one could see the danger they posed to the Israelites' spiritual well-being. Similarly, the commandment to kill the Midianite women, known for their involvement in immoral behavior, was to prevent the Israelites from being led astray from the path of God.
The fifth benefit is to publicly acknowledge the integrity of the soldiers who fought in the battle. Not a single person among them concealed any of the spoils of war. They brought everything before Moses, the leaders, and the entire congregation, as if they were proclaiming their honesty and sincerity. Their upright hearts demonstrated that they considered the spoils of war as belonging to God, and this immense success in the battle was granted to them due to their righteousness.
The sixth benefit is related to character traits, and it is to make known that the one who initiates a good deed is deserving of completing that deed until its fulfillment. In this regard, it is mentioned that Pinchas was the leader in this battle because he was the one who initiated avenging God's honor against Midian by killing Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, who had come to seduce the Israelites into immorality. This act also served as a cause for stopping the plague from the people of Israel by God. Therefore, God desired that Pinchas should have the privilege of leading this battle, which was intended to exact revenge on behalf of God against Midian and to save Israel from the harm they were destined to endure, as much as possible.
The seventh benefit is to publicize that there is no power in sorcery that can determine what will be required by divine providence in future events. Therefore, it is mentioned that Balak, the son of Beor, was mentioned, as even though he was a sorcerer, he did not have prior knowledge in this matter to take advice to save himself when he left those places that corrupted the Israelites.
The eighth benefit is to publicize that God had already repaid Balak for the wickedness of his heart by giving him advice to cause Israel to stumble in matters of immorality and idolatry, so that the anger of God would be kindled against them and bring them to destruction.
The ninth benefit is to make known that those who have received good from God should recognize Him and express gratitude to Him, for in this lies the benefit of what should not be concealed. Therefore, the officers and the soldiers willingly contributed many golden vessels to the name of God as a token of gratitude for all the goodness He had bestowed upon them. Not a single person among the warriors was exempted. For this reason, Moses brought them to the Tent of Meeting to preserve this wonderful example. Additionally, God commanded that a portion of the spoils be taken as a contribution to the priests and Levites, in order to awaken in them the recognition of the wondrous and extraordinary goodness that had come to them from God, not by their own strength or power.
The tenth benefit is to make known that it is proper for every person to refrain from doing something that might cause others to stumble. Thus, when the tribes of Gad and Reuben requested their portion of the land east of the Jordan, Moses and the people of Israel questioned their intention. They feared that this request might discourage the rest of the Israelites from fully inheriting the land beyond the Jordan. This concern arose because they thought that Gad and Reuben had chosen this land for themselves in order to avoid fighting alongside their brethren. However, when they agreed to go and fight alongside their fellow Israelites, even though they had no personal benefit from their request, it demonstrated that they were willing to prioritize the unity and welfare of the entire nation over their own convenience. This showed their trust in God's promise to subdue the nations before them. Thus, they entered into this battle with the understanding that it was for the greater good and not for their personal gain.
The eleventh benefit is in matters of negotiation, and it is to convey that it is appropriate for every person to clarify the details of a business agreement with others in a way that eliminates any possibility of deceit or trickery. In this regard, Moses, peace be upon him, was meticulous in setting conditions with the tribes of Gad and Reuben and elaborating on the terms to ensure that there would be no room for deception or dishonesty.
The twelfth benefit is in matters of character traits, and it is that it is not fitting for a person to prioritize personal benefits over the collective welfare. One should not choose one matter over another unless there is a comprehensive settlement. For example, it can be observed that due to the extensive cattle holdings of the tribes of Gad and Reuben, they were inclined to choose the land east of the Jordan, which was suitable for grazing. However, they realized the potential negative consequences this might have on their commitment to follow the path of the Lord. Therefore, they had to construct the altar mentioned in the Book of Joshua to demonstrate their loyalty and to dispel any doubts that they might deviate from the worship of the Lord. They were even more willing to face the dangers and fight alongside the other tribes of Israel, despite the fact that they possessed considerable wealth. It can also be seen that the first exiles carried away by the king of Assyria were precisely those tribes, as the Moabites were a constant source of anguish and harm to them due to their close proximity and the territories they had acquired from the Gadites and Reubenites through the defeat of Sihon, as described in the words of Jephthah the Gileadite.

Chapter 33



Verse 1

Parashat Maasei
These are the journeys of the children of Israel and their total number until the end of the portion.
However, the benefits that come from it are fifteen.
<b>The first benefit</b> is to provide additional details to what the Torah has recorded about the journeys of our ancestors in the wilderness for forty years. By recounting their travels, it clarifies how each journey unfolded, as many authentic accounts have already added to the truth of those details.
<b>The second benefit</b> is to demonstrate the power of the wondrous acts of the Almighty and the fulfillment of His promises. Despite the fact that, in every Egyptian household, there was death and they knew that this calamity befell them because of the Israelites, nevertheless, God, in His great favor, granted the Israelites favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. The Egyptians willingly bestowed upon them their most valuable possessions, taking advantage of the Israelites. Yet, despite all this, the Israelites departed from Egypt triumphantly, with the Egyptians burying their firstborn children.
The third benefit is to make known that the Almighty, in His desire to bring the Israelites closer to His service, led them easily to believe in Him. He first brought them to a place where they couldn't find water, so that they would recognize the kindness of the Almighty when He provided them with water. Then He led them to the place of Marah, where the water was bitter, and later brought them to a place with an abundance of water, to demonstrate that His goodness was not only limited, as some of Pharaoh's advisors had assumed. This is why Pharaoh said, "See, evil is before you," as we explained in the portion of Va'eira.
<b>The fourth benefit</b> is what we learned from the juxtaposition of the death of the Canaanite king to the death of Aaron. The death of a righteous person makes an impression, and therefore it is appropriate for people to be concerned about the passing of righteous individuals.
<b>The fifth benefit</b> is related to the commandments. We were commanded to eliminate idolatry and its worship from our land, and to remove from there the worshippers of foreign gods. For if they were allowed to remain, they would become thorns in our eyes and snares in our sides, leading Israel astray and enticing them to worship foreign gods.
The sixth benefit is derived from the mention of the boundaries of the land of Canaan, encompassing all its sides. This serves as a reminder that Israel should not neglect their efforts to fully conquer it.
The seventh benefit is to inform that despite Moses being punished and not being allowed to cross the Jordan, he still provided the specific boundaries for the inheritance of the land. Through his words, the Lord determined who would inherit the land of Israel, which land would be given to them, and which cities would be designated for the Levites. Joshua also followed this guidance in the matter of conquering and possessing the land, as described in the Book of Joshua through a closer examination.
The eighth benefit is related to the commandments, specifically the regulation of the cities of refuge, the cities of the Levites, and the allocation of their surrounding fields. The benefit of the cities of refuge is evident, as they provided a place of escape for someone who unintentionally caused another person's death. Therefore, it was necessary to have a prepared and accessible refuge available at all times. It was important to clearly mark the paths leading to these cities so that anyone passing by would know which way to go in case they needed to reach a city of refuge. Furthermore, the high priest's death marked the end of the period of refuge for the accidental killer, as the avenger of blood would no longer pursue them after the death of the high priest. The benefit of allocating specific cities to the Levites was twofold. Firstly, by providing them with cities, the Levites could dedicate themselves to the service of the Lord and focus on the secrets of the Torah. Secondly, it was important for the Levites to have suitable accommodations that were not deteriorated or damaged, as their role was connected to intellectual pursuits and spiritual guidance.
The ninth benefit is to emphasize the value of upright justice as desired by the Torah. It states that if a resident accidentally kills an Israelite, they will be exempt from the death penalty but must seek refuge in a designated city, similar to the case of intentional murder. This highlights the principle of fair treatment and demonstrates that even in cases of unintentional harm, there are consequences and responsibilities. The concept of seeking refuge in a designated city ensures both the protection of the individual who caused the accidental death and the preservation of justice within the community.
The tenth benefit is related to the commandments, specifically the commandment to execute a murderer based on the testimony of witnesses and the decision of the Israelite court (Sanhedrin). The execution should only be carried out through the authorized judicial process and not through any other means. The rationale behind this is explained in previous discussions.
The eleventh benefit pertains to the commandments. It is about the warning given to witnesses not to testify falsely against a murderer. We have already mentioned the reason for this in our previous discussion. However, in order to give the accused the benefit of the doubt, his defense should be heard, not in terms of his testimony regarding the act itself, but rather as a counterargument to the witnesses' testimony. Furthermore, since it is fitting to ensure that the death penalty is not imposed on him outside the proper jurisdiction, it is appropriate to hear the arguments of all those who advocate for his acquittal, in order to safeguard against the sin of unjustly taking a person's life. From this, it becomes clear that if the murderer himself claims to have a legitimate defense, his arguments should be heard, and if the judges see merit in his words, they should acquit him.
The twelfth benefit pertains to the commandments. It is about the commandment to impose exile on a person who unintentionally kills another. In this, there is a wondrous benefit in causing people to be extremely cautious not to engage in any action that could potentially lead to unintentional manslaughter. The fear of being subject to the lengthy exile, which lasts until the death of the High Priest, serves as a powerful deterrent against the possibility of causing accidental loss of life.
The thirteenth benefit pertains to the commandments. It is about the commandment that warns us not to accept any ransom or monetary compensation to exempt a murderer from punishment, whether it be from capital punishment or exile. Even though the Torah allows for monetary compensation in the case of an ox causing accidental death, this specific commandment serves to emphasize the great benefit of this warning. As we have explained in our commentary on this portion, the Torah explicitly mentions this commandment to highlight its importance.
The fourteenth benefit relates to beliefs and it is to inform us that sins cause the withdrawal of divine providence from those individuals who engage in those sins. We have already explained the reason behind this in our commentary on the portion of Korah.
The fifteenth benefit pertains to principles and it is to inform us that when necessity demands a deduction from a person's rightful portion for the benefit of another, it is proper that everything we can do with integrity to restore that deduction should be done in a way that it will never be deducted from it again. We should do it to the best of our ability without causing harm to the one to whom this statute and rule applies. This is exemplified by the fact that the inheritance of Zelophehad's daughters was deducted from the inheritance of the sons of Hepher, which could have been avoided by arranging it in a way that their inheritance would never be deducted from them, without causing harm to the daughters of Zelophehad. This could be achieved by their marrying within their own tribe, as the Torah desired that they marry their cousins after considering that they would not be harmed by this arrangement.
Here concludes the explanation from this book, which has been completed in a very short time and without the need for additional books. Therefore, it will be necessary for the reader to review it once again. Its completion took place on the 23rd of the month of Tevet in the year 5786, with praise and gratitude to the Almighty who assisted us. May He bless and elevate His name above all blessing and praise. Amen, amen.
And thus, the book of statutes and the banners of the armies is completed. To God, the Lord of hosts, be praise and gratitude. May He, in His mercy, cleanse us from all hidden faults and errors, and may He show us wondrous things from His Torah. May it be His will, amen.

Verse 1



















The sixteenth benefit is to inform that it is not appropriate to mourn for a person more than is necessary - even if he was of the greatest possible stature. Do you not see that in spite of our teacher Moses' being of great stature in governance and greatness, the Torah only condoned that the days of weeping for him should be thirty days, like the days of the weeping for Aaron.
