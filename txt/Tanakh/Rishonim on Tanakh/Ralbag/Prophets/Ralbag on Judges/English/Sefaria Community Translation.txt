Verse 3



Verse 4

And here it was that Devorah judged Israel. And I think because [it is written] "at that time" that when Israel returned to God she would judge them. And she made the rounds so that they would return to God because when [God seemed] far [from them] Israel would do evil in the eyes of God. And Devorah would not rebuke them about this. And she was a prophet. Here it also points to what we said: [The text] said "she judged Israel at that time" [i.e. she would only sit in judgment when they had returned to God]. And it called her "a wife of Lappidoth" because her husband was named Barak [lightning] and lightning and flame are close in concept or there will be a translation of "eishet lappidoth" according to phrasing of a Woman of Valor that she was a fiery woman [?], and "torches" [lappidim, cf Exodus 20:15] and "Lappidoth" are one conceptually. [But] the purpose in it [the expression] is that the vastness of [?] prophecy had already arrived to the extent that torches were seen in the place at which a prophetic message arrived to her, as it is said in the Torah regarding our Teacher our Rabbi (may peace be upon him) [i.e. Moshe, cf Mekhilta 20:15 (2)].
