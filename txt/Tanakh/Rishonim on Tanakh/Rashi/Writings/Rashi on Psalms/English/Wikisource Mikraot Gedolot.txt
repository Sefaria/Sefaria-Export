Rashi on Psalms



Chapter 1



Verse 1

With ten languages of song was this book said: with nitzuakh, with niggun, with mizmor, with shir, with hallel, with t'fillah, with b'rakhah, with hoda'ah, with ashre, with hallelujah, corresponding to the ten persons who said it: Adam, Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Asaph and the three sons of Korah. And they differ on Jeduthun: there are those who say he was a man as it is written in I Chronicles 16:38, and there are those who say, Jeduthun that is in this book only refers to the laws and the judgments of the decrees which have gone over him and over Israel.
Les felicements in the foreign language; the contentment of man and his praises are these, that he did not go; for since he did not go, he did not stand; and since he did stand, he did not sit.
