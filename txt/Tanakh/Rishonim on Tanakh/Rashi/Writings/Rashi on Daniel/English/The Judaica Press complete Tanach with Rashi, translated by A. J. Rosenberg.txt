Rashi on Daniel



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim</b> Now is it possible to say so? Did he [Nebuchadnezzar] not reign in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as is stated (Jer. 25:1) “in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah that is the first year of Nebuchadnezzar?” So what is the meaning of “In the third year?” In the third year of his rebellion, as is stated (II Kings 24:1): “and Jehoiakim was his vassal for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him”; and in the third year, he overcame him, and that was the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar, for the master said (Seder Olam ch. 24): In his first year he conquered Nineveh, and in his second year he advanced and vanquished Jehoiakim, who served him for three years and rebelled against him for three years. That was the eleventh year of the reign of Jehoiakim: five years before he vanquished him, three years that he served him, and three years that he rebelled against him. And then Jehoiakim died under his hand, and in his stead, Nebuchadnezzar enthroned Jehoiachin, his son.

Verse 2

<b>and some of the vessels of the House of God</b> he took, and some of them remained, as is stated (in Jeremiah 27:19): “so has the Lord of Hosts said concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels, which Nebuchadnezzar did not take into exile (sic).”
<b>and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god</b> to praise his idols; he brought the entire captivity there, even the people, and the vessels he brought afterwards to the treasury.

Verse 3

<b>the nobles</b> Heb. הַפַּרְתְּמִים, dukes.

Verse 4

<b>and who have strength</b> Our Sages explained (Sanh. 93b) that they should restrain themselves from laughing, speaking and sleeping, out of fear of the throne, and resist the urge when they feel the need to relieve themselves.
<b>and to teach them the script</b> This refers back to “who have strength.”

Verse 5

<b>allotted</b> Heb. וַיְמַן, an expression of preparation.
<b>of... food</b> Heb. מִפַּת־בַּג. That is the name of the king’s fare in the language of the Chaldeans. Some interpret פַּת־בַּג, [as] bread, but it does not appear correct, for it is written (below verse 16): “The steward would take away פַּת־בָּגָם... and give them pulse.” Now pulse is not a substitute for bread, but a substitute for cooked food.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>Belteshazzar</b> He named him after the god of Babylon, which was called Bel, as it is said (4: 5): “whose name is Belteshazzar, like the name of my god.” Teshazzar is the Aramaic expression denoting wisdom.

Verse 8

<b>not to be defiled</b> Heb. לֹא יָתְגָּאַל, an expression of sullying.

Verse 9

<b>the chief officer</b> who was the chief over the king’s servants.

Verse 10

<b>who allotted</b> who prepared and provided.
<b>like you</b> כְּגִילְכֶם, of your likeness. It is the language of the Mishnah; one of his likeness.
<b>and you will forfeit my head to the king</b> You shall bring about that I will be condemned to be beheaded.

Verse 11

<b>the steward</b> Heb. הַמֶּלְצַר, the one who arranges the portions and the plates, called maestre sala, seneschal, steward.

Verse 12

<b>test</b> Heb. נַס an expression of (נִסָיוֹן) testing.
<b>some pulse</b> a type of beans instead of the food.

Verse 13

<b>and as you will see</b> According to what you see, do.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>carry away their food</b> He would take it for himself.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>that the king ordered to bring them</b> that they come before him.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>the necromancers</b> These are the ones who inquire of טִימֵי מֵתִים, the bones of the dead, as you say, “May his bones be crushed,” שְּׁחִיק טַמַיָא.
<b>the astrologers</b> These are the ones who “press” the constellation. So it is explained in Tanhuma (Miketz 2, Buber, Miketz 4).

Verse 21

<b>And Daniel was there</b> in greatness in Babylon until the first year of King Cyrus. According to the one who says that Hathach (Esther; 4:5, 6, 9, 10) is Daniel; and why was he called Hathach? Because he was cut off (חֲתָכוּהוּ) from his greatness; [according to his explanation] we must say that this is Cyrus I, who preceded Ahasuerus. But according to the one who says that all royal affairs were decided (נֶחְתָּכִים) by his orders, we must say that this Cyrus was Darius II, [who came] after Ahasuerus, and in the days of Darius the Mede, when they cast [Daniel] into the lions’ den, he was not demoted from his greatness, as it is said (6:29): “And this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and during the reign of Cyrus the Persian.” We learn that during the days of Cyrus I he was [still] in his greatness.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign</b> It is impossible to say this, except that [it happened] in the second year after the destruction of the Temple. So it is taught in Seder Olam (ch. 28), and Scripture called it “of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign,” because he demonstrated his insolence by entering the Inner Sanctum of the Sovereign of the Universe.
<b>and his spirit was troubled</b> Heb. וַתִּתְפָּעֶם רוּחוֹ. Concerning Pharaoh it says (Gen. 41:8): וַתִּפָּעֶם רוּחוֹ, for only the interpretation of the dream was hidden from him, but here, since the dream too was hidden from him, the expression is doubled: וַתִּתְפָּעֶם, an expression of pulsating and beating.
<b>was interrupted</b> Heb. נִהְיְתָה, an expression of breaking like (Ezek. 7:25): “Breach upon breach (הוָה עַל הוָה).”

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>May the king live forever</b> Aram. מַלְכָּא לְעָלְמִין חֱיִי.
<b>Tell your servants the dream</b> [as translated,] Tell your servants the dream.

Verse 5

<b>The matter has escaped me</b> The thing has left me.
<b>If you do not let me know the dream and its meaning</b> [as translated,] if you do not let me know the dream and its meaning.
<b>you shall be torn limb from limb</b> Aram. הַדָמִין תִּתְעַבְּדוּן. You shall be cut to pieces, and there are many such in the Gemara (Gittin 67b): “Arrange the cuts” (הַדוּמֵי הַדְמּוּהָ).
<b>a dungheap</b> Aram. נְוָלִי, a dungheap.
<b>shall be made</b> Aram. יִתְּשָּׂמוּן an expression of וְיָשֵּׂם, and he will make. They shall be made into dungheaps.

Verse 6

<b>But if</b> [as translated,] But if.
<b>and lavish presents</b> [as translated,] presents.
<b>but</b> [as translated,] but.
<b>tell me</b> [as translated,] tell me.

Verse 7

<b>a second time</b> [as translated,] a second time.
<b>we shall tell</b> [as translated,] we shall tell.

Verse 8

<b>in truth, I know</b> [as translated,] in truth, I know.
<b>truth</b> Aram. יַצִיב, a true and permanent thing.
<b>that this time you are doomed</b> Aram. דִּי עִדָּנָא אַנְתוּן זַבְנִין, that this time you are delivered to death.
<b>because you see</b> because you see that the matter escaped me, but you repeatedly ask me to tell you.

Verse 9


<b>or if you have prepared yourselves...a false and corrupt word</b> Or if you have prepared yourselves to say before me a false and corrupt word.
<b>until the time changes</b> until the time changes, i.e., before the shadows of evening slant, when the time of morning changes.
“Until the time changes” is an expression of rebuke and an exaggeration: so will he be punished, and the punishment was already delineated above. A similar instance is (Gen. 4:15): “Therefore, whoever kills Cain.”
<b>but</b> the dream; tell me what I dreamed, and I shall know that you will surely tell me the interpretation.

Verse 10

<b>who...the king’s word</b> who will be able to tell the king’s word.
<b>because</b> Aram. כָּל קַבֵל, lit. all opposite; i.e., our reply is true, in view of the fact that there was never a king who asked anything like this.
<b>such a thing</b> Aram. מִלָה כִדְּנָה, a thing like this.
<b>astrologer</b> who presses the constellation.

Verse 11

<b>difficult</b> Aram. יַקִירָה, heavy, and its burden is heavy.
<b>and there is no other who can tell it</b> and there is no other who will tell it.
<b>but the angels</b> but the angels whose dwelling is not with flesh and blood.
<b>whose dwelling</b> Aram. מְדָרְהוֹן, their dwelling. The Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (ad loc.) [says]: וְאַחֲרָן לָא אִיתַי, and Aaron is not here. A priest who wears the Urim and Tummim is not here to tell you. He said to them, “That Temple was so powerful, and you advised me to destroy it?” Immediately, he became angry and commanded to slay them.

Verse 12

<b>In view of this</b> in view of this reply.
<b>in great wrath and anger</b> Aram. מַלְכָּא בְּנַס וּקְצַף שַּׂגִיא. The king was in great wrath and anger.
(בְּנַס) means in wrath. (Gen. 40:6): “And behold they were angry (זעַפִים), and Onkelos renders: נסִיסִין.
<b>and ordered to destroy</b> Aram. וַאֲמַר לְהוֹבָדָה. About this “vav” of וַאֲמַר, Menahem and Dunash disputed. Menahem (p. 46) forced himself to make the “beth” of בְּנַס, a radical and did not interpret בְּנַס וּקְצַף as nouns, but as an expression of a verb: was greatly wroth and angry and ordered to destroy. The “vav” in וַאֲמַר forced him to interpret it this way. Dunash (p. 9) says that it is impossible for the “beth” to be a radical, but it is a noun, and he interpreted it in this manner: with great wrath and anger he ordered to destroy, and the “vav” there is superfluous, like the “vav” of (Ps. 76:7): “chariot (וְרֶכֶב) and horse.” But I say that the “vav” is not forced to be superfluous, but so is its interpretation: מַלְכָּא בְּנַס וּקְצַף שַּׂגִּיא, the king was in great wrath and anger, and he ordered in his wrath to destroy them. Accordingly, this is an elliptical verse.

Verse 13

<b>And a decree was issued</b> The law of the king and his decree were issued in the province.
<b>and Daniel and his colleagues were sought to be slain</b> [as translated,] and Daniel and his colleagues were sought to be slain.

Verse 14

<b>Then</b> Aram. בֵּאדַיִן, the Targum for אָז.
<b>answered with counsel and good sense</b> He answered [with] counsel and good sense to Arioch, the name of the man.
<b>the...chief executioner</b> the officer over those who executed the ones condemned to death.

Verse 15

<b>Why was the decree issued so hastily</b> Why is the decree of the king [issued] in such a haste to kill?
<b>Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel</b> that the king was angry because no one told him his dream.

Verse 16

<b>entered and requested</b> [as translated,] entered and requested.
<b>be given him</b> [as translated,] be given him.

Verse 37

<b>The King of kings</b> Our Sages, of blessed memory, explained (Shev. 35b): Every mention of “king” in Daniel refers to an earthly king, except this one, which he said in reference to the Holy One, blessed be He, and this is what it means: The King of kings, Who is the God of heaven.
<b>a strong... kingdom</b> gave you a strong and prominent kingdom.

Verse 38

<b>and has given you dominion over them all</b> And He gave you dominion over them all, so that even if you decree upon a horse, it will not whinny, or upon a bird, it will not fly, as it is said (Jer. 27: 6): “and even the beasts of the field I have given to him to serve him.”

Verse 39

<b>And after you will arise another kingdom lower than you</b> And after you, after the reign of your son, Belshazzar, will arise a kingdom that will take the ruling power from your seed, lower and humbler than your kingdom.
<b>lower</b> Aram. אֶרַע, lower, as silver is lower and humbler than gold, and you saw that the breast, which is after the head, was of silver; so will the kingdom of Media and Persia, which will follow the kingdom of Babylon, be humbler than the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar.
<b>and another, a third kingdom</b> [as translated,] another.
<b>of copper</b> as strong as copper, and that is the kingdom of Alexander of Macedon.

<b>crumbles and flattens everything</b> flattens and crumbles all kinds of metal, which are flattened with a hammer.
<b>and flattens</b> Aram. וְחָשֵּׁל, and flattens. There are many such [words] in the Talmud. Keth. 77a, “who thins copper for kettles (חַשְּׁלָא דוּדֵי)”; Hul. 93a: “crushed testicles (בֵּיעֵי חֳשִּׁלָתָא).”

<b>in the plain of Dura</b> the name of a place.

<b>at that time</b> At the time that they hear the sound of the music, which is a sign that those who prostrate themselves should come to prostrate, all peoples would fall etc.

Verse 8

<b>In view of this</b> in view of this, that their enemies saw that there is a time to denounce them.
<b>some Chaldean men approached and denounced</b> Aram. וַאֲכַלוּ קַרְצֵיהוֹן informed about them. (Lev. 19: 16) “Do not go as a talebearer among your people,” is translated by Targum as קוּרצִין לָא תֵיכוּ I say that it was the custom of talebearers to eat a meal in the place where they informed, and that was a sign of the verification of their words; for at that time it was incumbent upon them to clarify their words and to verify the slander that they spoke, and that meal was called eating קוּרצִין, an expression of (Prov. 6:13) “he winks (קוֹרֵץ) with his eyes,” which is a sign of slander.

Verse 9

<b>They spoke up and said</b> Aram. עֲנוֹ, they shouted. Every [expression of] עֲנִיָה in Scriptures is an expression of raising the voice.

Verse 13

<b>ordered to bring</b> [as translated,] ordered to bring.
<b>were brought</b> [as translated,] were brought.

Verse 14

<b>Is it meaningless</b> Aram. הַצְדָא. Are my decrees void and desolate and an empty thing in your eyes, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not worship my god? The “hey” of הַצְדָא is used as an interrogative expression.
<b>that I have set up</b> [as translated,] that I have set up.

Verse 15

<b>Now, behold you are destined</b> Now, behold you are destined against your will to accept this upon yourselves.

<b>and who is a god</b> and who is a god who will save you from my hands?

<b>to the king, ‘Nebuchadnezzar</b> Why is his name mentioned? But this is what they said to him: “If [it concerns] taking upon ourselves to pay taxes, either the tax from the crops or the head taxes, you are king over us, [but] if [it concerns] denying the Holy One, blessed be He, [you are merely] Nebuchadnezzar.

<b>seven times as much as it should be heated</b> instead of once, seven times as much as they calculated to heat it up; and it was as though they would kindle it seven times as much as it required.
<b>to be heated</b> lit. to heat it.

Verse 20

<b>certain mighty men in his army</b> [as translated,] certain mighty men in his army.
<b>And he commanded...to bind</b> He commanded to bind them because he saw that they were strengthening themselves to answer him harshly, and he said, “These are mighty”; so he commanded the mighty men in his army to bind them.

Verse 21

<b>these men</b> [as translated,] these men.
<b>were bound in their cloaks</b> They were bound in the garments in which they enwrapped themselves.
<b>their trousers, their robes</b> types of royal raiment that they had; and although they were going forth to be judged before Nebuchadnezzar regarding their death sentence, they did not change their clothes to humble their greatness. From here the Sages learned that even in times of danger, a person should not change from the ruling position to which he has become accustomed.
<b>their robes</b> Aram. וְכַרְבְּלָתְהוֹן. There is a word similar to this (in I Chron. 15: 27): “And David was clothed (מְכֻרְבָּל).

<b>and there is no wound upon them</b> [as translated,] and there is no wound upon them.
<b>and the form of the fourth</b> [as translated,] and the form of the fourth.
<b>is like [that of] an angel</b> It is like the angel I saw when I was with Sannecherib, when his armies were burned, as it is said (II Kings 19: 35): “[And an angel of the Lord went forth] and slew...of the camp of Assyria.” And Nebuchadnezzar was there and fled among the ten who fled from them.

Verse 26

<b>approached the gate of the... fiery furnace</b> He approached the gate of the court, in which the furnace was situated, to speak with them, and at first, he saw them from afar.
<b>Step out and come</b> “step out and come,” but he did not say to them, “step out and ascend.” From here we learn that the floor of the furnace floated up and became even with the ground, so that they should not be troubled to go up.
<b>Then...came out</b> Although they were confident of the miracle that had been performed for them, they did not dare to treat the king lightly, to go out without permission.

Verse 27

<b>And the satraps...gathered</b> Four nations were counted above in the first gathering who were not counted here: Adargazeria, Dethaveria, Gedaveria, Tiftaei. They are the mighty men whom the spark of fire had killed when they cast Hananiah and his colleagues into the fire.

<b>until a time, two times, and half a time</b> This is an obscure end, as was said to Daniel (12:4): “And you, Daniel, close up the words and seal,” and the early commentators expounded on it, each one according to his view, and the ends have passed. We can still interpret it as I saw written in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon, that they are the 1,335 years stated at the end of the Book (12:12): “Fortunate is he who waits [and reaches the days one thousand three hundred and thirty-five],” and he explains the appointed time as until the time of two times and a half time, and he [Rav Saadia Gaon] said that the times are 480 [years], which is the time from the Exodus from Egypt until the Temple was built, and 410 [years], [which are] the days of the First Temple, totaling 890, and another half of this time, 445, totaling 1, 335. Figure these from the time the daily sacrifice was discontinued until the daily sacrifice will be restored to its place; it was discontinued six years prior to the destruction, and there is somewhat of a proof in this Book. [See Rashi to 8:14.] Others bring further proof to this computation, namely that (Deut. 31:18): “And I, will hide My face” [the words] הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר add up in gematria to 1,335.

Verse 26

<b>And the judgment was established</b> And the judgment was established before Him.
<b>and they will remove his dominion</b> from heaven. They will remove the dominion and the rule of that kingdom.

Verse 27

<b>and obey</b> They will obey his command to execute it.

Verse 28

<b>until here</b> [as translated,] until here.
<b>my thoughts terrified me greatly</b> My thoughts were terrifying me greatly.
<b>and my colors changed</b> The appearance of my good looks and my features changed.
<b>I kept...in my heart</b> I hid in my heart.

Chapter 8



Verse 1

<b>In the third year</b> after the first vision that appeared to me in the beginning, i.e., the dream stated above (7:1), which appeared to him in the first year of Belshazzar.

Verse 2

<b>beside the river Ulai</b> beside the river named Ulai.

Verse 3

<b>and it had horns</b> symbolizing the kingdom of Persia and Media.
<b>and one was higher than the other</b> symbolizing the kingdom of Persia, which was greater than the kingdom of Media, for the kingdom of Media existed for only one year, as it says (9:1): “In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus of the seed of Media,” and we learned in Seder Olam (ch. 28): “We do not find any year ascribed to Media in the Holy Writ but this one only.”
<b>and the higher one sprouted last</b> This symbolizes that the kingdom of Media will precede the kingdom of Persia.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>I was pondering</b> I was contemplating it.
<b>a he goat</b> Heb. צְפִיר.
<b>and it did not touch the ground</b> He resembled one skipping in the air.
<b>a conspicuous horn</b> Heb. קֶרֶן חָזוּת, a large horn visible to the eye.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>and it fought with it</b> Heb. וַיִתְמַרְמַר אֵלָיו, and it fought with it. That is an expression of bitter (מַר) anger.

Verse 8

<b>an appearance of four</b> an appearance of four horns.

Verse 9

<b>And from one of them</b> and from one of these kingdoms.
<b>emerged a...horn</b> The kingdom of Titus emerged from it.
<b>small</b> A small and despised kingdom, as he calls it above one small horn, and that is in the manner of (Obad. 1:2): “...you are very despised.”
<b>and it became very great</b> Heb. וַתִּגְדַּל מְאֹד.
<b>to the south</b> That is Egypt, which is to the south of the land of Israel.
<b>and to the coveted land</b> Heb. הַצְבִי The land of Israel, called אֶרֶץ הַצְבִי, the coveted land [or the land of beauty] after the manner of (Jer. 3:19): “an inheritance of the beauty of hosts of nations.”

Verse 10

<b>until the host of heaven</b> They are Israel, who were compared to the stars.

Verse 11

<b>And until the Prince of the host</b> That is the Temple, which is the House of the Holy One, blessed be He, the Prince of the host. He blasphemed the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>and through him the daily sacrifice was removed</b> And through his troops and his armies, which he sent to Jerusalem, the daily sacrifice was abolished, for he sent there Nero Caesar, his general, as our Rabbis relate in Gittin (56a) and in Gorion.

Verse 12

<b>And a time will be given for the daily sacrifice</b> A set time will be given for the daily sacrifice to be discontinued because of transgression.
<b>And a time</b> Heb. וְצָבָא, time, like (Job 7:1): “Is not man on earth for a limited time (צָבָא)”?
<b>and it will cast truth to the earth</b> It humbled the Torah of truth.

Verse 13

<b>one holy one</b> one of the angels.
<b>and...said</b> that angel.
<b>to the anonymous</b> Heb. לַפַּלְמוֹנִי. This word is like two: פְּלוֹנִי אַלְמוֹנִי, and Jonathan ben Uziel translated it in the Book of Samuel (I 21: 3): “covered and hidden,” like (Deut. 17:8): “If a matter be hidden (יִפָּלֵא) from you.” אַלְמוֹנִי means a widower (אַלְמָן) without a name, [i.e., bereft of a name] for he [the angel] did not explain to him what he was and what his name was.
<b>to the anonymous one who was speaking</b> to the angel who was speaking and issuing decrees, viz. “And a set time will be given for the daily sacrifice because of transgression.”
<b>How long will be the vision</b> this [vision] which concerns the daily sacrifice, that it should be discontinued, and the silent abomination will be placed in its stead. The silent abomination is an idol worshipped by the pagans, which was like a mute stone, and so it is called in this Book in many places, as it says (12:11): “And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed and the silent abomination placed.”
<b>mute</b> Heb. שֹּׁמֵם, an expression of being mute and silenced, like (4:16): “was bewildered (אֶשְּׁתּוֹמַם) for awhile;” (Ezek. 3:15): “and I sat there seven days bewildered (מַשְּׁמִים) among them,” like one who is dumb.
<b>permitting the Sanctuary and the host to be trampled</b> to make the base of the Sanctuary and the host of heaven, which he cast down to the earth, to be a trampling for his feet, as is stated above (verse 10): “and it cast down to the ground some of the host and some of the stars.”
<b>the Sanctuary and the host</b> Heb. וְקֹדֶשּׁ וְצָבָא. The “vav” [of וְקֹדֶשּׁ] is superfluous, and there are many such instances in Scripture, e.g. (Ps. 76:7): “chariot (וָרֶכֶב) and horse were stunned,” and also, in the language of people, some speak that way.

Verse 14

<b>Until evening and morning, one thousand and three hundred</b> I saw an interpretation in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon for this matter, but it has already passed, and he interpreted further “until evening and morning,” that evening about which it says (Zech. 14:7): “and it shall come to pass that at eventide it shall be light,” and we are confident that our God’s word will stand forever; it will not be nullified. I say, however, that the עֶרֶב and בֹּקֶר stated here are a gematria, and there is support for this matter from two reasons: 1) that this computation should coincide with the other computation at the end of the Book, and 2) that Gabriel said to Daniel later on in this chapter (verse 26): “And the vision of the evening and the morning is true.” Now, if he had not hinted that the computation was doubtful, why did he repeat it to say that it was true? And the seer was commanded to close up and to seal the matter, and to him, too, the matter was revealed in a closed and sealed expression, but we will hope for the promise of our king for end after end, and when the end passes, it will be known that the expounder has erred in his interpretation, and the one who comes after him will search and expound in another manner. This can be interpreted [as follows]: namely, that עֶרֶב בֹּקֶר has the numerical value of 574, ע = 70; ר = 200; ב = 2; ב = 2; ק = 100; ר = 200. Added together, this equals 574; plus 2,300, we have 2,874.
<b>and the holy ones shall be exonerated</b> The iniquity of Israel shall be expiated to bring an end to the decrees of their being trodden upon and crumbled since they were exiled in their first exile to Egypt, until they will be redeemed and saved with a perpetual salvation by our king Messiah, and this computation terminates at the end of 1,290 years from the day the daily sacrifice was removed, and that is what is stated at the end of the Book (12:11): “And from the time the daily sacrifice is removed, and the silent abomination placed, will be 1,290 years,” and no more, for our king Messiah will come and remove the silent abomination. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction of the Second Temple, and an image was set up in the Heichal. Now that was the seventeenth day of Tammuz, when Apostomos burned the Torah, put an end to the daily sacrifice, and set up an image in the Heichal, as we learned in Tractate Ta’anith (26b), but for the six years that I mentioned, I have no explicit proof, but there is proof that the daily sacrifice was abolished less than a complete shemittah cycle before the destruction, for so did Daniel prophesy about Titus (9:27): “...and half the week of years [shemittah cycle] he will curtail sacrifice and meal-offering,” meaning that a part of the week of years before the destruction, sacrifices will be abolished. So it is explained below in this section. Let us return to the earlier matters, how the computation of “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred,” fits exactly with the time commencing from the descent to Egypt to terminate at the end of 1,290 years until the day that the daily sacrifice was abolished: 210 years they were in Egypt. 480 years transpired from the Exodus until the building of the Temple. 410 years the Temple existed. 70 years was the Babylonian exile. 420 years the Second Temple stood. 1,290 should be added until the end of days, totaling: 2,880. Subtract six years that the daily sacrifice was removed before the destruction, for Scripture counted 1,290 years only from the time that the daily sacrifice was removed. Here you have the computation of “evening and morning, and 2,300” added to the computation. Fortunate is he who waits and reaches the end of days 45 years over 1,290 [years]. We may say that the king Messiah will come according to the first computation, and he will subsequently be concealed from them for forty-five years. Rabbi Elazar HaKalir established (in the concluding poem of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): in the foundation of his song: six weeks of years, totaling 42. We may say that the three years that did not total a week of years he did not count. And I found it so in Midrash Ruth that the king Messiah is destined to be concealed for forty-five years after he reveals himself, and proof is brought from these verses.

Verse 15

<b>that I sought understanding</b> I was longing that they should enable me to understand [the vision] from heaven.

Verse 16

<b>in the midst of the Ulai</b> in the midst of the river.
<b>and he called</b> i.e., the man.
<b>and said</b> to the angel, “You, Gabriel.”
<b>enable this one to understand the vision</b> explain the vision to this one.
<b>this one</b> Heb. לְהַלָּז, an expression of esteem, as he called him חֲמוּדוֹת, one of desirable qualities. Wherever it says הַלָז it refers to a person of form, and from here they learned in the Aggadah: Isaac resembled his father in form and in likeness, for he is called הָאִישּׁ הַלָז in the section commencing, “Now it came to pass when Isaac was old.” (Gen. 39:6): “...and Joseph was fair in form and fair in appearance.” This is the beauty enumerated among the five things that a father merits for his son.

Verse 17

<b>to the time of the end.</b> For many days this vision will come about.

Verse 18

<b>I fell into a sound sleep</b> An expression of slumber and bewilderment.
<b>and stood me up where I had been standing</b> Where my feet were standing.

Verse 19

<b>for it is the end of the time</b> for it is at the time of the end of many days.

Verse 20

<b>The kings of Media and Persia</b> The two horns represent two ruling nations, as I explained above.

Verse 21

<b>the first king</b> He is Alexander of Macedon who slew Darius, the son of Esther, as we find in the book of Josiphon (ch. 9).

Verse 22

<b>And the broken one</b> that you saw being broken.
<b>in whose stead stood four</b> as is written in the narration of the dream above (verse 8), [there] are four kingdoms which will arise from that nation, for Alexander of Macedon divided his kingdom upon his death [into parts for] four youths, and Joseph called them four heads of a leopard in his book, and they were not the sons of the king.
<b>but not with its strength</b> The last ones will not be as strong as the first king, but they will be weaker than him.

Verse 23

<b>And at the end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have been destroyed</b> When the end arrives, and the wicked of Israel in the Second Temple will be finished.
<b>a brazen-faced person will rise</b> he is Titus.

Verse 24

<b>And his power will become strong</b> and not with might but with smooth talk, as is explained at the end of the Book (11:21).
<b>and he will destroy wondrously</b> and with wonder upon wonder, he will destroy.
<b>and he will prosper and accomplish</b> his desire.
<b>and he will destroy the mighty</b> many nations.
<b>and the people of the holy ones</b> Israel, who believe in the Torah.

Verse 25

<b>And through his intellect, he will cause the deceit in his hand to prosper</b> And because he is clever wherever he turns and [because] he will prosper, he will hold onto deceit with his hand.
<b>and in his heart he will become proud</b> Heb. יַגְדִּיל, lit, he will grow larger.
<b>and in tranquility he will destroy many</b> With guile and with smooth talk he will destroy many who dwell with him with a covenant and in peace.
<b>and over the Prince of princes he will stand</b> He will speak blasphemously about Heaven. This is the meaning of the dream written above (verse 11): [“And until the Prince of the host it grew.”]
<b>and without strength he will be broken</b> And without strength he will be broken, through a mosquito, the weakest of creatures, which entered his nose, as we learned in Tractate Gittin (56b).

Verse 26

<b>And the vision of the evening and the morning</b> which was said to you in the preceding dream, is true.
<b>and you close up the vision</b> Do not explain it, but close it up in your heart, for it will come about in many days.

Verse 27

<b>became broken</b> Heb. נִהְיֵיתִי, an expression of calamity (הוָה) and breach; i.e., I was pained because of this trouble and I was depressed.
<b>the king’s work</b> for I was appointed over the assignment of the work of the government of Belshazzar’s kingdom, for Nebuchadnezzar his father had appointed him, as is written in the beginning of the Book (2:48): “...and gave him dominion over all the capital cities of Babylon.”
<b>and I was terrified about the vision</b> Heb. וָאֶשְׁתּוֹמֵם עַל הַמַרְאֶה.
<b>but no one realized</b> that I was terrified because I restrained myself before the princes.

Chapter 9



Verse 1

<b>In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus</b> This is not the Ahasuerus of the days of Haman, for he was the king of Persia, whereas this one was Darius the Mede who was crowned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans when Belshazzar was slain, as is written above (6:1): “And Darius the Mede took (sic) the kingdom.”

Verse 2

<b>Contemplated the calculations</b> Heb. בִּינֹתִי בַּסְפָרִים.
<b>the number of the years, etc.</b> I contemplated the calculation of the years, for I thought about what Jeremiah (29:10) prophesied: “For at the completion of seventy years of Babylon I will remember you,” and I thought that this remembrance is the building of the Temple, and that the seventy years end in the first year of Darius the Mede, since the kingdom of Babylon stretched forth a hand upon Israel, when Nebuchadnezzar vanquished Jehoiakim to be his slave. Now that was in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, as the master said (Meg. 11b): “In the first year he conquered Nineveh; in the second year he went up and vanquished Jehoiakim.” Figure from that year until now, and you will find them [the 70 years]. This calculation is found also in the Mishnah of Seder Olam (ch. 28), and we learned there that in the year of Belshazzar’s death were 70 years from the day that Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne: seventy minus one since the day that he conquered Jehoiakim, and yet one more year for Babylon, which Darius completed. And when I [Daniel] saw that the redemption was not hastening to come, I contemplated and put my heart to the calculation, and I knew that I should not have counted according to the conquest of Jehoiakim but [according] to the destruction of Jerusalem, when 70 years will be complete from the exile of Zedekiah, when Jerusalem was destroyed. And there are yet 18 years to come, for this exile was in the eighteenth year counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, as we learned in Seder Olam: “They were exiled in the seventh year; they were exiled in the eighth year; they were exiled in the eighteenth year; they were exiled in the nineteenth year.” Our Sages in Tractate Megillah (11b) explained that they were exiled in the exile of Jeconiah in the seventh year, counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. They were exiled a second time in the eighteenth year, counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>and I confessed</b> the sins of my people.
<b>O great and awesome God</b> but he did not say, “mighty.” He said [to himself], “Heathens are enslaving His children, so where are His mighty deeds?”

Verse 5

<b>turning away</b> We were constantly turning away from Your commandments, tolant in Old French, turning away.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>To you, O Lord, is the righteousness</b> i.e., Your judgments and retributions that You have brought upon us—justice and righteousness are with You.
<b>and to us is the shamefacedness</b> We should be ashamed for what has happened to us, for we caused it for ourselves.
<b>as of this day</b> as we see today.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>To the Lord our God are the mercies</b> that we did not perish for our iniquities, for we rebelled against Him.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>have befallen us</b> Heb. וַתִּתַּךְ, and You caused to reach us, like (Exod. 9:33): לֹא נִתַּךְ אָרְצָה, and Onkelos rendered: did not reach the earth.
<b>the curse and the oath</b> the curses of the Covenant with which You adjured us at Horeb (Lev 26:14): “And if you do not listen etc.”; all the curses written there.

Verse 12

<b>as was done in Jerusalem</b> the sword, slaying, the burning of the city; and they humbled women and put captives into neck irons.

Verse 13

<b>As is written in the Law of Moses</b> a hint that He warned us that if we transgress the oath, all this evil will befall us.

Verse 14

<b>hastened</b> Heb. וַיִשְׁקֹד, and hastened.
<b>for...is righteous</b> for justice is with Him. Our Rabbis, however, explained that the Holy One, blessed be He, is charitable, and it is charity for us that He hastened and brought [the evil] two years before the numerical value of וַנוֹשַּׁנְתֶּם (Deut. 4:25): “and you will have grown old,” in order that [the curse of] “that you shall perish” should not be fulfilled with you. The numerical value of וַנוֹשַּׁנְתֶּם is 852, but they were exiled at the end of 850 [years] after their entry into the land.

Verse 15

<b>And now, O Lord, our God</b> We confess that we have sinned and have dealt wickedly.

Verse 16

<b>a mockery</b> [as translated,] a mockery.
<b>to all those surrounding us</b> to all our neighbors; they all mock us.

Verse 17

<b>for the sake of the Lord</b> For the sake of the holy Name that is called upon the Temple, as it says (Exod. 15:17): “the Sanctuary, O Lord, (אֲדֹנָי) which Your hands have established.”

Verse 18

<b>and see our desolations</b> and the desolations of the city upon which Your name is called, because not upon the support of our righteousness do we cast our supplications to benefit us, but we have come upon Your mercies.

Verse 19

<b>O Lord, hear</b> our supplications.
<b>O Lord, forgive</b> our sins.
<b>O Lord, hearken</b> Your ear to our cry.
<b>and do</b> our request and do not delay.

Verse 20

<b>about the mount of the Sanctuary of my God</b> for the mount of the House of God, that it be built.

Verse 21

<b>at first</b> in the days of Belshazzar, as is written above (8:15 26).
<b>in swift flight</b> [He was] caused to fly to me with flying and with gliding.

Verse 22

<b>And he enabled me to understand</b> Heb. וַיָבֶן.

Verse 23

<b>In the beginning of your supplications, a word came forth</b> a true [word came] from the Holy One, blessed be He, to me to tell you.
<b>for you have desirable qualities</b> You have qualities that are desirable to the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>now contemplate the word</b> Put your heart to understand the word.

Verse 24

<b>Seventy weeks [of years] have been decreed</b> on Jerusalem from the day of the first destruction in the days of Zedekiah until it will be [destroyed] the second time.
<b>to terminate the transgression and to end sin</b> so that Israel should receive their complete retribution in the exile of Titus and his subjugation, in order that their transgressions should terminate, their sins should end, and their iniquities should be expiated, in order to bring upon them eternal righteousness and to anoint upon them (sic) the Holy of Holies: the Ark, the altars, and the holy vessels, which they will bring to them through the king Messiah. The number of seven weeks is four hundred and ninety years. The Babylonian exile was seventy [years] and the Second Temple stood four hundred and twenty [years].

Verse 25

<b>And you shall know and understand from the emergence of the word</b> From the emergence of this word, which emerged at the beginning of your supplications to tell you, you shall know to understand [how] to restore and build Jerusalem.
<b>until the anointed king</b> Time will be given from the day of the destruction until the coming of Cyrus, king of Persia, about whom the Holy One, blessed be He, said that he would return and build His city, and He called him His anointed and His king, as it says (Isa. 45:1): “So said the Lord to His anointed one, to Cyrus etc.” (verse 13): “He shall build My city and free My exiles, etc.”
<b>seven weeks</b> Seven complete shemittah cycles they will be in exile before Cyrus comes, and there were yet three more years, but since they did not constitute a complete shemittah cycle, they were not counted. In the one year of Darius, in which Daniel was standing when this vision was said to him, seventy years from the conquest of Jehoiakim terminated. Deduct eighteen years from them, in which the conquest of Jehoiakim preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, leaving fifty-two years. This is what our Rabbis learned (Yoma 54a): “For fifty-two years no one passed through Judea.” They are the fifty-two years from the day of the destruction until they returned in the days of Cyrus. Hence, we have seven shemittah cycles and three years.
<b>and in sixty-two weeks it will return and be built</b> i.e., the city with its streets.
<b>and moat</b> Heb. וְחָרוּץ. They are the moats that they make around the wall to strengthen the city, which are called fosse in French, ditch or moat.
<b>but in troubled times</b> But in those times they will be troubled and distressed, for in the subjugation of the kings of Persia and the heathens, they will burden them with harsh bondage. Now although there are sixty-two weeks and four years more that remain from the eighth week, whose beginning, viz. the three years, was included in the fifty-two years of the duration of the exile, those four years were not counted here because here he counted only weeks, and you find that from the beginning he started to count seventy weeks, and at the end, when he delineated their times and their judgments, he counted only sixty-nine, proving that one week was divided, part of it here and part of it there; and he mentioned only whole weeks.
<b>but in troubled times</b> They will be troubled in those times.

Verse 26

<b>And after</b> those weeks.
<b>the anointed one will be cut off</b> Agrippa, the king of Judea, who was ruling at the time of the destruction, will be slain.
<b>and he will be no more</b> Heb. וְאֵין לוֹ, and he will not have. The meaning is that he will not be.
<b>the anointed one</b> Heb. מָשִׁיחַ. This is purely an expression of a prince and a dignitary.
<b>and the city and the Sanctuary</b> lit. and the city and the Holy.
<b>and the people of the coming monarch will destroy</b> [The monarch who will come] upon them. That is Titus and his armies.
<b>and his end will come about by inundation</b> And his end will be damnation and destruction, for He will inundate the power of his kingdom through the Messiah.
<b>and until the end of the wars</b> of Gog the city will exist.
<b>cut off into desolation</b> a destruction of desolation.

Verse 27

<b>And he will strengthen a covenant for the princes for one week</b> לָרַבִּים, for the princes, like “and all the officers of (רַבֵּי) the king,” in the Book of Jeremiah (39:13).
<b>will strengthen</b> Titus [will strengthen] a covenant with the princes of Israel.
<b>for one week</b> He will promise them the strengthening of a covenant and peace for seven years, but within the seven years, he will abrogate his covenant.
<b>he will abolish sacrifice and meal-offering</b> This is what he says in the first vision (8: 26): “and in tranquility he will destroy many.” Through a covenant of tranquility, he will destroy them.
<b>and on high, among abominations will be the dumb one</b> This is a pejorative for pagan deities. i.e., on a high place, among abominations and disgusting things, he will place the dumb one, the pagan deity, which is dumb like a silent stone.
<b>high</b> Heb. כְּנַף, lit. wing, an expression of height, like the wing of a flying bird.
<b>and until destruction and extermination befall the dumb one</b> and the ruling of the abomination will endure until the day that the destruction and extermination decreed upon it [will] befall it, in the days of the king Messiah.
<b>befall the dumb one</b> Heb. תִּתַּךְ, reach; and total destruction will descend upon the image of the pagan deity and upon its worshippers.

Chapter 10



Verse 1

<b>and for a long time</b> and it will come in a long time.
<b>and he understood the word</b> and to understand the word, the vision was revealed to me.
<b>and he understood it in the vision</b> Heb. וּבִינָה and to make him understand it in the vision. Now this word is not a noun, like (Job. 38:4): “if you know understanding (בִּינָה) Instead, the “hey” is superfluous, and it is like (Ps 5:2) “understand (בִּינָה) my thoughts” Therefore, the accent is above on the “beth,” and its meaning is like הָבֵן, understand.

Verse 2

<b>had been mourning</b> when he saw that Cyrus had curtailed the construction of the Temple, for he had ordered to commence it, and he reneged because of the missive of the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin: Rehum the adviser and Shimshai the scribe, as is written in the Book of Ezra (4:5).
<b>three weeks of days</b> twenty-one years. They are eighteen years from the one year of Darius the Mede, when he [Daniel] put to his heart to calculate the seventy years of the exile, as it is written: until the second year of Darius the Persian, the son of Esther, who built the Temple. As for the three extra years, I do not know whether he started to fast before them or whether the duration of the acceptance of the vow of his fasts terminated three years after the building.

Verse 3

<b>white bread</b> Heb. לֶחֶם חֲמֻדֹת, white (lit. clean) bread, as Onkelos rendered (Gen. 27:15): “Esau’s clean clothes (הַחֲמֻדֹת),” דַּכְיָתָא, clean.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>clad in linen</b> a linen garment.
<b>with a girdle of gold studded with jewels</b> Heb. בְּכֶתֶם אוּפָז, with a girdle of a cluster of pearls. Every [instance of] כֶּתֶם is an expression of a cluster of gold and precious stones.

Verse 6

<b>And his body was like tarshish</b> Our Sages of blessed memory explained in Tractate Hullin (9lb): “His body was two thousand parasangs large, like the measurement of the sea named Tarshish, and that is the sea of Africa (the Mediterranean).”
<b>brandished</b> Heb. קָלָל, smelted, refined, and shiny.
<b>like the voice of a multitude</b> like the voice of a gathering of a large multitude, whose voice is heard from afar.

Verse 7

<b>but the men who were with me</b> Our Sages of blessed memory said that they were Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.
<b>but a great quaking fell upon them</b> Our Sages of blessed memory said that although a person does not see something of which he is terrified, his guardian angel, who is in heaven, does see it; therefore, he becomes terrified.

Verse 8

<b>was turned in me into corruption</b> Heb. לְמַשְׁחִית, lit. to a destroyer. To corruption, and it is customary for Biblical verses to speak in this manner, like (Jer. 5:8): “They were like armed stallions early in the morning.” מַשְׁכִּים is the equivalent of בְּהַשְׁכָּמַת הַבּקֶר, in the early morning.
<b>I could not summon up strength</b> i.e., I did not gather. All my strength left my innards.

Verse 9

<b>I fell into a sound sleep</b> out of great fright.

Verse 10

<b>and moved me</b> as one who moves a sleeping person to awaken him.

Verse 11

<b>man of desirable qualities</b> אִישׁ חֲמֻדוֹת, pure man.
<b>upright</b> Heb. עַל עָמְדֶךָ, on the stand of your feet.
<b>I have been sent to you</b> I have been sent to you from the Omnipresent.
<b>quaking</b> [as translated,] quaking.

Verse 12

<b>and I have come because of your words</b> I have come on this mission because of your words. Our Rabbis, however, explained in Tractate Yoma (77a): “and I came within the curtain because of you, for I was banned from its midst.”

Verse 13

<b>has been standing against me</b> to battle with me in heaven by requesting an extension for the kingdom for Persia to enable them to subjugate you (Israel). Behold twenty-one days that he has been standing against me.
<b>the first princes</b> those counted first among those who enter.
<b>and I remained there</b> to silence the princes of Persia in heaven.

Verse 14

<b>for there is yet a vision</b> to tell you what has not yet been told, and it will come in many days at an appointed time.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>my joints turned upon me</b> Heb. צִירַי. These are the ends of the bones, all the limbs that are thrust into their sockets and turn within them like a door on its hinge in the socket of the threshold. My joints turned to become dislocated from their place out of much trembling and quaking.

Verse 17

<b>this servant of my lord</b> He refers to himself as a servant, and to the angel as “my lord,” i.e., to say, How will your servant be able to speak with you?

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>And now I shall return to battle with the prince of Persia</b> and I know that I will be victorious, but when the time of the kingdom of the heathens [Greece Malbim ed., Antiochus Vilna ed.] arrives, I know that I will leave, and he will enter after thirty-four years of the existence of the Temple. Alexander of Macedon will rise, for although Israel was subjugated by the kings of Persia in those days, they exacted a light tribute from them, and they did not burden them heavily because the Holy One, blessed be He, caused them to have mercy on them. But the kings of the heathens [Greece, Antiochus] laid a heavy yoke upon them.

Verse 21

<b>what is inscribed in a true script</b> the document of the decree is true, but not one of the heavenly princes is exerting himself to assist me with all these, except etc.

Chapter 11



Verse 1

<b>As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede</b> when the kingdom of Babylon fell, and the rule of Media and Persia commenced, and the princes of Media and Persia entreated the Omnipresent to make the yoke of their frightful rule heavy upon you, I, Gabriel, stood as a supporter and as a stronghold for Michael, your prince.

Verse 2

<b>Behold three more kings</b> Our Sages of blessed memory in Seder Olam (ch. 28) said: “This refers to Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and Darius who rebuilt the Temple. Now what is the meaning of fourth’? The fourth, counting from Media.” In the book of Joseph Ben Gorion, however, it is written that Cyrus had a son who succeeded him before the reign of Ahasuerus, named Cambyses.
<b>and when he becomes strong</b> i.e., Darius.
<b>with his wealth, he will arouse</b> his entire kingdom to wage war against the kingdom of the heathens.

Verse 3

<b>And a mighty king will arise</b> in Greece, viz. Alexander of Macedon.
<b>and do according to his will</b> with Darius the king of Persia, and he will slay him and receive his kingdom, and the Persians will be enslaved by the heathens [the Greeks.

Verse 4

<b>And when he arises, his kingdom will be broken</b> When he becomes very strong and reaches the height of his strength, his kingdom will be broken, meaning that he will die.
<b>and it will be divided to the four directions of the heavens</b> It is written in the book of Ben Gorion (ch. 14) that he divided his kingdom between the four heads of his family; they are the four heads of the leopard that Daniel saw (above 7:6): “And behold another one, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird on its back, and the beast had four heads.” He gave this one dominion in the east, this one in the west, this one in the north and this one in the south, and so in the first vision (8:8): “an appearance of four sprouted in its stead,” concerning the horns of the he-goat.
<b>but not to his posterity</b> The dominion will not come to his sons but to his family members. [The word] אַחֲרִיתוֹ coincides only with the expression of sons, and so Scripture states (Amos 4:2): “and you shall be borne on shields and your posterity (אַחֲרִיתְכֶן) in fishing boats,” which Jonathan renders: and your sons (sic) and daughters in fishermen’s boats.
<b>and not like the dominion that he ruled</b> but the kingdom of these will not be as strong as that of Alexander.
<b>for his kingdom will be uprooted</b> to divide to these four heads and to others besides these.

Verse 5

<b>And the king of the south will overwhelm</b> The head who will reign in the south will be stronger than the head opposite him who reigns in the north, and [stronger] than his officers.

Verse 6

<b>to make a compromise</b> a compromise of peace between him and her father.
<b>will not retain, etc.</b> The king of the north will capture her, those who brought her, and her father who begot her and supported her in her time of trouble.
<b>will not retain</b> The arm of those who brought her [will not retain] strength to stand, [and her father will not prevail] before him, neither he nor his arm, meaning his mighty men.
<b>will be surrendered</b> into the hands of the king of the north, <b>she and those who brought her, and he who begot her</b>, i.e., her father.

Verse 7

<b>A scion of her roots will arise</b> a son sitting on his position, on the throne of the kingdom.
<b>and he will come to the army</b> to the king of the north.
<b>into the stronghold of the king of the north</b> i.e., in the cities of his strength, in his fortresses.
<b>and he will succeed in them</b> Heb. וְעָשָׂה בָהֶם, lit. and he will succeed against them.
<b>and take hold</b> and he will conquer them.

Verse 8

<b>their princes</b> [as translated,] their princes.

Verse 9

<b>And he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south</b> Through the kingdom of the king of the south, who was her father’s father, he will return to his land, which is Egypt, as is stated above: “will bring in captivity to Egypt.”

Verse 10

<b>And his sons</b> [i.e., the sons] of the king of the north will agitate.
<b>and he will come</b> Heb. וּבָא בוֹא, like וְהוֹלֵךְ הָלוֹךְ. The son of the king of the north will come and pass to the land of the south.
<b>and he will return and agitate</b> against the king of the south.
<b>until his stronghold</b> his fortified city.

Verse 11

<b>will wage war</b> will fight against the people.
<b>and the multitude will be given into his hand</b> [i.e., the multitude] of the king of the north [will be given] into his hand.

Verse 12

<b>And the multitude will be raised up</b> that of the king of the north, to become very haughty, for they planned in their hearts to be victorious in the war.
<b>and he will fell myriads</b> many of the army of the king of the south.
<b>but he will not prevail</b> Nevertheless, the victory of the war will not be his.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>and the sons of the renegades of your people will exalt themselves to bring about the vision</b> I saw in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon that they were the renegades of Israel and their company.

Verse 15

<b>and the people of his chosen ones</b> will be in the war.
<b>will have no strength to stand</b> before the king of the north, and although there is a superfluous “vav” here, it is customary for Scripture to speak in this manner as in, for example: “As for its nobles, there are none (וְאֵין) who proclaim the kingdom,” Isaiah (34:12).

Verse 16

<b>will do</b> The king of the north, who comes to the king of the south, [will do] as he wishes.
<b>in the land of beauty</b> in the land of Israel.
<b>and he will destroy it</b> He will destroy the land with his army.

Verse 17

<b>And he will set his face</b> i.e., the king of the north, to come into the strength of the entire kingdom of the king of the south.
<b>and the upright will be with him</b> and Israel will be with the king of the south. Also with them will the king of the north battle in those days.
<b>and he will succeed</b> Heb. וְעָשָׂה, lit. and he will do.
<b>Now the daughter of the women he will give him to destroy her</b> This is the nation of Israel, [referred to in Song of Songs 1:8 as] “the fairest of women.” The king of the north will command the general of his army to destroy her. I say that he is Antiochus, the king of Greece, who issued decrees against Israel, and he commanded his general, Phillip, to kill whoever identified himself as a Jew, as is written in the book of Josiphon (ch. 18).
<b>but it will not stand</b> this counsel of his.
<b>and she will not be for him</b> the daughter of the women, for Mattathias the son of Johanan will rise and break off his [Antiochus’s] yoke from Israel.

Verse 18

<b>and the Prince will terminate his blasphemy to Him</b> His reproach and his blasphemy, with which he blasphemed the Holy One, blessed be He, and Israel, as is written in the book of Josiphon (ch. 20), and He punished him, for He smote him with evil boils while he was in transit, for he went to besiege Jerusalem, and his flesh became putrid, his limbs fell off and he ordered his slaves to bring him back to Antioch, but he did not manage to get there before he died of evil illnesses.

Verse 19

<b>to the strongholds of his land</b> to return to his fortified city.

Verse 20

<b>And one who removes the oppressor will stand on his base</b> and Mattathias the son of Johanan, who removed the oppressor from Israel, and who is the glory of the kingdom of Israel, will strengthen himself on his base on Mt. Modin, for he will be a prince and a mighty man, he and all his descendants after him, viz. the Hasmoneans.
<b>in a few days it will be broken</b> In a few days, their kingdom will be broken.
<b>but not with anger</b> of another nation.
<b>and not with war</b> but from themselves and with themselves, that Hyrcanus and Aristobulus will be jealous over the throne.

Verse 21

<b>And a contemptible person will stand on his base</b> Then the kingdom of Rome will strengthen itself on its stand, as it says (Obad. 1:2): “you are very despised,” and the Romans will rise and take the kingdom from the Greeks.

Verse 22

<b>And the arms of inundation</b> And the mighty of the kingdom, who previously were inundating and powerful, will be inundated before the Romans and be broken.
<b>and also the king with whom they made a covenant</b> Also the king of Israel, who will form a treaty with them, will ultimately be inundated from before him, for [the Romans] will violate the treaty and betray them, as our Sages of blessed memory said: “Twenty-six years they kept their trust with Israel, but later they subjugated them.”

Verse 23

<b>And from the alliance with him he will work deceitfully</b> And from the alliance that Rome will make with Israel, he will work deceitfully, for he will not reveal his evil plan.
<b>and he will go up</b> from his place.
<b>and overpower</b> in all places around the land of Judea: in Edom, in Ammon, and in Moab.
<b>with few people</b> He will not require a massive army, for the king of Judea will aid him, and so it is written in the book of Josiphon (ch. 23).

Verse 24

<b>plunder and spoils and belongings he will distribute to them</b> He will distribute to those who accept their yoke upon themselves until they conquer all with flattery and smooth speech.
<b>will distribute</b> Heb. יִבְזוֹר, like יִפְזוֹר. and so (Ps. 68:31): “he scatters (בִּזַר) peoples.”
<b>and about the fortresses</b> of the nations he will devise in his plans—to station [in them] the heads of his troops until the time that all will be conquered under them.

Verse 25

<b>and he will not stand</b> the king of the south.
<b>because they will devise plans against him</b> They will plot against him to fell him through the bribery that they will bribe his officers to betray him, as he concludes: “and those who eat his food will break him.”

Verse 26

<b>his food</b> Heb. פַּת־בָּגוֹ, his food; one who takes a portion from his table.

Verse 27

<b>As for the two kings</b> the officer of the Romans and the king with whom they made to covenant, which is mentioned above. That is Hyrcanus, who will form an alliance to aid him so that he, too, will aid him against Aristobulus his brother, ruling in Jerusalem.
<b>their hearts are to do evil</b> to the people of your nation, to harm Judea.
<b>and on one table</b> They will murmur lies about the kingdom of Aristobulus.
<b>but it will not succeed</b> for Israel will not be surrendered to destruction in those days.
<b>for there is still an end to the appointed time</b> of the destruction, at the end of sixty two weeks [of years], stated in this Book (9:25), and that appointed time is in the days of Agrippa, the son of Agrippa of the seed of Herod.

Verse 28

<b>And he will return</b> The Roman king [will return] to his land from [fighting] with the king of the south with many possessions.
<b>and his heart is on the covenant with the holy ones</b> to abrogate his treaty with Israel.
<b>and he will succeed</b> Heb. וְעָשָׂה, lit. and he will do, i.e., and he will succeed and return to his land.

Verse 29

<b>After a time</b> Heb. לַמּוֹעֵד, after a time.
but this coming <b>will not be</b> as successful as the first one mentioned above (verse 7): “A scion of her roots will arise etc.,” in which the king of the north succe eded over the king of the south, or like the last, meaning this second time, about which we said: “and he will return to his land” with many possessions.

Verse 30

<b>will come upon him</b> to battle with him.
<b>companies</b> Heb. צִיִים.
<b>Kittites</b> Romans, troops from the kingdom of Rome who will rebel against him.
<b>and he will be crushed</b> He will be slightly broken.
<b>and he will return and be wroth with the holy covenant</b> And he will return to his land and abrogate the treaty he had made with Israel.
<b>and he will return and contemplate those who abandoned the holy covenant</b> He will put his mind to it and contemplate that Israel has abandoned the holy covenant (and law), and unwarranted hatred and controversy will increase in the Second Temple [era], as is written in the book of Josiphon (ch. 45), and they will shed innocent blood, and he will rely on this and know that he will succeed, and he will abrogate his treaty with them and provoke them.

Verse 31

<b>And arms from him will stand</b> He will send his officers and his mighty men to Jerusalem.
<b>and they will profane</b> the stronghold of the Temple.

Verse 32

<b>And those who deal wickedly against the covenant</b> The renegades of Israel, who will join him and deal wickedly against their covenant with their fellows, he will flatter with smooth speech.
<b>but the people that knows its God</b> but the devout of Israel, who will adhere to the fear of their God will grasp it and not abandon it.
<b>and perform</b> their Torah.

Verse 33

<b>And the wise of the people</b> the wise among them, such as the household of Rabbi [Judah Hanasi] and the sages of the generations.
<b>will allow the public to understand</b> They will preach the Torah to the common people and encourage them to adhere to it.
<b>will stumble</b> in their exile by the sword and by flames, etc.

Verse 34

<b>they will be helped with a little help</b> Through bribes and the money that they will pay tribute to their enemies, they will be helped.

Verse 35

<b>will stumble to clarify some of them</b> They will stumble in the calculations of the end, for they will put their mind to refine them and to resolve them to know them, but they will err concerning them.

Verse 36

<b>And the king will do as he wishes</b> the kingdom of Rome.
<b>and he will succeed until the fury is spent</b> until the wrath of the Holy One, blessed be He, returns from Israel.
<b>when it will be finished and executed</b> when His decree will be finished. כִּי is like כַּאֲשֶׁר, when.

Verse 37

<b>And he will not contemplate the God of his fathers</b> he will not put his mind to the Holy One, blessed be He, Who is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, his [i.e., Israel’s] forefathers.
<b>the most desirable of women</b> the nation of Israel, [called] fairest of women.

Verse 38

<b>But the god of the strongholds</b> the god of the cherubim who will make a treaty with him.
<b>on its base he will honor</b> for he will flatter the nations to be subservient to him.

Verse 39

<b>And he will construct</b> buildings.
<b>for the fortresses of the strongholds with a foreign god</b> i.e., in honor of a foreign god.
<b>whomever he will recognize, he will honor increasingly</b> He will increase the honor [and greatness] of those princes whom he will see fit to recognize their faces and to flatter.
<b>and he will apportion</b> to them.
<b>for a price</b> for little money.

Verse 40

<b>And at the time of the end</b> when our redemption draws near.
<b>and the king of the north will storm over him</b> over the king of the south.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

<b>Now at that time, Michael...will be silent</b> He will be silent like a mute person, for he will see the Holy One, blessed be He, judging by Himself and saying, “How will I destroy a great nation like this for the sake of Israel?”
<b>and it will be a time of distress</b> in heaven there will be accusations against Torah scholars, [and there will be] plunderers and plunderers of plunderers, as our Rabbis said in the Aggadah in the last chapter of Kethuboth (112b).
<b>your people will escape</b> The kingdom of Gog will be destroyed and Israel will escape.
<b>everyone who is found inscribed in the book</b> This is a short verse, [meaning] whoever is found inscribed in this Book, through the dreams inscribed in it (7: 11): “until the beast is slain”; (verse 18): “and the high holy ones will receive the kingdom.” All will be fulfilled.

Verse 2

<b>And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awaken</b> The dead will come to life.

Verse 3

<b>And the wise</b> who engaged in the Torah and in the commandments, will shine like the brightness of the sky.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>and when they have ended shattering the strength of the holy people</b> Heb. נַפֵּץ יַד, lit. shattering the hand. When Israel’s strength terminates, [similar to] (Deut. 32:36): “that power has vanished (אָזְלַת יַד) and nothing left to keep or abandon.”

Verse 8

<b>but I did not understand</b> I did not know what “the time of two times and a half” means.
<b>what is the end of these</b> the end of these calculations.

Verse 9

<b>until the time of the end</b> until our redemption draws near.

Verse 10

<b>They will be clarified and whitened</b> [i.e.,] these calculations.
<b>and...will be purified</b> [i.e.,] many [will be purified] by them to understand them.
<b>and the wicked will pervert</b> the calculations by computing them incorrectly, and when they terminate, they will say that there is no more redemption.
<b>will not understand</b> All the wicked [will not understand] them.
<b>but the wise will understand</b> them when the time of the end arrives.

Verse 11

<b>And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed</b> in order to place a silent abomination in its stead, are days of one thousand two hundred and ninety years since the daily sacrifice was removed until it will be restored in the days of our King Messiah, and this calculation coincides with the calculation of (8:14): “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred” from the day of their exile to Egypt until the final redemption: Egyptian exile 210; From their Exodus until the First Temple 480; First Temple 410; Babylonian exile 70; Second Temple 420; Totalling 1590. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction, which equals 1584. Add 1290, and the total sum is 2874; like the numerical value of בֹּקֶר עֶרֶב [574] plus 2300 [2874].

Verse 12

<b>Fortunate is he who waits etc.</b> Forty five years are added to the above number, for our King Messiah is destined to be hidden after he is revealed and to be revealed again. So we find in Midrash Ruth, and so did Rabbi Eleazar HaKalir establish (in the concluding poem of the morning service of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): “and he will be concealed from them six weeks of years.”

Verse 13

<b>go to the end</b> You will depart to your everlasting home.
<b>to your lot</b> to receive your portion with the righteous.
<b>at the end of the days</b> Heb. לְקֵץ הַיָמִין, like בְּאַחֲרִית הַיָמִים. We cannot interpret הַיָמִין as an expression of the right hand, because it is mentioned in the Large Masorah among the six words that are unusual because they have a final “nun” at the end of the word, which serves instead of a “mem,” and there is none like them, e.g. (Job 31:10): “and may others (אֲחֵרִין) kneel upon her;” (ibid. 24:22): “and he is not sure of life (בַּחַיִין)” (Ezek. 4:9): “take yourself wheat (חִטִין)”; (ibid. 26: 18): “Now the isles (הָאִיִן) will tremble;” (Prov. 31:3): “to the pleasures of kings;” (here): “to the end of the days (הַיָמִין).”
