Rashi on Esther



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus</b> He was the king of Persia who reigned instead of Cyrus at the end of the seventy years of the Babylonian exile.
<b>he was the Ahasuerus</b> He was equally wicked from beginning to end.
<b>who reigned</b> He reigned on his own, and was not of royal seed.
<b>from Hodu to Cush, etc.</b> He reigned over one hundred twenty-seven provinces as he reigned from Hodu to Cush, which are situated alongside one another, and so [we explain] (I Kings 5:4): “For he had dominion over all [the inhabitants of] this side of the river, from Tiphsah even to Gaza,” meaning that he had dominion over all the inhabitants of this side of the river, just as he had dominion from Tiphsah to Gaza.

Verse 2

<b>when King Ahasuerus sat, etc.</b> when the kingdom was firmly established in his hand. Our Sages, however, explained it differently in Tractate Megillah (11b).

Verse 3

<b>the nobles</b> Heb. הַפַּרְתְּמִים, governors in Persian.

Verse 4

<b>many days</b> He made a banquet for them.

Verse 5

<b>the garden</b> a place where vegetables are sown.
<b>orchard</b> where trees are planted.

Verse 6

<b>white, fine cotton, and blue</b> He spread out various types of colored garments for them for spreads.
<b>embroidered with cords of linen and purple</b> embroidered with threads of linen and purple; he spread these out for them on rods of silver and on columns of marble.
<b>couches of gold and silver</b> he set [them] up to sit upon for the feast.
<b>on a pavement of</b> floors of green and white, etc. Our Sages identified them as kinds of precious stones, and according to the apparent meaning of the verse, these were their names.

Verse 7

<b>And they gave them to drink in golden vessels</b> Heb., like וּלְהַשְּׁקוֹת, and to give to drink.
<b>and the vessels differed from one another</b> Heb. שּׁוֹנִים, different from each other, and likewise, (below 3: 8) “and their laws differ (שּׁנוֹת),” and our Sages expounded what they expounded.
<b>and royal wine was plentiful</b> It was abundant; and our Sages said that he gave each one to drink wine that was older than he.

Verse 8

<b>according to the law</b> Because there are feasts in which they coerce those seated to drink [the contents] of a large vessel, and some can drink it only with difficulty, but here, no one coerced [anyone].
<b>ordained</b> Heb. יִסַד, an expression referring to a foundation (יְסוֹד) ; i.e., so he instituted and ordained.
<b>upon every steward of his house</b> upon all the stewards of the feast: the chief baker, the chief butcher, and the chief butler.
<b>to do according to every man’s wish</b> Heb. אִישּׁ וָאִישּׁ, lit. man and man, for each one his desire.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>On the seventh day</b> Our Rabbis said that it was the Sabbath.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>But Queen Vashti refused</b> Our Rabbis said (Meg. 12b): Because leprosy broke out on her, in order that she should refuse and be killed. Because she would force Jewish girls to undress, and work on the Sabbath, it was decreed that she should be stripped naked on the Sabbath.
<b>became very wroth</b> because she sent him shameful words.

Verse 13

<b>for so was the king’s custom</b> For it was the king’s custom in every judgment to present the matter before all who knew law and judgment.

Verse 14

<b>And the nearest to him</b> to present his words before them were the following: Carshena, Shethar, etc.

Verse 15

<b>According to the law what [is there] to do</b> This refers back to “And the king said to the wise men.”

Verse 16

<b>has...done wrong</b> Heb. עָוְתֳה, an expression of iniquity (עָוֹן).

Verse 17

<b>For the word of the queen will spread to all the women</b> that she disgraced the king—[this will cause] all the women to despise their husbands as well.

Verse 18

<b>the princesses of Persia and Media, etc. will say</b> this word to all the princes; this is an ellipsis.
<b>and much contempt and wrath</b> And in this matter, there is much contempt and wrath.

Verse 19

<b>a royal edict</b> a royal edict of revenge, i.e., that he commanded to execute her.
<b>and let it be inscribed in the laws of Persia and Media</b> in the books of the statutes and the customs of the kingdom.
<b>and let it not be revoked</b> this statute from among them; this should be a statute and a law for anyone who shows contempt for her husband.
<b>that Vashti did not come</b> and therefore, she was executed.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>and speak according to the language of his nationality</b> He can compel his wife to learn his language if her native tongue is different.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>he remembered Vashti</b> her beauty, and he became sad.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>And let the king appoint commissioners</b> since each commissioner is familiar with the beautiful women in his province.
<b>their ointments</b> These are things that cleanse, like (Lev. 6:21): “it shall be scoured (וּמֹרַק) and rinsed.” [This includes] perfumed oil, various ingredients and spices that cleanse and smoothen the skin.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>a Judean man</b> because he was exiled with the exile of Judah; all those who were exiled with the kings of Judah were called יְהוּדִים [Judeans, Jews] among the nations, even if they were from another tribe.
<b>a Benjamite</b> He was from Benjamin. That is the simple meaning, but our Sages explained what they explained.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>for a daughter</b> Heb. לְבַת. Our Sages explained: לבית, for a house, meaning for a wife.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>and he hastened her ointments</b> He was more diligent and quicker with bringing her [ointments] than those of all of them.
<b>fitting to give to her</b> to serve her, and so they would do for all of them; and our Sages explained what they explained.

Verse 10

<b>not to reveal</b> so that they should say that she was from an ignoble family and dismiss her, for if they knew that she was of the family of King Saul, they would detain her.

Verse 11

<b>and what would be done to her</b> He was one of two righteous men to whom a hint of salvation was given: David and Mordecai. David—as it is said (I Sam. 17:36): “Both the lion and the bear has your bondsman smote.” He said [to himself], “This incident happened to me only to teach me to have faith that I can battle with this one [Goliath].” Likewise, Mordecai said [to himself], “The only reason that this righteous woman was taken to the bed of a gentile was because she is destined to arise and save Israel.” He therefore went around to find out what would be her fate.

Verse 12

<b>turn</b> Heb. תֹּר, her time.

Verse 13

<b>whatever she would request</b> any entertainment or types of music.

Verse 14

<b>to the second house of the women</b> Heb. שֵּׁנִי [Like the usual form] הַשֵּׁנִי.

Verse 16

<b>in the tenth month</b> the cold season, when one body enjoys [the warmth of] another body. The Holy One, blessed be He, designated that cold season in order to endear her to him.

Verse 17

<b>more than all the women</b> Those he had lived with, for he had also gathered all the women he had lived with.

Verse 18

<b>and he granted a release</b> In her honor, he released them from the tax that was [levied] upon them.
<b>and gave gifts</b> He sent them gifts, and everything was in order to entice her, perhaps she would tell her nationality. But nevertheless—Esther would not tell.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Esther would not tell her lineage</b> because Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate; he was encouraging her and hinting to her about it.

Verse 21

<b>to lay a hand</b> to give him poison to drink.

Verse 22

<b>And the matter became known to Mordecai</b> For they were discussing their affairs before him in the Tarsean language, and they did not know that Mordecai was familiar with seventy languages, for he was one of those who sat in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.

Verse 23

<b>and it was written in the diary</b> the favor that Mordecai did for the king.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>After these events</b> this remedy was created to be a salvation for Israel.
<b>King Ahasuerus promoted Haman</b> For the Holy One, blessed be He, creates a remedy for Israel’s blow before He brings the blow upon them.

Verse 2

<b>would kneel and prostrate themselves</b> Because he made himself a god; therefore “Mordecai would neither kneel nor prostrate himself.”

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>whether Mordecai’s words would stand up</b> [i.e., the words of Mordecai,] who said that he would never prostrate himself because he was a Jew, and was warned against idolatry.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>one cast the pur</b> Whoever cast it, cast it, and the verse does not specify who. This is an elliptical verse.
<b>that is the lot</b> Scripture explains: and what is the pur? That is the lot. He cast lots [to determine] in which month he would succeed.
<b>from day to day</b> in which day of the month he would succeed.

Verse 8

<b>and...the king’s laws</b> to give taxes for the king’s work.
<b>it is of no use</b> There is no apprehension; there is no profit.

Verse 9

<b>let it be written to destroy them</b> Let letters be written to be sent to the governors of the provinces to destroy them.

Verse 10

<b>And the king took his ring off</b> This represents the granting of any great matter that is requested of the king; the one who has the ring on his hand is the ruler over all the king’s affairs.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>And letters shall be sent</b> Heb. וְנִשְּׁלוֹחַ. And letters shall be sent, יtre tramis in O.Fr., to be sent, which is of the [same grammatical] structure as (Jud. 11:25): “did he ever fight? (נִלְחוֹם נִלְחַם)”; (I Sam. 2:27): “Did I appear? (נִגְלֹה נִגְלֵיתִי) (Hos. 10:15): “was silenced (נִדְמֹה נִדְמָה).”
<b>on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month</b> On the thirteenth day of that month, which is the twelfth month of the year.

Verse 14

<b>The copy of the writ</b> Heb. פַּתְשֶּׁגֶן, an Aramaism, the account of the writ, deresmant in Old French, text, contents, account.
<b>for an edict to be given</b> The command of the writ was that it proclaimed that the decree of the king should be issued as a statute.
<b>published to all the peoples</b> This matter.

Verse 15

<b>and the edict was given in Shushan the capital</b> the place where the king was situated; there the statute was given on that day, to be ready for the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. Therefore
<b>and the city of Shushan was perturbed</b> [i.e] the Jews therein.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<b>And Mordecai knew all that had transpired</b> The Master of Dreams told him that the celestial beings had concurred about it, because they had prostrated themselves to an image in the days of Nebuchadnezzar and because they had enjoyed Ahasuerus’s feast.

Verse 2

<b>for one may not enter</b> It is improper to enter the king’s gate dressed in sackcloth.

Verse 3

<b>the king’s orders and his edict</b> When the couriers carrying the letters passed, the edict was given in the city.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>the full account of the silver</b> the explanation of the silver.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Do not imagine to yourself</b> Heb. אַל תְּדַמִי, do not think, like (Num. 33:56) “And it will be, that which I thought (דִמִיתִי).” Do not imagine to yourself; do not think to escape in the king’s palace on the day of the massacre; because you do not wish to imperil yourself now to come to the king without permission.

Verse 14

<b>and who knows whether at a time like this</b> And who knows whether the king will desire you next year, which is the time of the massacre.
<b>at a time like this</b> For he was presently in Nisan, and the time of the massacre was in Adar of the next year.
<b>you will attain the kingdom</b> if you will attain the greatness which you now enjoy.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>contrary to the law</b> for it is contrary to the law for one who is not summoned to enter. And the Midrash Aggadah [explains]: contrary to the law, for until now, I was coerced [to cohabit with him], but now [I will do so] willingly.
<b>and if I perish, I perish</b> And just as I have begun to go to destruction [by appearing before Ahasuerus without being summoned], I will go and die. And the Midrash Aggadah (ad loc.) [explains]: As I am lost to my father’s house, so will I be lost to you, for from now on, that I am submitting willingly to a heathen, I will be forbidden to you.

Verse 17

<b>So Mordecai passed</b> i.e., he transgressed the law by fasting on the first festive day of Passover, for he fasted on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the sixteenth, since the letters were written on the thirteenth day.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<b>regally</b> regal clothing. But our Sages said (Meg. 15a) that divine inspiration enwrapped her, as it is said (I Chron. 12:18): “And a spirit enwrapped Amasai.”

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>Even to half the kingdom</b> A thing that is in the middle and at the halfway mark of the kingdom. That is the Temple, which they started to build in the days of Cyrus, and he reneged and commanded to discontinue the work, and Ahasuerus, who succeeded him, also discontinued the work. The simple meaning of the verse is: Even if you request half the kingdom from me, I will give it to you.

Verse 4

<b>let the king and Haman come</b> Our Sages stated many reasons for the matter. What did Esther see (i.e., what motivated her) to invite Haman? In order to make the king and the princes jealous of him, that the king should think that he desired her and kill him, and many other reasons.
<b>to the banquet</b> Heb. (הַמִשְּׁתֶּה) lit. drinking feast. Every banquet is called (מִשְּׁתֶּה) on account of the wine, which is the principal feature.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>and tomorrow I will do the king’s bidding</b> that which you requested of me all these days, i.e., to reveal my nationality and my lineage to you.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>restrained himself</b> He strengthened himself to control his anger because he was afraid to take revenge without the sanction of the king. וַיִתְאַפַּק is eseretint in Old French, and he controlled himself.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>is worth nothing to me</b> I do not care for all the honor that I have.
<b>every time, etc.</b> Our Sages said that he [Mordecai] would show him a deed that he [Haman] had sold himself [to Mordecai] as a slave because he lacked food when Mordecai and Haman were appointed heads of troops in a war.

Chapter 6



Verse 1

<b>the king’s sleep was disturbed</b> It was a miracle. And some say that he took to heart that Esther had invited Haman; perhaps she had set her eyes upon him, and he would assassinate him.
<b>to bring the book of the records</b> It is customary for kings that when their sleep is disturbed, parables and lectures are recited to them until their sleep is restored. Our Rabbis, however, explained that since he took to heart [the matter of] Haman and Esther, he said [to himself], “It is impossible that none of my friends should know their plan and divulge it to me.” He [thought] again and said [to himself], “Perhaps someone did me a favor, and I did not reward him and they don’t care about me anymore.” Therefore, “he ordered to bring the book of the records.”

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>And let the raiment and the horse</b> But he did not mention the crown, for he saw that the king became jealous because he said that they should place the crown on a person’s head.

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>And Mordecai returned</b> to his sackcloth and to his fasting.
<b>mourning and with his head covered</b> Our Sages explained the matter in Tractate Megillah (ad loc.).

Verse 13

<b>before whom you have begun to fall, etc.</b> She said, “This nation has been compared to the stars and to the dust. When they descend, they descend to the dust, and when they ascend, they ascend to the sky and the stars.”

Chapter 7



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>may my life be given me</b> that I should not be slain on the thirteenth of Adar, for you have issued an edict of massacre upon my people and my kindred.
<b>and my people</b> shall be given me in my request, that they should not be slain. Now if you ask, “What does it concern you?” (below 8:6): “For how can I see, etc.?”

Verse 4

<b>for the adversary has no consideration for the king’s loss</b> He does not care for the king’s loss, for if he sought your benefit, he should have said, “Sell them for slaves and bondswomen and receive the money, or keep them to be your slaves, they and their descendants.”

Verse 5

<b>And King Ahasuerus said, and he said to Queen Esther</b> Wherever it says, “And he said, and he said,” twice, it is to be expounded upon, and the midrashic interpretation of this is: Originally, he would speak to her by messenger, but now that he knew that she was of a royal family, he spoke to her personally.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>was determined</b> the evil, the hatred, and the vengeance were decided.

Verse 8

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>Behold the house of Haman, etc.</b> And from now on everyone will see that I desire you, and whatever you say, everyone will believe that it comes from me; therefore, you do not have to rescind them, but write other letters as you see fit.

Verse 8

<b>cannot be rescinded</b> It is not fitting to rescind it and to invalidate the king’s writ.

Verse 9

<b>according to its script</b> with its characters.
<b>according to its tongue</b> the spoken language.

Verse 10

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>The ten sons of Haman</b> I saw in Seder Olam (ch. 29): These are the ten who wrote a [false] accusation against Judea and Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Ezra (4:6): “And in the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the dwellers of Judea and Jerusalem.” Now what was the accusation? To stop those who ascended from the exile during the days of Cyrus, who had commenced to build the Temple, and the Cutheans slandered them and stopped them, and when Cyrus died, and Ahasuerus reigned, and Haman was promoted, he feared that those in Jerusalem would engage in the construction, and they sent in the name of Ahasuerus to the princes of the other side of the river to stop them.
<b>but on the spoil they did not lay their hands</b> so that the king should not cast an envious eye on their money.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>the...villagers</b> who do not dwell in walled cities, [celebrate] on the fourteenth, and those who dwell in walled cities [celebrate] on the fifteenth, like Shushan, and [these cities] must be surrounded [by walls] since the days of Joshua the son of Nun. So did our Sages expound and learn.
<b>and...sending</b> Heb. וּמִשְּׁלֹחַ. This is a noun, like מִשְּׁמָר, watch, מִשְּׁמָע hearing. Therefore, the “shin” is vowelized soft (without a “dagesh”).

<b>he commanded through letters</b> The king stated orally and commanded to write letters that his evil device return upon his own head.

Verse 26

<b>therefore, because of all the words of this letter</b> these days were established, and therefore it was written for future generations to know.
<b>and what they saw</b> those who did these deeds, that they did them.
<b>and what happened to them</b> What did Ahasuerus see that he used the sacred vessels, and what happened to them? That Satan came and danced among them and slew Vashti. And what did Haman see that he became envious of Mordecai, and what happened to him? They hanged him and his sons. And what did Mordecai see that he did not kneel or prostrate himself, and what did Esther see that she invited Haman?

Verse 27

<b>who join them</b> proselytes who were destined to convert.
<b>according to their script</b> that the Scroll [of Esther] should be written in the Ashuri script.

Verse 28

<b>remembered</b> with the reading of the Scroll [of Esther].
<b>and celebrated</b> feasting and rejoicing and a festive day, to give portions [of food to friends] and gifts [to the poor].
<b>every family</b> gather together and feast and drink together, and so they took upon themselves that the Purim days would not be revoked.

<b>shall not cease</b> Heb. לֹא יָסוּף. This is the Aramaic translation of יִתֹּם, will end, for the Targum of (Deut. 2:14) “עַד תֹּם” is עַד דְסַף, until it finished, and it is impossible to say that it is derived from the same root as (Gen. 19:15): “lest you perish (תִּסָפֶה),” or from the same root as (I Sam. 27:1): “Now I shall perish (אֶסָפֶה) one day,” for if that were so, Scripture should have written: לֹא יִסָפֶה מִזַרְעָם.

Verse 29

<b>all [acts of] power</b> the power of the miracle of Ahasuerus, of Alaman, of Mordecai, and of Esther.
