Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>And in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia</b> This book is arranged as a continuation of the Book of Daniel, as is explained in Baba Bathra (15a), and the word [וּבְשְׁנַת] refers back from this [book] to that one, for it is stated in Daniel (9:2): “In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, contemplated the calculations of the number of the years that the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah the prophet from the destruction of Jerusalem, seventy years.” And so the entire chapter proceeds to relate [the story] of the destruction of the Temple, the time of the Babylonian exile, and his confession, in which he confessed Israel’s sin. The beginning of this book is as follows: After Belshazzar was assassinated, Darius the Mede reigned, as it says (Dan. 6:1): “And Darius the Mede received the kingdom etc.” and after Darius’ death, this Cyrus, the king of Persia, reigned, and in the first year of his reign, the seventy years for the remembrance of the Babylonian exile, [counting] from the day that Jehoiakim was exiled, were completed, as it says (Jer. 29:10): “At the completion of seventy years of Babylon, I will remember you etc.” When Israel returned from the Babylonian exile to the land of Israel, in that year, in the first year of Cyrus, Israel laid the foundation of the Temple, and the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin slandered them to Cyrus, the king of Persia, and he commanded [them] to curtail the work, no longer to build the edifice of the Temple; and the Israelites were idle, for they did not build the Temple during the entire reign of Cyrus and Ahasuerus, who succeeded him, until the second year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, the king of Persia, who was Darius, the son of Esther. And in the second year of his reign, they began building the Temple until the building was completed. And from the first year of Cyrus until the second year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus the king of Persia, in whose days the Temple was built, were eighteen years, to fulfill what was said (Dan. 9:2): “from the destruction of Jerusalem, seventy years etc.” And now, in the second year of Darius, seventy years had elapsed since the destruction of Jerusalem; [i.e.,] the destruction of the Temple, when Zedekiah was exiled. From the exile of Jehoiakim until the exile of Zedekiah, when the Temple was destroyed, were eighteen years, and now in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, seventy years since the exile of Jehoiakim, when Israel was exiled to Babylon, were completed, and thereby the verse that states (Jer. 29:10): “for at the completion of seventy years of Babylon I will remember you etc.” was fulfilled. And this is the remembrance, that Israel returned to their soil and built the foundation of the building of the Temple, although it was not yet completed. We find that there were fifty-two years from the exile of Zedekiah, when the Temple was destroyed, until the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia; and eighteen years after the first year of Cyrus, which is the second year of Darius, when Israel commenced to build the edifice, and they completed it. This is proven in Seder Olam (ch. 29), in Tractate Megillah (11b) and in this book, as I explained.
<b>at the completion of the word of the Lord from the mouth of Jeremiah</b> at the time that the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, which Jeremiah spoke, was completed, as it says (Jer. 29:10): “for at the completion of seventy years of Babylon etc.”
<b>the Lord aroused the spirit</b> the will.
<b>a proclamation</b> He proclaimed a proclamation throughout his kingdom.
<b>and also in writing</b> And he also sent his letter throughout his kingdom about this matter.
<b>saying</b> And so he said to them in his proclamation that he proclaimed and in his epistle that he sent throughout his kingdom.

Verse 2

<b>So said Cyrus, the king of Persia...delivered to me</b> that I am the king and ruler over all the kingdoms.
<b>and He commanded me</b> He commanded me through Isaiah the prophet to build for Him the Temple in Jerusalem, as it says in the Book of Isaiah (44:28): “Who says to Cyrus, ‘He is My shepherd, and all My desire he shall fulfill,’ and to say to Jerusalem, ‘It shall be built, and the Temple shall be founded.’” (ibid. 45:1): “So said the Lord to His anointed one, to Cyrus, whose right hand I held....” And this prophecy was already stated by lsaiah.
<b>in Jerusalem, which is in Judea</b> whch is in the province of Judea.

Verse 3

<b>Who is among you</b> So did he announce and write to all the kingdoms, “Who is among you of all His people,” [i.e., of the people] of the Holy One, blessed be He, may the Holy One, blessed be He, be at his assistance, and let him ascend to build His house that is in Jerusalem.

Verse 4

<b>And whoever remains</b> and every Jew who remains in his place, who cannot ascend because he has no money.
<b>shall help him</b> I command the people of his place to provide him and help him with silver, gold, possessions and cattle, in order that he be able to ascend to Jerusalem with the donation that the people of his place will donate for the building of the Temple, for also among the nations there were some who contributed donations to the building of the Temple.
<b>to the House of God, which is in Jerusalem</b> From “So said Cyrus” until here is the proclamation and the message of the written epistle.

Verse 5

<b>of Judah and Benjamin</b> the heads of the families of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
<b>all whom... inspired</b> They ascended to Jerusalem to build the Temple with all those whom God inspired to ascend and to build the Temple.

Verse 6

<b>And all those around them</b> And all the nations who were Israel’s neighbors assisted and strengthened the hands of the Jews with gold and silver and all these gifts in order that they be able to ascend to Jerusalem.
<b>besides all that was donated</b> All this the neighbors of the Jews did, besides what they [the Jews] themselves donated for the building of the Temple.

Verse 7

<b>and had placed them in the temple of his god</b> that Nebuchadnezzar had placed in the temple of his pagan deity.

Verse 8

<b>by the hand of Mithderath the treasurer</b> such was the name of Cyrus’s treasurer, and Cyrus commanded [him] to take them out.
<b>and he counted them out</b> This treasurer counted them and delivered them to Sheshbazzar, so that he would carry them and transport them to Jerusalem. Our Rabbis said: “Sheshbazzar is identical with Daniel, and why was he called Sheshbazzar? Because he endured six troubles (שֵּׁשּׁ צָרוֹת) .”
<b>the prince of Judah</b> He is the prince of the tribe of Judah.

Verse 9

<b>their number</b> of the vessels of the House of the Lord.
<b>basins</b> Heb. אֲגַרְטְלֵי. They are kinds of vessels.
<b>knives</b> Heb. מַחֲלָפִים. They are knives, and this expression refers to the chamber of the knives (בֵּית הַחֲלִיפוֹת). Because they would deposit the knives therein, it was called the chamber of the depository of the knives (לִשְּׁכַּת בֵּית הַחֲלִיפוֹת).

Verse 10

<b>bowls</b> Heb. כְּפוֹרֵי, bowls, and they were called כְּפוֹרֵי from an expression of wiping, like (Bava Mezia 24b): “who wiped (דְּכָפַר) his hands on his neighbor’s cloak,” because the one who would receive the blood in a bowl would wipe the squirtings of the blood that splattered on his hand on the rim of the bowl.
<b>secondary</b> Heb. מִשְּׁנִים, secondary ones, other vessels of another kind.

Verse 11

<b>All the vessels</b> Now he totals the sum of those counted and those who were not counted all into one number, but the important ones he counts.
<b>when the exiles were brought up</b> Heb. הֵעָלוֹת, [a passive] expression.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>And these are the people of the province</b> These are the Children of Israel who are from the province of the land of Israel, who are now coming up to Jerusalem from the captivity that is in the exile.
<b>and they returned</b> And now they returned to Jerusalem.
<b>and Judea</b> And the people of Judea returned, each one to his city.

Verse 2

<b>[Those] who came</b> these people of the province, in the beginning, when they went into exile from Israel to Babylon with Zerubbabel etc.
<b>Mispar...the number</b> Heb. מִסְפָּר. [This word appears twice in this verse.] In the first one, the “pay” is vowelized with a “kamatz,” and it is the name of a man; in the second, the “pay” is vowelized with a “pattah”, and it is the construct state, [meaning the number of].
<b>the important men of the people of Israel</b> These were the great and important people, and the others followed them. Therefore, they were counted after them separately.

Verse 3

<b>The children of Parosh, etc.</b> There are some in the chapter for whom the father’s name is used for the family name [surname] and there are some who are called by the name of their place, i.e., “the children of such-and-such a place.”

Verse 59

<b>And these were the ones who ascended from Tel-Mela, etc.</b> And what incident happened to them? They could not tell....
<b>and their children</b> [i.e., the children] of their fathers, because they lost their genealogical records and did not know if they were Israelites.

Verse 60

<b>The children of Delaiah</b> They too are included in “these were the ones who ascended from Tel- Melah.”

Verse 61

<b>who took</b> Each one of the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite took a wife.
<b>and was called by their name</b> And the name of Barzillai was called on their name because they took of his daughters.

Verse 62

<b>These</b> referring to the priests, who had to trace their lineage with that record, and who could not find the record of their lineage.
<b>and they were disqualified</b> Heb. וַיְגאַלוּ, for they were defiled and purged from the priesthood that they should no longer perform the service with the remaining priests, because their genealogical record was not found.

Verse 63

<b>Hattirshatha</b> That is Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah (Neh. 8:9), and our Rabbis said (Yerushalmi Kid. 4:1) that he was named Hattirshatha because the Sages permitted him (הָתֵּר) to drink (שָּׁתָּא) wine of gentiles because he was the king’s butler.
<b>of the most holy sacrifices</b> sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, like the other priests.
<b>until a priest arises, etc.</b> like a person who says to his friend, “Until the Messiah comes, this matter will not come about.” I cannot interpret it to mean: until a priest arises for the Urim and Tumim in the Second Temple, because we find in Yoma, chapter 1 (21b) that the Urim and Tumim were missing in the Second Temple.

Verse 64

<b>The entire congregation together</b> When they were all together with the priests, the Levites and the Nethinim, they amounted to this number; and the Children of Israel counted above were of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and those missing from this number, which you will not find above, were of the other tribes. So it is explained in Seder Olam (ch. 29): “‘The entire congregation together was forty-two thousand etc.’ But if you add them up, they are only thirty thousand. Where are the thirteen thousand? They ascended from the other tribes.”

Verse 65

<b>Besides their slaves and their bondwomen</b> who were not included in the congregation.
<b>and they had two hundred male and female singers</b> because they were going up joyfully from Babylon to the land of Israel, they required male and female singers in order that they should stroll among them in their great joy.

Verse 66



Verse 67



Verse 68

<b>donated</b> They were donating toward the building of the Temple.

Verse 69

<b>According to their ability</b> according to their ability and their money.
<b>drachmas</b> Heb. דַּרְכְּמוֹנִים, the name of a golden coin.
<b>and priests’ tunics</b> in which to serve.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>arrived</b> Heb. וַיִגַע like וְהִגִיעַ, it reached.
<b>The seventh month</b> That is the month of Tishri, and the Children of Israel who were in the cities, what did they do? They all gathered as one to Jerusalem.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>And they set the altar on its bases</b> in order to offer up sacrifices upon it, because they were afraid of the peoples of the land, lest they taunt them and lest they slander them to the king. And they built the altar to offer up burnt offerings upon it, in order that the peoples hear and understand the matter, that they did it with the sanction of the king and therefore they would hesitate to taunt them about the building of the Temple.
<b>for the morning and for the evening</b> the daily sacrifice of the morning and the daily sacrifice of twilight.

Verse 4

<b>and the burnt offering of each day in its day, in the number</b> the sacrifices of the Festivals in their number, according to their ordinance.

Verse 5

<b>And afterwards</b> And after Succoth they would offer up sacrifices every day, for the morning and for the evening.
<b>and for the New Moon</b> lit. and for the months. And at the beginning of the months they would offer up the sacrifices of the New Moon.
<b>and for all the appointed seasons of the Lord</b> and for the rest of the appointed seasons of their sacrifices.
<b>and for everyone who willingly offered</b> And for all those who willingly offered their free-will offerings, the priests would accept them to sacrifice them, and from the first day of Tishri they commenced to offer up sacrifices, but the foundation of the Temple was not yet built.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians</b> the people of Tyre and Zidon, who were the artisans who built the Temple.
<b>to the sea of Jaffa</b> By way of the sea they would bring them.
<b>according to the sanction of</b> Heb. כְּרִשְׁיוֹן as the sanction of the king was upon them to build the Temple. כְּרִשְׁיוֹן is an expression of permission (רְשּׁוּת) derived from רשּׁה ; since from אבה to want, he says [i.e., derives] אֶבְיוֹן, a needy person; and from צבה, to desire, צִבְיוֹן, desire; and from חזה to see, חִזָיוֹן, a vision; and from רעה, רַעְיוֹן, thought; from חבה, חֶבְיוֹן, hiding; and from רשּׁה, he says רְשּׁוּת, permission; like from, ענה, עֱנוּת, affliction; and from שּׁבה, שְּׁבוּת,captivity; and from ראה, רְאוּת, a sight; and from זנה, זְנוּת, harlotry. The result is that רְשּׁוּת and רִשְׁיוֹן are derived from the same root according to the gauge of grammar, and they are the same expression. Menahem, (p. 34) however, associated it with (Ps. 21:3): “and the speech of his lips (וַַַַַאֲרֶשֶּׁת),” but he was not exact with its root. Nevertheless, these two manners [of defining words] are close to each other in their meanings.

Verse 8

<b>in the second month</b> That is the month of Iyar.
<b>from the captivity</b> all those who came from the captivity to Jerusalem.
<b>and they stationed</b> They stationed the Levite singers to harmonize and to recite a song before the builders at the time of the building of the foundation of the Temple.
<b>to conduct</b> Heb. לְנַצֵחַ. These two expressions of נִצוּחַ are harmonies of song, like (Ps. 4:1): “To the conductor (לַּמְנַצֵחַ), a song of David.”

Verse 9

<b>And Jeshua...stood</b> They stood and recited the song together around the ones who did the work of the foundation of the Temple.

Verse 10

<b>And...laid the foundation</b> וְיִסְדוּ This is the strong conjugation of יְסוֹד, like (Ezek. 25:4): “and they will settle (וְיִשְּׁבוּ) their palaces.” Just as וְיִשְּׁבוּ is derived from ישּׁב so is וְיִסְדוּ derived from יסד, and their meaning is, וְיִסְדוּ וְיִשְּׁבוּ in the intensive conjugation with two “yud”s, one for the [continuous] action and one for the radical, and their meaning is that they were laying the foundation, they were settling.
<b>And the builders laid the foundation</b> And the builders were laying the foundation [see above] of the Temple of the Lord at the time [that] they were harmonizing in their song, and they stationed the priests attired with elegant garments with trumpets in their hands to sound them.
<b>and the Levites the sons of Asaph</b> were the singers.
<b>with cymbals</b> Heb. בַּמְצִלְתַּיִם, like (Ps. 150:9): “with loud sounding cymbals (בְּצִלְצְלֵי שָּׁמַע).” They are musical instruments.
<b>through David</b> for they were harmonizing and singing songs of David, the king of Israel.

Verse 11

<b>And they sang aloud</b> Heb. וַיַעֲנוּ, an expression of raising the voice in song, like (Exod. 15: 21): “And Miriam raised her voice in song to them.”
<b>and with thanks</b> and with thanksgivings.
<b>for it is good</b> to give thanks to the Lord.
<b>and the entire people</b> the rest of the people of Israel.
<b>because...was laid</b> They acted with all these rejoicings because of the building of the foundation, which was laid in the House of the Lord.

Verse 12

<b>when its foundation was laid</b> Heb. בְּיָסְדוֹ, with its foundation. With the noun of יוֹסֶד and from יסד, he says בְּיָסְדוֹ, like from חדֶשּׁ, בְּחָדְשּׁוֹ, and from קדֶשּׁ, בְּקָדְשּׁוֹ.
<b>this Temple</b> When they would see the building of this Temple, they would weep because they remembered the large building of the First Temple.
<b>and many</b> who had not seen the building of the First Temple, were rejoicing and shouting for joy with a loud voice, out of their great joy that they had emerged from their exile.

Verse 13

<b>And the people did not recognize</b> Those listeners did not recognize the voice of the shout of joy, because of the voice of the people’s weeping, for the rejoicing people were shouting with a great shout, and the voice of weeping was heard farther and farther away.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<b>the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin</b> They are the nations whom Sannecherib settled in the land Israel, as it says (II Kings 17:24): “And the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylonia and from Cuthah and from Avvah and from Hamath and from Sepharvaim, and he settled them in the cities of Samaria instead of the Children of Israel.”

Verse 2

<b>and said to them, “Let us build with you...”</b> They said this in order that through them the work of the Temple should be disrupted, that they should build no more.
<b>since the days of Esarhaddon the king of Assyria</b> the son of Sannecherib, for after Sannecherib settled them there, as it says (II Kings 19:37, Isa. 37:38): “And he was prostrating himself in the temple of Nisroch his god, and Adramelech and Sharezer, his sons, slew him by the sword etc., and his son Esarhaddon reigned in his stead.”

Verse 3

<b>but we</b> Heb. כִּי, but we alone shall build. This כִּי serves in place of אֶלָּא, but.

Verse 4

<b>the people of the land</b> They are the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin.
<b>were hindering</b> to disrupt them from their work.
<b>from building</b> Heb. לִבְנוֹת, lit. to build, and so (Gen. 41:49): “until one ceased to count (לִסְפֹּר).”

Verse 5

<b>And they would hire</b> Heb. וְסֹכְרִים. This is written with a “sammech,” but its meaning is as though it was written with a “sin,” [meaning] that they would hire advisors to disrupt the work.
<b>all the days of</b> the reign of Cyrus and the reign of Ahasuerus, who reigned after Cyrus, until the second year of Darius, who reigned after Ahasuerus, the work was stopped.

Verse 6

<b>And in the reign of Ahasuerus</b> who reigned after Cyrus; he is the Ahasuerus who took Esther.
<b>they wrote an accusation</b> not to build the Temple.
<b>against the dwellers of Judea and Jerusalem</b> to inform on them and to chide them not to build the Temple.

Verse 7

<b>And in the days of Artaxerxes</b> He is Cyrus, the king of Persia. The numerical value of the letters of כּרֶשּׁ equal the numerical value of the letters of דָּרְיָוֶשּׁ: [כ = 20; ר = 200; שּׁ = 300; total = 520. ד = 4; ר = 200; י = 10; 520 ו = 6; שּׁ = 300; total = 520.] And so we learned in Tractate Rosh Hashanah (3b): “The same one is Cyrus, who is Darius, who is Artaxerxes.” [He was called Cyrus כּרֶשּׁ because he was a worthy (כָּשֵּׁר) king; Artaxerxes, because of the kingdom, and in Seder Olam (ch. 30): “Darius was Artaxerxes (אַרְתַּחְשַּׁשְּׁתָּא), and the entire kingdom was called Artaxerxes, etc.” [meaning that all the kings were called Artaxerxes].
<b>wrote with peace</b> wrote his letter with words of peace.
<b>Mithredath Tabeel</b> This is the name of a man, one of the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin.
<b>and the rest of his colleagues</b> Heb. כְּנָותָיו, his companies and his societies.
<b>to Artaxerxes</b> [as translated,] to Artaxerxes.
<b>and the script of the epistle</b> Heb. וּכְתָב הַנִשְּׁתְּוָן.
<b>written in Aramaic</b> in Aramaic characters.
<b>and explained in Aramaic</b> The script was explained in the Aramaic language.

Verse 8

<b>Rehum was the secretary</b> Rehum was the secretary and the master of words to compose the epistle.
<b>and Shimshai was the scribe</b> And Shimshai was the scribe: he is Shimshai the son of Haman. So it is customary to mention the scribe and the secretary together because they need each other; one composes and dictates, and the scribe writes, as it says (I Kings 4:3): “Eliphoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes, Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahlud, the secretary,” and in another place it says (Isa. 36: 22): “And Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah etc. and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the secretary, came.”
<b>they wrote a letter</b> These two, Rehum and Shimshai, wrote the letter as Mithredath Tabeel had commanded them, and they all were dwellers of the cities of Samaria.
<b>about Jerusalem</b> about the building of the Temple, which is in Jerusalem.
<b>as is stated</b> Aram. כְּנֵמָא, as is stated, and that is similar to the expression of the Gemara: “as we wish to say further.”

Verse 9

<b>Then</b> Aram. אֱדַיִן, equivalent to the Hebrew אָז.
<b>Rehum</b> the name of a man.
<b>the secretary</b> Aram. בְּעֵל טְעֵם secretary and master of words.

<b>the Dinites, the Apharesattechites, etc.</b> All these are names of nations whom Sennacherib repatriated in the cities of Samaria.
<b>the Apharesites</b> They are the Persians whom Sennacherib settled in the cities of Samaria.
<b>the Archevites</b> They are the people of Erech, as it says (Gen. 10:10): “and Erech and Accad and Calneh.”
<b>the Babylonians</b> the people of Babylon.
<b>the Shushanchites</b> the people of Shushan, the capital.
<b>the Elamites</b> the people of Elam. Sennacherib settled all of these peoples in the land of Israel, and all of them were settling and concurring with the commission of this letter.

Verse 10

<b>And the rest of the nations</b> and the rest of the nations that Sennacherib exiled; they have all concurred.
<b>Asenappar</b> Sennacherib.
<b>the great and honored</b> for he was a great and honored king, as it says (Isa. 36:4): “So has the great king, the king of Assyria, said.”

<b>in the cities of Samaria</b> in the cities surrounding Samaria.
<b>and the rest of the other side of the river</b> and the rest of the nations that are on the other side of the river; because the river Euphrates intervenes between the land of Israel and Babylon, those nations that are in Israel are on the opposite side of the river of those found in Babylon.
<b>and Ke’eneth</b> a name of a place; and all the people of Ke’eneth have concurred with the commission of this letter.

Verse 11

<b>This is the meaning of the letter</b> and this is the interpretation of the letter.
<b>the meaning</b> Aram. פַּרְשֶּׁגֶן like (Esther 3:14): “The meaning of (פַּתְשֶּׁגֶן) the writ.
<b>that they sent to him</b> [as translated,] that they sent to him.
<b>to Artaxerxes</b> [as translated,] to Artaxerxes.
<b>Your servants are the people of the other side of the river and Ke’eneth</b> The people of the other side of the river and the people of Ke’eneth are your servants. All the nations counted here are included in this generalization, for they were all on the side of the land of Israel, which is on the opposite side of the river of those dwelling in Babylon, and this is the beginning of the letter: “Your servants are the people of the other side of the river etc.” until, “...you will have no part.”

Verse 12

<b>Let it be known to the king</b> Let it be a known thing to the king.
<b>that the Jews</b> that the Jews who ascended from you upon us have come to Jerusalem.
<b>the rebellious and sinful city they are building</b> [as translated,] a rebellious and sinful city they are building.
<b>the walls they have completed</b> [as translated,] the walls they have completed.
<b>and the walls</b> [as translated,] and the walls.
<b>they have joined</b> Aram. יָחִיטוּ, an expression of a thread, like (Gen. 14:23): “not from a thread, (מִחוּטּ),” for they are “sewing” and joining the walls one to another.

Verse 13

<b>Now let it be known</b> Now let it be known to the king.
<b>that if this city is built</b> [as translated,] that if this city is built.
<b>this</b> [as translated,] this.
<b>and the walls are founded</b> [as translated,] and the walls are founded.
<b>the king’s due, the head tax, or the meal tax</b> They are types of taxes and the money for the head taxes.
<b>they will not give</b> They will no longer pay taxes.
<b>and the tax of the kings will suffer</b> [as translated,] and the tax of the kings will suffer, for they will no longer give tax to the kings.

Verse 14

<b>Now in view of this, that we wish to destroy the Temple</b> Now in view of this matter, that we wish to implement the destruction of the Temple. דִי מְלַח is an expression of destruction and desolation, like Jer. 17:6): “barren (מְלֵחָה) land that is uninhabitable.”
<b>we wish to destroy</b> We wish to demolish and to destroy.
<b>and... the king’s disgrace</b> Aram. וְעַרְוַת מַלְכָּא, lit. and the king’s nakedness.
<b>it is improper</b> Aram. לָא אַרִיךְ, it is improper for us to see. אַרִיךְ means proper, like “Is it proper (אַרִיךְ) or improper (לָא אַרִיךְ)?” in Tractate Succah (44b).
<b>therefore</b> therefore we have sent and notified the king.

Verse 15

<b>That one should search</b> that a seeker should search and seek in the annals of your fathers, the first kings.
<b>and you will find</b> And you will find in the annals, and you will know that this city is a rebellious city, and it injures the kings and the countries.
<b>and they have made rebellion in its midst</b> And its inhabitants were making rebellion in its midst, for Israel would rebel against the kings of the nations.
<b>since days of yore</b> Aram. מִן יוֹמָת עָלְמָא, from days of yore. Since ancient times, it has been their custom to rebel against the kings of the nations.
<b>because of this</b> Because of this, this city was destroyed.

Verse 16

<b>We make known to the king</b> [as translated,] we make known to the king.
<b>that if this city</b> that if this city is built, and its walls are founded.
<b>because of this</b> In view of this and because of this, you will have no part in the entire other side of the river, because Israel will rebel against you and take everything out of your hands.
<b>in the other side of the river</b> That is the entire area of the side of Israel, which is on the other side of the river of those who are in Babylon.

Verse 17

<b>The king sent a word</b> Aram. פִּתְגָּמָא שְּׁלַח מַלְכָּא
<b>to Rehum the secretary</b> to Rehum the secretary, and Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companies, who dwelt in the cities of Samaria, and to the rest of the nations who were on the other side of the river of the side of the land of Israel.
