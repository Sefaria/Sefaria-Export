Rashi on Song of Songs



Chapter 1



Verse 1

“God has spoken once, twice I have heard this” (Psalms 62:12). From one verse, emerge several explanations. [However] in conclusion, a verse does not depart from its literal sense and meaning. Although the Prophets have employed metaphors, let each metaphor be explained simply, each statement fitting its context.
I have seen multiple midrashei aggada (exegetical interpretations): Some organize this entire book in one complete compilation of midrash, while others have pieces scattered in multiple places [...]
“I say that king Shlomo saw prophetically that in the future, Israel will undergo exile after exile, destruction after destruction, and they will mourn in exile for their original glory, remembering the original love by which they was seperated from all other peoples, and they wil say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband, for then I fared better than now’, and they will remember His kindnesses and their own value, and the goodly things promised to them in the eschaton. And Shlomo wrote this sefer prophetically, in the language of a widowed woman who longs for her husband, ‘who clings to her beloved’, remembering how she loved him in her youth, and [she] admits her failings. And even her Beloved is pained by her pain, and remembers the kindness of her youth, the comeliness of her beauty, and the quality of her deeds, in which he was bound up with her in intense love, and He tells her that He does not willfully bring her grief, and nor has she been sent away permanently, for she is still His wife, and He her husband, and he will return to her in the future.”

Verse 7

1. Tell me, you whom my soul loves - Now the Holy Spirit returns and compares her to sheep which are beloved to the shepherd. Israel says before God like a woman to her husband: tell me whom my soul loves, how can you pasture your sheep among these wolves and how can you let them rest in the afternoon, in this exile, which is a difficult time for them just as afternoon is a difficult time for the sheep.
2. For why should I be like one who strays - And if you should say what do you care, it's not your honor (at stake)? Should I be like a mourner wrapped on edge, crying over her sheep?
3. Beside the flocks of your fellows - at the flocks of the rest of the shepherds who are shepherds like you, that is to say, between the mounds of nations that trust in other gods and have kings and rulers leading them.

Verse 8

1. If you don't know - that is the answer of the shepherd.  If you don't know where you are going to go to pasture your sheep, the fairest of women, that the shepherd has ceased leading them.
2. Follow the path of the sheep - I looked at their steps to see where the flocks went, and their tracks are called traichit in Old French, and so too in many places in scripture (Psalm 77)  "And your tracks could not be seen" and (Jeremiah 13) "your limbs exposed" and (Gen. 49) "But he shall raid at their heels," and that is the way you should go.
3. And graze your kids by the tent of the shepherds - between the settlements of the other shepherds where you are.  And this is the allegory: if you don't know, my congregation and my people are the fairest of women among the nations, how shall you be pastured and saved from those who oppress you, to be among them and not be lost, my children observe the ways of your first ancestors who received my Torah and safeguard my keepsakes and commandments and walk in their ways.  And even with that reward you graze your kids at the ministers of nations and thus says Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31) "Erect markers, Set up signposts; Keep in mind the highway, The road that you traveled. Return, Maiden Israel!, etc."

Verse 13

A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me - my beloved has become to me like one who has a bundle of myrrh in his bosom, and I will say to him "here is this bundle that will give a good scent from what you originally lost." So too the Holy One Blessed Be He is reconciled with Israel regarding the Golden Calf and finds atonement for their sins, telling them to give donations for the Mishkan.  They brought gold for the Mishkan and it atoned for the gold of the calf.
Will lodge between my breasts - but since I defrauded him, He said to dwell there.
Between my breasts - between the two poles of the Ark.

Verse 16



Verse 17

The beams of our house are cedars - this is praise for the Mishkan.
Our beams - I wasn't sure if the language used here meant planks or bars (both words used in describing parts of the Mishkan), but I knew that even the language of Mishna we taught that the rehitim of a man's house support it.

Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

Like an apple tree - an apple tree when it is among fruitless trees is beloved more than the others for its fruit is good to taste and smell.
So is my beloved among the youth - among the youth is a metaphor: the Holy Blessed One is the chosen of the gods, therefore "I delight to sit in his shade."  In the Midrash, there is a parable: this apple tree everyone runs away from because it has no shade, so too all the nations ran away from the Holy Blessed One at the giving of the Torah, but "I delight to sit in his shade."

Verse 4

To the banquet room - that is the Tent of Meeting, for there the details and explanations of the Torah were given.
His banner of love was over me - the collective with which he raised me up to him, it is love for me.  I still remember his love and his banner, which is esreit in Old French.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

I adjure you - you the nations.
By gazelles or by hinds - that you will be abandoned and will become prey, like the gazelle and the deer (a to Deut. 15:22).
Do not wake or arouse love - that it is between me and my beloved to change it or swap it, nor should you ask me to give in to temptation after you.
Until it please - as long as she is held in my heart, and he desires me.
Until it please - like the king is at his table, as long as the king is on his table.
Do not wake - do not hate him like (I Samuel 28:16) "became your adversary" and (Daniel 4:16) "its meaning for your foe."
And do not arouse - like the one who protests about the [ownership of] the field, kleiner in Old French.  There are many midrashic parables and they do not fit with the order of things, for I see that Solomon prophesied and spoke about the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah and the Mishkan and the conquering of the land and the Temple and the Exile of Babylon and the Second Temple and its destruction.

Verse 12

1 Los brotes se mostraron en la tierra. Después de Moshé y Aharón, estaban listos para ustedes y para todas sus necesidades.
2 El tiempo del canto llegó. En el futuro de ustedes se dirá el cántico del mar.
3 La voz de la tórtola. Una gran conmoción turística, después de eso vendrá la voz de la tórtola, una voz que llega al tiempo de vuestra salida de Egipto. (12) Los brotes se mostrarán en la tierra, se acercarán días de calor, los árboles se retirarán y las flores saldrán en los caminos peatonales para deleitarlos.

Verse 13









4 El tiempo del canto llegó. Las aves se darán al canto y la voz de la tarde será el andar de las personas. 
5 Y la voz de la tórtola. Literalmente significa que las tórtolas, las palomas y las aves saldrán al camino a cantar como poetas en los días de Pésaj.
