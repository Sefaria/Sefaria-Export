Rashi on Lamentations



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>O how...remained lonely</b> Jeremiah wrote the Book of Lamentations. This is the scroll that Jehoiakim burned on the brazier that was on the fire (sic). It [originally] contained three alphabetical acrostics (Lam. ch. 1): “O how...remained,” (ch. 2) “How...brought darkness,” (ch. 4) “How dim...has become,” and he added to it, (ch. 3) “I am the man,” which contains three alphabetical acrostics, as it is said (Jer. 36:32): “and there were yet added to them many words like those,” three corresponding to three.
<b>lonely</b> solitary, devoid of her inhabitants.
<b>populous</b> Heb. רַבָּתִי עָם, great of people. The “yud” is superfluous, like רַבַּת עָם, for her people were many. There are many Aggadic midrashim [on this verse], but I have come to explain the language of the Scripture according to its literal meaning.
<b>She has become like a widow</b> but not really a widow; rather, like a woman whose husband went abroad and intends to return to her.

Verse 2

<b>She weeps, yea, she weeps</b> weeping twice over the two destructions.
<b>in the night</b> for the Temple was burned at night, as the master said (Ta’an. 29a): “At eventide, they ignited the fire upon it.” Another explanation: because of the night—the night of the weeping of the Spies on the ninth of Av caused it to happen to them (Lam. Rabbah ms. 1:178, Targum, Sanh. 104b, Ta’an. 29a). Another explanation: in the night—for whoever weeps at night, the one who hears his voice weeps along with him (Lam. Rabbah 1:24, Sanh. ad loc.).
<b>and her tears are on her cheek</b> since she weeps constantly.
<b>all her friends</b> those who love her.

Verse 3

<b>Judah went into exile</b> from her land.

<b>and great servitude</b> with which the Chaldeans burdened her.
<b>she settled among the nations</b> and in the place where she was exiled and settled she found no rest.
<b>between the boundaries</b> where there is a high place on either side, and there is no place to flee.
<b>the boundaries</b> Heb. הַמְצָרִים, the boundaries of fields and vineyards. The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah 1:29) explains: between the seventeenth of Tammuz and the ninth of Av.

Verse 4

<b>because no one comes to the appointed season</b> the pilgrims who went up for the festivals.
<b>her maidens grieve</b> Heb. נוּגוֹת, an expression of grief (יָגוֹן), and there is no radical but the “gimmel” alone.

Verse 5

<b>are at ease</b> dwell in tranquility.
<b>has afflicted her</b> caused her grief, and this is an expression of grief.

Verse 6

<b>like harts who did not find pasture</b> like harts who did not find pasture, who have no strength to flee, for their strength has been weakened by hunger.
<b>pursuer</b> Heb. רוֹדֵף. Every רֹדֵף in Scripture is defective (רֹדֵף), but this one is full (רוֹדֵף), for they were pursued with a full pursuit. Therefore the paytan composed “I was fully pursued, but the year of my redemption is missing, (גְאֻלַי).” (Isa. 63: 4): “The year of my redemption (גְאֻלַי) has arrived” is spelled defectively.

Verse 7

<b>Jerusalem recalls</b> in her exile.
<b>the days of her poverty</b> the days of her destruction, which brought her to poverty.
<b>and her miseries</b> Heb. וּמְרוּדֶיהָ. This is an expression of pain, like (Jud. 11:37): “and I wailed (וְיָרַדְתִּי) upon the mountains”; (Ps. 55:3): “I lament (אָרִיד) in my speech, and I moan.”
<b>all her precious things</b> And she remembered all the good of her precious things that were from days of old.
<b>gloating on her desolation</b> Heb. מִשְּׁבַּתֶיהָ. They rejoiced over the cessation of her festivals, her New Moons, and her Sabbaths; and the Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) interprets it as a different expression, that they rested in exile on the Sabbaths and festivals and observed the seventh year, and the heathens ridiculed them and said, “Fools! In your land you did not keep the Sabbatical Year, and now in exile you keep it? In your land, you did not keep the Sabbath, and now in exile you keep it?”

Verse 8

<b>a wanderer</b> Heb. לְנִידָה, an exile, an expression of moving and wandering (נָע וָנָד), esmo(u) vement in Old French, that which moves on.
<b>her shame</b> Heb. עֶרְוָתָה, lit. her nakedness.
<b>she herself sighed</b> Heb. נֶאֶנְחָה is in the passive past tense, sospirer in Old French, to sigh, [a verb]. “They heard that I am sighing (נֶאֶנָחָה) (verse 21) is a noun, sospirose in Old French, one who sighs.

Verse 9

<b>Her uncleanliness is in her skirts</b> This is an expression of disgrace. Her menstrual blood is visible in the skirts of her garments, i.e., her sins are conspicuous; she committed them flagrantly.
<b>she was not mindful of her end</b> When they would sin, they were not mindful of what their end would be. Therefore, “she fell astonishingly.” Her descent was astonishing, bringing about much bewilderment, for everyone was bewildered that this happened to her, something that did not happen to any other city.

Verse 10

<b>The adversary stretched forth his hand</b> Ammon and Moab.
<b>upon all her precious things</b> the Siphrei Torah, which are spoken of as (Ps. 19: 11): “They are to he desired more than gold.” All turned to plunder silver and gold, and they turned upon the Siphrei Torah in order to burn them, because it is written in them, (Deut. 23:4): “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter, etc.”
<b>whom You did command not to enter into Your assembly</b> These are Ammon and Moab.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>let it not happen to you</b> Such a calamity should no longer happen to all those who transgress the Law. Our Sages said (Sanh. 104b): It is derived from here that “kuvlana” has a basis in Scripture. See what He did to me; behold and see, etc.
<b>which has been dealt to me</b> which has been done to me.
<b>[with] which the Lord saddened</b> on the day of His fierce anger. This is an expression [denoting] grief, saddening.

Verse 13

<b>and it broke them</b> Heb. וַיִרְדֶנָה, equivalent to וַיִרֶד אוֹתָה, and it broke it, [referring to each of his bones] through punishment and suffering. Therefore, the “nun” is punctuated with a “dagesh,” so that it is interpreted in the feminine singular, like יַעֲשֶׂנָה, he will do it; יְכַסְמֶנָה, he will gnaw at it; יִרְעֶנָה, will graze upon it; for עֶצֶם, bone, is in the feminine gender, as Scripture states (Ezek. 36:4): הָעֲצָמוֹת הַיְבֵשׁוֹת, the dry bones.” It broke each one. Another explanation: וַיִרְדֶנָה is like (Jud. 14:9): “and he separated it (וַיִרְדֵהוּ) into his hands.” It scrapes and separates the marrow from its midst.

Verse 14

<b>The yoke of my transgressions was marked</b> Heb. נִשְׂקַד. This word has no likeness in Scripture, and in the Aramaic language of the Pesikta (d’Rav Kahana p. 153), they call a goad מַסְקְדָא, an ox goad, and I say that it is equivalent to pointurez in Old French. My transgressions were dotted, spotted, and marked in the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, for a remembrance. Their number and their recompense were not forgotten.
<b>they have become interwoven</b> Heb. יִשְּׂתָּרְגוּ. They became many plaits, and came up on my neck. This is the language of the Mishnah (See M.K. 1:8). We may not girth (מְסָרְגִין) the bedsteads.

Verse 15

<b>The Lord has trampled</b> Heb. סִלָה. He trampled and trod, an expression of (Isa. 62:10): “pave, pave the highway (סֹלוּ סֹלוּ הַמְסִלָה),” [meaning to beat down the road].
<b>He summoned an assembly against me</b> Heb. מוֹעֵד, a gathering of troops to come against me. And our Sages expounded what they expounded (Pes. 77a, Ta’an. 29a, Sanh. 104b): Tammuz of that year was a full (thirty-day) month; [i. e., the Tammuz] of the second year from the Exodus from Egypt. Therefore, the return of the Spies occurred on the night of the ninth of Av, upon which their weeping was established for generations (Ta’an. ad loc., Sanh. ad loc., Sotah 35a).
<b>the Lord has trodden as in a wine press</b> An expression of massacre, like (Isa. 63:3): “A wine press I trod alone.” As one treads grapes to extract their wine, so did He trample the women to extract their blood.

Verse 16

<b>my eye, yea, my eye</b> i.e., my eye constantly sheds tears. The double expression indicates that there was no letup.

Verse 17

<b>Zion spreads out her hands</b> Heb. פֵּרְשָּׂה. Like (Isa. 25:11): “And he shall spread out (וּפֵרַשּׂ) his hands in his midst,” like a person who moves his hands to and fro and demonstrates his pain with them. Another explanation is: Zion broke, an expression of breaking, like (Lam. 4:4): “no one breaks it for them”; (Jer. 16:7): “and they shall not break [bread] (יִפְרְסוּ) for them in mourning,” to console him for his dead [kinsman]. So did Menachem classify it (Machbereth Menachem p. 146). And in the language of the Mishnah (Ber. 37a), the broken piece of bread (פְּרוּסָה) is intact. And it means that Zion was in pain like a person who clasps his hands and breaks them. I found an addendum.
<b>the Lord has commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries shall be round about him</b> He commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries would surround him. Even when they were exiled to Babylon and to Assyria, Sennacherib exiled their enemies, Ammon and Moab, and settled them beside them, and they taunted them, as is stated in Tractate Kiddushin (72a): Humania was in Babylon, entirely occupied by Ammonites.
<b>an outcast</b> Heb. לְנִדָה, for an outcast and a disgrace.

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>I called to my lovers</b> Heb. לַמְאַהֲבַי, to those who make themselves appear as lovers.
<b>[but] they deceived me</b> e.g., the children of Ishmael, who went forth toward the exiles when the captors were leading them on the road nearby, as if they were compassionate toward them. And they brought them various kinds of salty foods and inflated skin flasks. They [the Jews] thought that these were [flasks of] wine, so they ate and became thirsty and wished to drink, and when they untied the flask with their teeth, the air entered their intestines and they died. This is what Scripture says (Isa. 21:13f.): “In the forest in Arabia you shall lodge, etc. Bring water toward the thirsty! The inhabitants of the land of Tema came before the wanderer with bread.”
<b>to revive their souls</b> so that they should revive their souls.

Verse 20

<b>burn</b> Heb. חֳמַרְמָרוּ, they became shriveled, and there is an expression like this in the language of the Mishnah (Hul. 3:3): “It fell into the fire and its intestines were scorched (וְנֶחְמְרוּ).”
<b>in the house it is like death</b> Within the house was fear of demons and destructive beings and angels of death, and from without, the enemy’s sword was bereaving them.

Verse 21

<b>that You have done it</b> You caused them to hate me when You separated me from their food and from their drink and from intermarrying with them. Had I intermarried with them, they would have had compassion upon me and upon their daughters’ sons.
<b>You had brought the day that You proclaimed</b> If only You had brought upon them the appointed day that You proclaimed upon me.
<b>and let them be like me</b> in distress.

Verse 22

<b>May all their wickedness come before You</b> May all their iniquities be remembered and counted before You.
<b>and deal with them</b> Heb. וְעוֹלֵל, and do, like (Prov. 20:11): “Also a child can disguise himself with his deeds (בְּמַעֲלָלָיו)”; (Jer. 32:19): “and in accordance with the fruit of his deeds (מַעֲלָלָיו).”

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>brought darkness</b> Heb. יָעִיב, brought darkness, as Scripture states (I Kings 18:45): “the heavens grew dark with clouds (בְּעָבִים).”
<b>from heaven to earth</b> After He lifted them up to heaven, He cast them to earth all at once, and not little by little, [as] from a lofty roof to a deep pit.
<b>His footstool</b> that is the Temple.

Verse 2

<b>the habitations of Jacob</b> Heb. נְאוֹת, the houses of Jacob, an expression of נָוֶה, a dwelling.
<b>He has struck [them] to the ground</b> He humbled them to the ground.
<b>He has profaned the kingdom and its princes</b> These are the Israelites, who were called (Exod. 19:6): “a kingdom of priests.”
<b>and its princes</b> There is a Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah 2:5) [that states that] these are the heavenly princes [whose assignments] He changed. The one appointed over fire He appointed over water, and He changed all the appointees because there were among the wicked of Israel those who knew the Ineffable Name, and they relied [upon the fact] that they could adjure the heavenly princes to save them from fire, from water and from the sword. Now, when he would adjure the prince of fire by his name, he would reply, “This dominion is not in my hands,” and similarly, all of them.

Verse 3

<b>He has withdrawn His right hand</b> He withdrew Himself as though withdrawing His right hand from waging war on behalf of His children.

Verse 4

<b>He has bent His bow</b> Heb. דרך lit. trod. Since this is the procedure of those who bend the bow, who are strong, to place their foot upon them when he bends them; it is therefore worded as an expression of treading.
<b>He has poured out His fury like fire</b> The arrangement of the words is as follows: He poured out His anger, which is like fire, for we do not find pouring of fire, except in conjunction with anger, as it is written (Ps. 79:6): “Pour out Your wrath upon the nations.”

Verse 5

<b>and He increased in the daughter of Judah</b> He increased in the congregation of Judah.
<b>pain and wailing</b> Heb. תַּאֲנִיָה וַאֲנִיָה, pain and wailing.
<b>and He increased</b> Heb. וַיֶרֶב. The “yud” is vowelized with a small “pattah” (seggol), which is an expression of increasing others. (Exod. 1:20): “and the people multiplied (וַיִרֶב) and became very strong,” is vowelized with a “hirik”, which is an expression meaning that he himself increased, and so every word whose radical ends with a “hey,” e.g. פנה, to turn, זנה to go astray, בכה, to weep, are vowelized in that manner when the “hey” is missing, when it speaks of itself [i.e., the simple (קַל) conjugation, not the causative], e.g. (Exod. 7:23): “And Pharaoh turned (וַיִפֶן).” But when he speaks of others [i.e, the causative conjugation (הפעיל)], it is vowelized with a small “pattah” (seggol), e.g. (Jud. 15:4): “and he turned (וַיֶפֶן) tail to tail”; (II Kings 25: 21): “And Judah went into exile (וַיִגֶל) from his land”; (ibid. 18:11): “and the king of Babylon (sic) exiled (וַיֶגֶל) Israel to Assyria.”

Verse 6

<b>He stripped</b> Heb. וַיַחְמֹס, an expression of cutting, and so (Job 15:33): “He will cast off (יַחְמֹס) like a vine”; (Jer. 13:22): “your steps were cut off (נֶחְמְסוּ).”
<b>like a garden</b> as they cut off the vegetables of a garden.
<b>His Tabernacle</b> Heb. שֻׂכּוֹ, His habitation. It is written שֻׂכּוֹ [with a “sin” rather than with a “sammech”, intimating] that He assuaged (שִּׁכֵּךְ) His anger against His children with the destruction of His House. Thus it is interpreted in the Midrash of Lamentations (Lam. Rabbah).
<b>and laid in ruins His Meeting Place</b> The Holy of Holies, where He would meet with His children, as it is said (Exod. 25:22): “And I will meet (וְנוֹעַדְתִּי) you there.”
<b>king and priest</b> King Zedekiah and Seraiah the High Priest.

Verse 7

<b>He has abolished</b> Heb. נִאֵר, and so, (Ps. 89:40): “You abrogated (נֵאַרְתָּה) the covenant of Your servant.”
<b>as on a day of a festival</b> For they were making merry and singing in its midst with a loud voice. So did the enemies let out a cry of joy when it was destroyed.

Verse 8

<b>The Lord determined to destroy</b> It is already many days since this entered His mind, as it is written (Jer. 32:31): “For this city has aroused My anger and My wrath until this day, to remove it from before My face.”
<b>He stretched out a line</b> of judgment to be punished for our iniquities.

<b>rampart and wall</b> a large wall and a small wall, a low wall opposite a high wall.

Verse 9

<b>Her gates are sunk into the ground</b> The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) states: Because they imparted honor to the Ark, as it is said (Ps. 24:9): “[You] gates, lift up your heads.” Therefore, no one had any power over them, and they sank into the ground (Lam. Rabbah). Our Sages (Sotah 9a) said that they were David’s handiwork; therefore, the enemies did not have any power over them.
<b>there is no more teaching</b> There is no one among them who gives instruction.

Verse 10

<b>sit on the ground, etc.</b> [This is to be understood] according to its apparent meaning. But the Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) states: Nebuchadnezzar caused them to sit on the ground when Zedekiah rebelled against him and transgressed his oath. He came and stationed himself in Daphne of Antioch, and sent for the Sanhedrin, and they came toward him. He recognized that they were men of imposing appearance and sat them down in golden chairs. He said to them, “Recite your Torah for me chapter by chapter and translate it for me.” As soon as they reached the chapter dealing with vows, he said to them, “What if he wishes to retract, can he retract?” They said to him, “Let him go to a sage, and he will absolve him of it.” He said to them, “If so, you absolved Zedekiah of his oath.” He gave the order, and they pushed them off [their seats] and sat them on the ground. They then tied the hair of their heads to the tails of horses and dragged them.

Verse 11

<b>my innards burn</b> Heb. חֳמַרְמְרוּ, regrizi(l)lerent in Old French, have shriveled up. It is usual that when a person casts intestines into the fire, they shrivel up and burn.
<b>faint</b> Heb. בֵּעָטֵף, pa(s)mer in Old French, to faint, swoon.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>What shall I testify for you? What shall I compare to you</b> to say to you, “Why do you wonder about your destruction? Didn’t that also happen to such and such a nation, just like you?”
<b>What can I liken to you, that I may comfort you</b> When trouble befalls a person, [others] say to him, “This also happened to so-and-so.” These are consolations for him.

Verse 14

<b>false and senseless visions</b> words that have no taste, and in Old French aflestrimant, insipidity, sickliness.
<b>and they have not exposed your iniquity</b> to reprove you to your face about your way.
<b>to straighten out your backsliding</b> Heb. לְהָשִּׁיב שְׁבוּתֵךְ, an expression of (Jer. 8:5) שּׁוֹבְבָה (ibid. 3:14) שּׁוֹבְבִים, backsliding; (Isa. 57:17): “and he went rebelliously (שּׁוֹבָב).”
<b>misleading oracles</b> They misled you away from Me.

Verse 15

<b>they hissed</b> To blow with the mouth, siblir in Old French, to hiss, whistle. It is customary for a person to do this when he sees an important thing that was ruined.
<b>the perfection of beauty</b> All beauty was hers.

Verse 16

<b>All your enemies have opened their mouths wide against you</b> Why did Scripture place the “pey” before the “ayin”? Because they were saying with their mouths (פֶּה) what they did not see with their eyes (עַיִן).

Verse 17

<b>He has carried out His word</b> He completed His decree, like (Job 6:9): “let loose His hand and finish me off (וִיבַצְעֵנִי).”
<b>which He decreed long ago</b> that which is written in the Torah (Lev. 26: 18): “and I shall continue to chastise you sevenfold.”

Verse 18

<b>respite</b> Heb. פוּגַת, an expression of letting up, tresalemant in Old French, respite, let up, like (Gen. 45:26): “and his heart grew faint (וַיָפָג).”
<b>the pupil of your eye</b> the black area of the eye, which is called prunelle in French, pupil.

Verse 19

<b>at the beginning of the watches</b> [i.e., at the beginning of the final] two parts of the night, for the night is divided into three parts, as our Rabbis stated in Tractate Berachoth (3).
<b>who faint</b> pגmיs in French, faint, swooning.

Verse 20

<b>children that are petted</b> tender children, who are still being raised with their mothers’ pampering. And our Sages expounded on Doeg the son of Joseph, whose mother would measure him with [her] fists every day, to give gold to the Temple according to how much he grew, and she ultimately devoured him.
<b>Will priest and prophet be slain in the Sanctuary of the Lord</b> The holy spirit answers them, “Now was it proper for you that you slew Zechariah the son of Jehoiada?” as is written in (II) Chronicles (24:22), that he reproved them when they came and prostrated themselves to Joash, and deified him. (ibid. verse 20): “And the spirit of God enveloped Zechariah the son of Jehoiada.” He was a priest and a prophet, and they slew him in the forecourt.

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>You have summoned...as though it were a feast day</b> Heb. תִּקְרָא, like קָרָאתָ, and this is the present tense.
<b>my neighbors</b> my evil neighbors, to gather about me to destroy.
<b>those whom I dandled and reared, my enemy exterminated</b> The children whom I dandled and reared, the enemy came and exterminated.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>I am the man who has seen affliction</b> Jeremiah lamented, saying, “I am the man who has seen affliction,” who has seen affliction more than all the prophets who prophesied concerning the destruction of the Temple, for the Temple was not destroyed in their days, but it was in my days.
<b>by the rod of His wrath</b> of the One who chastises and smites, i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>Only against me would He repeatedly</b> I alone am constantly smitten, for the entire repetition of His blows is upon me.

Verse 4

<b>He has made my flesh and my skin waste away</b> Heb. בִּלָה, like (Isa. 44:19): “to rotten wood (לְבוּל עֵץ).” Another explanation: He has made my flesh and my skin waste away, like (ibid. 51:6): “And the earth shall rot away (תִּבְלֶה) like a garment,” i.e., both young and old lay on the ground with neither pillow nor cushion, and their flesh wore out when they were going into exile.

Verse 5

<b>and encompassed</b> He encompassed me.
<b>gall</b> Heb. רֹאשּׁ, like (Deut. 29: “gall (רֹאשּׁ) and wormwood.” The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabhah), states: רֹאשּׁ refers to Nebuchadnezzar in the exile of Jehoiachin. <b>travail</b> Nebuzaradan, who completed the blow in the days of Zedekiah, and he wearied me.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>He has fenced me in</b> He has made a wall opposite me so that I should be imprisoned.
<b>so that I cannot get out</b> He stationed camps and troops of soldiers lying-in-wait around me.
<b>He has made my chains heavy</b> He made heavy fetters for my feet so that I would be unable to walk, f(i)eryes in Old French, chains.

Verse 8

<b>He shuts out my prayer</b> He shut the windows of the sky before it.

Verse 9

<b>He has made my paths crooked</b> If I wish to go out, I do not go out on roads paved in a straight way, because of the enemies, but I go out on a crooked road.

Verse 10

<b>He is to me a bear lying in wait</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, turned into a bear lying in wait for me.

Verse 11

<b>He scattered thorns on my ways</b> Heb. סוֹרֵר, an expression of סִירִים, thorns. סוֹרֵר means that He “thorned” them, He scattered thorns on my ways.
<b>He caused me to spread my legs</b> Heb. וַיְפַשְׁחֵנִי, an expression of spreading the legs. One who passes on roads that are not cleared must widen his stride, and there is an example of this in the language of the Gemara (M.K. 10b): “The one who pruned (דְפָשַׁח) a date palm” [meaning that he separated the branches from the trunk].

Verse 12

<b>and set me up as a target</b> He set me up opposite His arrows to shoot at me like a target, asenayl in Old French, target.

Verse 13

<b>the arrows of His quiver</b> arrows that are placed within the quiver, called cuyvre, quiver.

Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>He has made...grind</b> Heb. וַיַגְרֵס, and He broke, and an example is (Ps. 119.20): “My soul is crushed (גָרְסָה)”; and similarly (Lev. 2:14): “ground (גֶרֶשּׂ) when still fresh.”
<b>on gravel</b> Heb. בֶּחָצָץ, fine pebbles that are in the midst of the dust, for the exiles would knead their dough in the pits that they would dig in the ground, and the gravel would enter it, as the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Ezekiel (12:3), “Make yourself implements for exile,” in which to drink and in which to knead a small cake, so that they should learn and do likewise, as it is stated (ibid. 24:24): “And Ezekiel will be to you for a sign,” but they ridiculed him and did not do so; [so] their teeth were ultimately broken.
<b>and caused me to wallow</b> He turned me over in ashes like a vessel inverted on its mouth, adenter in Old French, to throw flat on one’s face. There is a similar word in the Mishnah (sic) (Yev. 107b): Pishon the camel driver measured with an inverted (כְּפוּשָּׁה) measure.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>So I said, Gone is my life</b> Heb. נִצְחִי. I said to myself in the midst of my many troubles, “My world and my hope are gone.”

Verse 19

<b>and my misery</b> Heb. וּמְרוּדִי, compleynt, wailing.

Verse 20

<b>well remembers</b> My soul [well remembers] my affliction and my misery and is bowed down within me. This is the simple meaning according to the context of the verse. The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah), however, [explains it as follows:] I know that You will ultimately remember what was done to me, but my soul is bowed down within me waiting for the time of remembrance. On this the liturgical poet based [his poem]: “With this I know that You have to remember, but my soul is bowed down within me until You remember.”

Verse 21

<b>This I reply to my heart</b> After my heart said to me that my hope from the Lord was gone, I will reply this to my heart, and I will continue to hope. Now what is it that I will reply to my heart?

Verse 22

<b>Verily, the kindnesses of the Lord never cease</b> and the entire section until (v. 39): “Why should [a living man] complain? etc.”
<b>Indeed, His mercies never fail</b> Heb. כִּי לא תָמְנוּ, like כִּי לֹא תָמוּ. And some explain: כִּי לֹא תָמְנוּ, [for we have not ended] like (Num. 17:27): “Are we then altogether given (תָמְנוּ) to die?” It is [because of] the kindnesses of the Lord that we have not ended, that we have not perished because of our iniquities.

Verse 23

<b>They are new every morning</b> Your kindnesses are renewed from day to day.
<b>great is Your faithfulness</b> Your promise is great, and it is a great thing to believe in You that You will fulfill and keep what You promised us.

Verse 24

<b>“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul</b> The Lord is my portion; it is therefore proper that I should hope in Him.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>It is good that one should wait quietly</b> Heb. טוֹב וְיָחִיל וְדוּמָם. The “vav” of וְיָחִיל is superfluous like the “vav” of (Gen. 36:24): “Ayyah (וְאַיָּה) and Anah.” It is good that a man wait and remain silent and hope for the Lord’s salvation.

Verse 27



Verse 28

<b>Let him sit solitary</b> Whoever was befallen by mourning and trouble should sit solitary and hope for the best.
<b>and wait</b> Heb. וְיִדֹם, an expression of waiting, like (I Sam. 14:9): “If they say thus to us, Wait! (דֹמוּ)” about Jonathan.
<b>for He has laid [it] upon him</b> for the Lord of decrees has laid this decree upon him.

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b>For the Lord will not cast [him] off forever</b> It is therefore good to wait.

Verse 32

<b>Though he cause grief</b> If a man brings grief upon himself because of his iniquity, afterwards—He will yet have compassion according to the abundance of His kindness.
The words הוֹגָה וְיָגֶה are expressions of תּוּגָה, grief.

Verse 33

<b>For He does not willingly afflict or grieve the sons of man</b> from His heart and from His will, but the iniquity causes [it].

Verse 34

<b>[Or] crush under His feet</b> This refers back to, “For He does not willingly afflict to crush under His feet, etc., or pervert the righteous judgment of a man, or distort a man’s dispute, etc.” All these the Lord did not approve. He did not approve of them, and it did not enter His thoughts to do so.

Verse 35



Verse 36

<b>does not approve</b> He does not approve that the heavenly tribunal should distort a person’s dispute, like (Gen. 20:10): “What did you see that you did, etc.”

Verse 37



Verse 38

<b>[And] by the command of the Most High, etc.</b> And if you attempt to say that this evil did not come to me from His hand, that it is happenstance that it has befallen me, this is not so, for both evil occurrences and good occurrences—who has commanded and they came to pass, unless the Lord ordained? And by His command both evil and good come. But “why should a living man complain? A man for his sins.” Every man should complain about his sins, because they are what bring the evil upon him. (<b>By the command of the Most High, neither good nor evil come</b> Said Rabbi Johanan: Since the day that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, [Deut. 30:15]: “See, I have set before you today life and good, etc.,” neither evil nor good has come from His command, but the evil comes by itself to the one who commits evil and the good to the one who does good. [Lam. Rabbah].) Therefore, what should a man complain about, if not about his sins?

Verse 39



Verse 40



Verse 41

<b>Let us lift up our hearts to our hands</b> When we lift up our hands to heaven, let us also lift up our hearts with them, to return, to bring back our hearts before the Omnipresent, blessed be He. (Lam. Rabbah ms.). Another explanation: <b>to our hands</b> to the clouds, to the heavens, as Scripture states (I Kings 18:44): “There is a cloud as small as a man’s palm, rising.” And similarly, (Job 36:32): “Over the clouds (כַּפַּיִם) He covers the rain.” And [according to] the Midrash of our Sages: Let us lift up our hands sincerely to the Holy One, blessed be He, like one who washes his hands with cleanliness, who casts from his hands all contamination, for “he who confesses [his sins] and abandons [them] will obtain mercy, but he who confesses [his sins] but does not abandon [them] is like one who immerses himself while holding a [dead] reptile in his hand.”

Verse 42

<b>We have rebelled and have been disob edient</b> This is our way, [that we sinned] because of the evil inclination.
<b>You have not forgiven</b> And for You, forgiveness is fitting, for so is Your way.

Verse 43

<b>You have enveloped Yourself with anger</b> You set anger up to be a barrier between You and us, and You pursued us with it.

Verse 44



Verse 45

<b>scum and refuse</b> That is נִיעַ in the language of the Mishnah (B.K. 3b), כִּיחוֹ וְנִיעוֹ, his phlegm and his mucus, which is drawn out from the lungs and emitted from the throat.
<b>You make us</b> This is in the present tense.

Verse 46



Verse 47

<b>We had terror and pitfalls</b> When we fled because of the terror, we fell into the pit.
<b>desolation</b> Heb. הַשֵׁאת, an expression of desolation (שְּׁאִיָה).

Verse 48



Verse 49

<b>without respite</b> without change or cessation.

Verse 50



Verse 51

<b>My eye sullies my soul more than all the daughters of my city</b> Jeremiah was from a priestly family, and he said, “My eye, with its tears, sullies my face over myself more than all the daughters of my city.”
<b>sullies</b> Heb. עוֹלְלָה, an expression of sullying, like (Job 16:15): “and sullied (וְעוֹלַלְתִּי) my radiance.”
<b>more than all the daughters of my city</b> My family has more to cry for than all the daughters of the city, for it was chosen for sanctity and for the service of the Holy One, blessed be He, over all Israel.

Verse 52



Verse 53

<b>They have confined my life in the dungeon</b> Heb. בַּבּוֹר, in prison.
<b>They have confined</b> Heb. צָמְתוּ, they bound, like the junction (צֹמֶת) of the sinews (Hul. 76a); (Song 4:1): “from within your kerchief (לְצַמָתֵךְ),” estreyture in Old French, restriction, tightening.
<b>and have cast a stone upon me</b> on the mouth of the dungeon. That is what they did to Daniel, and Jeremiah foresaw it with the holy spirit.
<b>They have confined my life in the dungeon</b> And although they confined my life in the dungeon so that I cannot ascend from within it, they did not pay attention to this until they cast a stone upon me.

Verse 54

<b>Water flowed, etc.</b> When a person enters water up to his waist, he still has hope, but if the water flows over his head, he then says, “My hope is gone,” but I do not do this, for “I called, etc.”
<b>Water flowed</b> the heathens.

Verse 55



Verse 56



Verse 57

<b>You did draw near when I called on You</b> So were You accustomed in the early days to draw near to me on the day I called.

Verse 58

<b>You did plead my cause</b> in days past.

Verse 59

<b>You have seen wrong done to me, O Lord</b> In this trouble, that my enemies wronged me.
<b>judge my cause</b> as You have already done [in times past].

Verse 60



Verse 61



Verse 62



Verse 63



Verse 64



Verse 65

<b>Give them a weakness of heart</b> Heb. מְגִנַת לֵב, a breaking of the heart, as Scripture says: (Hosea 11:8): “I shall break you (אֲמַגֶנְךָ), O Israel”; (Gen. 14:20): “who broke (מִגֵן) your adversaries in your hand.” Another explanation: מְגִנַתלֵב, stopping up of the heart, trouble and sighing, which are like a shield against the heart. But he who explains it as an expression of grief (תּוּגָה וְיָגוֹן) is in error, for there is no “nun” in this word, for the “nun” in יָגוֹן is not a radical, but is like the “nun” of הָמוֹן from the root of הָמוּ גוֹיִם and like קָלוֹן from the root of נִקְלֶה, and like the “nun” of צִיוֹן from the root of צִיָה and so the “nun” of שִּׁבְרוֹן from the root of שֶּׁבֶר (and like the “nun” of שִּׁגָעוֹן, שְּׁמָמוֹן. It appears to me that this is the correct reading, and this is easy to understand.)
<b>Your curse</b> An expression of (Isa. 19: 13): נוֹאֲלוּ שָׂרֵי צֹעַן, “The princes of Zoan have become foolish.”

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<b>How dim the gold has become</b> This elegy was recited about Josiah, as it is stated (II Chronicles 35: 25): “Behold it is written in the Book of Lamentations,” and with it he joined, in the midst of the elegy, the rest of the children of Zion.
<b>dim</b> Heb. יוּעַם, dim, as in (Lev. 13:6) where כֵּהָה is translated by the Targum as עַמְיָא.
<b>gold</b> the appearance of a face that shines like gold.
<b>changed</b> Heb. יִשְּׁנֶא, changes its appearance.
<b>the gold jewelry</b> Heb. הַכֶּתֶם. A collection of beautiful gold articles used as ornamentation is called ַכֶּתֶם.
<b>The holy stones</b> children who shine like precious stones, and the Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) [states]: Every fourth part [of a log] of blood that came out of Josiah with each arrow that they thrust into him, Jeremiah buried in its place, and he called out concerning it, “the holy stones are scattered.”

Verse 2

<b>praised with gold</b> who were praised and equated with gold. Whoever saw them said, “See, the complexion of these is like the appearance of gold,” and so, (Job 28:16): “It cannot be praised (תְסֻלֶה) with jewelry of Ophir”; (ibid. 19): “it cannot be praised (תְסֻלֶה) with jewelry of fine gold”; (Ps. 68: 5): “praise (סֹלוּ) Him Who rides in Aravoth”; these are expressions of praise and value.
<b>earthen pitchers</b> Heb. נִבְלֵי, earthen pitchers in which they pour wine, like wine flasks. (Jer. 48:12): “and they shall smash their jars (נִבְלֵיהֶם).”

Verse 3

<b>Even the sea-monsters</b> Even though it is cruel, it offers the breast. When it sees its hungry offspring coming from afar, it uncovers its breasts from their sheath, for it has a cover over its breasts, and draws them out so that its offspring should not see them covered up and retreat. And then they suckle their young.
<b>the daughter of my people has become cruel</b> They see their children crying for bread, and they do not break it for them, for their own lives come before their children’s lives because of the hunger.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>they that were reared on crimson</b> on colored garments.
<b>they that were reared</b> Heb. הָאֱמֻנִים. An expression similar to (Esther 2:7): “And he brought up (אֹמֵן) Hadassah.”
<b>clasp the dunghills</b> heaps of dung; they lie on the dunghills in the street.

Verse 6

<b>The iniquity of my people is greater, etc.</b> Their punishment proves about them that their iniquity is greater than that of Sodom.
<b>which was overthrown as in a moment</b> The distress of Sodom was not prolonged; it was overthrown as in one moment.
<b>and no hands fell on her</b> [i.e.,] the hands of the enemy, but through angels it was overthrown. There are also Aggadic midrashim, but they do not fit the sequence of the verses.

Verse 7

<b>Her Nazirites were purer</b> Heb. נְזִירֶיהָ, her princes, like נֶזֶר and כֶּתֶר, a crown, but I say that [it means] real Nazirites, who had long hair and were remarkably handsome, and the antecedent is “the daughter of my people.”
<b>their appearance was ruddier than coral</b> Those whose appearance was ruddier than coral and whose forms were like sapphire—their complexions became darker than charcoal.

Verse 8

<b>than charcoal</b> Heb. מִשְּׁחוֹר. This is charcoal.
<b>appearance</b> Heb. עֶצֶם, an expression of appearance, like (Exod. 24:10): “like the appearance of (וּכְעֶצֶם) the heavens in purity”; couleur in French, color, complexion.
<b>is shriveled</b> Heb. צָפַד, shriveled and adhered, and there is no similar word.

Verse 9

<b>for they ooze, pierced, etc.</b> The victims of hunger were swollen from the smell of the fruits of the field, for the enemies would roast meat on the grass outside the wall, and the aroma would go into those swollen from hunger, and their stomachs would split, and their feces would ooze. Now this is a more ignoble death than those who are slain by the sword.
<b>pierced</b> Heb. מְדֻקָרִים. Being split either by the swelling of hunger or by the stabbing of the sword is called דְקִירָה, piercing.
<b>by the fruits of the field</b> Because of the roots and grasses that they gathered and ate, their feces increased and were loathsome.

Verse 10

<b>food</b> Heb. לְבָרוֹת, for food, like (II Sam. 12:17): “neither did he eat (בָרָה) bread with them”; (ibid. 3: 35): “to serve (לְהַבְרוֹת) David bread.”

Verse 11

<b>The Lord has spent His fury</b> which burned in Him for many years; He now spent it when He avenged Himself upon them.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>for the sins of her prophets</b> [Because of the sins of her] false [prophets], this evil has befallen her.

Verse 14

<b>The blind stagger through the streets</b> When the blind would walk in the street, they staggered, and their feet slipped on the blood of the slain, whom the wicked were slaying in their midst.
<b>they are defiled with blood</b> They were so sullied with blood that those near them could not touch their clothes, and would therefore call out to them.

Verse 15

<b>Depart</b> from us, you unclean ones, who are sullied with blood.
<b>for they are foul</b> Heb. נָצוּ, an expression of foulness and filth, like (Lev. 1:16): “its crop, בְּנֹצָתָה,” which is translated by the Targum as בְּאוּכְלֵיה. So did Menahem associate it (not found in our editions of Machbereth).
<b>even slipping</b> They slipped in the blood.

Verse 16

<b>The anger of the Lord divided them</b> Heb. פְּנֵי, lit. the face of. The angry face of the Holy One, blessed be He, divided them and dispersed them among the heathens, because they did not respect the presence of the priests when they were in their [state of] tranquility.

Verse 17

<b>Our eyes still strained for our futile help</b> When the evil befell us, our eyes were still looking forward to Pharaoh’s army, concerning whom it is said (Isa. 30:7): “And the Egyptians help in vain and to no purpose,” for they would promise us aid but they would not come, as it is stated concerning them (Jer. 37:7): “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to aid you, is returning to its land, Egypt.” We find in Midrash Kinoth that they were coming in ships. The Holy One, blessed be He, signaled to the sea and caused inflated flasks like human intestines to float before them, moving around in the water. They said to each other, “These flasks are our forefathers, the men of Egypt who drowned in the sea because of these Jews, and we are going out to aid them?” They stopped and turned around.
<b>we hoped</b> Heb. צִפִּינוּ, we waited.

Verse 18

<b>They dogged our steps</b> Heb. צָדוּ. Our enemies stalked our steps and prevented us from walking in our streets, like (Exod. 21:13): “but if he did not lurk (צָדָה)”;(I Sam. 24:12): “but you are stalking (צֹדֶה) my soul.”

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>The breath of our nostrils, the Lord’s anointed</b> That is Josiah, as it is stated in Chronicles (II Chron. 35:25): “And Jeremiah lamented Josiah.”
<b>in their pits</b> in the pits that they dug.

Verse 21

<b>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom</b> Jeremiah prophesied about the destruction of the Second Temple, which the Romans would destroy.
<b>Rejoice and be glad</b> for the time being, but ultimately, the cup of retribution will pass also over you, and you will become drunk from it.
<b>and vomit</b> Heb. וְתִתְעָרִי, like (Gen. 24:20): “and she emptied (וַתְּעַר) her pitcher.”

Verse 22

<b>[The punishment of] your iniquity is complete, O daughter of Zion</b> You suffered for all your sins.
<b>He will no longer send you into exile</b> from the exile of Edom and further.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>Our water we have drunk for payment</b> We were afraid to draw water from the river because of the enemies; we therefore bought [it] from them with money.

Verse 5

<b>We are pursued [with a yoke] on our necks</b> because of the yoke of hard labor.
<b>we toil</b> to gather money and property.
<b>but it does not remain with us</b> [the fruits of] our toil [do not remain] in our hands, because the enemies would collect and seize everything for taxes, head taxes, and property taxes.

Verse 6

<b>We have stretched out our hands to Egypt</b> It is customary for a falling person who wishes to stand up to stretch out a hand to someone nearby to help him. Here too, we stretched out a hand to Egypt that they should help us.
<b>[and to] Assyria to get enough food</b> that they sate us with their bread.
<b>We have stretched out</b> Heb. נָתַנוּ, like נָתַנְנוּ. The dagesh in the “nun” takes the place of the second “nun,” and so (I Chron. 29:14): “For all is from You, and from Your hand we have given it (נָתַנוּ) to You”; and so (Gen. 34:16): “and we will give (וְנָתַנוּ) our daughters to you.”

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>With our lives we bring our bread</b> with the peril of our soul. We were endangered when we would bring our food from the field because of the sword of the wilderness.

Verse 10

<b>is parched</b> Heb. נִכְמַרוּ, became heated, and so (Gen. 43:30): “for his mercies were stirred up (נִכְמְרוּ)”; and in the language of the Gemara there are many instances [of the use of this word]: (Yev. 97a): “a heating vessel (כּוֹמֶר) of olives”; (Pes. 58a): “for the heating (מִכְמָר) of the flesh.
<b>the heat of hunger</b> Heb. זַלְעֲפוֹת,” heat, like (Ps. 11:6): “and a burning wind (רוּחַ זִלְעָפוֹת)”; an expression of burning.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Young men carried the millstones</b> When the enemies led them away in neck irons, they would place millstones and burdens on their shoulders in order to tire them. Similarly: and youths fail under [loads of] wood, meaning that their strength failed. The expression of failing applies to the weakening of the strength, as is stated in Ezra (Neh. 4:4), “And Judea said: The porter’s strength has failed (כָּשַּׁל) .” Similarly, (above 1:14) “and caused my strength to fail (הִכְשִּׁיל).”

<b>[But] You, O Lord</b> we know that You will remain forever. Now since that is so...

Verse 20

<b>Why do You forget us forever</b> Have You not sworn to us Yourself that just as You exist, so does Your oath exist?

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>For if You have utterly rejected us</b> because we have sinned, You should not have been exceedingly wroth as much as You were wroth.
<b>Restore us...O Lord</b> Since he concludes with words of reproof, he had to repeat the preceding verse again, and so it is in Isaiah, the Twelve Prophets, and Ecclesiastes.
