Rashi on Lamentations



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>How can it be that she sits in isolation.</b> Yirmiyahu wrote the book of Lamentations. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Because Chapter 3 of Eichah begins with Yirmiyahu writing, “I am the man,” one might mistakenly think that is the beginning of Yirmiyahu’s writing, therefore Rashi states that he wrote the entire Book of Lamentations [=Eichah]. (Sifsei Chachomim) </i> This is the scroll that Yehoyakim burned on the hearth.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Yirmiyahu 36:23. </i> It contained three<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The three acrostics respond to the three tragedies that occurred: the physical exile of the Bnei Yisroel, the departure of the Shchinah and the loss of Eretz Yisroel. (Yalkut Me’am Lo’ez) </i> alphabetical acrostics:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The alphabetical acrostic symbolizes the Bnei Yisroel’s transgression of the Torah which was written with the letters of the Aleph Beis. (Sifsei Chachomim) </i> “Oh how can it be that she sits [in isolation],”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Eichah 1:1. </i> “How can it be [that God] has cast a gloom,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 2:1. </i> [and] “How dim can it be [that the golden glow] has paled.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 4:1. </i> He added to it, “I am the man...”,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 3:1. </i> which contains three sets of alphabetical acrostics, as it is stated, “and many more words were added similar to those [of the original scroll],”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 36:32. </i> three corresponding to three.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He also added Chapter 5. See Eichah Rabbah, Pesichta 28. </i> 
<b>In isolation.</b> Devoid of her inhabitants.
<b>Teeming with people.</b> The <i>yud</i> of רַבָּתִי is superfluous;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Palgei Mayim explains that the <i>yud</i> is not superfluous because the prophet is speaking in [first person singular] God’s Name, saying, “How can it be that the city that ‘I’ made great and that ‘I’ made important, etc.” </i> [it means the same] as, רַבָּתִי עָם, that her people were many.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘the city whose people were so wise’ yet they were unable to prevent its destruction. (Eichah Rabbah); or, ‘the city with great people.’ (Ibn Ezra) </i> There are many Aggadic midrashim, but I have come to explain the Scripture according to its literal meaning. 
<b>Has become like a widow.</b> But not really a widow; rather, like a woman whose husband went abroad and he intends to return to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 104a. </i> 

Verse 2

<b>She weeps bitterly.</b> Weeping twice over the two destructions [of the Beis Hamikdosh].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi is explaining the reason for the double verb בכו תבכה. Alternatively, Yerusholayim weeps, and God, as it were, also weeps. (Yalkut Me’am Lo’ez) </i> 
<b>In the night.</b> For the Beis Hamikdosh was burned at night, as the master said, “at the time of evening they set it on fire.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Ta’anis 29a. </i> Another explanation of “in the night,” [is that] the night of the weeping of the spies on the ninth of Av caused it to happen to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. </i> Another explanation of “in the night,” is that whoever weeps at night, the one who hears his voice weeps along with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Sanhedrin 104b. </i> 
<b>Her tear on her cheek.</b> Because she cries constantly.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, her pain and suffering were so intense that she did not bother to wipe away her tears. (Yalkut Me’am Lo’ez) </i> 
<b>All of her friends.</b> Her lovers.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the prophets who predicted only her doom. (Palgei Mayim) Alternatively, her former allies who abandoned her in her time of crisis. </i> 

Verse 3

<b>Yehudah was exiled.</b> From her land.
<b>Because of torment.</b> Because of her affliction.
<b>And excessive toil.</b> With which the people of Kasdim burdened her.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Yehudah was exiled because of her idol worship [עבודה זרה]. (Rishon Letzion) </i> 
<b>[Even] when she dwelt among the nations.</b> And in the place where she was exiled and settled, she found no respite.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Because in the land where they were exiled, they were unable to partake of their food or their wine. (Lechem Dimah) Alternatively, although exile and torment serve as atonement for sin, the atonement was not complete and therefore there was no respite. </i> 
<b>Between the barriers.</b> It is elevated on either side and there is no place to flee.
<b>The barriers.</b> The boundaries of fields and vineyards.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">From where there is no way to escape. (Palgei Mayim) </i> The Midrash Aggadah [explains that it refers to the boundaries of time], i.e., between the seventeenth of Tammuz and the ninth of Av. 

Verse 4

<b>Festival visitors.</b> People who went up [to Yerusholayim] for the festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, מועד refers to the Beis Hamikdosh, i.e., ‘for lack of Beis Hamikdosh visitors.’ </i> 
<b>Grieve.</b> An expression of grief,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Because the maidens were no longer able to go out and rejoice on the two most joyous days of the year, on the fifteenth of Menachem Av and on Yom Kippur. See Maseches Ta’anis, Mishnah 4:8. </i> and there is no radical [=שֹׁרֶשׁ but the ‘gimel’ alone. 

Verse 5

<b>Are at ease.</b> Sit peacefully.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘her enemies hunted her down.’ (Yein Horekach); or ‘her enemies made peace with each other.’ Although they were fighting among themselves, they made peace and united against the Bnei Yisroel. See Rashi in Bamidbar 22:3 regarding Midyan and Mo’av. (Lechem Dimah) </i> 
<b>Has brought her grief.</b> Caused her to moan; it is an expression of sighing יָגוֹן.

Verse 6

<b>Like harts who could find no pasture.</b> Like harts who did not find pasture and have no strength to flee,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, her nobles acted like harts who abandon their young when there is no pasture. Similarly, Bnei Yisroel’s leaders did not chastise their brethren, but rather abandoned them. (Palgei Mayim) </i> for their strength has been weakened by hunger. 
<b>Before the pursuer.</b> Every רֹדֵף in Scripture is defective,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is spelled without a ‘<i>vav</i>’. </i> but this one רוֹדֵף is full,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is spelled with a <i>vav</i>. </i> for they were totally pursued. Therefore the liturgic author composed, “I have been totally pursued, but the year of my redemption has not come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Selichos for the second day of Aseres Yemei Teshuvah. </i> [Also,] “and the year of my redemption has come,”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 63:4. </i> is spelled defectively גְּאֻלַי.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Without a <i>vav</i>. In our editions it is spelled full [גאולי]. However, the prophecy in Yeshayahuu 59:20 states, “A redeemer [גואל—spelled full] will come to Tzion,” to indicate a “total redemption.” (Eichah Rabbah 1:33) </i> 

Verse 7

<b>Yerusholayim remembered.</b> In her exile.
<b>The days of her poverty.</b> The days of her destruction, which brought her to poverty. 
<b>And lamenting.</b> This וּמְרוּדֶיהָ is an expression of pain<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘and her rebellion [מרד] against God.’ </i> as in, “and I will wail וְיָרַדְתִּי upon the mountains,”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 11:37. </i> [and as in,] “I lament אָרִיד as I speak and I moan.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 55:3. </i> 
<b>All her treasures.</b> And [Yerusholayim] remembered all the good of her precious things<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">מחמדיה in this verse has a different meaning than in Verse 10 below, where it means ‘Torah scrolls.’ (Sifsei Chachomim) </i> that were from days of old.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The beginning of the verse speaks of ‘her poverty’, therefore Rashi explains that ‘her treasures’ relates back to the ‘days of old.’ (Sifsei Chachomim) </i> 
<b>Laughing derisively when she was curbed.</b> They rejoiced over the cessation of her celebrating at her festivals, New Moons, and Sabbaths. But the Midrash Aggadah interprets it as a different expression, that they rested in exile on the Sabbath and festivals, and observed the seventh [i.e., Sabbatical] year. The gentiles ridiculed them and said, “Fools! In your land you did not observe [Sabbath and festivals,] and now in exile you keep it? In your land you did not observe [the Sabbatical year,] and now in exile you keep it?” 

Verse 8

<b>A wanderer.</b> One who is in exile; an expression of moving and wandering,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereishis 4:12. Also, see Rashi in verse 17 below. </i> <i>esmovement</i> in O.F. 
<b>Her degradation.</b> [Literally; her nakedness] Her shame.
<b>Sorrowful.</b> [Here נֶאֶנְחָה is] an expression in the passive past tense, <i>sospira</i> in O.F. [However, in] “They have heard how I groan,”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Below, verse 21. </i> it is a noun, <i>sospirose</i> in O.F. 

Verse 9

<b>Her defilement is at her hem.</b> This is an expression of disgrace. Her menstrual blood is visible in the hems of her garments, i.e., her sins are conspicuous; she committed them flagrantly.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, she committed her sins inconspicuously, hidden behind her hem. (Alshich) </i> 
<b>She was not mindful of her end.</b> When they would sin, they were not mindful of what their end would be. Therefore, she fell astonishingly. Her descent was astonishing, bringing about much bewilderment, for all were amazed that this happened to her, something that did not happen to any other city. 

Verse 10

<b>The oppressor extended his hand.</b> Ammon and Mo’av.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Nevuchadnetzar. (Targum) </i> 
<b>Over all her treasures.</b> The Torah scrolls, which are spoken of as, “they are more desirable than gold.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 19:11. </i> All [the other nations] turned to plunder silver and gold, but they [i.e. Ammon and Mo’av] turned upon the Torah scrolls in order to burn them, because it is written in them, “an Ammonite [or a Mo’avite] shall not enter, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 23:4. </i> Concerning whom You commanded, 
<b>“Let them not enter your community.</b>” These are referring to Ammon and Mo’av.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>May this not happen to you.</b> Such a calamity should not happen to all those who transgress the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">עוברי דרך is translated thus, ‘those who transgress [עוברי] the way [דרך] of the Torah.’ </i> The Sages said, that from here it is derived that to [publicly] complain about one’s troubles has a basis in Scripture, [for Scripture states here,] “see what He did to me” [and] “Notice, see, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Sanhedrin 104b. </i> 
<b>That has been visited upon me.</b> That was done to me.
<b>When Adonoy brought grief.</b> Upon me on the day He vented His wrath. This הוֹגָה too is an expression of grief.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, הגה is an expression of speech; the phrase meaning, ‘that God had spoken [through His prophets].’ </i> 

Verse 13

<b>Crushing it.</b> It [the fire] crushed it and broke it through punishment and suffering. Therefore, the ‘<i>nun</i>’ is punctuated with a ‘<i>dagesh</i>’, so that it is interpreted in the feminine singular, as in יַעֲשֶׂנָּה [=he will do it], יְכַרְסְמֶנָּה [=he will gnaw at it], יִרְעֶנָּה [=will graze upon it]; for עֶצֶם [=bone] is in the feminine gender, as [Scripture] states, “the dry bones [=הָעֲצָמוֹת הַיְבֵשׁוֹת.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 37:4. </i> It broke each one. Another explanation, וַיִּרְדֶּנָּה as in, “and he separated it into his hands.”<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 14:9. </i> He emptied the marrow, [i.e.,] he scraped and separated the marrow from within it.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘and sent it [i.e., fire] down.’ </i> 

Verse 14

<b>The yoke of my iniquities is recorded in His hand.</b> This word נִשְׂקַד has no likeness in Scripture, and in the Aramaic language of the Pesikta, they call a goad מַסְקָדָא, an ox goad. And I say that נִשְׂקַד is <i>pointured</i> in O.F., [meaning,] my transgressions were dotted, spotted, and marked in the hand of the Holy One, Blessed Is He, for a remembrance; their number and recompense have not been forgotten. 
<b>They have become interwoven.</b> They became many braids, and came up to my neck,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">צואר [neck] is symbolic of the Beis Hamikdosh; see Rashi in Bereishis 45:14. </i> [as in] the language of the Mishnah, “We may (not) interlace the ropes of the bedsteads.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Mo’ed Katan, Mishnah 1:8. </i> 

Verse 15

<b>Trampled.</b> He trampled and trod, an expression of, “pave, pave סֹלּוּ the road.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahuu 62:10. </i> 
<b>He has proclaimed a gathering against me.</b> A gathering of troops to come against me.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘He has proclaimed to break [מועד] me.’ (Yein Horekach) </i> And our Rabbis expounded what they expounded. Tammuz of that year was a full month [=30 days], of the second year from their Exodus from Egypt. Therefore, the return of the spies occurred on the night of the ninth of Av, upon which their weeping was established for generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Ta’anis 29a. According to this explanation, מועד means ‘a set time.’ </i> 
<b>[As with] a wine press, [God] has trodden.</b> An expression of killing, as in, “I alone have trodden a winepress,”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahuu 63:3. </i> as one treads upon grapes to extract their wine, so did He trample the women to extract their blood. 

Verse 16

<b>My eyes.</b> I.e., my eye constantly sheds tears; the double expression indicates without interruption.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the double expression indicates the shedding of tears from both eyes. (Targum) </i> 

Verse 17

<b>Tzion spread her arms.</b> As in, “and he will stretch out his hand in its midst,”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahuu 25:11. </i> like a person who moves his hands back and forth [showing] his pain with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘Tzion spread her arms in prayer, but to no avail.’ (Lechem Dimah) </i> Another explanation: פֵּרְשָׂה צִיּוֹן is an expression of breaking, as in, “no one breaks פּוֹרֵשׂ bread for them,”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Eichah 4:4. </i> [and as in,] “they will not break [bread] for them in their bereavement to comfort them for the dead.”<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 16:7. </i> So did Menachem classify it. And in the language of the Mishnah, “the broken piece of bread פְּרוּסָה is intact.”<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 37a. </i> It means [that Tzion was] like a person in pain who clasps his hands and breaks them [from agony]. I found an addendum. Adonoy has commanded concerning Yaakov, 
<b>that his oppressors surround him.</b> He commanded concerning Yaakov that his adversaries would surround him. Even when they were exiled to Bavel and Assyria, Sancheirev exiled their enemies, Ammon and Mo’av, and settled them beside them, and they taunted them,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even in exile they are surrounded by their enemies. </i> as is stated in Maseches Kiddushin,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">72a. </i> that Homanya was in Bavel, entirely [occupied] by Ammonites. 
<b>Despicable.</b> As an outcast, a disgrace.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Although Rashi above in verse 8 translated לנידה as a wanderer, here it is spelled without a <i>yud</i> [לנדה], meaning derision. (Sifsei Chachomim) </i> 

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>I cried out to those who appeared to love me.</b> To those who pretend to be [my] lovers.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the neighboring countries with the hope of forming an alliance. </i> 
<b>But they deceived me.</b> E.g., the children of Yishmael, who came out toward the exiles when the[ir] captors were leading them on the road nearby, and pretended that they were compassionate toward them. They brought for them various kinds of salty foods and inflated skin flasks. They thought that they [contained] wine, so they ate and became thirsty and wished to drink; but when they untied the flasks with their teeth, the air entered their intestines and they died. This is what Scripture says, “in the forest in Arabia shall you lodge, etc. Bring water for the thirsty, the inhabitants of the land of Tema greeted the wanderer with their bread.”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahuu 21:13-14. </i> 
<b>To sustain their souls.</b> In order that they should revive their souls.

Verse 20

<b>Shriveled.</b> They became shriveled, and there is [an expression] like this in the language of the Mishnah, “It fell into the fire and its intestines were scorched וְנֶחְמְרוּ.”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Chulin 3:3. </i> 
<b>Within, it is like death.</b> Within the house was fear of demons, destructive beings, and angels of death; and from without, the enemy’s sword was bereaving them. 

Verse 21

<b>For it is Your doing.</b> You caused them to hate me when You separated me from [partaking of] their food and drink and from intermarrying with them. If I had intermarried with them, they would have had compassion upon me and upon their daughters’ children. 
<b>Bring the day that You proclaimed.</b> If only you had brought upon them the appointed day that You proclaimed upon me.
<b>And let them resemble me.</b> In distress.

Verse 22

<b>Let all their evil come before You.</b> May all their iniquities be remembered and counted before You.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">And judge them accordingly. </i> 
<b>And do to them.</b> And do to them, as in, “[even a child] can be recognized by his deeds בְּמַעֲלָלָיו”;<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei 20:11. </i> and [as in,] “according to the fruits of his deeds מַעֲלָלָיו.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 32:19. </i> 

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>How can it be that…cast a gloom.</b> Bring darkness,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘has raised up to the clouds.’ (Ibn Ezra) </i> as Scripture states, “the heavens had become darkened with clouds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 18:45. </i> 
<b>From heaven to earth.</b> After He lifted them up to heaven, He cast them to earth all at once, and not gradually;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise Scripture should have stated לארץ, instead of ארץ, the latter expression indicates that it was done in one instant. (Sifsei Chachomim) </i> from a lofty roof to a deep pit. 
<b>His footstool.</b> His footstool, referring to the Beis Hamikdosh.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Targum in Tehilim 99:5. </i> 

Verse 2

<b>[Every] residence of Yaakov.</b> The houses of Yaakov,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the exile of the ten tribes; and ‘the fortifications of the province of Yehudah’ refers to the exile of the Dovidic dynasty, and thereby ‘He desecrated the kingdom, etc.’ </i> an expression of a dwelling place.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From the root נוה; referring to the 480 learning institutions in Yerusholayim. (Eichah Rabbah 2:4) </i> 
<b>Razing them to the ground.</b> He lowered them to the ground.
<b>He has desecrated the kingdom and its princes.</b> These are the Israelites, who were called, “a kingdom of <i>kohanim</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 19:6. </i> 
<b>And its princes.</b> Midrash Aggadah [states] that these are the heavenly princes<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It cannot mean ordinary princes because they are included in the previously stated ‘the kingdom.’ (Sifsei Chachomim) </i> [whose appointments] He changed. The one appointed over fire He appointed over water, and He changed all the appointees because there were among the wicked of Yisroel those who knew the Ineffable Name of God, and they relied that they could invoke the heavenly princes to save them from fire, water, and sword. But now, when he would invoke the prince of fire by his name, he would reply, “This dominion is not within my power,” and so all of them. 

Verse 3

<b>He withheld His right hand.</b> He withdrew Himself as though withdrawing His right hand from waging war for his children.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">His right hand is symbolic of strength and war. See Shemos 15:6. </i> 

Verse 4

<b>He arched His bow.</b> Because this is the manner of archers who are strong, to place their foot upon them [bows] when he bends them; therefore it is written as an expression of treading [=דְּרִיכָה.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">At first He merely arched his bow to scare them so that they repent. </i> 
<b>He poured his fury like fire.</b> The arrangement of the words is as follows: He poured His fury, which is like fire, for we do not find the “pouring” of fire except in conjunction with fury as it is written, “Pour Your fury upon the nations.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 79:6. </i> 

Verse 5

<b>He magnified in the community of Yehudah.</b> He increased in the congregation of Yehudah.
<b>Suffering and lamentation.</b> Pain and wailing.
<b>He magnified.</b> The <i>yud</i> is vowelized with a small <i>patach</i> [=<i>segol</i>], which is an expression of increasing others, [as in,] “And the people increased וַיִּרֶב and were very mighty,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 1:20. See Rashi there on וייטב. </i> is vowelized [under the <i>yud</i>] with a <i>chirik</i>, which is an expression meaning that he himself increased. Similarly, every word whose radical ends with a <i>hei</i>, e.g., to turn פָּנָה, to go astray זָנָה, to weep בָּכָה, are vowelized in that manner when the <i>hei</i> is missing, when it speaks of itself it is vowelized with a <i>chirik</i>, e.g., “And Pharaoh turned.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 17:23. </i> But when it speaks of others it is vowelized with a small <i>patach</i> [=<i>segol</i>], e.g., “and he turned [the foxes] tail to tail,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 15:4. </i> [and] “and Yehudah went into exile from his land,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">II Melochim 25:21. Here, ויגל is vowelized with a <i>chirik</i>. </i> [and] “and the king of Bavel exiled Yisroel into Assyria.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 18:11. </i> 

Verse 6

<b>He cut down.</b> An expression of cutting, and similarly, “He will cast off like a vine,”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 15:33. </i> [and] “your steps were cut off.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 13:22. </i> 
<b>Like a garden.</b> As they cut off the vegetables of a garden.
<b>His dwelling place.</b> His abode.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Kodesh Hakodoshim. (Palgei Mayim) </i> It is written שִׁכּוֹ [to indicate] that He lightened<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As in Bereishis 8:1, ‘and the waters subsided’ [וישכו]. </i> His anger against His children with the destruction of His House. [So it is expounded] in the Midrash of Lamentations.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Eichah Rabbah 2:10. </i> 
<b>He destroyed His place of Communion.</b> The Holy of Holies,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the Beis Hamikdosh. (Palgei Mayim) </i> where He would meet with His children, as it is stated, “I will set My meeting you there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 25:22. See footnote for 1:4 above. </i> 
<b>The king and the <i>kohein</i>.</b> King Tzidkiyahu<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See II Melochim 25:7. </i> and Serayahu the <i>Kohein Gadol</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See II Melochim 25:18-21. Rashi explains that the king and the <i>kohein</i> must be two individuals rather than a king who is a <i>kohein</i>, because the kings who ruled during the period of the first Beis Hamikdosh were descendants of the non-<i>kohein</i> Dovidic dynasty. (Sifsei Chachomim) </i> 

Verse 7

<b>[He] nullified.</b> He rejected,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘he burnt.’ </i> and similarly, “You rejected נֵאַרְתָּה the covenant of Your servant.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 89:40. </i> 
<b>Like that of a festival day.</b> For they were making merry and singing with a loud voice in its midst. So did the enemies let out a cry of joy when it was destroyed.

Verse 8

<b>Adonoy determined to destroy.</b> It had been many days since this entered His mind, as it is stated, “For it has aroused My anger and My fury— this city—[from the day that they built it until this day], to remove it from My Presence.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 32:31. </i> 
<b>He set the course.</b> Of judgement, to be punished for our sins. 
<b>From destroying.</b> From destroying.

<b>I am the man who has seen torment.</b> Yirmiyahu lamented, saying, “I am the man who has seen torment,” [i.e.,] who has seen torment more than all the prophets who prophesied concerning the destruction of the Beis Hamikdosh, for the Beis Hamikdosh was not destroyed in their days, but it was [destroyed] in my days .

Verse 19

<b>And my lament.</b> <i>Conpleint</i> in O.F., [wailing]. 

Verse 20

<b>When remembering.</b> My soul [remembers] my affliction and my misery and is bowed down within me. This is the simple meaning according to the context of the verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., תזכור is in the ‘third person feminine,’ and refers to his soul. </i> But, the Midrash Aggadah explains זָכוֹר תִּזְכּוֹר, as, “I know that in the end You will remember what was done to me,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., תזכור is in the ‘second person masculine,’ and refers to God. In the Hebrew language, the ‘second person masculine’ and the ‘third person feminine’ are identical.

Verse 21

<b>Still I take this to heart.</b> After my heart told me that my hope from God was gone, I will reply this to my heart, and I will continue to hope. What is it that I will reply to my heart?

Verse 24

<b>‘Adonoy is my portion,’ my soul declares.</b> God is my portion; therefore it is proper that I should hope in Him. 

Verse 25



Verse 26

Verse 29



Verse 30



Verse 31

<b>For God does not forsake forever.</b> It is therefore good to wait.

Verse 32

<b>Rather should he [man] cause grief.</b> If man brings grief upon himself because of his sin[s], afterwards, He will yet have compassion in accordance with His immense grace.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘He first afflicts, then pities according to His abundant kindness.’ (Targum) </i> 
<b>Cause grief ... Cause grief.</b> [Both words] are expressions of grief.

Verse 34

<b>By crushing underfoot.</b> This refers back to, “For He does not torment willfully by crushing underfoot, etc. nor through the miscarriage of one’s justice, etc. nor by aggrieving a man in his dispute.” All these, God did not condone. He did not approve of them, and it did not enter His thought to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘by crushing underfoot’ refers to Nevuchadnetzar.

Verse 37

<b>Whosoever issued a declaration that took effect, etc.</b> 

Verse 38

<b>From the Almighty, etc.</b> And if you attempt to say that this evil did not come to me from His hand, that it is coincidence that has befallen me; this is not so. For both bad occurrences and good occurrences, who has commanded and they came to pass, unless God ordained? And He commands neither bad nor good [to come]. But what should a living man bemoan? “A man for his sins.” Every man should bemoan his sins, because they are what bring the evil upon him. (“They did not emanate from the Almighty,” Rabbi Yochonon said, “From the day that the Holy One, Blessed Is He, said, ‘See, I have placed before you today the life and the good, etc.,’<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 30:15. </i> neither evil nor good has come from His command.” Rather the evil comes by itself to the one who commits evil, and the good to the one who does good.) Therefore, what should one bemoan? Why should a man be angry, if not about his sins?

<b>My eye has made me ugly, sorrowing over my soul, more than all the inhabitants of my city.</b> Yirmiyahu was from a family of <i>kohanim</i>, and he said, “My eye, with its tears, sullied my face over my soul more than all the inhabitants of my city.”

Verse 54

<b>The waters rose, etc.</b> When a person is in water up to his waist, there still is hope, but if the water rises over his head, he then says, “My hope is gone,” but I do not do this, rather “I called out, etc.”

Whoever saw them would say, “Look, the complexion of these is like the appearance of gold,” and similarly, “it cannot be praised תְסֻלֶּה with the gold jewelry of Ophir,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 28:16. </i> [and as in,] “with jewelry of fine gold, it cannot be praised תְסֻלֶּה”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 28:19. </i> [and as in,] “praise סֹלּוּ Him Who rides the heavens.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 68:5. </i> These are expressions of praise and value. 
<b>Like flasks of clay.</b> Earthen pitchers in which they pour wine, e.g., wine flasks, [as in,] “And they will smash their jars וְנִבְלֵיהֶם.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 48:12. The scraps of broken metal utensils have some value, but the shards of broken earthenware have no value whatsoever. (Ramak) </i> 

Verse 3

<b>Even the serpent.</b> Even though it is cruel, <b>it bares its breast.</b> When it sees its offspring coming from afar, hungry, it uncovers its breasts from their sheath, for it has a cover over its breasts, and it takes them out so that its offspring should not see them covered up and turn away. Then they suckle their young. 
<b>Yet the daughters of my people have become brutal.</b> They see their children crying for bread, and yet no one breaks [bread] for them; for their own lives come before their children’s lives because of the hunger.

<b>Untouched by [human] hands.</b> I.e., the hands of the enemy;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘who had no prophets’ to lead them back to teshuvah; i.e., S’dom, unlike ‘my people,’ had no prophets to chastise them, therefore Bnei Yisroel’s ‘transgressions surpassed, etc.’ (Targum) </i> but it was overthrown through angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to S’dom. </i> There are also Aggadic Midrashim, but they do not fit the sequence of the verses. 

Verse 7

<b>Her Nazirites were more pristine.</b> Her princes, like נֵזֶר and כֶּתֶר [=a crown]. But I say [it means] actual Nazirites, who had long hair and were very handsome, and the antecedent is “of my people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Above Verse 6. </i>

<b>Shrivelled.</b> Shriveled and attached; and there is no similar [word in Scripture].

Verse 9

<b>For they dripped with burst bellies, etc.</b> The corpses [of those who died] because of hunger were swollen from the aroma of the fruits of the field. The enemies would roast meat on the grass outside the wall, and the aroma would go into those swollen from hunger, and their stomachs would split, and their feces would ooze. This is an uglier death than those slain by the sword. 
<b>With burst bellies.</b> Being split; either by the swelling of hunger or by the stabbing of the sword is called piercing [=דְּקִירָה.
<b>From [eating] the produce of the fields.</b> Because of the roots and grass that they gathered and ate, their feces increased and they were loathsome. 

Verse 10

<b>Their food.</b> For food, as in, “and he did not eat בָרָה food with them,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 12:17. </i> [and as in] “to serve Dovid a meal לְהַבְרוֹת.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 3:35. </i>

Verse 15

<b>Get away.</b> From us, you unclean ones, who are sullied with blood.

Verse 16

<b>In Adonoy’s glaring anger He dispersed them.</b> The angry face of the Holy One, Blessed Is He, divided and separated them among the nations, because they did not respect the presence of the <i>kohanim</i> when they were in their tranquility. 

Verse 17

<b>We persisted in longingly eyeing illusive reinforcements.</b> When the evil befell us, our eyes were still looking forward to Pharaoh’s army, concerning whom it is stated, “And the Egyptians, they help in vain and to no purpose,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 30:7. </i> for they would promise us aid but they would not come, as it is stated concerning them, “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help [you], is returning to its land, to Egypt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 37:7. </i> We find in Midrash Kinos that they were coming in ships.

Verse 18

<b>They lurked behind our steps.</b> Our enemies stalked our footsteps [and prevented us] from walking in our streets, as in, “but for one who had not lain in ambush צָדָה”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 21:13. </i> [and as in,] “but you are stalking צָדָה my soul.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 34:12. </i>

Verse 21

<b>Rejoice in gladness city of Edom.</b> Yirmiyahu prophesied about the destruction of the second Beis Hamikdosh which the Romans would destroy.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, it refers to Edom who rejoiced at the downfall of Yerusholayim and rejoiced at the destruction of the first Beis Hamikdosh, as it says “Remember, Adonoy, for the offspring of Edom...who say ‘Destroy!

<b>Rejoice in gladness.</b> For the time being, but ultimately, the cup of retribution will pass also over you, and you will become drunk from it.
