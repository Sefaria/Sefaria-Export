Rashi on Nehemiah



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>The words of Nehemiah, etc.</b> Nehemiah wrote this book from here on.
<b>the twentieth year</b> This refers to the twentieth year of King Darius, who is identical with Artaxerxes. In Tractate Rosh Hashanah (3a, b), we find that the phrase “the twentieth year” is mentioned twice using similar wording [to teach us that it is speaking of the identical year]. It states below (2:1), “And it came to pass in the month of Nissan of the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, etc.” The years were calculated from the month of Tishrei. It says here, “And it was in the month of Kislev of the twentieth year, etc.” This refers to the Kislev coming after Tishrei. Further down it says (2:1), “And it was in the month of Nissan of the twentieth year, etc.” This refers to the Nissan of the same year. And I cannot explain that they calculated their years from the month of Nissan and that the incident mentioned below: “And it was in the month of Nissan, etc.” occurred before this incident: “And it was in the month of Kislev, etc.” It is true that events [in the Torah] are not necessarily recorded in chronological order. Nevertheless, the chapters indicate that the second chapter took place only because of the events of the first chapter.

Verse 2

<b>one of my brethren</b> one of my companions.
<b>and I asked them about the Jews</b> I asked them about the Jews who had escaped the Babylonian captivity and remained in Jerusalem.
<b>who had escaped</b> because they were saved from the Babylonian exile.
<b>and about Jerusalem</b> And I asked them about the city.

Verse 3

<b>And they said to me</b> They answered my first question first and my latter question last; first, concerning the Jews and afterwards, concerning the wall and the gates.
<b>who remained</b> Those Jews who remained in the province of Jerusalem are in great trouble and reproach because the gentiles plunder and pillage them.
<b>and the wall of Jerusalem is breached</b> And the wall of the city is breached, and the gates are burned with fire as they were before, for Israel had not built the wall of the city or its gates, only the Temple.
<b>were burned</b> Heb. נִצְתוּ, like נֻצְתוּ.

Verse 4

<b>for days</b> Heb. יָמִים, many days.

Verse 5

<b>I beseech You</b> Heb. אָנָא, an expression of request and supplication.

Verse 6

<b>attentive</b> Heb. קַשֶּׁבֶת, like קוֹשֶּׁבֶת, listening, for just as one says from אוֹהֵב, אָהַב, so does one say from קָשַּׁב, קוֹשֵּׁב and קוֹשֶּׁבֶת.

Verse 7

<b>We have dealt corruptly</b> Heb. חֲבֹל, a noun, an expression of corruption, since the “heth” is vowelized with a “hataf pattah,” and I cannot interpret it as a verb form, because in that case, it would have to be vowelized with a large “kamatz.”
<b>we have dealt corruptly</b> Heb. חָבַלְנוּ, an expression of corruption, as in Daniel (6:23): “I have done no harm.”

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>if your exile is</b> like the matter that is stated (Deut. 30:4): “If your exile is at the end of the heavens, etc.”

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>I beseech You, O Lord, may Your ear now be attentive</b> At the beginning of his prayer he used this expression, and so after his prayer.
<b>Your servant</b> This is what he prayed for himself.
<b>before this man</b> before the king.
<b>butler</b> Heb. מַשְּׁקֶה, like (Gen. 40:1): “...the butler of (מַשְּׁקֶה) the king of Egypt.” This is what I explained above (Ezra 2:63) according to the words of our Sages, that Hattirshatha is Nehemiah.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>of...Artaxerxes</b> That was Darius, and because of his kingship he was called this.
<b>wine before him</b> They brought wine before the king in the court.
<b>and I carried the wine</b> And I carried the cup of wine and gave it to the king, and so is the custom, that the one who brings wine into the king’s court does not carry it and give it to the king, but the chief butler receives it from the hand of the one who brings it, and carries it and gives it to the king.
<b>And I had never been sad in his presence</b> And I was not accustomed to being sad in his presence, to have a sad face, but to be happy and cheerful, but now I was sad with a sad face.

Verse 2

<b>You are not ill</b> Is it not so that you are not ill?
<b>This is nothing</b> This incident is only wickedness of heart, that you have in your heart to put me to death by poisoning this cup.
<b>And I became very frightened</b> And I became very frightened about this, lest the king accuse me falsely.

Verse 3

<b>Why should my countenance not be sad</b> [as translated,] why should my countenance not be sad.
<b>when the city</b> Jerusalem, which is the place of the graves of my forefathers, is laid waste.

Verse 4

<b>For what do you make request</b> What do you request of me and I shall do it for you.
<b>And I prayed</b> And I said before the king in my prayer, “May it be Your will, O God of the heavens, that You fulfill my petition and my request.”

Verse 5

<b>that you send me</b> that you grant me permission to ascend to Jerusalem and build it.

Verse 6

<b>And the king said to me</b> At the time the king spoke to me, his wife, the queen, was sitting beside him.
<b>and the queen</b> Heb. וְהַשֵּׁגָל, his wife the queen, as it is stated (Dan. 5:2): “...his queen (שֵּׁגְלָתֵהּ) and his concubine,” for it is customary for Scripture to write “the queen,” next to “the concubine”; his wives and his concubines, like (Song 6:9): “מְלָכוֹת וּפִּילַגְשִּׁים, queens and concubines. “
<b>How long will your trip take</b> When is it your intention to return?
<b>and when will you return?</b> When is it your intention to return?
<b>and he sent me</b> He gave me permission to go.
<b>and I gave him a time</b> I gave him a time of return.

Verse 7

<b>may letters be given to me</b> [Let] your scribes [give me letters] by your sanction and your knowledge, sealed with your signet to the governors of the land beyond the river, on the side of the land of Israel.
<b>that they escort me through</b> and escort me in peace.
<b>until I come</b> to Jerusalem, which is in the province of Judea.

Verse 8

<b>And a letter to Asaph</b> and that you send a letter to Asaph.
<b>the guardian of the king’s orchard</b> He was appointed over the king’s forests.
<b>to make beams</b> This is the intensive conjugation: to make ceilings and beams for the gates of the castles of the Temple Mount, for they had built the Temple as it should be built, but the gates of the walls of the Temple Mount and the wall for the court surrounding the Temple had not yet been built.
<b>and for the wall of the city</b> and to make beams for the wall of the city.
<b>and for the house to which I shall go</b> and to make a house in which I shall dwell for my needs.
<b>and the king gave me</b> all I asked him for.
<b>according to the good hand</b> according to the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, which was good upon me, to cause me to succeed.

Verse 9

<b>and I gave them the king’s letters</b> in order that they escort me in peace.
<b>officers of the army and horsemen</b> the king sent with me [officers] in my honor, in order that I go in peace.

Verse 10

<b>Now Sanballat etc., heard</b> When they heard that I had come to request good for Israel and to build the walls of Jerusalem it displeased them greatly, for they were the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin.

Verse 11

<b>and I was there for three days</b> I was in Jerusalem for three days, and at the end of three days, I and a few men with me arose at night, and I did not tell any person what the Holy One, blessed be He, had put into my heart.

Verse 12

<b>and there were no animals with me</b> The few men who were with me went by foot and I alone rode on an animal. They did not ride their horses because they wanted to leave the city in secret, without anyone knowing. They went to break and cast down the walls of the city at night and to increase their breaches in order that on the morrow, the people of the city would be eager and agree unanimously with Nehemiah to build the walls of the city. So it appears from the text.

Verse 13

<b>And I went out through the Gate of the Valley</b> I went out through that gate at night with the men who were with me toward En Hattannin and the Dung Gate in the wall of the city; and I broke the wall, and the wall was easily cast down and broken because it had been burned with fire.
<b>which were breached</b> which are those places that were breached, and they breached them more.

Verse 14

<b>And I passed to the Fountain Gate</b> And I wished to pass to those places in the wall of the city and in those breaches, and there was no place in those breaches for riders on animals to pass through because they were so small.

Verse 15

<b>And I ascended</b> And I was ascending from one side at night, and I was breaking the wall with the men who were with me.
<b>and I returned and came</b> And when I returned, I came by way of the Gate of the Valley.

Verse 16

<b>And the prefects</b> who were in the city did not know where I had gone to and what I had done.
<b>yet</b> Heb. עַד כֵּן, until now.

Verse 17

<b>And I said to them</b> On the morrow I said to them.
<b>and we shall no longer be a reproach</b> that our adversaries should not plunder and pillage us.

Verse 18

<b>the hand of my God</b> who gave me favor and success before the king.
<b>for good</b> They intended everything for good—to build the wall of the city and its towers.

Verse 19

<b>and they mocked</b> When our adversaries heard the news of the building of the walls of the city, they mocked us.
<b>are...against the king</b> Are you rebelling against the king by building the wall of the city in order to rebel against him?

Verse 20

<b>but you have no share</b> What do you have in the building of the wall of this city, for you have no share in it.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>the Sheep Gate</b> Such was the name of the gate.
<b>they hallowed it</b> that gate with the sanctity of the city.
<b>its doors</b> i.e., of the gate.
<b>and until the Tower of the Hundred</b> Such was the name of the tower.

Verse 2

<b>And next to it</b> Next to it, near the Sheep’s Gate, each builder built.
<b>the men of Jericho built</b> Such was their custom, these would build here [their section] of the wall of the city until [the part] they were responsible for was completed, and then others would build next to the first construction. Such was their custom, one after another, until the entire wall was built.
<b>And next</b> As in (Num. 2:20) “Next to him, the tribe of Manasseh”, near him, and such is its explanation, next to the construction, and Scripture was not particular in its choice of words. Sometimes it says ודי לע, and sometimes it says וילו. “And next to them he repaired.”

Verse 3

<b>the Fish Gate</b> Such was the name of the gate.
<b>they laid its beams</b> They placed the beams and ceilings on the gate.
<b>they laid its beams</b> Heb. קֵֵֵֵרוּהוּ the intensive conjugation, like “...behold he laid the beams (קֵרָה),” [which appears nowhere in Scripture;] similar to (Ps. 104:3): “Who roofs (הַמְקָרֶה) His upper chambers with water.” The “kuf” of קֵרוּהוּ is not customarily vowelized with a “hirik” in this context because of the “resh” following it, like (ibid. 10:3): “blessed (בֵּרֵךְ)”; (Prov. 17: 5): “blasphemed (חֵרֵף)”; (Gen. 17:16): “I shall bless her (וּבֵרַכְתִּיהָ)”;(Ezek. 29:12): “and I shall scatter them (וּזְרֵתִים) in the lands.”
<b>its locks</b> מַנְעוּלָיו, ses verrous in French, its bolts (locks).

Verse 4

<b>repaired</b> Heb. הֶחְֱזִיק, [lit. strengthened,] to build the building.

Verse 5

<b>the Tekoites</b> They were called this because of their place, which was Tekoa.
<b>but their mighty men</b> the wealthy men of Tekoa.
<b>did not bring their neck</b> They did not assist in the service of the Holy One, blessed be He, to build the wall of the city.

Verse 6

<b>And...the gate of the old [city]</b> Heb. הַיְשָּׁנָה, the Gate Yeshana, such was its name.

Verse 7

<b>a throne for the governor of the land beyond the river</b> The [people of] the land beyond the river built a throne for the governor of the land beyond the river to sit upon.

Verse 8

<b>goldsmiths</b> That family was called by their craft.
<b>and they filled Jerusalem</b> Heb. וַיַעַזְבוּ יְרוּשָּׁלַיִם They filled it with earth up to the wide wall in order to strengthen it.

Verse 9

<b>the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem</b> He was the prince over half the people in Jerusalem. פֶּלֶךְ is an expression of a duchy or a kingdom.

Verse 10

<b>and opposite his house</b> his lot fell to build, for his house was near that place of the wall of the city.

Verse 11

<b>a second measure</b> Just like the measurement which his friend built before [him], so he also built like [his friend.] <b>a second measure</b> in the building of the wall. The expression of measure is inappropriate for the building of the gates because they have [a measure] only in the building of a part of the wall, for we do not find in the entire chapter of the building of the gates the expression of a measure.
<b>the Tower of the Furnaces</b> He also built a tower by that name. All these towers in the chapter were built in the wall around the city.

Verse 12

<b>he and his daughters</b> Shallum and his daughters repaired the building of the structure.

Verse 13

Verse 15

<b>the ruler of the district of Mizpah</b> the prince and duke of Mizpah.
<b>he built it</b> he was building the same gate.
<b>and roofed it</b> And he laid the roof on it, an expression of a ceiling (מְטַלַלְתָּא).
<b>and the wall of the pool of Shelah</b> which inclines towards the king’s garden.
<b>and until the steps</b> They recognized these places.

Verse 16

<b>Beth Zur</b> the name of a place.

Verse 17

<b>half the district</b> From that bailiwick, the half district, he built this structure. In the word לְפִּלְכּוֹ, the “kaff” has a “dagesh,” as one says from מֶלֶךְ, מַלְכּוֹ, from עֶבֶד, עַבְדוֹ, so does one say from פֶּלֶךְ, פִּלְכּוֹ, for [if] the last letter of the noun is one of the letters “beth,” “gimmel,” “daleth,” “kaff,” “pey,” or “tav,” it is punctuated with a “dagesh.”

Verse 18

<b>their brothers</b> the Levites.

Verse 19

<b>opposite the ascent to the armory</b> opposite the place where the mighty men would ascend to the weapons. According to the simple interpretation of the verse, it appears that there was a place near the wall where the mighty men kept their weapons, as it is stated: (II Kings 10:2) “...and cities (sic) of fortification and arms.”
<b>at the corner</b> at the corner of the wall.

Verse 20

<b>repaired</b> Heb. הֶחֱרָה. Its interpretation is according to the context, and it is a double expression for repairing.

Verse 31

<b>the son of Hatzorefi</b> the goldsmith, and he was named after his craft.

Verse 32

<b>And between the ascent to the tower and the Sheep Gate</b> At the beginning of the building they began to build the Sheep Gate, as it says (verse 1): “...and they built the Sheep Gate, etc.” So did they build the wall all around, one after the other.

Verse 33



Verse 34

<b>before his brethren and the army of Samaria</b> before his brethren and the army of Samaria, who were the adversaries of Judea.
<b>What are the Jews</b> Why are the Jews doing this?
<b>the feeble</b> Heb. הָאֲמֵלָלִִים, a term denoting weakness and feebleness.
<b>Will they let them</b> Do they think that the heathens will allow them to build?
<b>Will they sacrifice</b> Will they constantly slaughter their sacrifices for themselves as they think?
<b>Will they finish in one day</b> Will they complete the work that they started in one day? That is to say that the heathens will not permit them to complete their building.

<b>from the heaps</b> Heb. מֵעֲרֵמוֹת, a term denoting heaps and mounds.
<b>for they are burnt</b> The stones were burnt and have become dust. So did they jeer and ridicule the building of the wall, which they were building from the burnt stones that had fallen to the earth from the fire when Jerusalem was burned.

Verse 35

<b>And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him</b> Tobiah was beside Sanballat.
<b>and he said</b> And so he was saying and ridiculing.
<b>Even what they build</b> even this building that they are building.
<b>if a fox comes up</b> on the building to breach the wall of the city, what will become of it? That is to say that the building cannot be repaired, and whoever wishes, can come and break into it.

Verse 36

<b>Hearken, our God</b> When I heard their ridicule of us, I prayed this prayer.
<b>in a land of captivity</b> that they be exiled from the land as we were exiled.

Verse 37

<b>And do not conceal</b> Heb. וְאַל תְּכַס, like וְאַל תְּכַסֶה, similar to (Prov. 25:9): “...but do not divulge (תְּגָל) another’s secret,” like תְּגַלֶה.
<b>for they have provoked</b> that they have provoked the builders to ridicule them.

Verse 38

<b>was built</b> Heb. וַתִּקָשֵּׁר, lit. it was bound. When the wall was bound up and built to its half, the people were eager and anxious to complete their building of it.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

Verse 2

<b>and to wreak destruction therein</b> to wreak upon the building of the wall ruin and destruction. It is like (Isa. 32:5): “...and to speak destructively (תּוֹעָה) about the Lord.”

Verse 3

<b>over them</b> over the builders.
<b>because of them</b> because of the enemies.

Verse 4

<b>And Judea said</b> So were the people of Judea saying and complaining.
<b>The porter’s strength has failed</b> Those who bear and load the stones and the wood for the building of the wall have failed in their strength, for they have no more strength to build because of the enemies.
<b>and there is much earth</b> There is still much mud and clay to place into the wall, meaning that we still have much work, but we cannot build because of fear of the enemies.

Verse 5

<b>And our adversaries said</b> Nehemiah proceeds to tell this.
<b>They will not know, and they will not see</b> So were our adversaries saying about us: “They will not know, and the Israelites will not recognize us until we come suddenly into their midst and kill them, and with this plot we will stop and curtail the building.”

Verse 6

<b>Now it came to pass when the Jews came</b> And now, the adversaries who had conspired together to wage war against us gathered with the Jews who were among them in their lands, and those Jews who had joined them came before the army, as is customary for soldiers to do, to speak to us, and in this manner the Jews conspired against the enemies. Now it came to pass when the Jews who dwelt beside them came, etc.
<b>that they said to us ten times</b> Those Jews warned us as many as ten times to wage war against our enemies because they were coming to war. And this is what they said to us, “From all the places, etc.” From all those places where you will be scattered while building the wall, here and there, be careful to assemble until you return upon us together to wage war against us.

Verse 7

<b>So I stationed from below...the wall</b> When I heard their words, I stationed [mighty men] from below that place around Jerusalem, from behind the wall of the city and on the bare rocks.
<b>according to families</b> of the people, of the mighty men among them with their weapons, to fight against our enemies when they would come.
<b>And I stationed from below, etc. and I stationed the people, etc.</b> This verse follows the pattern of (Exod. 4:9): “...and the water that you will take from the river will be...will become blood on the dry land;” (Ps. 92:10): “For behold, Your enemies, O Lord, for behold, Your enemies shall perish;” (Jud. 5:12): “Praise! Praise! Deborah. Praise! Praise! Utter a song;” (Ps. 115:1): “Not to us, O Lord, not to us.”

Verse 8

<b>And I saw, and I arose</b> And when I saw the enemies coming, I arose to speak to the nobles and to the prefects to spur them to fight against our enemy.
<b>for your brethren</b> Heb. עַל אֲחֵיכֶם, for the sake of your brethren.

Verse 9

<b>that it had become known to us</b> that they were coming to fight against us.
<b>and we all returned</b> We all returned from the place where we had gathered to meet the enemies, each one to his work in the building of the wall.

Verse 10

<b>And it was from that day on</b> And from that day on, half the mighty men worked at the building of the wall, and the remaining half of the mighty men were armed with weapons to guard their brethren who were doing the work.
<b>spears</b> Heb. וְהָרְמָחִים. The “vav” is superfluous, like the “vav” of (Gen. 36: 24): “And these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah (וְאַיָה) and Anah.”
<b>and the rulers</b> were close behind the entire tribe of Judah to be cautious in the battle.

Verse 11

<b>The builders of the wall, etc.</b> Those who were building the wall and those who were loading and carrying the loads were working with one hand, and carrying weapons with the other.
<b>the sword</b> Heb. הַשָּׁלַח, an implement of war, like (Job 33:18): “...from perishing by the sword (מֵעֲבֹר בַּשָּׁלַח). And so did Menahem associate it (Machbereth Menahem p. 174).

<b>And the builders</b> How were they building? They were all girded, each one with his sword on his waist, and thus did they build.
<b>beside me</b> He was always beside me.

Verse 13

<b>much</b> Heb. הַרְבֵּה, a great [amount of work].

Verse 14

<b>will fight for us</b> [as translated,] will fight for us.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>Let each man and his youth</b> each of the builders and a youth with him.
<b>lodge in the midst of Jerusalem</b> And the night was for their watch, and [during] the day they were doing work. The result was that they did not sleep at all.

Verse 17

<b>we did not take off our clothes</b> We were always zealous in guarding.
<b>man took it even to the water</b> This refers back to “not” above, like (I Sam. 2:3): “...let not arrogance come out of your mouth.” None of us would take off his clothes to lie down or to wash them with water, and this is a double expression, [repeating,] we did not undress.
<b>took it off</b> Heb. שִּׁלְחוֹ, taking off, like (Lev. 6: 4): “He shall then take off his garments,” which is translated by Targum as וְיִשְּׁלַח.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<b>Now the cry of the people and their wives was great</b> The poor people were crying exceedingly.
<b>about their brothers, the Jews</b> about their brothers, the rich Jews.

Verse 2

<b>There were some who were saying</b> He gives a reason for his words: Why were they crying? Some of the poor people were saying, “We are many with our sons and daughters and have to buy corn. Now we will have to sell our sons and daughters in order to buy corn in order to live.” So were they crying about the rich Jews who did not wish to support them.

Verse 3

<b>And there were some who were saying “Our fields, etc.”</b> And there were some among the poor who were complaining and saying “Our fields, vineyards and houses we shall give to others as a pledge and as security to buy corn for our food.”
<b>for the hunger</b> since the rich do not give any of their property up to us for our support.

Verse 4

<b>And there were some who were saying, “We have borrowed money”</b> And there were some who were saying, “We have already borrowed money from others on our fields and our vineyards to pay the king’s tax, and now we have nothing for our support.”
<b>for the king’s tax</b> Heb. לְמִדַּת, for the king’s tax, like (Ezra 4:13): “...the king’s due (מִנְדָּה), the head tax, and the meal tax.”

Verse 5

<b>And now, like the flesh of our brethren is our flesh</b> And now, we are as esteemed and distinguished as our brethren who are rich.
<b>like their children are our children</b> Like their children, who are esteemed and distinguished, so are our children distinguished.
<b>and behold, we are subjecting</b> And now we have to subject and deliver our sons and daughters to others for the sake of our sustenance.
<b>and some of our daughters are subjected</b> And already there are some of our daughters who are subjected to others in slavery.
<b>and we have no power</b> We do not have the ability to redeem them.
<b>and others have our fields and vineyards</b> We have even delivered our fields and vineyards to others for our sustenance. From now on, what shall we eat? We have nothing with which to sustain ourselves.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>And I thought this over to myself</b> Heb. וַיִמָלֵךְ לִבִּי עָלַי, and my heart took counsel within myself.
<b>and I contended</b> I contended with the nobles and the prefects, who were the rich people.
<b>“Are you demanding each other’s loans?”</b> Why are you doing this? You should have supported these poor people, but you are lending them money in order to appropriate their sons and daughters, their fields, vineyards and houses.
<b>and I gathered a large assembly around them</b> I congregated and gathered a large assembly around them to shout at them in order to embarrass them.

Verse 8

<b>And I said to them</b> And so I said to them: We already bought our Jewish brethren who were in captivity from the heathens to whom they were sold.
<b>with as much as we could afford</b> with as much money as was in our hands.
<b>and you too</b> And you too will sell to the heathens your brethren who are subjected to you as slaves?
<b>and they will be sold to us</b> And the result will be that they will be sold to us by the heathens (and if so, why should you sell them, since we will be compelled to redeem them? This is found in certain editions).
<b>and they remained silent</b> They were silent and ashamed, and they did not know what to answer.

Verse 9

<b>The thing...is not good</b> The thing is evil in the eyes of the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>because of the reproach</b> because of the reproach of the heathens who are our enemies.

Verse 10

<b>I, too, and my brothers and my servants</b> I, too, and my colleagues lent them money, and we shall abandon and relinquish to them all these loans.
<b>have lent</b> Heb. נֹשִׁים, like (II Kings 4:1): “...and the creditor (וְהַנֹשֶּׁה) has come to take.”

Verse 11

<b>give back</b> And you shall also do as I do, to relinquish all their debts to them.
<b>and the hundred silver pieces</b> and the large amount of money that they owe you with the corn and the wine, etc.

Verse 12

<b>And they said, “We shall return”</b> And they said [that they were willing] to return and to relinquish all.
<b>to do according to this promise</b> that they too should relinquish.

Verse 13

<b>I also shook out my garment</b> Heb. חָצְנִי, I also shook out my garment. חָצְנִי is like (Isa. 49: 22): “...and they shall bring your sons on the skirt of their garments (בְּחֹצֶן).”
<b>my garment</b> is escrol(l)e in Old French, I shook out, like (ibid. 52:2): “Shake yourself (הִתְנַעֲרִי) from the dust.”
<b>So shall...shake out</b> So shall the Holy One, blessed be He, shake out from the world and from their property those who do not relinquish their debts.
<b>shake out and empty</b> without property.

Verse 14

<b>that he commanded me</b> i.e., the king.
<b>governor</b> Heb. פֶּחָם, like פֶּחָה, ruler, after the pattern of רֵיקָם, empty, like רֵֵֵיקָה.
<b>from the twentieth year</b> of King Darius, for then he ascended from Babylon, as it is stated (2:1): “Now it came to pass in the month of Nissan in the twentieth year, etc.”
<b>twelve years</b> which equal twelve years.
<b>my brethren and I</b> I and my colleagues who came with me.
<b>have not eaten the food allotted to the governor</b> the food that was fit for the governor, which the people give the governor from the tax.

Verse 15
