Rashi on Exodus



Chapter 1



Verse 1

Even though they were counted in their lifetimes to tell their names, we go back and count them again to emphasize their greatness. They are compared to stars, who are counted in name and number. Like it says in Isaiah, ,"הַמּוֹצִיא בְמִסְפָּר צְבָאָם; לְכֻלָּם, בְּשֵׁם יִקְרָא"

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

And weren't him and his childen already known to be in Egypt? What does this come to teach us? Not because the brothers were unaware that he was in Egypt, but to emphasize Joseph's righteousness. He was Joseph when he was the shepherd who watched his father's sheep.  He was Joseph when he was in Egypt and became viceroy and stood in righteousness.

Verse 6



Verse 7

That there women did not miscarry and did not die when they were young.
They were giving birth to six children at one time.

Verse 8

Rav and Shmuel argue on this. One says it was actually a new king and the other says that he renewed his decrees.
He made himself like he didn't know who Joseph was.

Verse 9



Verse 10

This wording is used as wording for preparation and planning, like saying you must prepare yourselves for this.
To the nation. We must be wise about what to do with it. And our rabbis expound "we must be wise about the savior of the Israelites, and to drown him in the water, because God promised never to bring another flood upon the world. (they did not understand that God would never flood the entire world but he would flood one area.)
Against our will, and our Rabbis taught [that it is] like a man who curses himself and lays his curse on others, and it is as if it were written 'and we will rise up from the land, and they will inherit it.'

Verse 11

On the nation.
The language of 'tax', ministers that collect from them taxes. And what is the tax? That they built storage cities for Pharaoh.
Of the Egyptians.
As it is translates. Similarly: "Go, come to this steward" (Isaiah 22:15), the treasurer that was appointed on the treasury.
They were not initially fit for this, and therefore they made them stronger and fortified for the treasure.

Verse 12

In any way in which they deigned to oppress, that was where the heart of the Holy Blessed One [saw fit to] increase and spread out.
Thus they increased and thus they spread out. The Midrash says that the Holy Spirit said: you [the Egyptians] say 'lest you increase' and I say 'thus they will increase' (Sotah 11a).
Became disgusted in their own lives [by the Israelites]. Our Rabbis explained: they [the Israelites] became as thorns (kotzim) in their eyes (Sotah 11a).

Verse 13

With hard work that crushed the body and broke it (Sotah 11a).

Verse 14



Verse 15

This is the language of those who give birth, but there is a heavy word [with a dagesh in the lamed] and a light word [without a dagesh in the lamed], like the words 'shober' and 'meshaber', 'dover' and 'medaber', so too 'moleed' and 'meyaled'.
This is Yocheved, due to her beautifying the newborn.
This is Miriam, due to her crying and cooing to the newborn, in the manner of women who appease crying children. 
The language of screaming, like "now I will cry like a travailing woman" (Isaiah 42:14).

Verse 16



He was particular only about males, because his astrologists told him that a boy, who would redeem them would be born in the future.

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

"He made them houses." - Houses of priesthood, Levitehood, and royalty, which are called "houses" - (I Kings 9:1): "the building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house." Priesthood and Levitehood - from Jochebed, and royalty - from Miriam, as is explained in Tractate Sotah (Sotah 11b).

Verse 22

<b>all his people.</b> He decreed even upon them. The day that Moses was born, his astrologers told him, "Their savior was born today, we don't know if he is of Egypt or of Israel, and we see that he is destined to be smitten with water." Therefore, he decreed on that day, even upon the Egyptians, as it says "every son that is born," and it does not say "every son that is born to the Hebrews." They did not know that he was destined to be smitten on account of the waters of Meribah.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

Your decree is harsher than פַּרְעֹה. Whereas Pharaoh issued a decree [only] against the males, you [issued a decree] against the females as well [for none will be born]

Verse 2

She saw that he was good: When he was born the entire house was filled with light.

Verse 14




Now I understand the matter. As it implies. Midrashic interpretation; I understand the matter which I was wondering about, what sin did Israel do from more than all the 70 nations to be subjugated in work and labor, but I see that they are deserving of it.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

I Am as I Am - I will be with them in this time of distress just as I will be with them during the suppression of other kingdoms.  [Moshe] said, "Master of the Universe, why do I need to mention other distress?  This travail is sufficient!"  He said to him, "You have spoken well.  This shall you say, etc."

<b>Leprous, as white as snow:</b> It is the way of leprosy to be white (Leviticus 13:4). And if it [was] a white pockmark, with this sign too did He hint that [Moshe] told over evil speech in his saying (verse 1), "they will not believe me." Therefore He afflicted him with leprosy, like Miriam had been afflicted [with it] because of evil speech.

On the way to the inn: on Moshe’s way to the inn.
He sought to put him to death: [the angel] sought to kill Moshe since he had not circumcised his son Eliezer, and because he had been negligent he was worthy of the death penalty. It was taught: Rabbi Yosse said – Heaven forbid! Moshe was not [simply being] negligent; rather, he [had a thoughtful consideration] ‘if I circumcise my son and head out on the road the baby will be at risk for [the next]three days. [On the other hand] if I circumcise him and stay [in Midyan] for three days [I will be going against that which] the Holy One has commanded me to do [when G-d said] “Go, return to Egypt!” If so (if his considerations were plausible) why was he punished?! Because [when they reached the place] he dealt first with the issue of lodging [and not circumcision]. The angel became like a kind of a serpent and was swallowing him [Moshe] from his head down to his hips, then back, then swallowing him from his feet up to that same place. Tziporah understood that [the attack] was due to  milah circumcision.

Because of impatience of spirit-- when someone is upset, their spirit and breath are shortened and they cannot breathe deeply. Similarly, I heard this explanation from Rabbi Baruch son of Rabbi Eliezer, and he brought me proof from this verse (Jeremiah 17:21): "At this time I will let them know my power and strength and they will know that my name is the LORD." We learn from this that the Holy One, Blessed be He, fulfills his word-- even when it is for punishment, he announces that his name is "LORD." How much more so when he fulfills his word to do good! And our teachers taught with regard to the above, that when Moses said "Why have you harmed" the Holy One said "Alas for those who have been lost and cannot be found. I must mourn the death of the Patriarchs: many times, I revealed myself to them as 'Almighty God' and they never said 'What is your name?' But you asked 'What is his name that I may tell them?'"

Every first-born in the land of Egypt. Even other firstborns and they are in Egypt. And from where [do we learn that it applied to] Egyptian firstborns in other places? It says (Psalms 136:10) "Who strikes Egypt in their firstborns".
From man until beast. He who started the sin, from him the punishment began.
And to all the gods of Egypt. Of wood, they would rot. Of metal, they would melt and be poured to the earth.
I will judge, I am Hashem. I myself, and not through a messenger.

And you shall observe [the Feast of] Unleavened Bread [matzot].

R' Josiah says, "Do not read "unleavened bread" but rather "commandments" (mitzvot), just as we do not allow the matza to become leavened, we do not allow [our performance of] a commandment to become leavened, rather if the opportunity to perform the commandment arises do so immediately.

If there was a firstborn -- he died. If there wasn't, the oldest in the house was called a firstborn, as it says (Psalms 89:28) "I also will appoint him first-born". Another thing: Egyptian women would prostitute themselves beneath their husbands and bore children of open men, and would have many firstborns, even five to one mother, each from a different father.

"And Miriam the Prophetess took." Where had she prophesied? When she was the sister of Aaron, before Moses was born, she said, 'In the future, my mother will give birth to a son, etc.' Like there in Sota (13a), another reason, she was called the sister of Aaron because he gave his soul to her when she had leprosy, she was called by his name.
"The timbrel." Types of instruments
"With timbrels and with dances." From this certainty and faith, she was considered righteous, because they believed that God would make miracles for them, and therefore they brought timbrels from Egypt.

Verse 21

"Moses sang the song to the men, he said it, and they repeated after him, and Miriam said the song for the women."

1) Moshe's goal was to turn Yitro's visit from just a way of Yitro recognizing the great nissim to translate into Yitro growing closer to Torah. Chazal even tell us that Yitro converted based on Moshe pulling him close.

Chapter 19



Verse 1

"On that day" - On Rosh Hodesh (Bavli Shabbat 86).  It could have simply written "on that day," so why did it write "on this day?" So that the words of the Torah shall be new unto you like on the day they were given.

Verse 2

1 "They traveled from Rephidim" - Why did the text need to go back and make explicit from where they had traveled? Had it not already written that they had been camping in Rephidim, so it would be known that they had traveled from there. Rather, it came to compare their traveling from Rephidim to their arrival in the Sinai desert -- just as their arrival to the desert of Sinai through repentance, their traveling from Rephidim was through repentance. (Mekhilta)
2 "Israel camped there" - Like one person with one heart.  But all of their other encampments took place with complaining and disagreement. (Mekhilta)
3 "Next to the mountain" - To the east (Mekhilta), and everywhere where you find the word "next to," it means 'faced to the east.'

Verse 3

 "And Moshe went up" - On the second day. And all of his goings up were at daybreak as it is written (Exodus 34: 4) "Moshe arose in the morning."
 "Thus shall you say" According to these words and in this order (Bavli Shabbat 86b).
 "To the house of Jacob" - These are the women, you shall speak to them in soft speech.
 "And speak to the children of Israel" - He explained the punishments and minutiae to the males, and difficult matters such [the laws of] sinews (Mekhilta). 

Verse 4

"You have seen" (Shabbat 86b) It is not a tradition in your hands or words which I transmitted to you, and I did not testify to you through witnesses. Rather, you saw what I did to Egypt, and how many sins they had been liable for before you became attached to them, and I did not pay them for their sins except through you.
"I will lift you" - (Mekhilta) This is the day that Israel arrived in Ramses.  The Israelites were scattered across the whole land of Goshen, and in a small amount of time when they went to journey and leave, they were all gathered to Ramses. And Onkelos translated "and I will raise" as "I will lift you" similar to "I will carry you," he edited the language in order to give respect to heaven.
"On the wings of eagles" - As an eagle carries its young on its wings. All of the other birds place their children between their wings as they are afraid of another bird swooping down upon their backs. But the eagle is only afraid of humans who may shoot an arrow at it, since no other bird will swoop on its back.  Therefore, it places its young upon its back and says, 'better that the arrow enter into me and not into my children.' I [God] also did this, [as it is written:] "the angel of God traveled going before the camp of Israel" (Exodus 14:19) and "[the Angel of God] came between the camp of Egypt [and between the camp of Israel]" (Exodus 14:20) and the Egyptians were throwing arrows and catapulting stones and the cloud took their blow.
"And I will bring you to me" - according to its translation [into Aramaic by Onkelos].

Verse 5

"And now" - If you accept it upon yourselves now, it will become pleasing to you [beginning] from here and in the future, since all beginnings are difficult. (Mekhilta; Bavli Shabbat 87a)
"And if you keep my covenant" - Which I will make with you about keeping the Torah.
"Treasure" - A beloved trove like "the treasure of Kings" (Ecclesiastes 2:8), a precious vessel with beautiful stones where the king stores them. Thus, you should be for me a treasure from the other nations.  You should not say that you alone are mine and I do not have any others with you. I do this all the more so my love of you is known since all of the earth is mine and they [Israel] are in my eyes and before me more than anything else.

Verse 6

"You shall be for me a kingdom of priests" - Princes as it is written (II Samuel 8:18) "And the sons of David were priests."
"These are the words" - Not more or less.

Verse 7



Verse 8

"Moshe brought the words of the people..." - On the next day which was the third day, as he went up at daybreak. And did Moshe need to answer God [i. e. did God not already know what the people said]? Rather, the text comes to teach us proper etiquette, that he did not say 'the one who sent me already knows and I do not need to answer him.'

This tells that the Shechinah came toward them as a groom going out ot meet the bride. This is the meaning of: “God came from Sinai” and it does not say: “Came to Sinai.” 

Chapter 20



Verse 1

And Elokim spoke: There is no (mention of) Elokim but as a judge; Because there are sections (verses) in the Torah that a person that performs them receives merit (reward), and should he refrain from doing them he does not receive punishment, it might be thought, that this also applies to the  10 commandments. To teach us otherwise the Torah says: and Elokim spoke - (the usage of the name Elokim means) a judge that punishes (Mechilta).

And He gave Moses, etc. There is no antecedent and subsequent [i.e., chronological order] [invariably] in the Torah. The incident of the [golden] calf precedes the commandment to construct the sanctuary by many days. It was on the seventeenth of Tammuz when the tablets were broken, and on Yom Hakippurim when the Holy One, Blessed Be He, was conciliated by Israel. And the next day they [i.e., Israel] began to donate to the Mishkan, which was erected on the first of Nissan.

Verse 2

On your wives' ears. Aaron said in his heart [i.e., to himself], "The women and the children adore their jewelry. Maybe this issue can be delayed, and Moses will come during that time." But they did not wait, and removed it from themselves. 
Remove. An imperative mode, derived from the singular "parek." This is like "barekhu" [bless], derived from "barekh."

YHVH YHVH. This is the attribute of mercy, one before a person will sin, and one after a person will sin and repent.
GOD. This too is the attribute of mercy, and thus the Torah says, "My God, My God, why did You abandon me?" (Psalms 22:2) One wouldn't want to say to the attribute of judgment, "Why did You abandon me?" I found this [teaching] in the Mekhilta. 
LONG-SUFFERING. God lengthens his anger and does not rush to settle a score, lest [the person] do teshuvah.
AND ABUNDANT LOVING-KINDNESS. For those who need loving-kindness since they do not have so many merits.
AND TRUTH. To pay a good reward to those who do God's will.
