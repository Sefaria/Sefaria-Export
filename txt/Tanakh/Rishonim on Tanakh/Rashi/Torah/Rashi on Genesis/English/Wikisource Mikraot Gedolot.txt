Rashi on Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

Rabbi Yitzchak said: [God] could have begun the Torah only from 'This month shall be to you' (Exodus 12:2), which is the first mitzvah (precept) which Israel was commanded. So what is the reason that [God] began with 'In the beginning'? Because of [the idea expressed in the verse]: '[God] has declared to His people the power of His works, in order to give them the heritage of the nations' (Psalms 111:6). Thus, should the nations of the world say to Israel: 'You are robbers, having conquered the lands of the seven [Canaanite] nations [by force],' [Israel] can say to them: 'The whole earth belongs to the Holy Blessed One; He created it and gave it to whomever He saw fit. By His will He gave it to [the Canaanite seven nations], and by His will He took it from them and gave it to us.'
