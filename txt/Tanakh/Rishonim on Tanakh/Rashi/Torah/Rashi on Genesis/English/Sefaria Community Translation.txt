Chapter 1



Verse 1


2 "...to say that these [sky on day 2 verse 8 and land on day 3 verse 10] were earlier [than light], if it came to teach that..."

Verse 2

1 astonishingly empty: Heb. תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ. The word תֹהוּ is an expression of astonishment and desolation, that a person wonders and is astonished at the emptiness therein.
2astonishingly empty: Astordison in Old French; [étourdissement in modern French], astonishment. בֹהוּ an expression of emptiness and desolation. (This does not appear in all editions.)
3 בֹהוּ: an expression of emptiness and desolation. (This does not appear in all editions.)
4 on the face of the deep: on the face of the waters which were on the earth.
5 and the spirit of God was hovering: The Throne of Glory was suspended in the air and hovered over the face of the water with the breath of the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He and with His word, like a dove, which hovers over the nest, acoveter in Old French, to cover, hover over.

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>And God saw the light that it was good, and He separated:</b> Also here, we need the words of the aggadah (homiletical teachings): He saw it, [and saw] that it was not proper for the wicked to use it; so He separated it for the righteous in the future. And according to its simple meaning, explain it as follows: He saw it, that it was good, and it was unseemly that [light] and darkness should serve in a mishmash; so He established for this one its boundary by day, and for that one its boundary by night.

Verse 5

<b>One day:</b> According to the order [language] of the section, it should have written, "the first day," as it is written with the other days - second, third, fourth - [so] why is is written, "one?" Because the Holy One, blessed be He, was one in His world, as the angels were not created until the second day. Thus is it explained in Bereishit Rabbah 3:8.

Verse 6

<b>"Let there be a firmament:"</b> Let the firmament harden. Since, even though the heavens were created on the first day, they were still wet, and they solidified on the second from the scolding of the Holy One, blessed be He, in his saying, "Let there be a firmament." And this is what is written (Job 26:11), "The pillars of the heavens were shaking" the entire first day and on the second, "they were astounded by his scolding," like a person that is confounded and stops by the scolding of someone threatening him.   
<b>"In the midst of the waters:"</b> In the middle of the waters, as there is a space between the higher waters and the firmament just like there is [one] between the firmament and the waters on the earth. Behold, you have learned that they are suspended by the word of the King. 

Verse 7

<b>And God made the firmament:</b> He arranged it in its position; and that is its making, as per (Deuteronomy 21:12), "and she made her nails." 
<b>From over (<i>me'al</i>) the firmament:</b> It does not state, over (<i>al</i>) the firmament, but rather, from over the firmament; since they are suspended in the air. And why does it not state, "it was good," on the second day? Because the work of the water was not completed until the third day; and behold, He [only] started it on the second [day], and something that is not finished is not in its fullness and goodness. And on the third [day], when the work of the water was completed and He started a different work and completed it, He repeated "it was good" twice on it - one for the finishing of the work of the second [day] and one for the finishing of the work of that day.

Verse 8

<b>And God called the firmament, heavens (<i>shamayim</i>):</b> Lift waters (<i>sa mayim</i>); over there are waters (<i>sham mayim</i>; fire and water (<i>esh oumayim</i>) that He mixed together, one with the other, and made heavens from them.

Verse 9

<b>"Let the waters gather:"</b> They were spread over the face of the whole earth and he gathered them in the <i>Okiyanus</i> (the Ocean), which is the largest of all the seas.

Verse 10

<b>He called seas:</b> And is it not [all] one sea? Except that the taste of fish that comes up [from the sea] in Akko (Acre) is not the same as the taste of the fish that comes up [from the sea] in Espamia. 

Verse 11

<b>"Let the earth bring forth grass (<i>desheh esev</i>):"</b> <i>Desheh</i> is not an expression of <i>esev</i> and <i>esev</i> is not an expression of <i>desheh</i>, and [so] the expression of Scripture could not have [been], <i>taasiv haarets</i> [exchanging one word for the other]. Since types of <i>deshaim</i> are divided, each one by itself is called a certain <i>esev</i>. And it is not common parlance to say a certain <i>desheh</i>, since <i>desheh</i> is an expression of covering the earth when it is full of grasses. 
<b>"Let the earth bring forth:"</b> Let it be filled and covered with a mantle of herbs. In [Old French], <i>desheh</i> is called <i>erbediz</i> [a collective of herbs] all of them in a mixture, whereas each root individually is called <i>esev</i>.
<b>"That produces seed:"</b>That its seed should grow in it, so as to sow from it in a different place.
<b>"Fruit trees:"</b> That the taste of the tree should be like the taste of the fruit. And [the earth] did not do so, but rather (verse 14) “the earth gave forth, etc. trees producing fruit,” and the trees [themselves] were not fruit. Therefore, when man was cursed because of his iniquity, it [the earth] too was remembered for its iniquity and was cursed.
<b>"The seed of which is in it:"</b> These are the pits [seeds] of every fruit, from which the tree grows when it is planted.

Verse 12

<b>And the earth brought forth, etc.:</b> Even though "according to its species" is not stated concerning the grasses when they were commanded, [nonetheless] they heard that the trees were commanded thus; and they brought up an a fortiori argument (<i>kal vechomer</i>) regarding themselves, as is explained in the aggadah (homiletical teachings) in Chapter <i>Shechitat Chullin</i> (Chullin 60a).

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>"Let there be luminaries:"</b> They were created from the first day; and on the fourth day, He commanded them to be suspended in the heavens. And so [too], all of the issue of the heavens and the earth were created from the first day, and each one was affixed on the day that was decreed about it. That is why it is written (verse 1), "<i>et</i> (a Hebrew preposition,  which can either proceed a direct object or mean 'with,' and so, is often seen as indicating additional meaning) <i>hashamayim</i> (the heavens)," in order  to include their issue,”and "<i>et haarets</i> (the earth)," in order  to include its issue.
<b>"Let there be luminaries:"</b> Luminaries (<i>meorot</i>) is written [in its incomplete spelling] lacking the [letter,] <i>vav</i>. [It can thus also be read as the word, curses (<i>ma'arot</i>)], since it is the day of the curse that babies get sick with croup. And that is what we learned (Sofrim 17:5), “on the fourth day [Wednesdays], they would fast so that the babies would not get sick with croup.”
<b>"To separate between the day and the night:"</b> [This happened] after the first light was hidden away, but during the seven days of Creation, the first light and the first darkness served - whether by day or whether by night.
<b>"And they will be for signs:</b>" When the luminaries are eclipsed, it is a bad sign for the world, as it is stated (Jeremiah 10:2),  "from the signs of the sky do not fear;" [meaning that only] when you do the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, do you not need to fear from calamity.
<b>"And for appointed times:"</b> [It was stated] based on the future, since in the future, Israel would be commanded regarding the festivals; and those would be [determined based] on the appearance of the [new] moon.
 <b>"And for days:"</b> The service of the sun is half a day and the service of the moon is [for the duration] of its [other] half; behold that is a full day. 
<b>"And for years:"</b> At the end of 365 days, they complete their orbit through the twelve constellations that serve them - and that is a year.  (And they go back and begin to rotate around the circuit like their first trajectories a second time.)  

Verse 15

<b>"And they shall be for luminaries:"</b> They will also serve in this way - that they will illuminate the world.

Verse 16

1 the two great luminaries: They were created equal, but the moon was made smaller because it brought charges and said, “It is impossible for two kings to use the same crown.” - [from Chullin 60b] Rashi (ad loc.) explains that this derash is based on the discrepancy of the two expressions, “the two great luminaries,” which intimates that the moon was a great luminary, and“the lesser luminary,” which intimates that the moon was smaller than the sun. To reconcile this difference, the Rabbis asserted that the moon was originally created equal to the sun, but, because of its complaint that the sun wielded the same power that it wielded, it was forced to relinquish that power.
2 and the stars: Because He diminished the moon, He increased its hosts, to appease it. - [from Gen. Rabbah 46:4 and Chullin 60b] i.e., The stars serve as the entourage of the moon. When it comes out, they accompany it, and when it sets, they too set. [Gen. Rabbah ad loc.]

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>"Living souls:"</b> That has life in it.
<b>"Swarming thing (<i>sherets</i>):"</b> Every living thing that is not very high from the ground is called <i>sherets</i>: among flying creatures, such as flies; among insects, such as ants, beetles and worms; and among the [four legged] creatures, such as the weasel, the mouse, the lizard, and their like; and all of the fish. 

Verse 21

1 the…sea monsters: The great fish in the sea, and in the words of the Aggadah (B.B. 74b), this refers to the Leviathan and its mate, for He created them male and female, and He slew the female and salted her away for the righteous in the future, for if they would propagate, the world could not exist because of them. הַתַּנִינִם is written. [I.e., the final “yud,” which denotes the plural, is missing, hence the implication that the Leviathan did not remain two, but that its number was reduced to one.]- [from Gen. Rabbah 7:4, Midrash Chaseroth V’Yetheroth, Batei Midrashoth, vol 2, p. 225].
2 living creature: a creature in which there is life.

Verse 22

<b> And He blessed them:</b> Because [man] eliminates and hunts from them and [he] eats them, the blessing was needed. And [so,] also the animals needed a blessing, except that because of the snake that would receive a curse in the future; for that reason He did not bless them, so that it would not be included.
<b>"Be fruitful:"</b> It is an expression of fruit; which means to say, "make fruit."
<b>"And multiply:"</b> If He had only said, "be fruitful," one would have given birth to one and no more; and [so] comes "and multiply," so that one [can] give birth [to] many.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>"Let the earth bring forth:"</b> That is what I explained (verse 14) - that everything was created from the first day and it was only necessary to bring them out.
<b>"Living souls:"</b> That has life in it.
<b>"And crawling things (<i>remes</i>):</b>" These are the creeping things, which are low and crawl upon the earth [and] appear as if they are dragging along, because their movement is not discernible. All expressions of <i>remes</i> and <i>sherets</i> in our language are <i>conmovres</i> (crawling things) in [Old French]. 

Verse 25

<b>And he made:</b> He refined them to be in their desired state and in their [full] stature.

Verse 26

<b>"Let us make man:"</b> We learn of the humility of the Holy One, blessed be He, from here. Since man was in the image of the angels and they would [hence] be jealous of him, therefore He took counsel with them. And when He judges kings, He consults with His retinue [of angels]; since thus we find with Achav, who was told by Micha (I Kings 22:19), "I have seen the Lord sitting on His throne, and the entire host of the heavens was standing over Him, on His right and on His left." And is there right and left in [His presence]? Rather [the intention is that], these were going to the right to find merit and those were going to the left to find guilt. And so [too] (Daniel 4:14), "The decree is in the word of the wakeful ones and in the statement of the holy ones is the proposition." Also here did He consult with His retinue and get their agreement: He said to them, "there are in the higher ones like my likeness, if there are not in the lower ones like my likeness, behold, there will be jealousy within the work of creation."
<b>"Let us make man:"</b> Even though they did not help Him in [man's] formation and there is [now] room for the heretics to rebel, the verse did not stop from teaching proper behavior and the trait of humility - that the greater should consult with and get the agreement of the lesser. And had it written, "I will make man," we would not learn that He spoke with His court, but rather [only] with Himself. And the answer to the heretics is written at its side: "And God created (<i>yivra</i> which is singular) man," and it did not write <i>yivrau</i> (plural).
<b>"In our image:"</b> In our mold.
<b>"According to our likeness:"</b> To understand and to have insight.
<b>"And they shall have dominion (<i>yirdu</i>) over the fish of the sea:"</b> This expression contains [both] an expression of dominion (<i>ridui</i>) and an expression of descent (<i>yeridah</i>). [Hence, it is saying that] if [man] merits [it], he will have dominion over the animals and the beasts; if he does not merit [it], he will become lowly in front of them and the animals will rule over him. 

Verse 27

<b>And God created man in His image:</b> In the mold that was made for him - since everything was created with a proclamation, but he was created manually, as it is written, (Psalms 139:5) "and you placed your palm upon me." He was made with an imprint like a coin that is made with an impression that is called <i>coin</i> (coin) in [Old French]. And so it states (Job 38:14), "The seal changes like clay." 
<b>In the image of God, did He create him:</b> It explains to you that this image which was prepared for him is the image of the facsimile of his Creator.
<b>Male and female, He created them:</b> And later it states (Genesis 2:21), "And He took one of his ribs, etc." There is a midrash aggadah [that explains] that He created him with two faces at the first creation and afterwards divided him. And the simple explanation is [that] here it is telling you that both of them were created on the sixth day and it does not explain how their creation [happened], and it explains [it] to you in a different place.

Verse 28

<b>"And subdue it:"</b> It is missing a [letter,] <i>vav</i> (and so could be read as <i>kavshah</i>, which means subdues her); to teach you that the male subdues the female from being unrestrained. And also, it is to teach you that since it is his way to conquer, the man is commanded in being fruitful and multiplying, and not the woman. 

Verse 29

<b>"To you shall they be for food and for all of the animals of the earth:"</b> The verse equated them with the beasts and the animals concerning food, and [so] did not permit Adam and his wife to kill a creature and eat meat. Rather, only all green herbs would they all eat together. And when the sons of Noach arrived (after the flood), He permitted meat to them, as it is stated (below, Genesis 9:3), "every crawling thing, which is alive, etc. like the green herb" which I permitted to Adam, "have I given you everything." 

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b>The sixth day:</b> It added [the letter,] <i>hay</i>, to the word, sixth, (making it read, <i>the</i> sixth day, whereas all of the other days were not preceded with a <i>hay</i>), to say that He made a condition with [the acts of creation], that [the creation] was on condition that Israel would accept the five (which is the numerical equivalent of <i>hay</i>) books of the Torah. A different [explanation]: The sixth day - they were all dependent and waiting until <i>the</i> sixth day; that is the sixth of Sivan, which was [the day] prepared for the giving of the Torah. (Other editions: Since on the sixth day of Sivan, on which Israel received the Torah, the entire creation was strengthened; and it was considered as if the world was created then. And that is what is meant by <i>the</i> sixth day with a <i>hay</i>; that the day [referred to] was the sixth of Sivan.) 

Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2

And God completed on the seventh day: Rabbi Shimon said: [A human being of] flesh and blood, who cannot [exactly] know his times and his moments, must add from the profane to the holy [i.e., he must add some time to the Sabbath.] The Holy One, blessed be He, Who knows His times and His moments [exactly], entered it [the Sabbath] within a hairbreadth, and it therefore appeared as if He completed it [His work] on that day. Another explanation: What was the world lacking? Rest. The Sabbath came, and so came rest. The work was completed and finished. — [from Gen. Rabbah 10:9]

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5


Because it had not rained (heading).  And what was the reason it had not rained, because man did not yet exist to work the land and could not recognize the goodness of rain, and when man came and knew that they were needed for the world, he prayed about them and they fell, and the trees and the grass sprouted.

Verse 6

according to the purpose of man's creation, God brought up the abyss and water the clouds, soaking the earth and man was created, as this baker that gives water  then kneads the dough, from here God watered [the earth] and then formed [him]. 

Verse 7


He gathered dust from all the land from the four directions, so that in every place he would die in, the earth would receive him for burial. Alternatively, he took his dust from the place upon which it says, "An altar of earth you shall make for Me" (Exodus 20), He said, 'If only it may serve as atonement for him, and he may be able to stand'.

<b>"A help opposite him (<i>kenegdo</i>):"</b> If he merits [it], a help. If he does not merit [it], against him (an alternative meaning of <i>kenegdo</i>) to fight.

"and they were not embarrassed". Because they were not aware of [the concept of] (lit. path of) modesty [which requires the ability] to distinguish between good and evil. And although he was given [enough] awareness to name all the animals, he was not given the Evil Inclination until he ate from the tree and [only then] was imbued with the Evil Inclination and became aware of the difference between good and evil.

and they knew that they were naked: Even a blind man knows when he is naked! What then is the meaning of “and they knew that they were naked” ? They had one commandment in their possession, and they became denuded of it.

Verse 8

(8) And they heard- there are many medrashic agadot, and they have already been organized in Bereishit Raba and in other Medrashot. I have only come to (arrive at or help explain) pshuto shel mikra, the plain meaning of the text, and to (bring at times) the agadic works that settle the words of the Torah, each word in its place.

This one will provide ease for us: The toil of our hands will be eased. Until Noach arrived nobody had a plow, and he created one for them. The land would produce thistles and thorns when wheat was planted, as a result of the curse of Adam, but in the times of Noach this was eased. And that is "will provide ease for us" - will be eased from us. And if you do not interpret in this manner, the meaning of the word does not align with his name, and instead he should be called Menachem.

the sons of the nobles. Another explanation: בְּנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים are the princes who go as messengers of the Omnipresent. They too mingled with them. Every אֱלֹהִים in Scripture is an expression of authority, and the following proves it (Exod. 4:16): “And you shall be to him as a lord (לֵאלֹהִים)”; (Eodus 7:1): “See, I have made you a lord (אֶלֹהִים).”

"In his generation..." -  (Sanhedrin 109) Some of our rabbis interpret this as praise, meaning, all the more so, if he had been in a generation filled with righteous people, he would have been even more righteous.  And there are those who interpret it as criticism, meaning, if he had been in Abraham's generation, he would not have been thought of as anything special.
"Noah walked with God..." - And with Abraham it says (Genesis 24): "Walk before Me!"  Noah needed support to keep him up, but Abraham would strengthen himself and walk righteously on his own.

So that when the people of the generation of the Flood saw him busy with it for 120 years and they asked him: "What are you doing?" He could respond to them: "In the future, the Holy One of Blessing will bring a flood upon the earth" - and thus perhaps they would repent.
<b>Gopher wood:</b> That is its name. And why of this material? [Hinting] at the name of brimstone ("<i>gofrith</i>"), which they were decreed to be erased with.

Verse 1

"And Elokim remembered" - This name (Elokim) is associated with the attribute of (strict) Judgement. (God' interaction with the world was) switched to the attribute of mercy through the teffilot of the righteous, as the wickedness of the wicked transform (God's interaction with the world from) the attribute of mercy to the attribute (strict) judgement as it is stated "and Hashem saw that the wickedness of man had become great...", "and Hashem said, I will erase..." and Hashem is the name associated with the attribute of mercy.

Verse 1

"Go, yourself" - For your benefit, and for your own good, and there I will make you into a great nation.  Here you will not merit children.  And what's more, I will let the world know all about you.

Verse 2



"and you will be a blessing". The [rights to give] blessings are given into your hand. Until now, [the rights to give blessings] were in my hands. I blessed Adam, Noah, and You. From now on, you will bless whoever you want. Another understanding [of the idea behind "and you will be a blessing"]: "and I will make you into a great nation" [refers] to that which is said [in the Shmoneh Esreh prayer] "the God of Abraham". "and I will bless you" [refers] to that which is said [in the Shmoneh Esreh prayer] "the God of Isaac". "and I will make your name great" [refers] to that which is said [in the Shmoneh Esreh prayer] "the God of Jacob". [You might think that the first paragraph of the Shmoneh Esreh] should be concluded [with a blessing formulated to include mention of] all [of the forefathers], [but really the Torah] says "and YOU will be a blessing", [meaning] [the nation of Israel] will conclude [first paragraph of the Shmoneh Esreh] with you, but not with them (i.e. the other forefathers).

Verse 3

"And be blessed through you" - there are many Legends and Traditions on this idea and this is their essence: A man will say to his son 'Be like Avraham'.  And this is the meaning of all expressions of 'be blessed through you' in Scripture.  And the proof is (Genesis 48) 'Through you shall Israel be blessed, May God make you like Ephraim and Menasheh'.

Verse 4



Verse 5

"that they 'made' in Haran"-they brought them under the wings of the Shechina (God's presence); Abraham would convert the men and Sarah would convert the women, the Torah writes it as if they 'created' them (that's why it says 'made')...

Continually traveling: lit. going and traveling. [He traveled] in intervals, staying here for a month or more, traveling from there, and pitching his tent elsewhere. And all his travels were southward, to go to the south of the Land of Israel, and that is to the direction of Jerusalem, which is in the territory of Judah, who took [his portion] in the south of the Land of Israel, to Mount Moriah, which was his [Judah’s] heritage.

Verse 11

And the birds of prey: Heb. הָעַיִט. This is a bird, and [it is called עַיִט] because it swoops down [עָט] and seeks the carcasses. Like (Job 9:26): “to swoop upon food,” and like (I Sam. 15:19): “and you flew (וַתַּעַט) upon the spoil.”
upon the carcasses: upon the parts. (Other editions: הַפְּגָרִים is translated into Aramaic as פַּגְלַיָא, [meaning “carcass,” and not “parts,” as Rashi interprets]. But because they [the Targumim] were accustomed to translating אִישׁ בִּתְרוֹ [verse 10] as וִיהַב פַּלְגַּיָא [meaning: “He placed each part”], the word פַּגְלַיָא was mistakenly changed to פַּלְגַּיָא, and they therefore translated הַפְּגָרִים as פַּלְגַיָא. But whoever translates that way is in error, because we cannot equate בְּתָרִים, parts, to פְּגָרִים, carcasses, for בְּתָרִים should be translated פַּלְגַּיָא, and פְּגָרִים should be translated פַּגְלַיָא, an expression of פִּגוּל, an abominable thing, as (Lev. 19:7): “it is an abominable thing (פִּגוּל),” an expression of a carcass. (So I heard from Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Samuel.) And so it was emended in a Rashi ms., and in another ms. was written: So did Rabbi Meir the son of Rabbi Samuel explain.)
and Abram drove them away: Heb. וַיַּשֵּׁב, an expression of blowing and causing to fly away, like (Ps. 147:18): “He causes His wind to blow (יַשֵּׁב).” This is an allusion that David the son of Jesse will come to destroy them, but they will not permit him from heaven [to do so] until the King Messiah arrives. [from Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, ch. 28]

And the fourth generation: After they will have been exiled to Egypt, they will be there for three generations, and the fourth will return to this land (Mishnath Rabbi Eliezer ch. 5), for in the land of Canaan He spoke with him, and formed this covenant, as it is written (above verse 7): “to give you this land to inherit it.” And so it was: Jacob descended to Egypt. Go forth and figure his generations: Judah, Perez, and Hezron, and Caleb the son of Hezron was one of those who entered the land (Sotah 11b).
for the iniquity of the Amorites will not be complete: that they should be sent out of their land until that time, for the Holy One, blessed be He, does not punish a nation until its measure is full, as it is said: (Isa. 27:8):“When her measure is full, when You send her away, then You will strive with her.” - [from Zohar, vol. 1, p. 113b]

Verse 17

Now it came to pass that the sun had set: Heb. וַיְהִי הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ בָּאָה. [The subject apparently does not agree with the predicate, because שֶׁמֶשׁ is a feminine noun, whereas וַיְהִי is a masculine verb. Therefore, Rashi explains as follows:] This is similar to (below 42:35): “And it came to pass that they were emptying their sacks”; (II Kings 13:21): “And it came to pass that they were burying a man”; meaning: this event took place. [The subject of וַיְהִי is not הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ but דָבָר זֶה (i.e., it is as if the masculine noun דָבָר זֶה (this event) were inserted after וַיְהִי.] The same is true in the two instances quoted by Rashi, in which the subject is plural, whereas the predicate is singular. There too, the subject of וַיְהִי is דָבָר זֶה.]
the sun had set: Heb. בָּאָה. It had set.
and it was dark: The day darkened.
and behold, a smoldering furnace, etc.: He hinted to him that the kingdoms of the pagans would fall into hell. — [from Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, ch. 28]
had set: Heb. בָּאָה Its accent is on the first syllable. Therefore, it is explained that it had already set; but if its accent were at the end, on the “alef,” it would be explained to mean: as it was setting. but it is impossible to say this, for it is already written (above verse 12): “Now the sun was setting,” and the passing of the smoking furnace happened after this. It is found that it had already set. And this difference exists in every word in the feminine gender, whose radical consists of two letters, such as בא (to come), קם (to arise), שב (to return). When the accent is on the first syllable, it is in the past tense, e.g., this case and e.g., (below 29:9): “and Rachel came (בָּאָה)”; (below 37:7): “my sheaf arose (קָמָה)”; (Ruth 1:15): “Lo! Your sister-in-law has returned (שָׁבָה).” However, when the accent is on the final syllable, it is in the present tense, denoting a thing that is happening now and is continuing to happen, like (below 29:6): “She is coming בָּאָה with the flocks”; (Esther 2:14): “In the evening she would come (בָּאָה), and in the morning she would return (שָׁבָה).”

את הקיני THE KENITE — There are ten nations mentioned here but He gave them only the territory of seven nations (Deut. VII. 1); the other three, Edom, Moab and Ammon, — who are the Kenites, the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites — will only at some future time become Israel’s possession, as it is said, (Isa. XI. 14) “They shall put forth their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them” (Genesis Rabbah 44:23).

And [G-d] replies, "now is he a righteous person or a wicked person?" [The Angels] say, "he's a righteous person."

Many Days. This is more than those days in Hebron, [since] Hebron was 25 years and here it's 26 years. Since he was 75 when he left Haran, the same year (Genesis 13:18) "He came to sit in the tents of Mamre, that beforehand we don't find that he settles in any place other than that, that in every place he goes He was a guest who reside then leaves and goes. As it says (Genesis 12:6) "And Abram passed by," (Genesis 12:8) "And he moved from there," (Genesis 12:10) "And there was a great famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt." And in Egypt he was only there for three months until Pharaoh sent him away, from (Genesis 13:3) "and he went on his journey," until (13:8) "he came and sat at the tents of Mamre in Hebron." There he remained until the destruction of S'dom, [and] immediately [afterward] (Genesis 20:1) "And Moses travled from there because of Lot's embarrassment and came to the land of the Phillistines." And then he was 99 years old, that on the third day of his circumcision the angels came to him, that this was twenty five years and thus it is written "many days," [i.e.] more than the first set. And the text does not come to limit [the understanding] but to expand it -- and if you would increase [the years] to more than two or more [than the time he spent in Hebron], it would have been explained. But you don't need this [explatation] when you do not have more than a year, that is to say 26 years. Immediately afterward he'd go and return to Hebron, and it was the same year right before the Binding of Isaac [when he was] 12 years. Thus, it was taught in "Seder Olam" (Chapter 1).

Chapter 22



Verse 1

There are some Sages who say [that this event occurred] “After the words of Satan” who said accusingly [to God], “From all the feasts that Avraham prepared, he did not offer as sacrifice to You a single bull or ram.” He [God] responded to him, “He does everything for the sake of his son. Yet, if I were to say to him, ‘Sacrifice him to Me,’ he would not refuse.” There are those [other Sages] who say “After the words of Yishmael” who would boast to Yitzhak that he was circumcised when he was thirteen and did not resist. Yitzhak responded to him: “You try to intimidate me with one limb. If God would tell me, ‘Sacrifice yourself to Me,’ I would not refuse.”
This is the response of the pious— an expression of humility and readiness.

Verse 2

Na is an expression of a request. He [God] said to him, “I plead with you, withstand this test so that no one can say that the first [tests] were not real.”
He [Avraham] responded, “I have two sons.” He [God] said to him, “Your only one.” He responded, “This one is an only son to his mother and the other is an only son to his mother.” He [God] said to him, “Who you love.” “I love them both,” he [Avraham] answered. Then, He said, “Yitzhak!” Why didn’t God reveal this from the beginning? So as not to confuse him suddenly, and he become bewildered and deranged. And, also, so that he value the mitzvah and he would get the reward for each and every expression.
[This refers to] Jerusalem. As in II Chronicles 3:1, “To build the House of God in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah.” Our rabbis explained [that it is called this] because from there instruction (lit. “Torah”) goes forth to Israel. Onkelos’ translation is based on the incense service which contains myrrh, nard, and other spices.

And the life of Sarah was one hundred years and twenty years and seven years: The reason that the word “years” was written after every digit is to tell you that every digit is to be expounded upon individually: when she was one hundred years old, she was like a twenty-year-old regarding sin. Just as a twenty-year-old has not sinned, because she is not liable to punishment, so too when she was one hundred years old, she was without sin. And when she was twenty, she was like a seven-year-old as regards to beauty. — from Gen. Rabbah 58:1]
The years of the life of Sarah: All of them equally good.

For the scoffers of the generation said that Sarah became pregnant from Avimelech, for after all, she resided many years with Avraham and didn't become pregnant from him. What did the Hakadosh Baruch Hu do? He formed Yitzchak's visage to resemble that of Avraham, and so all testified "Avraham fathered Yitzchak". And this is what is written here, that Yitzchak was the son of Avraham, for there was testimony that Avraham fathered Yitzchak.

"And [he] left" — It was only necessary to write "And Jacob travelled to Charan", so why does it mention his departure? It tells us that the departure of a righteous person from a place makes a mark, because when a righteous person is in a city, he is its glory, he is its radiance, he is its beauty. When he leaves there, the glory departs, the radiance departs, the beauty departs. And similarly (in Ruth 1) "and she left from the place" which is said about Naomi and Ruth.
"And he travelled to Charan" — he left to travel to Charan.

I believe, however, that it is a term meaning that he attached himself, and it is an Aramaic expression [found in the Talmud] (Sanh. 63b):“After they became attached (דָּאִבִיקוּ) to it,”“and he would tie it (וְאָבִיק לֵיהּ מֵיבַק),” for so is the habit of two people who make strong efforts to throw each other down, that one embraces the other and attaches himself to him with his arms.

Reuben came and saw this as an insult to his mother.  He said, " If my mother's sister was my mother's rival, why then would the handmaid of my mother's sister, become my mother's rival?

For [saying that they] ate from a living animal, they slaughtered a goat when they sold him and did <i>not</i> eat it alive. For slandering them that they called their brothers slaves, he was sold as a slave and for the sexual slanders, his masters wife laid eyes on him etc.
