Rashi on Jeremiah



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah</b> Let the son of the corrupt woman, whose deeds are proper Jeremiah was descended from Rahab the harlot and let him reprove the son of the righteous woman whose deeds are corrupt these are Israel who corrupted their deeds who are descended from legitimate seed.

Verse 2

<b>To whom the word of the Lord came</b> Upon whom the Shechinah commenced to rest at that time.

Verse 3

<b>And he was in the days of Jehoiakim</b> And he was a prophet all the remaining days of Josiah, the days of his son Jehoiakim, and the days of his son Zedekiah, until the end of the eleventh year that is the year until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>When I had not yet formed you in the womb, etc.</b> Since the days of the first man. The Holy One, blessed be He, showed Adam each generation and its prophets.
<b>I...formed you</b> Heb. אצרך, an expression of צורה, a form.
<b>I knew you</b> connois toi in O.F. Comp. (Exodus 6:3), “I was not known (נודעתּי) to them.”
<b>I appointed you</b> I appointed you for this.
<b>a prophet to the nations</b> To Israel, who behave like the nations. In this manner it is expounded in Sifrei on the verse: “A prophet from your midst, etc.” (Deut. 18:15), will set up for you and not for those who deny the Torah. How then do I fulfill “A prophet to the nations I made you”? To the children of Israel who deport themselves with the customs of the nations. It can further be interpreted: “A prophet for the nations,” like “About the nations,” to give them to drink the cup of poison, to prophesy retribution upon them, as it is said: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand, you shall give all the nations to drink of it” (infra 25:15). Another explanation of “When you had not yet emerged from the womb I appointed you” is: Concerning you I said to Moses: “I will set up a prophet...like you” (Deut. 18:18). This one reproved them, and this one reproved them. This one prophesied for forty years and this one prophesied for forty years.

Verse 6

<b>Alas</b> This is an expression of wailing (konpljjnt in O.F.).
<b>for I am a youth</b> I am not worthy to reprove them. Moses reproved them shortly before his death, when he was already esteemed in their eyes through the many miracles that he had performed for them. He had taken them out of Egypt, split the Reed Sea for them, brought down the manna, caused the quails to fly, given them the Torah, brought up the well. I come to reprove them at the beginning of my mission.

Verse 7

<b>wherever I send you</b> to the heathens.
<b>and whatever I command you</b> to Israel, you shall speak.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>And the Lord stretched forth His hand</b> Every sending mentioned concerning a hand is an expression of stretching forth. Another explanation is like the Targum: And the Lord sent the words of His prophecy.

Verse 10

<b>I have appointed you</b> I have appointed you over the heathens.
<b>to uproot and to crush</b> (depayser in French, to uproot) and over Israel to build and to plant if they heed. So did Jonathan paraphrase it.

Verse 11

<b>a rod of an almond tree</b> (amendleer in O.F.) Jonathan, however, renders: A King who hastens to do evil.

Verse 12

<b>You have seen well</b> This almond tree hastens to blossom before all other trees. I, too, hasten to perform My word. And the Midrash Aggadah (Ecc. Rabbah 12:8) explains: An almond tree takes twenty-one days from its blossoming until it is completely ripe, as the number of days between the seventeenth of Tammuz, when the city was broken into, until the ninth of Ab, when the Temple was burnt.

Verse 13

<b>a bubbling pot</b> [lit. blown up,] seething (boillant in French).
<b>whose foam</b> [lit. and its face,] its seething (et ses ondes in O.F.) [and its waves].

Verse 14

<b>From the north the misfortune will break forth</b> Babylon is on the north of Eretz Israel.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>And I will utter My judgments against them</b> I will debate with them, with Judah and Jerusalem.

Verse 17

<b>And you shall gird your loins</b> This is an expression of quickening like a man of valor.

Verse 18

<b>against the Kings of Judah</b> lit. to the Kings of Judah.

Verse 19

<b>And they shall fight against you</b> They shall quarrel and fight against you to refute the words of your prophecy.

Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>I remember to you</b> Were you to return to Me, I would desire to have mercy on you for I remember the loving kindness of your youth and the love of the nuptials of your wedding canopy, when I brought you into the wedding canopy, and this (כלולתיך) is an expression of bringing in. Your nuptials (Noces in O.F.). Now what was the loving kindness of your youth? Your following My messengers, Moses and Aaron, from an inhabited land to the desert without provisions for the way since you believed in Me.

Verse 3

<b>Israel is holy</b> like terumah.
<b>the first of His grain</b> Like the first of the harvest before the Omer, which it is forbidden to eat, and whoever eats it is liable, so will all those who eat him be guilty. So did Jonathan render it.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>And they did not say, Where is the Lord</b> that we should follow other gods?
<b>plains</b> Heb. ערבה (planure in O.F.), related to pianoro in Old Italian, meaning ‘a plateau.’
<b>and pits</b> Heb. ושוחה (enfosses in O.F.), pitted.
<b>waste</b> Heb. ציה (degat in French).
<b>and darkness</b> Heb. וצלמות. An expression of darkness.

Verse 7

<b>to a forest land</b> To the land of Israel which is planted like כרמל, meaning: planted like a forest.

Verse 8

<b>and those who hold onto the Torah</b> The Sanhedrin.
<b>and the rulers</b> the kings.
<b>prophesied by Baal</b> In the name of Baal.

Verse 9

<b>Therefore, I will still contend</b> Before I bring misfortune upon you, I will still contend with you through My prophets, although I have already contended with you many days.

Verse 10

<b>the isles of the Kittites</b> To the isles of the Kittites.
איי is (isles in French).
<b>and send to Kedar</b> And send to Kedar to see their custom.
<b>and consider diligently</b> And put your heart to it to consider the matter diligently.
<b>whether</b> Heb. הן, like אם, if. Whether either of those nations exchanged its god although they are no gods, yet My nation exchanged their glory, with which they were honored. The Kittites and the Kedarites were tent dwellers and cattle herders, who would travel, go, and wander from pasture to pasture and from desert to desert, and they carry their gods with them to the place where they encamp. But I carried you until I established you, yet you forsook Me. This is how Jonathan paraphrased it. Our Sages said however: The Kittites worshipped water and the Kedarites worshipped fire. And although they know that water quenches fire, they did not forsake their god.

Verse 11

<b>for what does not avail</b> For an idol that does not avail.

Verse 12

<b>O heavens, be astonished</b> Heb. שמו, an expression of astonishment, like השתוממוּ. It is the imperative form, with the same vowel points as (I Sam. 14:9): “If they say thus to us, “Wait (דּמּוּ) .”
<b>and storm</b> Heb. ושערו, an expression of סער, a storm.
<b>become very desolate</b> As though you are becoming desolate because of the Temple that is destined to be destroyed.

Verse 13

<b>two evils</b> Had they exchanged their Deity [lit. their fear] for one His equal, it would be one evil, and now that they have forsaken Me, that I am a spring of living waters, to follow idols, which are like cisterns of stored up water, and they are broken and cracked, and their water is absorbed in their cracks, these are two evils.
<b>to dig</b> Heb. לחצב, lit. to hew.
<b>that do not hold</b> (Tendront in O.F.) their water, for the water will make their edge and their walls muddy, and they cave in.

Verse 14

<b>Is he a home born slave?</b> The son of a maidservant.

Verse 15

<b>roar</b> roar, a present tense.
<b>young lions</b> Symbolic of kings.
<b>were burnt</b> were burnt with fire.

Verse 16

<b>Also the children of Noph and Tahpanhes</b> They are the Egyptians upon whom you trust for aid.
<b>will break your crown</b> They will break your skull. ירעוּך is an expression of breaking (רציצה), as we translate ורצוץ, “and crushed” (Deut. 28:33), וּרעיע.

Verse 17

<b>Is not this caused to you</b> Is not this misfortune and this retribution caused to you by the guilt and the iniquity that you have forsaken the Lord your God?
<b>at the time He leads you by the way</b> For He would teach you the good and the straight way.

Verse 18

<b>what have you to do in the way of Egypt</b> Why do you leave Me and trust in Egypt?
<b>to drink the water of the Shihor</b> For they drowned your male children in the Nile. Shihor is the Nile, as it is said: “From the Shihor which is before Egypt,” in the Book of Joshua (13:3).
<b>and what have you to do</b> to rebel against Me so that you should be exiled to the way of Assyria, to the other side of the Euphrates River?

Verse 19

<b>Your evil will chastise you</b> Eventually, your evil will bring suffering upon you.
<b>and your backslidings</b>, Heb. ומשבותיך, an expression related to “backsliding children (שובבים)” (infra 3:22).
<b>will reprove you</b> Heb. תוכחך, an expression of reproof.
<b>and the fear of Me was not</b> My fear was not in your heart that you should fear Me.

Verse 20

<b>I broke your yoke</b> To the wooden yoke an expression of breaking applies, and to the yoke-bands which are of leather an expression of tearing open applies.
<b>yoke-bands</b> [מוסרותיך are the] ropes used to shackle the yoke [to the animal].
<b>and you said, “I will not transgress.”</b> your words.
<b>but on every lofty hill</b> Put you did not keep your promise, for on every lofty hill you recline (צעה). This is an expression of a bed and a sheet (מצע). [The word] כי serves as an expression of ‘but.’

Verse 21

<b>I planted you a noble vine stock</b> Heb. שורק is the branches of a good vine, that is to say the children of pious and righteous fathers. Its midrashic interpretation is: I planted you שורק. I added for you to the seven commandments of the children of Noah, six hundred and six, as is the numerical value of שורק.
<b>degenerate</b> Heb. סוּרי (Destoultours in O.F).
<b>wild vine</b> that grows in the forests.

Verse 22

<b>with natron</b> A type of earth with which garments are cleansed and rubbed.
<b>soap</b> Heb. בֹּרִית, cleanliness. Comp. “And pure (וּבַר) of heart” (Ps. 24:4). Some explain בֹּרִית as savon in French, soap.
<b>your iniquity is stained</b> Jon. renders: Like the mark of a stain that is unclean, so have your sins increased before Me. 
כתם is tka in O.F.
<b>your iniquity</b> This is said concerning the iniquity of the ‘Golden Calf,’ which remains in existence forever, as it is stated: “And on the day of My visitation, I will visit upon them their sin” (Exodus 32:34). All visitations that come upon Israel have part of the iniquity of the Golden Calf in them.

Verse 23

<b>See your way in the valley</b> See what you have done opposite Beth-Peor, and until now you adhere to that way like a swift she camel clinging to her ways.
<b>young she-camel</b> Heb. בכרה, a young female camel, that loves to wander. “The young camels (בכרי) of Midian” (Isa. 60:6) is translated “and they are young camels,” as we find in Sanhedrin 52a: There are many old camels laden with the skins of young camels (הוגני).
<b>clinging</b> Adhering to the ways of her youth, an expression similar to: “it would have clung (מסריך סריך)” (Chullin 51a). This may be associated with “a shoe thong (שרוך נעל)” (Gen. 14:23). She binds the ways of her youth in her heart.

Verse 24

<b>A wild donkey</b> (salvatico in O.F.) wild, and some interpret it as poulain in O.F., a foal.
<b>accustomed to the desert</b> Accustomed to be in the deserts, so she loves to wander.
<b>that snuffs up the wind</b> She opens her mouth and snuffs up the wind, and he always returns to his place.
<b>her tendency like the sea creatures, who can hinder her?</b> That trait of the sea creatures that she has, for also the sea creature snuffs up the wind, as it is said: “They snuff up the wind like sea creatures” (infra 14:6). Who can hinder her from that trait? So it is with you who can return you from your evil way? <b>her tendency like a sea creature</b> Son dagronemant in O.F., dragon nature. Jonathan rendered it in this manner, כערודה. Another explanation: It is an expression of wailing, comp. “moaning and wailing”. 
<b>all who seek her will not weary</b> For they will weary needlessly, for they will be unable to overtake her. What will her end be? In her month, they will find her. There is one month in the year that she sleeps for the whole month, and then she is captured. You, too, - one month (viz. Ab) was already prepared for you from the days of the spies, when your forefathers established it as a time of vain weeping, therein, you will be captured. (תּאניה ואניה) (Lam. 2:5). Another explanation: (sa contree in French,) her country, comp. Taanath Shiloh (Josh. 16:6).

Verse 25

<b>Withhold your foot from going barefoot</b> This your habit, like the wild donkey that loves to wander. My prophets say to you, “Withhold your foot from idolatry lest you go barefoot into exile and withhold your throat from dying of thirst.” <b>but you said</b> concerning the words of the prophets. <b>I despair</b> It is of no concern. I despair of your words. נואש is (nonkalajjr in O.F.) nonchalair in modern French.

Verse 26

<b>when he is found out</b> At the beginning, when he is found to be a thief, and he was presumed to be faithful. In this manner, Jonathan rendered it.

Verse 27

<b>and at the time of their misfortune they say</b> i.e., they say to Me, “Arise and save us.” Jonathan, too, translates in this manner: And at the time that misfortune befalls them, they deny their idols and confess before Me, and say. “Have mercy upon us and save us.”

Verse 28

<b>as many as your cities were your gods</b> In every city was another god.

Verse 29

<b>Why do you contend</b> How do you come to contend with the quarrel and say, “We do not sin”?
<b>All of you have rebelled against Me</b> Even the righteous are meant. This is what people say, “With the thorn the cabbage suffers.”

Verse 30

<b>In vain have I smitten</b> For no purpose, for it did not avail that they should receive correction.
<b>Your sword devoured</b> your prophets, Zechariah and Isaiah.

Verse 31

<b>See the word of the Lord</b> He took out to them the jar of manna. He said to them, “See here how helpful the word of the Lord is.” <b>was I a desert to Israel</b> Heb. המדבר. This is the interrogative form. Therefore, the ‘mem’ is punctuated ‘weak,’ i.e., without a ‘dagesh’ and the ‘heh’ with a ‘hataph- pattah.’ Did it seem to your forefathers that it was a desert when they traversed it? For I brought down for them this bread, the necessity of each day in its day.
<b>thick darkness</b> מאפליה, an expression of darkness.
<b>Why have My people said, “We have been separated...”?</b> Heb. רדנו, we have been separated from You. Like one who separates (רודֶה) bread from the oven. So is the midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (Bamidbar 2). Menahem, however, explains רדנוּ as an expression of descending (ירידה) and also in other manners (Machbereth Menahem, p. 162).

Verse 32



Verse 33

<b>How you adorn</b> Heb. תיטבי. You adorn yourself to greet your adulterers. Comp. “And she adorned her head” (I Kings 9:30) concerning Jezebel in the section dealing with Jehu.
<b>even to the most evil you accustomed</b> You searched throughout all the evil ways to learn the most corrupt of them all. גם is an expression of ‘even.’
<b>verily</b> Heb. לכן, an expression of a true oath. Verily, to the most evil way of all the ways you accustomed yourself.
<b>you accustomed</b> Heb. למדת, lit. you taught.

Verse 34

<b>you did not find them breaking in</b> You did not find them breaking in when you slew them.
<b>you did not find them</b> So does Scripture say for a feminine second person singular, and there are many such examples in the Book of Ezekiel (16:58), “You bore them (נשאתים).”
<b>but for all these</b> i.e., because they were reproving you for all these things.

Verse 35

<b>And you said</b> i.e., you said in your heart.
<b>But I am innocent</b> That I have purified my soul.
<b>I contend with you</b> I will come with you in judgment.

Verse 36

<b>degrade yourself</b> Heb. תזלי, an expression of degradation.
<b>to change your way</b> To leave Me and to rely on Egypt for aid in the days of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah (infra 37).
<b>to change</b> Heb. לשנות, an expression of change.
<b>as you were ashamed through Assyria</b> Upon whom Ahaz relied and “he oppressed him and did not strengthen him” (II Chron. 28:20).

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>to say</b> I have to say that you are no longer fit for me, for so is the way of one who sends away his wife and she goes away, etc.
<b>But you have played the harlot [with] many lovers</b> With many lovers. Nevertheless, return to Me.
<b>yet return to me</b> Heb. ושוב, lit. and to return to me, like עשות, to do, and to return to Me, I long for you.

Verse 2

<b>rivulets</b> rivulets of water.
<b>you were not lain with</b> Heb. שלגת, an expression of a פילגש a concubine.
<b>you sat for them</b> to be prepared to greet them.
<b>like an Arab</b> A tent dweller, who is always found outside in the deserts, and because of this, he is called ערבי since he dwells in the ערבה, the plain.

Verse 3

<b>and the latter rain</b> The rain that falls in Nissan on the ears (מלילות) and the straws (קשים). מלקוש is (tardif in O.F.).

Verse 4

<b>Will you not from now</b> If only you repent of your evil and call me “My Father.” If you do so, will your Lord bear a grudge forever for what you have sinned? Will He keep it to eternity? He will not keep it.

Verse 5

<b>Behold, you have spoken</b> with your mouth, “We will no longer come to You,” and that evil you will do, and you will not give any thought of returning.
<b>and you were able</b> And you prevailed in rebelling with a victorious and irrefutable reply.

Verse 6

<b>In the days of King Josiah</b> when He commanded me to bring back the Ten Tribes, “Have you seen what the backsliding Israel has done? משבה is the same as שובבה, (envejjsede in O.F).
<b>Israel</b> The Ten Tribes.
<b>she goes</b> i.e., when she was still on her land before she was exiled in the days of Hezekiah with Hoshea son of Elah.
הלכה means, she would go on every lofty mountain.
<b>and she played the harlot there</b> i.e., she played the harlot by worshipping idols. וַתִּזְנִי is the equivalent of וַתִּזֶן, the ‘yod’ being superfluous.

Verse 7

<b>And I said</b> through My prophets, Amos and Hosea son of Beeri and the other prophets, “You shall return to Me.”
<b>And her treacherous sister Judah saw it</b> i.e., saw all this. The appellation “treacherous” is harsher than “backsliding.” Israel, since they were the first to sin, and they did not see any retribution from which to learn and to repent, are called “backsliding.” Judah, who saw that these went in exile and did not receive correction, are called “treacherous.”

Verse 8

<b>And I saw, because of all that backsliding Israel had committed adultery</b> The signs of the intonation of this verse teach us its explanation. ישראל is punctuated with a ‘zakef-katan,’ separated from שלחתיה, I sent her away. שלחתיה, I sent her away, is punctuated with a ‘zakef-gadol’ by itself. And this is its explanation: I saw; i.e., I contemplated her to exact punishment upon her. And why? Because of all that backsliding Israel had committed adultery. And what was My vengeance? I sent her away from before Me. And treacherous Judah did not fear when she saw the retribution of Samaria, to set her heart to repent.

Verse 9

<b>and she committed adultery with the stones</b> Jonathan paraphrases: And she strayed with the worshippers of stones and wood. And Jonathan renders מִקֹל as an expression of lightness, since her idols were light in her eyes.

Verse 10

<b>And yet for all this</b> that they saw the misfortune of the retribution of their companions.
<b>but falsely</b> Josiah’s generation would show themselves as righteous although they were wicked. They would make forms of pagan deities on the inside of their doors, half on this door and half on this one, and when the destroyers of idols would inspect, the door would be open, and they would not notice it.

Verse 11

<b>has proved herself more righteous</b> She has been cleared and she has freed herself from an unfavorable verdict, for she had no one to learn from.

Verse 12

<b>Go and proclaim, etc.</b> Go, as the Targum renders, אזיל, the imperative form. Here he commanded him to go and bring back the Ten Tribes during the days of Josiah, as he states above that during the days of Josiah this prophecy was said to him and some of them returned in the eighteenth year of Josiah.
<b>to the north</b> To the places where they were exiled there to Assyria.
<b>My anger</b> My anger, so did Jonathan render it.

Verse 13

<b>you have rebelled</b> Heb. פשעת.
<b>and you have scattered your ways</b> This is an expression of harlotry, spreading the legs to the woman’s private parts.

Verse 14

<b>backsliding children</b> (Envasec in O.F.) That you perverted your way because of much good, that you enjoyed tranquility and pleasure, as Scripture states: They hum snatches of song to the tune of the lute (Amos 6:5), those who drink from bowls of wine (v. 6).
<b>for I possessed you</b> and you are called by My name, that I am your Master, and it is not honorable for Me to leave you in the hands of My enemies.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>they will no longer say, “The ark of the Lord’s covenant”</b> For your entire assembly will be holy, and I will dwell therein as though it were an ark.
<b>nor shall they remember it</b> Heb. יפקדו, like יזכרוּ, remember or mention.
<b>nor shall it be done anymore</b> i.e., it shall not be done what was done with it already in Shiloh, that they brought it into the battle with the Philistines in the days of Eli.

Verse 17

<b>shall gather</b> Heb. ונקוו, an expression of: מקוה מים, a gathering of water.
<b>the idea of</b> an expression of seeing. Comp. אשורנו “I see him” (Num. 24:17).

Verse 18

<b>the house of Judah will go with the house of Israel</b> They will join them and they will be added to them to be one kingdom.

Verse 19

<b>And I said</b> to Myself, etc. and therefore, I caused your forefathers to inherit them.
<b>How shall I place you among the sons?</b> i.e., how shall I place you, my congregation and My nation, among the other sons, mingled with the heathens. I, therefore, selected a handsome portion, and I gave you a desirable land.
<b>the beauty of hosts of nations</b> The beauty of all the hosts of nations.

Verse 20

<b>Truly</b> But you did not live up to My expectations [lit., do My thought], but like a woman who betrays her beloved because he cannot provide her sustenance, so did you betray Me, Who provides you with all good. So is the Midrash Aggadah (Tanhuma Mishpatim 17).

Verse 21

<b>A voice on the rivulets is heard</b> It is likely to be heard.

Verse 22

<b>Here we are, we have come to You</b> The prophet teaches them to confess and to say as follows, “Here we are, we have come to You... Truly, in vain... But the shameful thing has consumed, etc., Let us lie in our shame.” All this is the language of the prayer that the prophet teaches them to say. 
We have come אתנו.

Verse 23

<b>Truly, in vain</b> we awaited from the hills and the multitude of mountains where we worshipped idols.
<b>Truly</b> in truth.

Verse 24

<b>But the shameful thing</b> The idolatry with which we occupied ourselves, as Scripture states. “And they turned aside to the shameful thing” (Hosea 9:10).
<b>consumed the toil of our fathers</b> Because of the iniquity of its worship, our toil was pillaged.

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<b>If you return, O Israel</b> with this repentance, to Me, you will return to your original glory and greatness.
<b>and if you remove your detestable things from My Presence</b> Then you shall not wander to go out in exile.

Verse 2

<b>And you will swear, “As the Lord lives,” in truth</b> When you swear by My name, you will swear in truth, not as now, that it is written concerning you, “And if they say, ‘As the Lord lives,’ surely they swear falsely” (5:2).
<b>nations will bless themselves with him</b> If you do so, then nations will bless themselves with Israel. Every non-Jew will say to his son, “You shall be like So-and-so the Jew.”
<b>boast</b> Heb. יתהללו, they will recite your praise. Another explanation of is יתהללו: Whoever is able to cleave to Israel will boast about the matter (porvanter in French).

Verse 3

<b>For so said the Lord, etc. Plow for yourself a furrow</b> Learn from the tillers of the soil, who plow it in the summer to kill the roots of the grasses, that it should not grow thorns at the time of sowing in the winter. You, too, improve your deeds before the evil befalls you, so that your prayer should not be rejected when you cry out.
<b>and do not sow upon thorns</b> And let not your cry before Me be from amidst wickedness, but from amidst repentance, that you shall not resemble one sowing without plowing, and that turns into thorns (kardons in O.F., chardons in modern French).

Verse 4

<b>Circumcise yourselves to the Lord</b> Before My anger comes forth like fire. This is like plowing before the sowing.

Verse 5

<b>and say, “Sound a shophar...”</b> Warn the inhabitants of the land that they sound the shophar to flee.
<b>assemble</b> Heb. מלאו. An expression of gathering, and there are many in the Scriptures: (Isaiah 31: 4) “Although a band of (מְלֹא) shepherds gather against him,” Also (infra 12:6) “They called after you a band (מָלֵא).” Also (Job 16:10) “Together they gather (יתמלאוּן) against me.”

Verse 6

<b>Raise a standard</b> to flee to Zion.
<b>assemble</b> Heb. העיזו. Comp. “Send, gather (העז)” (Exodus 9:19).

Verse 7

<b>A lion has come up</b> That is Nebuchadnezzar.
<b>from his thicket</b> It is customary for a lion to lie in wait in the thickets of the forest (espaises in O.F.).
<b>will be desolate</b> Heb. תצינה, an expression of desolation.

Verse 8

<b>Because of this</b> What is “this?” “For the fierce anger etc.” Although he spoke above concerning Nebuchadnezzar in regards to the destruction, here he returns to speak of the death of Josiah.
<b>for the fierce anger of the Lord etc.</b> Although Josiah repented wholeheartedly, it is stated concerning him. (II Kings 23:26)... “the Lord did not turn back from his great wrath...because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked Him.”

Verse 9

<b>And it shall be on that day</b> On the day of Josiah they will wonder why so much befell him, for they do not know that his generation did not repent properly. When he came to abolish idolatry, what did the scorners of the generation do? They would engrave an image of a pagan deity on their doors, half of it on this door and half of it on this door. When he would open it, it was not discernible, and when he went away from there, he would close it, and it would join together.

Verse 10

<b>Surely You have misled</b> Heb. השא השאת (fa)tenter in O.F.), tempting, an expression like (Gen. 3: 13) “The serpent misled me (השיאני),” for the false prophets prophesy for them, You will have peace.

Verse 11

<b>of this people</b> Concerning this people when they are all exiled.
<b>has swept the rivulets</b> It sweeps even the fields with rivulets of water to make them into a desert. Another explanation: צח is an expression of thirst, which is translated צחותא.
<b>[on] the way of the daughter of My people</b> That wind will come, and also, not to winnow the chaff from the threshing floor ([a]vanner in O.F.). Comp. (infra 15:7) “And I winnowed them with a sieve (ואזרם במזרה).”
<b>and not to cleanse</b> And not to cleanse grain does it come. That is to say, not for good but for evil, to exile men [women], and children, and livestock.

Verse 12

<b>A full spirit</b> of these retributions shall come to me. <b>A full spirit</b> A full spirit, that I will not retract and not repent. <b>spirit</b> (talant in O.F.)
<b>debate</b> Heb. משפטים, an expression of debating.

Verse 13

<b>and like the whirlwind</b> (comme tourbillon in O.F.)

Verse 14

<b>your iniquitous thoughts</b> Your injustice.

Verse 15

<b>For a voice proclaims from Dan</b> Jonathan paraphrases: “Behold the voice of the prophets prophesy about them that they will be exiled because they worshipped the calf that was in Dan, and people bringing bad tidings will come upon them because they subordinated themselves to the image that Micah erected on the mountain of the house of Ephraim.” Although the calves had already been exiled since the days of Sennacherib, their iniquity was still existing. Sin is harsh, for it destroys [lit. breaks] before it and after it; before it, since the days of Abraham, as it is stated (Gen. 14:14): “And he pursued until Dan.” As soon as he reached Dan, he grew faint [lit. his strength was weakened], for his children would, in the future, worship idols there, and after it, in the destruction of the Temple, as it is stated: “A voice proclaims from Dan.”
<b>and announces calamity</b> Heb. און, a breach.

Verse 16

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>and behold, the fruitful field</b> The land, planted with all good like a forest, has become like a desert. The Midrash Aggadah states: “I saw the mountains”These are the Patriarchs. “And all the hills”These are the Matriarchs. That is to say that their merit was depleted. “There were no people”This refers to Moses, about whom it is said: “humbler than all the people” (Num. 12:3). “And behold the Karmel”This is Elijah.

<b>shall be torn to pieces</b> by Edom.
<b>a wolf of the deserts</b> Heb. ערבות, an expression of (supra 2:6) ערבה ושוחה “plains and pits,” a wolf of the desert.
<b>hastens</b> Heb. שקד. Menahem (p. 180) associates it with an expression of watching. Comp. (Prov. 8:34) “To watch (לשקוד) My doors daily.” And Jonathan rendered it as an expression of lying in wait.

Verse 7

<b>Shall I forgive you for this?</b> This is the rhetorical question, Shall I forgive you for this? And Menahem (p. 22) explains אי like אין, not. For this I will not forgive you, because your children have forsaken Me, when I sated them with all good.
<b>they banded together</b> They gather in troops.

Verse 8

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>Ascend upon its rows</b> Heb. בשרותיה, an expression of a plain. Menahem (p. 181) associates it as an expression of a wall with (II Sam. 22:30) “I scale a wall (שור),” but נטישותיה (cep in Prov.) do not fit for they are the roots of the vineyard to be associated either with the walls or with the plain. I say, therefore, that בשרותיה is an expression of the rows of the vineyard. Jonathan, however, rendered בשרותיה, in her cities, and נטישותיה, her palaces.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>And [they] said, “It is not He”</b> [The Targum renders:] Our good fortune does not come before Him.

Verse 13

<b>And the prophets shall become wind</b> As the Targum renders: And the false prophets shall become naught. That is to say, the prophecy that the false prophets prophesy for us in the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, their words shall turn to futility, and the speech of holiness that they say to us in the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is not in them.
<b>So shall be done to them</b> The prophet says to those who say this, “So shall be done to them as the Lord said to me, and what did the Lord say to me? “Because you have spoken this word, etc.”

Verse 14

<b>and it shall consume them</b> Heb. ואכלתם.

Verse 15

<b>It is an ancient nation</b> From days of yore it began to rebel against Me, in the generation of separation in the land of Shinar.

<b>the weeks of the laws of harvest</b> Seven weeks in which He ordained two ordinances of harvest, the ordinance of the omer, and the ordinance of the two breads.
<b>He keeps for us</b> that the harvest should be in its time.

Verse 25

<b>have brought about these</b> Have brought about these laws. Have cast aside these laws from you, so they don’t guard you and you will be consumed from hunger.

Verse 26

<b>they lie in wait</b> Heb. ישור. Comp. למען שוררי because of those who lie in wait for me (Psalms 27: 11), an expression of “I see him (אשורנו) but not near” (Num. 24:17).

<b>they station</b> Heb. יציבו, like “the garrison (מצב) of the Philistines” (I Sam. 14:4).

Verse 27

<b>As a cage</b> That is a place where they fatten fowl, and so does Jonathan render it, like a fattening place, and in O.F. (frank).

Verse 28

<b>they transgressed in deeds of wickedness</b> If evil or a sin came into their hand, they did not turn away from it, but transgressed it and committed it.
<b>they did not plead the cause of the orphan</b> in order that they prosper.

Verse 29



Verse 30

<b>An appalling...thing</b> Heb. שמה, a wonder.
<b>and horrible thing</b> Heb. ושערורה, a disgraceful thing to all, and what is the appalling thing? The prophets prophesy falsely and say, “Rob and plunder,” and the priests, who are the judges of the people and their overseers, govern the people on the hands of the prophets, that is to say, after them. Comp. (II Sam. 15) “And the king was crossing and all the people were crossing on his hand,” stated concerning David, meaning ‘after him.’ Here too, “on their hands” means ‘after them,’ to do according to the words of the prophets.

Chapter 6



Verse 1

<b>Gather the sons of Benjamin</b> to go to their cities to guard their fortifications.
<b>Beth-hakerem</b> That is a place name.
<b>raise a standard</b> a standard to gather and fight for your lives.

Verse 2

<b>The comely and the delicate one have I destroyed</b> Heb. דמיתי. Jonathan renders it as an expression related to (25:37) “And the dwellings of peace shall be destroyed (ונדמוּ).” Also (47:5), “Ashkelon has been destroyed (נדמתה).”

Verse 3

<b>Shepherds and their flocks</b> Figurative of kings and their armies.

<b>for the day has declined</b> When it declined to eventide, they ignited the Temple.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>Cut the trees</b> Heb. עצה. This is not a ‘mappiq heh,’ yet it is an expression of a tree (עץ), for the expression of cutting is not appropriate for advice, (עצה), and עצה mentioned here is an expression of many trees, as דגה is an expression of many fish.
<b>the city whose sins have been visited upon her</b> Heb. הפקד, whose visitation has come.

Verse 7

<b>As...lets...flow</b> Heb. כהקיר, an expression of a spring.
<b>a well</b> Heb. בַּיִר, equivalent to בְּאֵר.

<b>sickness and wounds</b> Therefore, I brought upon her sickness and wounds.

Verse 8

<b>Be corrected</b> Heb. הוסרי. Accept correction.
<b>lest...be alienated</b> Heb. תקע, lest it be pulled away. יקע is an expression of joining. Comp. “and hang them up (והוקע)” (Num. 25:4), and it is sometimes an expression of detaching. There are many words that are used in such a manner.

Verse 9

<b>thoroughly glean</b> (grappiller in French). After the vineyard has been gathered, and gleanings are left, and the poor come and glean them, so will they spoil and return and spoil.
<b>return your hand</b> You, the enemy, return your hand to spoil a second time, like a vintager who returns his hand for the search, who looks and searches for the gleanings. And so it was when he exiled Jehoiakim and slew him, and crowned Jeconiah, he returned three months later and exiled him. He returned eleven years later and exiled Zedekiah.
<b>the branches</b> Heb. סלסלות (reverchedures in O.F). Comp. (Prov. 4: 8) “Search for it (סלסלה) and it will exalt you.” So did Dunash (Teshuvoth Dunash p. 21) explain it. Menahem (Machbereth p. 126), however, explains it as an expression of a basket (סל) (paniers in O. F. baskets).

Verse 10

<b>and warn</b> Heb. ואעידה, an expression of warning.
<b>clogged</b> Heb. ערלה, clogged, and so is every expression of ערלה.

<b>to feel disgrace</b> Heb. הכלים, like להכלים.
<b>Neither are they ashamed</b> They are not ashamed of their evil deeds.

Verse 16

<b>rest</b> Heb. מרגוע.

Verse 17

<b>And I have stationed lookouts over you</b> That is that they station men on the towers at the time of strife. A man looks and sees. If a troop is approaching the city he sounds a shophar and warns the people to arm and to come on the wall. I too appointed prophets who inform you about the impending retribution to alert yourselves and to mend your ways so that you be saved and that is like the shophar sounded by the lookout. Hearken to the sound of this shophar and arm yourselves.
<b>And I have stationed</b> Heb. והקמותי. This means: I have already stationed for them. And so did Jonathan render: ואקימית, and I stationed. <b>lookouts</b> (Badetes in O.F.).

Verse 18

<b>what is within them</b> i.e., the evil that is in their hands.

Verse 19

<b>the fruit of their thoughts</b> the retribution for their thoughts.
<b>and they rejected My instruction</b> Heb. ותורתי וימאסו בה. This follows the pattern of (Exodus 15:2) “The strength and destruction of God was my salvation (ויהי לי לישועה),” for he should have said: והיה לי לישועה. So too, here it should have said, ותורתי מאסו בה, but it is the style of Scripture to speak in this manner.

Verse 20

<b>Why do I need frankincense</b> that you offer up to Me, that comes from Sheba?
<b>are not pleasant</b> Heb. ערבוּ.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>They will grasp</b> Heb. יחזיקו, they will take. Comp. (Exodus 4:4) “And he stretched out his hand and took it (ויחזק).” Comp. also (infra verse 24) “trouble grasped us (החזיקתנוּ) held us.”

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>there is fear</b> Heb. מגור. Another explanation: An expression of gathering. Comp. (Ezekiel 21: 17) “Gathered (מגורי) to the sword.” And in this manner Jonathan renders it.

Verse 26

<b>and roll</b> Heb. והתפלשי.
<b>a mourning [as] for an only child</b> A mourning for an only son; one who has only one son and he dies.
<b>a bitter lamentation</b> Heb. מספד תמרורים. Since it is the construct state, it is vowelized מספד with a ‘pattah,’ and it is not vowelized מספד with a ‘tzere.’
<b>upon us</b> So to speak, upon Me and upon you.

Verse 27

<b>I have made you the strong one</b> This was said to Jeremiah. I have made you the strong one in their midst, and you shall know and test their way, that he tested them and they will not heed. בחון is an expression of strength. Comp. (Isa. 32:14) “rampart and tower (בחן),” also (ibid. 23:13) “they erected its towers (בחוניו).”

Verse 28

<b>extremely perverse</b> Turning away from the road.
<b>going tale bearing</b> between copper and iron. They introduce hatred between two princes who have the power to provoke one another. That is what I heard. But I say, they are tale bearers, and they are as strong as copper and iron to maintain their falsehood. Jonathan, however, renders this word רכיל as an expression of guile (נוכל). They go with guile as one mixes copper with iron. נוכל is an expression of plot. Comp. (Gen. 37:18) “And they plotted (ויתנכלו) against him to slay him.”

Verse 29

<b>The bellows is heated</b> This is an allegory. When they refine silver, they blow with a bellows, and they always put lead into the crucible, which helps for the refining. But you—I have come to refine you. The bellows is heated and parched because of the fire, and the lead is completely consumed. נחר is an expression related to (Job 42:7) “My wrath has been kindled (חרה)”; (ibid. 30:30) “And my bones are burned (חרה) with heat,” (esrast in O.F.).
<b>in vain</b> In vain does the founder refine, for it is of no avail
<b>and the wicked ones have not been separated</b> from their evil way. That is to say that the prophets toiled to reprove, but it did not avail them.
<b>Separated</b> Heb. נתקו, (furent de... in O.F.). (Another version:) and the wicked ones. This is like רשעים.

Verse 30

<b>Refuse silver</b> which cannot be refined with any toil.

Verse 18

<b>star-shaped cakes</b> Heb. כַּוָנִים, the shape of a star.
<b>to the queen of heaven</b> The largest star they would call מלכת השמים, an expression of a queen, (מלכּה), and so did Jonathan render it: לכוכבת שמיא, to the female star of heaven.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>reaches</b> Heb. נתכת, falls and reaches. Comp. (Exodus 9:33) “and rain did not reach (נתּך) the earth”; did not reach.

Verse 21

<b>your burnt offerings</b> that you offer up completely it would be better for you to add them to your peace-offerings and sacrifice them as peace-offerings and eat the flesh, for they are not acceptable before Me. Why, then, should you lose them?

Verse 22

<b>on the day I brought them forth</b> The beginning of the condition was only (Exodus 19:5): “If you hearken to My voice and keep My covenant, you shall be a peculiar treasure to Me.”

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>in the view</b> Heb. בשררות, in the view of their heart, an expression related to (Num. 24:17) “I see him אשורנו.”

Verse 25

<b>sending them day [after day] every fresh morn</b> Every day sending them early.

Verse 26



Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29

<b>So tear off your diadem</b> Heb. גזי נזרך, tear out your hair. Comp. (Num. 11:31) “And He caused quails to fly (ויגז)”; also (Job 1:20), “And he shaved (ויגז) his head.” Another explanation is that נזרך means ‘your diadem,’ an expression of greatness, and so did Jonathan render: רברביך your great ones, and so did Menahem classify it (p. 83).
<b>and abandoned</b> Heb. ויטש.

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b>the high places of Topheth</b> That is Molech, which was of copper, and they would heat it up from underneath it with its hands spread out and heated. And they would place the child on his hands, and he would be burnt and moan, and the priests would beat drums so that the father should not hear his son’s voice and take pity. It is called Topheth because of the drum (תּוף), Hinnom because of the child’s moaning (נהמת).
<b>Hinnom</b> Because of the child’s moaning.
<b>which I did not ordain</b> with commandments that they offer up their children as sacrifices, and I did not speak to any of the prophets, and when I did speak to Abraham to slaughter his son, it did not enter My mind that he slaughter, but only to make his righteousness known.

Verse 32



Verse 33

<b>and no one will frighten them</b> i.e., no one will frighten the fowl from the carcasses.

Chapter 8



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>And spread them before the sun</b> And the Chaldeans shall dwell when they besiege the city, in the graves of the princes, that were as beautiful as palaces.
<b>for dung</b> For fertilizer.

Verse 3

<b>And death shall be preferable to life</b> Although they see the dead being subjected to disgrace, the distress of the living is worse than that, and they will choose death.

Verse 4

<b>Shall they fall and not rise</b> Is it good for them to cast themselves into a fall from which there is no rising?
<b>if he repents, will He not return?</b> If they wish to repent of their wickedness, will the Holy One, blessed be He, not return from His decree? Another explanation: If they repent, the repentance will not be permanent, for they will quickly return to their wickedness, and in this manner Jonathan rendered it: If to repent, it is revealed before Me that they will not repent.

Verse 5

<b>a perpetual backsliding</b> Heb. משבה נצחת, a perpetual backsliding, like נצח, perpetual.
<b>They have held</b> Heb. החזיקו.
<b>to deceit</b> Heb. בתרמית.

Verse 6

<b>Even the stork</b> (Cigogne in French).
<b>her seasons</b> The time they pass to the islands of the sea because of the cold, and the time of their return.
<b>await</b> Heb. שמרו.
<b>and the turtledove and the crane and the swallow</b> Jonathan renders: ושפנינא וכורכיא וּסנוּניתא. כּורכיא is (grue in French), a crane. סנוּניתא is (hirondelle in French), a swallow.

Verse 8

<b>Verily, behold it is in vain</b> Behold your wisdom is in vain within you to heal you lightly.
<b>he made a false scribes’ pen</b> i.e., your prophet.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>And they healed</b> Heb. וירפו, similar to וירפאו.

Verse 12

<b>They shall be put to shame</b> Shame and embarrassment shall come upon them.
<b>Neither are they ashamed</b> They are not ashamed of their evil deeds to take heart to repent.

Verse 13

<b>I will utterly consume them</b> This is an expression of destruction. Comp. (Zeph. 1:2) “I will utterly consume (אסף אסף) everything from upon the face of the earth.”
<b>There shall be no grapes on the vine</b> Nothing will be left over.
<b>even the leaves will be withered</b> Heb. נבל, an expression of withering (fleirit in French). Comp. (Isa. 34:4) “and as a withered fig (וּכנבלת) from a fig tree.” Also (ibid. 1:30), “like an elm whose leaves are wilting (נבלת).”
<b>for what I gave them they transgressed</b> All this shall befall them because I gave them statutes and they transgressed them.

Verse 14

<b>and there let us sit in silence</b> And let us be silent there. Let us sit there silent and mournful.
<b>poisoned water</b> Jonathan renders: the cup of the curse, like the venom of serpents. The venom of the serpents is the poison that is in his teeth.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>From Dan is heard</b> Because they worshipped the calf that was in Dan.
<b>the snorting of their horses</b> The sneezing of his nostrils.
<b>the neighing of their stallions</b> The neighing of joy of his horses, and we find elsewhere that horses are called אבּירים (Jud. 5:22) by reason of the prancings, “the prancings of their mighty ones (אבּיריו),” an expression of (Nahum 3:2) “a prancing horse.” And Jonathan renders: from the sound of the steps of their mighty ones.

Verse 17

<b>serpents, adders</b> After seventy years, the snake becomes a צפע, which shuts its ear so that it will not hear the voice of the charmer who charms him, as it is stated (Psalms 58:5), “Like a deaf asp that shuts up its ear.” That is the meaning of “that cannot be charmed.”

Verse 18

<b>Were I to suppress my grief</b> Heb. מבליגיתי, my suppression, and it is a noun, (mes estenimenc in O.F.). That is to say, if I said, I will suppress and keep in my grief.
<b>my heart is sick within me</b> From the voice of the prophecies that are revealed to me of the coming retributions.

Verse 19

<b>Hark the voice...the cry of the daughter of My people</b> I hear that eventually they will cry from a distant land, but why is all this necessary? Is not the Lord in Zion? If they return to Him, He will allow Himself to be found by them.

Verse 20

<b>The harvest is past, the summer is ended</b> We looked forward to the aid of Egypt, but it did not come. We said, “Let the harvest pass, and they will be free, and they will come.” Now behold, the time of harvest has passed in Iyar, and the summer season in Tammuz, and they have not come.

Verse 21

<b>I mourn</b> lit. I am darkened, an expression of blackness and darkness.
<b>dismay</b> Heb. שמה, wonder.
<b>has taken hold of me</b> Has held me.

Verse 22

<b>Is there no balm in Gilead</b> For balm comes from there, as it is said (infra 46:11) “Go up to Gilead and take balm.” That is to say, Did they not have any righteous men from whom to learn so that they should improve their ways?
<b>the health of</b> lit. the cure of, (emplatre in O.F.), plaster, dressing.

Chapter 9



Verse 1

<b>a company of traitors</b> Companies of traitors.

Verse 2

<b>They have directed</b> Lit. trodden. This expression is appropriate for the preparation of the bow to shoot an arrow, and a bow (קשת) is (arbalete in French), and they tread it with their feet. Therefore, he calls it treading, and the prophet compared their tongue to a treacherous bow, for they directed their tongue like a treacherous bow.
<b>from evil to evil</b> From sin to sin.

Verse 3

<b>forges plans</b> He lays traps.

Verse 4

<b>they commit iniquity [until] they are weary</b> They wearied themselves and toiled to pervert their way. 
העוה is like (Exod. 8:11) “and making heavy (והכבּד) his heart,” to commit iniquity.

Verse 5

<b>Your habitation is in the midst of deceit</b> When they sit, they devise plans of deceit, and with deceit they have exchanged fear of Me and refused to know Me.
<b>because of deceit</b> Heb. בּמרמה.

Verse 6

<b>I will refine them</b> with torments.
<b>because of the daughter of My people</b> Because of the sins of the congregation of Israel.

Verse 7

<b>Their tongue is a deadly arrow</b> Heb. שחוט, drawn. Comp. (I Kings 10:16) “malleable gold” (שחוט). Also, (Hos. 5:2) “And the extent of their turning away (ושחטה),” (tirer in French), pulling. Another explanation is that it is actually an expression of slaughter (tranchant in French, cutting). In this manner Menahem classified it (Machbereth Menahem p. 172), and in this manner Jonathan rendered it: כּגיר די מחרף, like a sharpened arrow.
<b>but in his heart</b> lit. in his midst. Jonathan renders: in his innards.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>for the mountains</b> i.e., for the destruction of the mountains.

For fifty-two years no one passed through Judah; from the exile of Zedekiah until the order of Cyrus, king of Persia, were fifty-two years. An allusion to the matter [is that the numerical value for] “and the beast” (בּהמה) amounts to fifty-two, and the computation is exact, in Tractate Megillah [should read: Yoma 54a].

Verse 10

<b>heaps</b> Heb. דגורין heaps.

Verse 11

<b>Who is the man so wise</b> Who will understand this, and who is the prophet to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken,

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>from the streets</b> Heb. מחוץ, from the street. Comp. (I Kings 20:34) “And you shall make yourself streets in Damascus.”

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>Let not the wise man boast</b> Do not boast, saying, “We are wise.” Behold, you have rejected My words, so what wisdom do you have? If you understand and know Me, then you can boast of your wisdom.

Verse 23

<b>that he understands</b> Heb. השכיל, like (Exod. 8:11) “making heavy (הכבד)” (Enteliant in O.F.).

Verse 24

<b>every circumcised one for his uncircumcision</b> Every circumcised one who has a foreskin, even an uncircumcised heart, and surely I will punish the heathens.

<b>cast off to the corners</b> Heb. פאה, an expression of an end, those cast off to the corner of the desert.

Verse 4

<b>with nails</b> clous in French.
<b>and with sledge hammers</b> A hammer, marteau in French.
<b>it does not bend</b> Heb. יפיק, it does not kneel with its knees. Comp. (I Sam. 25:31) “a stumbling block (פוקה)”; (Nahum 2:11) “and tottering (ופיק) of the knees.”

<b>fear them not</b> if you separate from them for they will not harm you.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>for it befits You</b> It is proper for you.

Verse 8

<b>But with one thing they are brutish</b> i.e., the heathens, and what is that one thing? Their vanities of wood for which they will be punished, and they will be punished for it. יבערו is an expression of foolishness, so is ויכסלו.

Verse 9

<b>Silver beaten into plates</b> Heb. מרקע.

Verse 10

<b>But the Lord God is true</b> Why? Because He is a living God and the King of the world. Therefore, He can make His words come true. A mortal person, however, plans to do something and dies or becomes weak or loses his property, and has no ability to execute his plans.

Verse 11

<b>So shall you say to them</b> This is a letter that Jeremiah sent to Jeconiah and those exiled with him in exile, to reply to the Chaldees in Aramaic, a reply if they tell them to worship idols.

Verse 12

<b>He stretched out</b> Tendre in French.

Verse 15

<b>at the time of their visitation</b> When I will visit retribution upon them.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>Gather in from the land your merchandise</b> Heb. כנעתך. Hide, gather in from the land your merchandise. Comp. (Hos. 12:8) “The trafficker (כּנען) in his hand are deceitful scales.” Menahem explains כנעתך as an expression of humility (הכנעה) and lowliness. And אספי is an expression of bending down. Bend down and humble yourself more than the lowliness of the earth, you Jerusalem, that dwells now in a fortified city (Machbereth p. 107).

Verse 18

<b>sling</b> as one slings a stone with a slingshot.
<b>that</b> they may find their just deserts.

Verse 19

Verse 20

<b>their flocks</b> Heb. מרעיתם, lit. their pasture, the flocks of their pasture.

Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>man’s way is not his</b> For the evil inclination that You created in him leads him astray from the way. Another explanation is: I know, O Lord, that man’s way is not his; not every man has the power to make his way prosper, and if it were not for Your command, the enemy would have no power to destroy Your Temple.

Verse 24

<b>but with justice</b> With chastisements.
<b>with justice</b> (justice in French).
<b>but with justice</b> Jonathan renders: but with mild judgment.
<b>not with Your wrath</b> lest there be complete destruction.

Verse 15

<b>What has my beloved to do in My house</b> What reason has My treasured people to come anymore into My house?
<b>[seeing that]...perform evil design</b> That she does the evil design of her sinful plans.
<b>the many</b> of them.

Verse 16

<b>to the sound of a great tumult</b> Heb. המולה, an expression of the tumult of a large multitude that will come upon them.
<b>And its branches were broken.</b> Heb. ורעו דליותיו. And its branches were shattered. 

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>And the Lord let me know</b> So said the prophet, The Holy One, blessed be He, let me know their retribution.

Verse 19

<b>And I was like a lamb [and] a bull</b> that will be brought to the slaughter.
<b>brought</b> Since I let them know of the evil, they plan to kill me.
<b>like a lamb [and] a bull</b> Heb. ככבש אלוף. Dunash and Judah son of Kudish (Karish) interpreted it as a lamb and a bull, brought to the slaughter. And אלוף is like (Deut. 28:4) “the offspring of your cattle (אלפיך).” Although it was not stated ואלוף, we find similar cases, e.g., (Habukkuk 3:11) “The sun [and] the moon (ירח) stood on high”; (Isaiah 38:14) “Like a crane [and] a swallow (עגור) so I chirp.” And Menahem interpreted ככבש אלוף, a large lamb (see Psalms 58:9, Rashi ad loc.), and Jonathan supports him, since he renders like a choice lamb.
<b>Let us destroy his food with wood</b> Let us put poison into his food.

Verse 20

<b>Let me see Your vengeance against them</b> He cursed the people of Anathoth.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>upon the men of Anathoth</b> Heb. אל-אנשי ענתות, like על-אנשי ענתות, upon the men of Anathoth.

Chapter 12



Verse 1

<b>You are right, O Lord, when I contend with You</b> When I debate with You, I know that you will be right in Your words, but I wish to argue with You so that You will let me know Your way.
<b>Why has the way of the wicked prospered?</b> That You have given greatness to Nebuchadnezzar the wicked, and you have made him succeed in destroying Your house? Another explanation is that he was crying and complaining about the men of Anathoth.
<b>have peace</b> Heb. שלו, an expression of שלוה, peace.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>But You, O Lord, have known me</b> Also, concerning the men of Anathoth You have aided me, for You have known me.
<b>Draw them out like sheep to the slaughter</b> Draw them out of life to death (detache les in French, separate them, cut them off). Comp. (Joshua 8:6) “until we have drawn (התיקנו) them from the city.”
<b>and prepare them</b> Heb. הקדישם, prepare them.

Verse 4

<b>How long will the land mourn and the grass of all the field dry out?</b> Up to here are the prophet’s words, and the Holy Spirit replies to him, “Because of the evil of its inhabitants, beasts and fowl are ended.”
<b>will...mourn</b> Be waste.
<b>ended</b> (finira in French, will terminate).
<b>for they said</b> i.e., the inhabitants of this land have said.
<b>“He will not see our end.”</b> It is not revealed to Him what will be at our end.

Verse 5

<b>For if you have run with foot men and they wearied you</b> Your kin, the priests like you and the men of your city come to kill you. <b>with footmen</b> Heb. רגלים (pieton in O.F), pedestrian.
<b>how will you compete with horses</b> To run with the horses. That is to say, If even your brethren the priests come to kill you, surely the princes of Judah will rise up against you to kill you. This is the reason for My anger against them, and this is the reason for the success of the enemy. And so did Jonathan render: This is the reply, etc. And, according to the Midrash of our Rabbis (Sanhedrin 96a): If you are amazed about the reward for the three steps that Nebuchadnezzar ran in My honor in the days of Merodach-baladan, why I gave him so much greatness, how much more will you be amazed when you see the payment of reward that I will pay the righteous who ran before Me like horses!
<b>will you compete</b> (aastir in O.F.).
<b>and in the peaceful land that you trust</b> there they wearied you.
<b>how will you do in the heights</b> The princes of Judah. The pride of the Jordan is symbolic since it is a place of lions and tigers, and Jonathan taught us this in many places. And here he paraphrased. And how do you expect to do against the wild beasts that are on the height of the Jordan? “And behold, as a lion ascends from the height of the Jordan,” Jonathan renders in two places (infra 49:19, 50:44): like a lion that ascends from the height of the Jordan.

Verse 6

<b>have called a gang after you</b> Heb. מלא, a group of men.

Verse 7

<b>My soul’s beloved</b> My treasured people.

Verse 8

<b>she raised her voice against Me</b> The cry of her violent deeds has ascended before Me.

Verse 9

<b>Is...a speckled bird of prey?</b> The ‘heh’ is that of the interrogative. Therefore, it is vowelized with a ‘pattah.’ Are they like a speckled bird of prey, stained with blood, around which other birds gather? Another explanation:
<b>Is...a speckled bird of prey</b> One bird is speckled, and all the birds gather around it to eat it because they hate it.
<b>Are there birds of prey around her?</b> Are these armies fowl of the heavens, the swift troops that are around her?

Verse 10

<b>Many shepherds</b> The commanders of the troops of Nebuchadnezzar’s army, as it is stated above (6:3): “Shepherds and their flocks shall come to her.”
<b>they have trampled</b> Heb. בססו, an expression of trampling. Cf. (Zech. 10:5) “And they shall be like mighty men trampling (בוסים) the mire of the streets.”
<b>My field</b> Heb. חלקתי, (campagne in French), countryside.

Verse 11

<b>the wasted one mourns before Me</b> Heb. עלי, lit. on Me.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>They sowed wheat, but they reaped thorns</b> They prayed, but their prayer was not accepted. Why? Because they did not plow for themselves a furrow of repentance and good deeds. Therefore, they sowed seeds resulting in thorns. A book in which זרעו is vowelized with a ‘chirik’ under the ‘zayin,’ is erroneous.
<b>they have become ill</b> Heb. נחלו, an expression of illness. They have become ill with their pain and their cry before Me, but they did not avail.
<b>of your increase</b> Of your deeds.

Verse 14

<b>My wicked neighbors</b> Egypt, Ammon and Moab, Tyre and Sidon, who were neighbors of Eretz Israel and were inflicting harm upon them.

Verse 15

<b>I will return and have pity on them</b> They all suffered close to the destruction of the Temple, and concerning each one it is stated in this Book, “I will return the exile of...”

Verse 16

<b>if they learn</b> If they proselytize.
<b>they shall be built up</b> an expression of building.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>bottle</b> Heb. נבל. This is an earthenware vessel, and it is used to hold wine.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>And I will dash them one against the other</b> I will dash one against the other until they break into small pieces. Cf (Psalms 2:9) “Like a potter’s vessel shall you shatter them (תנפצם)” (ibid. 137: 9). “And dash ונפץ your babes”; and so is every expression of נפוץ in Scripture.
<b>and the fathers and the sons</b> I will dash one against the other.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>and before your feet stumble</b> Heb. יתנגפו (achopper in French), to stumble.
<b>the dark mountains</b> Heb. נשף, the dark mountains when they go into exile.
<b>and making it into a thick cloud</b> Heb. ושית, like ולשית, and to make the light into a thick cloud.

Verse 17

<b>because of your pride</b> Because of your greatness which will be curtailed. Another explanation: Because of the pride of the kingdom of Heaven that will be given over to the idols of Babylon.

Verse 18

<b>to the king and to the queen mother</b> Jehoiachin and his mother.
<b>your greatness has come down</b> Heb. מראשתיכם (vostremijevec in O.F.), your ascent, as it is stated: (II Kings 24:12) “And Jehoiachin... came out to him (sic), he and his mother and his servants,” and he led all of them in exile.

Verse 19

<b>The cities of the South are shut up</b> before those coming upon them from the north [i.e.,] the cities of Eretz Israel are shut up because of fear of Nebuchadnezzar.
<b>she was exiled peacefully</b> Jehoiachin will not wage war, but he will come out peacefully, and he will exile them. Another interpretation. שלומים (gueredon in O.F.), reprisal. That is to say: she was exiled as the recompense for their iniquity. And Jonathan rendered in this manner: the recompense of their sins was received.

Verse 20

<b>Lift your eyes and see</b> those coming upon you from the North.
<b>Where is the flock that was given you</b> After they are exiled, this will be said to Jerusalem.

Verse 21

<b>What will you say when He visits</b> i.e., when the Holy One, blessed be He, visits upon you?
<b>when you accustomed them to be princes at your head</b> You sent emissaries to the Chaldees to bring their idols from there to worship them, as it is written in Ezekiel (23 16): “And she lusted for them to the sight of her eyes, and she sent emissaries to them, to the Chaldees.” Another explanation of “you accustomed them to be princes over you”: Hezekiah who showed the emissaries of Merodach-baladan his entire treasure house (Isaiah 39:2, II Kings 20:13).

Verse 22

<b>your skirts</b> The skirts of the garments (tes ourlets in French), your hems. When a woman is stripped in a humiliating way, they turn her chemise upside down.
<b>your steps cut off</b> Your ways are cut off. נחמסו is like (Lam. 2:6) “And He cut off (ויחמֹס) like a garden His dwelling.”
<b>your steps</b> (traces in O.F.) Travelers have stopped.

Verse 23

<b>a Cushite</b> Heb. כושי, the name of a black man, who is called Maure in French, a Moor.
<b>or a leopard</b> leopard in French.
<b>his spots</b> The leopard is spotted, and they are the spots (taches in French), and it is impossible for them to change.
<b>to do evil</b> Heb. הרע, like להרע, to do evil.

Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>the portion of your measures</b> The portion of your measures, a measure for a measure.

Verse 26

<b>have uncovered your skirts</b> I have uncovered the hems of your garments upon your face.

Verse 27

<b>your neighings</b> like the neighing of adulterous horses.
<b>After when</b> will you ever become purified?

Chapter 14



Verse 1

<b>concerning the droughts</b> that He would bring famine upon them, and Menahem (Machbereth p. 47) classified it as an expression of fortification (מִבְצָר) like (Isaiah 25:12) “And the fortress of (וּמִבְצַר) the strength of your walls.”

Verse 2

<b>and her cities</b> Heb. וּשְעָרֶיהָ, lit., her gates.
<b>and the cry of Jerusalem</b> Heb. צִוְחַת, the cry of Jerusalem. Comp. (Isaiah 42:11) “from the mountain peaks they shall shout (יִִִִִצְוָחוּ).

Verse 3

<b>upon pits</b> Pits in which the water is usually gathered.
<b>their vessels have returned empty</b> for no rain has fallen.
<b>and have covered</b> an expression of covering.

<b>farmers</b> bubirs [?] in O.F.

Verse 6

<b>by the rivulets</b> rivulets of water (riveyres in O. F.).

Verse 7

<b>have testified against us</b> Heb. עָנוּ.
<b>do for Your name’s sake</b> Do what You will do with us for the sake of the great name that has spread about You that You rule over all and that we are Your people and the flock of Your pasture, and it is not fitting that You give Your victorious name to the idols. And the Midrash Aggadah explains: for the sake of Your name that is inherent in our name.

Verse 8

<b>hope</b> מִקְוֵה

Verse 9

<b>overcome</b> (d’cru in O.F.) diminished, waned, who withdraws his hand from the battle, and some say (recroyant in O.F.), tiring out, resigned.
<b>and Your name is called upon us</b> Therefore, by doing this, it is no longer honor for you.
<b>forsake us</b> Its explanation is like תַעַזְבֵנוּ, forsake us.

Verse 10

<b>So have they loved to wander</b> So, just as I have decreed upon them exile (to Egypt and Babylon - Warsaw edition), they loved it there to go into exile to worship distant idols.

Verse 11

Verse 18

<b>have gone around</b> They have gone around to seek rescue.
<b>to a land [which] they had not known</b> To another land about which they did not know until then.

Verse 19

<b>or has Your soul despised Zion</b> with the intention of never returning, for, if You have in mind to return, why have You smitten us without a cure?

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>for Your name’s sake</b> that you are called merciful.
<b>the throne of Your glory</b> The Temple. And according to Midrash Aggadah, Israel who is engraved on the throne of Your glory.

Verse 22

<b>Does the heaven give raindrops?</b> by itself, except by Your command? This is the interrogative form. In every double question, the first question is preceded by a ‘heh’ and the second one with אִם, like (Num. 13:19) “Are they in open cities (הַבְּמַחֲנִים) or in fortresses (אִם בְּמִבְצָרִים)?”(Ibid. 13:19) “It is good (הֲטוֹבָה) or bad (אִם רָעָה)?” (verse 19) “Have You indeed rejected (הֲמָאֹס) Judah, or has Your soul despised (אִם...גָּעֲלָה) Zion?” Here, too, “are there among the vanities of the nations those who give rain? Does the heaven...?”

Chapter 15



Verse 1

<b>Moses and Samuel</b> Both were needed to beg mercy for Israel, but first they induced them to repent, and afterwards they prayed on their behalf, but they had no idea of turning away My wrath until they had induced them to repent. Moses said (Exodus 32:27), “Let each man put his sword...” (v. 20) “and he scattered it on the surface of the water, etc.” And afterwards (v. 30), “I will ascend to the Lord, perhaps I will atone.” Samuel in Mizpah (I Samuel 7:4,5) “And the children of Israel removed the Baalim,” and afterwards, “‘Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I shall pray to the Lord on your behalf (sic).’” But you cannot bring them back to Me, therefore do not pray for them.
<b>desire</b> Heb. נַפְֹשִי lit., My soul.

Verse 2

<b>Such as are for death, to death</b> Each calamity mentioned later in this verse is harsher than the one preceding it. The sword is harsher than death. Death by the sword is defacing, whereas death in bed is not defacing. And so he says (Psalms 116:15): “Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His Saints.” Famine is harsher than the sword, for this one is agonizing whereas the other is not agonizing. And so Scripture states (Lam. 4:9): “Better are those who die from the sword than those who die from famine.” Captivity - all sorts of death are in it.

Verse 3

<b>And I will appoint</b> an expression of appointment and designation.
<b>to drag</b> to drag. Cf. (infra. 49: 20) “If the young of the sheep do not drag them (יִסְחָבוּם).”

Verse 4

<b>a horror</b> from the same root as (Esther 5:9), “And he neither rose nor quaked (זָע).” Similarly, גַּאֲוָה pride, from the root (Isa. 16:6) “Have become very proud (גֵּא).”
<b>to all the kingdoms of the earth</b> Anyone who hears the evil that has befallen you will shudder.

Verse 5

<b>will lament</b> Heb. יָנוּד.
<b>and who will turn aside</b> to you, to turn aside from his road to you, to ask of your welfare?

Verse 6

<b>I am weary of repenting</b> Many times I planned to destroy but repented of the evil. Now I am weary of repenting. הִנָחֵם (Dporpnser in O.F.)

Verse 7

<b>with a sieve</b> A sieve called (van in French), like one who winnows barley, so that they should not all be exiled to one place.

Verse 8

<b>are to Me more numerous</b> His widows are more to Me.
<b>upon a mother</b> Upon Jerusalem, which is a city and a mother in Israel.
<b>at midday</b> Everything will be exposed before him, all their hidden treasures.
<b>I have cast upon her suddenly a city</b> I caused the troops of a city and many terrors to rest upon her. Some interpret עִיר as ‘an enemy.’ Cf. (I Sam. 28:16), “And has become [the supporter of] your adversary (עָרֶךָ)” (see also Dan. 4:16).

Verse 9

<b>She who bore seven</b> Samaria and the nation of the Ten Tribes, from whom rose seven dynasties of wicked kings, has already been cut off and exiled.
<b>and their remnant</b> These are Judah and part of Benjamin, who remained in Israel. I shall deliver them to the sword. These are the seven dynasties: Jeroboam son of Nebat and his dynasty, Baasha and his dynasty, Omri and his dynasty, Jehu and his dynasty, Menahem and his dynasty, Pekah and his dynasty, Hoshea and his dynasty.
<b>her soul grieves</b> an expression of ‘her soul grieves.’ We translate (Deut. 28:65) “And grieving of the soul (וְדַאֲבוֹן נֶפֶֹש)” as וּמַפְּחַן נְפָֹש.
<b>when it is still day</b> Before its time, they hastened to fall. In this manner it is expounded in Tractate Gittin. [See Gittin 88a]. And in the Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (Tanhuma Buber, Vayetze p. 153) it is expounded as referring to Jerusalem, and he counts seven wicked men: Jehoram, Jehoash, Ahaz, Manasseh, Amon, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah. But there are yet to count Rehoboam, Abijah, Amaziah, and Ahaziah.
<b>and confounded</b> an expression of shame.

Verse 10

<b>Woe is to me, my mother</b> Jeremiah was complaining about himself, that his townsmen hated him because of his castigations.
<b>and a man of contention</b> a man of quarrel, Cf. (Gen. 6:3) “Let My spirit not contend (יָדוֹן).”
<b>I have not lent</b> Cf. (Exodus 22:24) “You shall not be to him as a creditor (כְּנֹֹֹשֶה) .”
<b>they curse me</b> I do not quarrel with them concerning matters of money that I claim from them, neither have they made any claim on me, yet all the people curse me.

Verse 11

<b>1 leave you over</b> I leave you over, an expression of a remnant. In this manner, Menahem (Machbereth p. 181) interpreted it, but Dunash (Teshuvoth Dunash p. 36) interpreted it as an expression of release. And שֵרִיתִיךָ is like (Dan. 5:12) “And untying (וּמְֹשָרֵא) knots,” and the interpretation of שֵרִיתִיךָ is so, as it is stated (below 40:4): “Behold I have released you from the chains that are on your hand.” That is to say, on that day that the Lord fulfilled His word, it was said to him, “And now, behold I have released you today from the chains that are on your hand, if it pleases you to come with me to Babylon.” And also, Israel begged him to pray for them, as it was said to him (below 42:4): “Pray on our behalf to the Lord our Cod, for we remain few from many.”
<b>Verily I will</b> lit., if not, an expression of an oath.
<b>I will cause [them] to beg you in time of evil</b> with the enemy. When evil befalls them, they will beg you to supplicate God for mercy upon them, for example, Zedekiah said to him, (below 21:2) “Beseech God now on our behalf, etc.” Another explanation. Nebuzaradan will beg you (below 40:4), “If it pleases you to come with me to Babylon.”

Verse 12

<b>Will iron break iron from the north</b> I say that iron that comes from the north is harder than other iron, and this is its interpretation: They were compared to iron (above 6:28), “Going tale bearing like copper and iron.” And concerning Jeremiah it is stated (above 1:18): “I have made you... into an iron pillar and into copper walls,” and his is stronger than theirs, for Nebuchadnezzar will come upon them according to his words.
<b>Will…break</b> Will their iron break yours? Another explanation: Will Pharaoh who comes in your aid, who is as hard as iron, break Nebuchadnezzar, who is iron that comes from the north and copper? Targum Jonathan is inclined toward this direction.

Verse 13

<b>Your wealth</b> An expression of money.
<b>and your treasures</b> He is addressing Israel.
<b>and for all your sins</b> And because of all your sins, this will befall you.
<b>and throughout all your boundaries</b> For you erected idols in all of them.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Take me not to Your long suffering</b> Jonathan renders. Do not grant a reprieve for my humiliation. Do not take my cause to leave it for Your long suffering, but hasten and avenge me.
<b>I bore</b> like סָבַלְתִּי bore.
<b>for Your sake</b> for You.

Verse 16

<b>Your words were found and I ate them</b> eagerly at the beginning, and they were a joy for me, for I thought that now they would listen to me.

Verse 17

<b>because of Your hand</b> Because of the prophecy that came to me from You.
<b>I sat</b> alone and bewildered by mourning, for You filled me with a prophecy of fury concerning the destruction of Your House.

Verse 18

<b>You are to me</b> Heb. הָיוֹ תִהְיֶה. <b>as a failing spring</b> Like a man whose trust has been cut off from him, for you allow me to suffer at their hands. אַכְזָב is a spring that stops (faylayne in O. F:), failing.
<b>water that is not faithful</b> to rely upon it.

Verse 19

<b>Therefore</b> Because I suffer from these troubles.
<b>so said the Lord</b> to me.
<b>If you return</b> You, Israel, through me, and I will return you to Him, He said to Me, “You will stand before Me.”
<b>and if you take precious out of the vile</b> If you take a pious man from a wicked man, i.e., if you bring him to repentance.
<b>You shall be as my mouth</b> For I make a decree and you annul it.
<b>Let them return to you, but you shall not return to them</b> Let them return to your word, but you shall not return to stray after them.

Verse 5

<b>house of mourning</b> feasting. In Sifrei, in the section dealing with Beth-peor (Balak), I saw. They returned to make feasts (מַרְזֵיחִין) for them, but our Rabbis explained מַרְזֵחַ as ‘a mourner.’
<b>you bemoan</b> you shall lament.
<b>for I have gathered in My peace, etc.</b> When their father Abraham performed charity and justice, I gave his children loving-kindness and mercy, as in Deut. 7:12: “And the Lord your God shall keep for you the covenant and the loving-kindness, etc.” Also (Deut. 13:18), “And He shall give you mercy.” They turned “justice into wormwood, and cast righteousness to the ground” (Amos 5:7). I, too, have returned and gathered in to Me My loving-kindness and My mercies.
<b>I have gathered in</b> (ote in O.F.), taken off. Comp. (Gen. 30:23) “God has gathered (אסף) in my disgrace.”

Verse 6

<b>And large and small shall die</b> And since everyone will die, why should you lament?
<b>and they shall not cut their flesh nor shall they tear their hair for them</b> It is the custom of mourners to cut and tear their flesh and to tear their hair our of their head. In any case, it is forbidden for Jews, but he mentions it here only as an example of mourning.

Verse 7

<b>And they shall not break [bread] for them</b> an expression of breaking. Comp. (Dan. 5:25) “Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin, (divided).” This alludes to the practice of giving a meal to the mourners in the city square and they break for them the bread upon reciting the blessing of ‘hamotzi.’ (I Sam. 9: 13) “For he will bless the sacrifices,” Jonathan renders: He will break (פָרִיס) bread.
<b>neither will they give them to drink etc</b> This is the reason for what I said, “Neither go to lament.”

Verse 8

<b>And to a house of feasting</b> that I said to you above, “You shall not go,” this is the reason: Behold, I will cut off from this place, etc.

Verse 14

<b>Therefore</b> An expression of an oath. Although you betrayed Me, I have an oath that I will redeem you.
<b>and it shall no longer be said</b> Our Rabbis expounded: Not that the departure from Egypt shall be uprooted from its place, but the final redemption will be the most important and the departure from Egypt secondary to it.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>and they will fish them</b> Just as the fisher takes - it i.e., - the fish from its habitat, so will these capture them within the city, and just as the manner of a fish, that when he is caught he dies, so will I bring killers upon them, and afterwards I will send hunters for the survivors and for those who flee from the sword to the mountains and the hills, and they will hunt them to exile them in captivity.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>the doubling of their iniquity</b> Because they repeated their iniquity to do the iniquities of their fathers. And Jonathan renders in this manner: And I will recompense the second ones like the first ones double.

Verse 19

<b>and my refuge</b> (mon vantement in French), my boast. And Menahem (Machbereth p. 123) classified it as an expression of a wonder. Cf. (Psalms 60:6) “You have given those who fear You a wonder to be wondrous (נֵס לְהִתְנוֹסֵס).”
<b>to You nations will come</b> Eventually, the heathens will come to you and worship You of one accord, and they will say, “How did they make gods for themselves, and they are no gods?”
<b>from the ends of</b> Like מִקְצֵה, from the end of.

<b>avail</b> an expression of use (תּוֹעֶלֶת).

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>that My name is the Lord</b> As its apparent meaning, a ruler and a sovereign to fulfill My decree.

Chapter 17



Verse 1

<b>with a pen of iron</b> This is an allegory. That is to say that it is deeply engraved, and cannot be erased. And the Midrash Aggadah explains: with a pen of iron, with a diamond point, preserved by Jeremiah, called ‘an iron wall,’ and by Ezekiel, to whom it was said (3:9): “As a diamond, harder than flint have I made your forehead.”
<b>engraved</b> Engraved like one who plows deeply.
<b>on the tablet of their heart</b> that they do not forget their idolatry.

Verse 2

<b>As they remember their children, [so do they remember] their altars</b> Like the remembrance of their children, so was the remembrance of their altars to them, like a man who longs for his son.
<b>and their asherim</b> which are by the green trees. <b>by...trees</b> like אֵצֶּל, by. And Jonathan renders in this manner. under every green tree.

Verse 3

<b>You, who sit upon the mountain in the field</b> Jerusalem that is situated on the mountain of the plain. All around the city is a fielded plain. The structure of הֲרָרִי is like עֲרָבִי, called so because he dwells in the plain (עֲרָבָה) (montanyers in O.F), mountain dwellers (other versions: a mountain dweller).
<b>your substance</b> like מָמוֹנְךָ, your money.
<b>Your high places are made for sin</b> Your high places are made in sin for the purpose of idolatry within all your borders.

Verse 4

<b>And you shall release</b> Perforce you will release your land for the time that it did not rest on your Sabbaths, which I said to you (Lev. 25:2), “And the land shall rest a Sabbath for the Lord.”
<b>of you</b> I will avenge Myself of you because of your heritage that I gave you, that you did not perform My will to release it. Another explanation: even of you, from your heritage; I will avenge Myself of you from your heritage, that I will exile you from it.
<b>for you have kindled fire in My nostrils</b> Heb. קְדַכְתֶּם.

Verse 5

<b>who trusts in man</b> In his plowing and his harvest, saying, “I will sow during the seventh year and I will eat.”
<b>his arm</b> Like ‘his help,’ and so did Jonathan render: his trust.
<b>and whose heart turns away from the Lord</b> Who promised him (Lev. 25:21), “And I will command My blessing to you.” This is what I heard.

Verse 6

<b>like a lonely tree</b> like a lonely tree, an expression of (Gen. 15:2) “Childless (עֲרִירִי),” and some say (degat in O.F) laid waste, and Menahem (Machbereth Menahem p. 137) explained: The name of a tree of the forest trees, and its name is ar’ar, and this is the explanation of (infra 48.6) “Like an ‘aroer’ in the desert,” one of the trees of the forest.
<b>in the plain</b> an expression of a plain.
<b>parched land</b> aridness. Comp. (Job 30:30) “Became dry (חָרָה) from heat.”
<b>salt-sodden soil</b> Land that is salty and will not be settled.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>and will not see</b> The tree will not see when heat comes.
<b>drought</b> an expression of hunger, (famine in French). Another interpretation: בַּצֹרֶת is an expression of fortification (מִבְצָר), and in this manner, Menahem (Machbereth Menahem p. 47) classified it.
<b>will not be anxious</b> will not be afraid.

Verse 9

<b>The heart is deceitful</b> Full of pretext and deceit of all evil.
<b>and when it is sick</b> an expression of sickness, and this is its sickness.
<b>who recognizes it?</b> He thinks, “Who recognizes it?” I, the Lord, search it.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>The cuckoo calls</b> (Coucou glousse in French).
<b>but has not laid</b> This cuckoo draws after it chicks that it did not lay. דָגָר - This is the chirping which the bird chirps with its voice to draw the chicks after it, but those whom the cuckoo called will not follow it when they grow up for they are not of its kind. So is one who gathers riches but not by right.
<b>he stands dishonored</b> He is called wicked.

Verse 12

<b>As a Throne of Glory</b> Since he wishes to state: All that forsake You shall be shamed, he commences with the praise of the Omnipresent, and says before Him, “You, Whose Throne of Glory is exalted from the beginning of the Creation of the world and is directed opposite our Sanctuary.”

Verse 13

<b>The Lord Who is the source of the hopes of Israel</b> sits upon it. Therefore, all that forsake You shall be shamed.
<b>and they that turn away from me shall be marked on the earth</b> Those who turn away from my words, who do not hearken to my message, will be marked out in the nether graves of the earth.

Verse 14

<b>for You are my praise</b> I praise myself and boast with You, saying that You are my Savior.
<b>my praise</b> (vantance in O.F.), boast.

Verse 15

<b>“Where is the word of the Lord?</b> The retribution which you prophesy.

Verse 16

<b>But I did not hasten</b> I did not hasten to urge You to bring them because I am a good shepherd, who goes after You to beg mercy for them.
<b>and...the woeful day</b> The illness of their retribution I did not desire. Jonathan renders: And I did not hamper Your word from prophesying concerning them to return them to fear You. According to the Targum, אַצְתִּי is an expression of hampering. That is to say, I did not hesitate from telling them Your message and to return them to you if they would hearken to me.
<b>What came out of my lips was before Your face</b> to return Your wrath from them.

Verse 17

<b>Let it not be to me for a ruin</b> Let not Your mission be to me for a ruin.

Verse 13

<b>disgraceful thing</b> Heb. שַעֲרֻרִת.

Verse 14

<b>Shall one abandon from rocks of the field the snow of Lebanon</b> Shall a man who needs to drink abandon water that flows from the rock in the fields that comes from the snow of the Lebanon, which is clean?
<b>Shall strange cold... water be abandoned?</b> Or shall flowing spring water, which was strange to all people until now, and it is cold, be abandoned? זָרִים means flowing, and this proves it (2 Kings 19:24): “I dug and drank strange water (זָרִים).” Menahem, however, classified with (Isaiah 1:6) “they have not been sprinkled (זֹרוּ), neither have they been bandaged,” an expression of curative water, and he gave a reason for his statement, and he said that if he wished to speak with an expression of זֶרֶם, a stream, he would double the ‘mem,’ and he would add ‘yud’ ‘mem,’ and he would say זְרוּמִים because of the plural number of מַיִם water, and because they are streams (זְרָמִים).
<b>the field</b> like שָדֶה, a field
<b>cold</b> (froids in French).
<b>flowing</b> (courants in French). And we can also interpret it: “Shall it be abandoned to be strange rejected water, the water that is cold running water?”
<b>Heb.</b> זרים According to the first interpretation, it is an expression of a stream [זֶרֶם]. According to the second interpretation, it is an expression of strangeness, i.e., rejected water.)

Verse 15

<b>For</b> so have My people done, that they have forgotten Me and burnt incense to vanity.
<b>ancient paths</b> The proper paths they said that they are a stumbling block, in order to go...<b>[on] a way that is not trodden down</b> Heb. סְלוּלָה.

<b>will be astonished</b> will wonder.

Verse 17

<b>I will look</b> but I will not save them.

Verse 18

<b>And they said, “Come, etc.”</b> Jeremiah was complaining about the men of Anathoth and saying that they say this.
<b>Torah...from the priest</b> For it is incumbent upon the priests to teach the Torah, as it is stated (Deut. 33:10): “They shall teach Your ordinances to Jacob.”
<b>not speech from the prophet</b> I. e., words of prophecy.
<b>Come, let us strike him with the tongue</b> Let us testify falsely against him.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>and spill their blood</b> (Bring them down by the sword,) an expression of (Lam. 3:49) “My eye runs (נִגְרָה)”; (Micah 1:4) “Like water that runs (מֻגָרִים).”
<b>by the sword</b> by troops.
<b>and their husbands</b> i.e., the husbands of the widows shall be slain by the angel of death.

Verse 22

<b>for they dug a pit to seize me</b> that they suspected him of intimacy with a married woman, as it is stated (Prov. 23:27): “For a harlot is a deep pit (ֹשוּחָה).”

Verse 23

<b>let not be erased</b> let it not be erased. And because it is a feminine gender, he placed a ‘yud’ therein. This too is superfluous, as the ‘yud’ of (Ezekiel 16:17) “And you played the harlot (וַתִּזְנִי) with them.”

Chapter 19



Verse 1

<b>a jug</b> Heb. בַּקְבֻּק.
<b>potter’s earthen</b> That is to say, of a potter, which is of earthenware.
<b>and some of the elders of the people</b> take along with you. “And of the elders of the people” refers back to ‘Go,’ and some of the elders of the people with you.

Verse 2

<b>the Harsith Gate</b> The Dung Gate, where broken pottery is cast, and Jonathan rendered in this manner תְרַע קִלְקַלְתָּא.

Verse 3

<b>his ears will tingle</b> (tinter in French), an expression similar to “cymbals” (מְצִלְתַּיִם) (Neh. 12: 27), “with loud sounding cymbals (בְּצִלְצְלֵי ֹשָמַע)” (Psalms 150:5).

Verse 4

<b>and they estranged</b> They made it strange before Me.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>And I will frustrate</b> and I will empty, an expression similar to (Nahum 2:11), “She is empty and void (בּוּקָה וּמְבוּקָה),” and because of the jug (בַּקְבֻּק) about which he is speaking, he adopted this expression.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>the straits</b> An expression of pain, like צוקה.

Verse 10



Verse 11

(<b>which can no longer be repaired</b> This refers to the people, but the city I will make like the Topheth and purify it in the future.)

Verse 12

<b>this city like the Topheth</b> All of it will be full of the slain just as the Topheth, where they slay the children for Molech.

Chapter 20



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>and placed him in the prison</b> the name of a place of a prison, and Jonathan rendered: לכיפתא (arvolud in O.F.), a vault.

Verse 3

<b>Magor</b> Terror.
<b>Not Passhur did the Lord call your name, etc.</b> Your name was not called Pashhur except for this matter, that is to say: פָֹשַח ֹשָחוֹר, cut off and black like “a tree that was cut off (נִפְֹשַח)” (Shevi’ith 4:6, Orlah 1:5). Also (Lam. 3:11), “And He cut me off (וַיִפַֹשְחֵנִי).” And so he said to him, Not Pashhur did He call your name, for the expression of Pashhur means a great man and the son of nobles, Pashhur. ‘Pash’ denotes expansion and ‘hur’ nobility. But for this reason your name was called Pashhur, Pashah shahor. ‘Pashah’ means ‘cut off,’ and ‘shahor’ means ‘black.’ Another explanation. ‘Pashah sehor.’ Many will be around you to slay you. Now according to this explanation, מָגוֹר is an expression of gathering, like (Ezekiel 21:17) “Gathered (מְגוּרֵי) to the sword.”

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>the wealth</b> money.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>You enticed me</b> to go on your mission.
<b>You overcame me</b> You made Your strong hand heavy upon me to go against my will.
<b>and You prevailed</b> And You were victorious.
<b>everyone</b> All the people mock me.

Verse 8

<b>Whenever I speak</b> Every time I speak to them, I must cry out and raise my voice, and I do not proclaim good for them but prophecies of violence and spoil.
<b>for the word of the Lord has been...for me</b> Therefore, they spoke to me with scorn, for they scorn me.
<b>and mockery</b> for speech. Comp. (Ezekiel 22:4) “and mockery (וְקַלָּסָה).”

Verse 9

<b>Should I say: I will not mention Him</b> If my heart said to me not to go on Your mission anymore.
<b>it would be in my heart</b> i.e., the prophecy, <b>like a burning fire</b> And against my will I must go.
<b>confined in my bones</b> And as if the fire were confined in my bones.
<b>to contain</b> To endure the fire.

Verse 10

<b>For I heard</b> I said that I would not mention Him because I heard the speech of many, those who whisper about me.
<b>a gathering</b> an expression of gathering, and so did Jonathan render it.
<b>tell</b> false testimony against him.
<b>and let us tell about him</b> and let us testify against him. And Menahem (Machbereth p. 53) explained ונגידֶנוּ like (Deut. 14:1) “You shall not cut yourselves (לא תתגודדוּ).” He also joined (Job 17:5) “For the sake of flattering, he destroys (יגיד) his friends.” This is an expression of destruction. Comp. (Dan. 4:11) “Cut down (גֹדוּ) the trees.” But Dunash (Teshuvoth p. 54) interpreted it as an actual expression of telling, and this is its interpretation: “Tell false things about him and we will tell about him to the king.” And we have like נַגִידֶנוּ, we will tell about him, many words in the Scriptures that cannot be interpreted unless they are divided into two words or three. Comp. (Gen. 37: 4) “And they could not speak with him (דַבְּרוֹ) peacefully.” Also (supra 10:20), “My children have left me (יצאני).”
<b>await my destruction</b> Heb. צַלְעֵי 
<b>Perhaps he will be enticed.</b> to listen to us and to stray after us. and we will prevail against him to bring him to commit idolatry.

Verse 11

<b>for they did not succeed</b> They did not succeed with their plan.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>Cursed be the day in which I was begotten</b> (engendrer or engenrer in O.F.). That is the time of conception, and through compulsion Hilkiah his father performed the marriage act by day, for he was fleeing from before Manasseh, who was slaying the prophets, and he performed the marriage act and fled.

Verse 15

<b>making him glad</b> The ‘mem’ is punctuated with a ‘dagesh,’ which is an expression of making others glad, for he made his father glad with his news.

Verse 16

<b>like the cities that...overturned</b> Namely Sodom and Gemorrah.
<b>and did not repent</b> Since He decreed destruction upon them, he did not think another thought to rescind His decree.

Verse 17

<b>That he did not put me to death</b> I.e., that the angel of death did not put me to death from the womb, and this is one of the verses with brief language.
<b>a perpetual pregnancy</b> a pregnancy of eternity.

Verse 18

<b>toil and grief</b> The destruction of the Temple.

Verse 4

<b>Behold I turn back the weapons of war</b> There are some among you who know how to adjure the heavenly princes in charge of retribution, that each one save them from the evil he is in charge of, and you rely on that. Behold, I will transfer one’s authority to another one, and you will not know whom to adjure.
<b>and I will gather them</b> i.e., the weapons of war, into this city, that I will destroy you with pestilence through the angel of death, who is one of the heavenly princes. And in this manner it is explained in the chapter (v. 6): “with a great pestilence they shall die.”

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>and he will have his life as a prey</b> As a man who plunders booty, and he seizes and goes away, so will his life be plundered from death by the slayers.

Verse 10

<b>My anger</b> as the Targum, רוּגְזִי My anger.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>from the hand of the robber</b> Its accent is below for it is not a noun but a noun denoting the robber who robs others.
<b>with no one to extinguish [it]</b> that no one of you will escape as a survivor.

Verse 13

<b>O dweller of the valley</b> Jerusalem is in the midst of a valley. Another explanation. That the Holy One, blessed be He, devised a deep plot against you to destroy you.
<b>rock of the plain</b> Mountain, entirely surrounded by plain.
<b>Who will encamp upon us</b> who will encamp upon us. Comp. (II Kings 6: 9) “For there the Arameans are encamped (נְחִתִּים).”

Chapter 22

Verse 6

<b>You are [as] Gilead to Me, etc.</b> Even if you are as dear to Me as the Temple, which is high on the mountain peaks, I swear that I will make you a desert.
<b>You are [as] Gilead</b> The Temple from which balm and healing emanate to the whole world.

Verse 7

<b>And I will prepare</b> and I will prepare.
<b>and they will cut your choice cedars</b> Since he compares him to the Lebanon, this expression is appropriate.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>Weep not for the dead</b> Namely, for Jehoiakim, who will die before the gate, when they drag him into exile.
<b>weep for him who goes</b> For Jehoiachin and for Zedekiah. Deduce from here that Jehoiakim’s death, concerning which it is stated (infra 36:30): “And his carcass shall be cast to the heat by day and to the cold at night,” is preferable to the life of Jehoiachin, about whom it is stated (52:34): “And his meals, regular meals, etc.”

Verse 11

<b>concerning Shallum</b> That is Zedekiah, and that is what he was called in I Chron. (3:14): “the fourth Shallum.” And he called him the Fourth, meaning the fourth to assume the kingship of Josiah’s sons, for first Jehoaha, reigned, then Jehoiakim, and after him Jehoiachin, and after him Zedekiah.
<b>who left</b> Even though he hadn’t left yet, he prophesied as if he had already left.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Woe to him who builds his house</b> He is saying this about Jehoiakim, who was a wicked man, and the end of the section proves this: “Therefore, so said the Lord about Jehoiakim.”

Verse 14

<b>a wide house</b> a large house. Cf. (Num. 13:32) “Men of great stature (אַנְֹשֵי מִדּוֹת),” who have what to measure.
<b>and he cuts out...for himself</b> And he widens for himself (Some emend: And he opens for himself) Comp. (supra 4:30) “that you enlarge (וַתִּקְרְעִי)...with paint.” Also (Isaiah 63:19), “Had You rent (קָרַעְתְּ) the heavens, had You descended.” They are all an expression of opening.
<b>and ceiled with cedar</b> He covers the roof with cedars.
<b>and painted with vermilion</b> painted with dyes, so does Jonathan render. בּשָּׁשַּׁר is a color of a type used for painting. Another explanation: וּמָשּׁוֹחַ בִּשָּׁשַּׁר is like a cord used for measuring (חוּט הַמִּשְּׁחָה) ([a] lignant en sinople in O.F.), drawing green lines, delineate with a green color.

Verse 15

<b>Shall you reign</b> Will you live long that you contend to make your rule oppressive to let all know that you are a king?
<b>your father</b> Josiah, who demeaned himself with humility, did he not eat and drink and enjoy pleasure all the days of his life?

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>on your gain</b> to steal money.
<b>the crushing</b> the crushing of the poor, and עֹשֶק, oppression proves it, for ‘oppressed’ and ‘crushed’ are always juxtaposed in the language of the Scriptures. Cf. (I Sam. 12: 3) “Whom did I oppress or whom did I crush?”

Verse 18

<b>Hoe, his glory!</b> Woe for his glory.

Verse 19

<b>A donkey’s burial</b> As they drag the carcass of a donkey, so will they drag his carcass. The word יְֹשַגְּרוּן used by Targum Jonathan means, they will drag.

Verse 20

<b>Ascend the Lebanon and cry</b> Go up to the Temple and cry.
<b>and on Bashan give forth your voice</b> On Bashan which will be destroyed. And Jonathan paraphrased: And in the gates of the Temple Mount. And I do not know how to explain how the expression ‘Bashan’ fits to the gates of the Temple Mount, unless it is because of the doors which they make from the terebinths of Bashan, and that is the name of a place, or the expression, ‘Bashan’ denotes a place of a wide valley. So is the area of the Temple Mount an open area around the Temple.
<b>and cry for Avarim</b> And cry for Megizatha. They are place names.

Verse 21

<b>in your peaceful times</b> when you lived in peace.

Verse 22

<b>All your shepherds</b> All your kings.
<b>shall be broken by the wind</b> The east wind shall break them.

Verse 23

<b>who nest in the cedars</b> For you placed your nest in the towers of the cedar houses to build wide houses.
<b>how gracious shall you be</b> What grace have you found because of the height of your towers, in the eyes of your plunderers, when birth pangs come upon you. And Menahem interpreted נֵחַנְתְּ as an expression of camping, but Dunash interpreted it as an expression of grace.

Verse 24

<b>a signet</b> Engraved and sealed in the flesh of My arm.
<b>I will remove you</b> Cf. (supra 12:3) “Draw them out (התִקֵם) like sheep to the slaughter” (Jos. 8:6) “Until we have drawn (התִקֵינוּ) them.” And the ‘nun’ is superfluous. And, according to the Midrash Aggadah (Pesikta d’Rav Kahana, p. 163a): In the place to which he was removed (נִתַּק), there he was rectified (נִתְקַן), for he repented in Babylon, and the Holy One, blessed be He, applied for absolution of the oath He had sworn, “Inscribe this man childless.” and Zerubbabel was born to him in Babylon, and it was said to him through the prophet (Haggai 2:23), “On that day...I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you as a signet,” directed toward what He said to his father, “Though...be a signet on My right arm,...I will remove him (sic).”

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>And I will cast</b> an expression of throwing.

Verse 27

<b>they long</b> This is an expression of consolation, that their soul lifts itself to console itself and to say, “We will again return to our land.”

Verse 28

<b>Is...a despised... image</b> It is a rhetorical question. Is this man a broken and despised image, that he was cast away from My face like a vessel in which there is no use?
<b>shattered</b> broken. Cf. (Psalms 2: 8) “Like a potter’s vessel you shall shatter them (תְּנַפְּצֵם).” [Others annotated: הַעֶצֶב is like the idols (הָעֲצַבִּים). “We may swathe (מְעַצְּבִין) an infant” in Tractate Shabbath 22:6. That is to say, “Are you despised and broken in your eyes like a small infant who is being swathed (emmailloter in French)? This one is not worthy.”
<b>cast away</b> thrown, an expression of throwing that has no restoration. Comp. (Psalms 37:24), “If he falls, he will not be cast off (יוּטָל).”

Verse 29

<b>The Lord is our righteousness</b> The Lord will vindicate us during this one’s days.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>Because of the prophets my heart is broken within me</b> Because of the words of the prophets who say, “You shall have peace,” my heart is broken. <b>shake</b> sway like the wings of a bird who hovers over his nest, (trenblent in O.F.) tremble.
<b>because of the Lord</b> For I heard from Him this evil decree.

Verse 10

<b>because of oaths</b> False oaths.
<b>mourns</b> i.e., is destroyed.
<b>their eagerness</b> (course in French,) their course, their running. But Jonathan renders it as an expression of desire.
<b>not right</b> Not according to the law.

Verse 11

<b>even in My house have I found their evil</b> For they placed an image in the Temple.

Verse 12

<b>like slippery places</b> Smooth ground upon which the foot slips and the person falls.
<b>like slippery places in the dark</b> Stumbling upon stumbling. On slippery places in the light there is stumbling. In the dark without slippery places, there is stumbling.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

Verse 18

<b>For who stood in the council of the Lord</b> and will hear what is decreed by Him? He who hearkened to the word of His Torah and listened to His commandments, but not these wicked men. The first expression of ֹשְמִיעָה in the verse is actual hearing; the latter expression of ֹשְמִיעָה is an expression of acceptance.

Verse 19

<b>a whirling</b> A resting storm, a storm which seeks to rest, and it shall rest on the heads of the wicked.

Verse 20

<b>the plans of</b> an expression of thought.

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>And if they stood in My council, they should have let My people hear My word, etc.</b> They should have let My people hear My words and My Torah, rather than cause them to stray away from Me.

Verse 23

<b>Am I a God from near</b> that I do not see but what is close to Me and have I no power to judge the lower creatures that are far from Me and do I not know of their deeds?

Verse 24

<b>Can a man hide in secret places</b> This is a repetition of the question, ‘Am I a God from near,’ according to the manner of all double questions.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>How long [will this be]?</b> That they will prophesy falsely? Do these prophets who prophesy falsely have in their heart to execute their thoughts that they are thinking to cause My people to forget My name, etc.?
<b>deceit</b> an expression of מִרְמָה, deceit.

Verse 27



Verse 28

<b>let him tell a dream</b> Let him tell it as vain talk like other dreams, and let him not presume it as words of prophecy.
<b>What has the straw to do with the wheat?</b> What has falsehood to do with truth?
<b>with the wheat</b> like עִם-הַבָּר.

Verse 29

<b>Is not My word so like fire?</b> They should not have erred to compare their dreams to say that they are prophecy, for the prophetic word, when it comes to a prophet, it comes into him with force like a burning fire, as the matter is stated (supra 20:9): “And it was in my heart like a burning fire,” and (Ezekiel 3:14): “And the hand of the Lord became strong upon me.”
<b>and as a hammer</b> (pic in French), a pick. And some say (marteau in French), a hammer.

Verse 30

<b>those who steal My wards from one another</b> They have spies who spy upon the true prophets, who listen to their expression with which they prophesy and say false prophecies with that same expression, as Hananiah son of Azzur did. He heard Jeremiah prophesying in the upper marketplace, “Behold I break the bow of Elam,” and he prophesied in the lower marketplace, “I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon” (28:2), as our Rabbis wrote in Sanhedrin 89a.

Verse 31

<b>those who train their tongues</b> who teach their tongues to say their falsehoods with the expression, “Says the Lord,” like the true prophets, so that they should believe them.

Verse 32

<b>with their bewilderment</b> an expression of wonder (estordisoun in O. F.).

Verse 33

<b>“What is the burden of the Lord?”</b> This is an expression of derision, for his prophecy is a burden to them.
<b>you shall say to them, “What burden? And I will forsake you, etc.”</b> They say to you (sic), “What is the burden?” You are the burden of the Holy One, blessed be He, and He says that He will forsake you and cast you off His arms from heaven to earth. So I heard.
<b>and I will forsake</b> Heb. וְעָזַבְתִּי.

Verse 34



Verse 35



Verse 36

<b>For the burden shall be to the man of His word</b> Although you pervert the massa into a pejorative, the prophecy (משא) of the word of the Lord shall be to the man of His word, and to the man of His counsel He reveals it, but you pervert it to an expression of a burden. This interpretation I did not hear, but it is the main interpretation. But this is how I heard it, namely that the burden shall be a burden of retribution for the one who says it, who asks, “What is the burden?” Another interpretation: משא is an expression of prophecy, and the false prophet would ask the true prophet to tell him the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, in the language in which the expression came to him, and the expression did not explain the speech adequately. Therefore, the false prophet would pervert it to another meaning and would speak after the fashion of the true prophet in order that they should believe him. And so did Hananiah son of Azzur do. Therefore, he says, “Do not ask the prophecy of the Lord,” the language of the expression, but “What did He speak?” or “What did He reply?” The explanation of the words you shall ask the true prophet to tell you what the Holy One, blessed be He, says, and to what His words are inclined.
<b>for the prophecy shall be for the man of His word</b> The unexplained expression the Holy One, blessed be He, said unexplained to the man of His counsel, who is not suspected of perverting it, but you ask it in order to pervert it, and you pervert the words of the Holy One, blessed be He, and that is what is stated above (v. 30): “those who steal My words from one another.” This too is a correct explanation.

Verse 37

<b>So shall you say to the prophet</b> when you come to ask My words of the prophet.

Verse 38



Verse 39

<b>and I will exile</b> an expression of “the sinew that was dislocated (גִיד הַנָֹּשֶה)” (Gen. 32:33), and an expression of “their might has failed (נָֹשְתָה),” it jumps and moves from place to place.

Chapter 24



Verse 1

<b>pots</b> Heb. דּוּדָאֵי.
<b>prepared</b> Heb. מוּעדים.
<b>the craftsmen and the sentries of the gates</b> Torah scholars who were exiled with Jeconiah, and I already explained in the Book of Kings (II 24:14) הֶחָרָש וְהַמַּסְגֵּר (les maitres, les portiers in French) the masters, the sentries of the gates. Another explanation: הֶחָרָש וְהַמַּסְגֵּר: הֶחָרָש is an expression of silence, וְהַמַּסְגֵּר is an expression of closing. That is to say, great sages in Torah, to the extent that when one of them would speak, everyone would remain silent. מַסְגֵּר means that when they would close the discussion, no one would reopen it.

Verse 2

<b>like the first ripe figs</b> that have ripened completely in the beginning of the ripening of the figs which are dear to all those who find them in their beginning.

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>so will I recognize the exile of, etc.</b> This is an inverted verse: So will I recognize for good the exile of Judah which I have already exiled, viz., Jeconiah and his exile.

Verse 6

<b>and not pluck them</b> an expression of uprooting.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>for a horror [and] for evil for all the kingdoms of the earth</b> For they will hear the evil that came upon them and quake.
<b>and for a conversation piece</b> That everyone will repeat and discuss their retribution.

Chapter 25



Verse 1

<b>in the fourth year</b> The year that their decree was sealed that they be exiled and that they drink the cup of wrath, as he says in this section (v. 15): “Take the cup, etc.,” and before the decree He commanded the prophet to reprove them, perhaps they would repent, and their decree would not be sealed.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>twenty-three years</b> Josiah reigned thirty-one years (II Kings 22:1). Subtract twelve years from them (Jer. 1:2). This leaves nineteen, and four of his son amount to twenty-three.
<b>arising early</b> This is a present tense. I would arise early and speak constantly.

Verse 15

Verse 31

Verse 35



Verse 36



Verse 37

<b>shall be destroyed</b> an expression of destruction, an expression related to ‘has silenced us (הֲדִמָּנוּ) .’ ‘and there let us sit in silence (וְנִדְּמָה).’

Verse 38

<b>He has left his hut like a young lion</b> The king has gone in exile from his city like a young lion that leaves his hut.
<b>because of the wrath of the oppressing sword</b> drunk from wine. So did Jonathan translate. Another explanation: It is an expression of oppression (אוֹנָאָה).

Verse 20

<b>Also a man was prophesying</b> The one who said this did not say this. I.e., those who related the incident of Micah did not relate the incident concerning Uriah. Up to here are the words of the righteous. Now the wicked who were there arose and said, “Also a man was prophesying, etc.” Just as Uriah was killed, so shall Jeremiah be killed. In this way it is explained in Sifrei (Num. 11:7).

Chapter 27



Verse 1

<b>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim</b> Three years prior to Nebuchadnezzar’s ascent to the throne, he prophesied about him that he would reign.

Verse 2

<b>thongs</b> They are the thongs of the yoke that are called kongoijli (cojongles).

Verse 3

<b>the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the children of Ammon, etc.</b> These five kings Nebuchadnezzar placed under the authority of Zedekiah. Fifteen years they (the bars and thongs) were on his neck, from the first year of Jehoiakim until the fourth year of Zedekiah, when Hananiah son of Azzur broke them off him.

Verse 22

Chapter 28



Verse 1

<b>And it came to pass in that year</b> When that time arrived that Nebuchadnezzar gave Zedekiah dominion over the five kings to whom Jeremiah stated his message and sent the thongs and the bars to the kings by the hand of their ambassadors.
<b>in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah</b> In the beginning of his dominion over the five kings. But it is impossible to say that it means at the beginning of his reign, since it says, “in the fourth year.” In that year, he went down to greet Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon, and Seraiah the receptionist was with him, as is stated at the end of the Book (51:59), and he gave him dominion over the kings.
<b>said to me</b> Our Sages state: Who misled Hananiah? He heard Jeremiah prophesying in the upper street, “Behold I am breaking the bow of Elam” (49:35). And this prophecy was said in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, as is explained there, and since Elam is adjacent to Babylon, he stood in the lower street, and expounded. And he derived a major case from a minor one. If Elam, who came only to aid the Chaldeans, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Behold I am breaking the bow of Elam,” how much more is this so with the Chaldeans themselves? He came into the lower street and said: So said the Lord: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon, as it is in Sanhedrin (89a).

Verse 6

<b>may...do</b> Fasse in French.
<b>May...fulfill</b> An expression of prayer. (These three lines up to “and he brought him to the prison” were not arranged by the author.) <b>Amen! So may the Lord do, etc.</b>Amen! The scholars of Aggadah say: So did he say to him: If only your words were fulfilled! I gain and you lose. I am a priest, and I eat the food hallowed in the name of Heaven if the Temple remains standing. But you are a Gibeonite, as it is written [here], “who was from Gibeon.” And you will be a slave to me, chopping wood and drawing water (Pesikta Rabbathi 27:4, Yalkut Shimoni ad loc.). But Moreh Zedek who did not explain, adopted the reason of our Sages (Sotah 41b) who learned from here that whoever flatters a wicked man will ultimately fall into his hands or into the hands of his son or into the hands of his son’s son, for Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah seized him and brought him to prison.

Verse 7

<b>But, hearken now... The prophet who would prophesy for peace.</b> He said: I prophesy retribution. If it does not come, I am not a liar, for the Holy One, blessed be He, renounces the evil, but the prophet who prophesies for peace, etc., when the word of the prophet comes, etc., but if his word does not come, he is a liar, as it is said, “God is not a man that He should lie, etc.” (Num. 23:19). In this manner Rabbi Tanhuma (Vayera 13) expounded.

Rather, he died on the day preceding Rosh Hashanah and commanded his children to hurry him after Rosh Hashanah, but not before, and they should conceal his death on that day in order to make Jeremiah’s prophecy appear false.

Another explanation: נֹצְרִים is like “He keeps (נֹצֵר) lovingkindness” (Exod. 34:7), an expression of keeping.

Rabbah Proem 24) that the Patriarchs and the Matriarchs went to appease the Holy One blessed be He concerning the sin of Manasseh who placed an image in the Temple but He was not appeased. Rachel entered and stated before Him “O Lord of the Universe, whose mercy is greater, Your mercy or the mercy of a flesh and blood person? You must admit that Your mercy is greater. Now did I not bring my rival into my house? For all the work that Jacob worked for my father he worked only for me. When I came to enter the nuptial canopy, they brought my sister, and it was not enough that I kept my silence, but I gave her my password. You, too, if Your children have brought Your rival into Your house, keep Your silence for them.” He said to her, “You have defended them well. There is reward for your deed and for your righteousness, that you gave over your password to your sister.”

<b>whenever I speak of him</b> Every time that I speak of him. And the Midrash Leviticus Rabbah (2:3) explains: It is enough My speech (דַּי דִבּוּרִי) with which I endowed him, that I taught him My Torah, for Me to have mercy on him.

Verse 21

<b>Set up markers for yourself</b> Signs in the good ways of your ancestors.
<b>small palms</b> small palms (תְּמָרִים) planted for a sign on the way. And the simple interpretation of the verse is. Make signs to know the way you traversed from Eretz Israel to Babylon, so that you will return by that road; that is to say that you will surely return from there.
<b>the road upon which you went</b> The “kethib” is הָלָכְתִּי, “I went,” and everywhere that you went I went with you Jonathan, however, renders. place “tamrurim” for yourself: Pray with embittered spirit, deriving תַּמְרוּרִים from מַר bitter. (And Menahem [Machbereth p. 119] explained תַּמְרוּרִים as an expression of raising up, and so he explained וְתִמְרוֹת “raising of smoke” (Joel 3:3). In some editions, this is missing.)

Verse 22

<b>will you hide</b> will you hide from Me, that you are ashamed to return to Me because of your way? Behold, something new has been created on earth, that a woman shall go after a man to seek him that he should marry her. This is an expression of “and I will go around (וַאֲסוֹבְבָה) in the city; I will seek, etc.” (Song 3:2). And in the name of Rabbi Judah the Preacher I heard: A woman shall turn around to become a man. I gave you like a daughter, who receives a tenth of the property of her father, seven nations out of seventy. Ultimately, you shall take everything like a son, a male, who inherits everything.

This is the confirmation of the deeds to make the matter open and publicized lest the witnesses die, and our Rabbis explained this concerning a plain, open document and a folded one in Baba Bathra (160b).

Verse 12

<b>in the presence of Hanamel my uncle</b> And until now, he calls him “my uncle’s son.” Perhaps there were two. Otherwise, I do not know what it means. Some are inclined to say that Hanamel was both Jeremiah’s uncle and his uncle’s son; e.g. Reuben married the daughter of his brother Simon, and she bore him Jemuel, and Simon had already begotten Jamin. Hence, Jamin is Jemuel’s uncle, since he is his mother’s brother, and also his uncle’s son, since he is the son of Simon, Jemuel’s father’s brother. This is, however, not the method of expression, for we do not find anywhere in the Bible, that the mother’s brother is called an uncle.

How so? “And there was the cloud and the darkness, and it illuminated the night” (Exodus 14:20).

<b>If not My covenant, etc.</b> If it is possible that the covenant that I formed with day and night to be in their time should be abolished, and if it is possible for the statutes of heaven and earth to be abolished as though I had not placed them, also the seed of Jacob, etc. Our Sages, however, expounded it in regard to the covenant of the Torah and circumcision, to derive from here that because of them heaven and earth were created. But this Midrash does not fit the sequence of the verses.

They said to Ezekiel, ‘The slave of a priest whom his owner sold what is the ruling regarding whether he may eat of the priest’s due?’ That is to say, because they wanted to say that they should not be punished for infracting the commandment by returning the slaves.

(That is to say that they are ignited one from the other, like brothers, who benefit each other. Omitted in other editions.) And according to its simple meaning, it appears that it is a vessel upon which they kindle fire before the princes.

Verse 23

<b>three...verses</b> Our Rabbis (Moed Katan 26a) stated. This was the Scroll of Lamentations. They read before him, (1:1) “How...(:2) She weeps...(ibid. 3) Judah has been exiled...(ibid. 4) The roads of Zion are mournful.” Despite all this, he was not troubled. He said, “I am the king over the survivors.” As soon as he read (ibid. 5), Her adversaries have become the head,” he said, “From now on, I am [no longer] the king.” Immediately, he rent it with a scribe’s razor.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>And Jeremiah was coming and going among the people</b> When Zedekiah assumed the throne, he gave an order and they freed him from the jail where Jehoiakim had imprisoned him, for Zedekiah was a righteous man and the people of his generation were wicked, whereas Jehoiakim was a wicked man and the people of his generation were righteous.

Verse 13

<b>and there was the captain of the guard</b> Appointed to guard so that no man should leave the city to make peace with the Chaldeans.
<b>the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah</b> That is Hananiah the son of Azzur. He was his grandson, and for the following reason Scripture traced his lineage, [viz.] to teach that whoever flatters a wicked man eventually falls into his hands or into the hands of his son or into the hands of his grandson, and Jeremiah flattered him, for he said to him, “Amen! (28:6) [So may the Lord do.] May the Lord fulfil your words” (Sotah 41b). And [according to] the Midrash Aggadah, Hananiah commanded his son, “See that I am dying because of Jeremiah, and he made me a liar in my prophecy. If you can cause him to stumble, cause him to stumble. And his son commanded his son also in that manner, and when the time came, he caused him to stumble.

<b>in the middle gate</b> Heb. בשער התוך. Jonathan renders: in the middle gate, the gate of the Temple court, the Nicanor Gate, the Eastern Gate, and it is between the gate of the Women’s Court and the gate of the Temple proper. And our Rabbis (Sanh. 103a) said: The gate where the halachoth were decided (מחתכים). Concerning them, Scripture says. “The place of judgment there is wickedness” (Ecc. 3:16).

Verse 4

<b>by way of the king’s garden</b> He had a cave from his house to the plains of Jericho, and he went out at night by way of the cave. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do to fulfill “And I will spread My net over him” (Ezek. 12:13)? He prepared a deer before the Chaldeans walking on the roof the cave outside the city, and they ran after it to seize it, and it ran up to the entrance of the cave, and they saw Zedekiah going out of the cave.

Verse 1

<b>The word that came</b> What is stated at the end of the section (42:7): “And it was at the end of ten days that the word of the Lord came etc.,” but he first wrote on account of what it was said to him. And the Midrash Aggadah in Lamentations Rabbah (Proem 34): What was the word? “And return to Gedaliah.” He said to him: Either you go down with them and I will remain (?) here, or you remain here and I will go down with them. He replied: If I go down with them, what will I help them? Rather, let their Creator go down with them, for He will help them exceedingly.

He would see a group [of youths] joined by a collar and would put his neck between them, etc., as is stated in Pesikta of the Haftarah Divrei Yirmiyahu (p. 113).

<b>in fetters</b> Heb. באזקים, ceps in French, fetters.

Verse 2

<b>“The Lord your God spoke”</b> Why are you troubled about them? Did you not prophesy to them and they did not hearken? As it is stated in Pesikta d’Rav Kahana (p. 113a).

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>I have released you</b> Heb. פתחתיך, an expression related to “And he untied (ויפתח) the camels” (Gen. 24.32). And so did Jonathan render: Behold, now I have untied you. But Menahem (p. 147) interpreted all of them as an expression of actual opening (פתיחה).

Verse 5

<b>But he would still not return</b> Despite this, he did not wish to return. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “And return to Gedaliah,” who was appointed over the remaining poor people. They, too, need you, like the rest of the exiles.

<b>And you seek great things for yourself?</b> [“Great things” means] prophecies. Cf. “Please tell me all the great things etc.” (II Kings 8:4). “Call to me...and I will tell you great, etc,” (above 33:3). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: If there is no vineyard, there is no fence, and if there are no sheep, there is no shepherd. I reveal Myself to the prophets only in the merit of Israel. We learned this in the Mechilta, in the beginning.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>a mighty man has stumbled upon a mighty man</b> When they were fleeing they would stumble over each other.

Verse 13

<b>concerning the coming of Nebuchadnezzar</b> This was a second blow, [viz.] that Nebuchadnezzar laid Egypt waste in the twenty-seventh year of his reign (Ezek. 29:17), as we learned in Seder Olam (ch. 26).

Verse 14

<b>“Stand fast and prepare yourself”</b> for the war. והכן means “and prepare.”

Verse 15

Menahem (Machbereth p. 126) classified it as an expression of complete destruction, and so did he classify מטר סחף. Dunash, however, interprets מטר סחף like מטר סועף, cutting rain. Cf. “Lops off (מְסָעֵף) the branches with a saw” (Isa. 10:33).

Verse 16

<b>He made many stumbling blocks</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, Who pushed him down, made many stumbling blocks for him.

<b>Its voice shall go like [that of] the snake</b> The “snake” comes to teach us about Egypt but ends by learning. For we learn from here that when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to the serpent, “You shall walk on your belly” (Gen. 3:14), He severed his feet, and his voice went to the end of the world. So we learned in the ‘Thirty-two Methods of Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Jose the Galilean’ (Method 12).

Verse 26

Verse 28

So did Jonathan render it. (See Isaiah 17:2, Commentary Digest.) But Menahem (Machbereth Menahem p. 137) explained כּערוער as the name of a tree of the forest trees.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>Give wings to Moab</b> Heb. ציץ. Give wings to Moab. Every appendage that hangs or protrudes from man or beast is called ציץ. Cf. “And it shall be to you for fringes (לציצית)” (Num. 15:39); “And He took me by the locks (בציצית) of my head” (Ezek. 8:3).

<b>O villages of Rabbah</b> Rabbah of the children of Ammon.
<b>and mobilize in companies</b> Heb. והתשוטטנה בגדרות. Jonathan renders: ואתהמכוּן בסיעָן, mobilize in companies. He interprets והתשוטטנה as an expression of armies that run to and fro (משוטטים) ; and גדרות is an expression of sheepcotes full of flocks, and can be interpreted as “and roll in the dung of the sheepcotes,” an expression of contempt. [Onkelos translates:] “And Esau despised” (Gen. 25:34), ושט עשו.

Verse 4

<b>You boast</b> Heb. תתהללי (vanter in French).
<b>about the valleys?</b> That your land is a land of valleys and lack of rainfall is not harmful to it since the sun does not penetrate into it.
<b>Your valley is flowing</b> A misfortune of an overabundance of rain shall come upon it until the water will flow in the valley and inundate the roots of the grain So did Menahem [Machbereth Menahem p. 77] explain it.

Verse 9

<b>If vintagers have come upon you, etc.</b> I have exposed Esau, etc. I have heard tidings, etc. On this order, Obadiah prophesied concerning Edom, but since one watchword is passed to many prophets, but no two prophets prophesy under the same watchword, they differ in several words.
<b>will they not leave over gleaning grapes?</b> This is the interrogative. Yet the spoilers who came upon you left over nothing for you.

Verse 10

<b>I exposed</b> Heb. חשפתי, uncovered. Cf. “the exposure (מַחְשֹף) of the white” (Gen. 30:37). And you delivered the survivors of Israel in order that no one remain of them, as it is stated: “Neither should you have delivered his survivors” (Obadiah 1:14).

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>I have made you small</b> For they have no king who is the son of a king. It was not their custom to set up a king the son of a king.

Verse 16

<b>Your hastiness</b> Heb. תפלצתך, an expression of haste, for you hurried and were hasty to arouse your hatred for your brother. And there are some who translate this as an expression of fright (פַּלָצוּת), and there are some who translate it as an expression of an image (מפלצת).

<b>you who dwell</b> Heb. שכני, like שׁוֹכֵן.

Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>Hamath and Arpad are shamed</b> [Hamath and Arpad,] cities of Aram, [are shamed,] for they heard bad news concerning Damascus, which is the head of Aram, as it is stated. “For the head of Aram is Damascus” (Isa. 7:8). Therefore, they melted.
<b>there is worry in the sea</b> He compares her worry to the worry of the sea, which cannot be quiet. Every instance of דאגה, worry, is an expression of fear.

Verse 24

<b>Damascus become feeble</b> Her hands have become too feeble to wage war.
<b>trembling</b> Heb. רֶטֶט.

Verse 25

<b>“How was...not fortified”</b> It was not filled with earth around its wall to strengthen the wall. Cf. “And they fortified (ויעזבוּ) Jerusalem up to the wall” (Neh. 3:8). It can also be interpreted: Why was it not forsaken by this evil, that the evil should not come upon it?
<b>the city of my joy</b> So shall her king mourn over her.

Verse 37

<b>the allies</b> Heb. הערב. Jonathan renders: סוּמְכותא (garantie in French).

Verse 38

<b>and they are mad upon things of horror</b> Heb. יתהללו, they shall become mad. Another interpretation: (Pour vanter in French) in order to boast. And so did Jonathan render: משתבּחין, they boast, [i.e.,] with the gods of the giants that they had.

So did Jonathan paraphrase: Behold a king with his camp shall ascend upon them like a lion that ascends from the height of the Jordan. We learn that the height of the Jordan is a place of lions.
