Rashi on I Kings



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>But he was not warmed.</b> Our Rabbis said, “He who disgraces clothing will ultimately be deprived of their pleasures.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 62b.</i> [Dovid’s clothing did not warm him] because he tore off the corner of Shaul’s robe.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See I Shmuel 24:5.</i> The Midrash [Aggadah states], Rabbi Shmuel son of Nachmeni said, that as Dovid saw the angel standing in Yerusholayim with his sword drawn in his hand, his blood became cold from fear.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">That terror of that experience remained with Dovid, and from then on he could never again find warmth.</i>

Verse 2

<b>Virgin girl.</b> Her virginity warms her flesh.
<b>A warmer.</b> “A warmer,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Koheles 10:9.</i> and similarly, “and he who chops wood will be warmed [יסכן] by them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, סכנת means that she should be “near” to him.—Targum</i>

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>Was not intimate with her.</b> Because a virgin is more suitable for [the purpose] of warming than a non-virgin.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He therefore preferred that she remain a virgin.</i> But our Rabbis said [he was not intimate with her] because “He shall not have too many wives,”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 17:17. See Rashi there.</i> and he already had eighteen.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because Dovid already had eighteen wives, the maximum permitted for a king, he therefore did not marry her. See Maseches Sanhedrin 22a and Rashi there.</i>

Verse 5

<b>Exalted himself.</b> He elevated himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning is, “lifted himself.”</i>
<b>And fifty men.</b> Whose spleens had been removed, and whose soles of their feet had been carved.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 21b and Rashi there.</i>

Verse 6

<b>Had never angered him.</b> He did not anger him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Throughout his life, Dovid had never gotten angry at Adoniyahu or punished him when he did something bad. Adoniyahu therefore incorrectly assumed that his father would not reprimand him for proclaiming himself king.</i> This [episode] teaches you that he who refrains from rebuking his child causes his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishlei 13:24.</i>
<b>And he was also very handsome.</b> [He was as handsome] as Avsholom,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“He too,” infers that there was another individual who was also very handsome.</i> about whom it is written, “And as Avsholom there was no one as handsome.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 14:25.</i> This caused them to be proud.
<b>She gave birth to him.</b> [“She” refers to] his mother.
<b>After Avsholom.</b> I.e., his mother reared him in the same spoiled manner that Avsholom’s mother reared him.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi does not translate “<i>after</i> Avsholom” because it implies that she bore both Adoniyahu and Avsholom, which is not true, for Avsholom’s mother was Ma’acha, and Adoniyahu’s mother was Chagis.</i>

Verse 7

<b>With Yoav ben Tseruyah.</b> Because he knew that Dovid bore a grudge against him for having killed Avner, Amasa, and Avsholom; and that he would eventually charge his son, who would reign in his place, to deal with him. He [Yoav] therefore wanted that this one [Adoniyahu] should reign through his assistance so that he would favor him.
<b>And with Evyosor the <i>kohein</i>.</b> He was dismissed from the priesthood at the time when Dovid escaped from Yerusholayim on account of Avsholom, when he [Evyosor] consulted the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i> and was unsuccessful as it is stated, “And Evyosor went up.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 15:24.</i> He [Evyosor] was a descendant of Eili. And he knew that he would not serve in the days of Shlomo, for it was stated to Eili, “And I will appoint for Myself a faithful <i>kohein</i>... and he will serve before My anointed one...”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 2:35.</i> He [Evyosor] wanted that this one [Adoniyah become king] through his assistance.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">So that Adoniyahu would listen to him when he became king and would restore him to his previous position of Kohein Gadol.</i>

Verse 8

<b>And Noson the prophet.</b> Who prophesied to Dovid that Shlomo would reign, as it is stated in Divrei Hayomim, “ his name will be Shlomo.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayomim 22:9. The verse reads, “Behold a son will be born to you, he will be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies around, his name will be Shlomo.”</i>

Verse 9

<b>And fattened [oxen].</b> Oxen which are [fattened by being] fed forcefully.
<b>The stone of Zocheles.</b> A huge stone used by the young men to test their strength by moving or dragging it. An expression similar to “moving [זוחלין]”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Misnayoy Mikvaos 5:4,5.</i> water, or, “those that creep [זוחלי] on the earth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 32:24.</i> [Targum] Yonoson rendered [אבן זוחלת as] אבן סכותא [=a lookout stone], upon which people stand and look far into the distance.
<b>Ein-Rogel.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered [עין רוגל as] עין קצרא, which is [a well]<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">It was customary to anoint kings near a well or another source of running water to symbolize continuity and prolonged rule. See Rashi 1:33 below.</i> used by a clothes washer who would press the woolen clothes with his feet [=רגליו], by trampling [on them].

Verse 10

<b>And his brother Shlomo, he did not invite.</b> For he knew that the prophet had prophesied about him that he would reign.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>And you will save your life.</b> From the rivalry which will follow the death of the king, for your son will wish to reign, as the Holy One Blessed Is He, had promised him.

<b>Sinners.</b> [They will be] lacking<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, חטאים means “offenders.”</i> and restrained from any greatness,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, חטאים means “banished.”—Targum, or will be treated as sinners.</i> as in, “[Sling a stone] at a hair, and not miss [יחטיא].”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 20:16.</i>

Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>Did you say.</b> In the interrogative.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “Did you say that Adoniyahu will reign after me?” Literally, “אמרת” means, “you said” [in the affirmative.]</i>

Verse 25

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b>On my personal mule.</b> This will be a sign that he will reign and the beginning of [his] greatness, because a commoner is forbidden to ride on the king’s horse.
<b>To Gichon.</b> [Gichon] is the well of Shilo’ach. From this [episode is derived the custom] not to anoint the kings except at the well, to symbolize thereby that his kingship shall continue on and on.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As the waters of a well do.</i>

Verse 34

<b>And he shall be anointed.</b> He places the oil between his eyelids in the form of a crown.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Horiyos 12a.</i>

Verse 35



Verse 36

<b>Amein.</b> [Long] live Shlomo.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">“Amein” serves as an affirmation to this proclamation.</i>

Verse 37

<b>Than the throne of my lord Dovid Hamelech.</b> From this [we derive] that a father is not envious of his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 105b.</i>

Verse 38

<b>And the archers and the sling shooters.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered, “the archers and the sling shooters.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, כרתי ופלתי refers to the Sanhedrin.—Ralbag</i> But our Rabbis maintained [that it refers to] the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Urim and Tumim are called “כרתי ופלתי”; כרתי because their words are “cut” [כרת], i.e., they render irrevocable decisions and פלתי because they are “wondrous” [פלא] in revealing the future. See Maseches Berachos 4a.</i>

Verse 39

<b>The horn of oil.</b> [Tzadok took] of the anointment oil compounded by Moshe.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Shemos 30, 31.</i>
<b>From the Tent.</b> Since the Holy Ark was in the City of Dovid [Yerusholayim], and the jug of oil of anointment was before the Ark. as we have learned in [Maseches] Yoma.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"> 52b.</i>

Verse 40

<b>The flutes.</b> <i>Flute</i> in O.F.
<b>And the earth [seemed to] split.</b> Prophets spoke in terms of exaggeration as [is common] among people.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">see Maseches Chulin 90b.</i>

Verse 50

<b>Of the horns [of the corners] of the Altar.</b> Which was in Givon.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, he grabbed on to the corners of the altar that was in Yerushalayim.—Radak. In those days it was permissible to build an altar and bring certain sacrifices outside of the Mishkan. </i> He said, “Those who are executed by Beis Din are buried in the graves of Beis Din. I will die here, and be buried in the graves of my forefathers.” Thus did Rabbi Tanchuma expound.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>[What] was done to me.</b> By showing them the letter which Dovid had sent through Uryah,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Uryah was one of Dovid’s generals. Dovid wanted Uryah killed so that he could marry Bas Sheva, Uryah’s wife. With Yoav’s assistance, he arranged to have Uryah placed in the front lines of the battle. When Uryah was killed, everyone blamed Yoav. Instead of protecting Dovid, Yoav betrayed him by disclosing that it was Dovid’s plan to place Uryah in the thick of the battle in order that he be killed.</i> [according to] the Midrash Rabbi Tanchuma.
<b>[And shed] the blood of war at a time of peace.</b> Since they were at peace with him, they were not on guard against him.
<b>On his belt which was on his loins.</b> He had girded his sword, attached to his loins, not in the customary manner of those girding swords, when he went out to meet Amasa. [He placed the sword’s] opening downward so that it would fall out, as it is stated, “and he went out and it fell out.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 20:8.</i> Once it fell, he [Yo’av] retrieved it. Amasa presumed that he retrieved it only to pick it up from the ground, and he did not guard himself from the sword which was in Yo’av’s hand.
<b>And in his shoe that was on his feet.</b> He killed Avner cunningly by asking him, “How does a woman who has no hands remove the shoes?”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">During חליצה, the widow must remove the shoe of her deceased husband’s brother who does not want to marry her.</i> as it is stated, “And Yo’av caused him to turn aside at the gate to speak with him בשלי.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 3:27.</i> [בשלי is] an expression of “remove [של] your shoes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 3:5.</i>

Verse 6

<b>And do not let his greying head go down to the grave in peace.</b> Do not let him die a natural death [causing him] to fall into <i>Gehinnom</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid had Yoav’s ultimate welfare in mind.</i>

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>An explicit curse.</b> [נמרצת<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">נמרצת is an acronym for the five ways that Shim’i cursed Dovid. He called Dovid an adulterer [=נואף], a Moavi [=מואבי], murderer [=רוצח], oppressor [=צורר], and an abomination [=תועבה]. See Maseches Shabbos105a.</i> means] concise, as in, “what will bring clarity [ימריצך] to you,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 16:3.</i> [and as in,] “and how clear [נמרצו are right words],”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 6:25.</i> the same as an interpretation [נמלצו]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">נמלצו is the equivalent of נמרצו because the ‘ר’ and the ‘ל’ are interchangeable.</i>.

Verse 9

<b>For you are a wise man.</b> Turn your attention to find for him a capital iniquity on account of another matter. This is [what it means by], “You will know how to deal with him.”

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>And his kingdom was firmly established.</b> [He was] also [ruler] over the heavenly creatures.

Verse 13

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>To speak to him.</b> To speak on his behalf, on behalf of Adoniyahu.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, on behalf of Shlomo, because she felt that Shlomo’s kingdom would be strengthened by granting Adoniyahu’s request.—Malbim.</i>
<b>For the mother of the king.</b> Our Rabbis said [this refers] to Rus the matriarch of kingship.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Bava Basra 91b and Rashi there. Rus was the great great grandmother of Shlomo who was still alive when Shlomo ascended the throne.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>Ask that the kingdom be given to him.</b> From the moment the scepter of the king is used, that is the beginning of authority.

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>And Who has made me a [royal] house.</b> A house of royalty as he had spoken through Noson.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>Go to Anosos.</b> He was from there.
<b>For you are deserving of death.</b> Because you rebelled against the kingdom of my father when you were with Adoniyahu, to appoint him king without his [i.e., my father’s] knowledge.
<b>Because you carried the Ark.</b> When my father was escaping from Avsholom.
<b>And because you suffered.</b> With him in that very same affliction, as it is stated, “for they said, ‘the people are hungry and weary and thirsty; in the wilderness.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 17:29.</i>

Verse 27

<b>That He had spoken concerning the house of Eili.</b> [As it is stated,] “And I will appoint for Myself a faithful <i>kohein</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 2:35.</i> [and] “and you will see a rival in My dwelling place, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 2:32.</i> Once [the Tabernacle at] Shilo was destroyed, there was no house worthy of service to the Holy One Blessed Is He, but now that the Beis Hamikdosh will be built, the Holy One Blessed Is He, fulfilled His word to banish Eili’s descendants.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Evyosor was Eili’s great great grandson. See I Shmuel 14:3, 22:20.</i>

Verse 28

<b>And the report reached Yoav.</b> The report of Dovid’s charge, that he had commanded to kill him, and he knew that Shlomo hated him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">That is why Yoav feared for his life. Alternatively, he heard of Adoniyahu’s death and of Evyosor’s banishment.—Radak</i> 
<b>For Yoav had sided with Adoniyah, but he had not sided with Avsholom.</b> At the end of the matter; however, he did seek to turn after him, but he was fearful that trace of Dovid[’s might] was still present.

Verse 29



Verse 30

<b>And he said, “No.”</b> Two [punishments] I will not accept upon myself. The curses that your father Dovid cursed me at the death of Avner, as it is stated, “They shall fall upon the head of Yo’av.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 3:29.</i> let Shlomo accept them upon himself, and afterward I will go.

Verse 31

<b>Do as he said.</b> I accept them [i.e., the curses] upon myself. Therefore, all these became attached to Dovid’s offspring. Uziyah became [a] leper,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 26:19.</i> Assa leaned on a staff,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See II Shmuel 3:29 and I Melochim 15:23.</i> Yehoyakim died by the sword,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Yirmiyahu 22:19.</i> and Tzidkiyahu lacked bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See II Melochim 25:30.</i>

Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b>In his own house in the wilderness.</b> For his home was unrestricted as a wilderness, to [help] the needy.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi in Maseches Sanhedrin 49a. Alternatively, Yoav had a house in the wilderness where his shepherds stayed when they were out with the sheep, or Yoav house was free of stolen property just like the wilderness.—Radak.</i>

Verse 35



Verse 36

<b>You must never go out from there.</b> In order that he be accessible to him and that he might find him guilty of a capital sin.

Verse 37



Verse 38



Verse 39



Verse 40



Verse 41



Verse 42

<b>And forewarned you.</b> An expression referring to a [legal] warning.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">A warning given to an offender before he or she commits the offense. </i>

Verse 43

<b>The oath of Adonoy.</b> Which I made you swear in the name of God.

Verse 44



Verse 45



Verse 46

<b>The kingdom was thus established, etc.</b> I.e., he was not punished for all these [actions].

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>Shlomo became the son-in-law.</b> As long as Shim’i, his teacher, was alive, he did not enter into marriage [with Pharaoh’s daughter]. From here, [our Sages derived and] declared, that a person should always live in the vicinity of his teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the juxtaposition of Shimi’s death and Shlomo’s marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter. See Maseches Berachos 8a.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In order to remain under his teacher’s guidance and influence.</i>
<b>Until he finished building, etc.</b> And afterwards he built a house for her.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, after he finished building the Beis Hamikdosh, Shlomo moved Pharaoh’s daughter out of the City of Dovid which had become sanctified by the presence of the Ark.—Radak</i>

Verse 2

<b>Sacrificed on improvised altars.</b> For the sake of Heaven, each [person] who so desired would build an altar on top of his roof or in his yard.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This was permitted during the period between the destruction of the Mishkan in Shilo and the construction of the Beis Hamikdosh. See Mishnayos Zevachim 14:7.</i>

Verse 3

<b>And Shlomo loved Adonoy, he conformed to the decrees of his father Dovid.</b> [During the first] four years, before beginning to build the Beis [Hamikdosh]. But once he began to build and Shlomo married Pharaoh’s daughter, consequently it states, “for as a provocation of anger and of fury has this city has been to me from the day that they built it until this day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 32:31.</i> Thus we learned in Seder Olam. We learn that the passages are not written in chronological order.
<b>Upon improvised altars he brought sacrifices.</b> The text discusses his dishonor, [this occurred] because he delayed the construction of the Beis [Hamikdosh] four years.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Shlomo desired to attain prophetic revelation by offering sacrifices.—Ralbag</i>

Verse 4

<b>For that was the great improvised altar.</b> That was the copper altar which Moshe made in the wilderness,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it was “great” because of its holiness.</i> and it was instituted in Shilo. Shilo was destroyed in Eili’s days, and then it came to Nov. Nov was destroyed in Shaul’s days, and they came to Givon.
<b>Shlomo offered.</b> Did Shlomo offer.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, יעלה means, “will offer.”</i>
<b>Upon that altar.</b> In one day.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>You preserved for him.</b> An expression of authenticating His words as in, “And Adonoy, your God will keep for you, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 7:12.</i> Here too You have preserved for him the kindness, You have authenticated Your words to fulfill to him the kindness which You had promised him through Noson the prophet.

Verse 7

<b>A small lad.</b> He was twelve years old. And this is how [his age] is calculated: “And he called his name Yedidyah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 12:25.</i> At the same time Amnon raped Tamar, as it is stated, “And it was after this, and Avsholom [the son of Dovid] had a sister.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 13:1.</i> At the end of, “two years, and Avsholom had sheep shearers,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. v. 23.</i> and he killed Amnon. Avsholom fled and went to Geshur, and he remained there three years,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. v. 38.</i> so we have five years. Avsholom then returned to Yerusholayim, “and [Avsholom] lived in Yerusholayim two years,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 14:28.</i> so we have seven [years in the life] of Shlomo. And he [Avsholom] rebelled against his father and was killed. After this, [it states], “And there was famine in the days of Dovid [for] three years,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 21:1.</i> so we have ten [years]. In the eleventh [year] he counted the [Bnei] Yisroel, “and they scattered in all the land,”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 24:8.</i> nine months. In the year of his death he instituted divisions as it is stated, “In the fortieth year of Dovid’s reign they were sought,”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayomim 26:31.</i> so we have twelve [years in the life] of King Shlomo.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Other, including Abarbanel, suggest that Shlomo may have been around twenty years old at the time. The fact that he is referred to as a “lad ]=נער]” is not necessarily a reflection of his age, for in Bereishis 44:22, Binyomin is described as a “lad [=נער]”at the age of thirty.</i>

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>This great people of Yours.</b> Since they are many, they have many dealings, and they come to litigate and I have no time to deliberate over their arguments. Another interpretation of, “for who is able to judge this great people of Yours,” their legal decisions are very difficult [for me to make]. If a lawsuit comes before me between two non-Jews, and I take from one and give to the other unjustly, I will not be punished. But [if a lawsuit comes before me] between Jews [and I take from one and give to the other unjustly], I will be punished for it with capital punishment,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">That is why Shlomo refers to the Bnei Yisroel as a “weighty [=כבד] nation.”</i> as it is stated, “And He takes the lives of those that steal from them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei 22:23.</i>

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>And if you will go in My ways, etc., I will lengthen your days.</b> The wealth and the honor for which I did not impose any conditions in my Torah to give to the king, I will give you whether deserving or not. However, [to attain] longevity and [continuation of] the monarchy for [future] generations, I have already imposed conditions in my Torah, “that he shall not turn aside from the commandment [etc.,] so that he may prolong days over his kingdom, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 17:20.</i> and that condition I will not alter. So, “if you will go in My ways...I will lengthen, etc.” and likewise concerning [the continuation of] the monarchy to his descendants, He said to him, “As for you, if you walk before Me, etc., no man [descendant] of yours will be cut off, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Below, 9:4, 5.</i> Thus is it learned in Sifrei, Rabbi Chanina the son of Gamliel says, “Behold he has said, ‘both wealth and honor, etc.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 13.</i>

Verse 15

<b>Shlomo woke up and behold it was a dream.</b> And behold he understood that his dream was true. He heard a bird chirping and understood its language, a dog barking and he understood its language.
<b>And [he] made a feast.</b> Out of his heart’s happiness [he celebrated] because he realized that his dream was true.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo celebrated his newly acquired wisdom. Rabbi Elazar said that from here we derive the custom of making a festive meal [e.g., siyum] to honor the completion of reading the Torah or studying a Masechta. See Shir Hashirim Rabboh 1:9.</i>

<b>Scribes.</b> To write the [king’s] chronicles.
<b>The secretary.</b> [To record] which legal case came before him first that he might rule on it first.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he was a court administrator.</i> Thus have I heard.

And in Kislev the third ten thousand would go out to Levanon, and these [second ones] would return to their home[s]. And in Teiveis the first ones go out and return to Levanon, and thus they would continue the cycle, which resulted that each ten thousand among them spent one month in Levanon and two months at home.

Verse 29

<b>Seventy thousand men who carried loads.</b> To bring the stones from the mountain to the city, and there were [an additional] eighty thousand who quarried them from the mountain, totaling one hundred fifty thousand [workers]. And they were all proselytes who were drawn, [i.e.,] they converted because of Shlomo’s greatness and his hospitality. And it is likewise written in Divrei Hayomim, “And Shlomo counted all the proselytes and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand.

<b>Chief officers.</b> The oppressors and overseers over those who did the work.
<b>Three thousand three hundred [officers].</b> And in II Divrei Hayomim it says, “[three thousand] and six hundred.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> It is my opinion that three thousand three hundred men were in charge of one hundred fifty thousand, so that each one was in charge of slightly over forty-five, and the three hundred that were added in Divrei Hayomim were in charge of all of them, so that each was in charge of a little more than five hundred. And you should know that there are two additional passages regarding this matter, that contradict each other. For [further on] in this book it states, “These were the supervising officers that oversaw the work for Shlomo, [there were] five hundred and fifty [of them],”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 9:23.</i> and in Divrei Hayomim it says, “two hundred and fifty.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 8:10.</i> These are four verses contradicting each other. But we may explain that those that are in the latter verses<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 9:23 and II Divrei Hayomim 8:10.</i> are referring to those who were in charge of all of them. And Shlomo had employed these proselytes to be bearers of burdens to hew stones in the mountain. He had the remaining workers for the store cities who were native born [Jews], because these passages are stated there.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In II Divrei Hayomim the passages discuss the store cities.</i> However, in the book of Melochim he counted the proselyte officers in two separate totals. [First was the total of] the officers who were in charge of forty-five men each, separately, and he combined<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In I Melochim 9:23.</i> the three hundred superior officers with the two hundred and fifty men who were in charge of the builders of the store cities and total together five hundred and fifty officers. And in II Divrei Hayomim he counted all the proselyte officers separately, the more important together with the less important, three thousand six hundred [men], all were proselytes. And the officers [in charge of the workers] in the store cities who totaled two hundred and fifty Jews, he counted separately.
<b>Who controlled the people that did the work.</b> The taskmasters over the people who did the work.

Verse 31

<b>And they brought.</b> From the mountains; an expression of uprooting.
<b>Heavy stones.</b> Heavy.
<b>Hewn stone.</b> Carved and chiseled. And if you ask, it has already been stated, “Neither hammer nor axe [nor any iron tool] was heard in the Beis Hamikdosh, during its construction.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Below 6:7.</i> The explanation is, that no iron was heard in the Beis [Hamikdosh], while it was being built, but they would chisel on the outside, and bring in and build [it] inside.

Verse 3

<b>The entrance hall along the front.</b> In front of the entrance to the Sanctuary. 
<b>[Twenty <i>amohs</i>] long along the front of the width of the Beis Hamikdosh.</b> The length of the entrance hall was along the width of the Sanctuary, from north to south. All larger measurements are referred to as the length, and the lesser are referred to as the width. Since in the Sanctuary, the measurement from east to west was greater,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It measured 40 <i>amos</i> versus 20 <i>amos</i> from north to south.</i> it was called the length, but since the entrance hall’s measurement from north to south was greater,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It measured 20 <i>amos</i> versus 10 <i>amos</i> from east to west.</i> [that which is] called the length, [is the measurement] from north to south and [the measurement] from east to west was called the width.
<b>Along the front of the house.</b> Was in front of the house on the eastern side, on the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it was in addition to the 60 <i>amos</i> mentioned in v. 2 above.</i>

Verse 5

<b>A chamber.</b> <i>Apentec</i>, in O.F. It has three names, יציע' תא' צלע, thus is this explained in [Maseches] Bava Basra.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> 61a.</i> 
<b>Around the walls of the Beis Hamikdosh circling all around.</b> I.e., against the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies, which is the דביר, he made chambers on the outside at the south, west, and north. And the end of the verse explains its beginning. “He built against the wall of the Beis Hamikdosh, [meaning] near the wall of the Beis Hamikdosh, a chamber round about. How did he make it? “Against the walls of the Beis Hamikdosh, [i.e., against] the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies, he made chambers.”
<b>And he made.</b> He made. And similarly, “He was [ויהי] my salvation,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 15:2.</i> means the same as “He was [היה] my salvation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The word ‘יהי’ is in the future tense but the ‘vav’ converts it [="ו" המהפך] to the past tense.</i>

Verse 6

<b>The bottom chamber.</b> One each side there were three [tiers of] chambers, one on the other. The measurement of its length is not stated here, but in Maseches Midos<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> 4:3.</i> we learned that there were thirty-eight chambers, fifteen in the north, five on top of five and five on top of them, and the same was in the south. And eight in the west, three on top of three and two on top of them. The bottom ones were five [<i>amohs</i> wide] and the middle ones six, and the top ones seven. Why? Because he made depressions in the wall of the house round about on the outside. The height of the chamber was five <i>amohs,</i> and as the height of the wall of the Sanctuary reached five <i>amohs,</i> he decreased its thickness and recessed it one <i>amoh</i> inward, and on that recess he placed the ends of the beams of the roof at the top of the chamber which served as the floor of the middle one. And as the wall reached [the height of] ten [<i>amohs</i>], he recessed it [another] <i>amoh</i> to place the ends of the beams of the roof of the middle [chamber] which served as the floor of the upper [chamber]. Thus we find the middle [chamber] is wider than the lower one by one <i>amoh</i>, and the upper [chamber] is wider than the middle one by one <i>amoh</i>.
<b>So that [the beams] would not be attached to the walls of the Beis Hamikdosh.</b> In order that the ends of the beams do not attach [to the walls] through perforations in the walls of the house, since this deteriorates the wall and it diminishes its beauty.

Verse 7

<b>When [the Beis Hamikdosh] was being constructed it was built of whole stones carried [from the quarry].</b> As it was removed from the mountain, through the worm [=a שמיר],<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishnayos Avos 5:6.

<b>Hammer.</b> <i>Delutta</i>, in Russian.

Verse 8

<b>The entrance of the bottom chamber was in the right side of the house.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered תיכונה as the “bottom,”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It cannot mean the middle story because you would not have an entrance to a building that is one story above ground level.</i> and not as “between” the upper and lower [ones], because the five chambers on the southern side had an opening to the outside in the bottom story. And this (is the meaning) “and by a winding stairway they went up to the middle [chamber].”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Thus indicating that תיכונה was the “bottom” story.</i>
<b>The bottom.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered “the middle,” because these chambers were not open to the outside. There were three openings to each. Thus is this taught in Maseches Midos,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> 4:3.</i> “One was to the chamber on the right and one was to the chamber on the left and one to the chamber above.” And it teaches us here that one of the lower [chambers] on the southern wall had an opening to the outside and through that opening<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The southern side is called the “right” side, because a person standing inside the Beis Hamikdosh at its entrance and looking out would be facing east and the southern side would be to the right.</i> they entered all the chambers. And the “middle chamber” of the verse, is not the middle one between the upper and the lower [ones], but the middle one of the five chambers on the southern side which had an opening to the outside in the bottom story. And this is the meaning of, “and by a winding stairway they went up to the middle [chamber],” which was above it, signifying that the תיכונה chamber was below.
<b>And by a winding stairway.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered, a winding staircase [=מסיבתא], and that is called in our language [O.F.] <i>vis</i>, and in German, <i>vindelstein</i>, and the commonly used name is <i>schvindel stieg</i>. It is a structure of stone pillars made [in the form] of many stairs, and one who goes on them is likened to one spiraling around a column, ascending many <i>amohs</i> on it without needing the inclination of an ordinary ladder, because its spiral serves as its incline.
<b>To the third.</b> [שלישים means the same] as to the third [=שלישיים]

Verse 9

<b>And [he] covered.</b> An expression of a ceiling covering. 
<b>With decorated boards and connected planks of cedar.</b> [There were] two ceilings, the one made for beauty was below, and the one of cedar planks was above; that of paneling was the lower one. And [Targum] Yonoson rendered [גבים as] בהנתוכין, but I do not know what they are. I heard in the name of Rabbi Menachem, blessed be the memory of the righteous, that they are boards woven beautifully in the form of a design, and it is called in our language [O.F.] <i>celed</i>, and in German, <i>gehimmelt</i>, and that is an expression of “heavenly,” [meaning] the highest part of the beam. But I say, they are hollowed bricks, and they are like half a round reed, which are used as coverings for houses. (In German, <i>dek</i> <i>tzigel</i>.)
<b>Paneling.</b> In Aramaic it is גובתא דקניא which were (above) and the planks (below).
<b>And connected planks.</b> Planks of cedar arranged above the paneling upon which they walk when they go up to repair the building. And similarly, [Targum] Yonoson rendered ושדרות בארזים as, “above them (i.e., the paneling) was an arrangement of a succession [דרכפת] of cedar wooden planks,” and “&amp;רכפת“ is an expression of a succession, comparable to, “clouds of heaven,”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 22:12.</i> which [Targum] Yonoson rendered, “a succession [=מריכפת] of light clouds.”

Verse 10

<b>Five <i>amohs</i> high.</b> Of each one. Therefore, their total height was fifteen <i>amohs</i> besides the thickness of the ceiling.
<b>And he covered the Beis Hamikdosh.</b> That is the upper covering of the roof, and the covering [=והספון] mentioned above that was the ceiling of the upper story.

<b>The cedar of the inside of the Beis Hamikdosh was carved with designs.</b> This means, that those cedar boards which he made for the inside of the building to cover the stone walls, were carved with figured carvings and forms of fragments resembling knobs; פקעים are <i>imosjjls,</i> in O.F.

The length of the wings covered part (of the poles’ width) since the Ark’s length was set to the width of the Temple, and its poles were protruding at the entrance of the Holy of Holies into the curtain which was at the entrance. Its poles were set at the ends of the Ark’s length, in order that two <i>Leviyim</i> should be able to enter between them, when they were carrying it in the wilderness.

Verse 24

<b>It was ten <i>amohs</i> from one end of its wings to the [other] end of its wings.</b> When they are spread, the wings of both [cherubs], which touched one another, filled the entire space of twenty <i>amohs</i>; and the bodies of the cherubim are not included in the measurement, and stood miraculously.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Bava Basra 99a. Alternatively, the wings were attached to the cherubs in such a way that the two wings of each cherub touched each other without any space between them. Thus a miracle was not necessary.—Radak.</i>

Verse 27

<b>The wing of one touched the wall.</b> The north[ern wall].
<b>And the wing of the second <i>cherub</i> touched the other wall.</b> The southern [wall]; they covered the Ark and its poles.
<b>And their wings which were inside the chamber.</b> The tips of the wings which were [towards] the center of the room.
<b>Were touching wing to wing.</b> Because the entire space of the room [i.e., the Holy of Holies] was twenty [<i>amohs</i>].

<b>The lintel.</b> These are the lintels [=אילי] of the entrance, these are the doorposts from each side that were made round, similar to אילים,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 40:21.</i> איליו,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 40:9.</i> ואילמיו<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 40:10.</i> (other texts: אלה' ואלון), and similarly in all of Yechezkeil’s structure[s],<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See Ibid. 40.</i> the doorposts at the entrance are called אילים.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi Ibid. 40:9.</i>
<b>The door-posts.</b> [The door frame consisted of five parts.] The threshold is one, and the side posts on each side are two, totaling three, and the lintel which is on it was made in two, like this. Thus have I heard.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, it was the fifth of a series of doorways of the Beis Hamikdosh encountered by one entering from the outside.—Ralbag.</i> But I say, מזוזות חמישית [refers to the] five sides that each of the door posts had, and it was not four-sided; and [the verse] is speaking neither about the threshold nor about the lintel, because we find neither the threshold nor the lintel called “אילים.”

Verse 32

<b>He hammered upon the <i>cherubim.</i></b> He spread the gold in thin sheets [in order] to sink them into the engraved forms, so that it be recessed into the engraved places and protrude on the protrusions, so that the gold does not ruin the figures, and so that the figures in the wood are distinguishable under the gold.

Verse 33

<b>Consisting of four parts.</b> The side posts [i.e., the entire door frames] of the Sanctuary were square, and so did [Targum] Yonoson translate, “from their four sides squared.”

Verse 34

<b>And two doors.</b> Each [door] was half the width of the entrance.
<b>Two [rounded] hinges.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered “two hinges,” an upper hinge and a lower hinge.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, צלעים means “sides,” i.e., both the inner and outer sides of the doors were overlaid with carvings.—Radak.</i>
<b>Rounded.</b> [Targum Yonoson rendered,] oval.
<b>Two [rounded] hinges.</b> Also this is rendered [by Targum Yonoson] “hinges.” The expression קלעים, I maintain, is of Aramaic derivation, an expression meaning “entrance,” because the hinge enters into the cavity of the threshold.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, קלעים are curtains, meaning that the doors folded in the same manner a curtain does.</i>

Verse 35

<b>And he carved upon them <i>cherubim.</i></b> On the doors.
<b>Fitting precisely upon the carvings.</b> The gold was fitted onto the carved forms; recessed in the place of its engraving, and protruding in its place of protrusion so that the carved forms are [clearly] distinguishable [in the gold overlay].

Verse 36

<b>The inner court.</b> This was the court of <i>Kohanim</i> and the court of Yisroel, and it was [located] before the entrance hall, yet he calls it “the inner one” because it was inward of the women’s court. (In the Biblical text we do not find written “עזרת” except for in the Mishnah.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishnayos Midos 2:5,6.</i>)
<b>And a row of cut cedar beams.</b> A tier of (cut) beams made [part of] the wall.

Verse 2

<b>The house of the Forest of Lebanon.</b> [Targum] Yonoson translated, “a house for the cooling of kings.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, it is called “the house of the forest” because the house was constructed with many wooden pillars which gave it an appearance of a forest; or the house was actually located in the forest of Levanon.—Metzudas Dovid.</i>
<b>And cut beams of cedar.</b> Beams of cedar were along the length of the house. There was a row of columns on the ground and the cut beams from column to column.

Verse 3

<b>It was covered with cedar.</b> A ceiling over it from above.
<b>On top of the boards.</b> The upper partitions which were on the cut [beams]. Four partitions, one next to the other along the width and extending along the length of the house. Each had openings and windows, because this was a summer home made for air. And on those partitions was the covering of the ceiling. The ceiling was [made] of forty-five boards, three rows of boards (for the three spaces) between the four rows of columns, fifteen boards to each row (i.e., fifteen of them were placed in each space). Their length was along the width of each row and their width was along the length of the house, one next to the other.

Verse 4

<b>There were three rows of windows.</b> He also made another covering near the three rows of boards and the three rows of lintels,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi שקפים are lintels. But Radak’s opinion is that שקפים were look-out windows, as in 6:4 above.</i> because the width of fifteen boards did not cover the house in its entire length which was one hundred <i>amohs</i>. And he made near it to cover the house, a covering of small boards placed on small beams which were left (should read “placed”) from one row of [the long] cut beams to the other, three small beams one next to (should read “at the end of”) the other, and lintels on both their sides, similar to a lintel against which the door strikes. And on those lintels the ends of the small boards were placed, the length of the small boards opposite the width of the larger boards which he installed first.
<b>And each window faced the other window.</b> The ends of the boards of this lintel were opposite (the ends of) the boards of this one (lintel).
<b>Window.</b> An expression of “an edge,” and so did Menachem interpret it and he related it to, “to their desired boundary [מחוז],”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 107:30.</i> and every “חזית” in the language of the Mishnah is thus, [as] in the order of arranging the daily sacrifice,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishnayos Tamid 2:4.</i> and also “he should made (a ledge) from the outside,” in the chapter of “The Partners” in [Maseches] Bava Basra.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> 2a.</i> [Targum] Yonoson also, rendered this, “a projection opposite a projection,” but “שקופים אטומים”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Above 6:4.</i> and likewise, “רבועים שקף,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 5.</i> he translated them all “beams.”

Verse 5

<b>And all the entrances and doorposts.</b> Because, generally, a king’s [summer] home is made with many entrances because of the air, and it was therefore called “a forest house” because it was like a forest.
<b>Were square as was the window.</b> [Targum] Yonoson translated, “square and covered the beams,” [i.e.,] the entrances were covered with thin boards, that were square as other entrances of houses, and they were not made with a curved arch similar to the entrances of a great hall.
<b>And each window faced [the other window].</b> And the front of one edge was installed facing the other edge. The top of the board was towards the top of the other board, three times for each beam, but I do not know how.

Verse 6

<b>An entrance hall of columns.</b> He made an entrance before these columns as an entrance to the house. Its length was fifty <i>amohs</i> along the width of the house, which was fifty <i>amohs</i>, and thirty <i>amohs</i> its width before the extent of the length of the house, only that the longer measurement is always called the length and the shorter one is called the width.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “length” and “width” are relative to the structure being described. See Rashi 6:3 above.</i>
<b>There was [another] entrance hall above them.</b> He made a high entrance [around] the entire house.
<b>And columns and support beams upon them.</b> And on the cut beams of cedar which were on the lower columns he erected on (should read “additional”) columns and beams from column to column, the columns to connect boards from one to another, and the beams for the ceiling. “עב” is a beam [=מריש], as we learned, “And the עבים, these are the beams.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Bava Kamma 67a.</i>

Verse 8

<b>His house where he dwelt.</b> A complete residence to eat and sleep there.

<b>And a line of twelve <i>amohs</i> was the circumference of the second [each] column.</b> This teaches [us] that it was four <i>amohs</i> by four <i>amohs</i> in diameter, because every circumference of three hand-breadths has a diameter of one hand-breadth.

<b>Branches designed like net [mesh] work.</b> The nets which they had were similar to a type of head covering which is called <i>cofea</i> [in O.F.].

<b>To cover the crowns that were on top of the pomegranates.</b> [The text of] this verse is in a disarranged order.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the verse can be explained according to its literal translation.

And the four wheels of the base had frames on this side and frames on the other side, on all four sides; between one and the other, was a width of four <i>amohs</i>, and above there were “blocks [=סרנים which means] the same as “boards” [=נסרים], against the frames, and the ledges were from the lower [frames] to the upper ones, and there were other frames between the ledges, like the design of the legs of the bed of villagers which are not round but protrude [in order] to decorate them with lions and cherubim. But I say, that these ledges were like the rungs of a ladder, sort of copper rods standing on the lower frames, there were two or three rods. The frames were set between one rod and the other, connected from one ledge to the other. [Targum] Yonoson, also, rendered “ledges.”

Verse 29

<b>And on the frames that were between the rungs.</b> Were decorated with forms of lions, oxen and cherubim.
<b>And on the rungs there was a base.</b> A base, to place the basin upon it, above the frame which was on their top.
<b>And beneath the lions and oxen.</b> Which were embroidered or attached on the outer frames which were between the ledges.
<b>Joined together.</b> לויות is form resembling a male and female embracing.
<b>Thin strips of metal.</b> Hammered, resembling the hammering of a thin metal plate. They did not protrude in its thickness nor were they engraved in a depression. And Yonoson rendered לויות מעשה מורד, “joined by welding,” <i>souldriz,</i> in O.F.

Verse 30

<b>Four [copper] wheels.</b> Two in the front and two in the back in the manner of large wagons.
<b>And copper bars.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered ונסרין דנחש, “boards of copper,” they are the upper boards against the frames.
<b>Bars.</b> [סרני means] the same as נסרים [=boards].
<b>And its four corners.</b> Of the base [=כן]which was above them [i.e., wheels].
<b>Had shoulders.</b> They protruded above the boards in the corners of the base. And under the basin which rested upon the base, the shoulders were molten. (Other texts: This teaches [us], that the shoulders came from the base in one pouring, and the shoulders supported the basin so that it should not fall down through the base.)
<b>At the side of each were thin metal strips joined together.</b> At the side of each of the shoulders was a joining of a decorated male and female. מעבר איש [=one to another] means the same as “איש אל אחיו [=one to another],”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 25:20.</i> which is stated by the cherubim.

Verse 31

<b>And the rim of the vessel was inside the crown and rose above it an <i>amoh</i>.</b> The mouth of the base extends outward of the rim of the crown and goes upward an <i>amoh</i> high. The crown is the roof of the base, made like a hat, [i.e.,] sloping on all sides, and in the center a round hole was set, with a diameter that was one and one half <i>amohs</i>, and around that hole was the resemblance of an enclosure of a partition one half <i>amoh</i> high around.

This is what is stated here, “And the rim of the vessel was inside the crown and rose above it an <i>amoh</i>.”
<b>The rim was round made like the base.</b> And the rim of the crown was round, a replica of the base which was round.
<b>One and a half <i>amohs</i>.</b> Its width in diameter.
<b>There were engravings on the rim as well.</b> Designs of flowers.

<b>Their rims.</b> They are the enclosures around, which bind them together.
<b>And their spokes.</b> The arms of the wheels which are attached from the holes of the wheel to the rims, which is called <i>rais</i>, in O.F.

Verse 34

<b>There were four shoulders.</b> As I have explained above, “and its four corners had shoulders,”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 30.</i> and he did not mention it here only to say, “the shoulders were of the base itself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they were not made separately and then attached to it.</i>

<b>And its frames. They were all of one piece.</b> The lower frames were poured together with it; he did not attach them afterwards.

Verse 36

<b>He engraved on the plates, on its axles, and on its frames.</b> On the lower ones. On both of them, he engraved and inscribed cherubim, lions.
<b>(And palm trees, this is not [found] in other texts.) Pairs attached to each other.</b> He engraved around the likeness of a male and female that are joined by their arms, thus our Rabbis explained this.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Yoma 54a.</i>
<b>Attached.</b> An expression of attachment, as a male that is attached to a female, and its meaning is, “a man with his attachment.” According to its simple meaning, לויות is an expression of “attachment,” <i>soldore</i>, in O.F. There were attachments there made as the joining of a man, and the joining was in the manner we explained.

<b>The sacred of his father Dovid.</b> That which remained of the silver and gold dedicated by his father.

And I heard from [Torah] scholars of Yisroel who said, because Dovid knew eventually it would be destroyed; so that the idol worshiping [nations] should not say that their idols are mightier for they took their revenge upon the Beis [Hamikdosh] which was built of the plunder and destruction which Dovid plundered from them. And others say, Shlomo said that there was a famine in the days of his father for three consecutive years, and he should have squandered these dedicated materials to sustain Yisroel’s poor.

<b>But not for all the days.</b> For in the days of the Mashiach, the kingdom will be restored to him.

The kingdom should have been restored, in Asa’s time, in the sixteenth year of his reign. However, he sinned by sending a bribe to the king of Aram, and did not depend on the Holy One Blessed Is He.

<b>To confirm.</b> [ויחלטו is] an expression of “confirmation.” They cut the word from his mouth so that he should not retract.

<b>In the seventeenth year of Yehoshofot.</b>  Some wonder about this verse, because it is stated concerning Achov that he reigned twenty-two [years],<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Above 16:29.</i> and concerning Yehoshofot it is stated, that he became king “in the fourth year of Achov,”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 41.</i> thus resulting that Achov’s [rule] ended in the nineteenth year of Yehoshofot[’s rule], but here it states that Achazyahu became king in the seventeenth year of Yehoshofot[’s rule]. However, I searched and found in Divrei Hayomim concerning the kings of Yisroel, that [Scripture] is not exact in the number of their years, and if one became king at the end of a year, he counts it at the beginning, but he does not count it elsewhere.  Therefore I say that, “in the fourth year of Achov,” that is mentioned in reference to when Yehoshofot became king, does not count with it Achov’s first year [of kingship]. And so you find in the majority [of cases]. Also, the year in which Yehoshofot became king is not included in these seventeen years.
