Rashi on Joshua



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>And after the death of Moshe.</b> This is connected to the chapter of the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The spirit of prophecy did not rest upon Yehoshua until the thirty day mourning period for Moshe was over. It was then that God began to speak to him and command him to begin the conquest of Eretz Yisroel. Yehoshua was in a state of sadness and the spirit of propecy does not rest upon a person who is sad. There are other <i>Seforim</i> in <i>Tanach</i> such as Ruth, Esther, Yonah that begin with the word וַיְהִי, and it was, that are not connected to any previous event. But here the beginning is definitely connected with the conclusion of <i>Sefer Devorim</i> where the death of Moshe is related.</i> which concluded with the passing of Moshe;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 34:5,6,7,8.</i> and this (Seifer Yehoshua) is connected to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 34:9.</i>

Verse 2

<b>Moshe, My servant is dead.</b> But if he were alive,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Rashi,</i> this is connected to what follows: Since he is dead, you must arouse yourself and cross this Jordan.</i> I would have wanted him [as the leader].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Metsudas Dovid,</i> Hashem said that if Moshe was still alive, you would be unable to cross the Jordon because of the decree preventing him from crossing the Jordon. See Bamidbar 20:12; Ibid 27:12,13.</i> Our Sages explain [that this passage is a reference] [to the three thousand laws that were forgotten] during the period of mourning for Moshe. Yehoshua then came and asked.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When the Bnei Yisroel realized that they had forgotten so many laws of the Torah, they came to Yehoshua and asked him to teach them the laws, but he too had forgotten many of them. He wanted Hashem to reveal those forgotten laws to him.</i> the Holy One blessed is He, said to him: “Moshe, My servant is dead, and the Torah is called on his name, which is like telling you that it is impossible.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Torah is referred to as תּוֹרַת משֶׁה, the Torah of Moshe, and Moshe is dead, these laws cannot be reenacted.</i> Go and burden them with battles.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">God told Yehoshua to get the people occupied with conquering the land. He told him to begin preparations to cross the Jordan and this would cause them to forget about the laws that were lost to them. This refers to the battles of conquest that were required to capture the land.</i>

Verse 3

<b>Every place upon which the sole of your feet will tread.</b> This is similar to what was said to Moshe. Regarding this, we learned in the <i>Sifre.</i> ‘If [this verse] is to teach us about the boundaries of Eretz Yisroel, the Torah has already stated:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 11:24.</i> From the wilderness and the Lebanon etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore we know the boundaries of Eretz Yisroel from the Torah.</i> If so, why is it said here: <b>Every place upon which the sole will tread?</b> This includes the lands outside Eretz Yisroel. After you have conquered the land, everything you conquer outside the land will be sacred and will belong to you.’

Verse 4

<b>From the wilderness and this Lebanon.</b> The wilderness refers to the wilderness of Kodeish, the wilderness of Tzin, which was adjacient to Edom which was to the south east, the direction from which they entered the land, as it is said: And behold we are in Kodeish.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 20:16.</i> How do we know that it was southeast? It is said: ‘Your southern flank will be from the <i>Tzin</i> wilderness along Edom.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 34:3.</i>
<b>To the great river, the Euphrates river.</b> This refers to its width from south to north. 
This includes all the land of the Chitim.
<b>To the Great Sea [westward].</b> This refers to its length from east to west.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>Be strong and courageous.</b> In the physical sense, as He states: “For you will lead this people to inherit the land.”

Verse 7

<b>Just be very strong and courageous.</b> This was said in reference to the Torah, as He states: ‘To preserve, to act in accordance with all the laws of the Torah.’ 
תַּשְּׁכִּיל—You will be successful.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">People consider that a successful person is a smart person. That is why the word תַּשְׂכִּיל—is associated with the word תַּצְלִיחַ. (<i>Metsudas Tzion</i>).</i>

Verse 8

<b>This Sefer Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This <i>Sefer Torah</i> implies a specific Book of the Torah. Which one? Thus <i>Rashi</i> comments that it refers to Sefer Devorim that was before Him.</i></b> The <i>Sefer Devorim</i> was before Him.
<b>And you shall meditate in it.</b> Every expression of הִגָיוֹן in the Torah refers to the [meditation] of the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Metsudas Tzion</i> says that הִגָיוֹן sometimes refers to speech as it is written: And my tongue will speak (תֶּהְגֶה) of Your righteousness (Tehillim 35:28).</i> as it is said, ‘And the thoughts of my heart before you;’<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 19:15.</i> ‘Your heart will give forth fearful thoughts.’<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 33:18.</i>

Verse 9

<b>I have already commanded you to be stong and courageous.</b> This was said in reference to actual war, as it is said: ‘Have no fear or trepidation.’ Where was he commanded this? He was so commanded in the time of Moshe, as it is said: ‘and command Yehoshua son of Nun etc.’<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 31:23.</i>

Verse 10

<b>And Yehoshua commanded.</b> He did this on the day that completed the days of mourning for Moshe.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Moshe died on the seventh day of Adar and he was mourned for thirty days. See Devorim 34:8.</i>

Verse 11

<b>Prepare your travel needs.</b> [Prepare] everything necessary for (traveling) and weapons for the [upcoming] battle, he said to them. You cannot say the צֵדָה refers to food and drink<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Metsudas Dovid</i> maintains that while they still ate of the <i>manna,</i> they bought other varieties of food from the non-Jewish merchants, and it was these foods that they were commanded to prepare.</i> for they had sufficient <i>manna</i> in their vessels to last them untill the sixteenth of Nissan, and so it is said:<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 5:12.</i> ‘The manna ceased on the morrow.’
<b>After three days.</b> At the end of three days. When you will have been here three days; then you will cross [the Jordan].

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>All who are mighty warriors</b> among you shall cross over armed [for battle].

Verse 15

<b>The sun rises.</b> Refering to the eastern side of the Jordan.

Verse 16



Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>Rebels</b>—who challenge your words.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>And Yehoshua sent.</b> I am forced to say that it was during the mourning for Moshe that he sent them, since at the end of three days following the conclusion of the mourning for Moshe, they crossed the Jordan, and it was from this fact that we learned that Moshe died on the seventh day of Adar, by counting back thirty three days from the day they came up from the Jordan which was the tenth day of the first month.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The month of Nissan.</i> And you must say that from the time the spies were sent they did not cross the Jordan until the fifth day, as it is said: they remained there three days until the pursuers returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See verse 22.</i> That same night they crossed [the Jordan] and came back to Yehoshua ben Nun. Yehoshua rose early that morning and they departed from Shittim.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3:1.</i> That was the fourth day. They spent the night there before crossing. Therefore they did not cross the Jordan until the fifth day.
<b>Secret.</b> In secret—this is the translation of <i>Targum Yonason.</i> He said to them: “Pretend to be deaf-mutes so they will not conceal their activities from you.” Another explanation: translate חֶרֶשׁ as חֶרֶשׂ or חֶרֶס, [חֶרֶס means pottery [in other words] “Load yourselves with pots in order to look like pottery salesmen.”
<b>And view the land and Yericho.</b> Wasn’t Yericho part of the land? Why then was it mentioned specifically? To indicate that it was as strong [fortified] as the entire land combined, because it was situated on the border. There are other such verses: Among the servants of David that were missing were nineteen men and Asaheil.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel, 2:30.</i> Wasn’t Asaheil included among the nineteen? [Why then was he mentioned specifically?] Because he was as strong as all of them. Another example: ‘And King Solomon was enamoured of many foreign wives and of Pharaoh’s daughter.’<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings, 11:1.</i> Wasn’t Pharaoh’s daughter included among them? Why then was she mentioned specifically? Because he loved her as much as all of them. And also because of the sin involved since she caused him to sin more than all of them. This was taught in Sifre.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar, 31:6.</i>
<b>A lady innkeeper.</b> According to <i>Targum Yonasson,</i> an innkeeper who sold various kinds of foodstuff.

Verse 2

<b>To scout.</b> To search, and similarly it is said: ‘There he searched for food.’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Eyov, 39:29.</i>

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>And she hid them.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The word וַתִּצְפְנוֹ  is singular but the verse is said regarding the two men and should be plural.</i> There are scriptural verses that speak of the plural as if it were singular. Since she was in a hurry to hide them and she hid them in a narrow place<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">She hid them in a place that normally would have sufficed for one person.</i> it was as though they were one person. The Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma states ‘That these two men were Pinchos and Caleiv, and Pinchos stood before them<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Before the pursuers.</i> but they did not see him because he was [invisible] like an angel.’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore there was no need to hide him and thus she actually hid only one man.</i> Another interpretation: She hid each of them separately.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore it is correct to say: she hid <i>him.</i></i> We find a similar verse: ‘Oil and incense gladden the heart’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei, 27:9.</i> and it does not say יְשַׂמְחוּ לֵב, in the plural.

Verse 5



Verse 6

<b>Stalks of flax.</b> with their pods.

Verse 7

<b>To the fords.</b> These were places for crossing the water,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">There were a number of crossing places linking both sides of the Jordan.</i> for the pursuers thought they had turned back to return to the plains of Moav and the Jordan was between them.
<b>And the shut the gate.</b> The gatekeepers shut the gate.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Metsudas Dovid</i> this refers to the gate of the city. The pursuers suspected that the spies were still in the city and by shutting the gates, they would be locked in and they would be able to find them.</i>

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>And there was no longer any spirit.</b> [The men had no spirit (desire)] even to lie with a woman. It was said by the Sages: There was no prince or ruler who had not had [sexual] relationships with Rochav, the harlot. She was ten years old when the Bnei Yisroel went out of Egypt, and she engaged in harlotry for forty years.

Verse 12

<b>A true sign.</b> You create the sign, so that when you come and capture the city, you will recognize the sign and keep me alive.

Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Then she lowered them down with the rope.</b> With the same rope and through the same window her admirers would use to come up to her. She said: “Master of the World with these I have sinned, with these forgive me.”

Verse 16

<b>Until the pursuers return.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">How could she possibly have known that the pursuers would be coming back after three days?</i> She must have had Divine inspiration to know they would return after three days.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Radak</i> maintains that she reasoned that it was a day’s journey from Yericho to the Jordan. They would spend a day searching for the spies and then return to Yericho making a total of three days.</i>

Verse 17

<b>We will be free.</b> We are holding you responsible for this, we depend on you to make this sign.

Verse 18

<b>The line of red string.</b> תִּקְוַת means a line or rope.

Verse 19

<b>His blood is on his own head.</b> The guilt of his killing is on his own head, for he will have caused his own death.
<b>His blood is on our heads.</b> The guilt of his killing will be upon us.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>And crossed over.</b> The Jordan river.

Chapter 3



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>And follow it.</b> This journey was different than other journeys. During Moshe’s lifetime, the Pillar of Clouds would head the procession, and show them the way, and the Ark<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The ark is here referred to as the Ark of the <i>Bris</i> or Covenant but it is also referred to in Scripture as the אַרוֹן הָעֵדוּת, the Ark of Testimony (see Chapter 4:16) because of the Two Tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments that were placed in the Ark.</i> would [first begin to] move after two divisions [lit. flags]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The twelve tribes of the Bnei Yisroel were divided into four divisions or units, three tribes to a unit. When they travelled in the wilderness, two divisions of six tribes would depart the camp, to be followed by the Ark: and the other two divisions would then follow the Ark. Thus the Ark was always amidst the Bnei Yisroel.</i> had left, but now the Ark would travel first.
<b>The <i>Kohanim,</i> the Levites.</b> Since they all descended from Levi who was the father of Amram, they [the <i>Kohanim</i>] are called Levites,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">While it is true that all <i>Kohanim</i> were Levites, the Levites were not <i>Kohanim,</i> because the <i>Kehunah</i> was confined to the descendants of Aharon.</i> as our Sages explain in <i>Breishis Rabbah,</i> ‘That there are forty eight places where the <i>Kohanim</i> are referred to as Levites.’

Verse 4

<b>But there must be a distance.</b> This was mandated out of respect for Hashem.
<b>And it.</b> [Even though the word וּבֵינָו is read as וּבֵינָיו ] [which usually indicates the plural] nevertheless here, <i>it</i> refers to the Ark. Similarly, ‘Yisroel will rejoice in its Maker.’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 149:2. In this verse too, the word בִעשָׂיו would seem to indicate a plural, yet it is singular, i.e., its Maker.</i> Another explanation: there were actually two Arks,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Accordingly the word וּבֵינָיו  correctly indicated a plural, i.e., the two Arks.</i> there Ark of the Divine Presence, and the Ark containing the bones of Yosef, which travelled together.
<b>Two thousand Amos.</b> To permit them to go and to pray before the Ark on Shabbos.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Two thousand <i>Amos</i> was the limit permitted for a Jew to walk outside his domain on Shabbos.</i> This is the explanation of Midrash Tanchumah, for Yehoshua knew that eventually they would beseige Yericho on Shabbos.
<b>So that you will know</b><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Certainly this cannot be the reason why they were commanded them to keep a distance from the Ark.</i> This refers to the last words of verse 3, “and follow it.”
<b>For you have never travelled this route.</b> You have never travelled in this fashion until now.

Verse 5

<b>And Yehoshua said.</b> This was on the third day, and the thirtieth day of mourning [for Moshe] was on the first of the three days.
הִתְקַדָשׁוּ usually means sanctify yourselves, but here it means prepare yourselves.
<b>For tomorrow</b> when you cross the Jordan.
<b>Wonders.</b> This translation follows that of <i>Targum Yonasan.</i>

Verse 6

<b>And Yehoshua said to the Kohanim.</b> He said this on the next day.
<b>Carry the Ark of the Covenant.</b> Until now it was carried by the Levites, but today it was to be carried by the <i>Kohanim.</i>

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>When you reach the edge of the waters of the Jordan.</b> When you enter within its edge.
<b>Remain standing in the Jordan.</b> Until all the people cross over to the other side [of the river.]

Verse 9

<b>Move closer.</b> He compressed all of them between the two poles of the Ark. This is one of the places where a small space was able to hold<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This was obviously a Divine miracle.</i> a large amount [of people.]

Verse 10

<b>With this you will know.</b> By virtue of actually seeing that all of you are compressed here.

Verse 11

<b>The covenant of the Master of all the earth.</b> The covenant of the Holy One, blessed is He, Who is the Master of all the earth. Do not wonder about the letter ה of the word הַבְּרִית<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It should have been written בְּרִית אָדוֹן, without the ה.</i> for there are many Scriptual words that are so constructed, such as: ‘הַמִסְגְּרוֹת הַמְכוֹנוֹת, the borders of the foundation.’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">II Malachim 16:17. It should have been written מִסְגְרוֹת הַמְכוֹנוֹת without the ה'.</i> הָעֵמֶק הַפְּגָרִים, the valley of the corpses.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmeyahu 31:39. It should have been written עֵמֶק הַפְגָרִים without the ה.</i>
<b>Will cross over before You.</b> It will go before you to enter into the Jordan.

Verse 12

<b>Take for yourselves twelve men.</b> Prepare them to be available to fulfil that which I will command them when you finally cross the Jordan.

Verse 13

<b>The waters that descend from above.</b> Coming down from the heights which is the way of all flowing rivers.
<b>And will stand in one massive mound.</b> As the water flows down to the place where it will be cut off, it will be unable to flow further downstream, but will be gathered and piled up, and grow higher, layer upon layer.
<b>Mound.</b> Similar to: ‘He gathers like a mound,’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 33:7.</i> ‘a mound of harvest.’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 17:11.</i> These are expressions of height, and so did Menachem connect them.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Menachem was an authority on Grammar often quoted by Rashi.</i>

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Its banks.</b> This is an expression of a high edge.
<b>During the entire harvest time.</b> The days of Nissan coincide with the harvest.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The crossing of the Jordan took place during the month of Nissan. <i>Metsudas Dovid</i> says this increase of the flood level of the Jordan naturally increased the magnitude of the miracle of its waters being cut off.</i>

Verse 16

<b>A great distance</b> from the place they stood. There the waters were cut off.
<b>From Odom.</b> [Adom] was the name of the city.
<b>Descended.</b> Those waters that had descended from above that had previously flowed downstream.
<b>Were completely cut off.</b> They continued flowing on their course<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to those waters that had flowed toward the Salt Sea before the cut off of the upper waters.</i> as do all the streams that flow into the sea, which ended their course.

Verse 17

<b>And the Kohanim remained standing.</b> They remained standing at the edge of the Jordan.
<b>In the midst of the Jordan.</b> So long as they remained standing, the upper waters did not descend below, and during this time all the people were crossing on dry land.
<b>Firmly</b> They were placed firmly, exactly opposite each other.

Chapter 4



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Twelve men.</b> These were the men mentioned previously,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi 3:12.</i> who were told to be prepared.

Verse 3

<b>And cross them over with you.</b> To fulfil the command of Moshe to build with them an Altar on Mt. Eivel, and to write upon them the words of Torah. On that same day they came to Mt. Eivel and built with them the Altar. They offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and they ate and drank. They then scraped the stones, and came and lodged in Gilgal.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Pass before the Ark.</b> Enter into the Jordan now and cross over until you are in front of the <i>Kohanim.</i>

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>And these stones will be</b> in Gilgal as a commemoration of this.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>Twelve stones.</b> These were different stones<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Obviously these were not the stones mentioned in the previous verse.</i> that Yehoshua set up in the midst of the Jordan.

Verse 10

<b>Until the the completion of everything.</b> This is as we learn in <i>Masches Sotah,</i> 34a: While they were standing in the Jordan, Yehoshua said to them, “You must know the purpose for which you are crossing the Jordan. It is on the condition that you drive away all the inhabitants of the land.”

Verse 11

<b>And it was when all the people had finished crossing and the Ark crossed.</b> The Ark did not cross as the others did, but in the manner explained below:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 18.</i> ‘The soles of the feet of the <i>Kohanim</i> were lifted and they were moved back to the dry land, on the bank from which they initially entered. They were standing next to it and the waters were returned to their course to flow as they did before. The result of all this was that the Ark and its bearers were on this side and all the Bnei Yisroel were on the other (lit. this) side. The Ark then lifted its bearers and crossed over.’
<b>In the people’s presence.</b> Before the eyes of the people.

Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>Command the <i>Kohanim.</i></b> Here is where Scripture explains what was mentioned before<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 11.</i> how the Ark of Adonoy and the <i>Kohanim</i> crossed in the people’s presence.
<b>Have them come up out of the Jordan.</b> It is not written, ‘have them cross’ but rather ‘have them come up.’ From this we learn that from the bank upon which they were standing did they come up. And it is impossible to claim that they were standing beside the western bank of the Jordan, for it is said previously, ‘that the feet of the <i>Kohanim</i> were immersed in the edge of the water.’<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 3:15.</i> And there it is said, ‘And the <i>Kohanim</i> remained standing— and all the Bnei Yisroel crossed over.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 16. Obviously since the Bnei Yisroel crossed the Jordan from East to West, and the <i>Kohanim</i> remained standing at the point of entrance, they were on the Eastern bank of the Jordan.</i>

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>The soles of the feet of the <i>Kohanim</i> were lifted.</b> [They were lifted] from the water to the dry land next to them, and the water returned to their place. The result of this was that the Ark was on this [eastern] side and the Bnei Yisroel were on this [the western] side. Thus the Ark lifted its carriers and crossed over. It was regarding this that Uzzah was punished ‘when he took hold of the Ark,’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel, VI: 6,7.</i> for if the Ark carried its carriers, it certainly was able to carry itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Thus by taking hold of the Ark, Uzzah manifested his fear that the Ark was going to fall off the wagon.</i>

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Yehoshua set up in Gilgal.</b> This was the lodging place where they spent that night.

Chapter 5



Verse 1

<b>Who were on the western side of the Jordan.</b> On the side to which Bnei Yisroel crossed, which is the western side, since they had been on the eastern side.

Verse 2

<b>Sharp knives.</b> As translated by Targum, sharp knives. Similarly, ‘You also turned back the sharp edge of his sword.’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 89:44.</i> When the sharp edge is turned sideways it does not cut well. ‘Similarly, ‘Every weapon that is sharpened against you?’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 54.</i>
<b>The second time.</b> For there had already been a circumcision— on the night of their departure from Egypt a large assembly were collectively circumcised, and this was the second time; because during the entire forty years that they were in the wilderness the north wind did not blow for them, and they did not have a suitable day to circumcise themselves, as we learned in <i>Maseches Yevamos.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yevomos 71b. Certain atmospheric conditions were beneficial for the healing of the wound caused by circumcision. The north wind created this condition. These winds were withheld during the forty years in the wilderners in order that the “Clouds of Glory” that led and protected the people would not disperse.</i> Our Sages said, “The second time refers to exposing the corona at circumcision. [This particular aspect of circumcision] was not commanded to our Patriarch, Avrohom.

Verse 3

<b>Gival Ha-orlos.</b> [Lit. Hill of the foreskins] It was so called, because of the event, [i.e., the mass of foreskins that were circumcised] which were made into a hill.

Verse 4

<b>And this is the reason.</b> [Lit. and this is the thing] After this speech he circumcised them. He said to them. “Do you think you will inherit this land while you are yet uncircumcised? Was it not said to Avrohom, ‘And you will preserve My covenant etc.’ ‘and I will give you and your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 17:8,9. Thus the inheritance of the land was dependent on their preserving the covenant, which was the rite of circumcision.</i>
<b>All the people that went out.</b> Not one of them was here for they had all died, and they had all been circumcised, as it is said, ‘for they were circumcised.’<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Next verse.</i>

Verse 5

<b>Were not circumcised.</b> As I have previously explained, the north wind had not blown.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to verse 2.</i> It was these who were now to be circumcised.

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>And their children whom He brought up in place of them.</b> And their children whom He brought up in place of them, they were born in the wilderness it was them whom Yehoshua circumcised.

Verse 8

<b>They remained in their places.</b> They remained in their places and they did not besiege the city.
<b>Until they were healed</b> from their wounds.

Verse 9

<b>I have removed.</b> (Lit. I have rolled) I have removed the ridicule of the Egyptians who had said [when they were leaving], “See that ‘<i>Raah</i>’ is before you.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos, 10:10.</i> There is a star named <i>Raah,</i> which is a symbol of blood. We see it overpowering you in the wilderness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Egyptians intimated that Bnei Yisroel would meet with disaster if they left Egypt because they would be under the power of the star of blood.</i> This is what Moshe referred to in the wilderness [when he said,] “Why should the Egptians speak, saying, ‘With <i>Raah,</i> He took them out.’” But they did not know that [the blood they saw] was the blood of circumcision. And now when they were circumcised in the days of Yehoshua, and the blood of circumcision appeared, that ridicule was removed; for the mixed multitude that went up with them [from Egypt] were still taunting them. This is the way R’ Moshe, Ha Darshan explained [this passage.]
<b>I have removed.</b> [Lit. I have rolled] This is similar to: ‘Remove from me humiliation and contempt;’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 119:22.</i> ‘and he rolled off the stone.’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 29:10.</i>

Verse 11

<b>From the day after the Pesach.</b> This was the day of waving the <i>Omer,</i> for they sacrificed the <i>Omer</i> first.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">They could not have eaten from the new grain of Eretz Yisroel until after they brought the Omer sacrifice. See Vayikroh 23:14.</i> From the seventh day of Adar, the day when Moshe died, when the <i>manna</i> stopped falling, they were sufficiently supplied with the <i>manna</i> which was in their vessels which they gathered on the seventh of Adar, as it is said, ‘They ate the <i>manna</i> for forty years.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 16:35.</i> But these forty years lacked thirty days— for the <i>manna</i> began to fall on the fifteenth day of Iyar.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 161, 13. See Rashi’s comments there.</i> We must say therefore that in the [matzo] cakes the Bnei Yisroel took with them from Egypt, they tasted the taste of <i>manna.</i>

Verse 12

<b>No longer did the Bnei Yisroel have <i>manna</i>.</b> Therefore they ate of the grain of the land. If they would have had <i>manna</i> they would not have eaten of the grain, for the <i>manna</i> was agreeable to them. There is a parable for this: One says to a child, “Why are you eating barley bread?” “Because I have no wheat bread.” That is why it is said, ‘no longer did etc.’

Verse 13

<b>When Yehoshua was in Yericho.</b> From here we can learn that the outskirts of a city are considered part of the city itself, for it impossible to say that Yoshua was actually inside Yericho.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Bnei Yisroel had not yet captured Yericho, he could not have been in the city itself.</i>
<b>Are you with us?</b> Have you come to support us?

Verse 14

<b>Households.</b> In one family grouping there can be many individual households. 
<b>Men</b> Individualy, man by man. Each man of the household was to come to the choosing of lots.

Verse 15

<b>Burned with fire.</b> His tent and movable property [shall be burned].
<b>He and all that he possesses.</b> [This should be understood] according to the law explained below— he and his livestock [are put to death] by stoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See below v. 25.</i> The <i>zakeif</i> accent, appearing over the word, בָּאֵשׁ indicates that the word בָּאֵשׁ (with fire) is separated from the word אוֹתוֹ, (he). We find other verses in which the accent divides the verse, such as, ‘אַחַרֵי דֶרֶך מְבוֹא הַשֶׁמֶשׁ’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 11:30. See Rashi and Sifsei Chachomim there.</i> (Far past the Jordan, the direction in which the sun sets). The word אַחַרֵי is separated from the word דֶרֶך by virtue of the [<i>pashta</i>] accent. Thus the interpretation of our verse is: He who is convicted [by the Ark] because of his taking of the condemned, shall be burned with fire, [which means] that which is fit to be burned [shall be burned], as is explained below.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">V. 25.</i>
<b>He and all that he possesses.</b> [This should be understood.] According to the law explained below.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> This is an abbreviated verse, and there is a similar verse to it: ‘Whoever strikes the Jebusites and reaches the tower.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 5:8.</i> The verse does not explain what will be done to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">We are not told what reward will be given to the one who reaches the tower.</i> but in Sefer Divrei Ha Yomim,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayumim 11:5.</i> it is explained ‘that he will become a leader.’ Here too, it is not explained what will be done to him ‘and to all that he possesses,’ but everything is explained below.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">V. 25.</i>

Verse 16

<b>And brought the Bnei Yisroel near.</b> He brought them in front of the <i>Choshen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Choshen</i> was one of the sacred garments worn by the <i>Kohein Gadol.</i> The Divine decisions were given through the letters inscribed on the <i>Choshen.</i></i> on which the names of the tribes were inscribed. The Holy One, blessed is He, gave him a sign— the stone of the sinning tribe will fade, and the stone inscribed with Yehudah’s name, faded.

Verse 17

<b>And when he brought near the family of Yehudah.</b> To the initial casting of lots he brought the heads of families near, one man from each family, and they cast lots [to see] on whom it would fall. Afterwards lots were cast on each household— one man from each household came to the casting of lots, and then came all the men of that particular household.

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>I beseech you, give honor.</b> Ochan began to defame the casting of lots.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As a means of establishing guilt.</i> He said to Yehoshua, “On the basis of casting lots, Are you accusing me? You and Elozer, the <i>Kohein,</i> are the greatest of the generation. If a lot was cast between you, it would certainly fall on one of you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore lots are not a definitive method of reaching a decision.</i> Yehoshua then said to him, ‘I beseech you, give honor, (etc).’ “I ask you, please do not defame the method of casting lots, for this is the way the land will ultimately be divided.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">You are therefore casting doubt on the division of the land.</i>

Verse 20

<b>And Ochan answered.</b> He saw the men of [the tribe of] Yehudah assembling for war,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">They were prepared to go to war to protect Ochan, who was one of their tribe.</i> and he said, “It is better that I alone should die rather than have many thousands of Bnei Yisroel killed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">There would have been a civil war between the tribe of Yehudah and the other tribes. This would have caused thousands of casualties.</i>
<b>And I have done the following.</b> (Lit. and this and this have I done)<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The implication was that this was not the only time he had sinned regarding sacred things.</i> I also sinned regarding other sacred things, during the days of Moshe, as it is said, ‘I will sanctify their cities.’<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 21:2. This occurred when the Bnei Yisroel took revenge against Midian and declared that some of the booty be considered sacred.</i>

Verse 21

<b>I saw amidst the spoils</b>—I gave thought to what is written in the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i> understands וָאֵרֶה as referring to intellectual comprehension.</i> ‘and you shall consume, [the booty] etc.’<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 20:14. Ochan took this verse as a command to consume the booty captured from the enemy.</i>
<b>A Babylonian garment.</b> This is translated according to the Targum. Any king who did not possess a palace in Eretz Yisroel, was not content with his kingship, as it is said, ‘And I will give you a desired land, and inheritance desired by many nations.’<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiahu 3:19. The verse obviously refers to Eretz Yisroel, which is the land desired many kings.</i> The king of Babylonia had a palace in Yericho, and when he visited here he would wear them.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This explains how a Babylonian garment was found in Yericho.</i>

Verse 22

<b>And they ran to [his] tent.</b> They wanted to get there before the tribe of Yehudah had a chance to remove the articles and deny the accuracy of the lots.

Verse 23

<b>And they spread them out.</b> The Targum renders וַיַצִקָם as וְאַתִּיכוּנוּן [which implies, and they melted them] Our Sages said, ‘He [Yehoshua] came and cast them before the Omnipresent. He said before him, “Master of the universe, for these, shall the bulk of Sanhedrin fall?’”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Because of these insignificant items, will You punish them.</i>

Verse 24

<b>His sons etc., and all of Yisroel.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Why was it necessary to bring all of Yisroel? Rashi therefore explains—to witness his downfall.</i> To witness his downfall, and to be forewarned against doing as he did.
<b>His ox(en) and his mule(s)</b> to destroy them, as it was said, ‘And he who is convicted by [his guilt in taking of] the sacred things, shall be burned with fire, he and all that he possesses.’<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Verse 15 above, and Rashi’s commentary there.</i>

Verse 12

<b>He took about five thousand men.</b> One ambush contingent following the other each approaching nearer to the city than its fellow.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The question is, what was the purpose of this second ambush party? Some suggest that these five thousand men were not to enter the city. Their task was to attack the army of Ai from behind, as they were pursuing the main army of Bnei Yisroel. When Yehoshua and his army would turn and attack, the army of Ai would be caught between them.</i>

Verse 13

<b>The people positioned.</b> This positioning expresses readiness to wage war near the [city] wall. This is similar to what is said regarding Ben-Hadad, in I Melachim 20:12, (who said to his servants:) “Position yourselves against the city and they positioned themselves.”
<b>And their ambush party</b> their ambushers this word עַקֵבוֹ is similar to וַיעֲקְבֵנִי.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 27:36. Eisov said regarding Yaakov, וַיַעְקְבֵנִי זֶה פַּעֲמַיִם “He has deceived me twice.” An ambush implies cunning and trickery.</i>
<b>That night, Yehoshua walked through the valley </b> Our Sages have said that he lodged in the depth of the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages interpreted the word עֵמֶק as an expression of depth, and they say he spent the night studying Torah. After all the preparations were made and orders given, Yehoshua had time to return to the study of Torah, which is the real protection in time of crisis. He remembered the rebuke of the angel on the night before the fall of Yericho.</i>

Verse 14

<b>At the appointed time.</b> At the time of day they had astrologically predicted previously, saying “at that time we will go out,” for they were sorcerers and diviners.

Verse 18

<b>Stretch out the spear.</b> This was the signal to the ambush party.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This signal was for the second, smaller ambush party of 5000 men.

<b>And there he wrote on the stones.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">There are different opinions as to what Yehoshua wrote on the stones.

Others say that he only wrote the Ten Commandments as they are recorded in Seifer Devorim (5:6-18).

According to Rabbi Yehudah it written directly on the stones, and later whitewashed as the verse states, “you are to write on them—and coat them with whitewash.” (Devorim 27:3,4.) Rabbi Shimon said that if they were whitewashed on top of the writing no one would be able to read it, which would defeat the purpose of the commandment. According to him the whitewash was put on first, to make the stones easier to write on and easier to read.

<b>They presented themselves as envoys.</b> They made themselves look like messengers.

Verse 3

<b>And it extended southward to Maalei-Akrabim.</b> The words: וְיָצָא, and it extended, וְנַסֵּב, and it encircled, and וְתָּאַר, and it encompassed, are used only in the place where the boundary line bulges outward, or is indented inward, and does not follow a straight line, and here it bulges outward and reaches to the south of Maalei-Akrabim, in the south of Maalei Akrabim. Thus Maalei-Akrabim is within the line, and [the line] passed it and continued westward,
<b>To Tzin.</b> (צִנָה) is the same as לְצִין , to Tzin. Every word that requires a <i>lamed</i> as, a prefix will have a <i>hei</i> as a suffix.
<b>And went up.</b> Whatever rises eastward towards <i>Yerushalayim</i> goes up higher; and from Yerushalayim and further it descends. From this we learn that Yerushalayim is higher than any place in Eretz Yisroel. Yerushalayim is actually not mentioned in the boundary since it was in the northern boundary of Yehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These verses discuss the southern boundary.</i> as is stated later in this chapter.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See below verse 8.</i>
<b>And went up from the south to Kodeish-barneia.</b> The line went from the south of Kodeish-barneiah; thus, Kodeish is within the [boundary] line.
<b>And it passed Chetzron.</b> He continues counting (the cities) westward until “and its boundary extended to the sea.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See next verse.</i>

Verse 4

<b>Extended.</b> The end of the border was at the Great Sea,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Mediterranean Sea.</i> which is the western border of all of Eretz Yisroel. Thus the boundary of Yehudah occupies the entire length of Eretz Yisroel from east to west and is located in the south of Eretz Yisroel.

Verse 5

<b>The eastern boundary.</b> Referring to the boundary line that stretches along the eastern border of Yehudah.
<b>The Salt (Dead) Sea.</b> It is located at the south eastern corner of the land, as stated in Parshas אֵלֶה מַסְעֵי<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 34:12.</i>
<b>To the end of the Jordan.</b> The width of the boundary of Yehudah is only that which is opposite the Dead Sea to the place where the Jordan empties into the Dead Sea, for the Jordan itself is also on the eastern border of the land of Canaan, as stated in Parshas אֵלֶה מַסְעֵי<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> regarding the eastern border. The boundary descended to the Jordan and it extended to the Dead Sea, which is at the corner.
<b>And the boundary of the north side.</b> The border line stretching along the northern border from east to west goes from the bay of the Dead Sea, from the place where the Jordan empties into it, as we have said that the width of the eastern boundary ends there; and it goes up westward to Beis Chogloh, and then the boundary line passes to the north of Beis HaArovoh which is the south of Eretz Yisroel. Beis HaArovo therefore is included in the boundary of Yehudah within the boundary line.

Verse 6

<b>The boundary went up to Even bohan.</b> As the border line goes toward Yerushalayim, it becomes elevated<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to Verse 3. There is a difference of opinion regarding the name of the the place.

According to <i>Metzudos Tzion,</i> the city itself was called <i>Even Bohan,</i> and its ruler was a man called ben Reuvein.</i>

Verse 7

<b>The boundary went up to Devir from the Valley of Ochor.</b> The Valley of Ochor was between Even Bohan and Devir.
<b>And it turned northward to Gilgol.</b> When it reached Gilgol, the boundary widens, and the borderline extends northward to Gilgol which is opposite Maalei-adumim, whose elevation [Maalei] is south of the Valley. The valley therefore is outside the borderline and is not within the boundary of Yehudah.
<b>South of the Valley.</b> It was a steep incline without water.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">נַחַל is usually translated as a river, but since as Rashi comments, there was no water, he translates it as a valley.</i>

Verse 8

<b>The boundary went up to the valley of Ben-hinom.</b> It continued going up somewhat until it reached Ein-itim and from there on it descends. This is what our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said in the chapter of שְׁחִיטַת קָדְשִׁים:<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Zevachem 54b.</i> They considered building [the Beis Ha Mikdosh] in Ein-itim which is a bit higher than Yerushalayim.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse states, “וּבֵין כְּתֵפָיו שָׁכֵן, and He resides between his shoulders,” (Devorim 33:12), they remarked, “Let us descend a little, because the shoulders are below the head.” The verse states that the Almighty will reside between the shoulders of the boundary of Binyomin, i.e., that the Beis Ha Mikdosh which is the resting place of the Shechina, will be built in the area of the Tribe of Binyomin. King David thought it should be built at Ein-itim which is twenty-three <i> amohs</i> higher than <i>Yerushalayim</i>, but they said, “There is nothing more pleasing about the ox than his shoulders.</i>
<b>To the southern side of the Yevusi.</b> Yerushalayim is outside the boundary line, and is not in the boundary of Yehudah, but within the boundary of Binyomin which is to the north of Yehudah.

Verse 9

<b>And it encompassed.</b> This is an expression of circling, similar to, “and with a compass, he circles it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 44:13.</i> Targum Yonasan translates them all, and he encircled.
<b>And extended to the cities of Mount Efron.</b> The boundary line extended northward, and the boundary widens to encompass the cities of Mount Efron.
<b>And the boundary circled to Baaloh.</b> This is not in a westerly direction, but its projection was to the north.

Verse 10

<b>The boundary turned from Baaloh westward.</b> Now he reverts to his previous description [of the cities] from the east to the west.
<b>To the side of Mount Yearim to the north.</b> The borderline was to the north of Mount Yearim. Thus Mount Yearim was within the boundary of Yehudah, within the borderline.

Verse 14

The Talmud, Maseches, Temurah 16A, relates the following: Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav, “When Moshe was about to leave this world, he said to Yehoshua, ‘Do you have any questions regarding the laws of the Torah? Ask me about them and I will teach them to you now.’ Yehoshua replied, ‘Rebbe! Did I leave your presence even for an hour? Did I ever travel to another place? Did you yourself not write about me in the Torah, “But his servant Yehoshua, son of Nun, a young man never departed from the Tabernacle.’” (Shemos 33:11) Thus Yehoshua implied that since he served Moshe faithfully for forty years and had studied Torah diligently, there was nothing that he did not know. This was considered a sin for Yehoshua and as a result, he immediately forgot three hundred laws, and seven hundred additional laws became unclear to him. During the month of mourning for Moshe, the Bnei Yisroel forgot many more laws. A total of three thousand laws were forgotten during this period. Rav Avahu said, “Nevertheless they were brought back by Osniel, son of Kenaz through his dialectic scholarship, as it is said, “And Osniel, son of Kenaz, conquered it (Kiryas Seifer).” After Caleiv conquered Chevron he approached the scholars in the Beis Midrash who were called יוֹשְׁבֵי דְבִיר, those who sit in Devir, because they sat all day studying דִבְרֵי תוֹרָה, the <i>words</i> of Torah, and challenged them to rediscover the forgotten laws. He announced that the one who would overcome, וּלְכָדָה (conquer) these problems would be worthy to become his son-in-law.</i>

<b>The lot for the descendants of Yoseif came out</b> at the northern border which marked the end of Yehoshua’s conquest.

This new Mishkan was built with walls of stone and was more permanent than the Mishkan that Moshe built with wooden walls. This Mishkan remained standing in Shiloh for 369 years. In many ways it was similar to the Beis HaMikdash that was built in Yerushalayim. Many of the <i>korbonas</i> were permitted to be sacrificed and eaten in Shiloh, such as: <i>Shelamin,</i> (peace-offerings) <i>Todah,</i> (thanksgiving-offerings) the <i>korban Pesach,</i> (the paschal lamb) and the first-born offerings. Various tithes (maasir) could also be brought to the Mishkan at Shiloh. After the Mishkan at Shiloh was destroyed, the people mourned as they would at the destruction of the Beis Hamikdosh in Yerushalayim. Whenever they passed by its ruins they wood weep and mourn. It was therefore known as Taanis-Shiloh, which implies the mourning of Shiloh.</i> and the boundary line passed east of Yonoach.

Verse 1

Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Ten portions of land fell to Menashe.</b> Six portions went to the family divisions mentioned above, and four went to the daughters of Tselophchod, not because each of them was considered an individual family division but rather because they took <i>these</i> four portions: the portion of their father who was one of those who went out of Egypt; since according to the number of those who went out of Egypt was the land divided; the portion their father shared with his brothers in the property of their father, Cheifer, since he too was one of those who went out of Egypt; and since their father, Tselophchod, was the firstborn, he received two portions [of Cheifer’s property]; and an additional portion from their father’s brother who died in the wilderness, without children and they received the inheritance of his share. This was stated by our Sages in <i>Bava Basra.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Bava Basra 119A.</i> It was unnecessary for Scripture to relate to us the number of the daughters’ share, except to teach us that they took the share of the firstborn, and to inform us that Eretz Yisroel was an actual inheritance to them [since it was considered] the actual possession of their fathers, for the firstborn does not receive an extra portion in potential property as he does in actual property.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A firstborn receives a double portion only of the property that actually belonged to his father, but not of the property that was only potentially his father’s. Regarding the inheritance of Eretz Yisroel, the portions that were destined for them were considered their actual possession and not just potential property. The daughters of Tzelophechod, therefore, were able to inherit that extra portion of their father.</i>

<b>The land of Tapuach.</b> The villages and the towns [belonged to Menashe], but the city of Tapuach itself belonged to the descendants of Ephraim.

Verse 9

<b>These cities—</b> from Tapuach to the stream of Kanoh belonged to Ephraim, but were located among the cities of Menashe.

Verse 10

<b>The southern side belonged to Ephraim:</b> Ephraim took his share from the south, facing the land between the descendants of Yehudah and the rest of the tribes.
<b>The northern side belonged to Menashe.</b> Menashe took the land to the north.

Verse 11

<b>These were three regions.</b> [as the Targum], Three provinces. The three regions mentioned here consisted of Dor and Ein dor, as stated above in this Seifer:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Above 12:23.</i> “The king of Dor of the Dor region,” and in another verse it states:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Above 11:2.</i> “In the region of Dor on the west,” and here it is stated: “The inhabitants of Dor and its towns.” These are three regions that belonged to her.

Verse 12

<b>Resolved</b>—were willing.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The tribe of Menashe set a bad precedent by taxing the Canaanites instead of destroying them as the Torah commanded. This evil practice was soon adopted by the other tribes. Even though the tribe of Ephraim also did not drive out the Canaanites (see above 16:10), they at least forced them into slave labor, whereas the tribe of Menashe demanded only a money tax. This was considered a graver sin as it allowed these Canaanites the ability to influence the Jews much more than those who were actually enslaved.</i>

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>And the descendants of Yoseif spoke.</b> Referring specifically to the descendants of Menashe.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi even though the tribe of Ephraim was part of the “descendants of Yoseif”, they did not join the tribe of Menashe in their complaint. The reason being, as Rashi later explains, was that while the tribe of Menashe had experienced a sharp increase of their population, the tribe of Ephraim experienced a decrease in its population, and were therefore quite satisfied with their portion of inheritance. This is based on the opinion that the size of the individual tribe’s inheritance was determined by their number at the time they left Egypt. During the years in the desert Menashe grew faster than any other tribe. When they left Egypt their number was 32,200 and when they entered Eretz Yisroel it was 52,700, an increase of 20,500. They were given land for 32,200 portions but they had to divide it among all 52,700 members of their tribe, and this was the basis of their complaint.</i>
<b>For until now so much has Adonoy blessed me.</b> For you have seen that my population has increased from the first counting to the second counting by twenty thousand, five hundred, which is the numerical equivilent of כּה (25). In the first counting you found the number of Menashe, stated in Seifer Bamidbar,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Parshas Bamidbar 1:35.</i> to be thirty two thousand, two hundred, and in Parshes Pinchos<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"> Bamidbar 26:34.</i> their number was fifty two thousand, seven hundred. Another explanation is: until now, until כּה referring to the blessing that was said to Avrohom, “So (כּה) shall be your seed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 15:5.</i> This blessing has been fulfilled in my tribe. And according to its plain meaning, until now-as I am now— until I am the multitude you see now.

Verse 15

<b>If you are indeed such a multitude of people—</b> then you have the strength to cut down forests and to clear them, as expressed in old French, essarter, and there you will be able to build cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua obviously could not change the portion that had been alloted to them in accordance with the method with which the Ribono Shel Olam had commanded him to distribute the land. He therefore suggested that they clear the forest in the mountains, which would give them sufficient land to settle their families and to build cities for them. This land was unclaimed and could be theirs after clearing it and settling there.</i>
<b>And cut out—</b> This is an expression of cutting, as stated, “And they will cut them down with their swords,”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 23:47.</i> essarteras-in Old French,
<b>Crowded</b>—dense [or stress].

Verse 16

<b>The mountain will not be sufficient for us.</b> For it is too crowded for us as you [just] said.
<b>It will not be sufficient.</b> It will not be enough.
<b>Iron chariots.</b> ‘And that what you say, go up to the forest and conquer the land of the Perezzites and the Rephaim [is not so simple] because the Canaanites are a mighty people, and they possess iron chariots.’ Do not wonder if Scripture refers to the Perezzites and Rephaim as Canaanites for they were all descendants of the original Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The original Canaan was the grandson of Noach, who was cursed by Noach.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>For the mountain will be yours.</b> The mountain of which I said to you “Go up to the forest.”
<b>For it is a forest and you will cut it down.</b> For it is a forest and it is only fitting for a multitude of people, that will cut it down and clear it.
<b>And you will cut it down.</b> You who are a multitude of people.
<b>And as far as it extends will be yours.</b> For you will drive out the Canaanites. Because you are a multitude of people.
<b>Even though they possess iron chariots.</b> None of the other tribes have sufficient man power to fight them.
<b>Even though they are stong.</b> You have the ability and will drive them out. Our Rabbis explained [the meaning of] ‘Go up to the forest— Hide yourselves in the forest and the “evil eye” will have no power over you.’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> Yehoshua implied that the forest would protect them against the “evil eye.” Because they were so numerous and multiplied so rapidly, they would invoke jealousy from their neighbors. It was therefore to their advantage to live in a forest area where they would not be so visible. If they would live in the cities of the plains, everyone would see how numerous they were, but in the forest they would not be as visible.</i>

Verse 1

<b>And there they made a dwelling place for the Tent of Meeting.</b> [This refers to the Tent of Meeting] that they had constructed in the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Since Scripture does not identify the Tent of Meeting, Rashi explains that it is the same one they had constructed in the wilderness.</i> It did not have a roof, but it was a stone structure on the bottom and was covered with curtains above.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Zevachim 24b. During the fourteen years since they entered Eretz Yisroel, the <i>Mishkan</i> remained at Gilgal. They had been too occupied with conquering and dividing the land to establish a permanent dwelling place for the Tent of Meeting. Once they began settling in the land, they established a House of God. The walls of the House were made of stone, and instead of a roof it was covered with curtains of cloth and skins, as it had been when it was constructed in the wilderness.</i> This we learned in Maseches Zevachim.
<b>And the land had been conquered before them.</b> Once the <i>Mishkon</i> was established, it became easier for them to conquer the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The land had actually not been conquered at that point in time, but even though the conquest had not been completed, they had faith that in the merit of the <i>Mishkan,</i> they would be blessed with continued victory in the remaining battles of conquest.</i>

Verse 2

<b>Seven tribes.</b> [For the following tribes] had already received their portions: Reuvein, Gad, and the half tribe of Menashe had received their inheritance in the days of Moshe on the other side of the Jordan. In the land of Canaan itself, the lot had already fallen for Yehudah, Ephraim and the half tribe of Menashe. These five tribes were provided for.

Verse 5

<b>And they will divide it into seven parts.</b> Including that which was already conquered and that which was destined to be conquered.
<b>Yehudah will remain at his boundary in the south</b>— of Eretz Yisroel, for there fell to his lot the entire southern boundary.
<b>And the house of Yoseif—in the north.</b> The north of the land already conquered. There is however much more to be conquered: the side of the boundary from Baal-gad to Levo-chamos which is near Hor hoHor in the northern boundary.

Verse 12

<b>Their northern boundary.</b> Their northern boundary was the Jordan, since the border started from the east and went up alongside Yericho from the north. It went from there westward alongside Yericho and the border line is drawn on the northside of Yericho. Thus Yericho is within the border line in the portion of Binyomin.
<b>To the wilderness of Beis-Oven.</b> To the wilderness of Beis-Oven.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"> Rashi explains that the text מִדְבְּרָה בֵּית אָוֶן is the same as לַמִדְבַּר שֶׁל בֵּית אָוֶן.</i>

Verse 13

<b>From there the boundary passed</b>—westward.
<b>To Luz, the southside of Luz which is Beis El.</b> [This is the city] that Yaakov called [Beis-el.] It is not the Beis-el which is near Ai, for it is said about the boundary of Yoseif: ‘And it extended from Beis-el to Luz.’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 16:2.</i> Thus we learn that there were two [Beis-els]. Luz was not in the portion of Binyomin; for the boundary line was from Luz and within; as it is said: ‘To the southside of Luz.’ the boundary line goes south of Luz, thus Luz is outside the boundary line, and is within the inheritance of the Bnei Yoseif. Beis-el is in the portion of Binyomin; as it said later in this section.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Verse 22.</i>

Verse 14

<b>And the boundary circled and went around the western side southward.</b> At Atros-ador, the length of the northern boundary ended; it went from east to west. From there the boundary line encircled the western boundary of Binyomin to go southward from north to south. The western boundary line, extended from the mountain which was opposite Beis-choron— south of the mountain— which was south of Beis-choron; that was the beginning of the northwest corner of Binyomen’s [portion,] and the boundary line went from north to south.
<b>It extended—</b> From its south-western corner to Kiryas-yearim which belonged to Yehudah. Thus the width of Binyomin’s boundary occupies the entire width of the land between Yehudah and Ephraim. His [Binyomin’s] southern boundary meets with the northern boundary of Yehudah, which was the location of <i>Yerushalayim</i>, as is said later in this chapter.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">V. 28.</i> Thus both tribes had a share in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The major portion of Yehudah’s territory was to the south, but there was one strip of land that extended north and bordered the portion of Binyomin. It extended to the city of the Yevusim which later became <i>Yerushalayim</i>. (See v. 28) The city and the <i>Beis ha Mikdosh</i> were situated right on the border of the two tribes. There are various opinions regarding the exact location of the Altar itself. Some say that it was in Binyomin’s portion, while others maintain that it was in the portion of Yehudah.</i> The Northern boundary of Binyomin and the sourthern boundary of Ephraim meet, and Shiloh was located there in the portion of Ephraim, as it is said, ‘And He abandoned the Mishkan of Shiloh, etc., and He abhorred the tent of Yoseif, and the tribe of Ephraim He did not choose.’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 78:60,67.</i> Binyomin too had a share in it [Shiloh], and so we learned in Maseches Zevachim, ‘In three places the Divine Presence rested in Eretz Yisroel: in Shiloh, in Nov and in the Beis ha Mikdosh; and of all of them, it rested only in the portion of Binyomin:<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">From the time the land was divided, the Divine Presence (שְׁכִינָה) rested within the portion of Binyomin. Initially the Divine Presence rested in the Mishkon at Shiloh. After its destruction, the Mishkon was established at Nov, which was also within Binyomin’s portion. It was moved from there to Givon and afterwards to <i>Yerushalayim</i> where the Beis ha Mikdosh was built. The reason for the pre-eminence of Binyomin in this respect, was the blessing Moshe gave to him, as it is said: “Adonoy’s friend, let him live secure with Him. He hovers protectively over him throughout the day, and He resides between his shoulders.” (Devorim 33:12) The <i> Shechina,</i> Divine Presence, resided in Shiloh for many years, and for a short time it <i>hovered</i> over Nov and Givon, and finally a permanent, eternal dwelling place for the <i>Shechina</i> was established in <i>Yerushalayim</i>. Thus in his blessing, Moshe alluded to the places within the territory of Binyomin in which the Divine Presence would reside. (See Rashi there).</i>
<b>This was the western side—</b> the west side extending from Atros-ador to Kiryas-yearim.

Verse 15

<b>And the southern side—</b> Referring to the southern border of Binyomin which is identical with the northern border of Yehudah. All the borders that are listed here are listed relative to the north of Yehudah, and every place described here as descending, is described in reference to Yehudah as going up because here he is listing [boundaries] from west to east and there he lists them from east to west.

<b>[Divide the spoils] with your brothers—</b> Referring to Bnei Gad and Bnei Reuvein. There are some who interpret “brothers” in referrence to those who remained behind to guard the cities and the women and children.

Verse 22

<b>Almighty God is Adonoy.</b> He is God over all divine beings. He is Adonoy, Who knows that our intent was not rebellion etc. By repeating this declaration twice, [they declared] that He is God in this world and in the World to Come.

Verse 23

Verse 24

<b>Our anxiety of this.</b> Because of anxiety, and the fear of insulting words, have we done this, as is further explained in the Scripture: ‘Lest tomorrow your children will say,’ Lest they insult our children— when they go to bring sacrifices in the <i>Mishkan</i> at Shiloh— lest they say to them, ‘What have you to do with Adonoy?’ Did he not set a boundary between us and you, namely, the Jordan. This was our fear and thus we made it. Every word, דְּאָגָה, found in Scripture expresses fear, similar to, “I am concerned [fear] that the Jews etc.” [These were the words] of Tzidkiahu.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Yirmiahu 38:19.

Verse 34

Verse 22

<b>You are witnesses against yourselves.</b> Yehoshua foresaw that in the future, they would undermine [the covenant] in the days of Yechezkeil and say, “We want to be like the [other] nations,” and therefore he was so hard on them now. Therefore it was said to them in the days of Yechezkeil, “The thought you entertain will never come to pass etc., As I live says Adonoy, God, I will rule over you with a strong hand etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> See Yechezkeil 20:32,33.</i> You have already accepted upon yourselves [the covenant] in the days of Yehoshua. And you can not say “We only accepted it upon ourselves in the days of Moshe because we wanted [God’s help] to enter the land,” since in the days of Yehoshua you had already entered the land, and [yet] you accepted the covenant.

Verse 25

<b>And he established it as a statute and an ordinance at Shechem.</b> He set in order for them there the statutes of the Torah and they accepted them upon themselves.

Verse 26

<b>And Yehoshua wrote, etc.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">What were the words that Yehoshua wrote and where did he write them? It might be inferred that he wrote the words of his admonishment to the people and inserted them in the Sefer Torah of Moshe, but we know this is not true.</i> According to Targum Yonasan— And Yehoshua wrote these words, and concealed them in the Sefer Torah of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to Targum Yonasan, He merely placed them where the Sefer Torah was kept, which was in the Ark.</i> In Maseches Makos,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"> 11a.</i> two <i>Amoraim</i> argue [about what Yehoshua wrote]. One says that it refers to the eight verses from ‘And Moshe died’ until ‘in view of all of Yisroel,’ for the Sefer Torah was incomplete and he [Yehoshua] completed it.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Devorim 34:5-12. These verses describe the passing of Moshe. Could Moshe have written them himself? How could he have written them while he was alive when they were not yet true? Moshe could not have written that he had died when it had not yet happened. This <i>Amora</i> says therefore that the final eight verses were written by Yehoshua.</i> The other one says that this refers to the chapter of the cities of refuge<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Chapter 20.</i> which he wrote in his book [Sefer Yehoshua] as they were written in the Sefer Torah.
<b>Under the doorpost.</b> This is translated according to Targum Yonasan, תְּחוֹת אַלְתָא. הָאַלָה refers to the door post of the entrance, as it is said,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I. Melachim 6:31.</i> “the doorposts were a fifth, and<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 40:10.</i> the doorposts had one measure.” Other say that [הָאַלָה means ‘the oak tree’] and it refers to the oak near Shechem which is written regarding Yaakov,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereishis 35:4. As Yaakov was preparing to return to his father, Yitzchok, in the Holy Land, he instructed that all idols and earrings were to be given to him and he buried them under the oak tree near Shechem.</i> “And Yaakov hid them beneath the oak.”
<b>Which is in the Sanctuary of Adonoy.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">But the Sanctuary had not yet been built.</i> Since the Ark was brought there [it is referred to as the Sanctuary] as it stated above,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1.</i> ‘And they stood before God.

Verse 27

<b>Behold this stone will be witness against us, etc.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The question is, how could the stone hear? Another problem: the verse states that it heard “all the words of Adonoy that He spoke to us,” and yet there is no mention of Adonoy having spoken to them.</i> [Here Rashi quotes from Targum Yonasan]: This stone will be for us as the two stone tablets of the covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua compared it to the two tablets of the Ten Commandments which were witness to the covenant at Mount Sinai, and are therefore always referred to as the לוּחוֹת הָעֵדוּת, the Tablets of Testimony.</i> for we have made it for a witness,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">It would stand as a silent witness to the covenant they had made on that day.</i> since the words written on it [the stone] are almost similar to all the words of God that He spoke to us. This verse can also be explained according to its plain meaning: for it [the stone] has heard the words that I have spoken to you, on behalf of the Omnipresent.

<b>In Simnas-serach.</b> This was its actual name. Elsewhere it is called Simnas-cheres<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Shoftim 2:9.</i> because they erected a figure of the sun upon his grave,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Shoftim 8:13 where חָרֶס refers to the sun. Also See Shoftim 14:18.</i> to indicate that he is the one that caused the sun to stand still, and all who pass by it say, “Woe for the loss of this one, who did such a great thing and died.” Others say its <i>actual</i> name was Simnas-cheres, and why was it called Simnas- serach? because its fruit would rot because of their abundant richness.
<b>The Storming Mountain</b> It was so named to teach us that the hill stormed [shook] and threatened to kill them, because the people did not eulogize him properly.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The verse merely states that “they buried him” and no mention is made of them having eulogized him, or mourned for him.</i>

<b>In the hill of his son, Pinchos.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">These words seem to imply that the hill belonged to Pinchos even during his father’s lifetime. But if he did not inherit it from Elozor, from where could he have gotten it? There are others who say that Pinchos did inherit the land from Elozor, and since inheritance takes effect immediately, it already belonged to Pinchos before Elozor was buried.</i> From where did Pinchos have a portion in the land? He inherited it from his wife.
