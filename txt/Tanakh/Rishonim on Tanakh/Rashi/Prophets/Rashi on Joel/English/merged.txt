Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>Sound a shophar</b>—to announce to them that they should repent before the evil befalls them.
<b>the day of the Lord</b>—which we mentioned above.

Verse 2

<b>like the dawn, spread over the mountains</b>—The increasing locusts and the shearing locusts are spread over the mountains as the dawn is spread over the entire world.
<b>the like of which has never been</b>—that all these species should come one after the other, but the species of arbeh alone did not equal that of Egypt, concerning which it is stated: (Exodus 10:14) “And after it there shall not be so.”

Verse 3

<b>Fire consumes before it</b>—They destroy everything as though a fire consumes before them and a flame blazes after them.
<b>like the Garden of Eden</b>—was the land before it came, and, after it goes, it leaves the land like a desert wasteland.

Verse 4

Verse 5

<b>like the sound of a flame</b>—A flame, consuming stubble, makes noise.
<b>arrayed for battle</b> Heb. עֱרוּךְ. Since it is in the construct state, it is vowelized with a “hataf segol.”

Verse 6

<b>gather blackness</b> Heb. קִבְּצוּ פָּארוּר. Blackness like a pot, Cf. (Num. 11:8) “And they cooked in a pot (בַּפָּרוּר).” The “aleph” is superfluous, and it is not read.

Verse 7

<b>and they do not make... crooked</b> Heb. וְעַבְּטוּן. This has no comparison, but its interpretation according to its context is: they do not make crooked.

Verse 8

<b>and upon the swords</b> Heb. וּבְעַד הַשֶּׁלַח, (verse 9) “through the windows (בְּעַד הַחַלוֹנִים).” Upon the weapons they fall and camp.
<b>they do not receive monetary gain</b> Heb. לֹא יִבְצָעוּ. They do not receive monetary gain. And <i>Jonathan</i> interpreted it (הַשֶּׁלַח) as an expression of an errand. Because of the errand of the Holy One, blessed be He, they cast themselves down, and they do not receive monetary gain.

Verse 9

<b>In the city they clatter</b> Heb. יָשֹׁקּוּ. This is an expression of making a din. Cf. (Isa. 33:4) “like the roaring (כְּמַשַּׁק) of the cisterns”; (Prov. 28: 15) “A growling (שּׁוֹקֵק) bear”; (Zeph. 2:9) “the clattering of (מִמְשַׁק) the thorns.” <i>Jonathan</i>, however, renders it as an expression of arms (נֶשֶק). They are armed.

Verse 10

Verse 11

<b>And the Lord gave forth (upon them) His voice</b>—by the statement of His prophets prior to His sending this host of His.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>assemble the elders</b> Heb. קִבְצוּ. This is of the form of (I Kings 18:19) “Send and gather (קְבֹץ) for me,” an expression which is weak and light.

Verse 17

<b>a derision</b> Heb. לְחֶרְפָּה
<b>for nations to make them an example</b> Heb. לְמְשָׁל, an expression of, (Deut. 28:37) “for an example (מָשָל) and for a conversation piece.”

Verse 18

<b>And the Lord was zealous for His land</b> Heb. וַיְקַנֵּא, an expression similar to (Num. 11:29) “Are you zealous (הַמְקַנֵּא) for me?” Their distress entered His heart, and He fought their battle and engaged in their necessities. Our Sages explain it as an expression of warning. He warned the locusts concerning His land. [from <i>Sotah</i> 3a]

Verse 19

<b>derision</b> Heb. חֶרְפָּה, a derision, that they will call you ill-provided.

Verse 20

<b>And the northerner</b> Heb. הַצְּפוֹנִי. This can be interpreted as referring to the host of locusts, upon which the expression, “and I will drive him to a land barren and desolate,” fits aptly. Another explanation: The people that come from the north, viz., the kings of Assyria. And our Sages (<i>Sukkah </i>52a) state: This is the temptation, which is hidden (צָפוּן) in a person’s heart.
<b>the western sea</b> the eastern sea. And our Sages, who interpreted it [i.e., הַצְּפוֹנִי] as a reference to temptation, interpreted these two seas as the First Temple and the Second Temple. I.e, they explain הַקַּדְמוֹנִי as first and הָאַחֲרוֹן as last. And so they explained it: Because he directed his face toward the First Temple and the Second Temple and destroyed them. [God says: I will drive him out to a land barren and desolate, where he will find no one to incite. That will be because he set his sights for the First Temple and for the Second Temple and, because he incited the people to sin, they were destroyed. The two Temples, where everyone would gather during the three Pilgrimage Festivals, are symbolized by the sea, where water of the streams gather.] And, according to the <i>Targum</i>, who explains it as a reference to the king of Assyria, we must explain “his face to the eastern sea, and his end to the western sea” to mean that part of his army I will send to the east and part of it to the west.
<b>its ill savor</b> Heb. צַחֲנָתוֹ. The word בָאְשוֹ, its stench, indicates concerning that it is an expression of filth.
<b>for it did great things</b>—I.e, it did a great evil, for it stretched forth its hands upon the great.

Verse 21

<b>Have no fear, O land</b>—I.e, the land of Israel, when you repent.

Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>the teacher for justification</b> Heb. מוֹרֶה. Your prophets who teach you to return to Me, in order to justify you.
<b>the early rain and the late rain.</b> Heb. מוֹרֶה, like (Deut. 11:14) “the early rain (יוֹרֶה) and the late rain (וּמַלְקוֹֹש).”
<b>in the first month</b>—In Nissan. Although the early rain is the first rain, which falls on the seeds, and that is in Marcheshvan, that year they sowed in Nissan, as is explained in Tractate <i>Taanith</i> (5a) that the grain grew in eleven days.

Verse 24

<b>shall roar</b> Heb. וְהֵשִׁיקוּ, an expression of making noise when the stream runs down from the winepress into the vat (הַיֶקֶב), which is the pit before the winepress

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>And it shall come to pass afterwards</b>—in the future.
<b>upon all flesh</b>—I.e, upon anyone whose heart becomes soft as flesh. Comp. (Ezekiel 36:26) “And I will give you a heart of flesh.”

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>and pillars of smoke</b> Heb. וְתִימְרוֹת. Perpendicular pillars of smoke, as tall as a palm tree.

Verse 4

<b>shall turn to darkness</b>—to embarrass those who prostrate themselves to the sun.

Verse 5

<b>And it shall come to pass that whoever shall call etc. as... said</b>—And where did He say it? (Deut. 28:10), “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the Name of the Lord is called on you.” [from <i>Mechilta</i>, Ex. 12:25]
<b>and among the survivors</b>—And in the remnant that will remain.
<b>whom the Lord invites</b> Heb. קֹרֵא, an expression of those invited to a banquet or to the service of the king, an expression of invitation.

Chapter 4



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>to the Valley of Jehoshaphat</b>—I will descend with them to the depth of justice. <b>Jehoshaphat</b>—The judgments of the Lord.

Verse 3

<b>they cast lots</b> Heb. יִדּוּ. Like (Lam. 3:53) “And they cast (וַיַּדּוּ) a stone upon me.”

Verse 4

<b>Are you paying Me recompense</b>—Is this the recompense for what Solomon gave Hiram, the king of Tyre, twenty cities (I Kings 9:11)?
<b>swiftly</b> Heb. קַל מְהֵרָה, an expression of eagerness.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>to the Shebaites</b>—To the children of Sheba.
<b>for the Lord has spoken</b>—Now where did He speak? (Gen. 9:25) “A slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers.” So it is explained in <i>Mechilta</i> (Ex. 12:25).

Verse 9

<b>prepare war</b>—if you can wage war against Me.

Verse 10

<b>your plowshares</b> Heb. אִתֵּיכֶם, <i>koltres</i> in O.F:, colters.
<b>and your pruning hooks</b> Heb. וּמַזְמְרוֹתֵיכֶם, serpes in French.

Verse 11

<b>Gather</b> Heb. עוּשׁוּ. Like חוּשוּ, hasten, so did Menahem associate it. <i>Jonathan</i>, however, renders: they shall gather, and I say that it is an expression of a block of iron (עֶשֶת), which is gathered together, masse in French, and the “tav” is not a radical.
<b>there the Lord shall break your mighty men</b> Heb. הַנְחַת. There in the gathering of the Valley of Jehoshaphat, He will break your might. So did <i>Jonathan </i>render it, but I do not know whether it is an Aramaic expression of lowering (נחת) or an expression of breaking (חתת), and the “nun” is defective. Cf. (Dan. 2:25) “brought Daniel in (הנְעַל) before the king,” which has no radical but על.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Stretch out a sickle etc.</b>—Draw the swords, you who go on My mission to destroy the nations.
<b>for the harvest is ripe</b>—I.e, for their time has arrived, and he compared the matter to harvest, which is harvested with sickles when it becomes completely ripe.
<b>come press for the winepress is full</b>—of grapes. Come and tread them; i.e., the measure of their iniquity is full. <b>press</b> Heb. רְדוּ, an expression of pressing [or ruling]. Cf. (Gen. 1:28) “And rule (וּרְדוּ) over the fish of the sea.”
<b>and the vats shall roar</b>—The sound of the stream of the wine going down in the vats before the winepresses is heard.

Verse 14

<b>in the valley of decision</b>—For there it is decided that the judgment is true. And so did <i>Jonathan </i>render: the valley of judgment.

Verse 15

<b>have withdrawn their shining</b>—Have taken in their shining.

Verse 16

<b>shall roar from Zion</b>—Because of what they did to Zion.
<b>and the heavens and earth shall quake</b>—He will deal retribution upon the heavenly princes and then upon the nations.
<b>a shelter</b> Heb. מַחֲסֶה, an expression of a cover, <i>abrier</i> in O.F., abri in modern French, a shelter.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>springs</b> Heb. אֲפִיקֵי, a place of the source of water.
<b>and water the valley of Shittim</b>—According to its apparent meaning, and it will water the valley of Shittim (<i>Targum</i>), and, according to its Midrashic meaning, He will atone for the iniquity of Peor.

Verse 19

<b>Egypt etc. and Edom</b>—He juxtaposed them as regards their retribution. You find that, were it not for Egypt, Edom would not exist, as it is stated: (I Kings 11:16 21) “For Joab and all Israel remained [stationed] there for six months etc. every male in Edom.” And it is stated there: (verse 17) “Adad fled, he and some Edomite men etc. And Hadad pleased Pharaoh very much etc. And Hadad etc. that David slept with his fathers etc.” And, at the end, (verse 25) “And he was an adversary to Solomon (sic).” Said the Holy One, blessed be He: I will destroy both of them.
<b>because of the violence done to the children of Judah</b>—Because of the violence they did to the children of Judah, viz., that they shed their blood.

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>Now should I cleanse, their blood I will not cleanse</b>—Even if I cleanse them of other sins in their hands, and of the evils they have done to Me, I will not cleanse them of the blood of the children of Judah. When will this come to pass? At the time the Holy One, blessed be He, dwells in Zion.
