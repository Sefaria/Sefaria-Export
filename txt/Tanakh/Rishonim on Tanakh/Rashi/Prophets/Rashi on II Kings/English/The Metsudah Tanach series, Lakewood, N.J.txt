Rashi on II Kings



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Through the lattice.</b> <i>Gradil</i>, in Latin. I say that they were accustomed to weave it as a warp and a woof with long and short boards, which is called (<i>lates</i>) <i>cantineli</i>, in Latin, and it was made full of holes like sort of a net, and it is called <i>prodne</i>, in O.F. But I heard that שְׂבָכָה is <i>wiz</i>, in O.F., and in German, <i>schwindel</i> <i>steg</i>, as I explained [in], “and by a winding stairway they went up.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Melochim 2:1</i>
<b>And he became ill.</b> An expression of sickness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">IMelochim 6:8.</i>

Verse 17

<b>And Yehorom reigned in his place.</b> He was his brother.
<b>In the second year of Yehorom, son of Yehoshophot.</b> Is it possible to say this? Did he not reign in the nineteenth year of Yehoshophot? For Achazyah reigned in the seventeenth year [of Yehoshophot] and he reigned for two years,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The root of the word is חלה (=to become ill).</i> and also, below it is written, “In the eighteenth year of Yehoshophot,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He did not reign for a full two years. He reigned during two different years, and his total reign might have been less than one year, covering only the last few months of one year and the first few months of the following year.—Ralbag</i> that Yehorom reigned, and Yehoshophot reigned twenty-five years before Yehorom, his son, reigned.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Below 3:1.</i> But, Yehoshophot deserved to be killed in Ramos Gilad, but as a reward for [his] crying out, his [death] was suspended for seven years,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to Radak, the seven years discrepancy is resolved as follows. Yehoshophot gave over the throne to Yehorom during his lifetime because he wanted to establish Yehorom as his successor and to prevent conflict among the brothers. This occurred at the end of Yehoshophot’s reign. The first seven years of Yehorom’s reign were while his father was alive. The second year of Yehorom’s reign corresponds with the year that Yehorom son of Achov became king over Yisroel, as stated below in 3:1.</i> and from that time [Scripture] counts [the years] to his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Tosefta Maseches Sotah 12:2. </i>

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>In a mighty wind.</b> In a stormy wind.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Yechezkeil 1:4, where a “רוּחַ סְעָרָה” is part of the vision of the מַעֲשֶׂה מֶרְכָּבָה that is described by Yechezkeil.</i>

Verse 2

<b>Please remain here.</b> He [Eliyahu] wished to drive him away because of his humility, so that he [Elisha] would not see him being taken away.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, he did not want Elisha to be frightened by seeing the manner by which he was being taken away.—Ralbag</i>

Verse 3

<b>Your master.</b> But [Scripture does] not [state,] “our master.” This teaches [us] that they were equal to Eliyahu.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., their level of prophecy was equal to Eliyahu’s. Tosefta Maseches Sotah 12:5.</i>

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>And [he] rolled it up.</b> He rolled it up in order that it would be easy to strike with it.
<b>And [he] rolled it up.</b> Not exactly rolling, but gathering together,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he did not fold it neatly on its creases, but he bunched it up together.</i> which is called <i>cueilir</i>, in O.F.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>You have made a difficult request.</b> It is impossible [for me] to give you more than I possess.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi, Elisha apparently asked for a double portion of Eliyahu’s spirit. Alternatively, Elisha requested to attain two thirds of Eliyahu’s spirit and for all other prophets together to attain one third. -Radak Or, Elisha requested double the spirit of any other prophet.—Ralbag</i>
<b>If you will witness my departure from you.</b> Then I will be able to do more and more.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if you are spiritually elevated enough to observe my ascent, it would be an indication that your request would be granted.</i>
<b>It will be so for you, and if not, it will not be.</b> That I am unable [to do so].

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>My father, my father! Chariot of Yisroel.</b> My endeared teacher<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He referred to Eliyahu as “father,” because one’s disciples are considered like one’s own children, and conversely, the teacher is considered a father.—Ralbag See Rashi in Devarim 6:7.</i> who is better for Yisroel with his prayers than chariots and horsemen.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his prayers are more effective for Yisroel than chariots and horsemen.—Targum</i>

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>Where is Adonoy, the God of Eliyahu?</b> That I was promised that a double portion of his spirit would rest upon me.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, where is God who does not show me His sign as He showed Eliyahu is the splitting of the water?”—Ralbag</i>
<b>Then he also struck the water.</b> He too. In the Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yose Haglili, [it states that] Elisha’s splitting [the Yardein] was twice as great as Eliyahu’s, for in the beginning there was the merit of them both, and now there was his merit alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi 3:1 below. Thus, Elisha’s request for twice Eliyahu’s spirit had been fulfilled.</i>

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>Perhaps the wind of Adonoy carried him up.</b> Is it possible that yesterday they said to him, “Do you know that today Adonoy is taking your master?”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Above, v. 5.</i> and now they did not know where he was?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">They thought Eliyahu’s spirit returned to God, but his body was cast to the ground, and they sought to find it and bury it.—Metzudas Dovid</i> This teaches [us] that since the day when Eliyahu was hidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Some say that Eliyahu’s body remained whole and unharmed. He was carried to גַּן עֵדֶן where he remains hidden from mankind except when he is sent on special missions or to appear to the righteous. Radak Alternatively, they did not know that he would be removed from the world. Rather, they thought that God would take Eliyahu away to some remote location for a period of time. This was not an unusual occurrence. See I Melochim 18:12.</i> the Holy Spirit departed from the prophets, and the Holy Spirit was no longer widespread throughout Yisroel.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Tosefta Maseches Sotah 12:5.</i>

Verse 17

<b>Until he was ashamed.</b> He was ashamed<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “to the point of embarrassment.” The root of בש is בוש [=shame].</i> [on account] of them, lest they say that he does not want to go to meet his teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he was afraid that they would think that he wanted Eliyahu to stay away so that he could keep his newly acquired position of leadership. Alternatively, the root of בש is בשש [=delay], i.e., “he delayed them considerably” from sending out people to search for Eliyahu. -Metzudas Dovid Also, see below 8:11 and Shemos 32:1.</i> Because he took over his high position, he does not want him to return. All this I saw in Tosefta of [Maseches] Sotah.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">12:5.</i>

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>But the water is bad.</b> And because of the water, the land causes people to die, and send them to their graves. If so, what is the meaning of, “the city is a good place to live”?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Above, at the beginning of this verse.</i> From here [we learn] that a place’s charm is perceived by its inhabitants.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Sotah 47a. Rabbi Yochonon said that there are three types of charm. 1. The charm a place that is perceived by its inhabitants. 2. The charm a woman holds for her husband. 3. The charm of a newly purchased item for its buyer.</i>

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>To the source of the water.</b> From where the water flowed.
<b>And threw salt there.</b> Now is not salt a thing that spoils water? This was a miracle within a miracle.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This miracle was similar to the one performed by Moshe in Marah. After traveling through the wilderness for three days without water, the Bnei Yisroel finally came to a spring only to find the water undrinkably bitter. Moshe threw a tree whose wood was bitter into the water and the water became sweet and drinkable. See Shemos 15:22-26.—Radak</i>

Verse 22



Verse 23

<b>Little boys.</b> Void of <i>mitzvos</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of נְעָרִים קְטַנִּים is “small children,” but obviously this is not the true meaning, because Elisha would never have cursed small children. The word נְעָרִים can also be interpreted as נְעוּרִים [=shaken out or empty] from good deeds. The word קטנים [=little] alludes to how small their faith was. Nonetheless, Elisha was punished for treating them so harshly. See Maseches Sotah 47a. Radak Alternatively, the boys came from a town called נַעֲרָן, which is mentioned in I Divrei Hayomim 7:28 and in Yehoshua 16:7. See below, 5:2.</i>
<b>“Go away, baldy!”</b> “Go away from here, for you have made the place bald for us, [i.e.,] for until now we would be hired to bring sweet water from a distance, and we would earn our livelihood thereby.” But when [the water] became sweet, they lost their livelihood. Thus it is explained in [Maseches] Sotah.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">46b, and see Rashi there.</i>

Verse 24

<b>And saw them.</b> He saw that neither in them nor in their descendants would there be any sap of good deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Shemos 2:12 and Rashi there.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Some say that Elisha saw that their hair was cut in the style of the heathens. He believed that they were degenerate and depraved and foresaw that they would never return to the ways of the Torah. See Maseches Sotah 46b. </i>

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>Yehorom, son of Achov.</b> This section too [in order] to tell the miracle of Meisha the king of Moav, which was performed through Elisha, was written here, for [Scripture] enumerated for Eliyahu eight miracles and for Elisha sixteen, to fulfill “a double amount of your spirit upon me,”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 2:9.</i> and he wrote them all, one juxtaposed to the other. I saw this in the “Thirty-two Methods of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yose Haglili.” And the dividing of the Yardein by Elisha, is [counted] like two of Eliyahu’s miracles.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See above 2:14 and Rashi there.</i>

Verse 2

<b>But not [as bad] as his father and mother.</b> Who added the [worship of the ] Baal in order to provoke [God].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yehorom abolished worship of the Baal but not the Asheiroh because is mother, Izevel, was still alive at the time and she supported Asheiroh worship.—Ralbag</i>

Verse 3

<b>However, to the sins of Yorovom, etc. he cling.</b> And so did all kings of Yisroel, out of fear, so that the kingdom does not return to the House of Dovid if they were to perform the pilgrimage on the [Three] Festival[s]. They, therefore, worshiped the calves.

Verse 4

<b>Owned many flocks.</b> [Targum Yonoson renders,] “owner of livestock.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sheep are usually spotted [= נְקוּדִים], therefore a sheep owner is called נַקָּד.—Radak</i>
<b>Wooly rams.</b> [Targum Yonoson renders,] “pasture-fed rams,” with their wool.

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>Through the road of the wilderness of Edom.</b> For the king of Edom,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He was not a king, but actually a governor that was appointed by the king of Yehudah.—Metzudas Dovid</i> too, will go with us.

Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>To hand them over, etc.</b> For they will die of thirst.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The three kings will be handed over to Moav because either they will die of thirst, or if they scatter across the countryside in search for water, they will be in an unprotected and vulnerable position.—Radak</i>

Verse 11

<b>Who poured water on the hands of Eliyahu.</b> On Mount Carmel,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See I Melochim 18:34 and Rashi there.</i> and with his pouring, his fingers became like springs of water, until the ditch filled up, and it is [therefore] fitting for a miracle to be performed for us through him concerning water.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Yalkot Shimoni 247:214.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, this is an expression to indicate Elisha’s total devotion to Eliyahu to the extent that he even poured water on Eliyahu’s hands. From here we derive that those who serve Torah scholars are greater than those who only study the Torah. See Maseches Berachos 7b.</i>

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>Do not [say that], for Adonoy has called, etc.</b> [Targum Yonoson renders,] “Please [אל]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Gא means “do not,” i.e., “do not tell us these things now, etc.”—Radak</i> do not mention the sins of that wicked woman. Beg mercy for us, for Adonoy has summoned, etc.”

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>Bring me a musician.</b> Because of his anger, the Divine Presence departed from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Pesachim 66b. Alternatively, Elisha was unable to prophesy because he was mourning Eliyahu’s departure. The Divine Presence does not reside with people who are sad. It rests on prophets only when they experience joy in their fulfillment of a <i>mitzvah</i>. See Maseches Pesachim 117a.</i>

Verse 16

<b>Many pools.</b> Ditches full of water.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>This is easy.</b> And furthermore, this miracle is slight and insignificant in the eyes of God, and He will proceed to act wondrously with you and [perform] another miracle, and He will deliver Moav into your hand.

Verse 19

<b>And every valuable tree you will chop down.</b> Even though it is stated, “Do not harm any of its trees,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 20:19.</i> here He permitted it for you, for this is a contemptible and insignificant nation before Him. And so Scripture states, “You shall not pursue their peace and their benefit,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 23:7.</i> [i.e.,] these are the good trees that are among them.
<b>Fertile field.</b> Sown field, <i>koumici</i>, in O.F.

Verse 20

<b>At the time of the morning</b> when the meal-offering was brought up. The water began falling from heaven in the morning<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi is explaining the apparent contradiction between the expressions “morning” and “when the meal-offering was offered up” which refers to the afternoon services. Rashi explains that two expressions refer to the beginning and end of the miracle.</i> in the land of Edom,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, God caused one of the rivers in Edom to overflow its banks causing the valley near the camp to fill with water.—Radak</i> and at the [time of] offering up the meal-offering, it came surging into that valley, because Elisha had said, “You will not see wind and you will not see rain.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 17.</i> [This is stated] in the Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma.

Verse 21

<b>At the border.</b> At the border, that is called <i>marche</i>, in O.F.

Verse 22

<b>Red as blood.</b> Such is the nature of water; when the sun shines on it in the morning, causes it to appear red.
<b>From a distance.</b> At a distance, but because they had never seen water in that valley, they, therefore, thought that it was blood.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25

<b>They demolished the cities.</b> They would destroy the cities.
<b>Each man threw his stone.</b> For they would take stones from the walls until they left all the stones of the walls in the wall, with only their clay,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is Rashi’s explanation of בַּקִּיר חֲרָשֶׂת [=the clay in the wall]. Alternatively, קִיר חֲרָשֶׂת was the name of a mighty fortified city in Moav. Generally, enemy cities would be destroyed after their capture. But, because קִיר חֲרָשֶׂת was a mighty fortified city, they needed catapulters to destroy its wall in order to capture it.—Radak</i> [i.e.,] their mortar; i.e., there were no more stones in the wall. Afterwards, “and the catapulters surrounded it,” and destroyed that which remained in the fields where the wall was not broken, and tore it down.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b>And then took his firstborn son.</b> In the Pesikta of the section of Shekalim it is expounded: He asked his servants, “What is the character of this nation, that miracles such as these were performed for them?” They replied, “Their forefather, Avrohom, had an only son. The Holy One, Blessed Is He, said to him, ‘Offer him before me,’ and he wanted to sacrifice him to the Holy One, Blessed Is He.” He said to them, “I too have a firstborn son. I will go and sacrifice him to the gods.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">There are different opinions whose firstborn son was offered as a burnt offering. Some say that the king of Edom’s firstborn son was in the custody of Moav’s king, and he was burnt by the king of Moav. Others maintain that Meisha, the king of Moav, sacrificed his own son. In Maseches Sanhedrin 39b there are also different opinions whether the firstborn was offered to God or to a heathen deity.—Radak</i>
<b>On the wall.</b> The ‘<i>vav</i>’ [in חֹמָה] is missing,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it should have been spelled חוֹמָה.</i> for he worshiped the sun [=חַמָּה].
<b>This caused a terrible anger.</b> For their iniquities were remembered, that they too worship pagan deities and are not worthy of a miracle.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 39b. </i>

Chapter 4



Verse 1

<b>A wife of one of the disciples of the prophets.</b> She was the wife of Ovadyoh. Every expression of ‘בְּנֵי הַנְּבִיאִים’ [lit., “the sons of the prophets”], in Scripture, is translated [by Targum Yonoson] as, “the disciples of the prophets.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Targum above 2:3, 2:7 and 2:15.</i>
<b>Now the creditor.</b> He was Yehorom, son of Achov, who would lend him with interest, enabling him to sustain the prophets in his father’s time [according to] Midrash Rabbi Tanchuma. Therefore it is stated, “And struck Yehorom between his arms,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Below 9:24.</i> which he stretched out to take interest.

Verse 2

<b>A jar of oil.</b> Enough oil for anointment [=אָסוּךְ], and the ‘א’ is part of the root,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the root is סוך, and the ‘א’ is an added prefix.—Radak</i> like the ‘א’ of, “and my speech [=וְאַחְוָתִי] in your ears,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 13:17.</i> and the ‘א’ of, “the dread [=אִבְחַת] of those struck down by the sword.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 21:20.</i>

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>And close the door.</b> [It affords] respect to the miracle [if] it comes about in secret.
<b>And the full one[s] you shall remove.</b> From before you, and you shall place another vessel in its place to fill it, but you must not move the jug of oil from its place, for the Holy One, Blessed Is He, is making it as a spring, and it is not customary to move a spring from its place.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, she must not move the jug of oil because a miracle continues only in the place where it started.—Radak</i> I heard this Midrash Aggadah.

Verse 5

<b>They would bring [the containers] to her.</b> The vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">They even brought her broken vessels and miraculously they became whole. These too were filled with oil.—Radak</i>

Verse 6

<b>Then the oil stopped.</b> From coming anymore. [According to] Midrash Aggadah, the price of oil went up.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis Rabbah 35:3.</i>

Verse 7

<b>She came and told, etc.</b> She came for advice, whether to sell [the oil] or to wait until it would become even more expensive. He said to her, “Go sell, for there is enough [to pay] all your debt, and for you and your sons to live with the remainder, until the dead are resurrected.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He blessed them with eternal life, i.e., life until the Resurrection of the Dead.—Malbim</i>

Verse 8

<b>There [lived] a prominent woman.</b> [I.e.,] an important [woman]. And I saw in Pirkei of Rabbi Eliezer,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 23.</i> that she was the sister of Avishag the Shunamis.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See I Melochim 1:1-4.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">She is also identified as the mother of Iddo the prophet.—Radak See I Melochim 13:1 and Rashi there.</i>
<b>Thereafter, whenever he passed through.</b> In that city, he would stop at her house to eat a meal.
<b>He would go.</b> [יור is] the present tense, [i.e.,] he would go there.

Verse 9

<b>“Behold, now I know.”</b> Because she never saw a fly at his table or semen on his sheet.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 10b. From here we derive that a woman recognizes her guests better than her husband does.</i>

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>And the day came.</b> And it was one day.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>You have busied yourself with us.</b> On our account.
<b>With all this attention.</b> To put your heart into this task, as in, “and shudders [=וחרד] concerning My word,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 66:2.</i> [i.e.,] is diligent concerning the task that it be accomplished, and puts his heart into it.
<b>What can be done for you?</b> What do you need that we do for you, for you busied yourself on our account.
<b>“In the midst of my people.”</b> Among my relatives, [i.e.,] no one harms me. I have no need for the king or for the general of the army.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, “I dwell among my relatives and they can speak to the king on my behalf if necessary.”—Radak</i>

Verse 14

<b>And he said.</b> Elisha [said] to Geichazi.
<b>“Then what is there to do for her?”</b> To reciprocate for this favor.

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>“At this season [next year]</b> when the time comes to give birth.” Just as you are alive and well today, so will you be alive at this season [next year]<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Elisha was guaranteeing her future health by comparing it to her present state of health. Alternatively, חַיָּה refers to a woman who gives birth and כָּעֵת חַיָּה refers to a nine month span, the normal period of pregnancy. Elisha told her that the baby will be born after fully developing in the womb.—Metzudas Dovid</i> at this time and embracing a son.
<b>“Do not my master.”</b> Do not say, “embracing a son.” Why do I need to embrace him if I will end up burying him?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">She suspected that her son would survive for only a short period because the prophet used the expression “you will be hugging a son” instead of “you will have a son,” the expression used by the angels when they told Avrohom that Sarah will bear him a son. See Bereishis 18:10.—Malbim</i> This is what she said to him when he died, “Did I not say, ‘Do not mislead me’?”
<b>Do not deceive.</b> Do not show me something that will fail. You have power to beg mercy, so that a son will be given to me. But I beg you, do not give me [any child], rather a child who will live.
<b>Do not deceive.</b> Like “whose waters will not fail.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 58:11.</i>

Verse 17

<b>When the time was for her to give birth.</b> Like this time when she was alive and well. Therefore, the word is voweled [to mean], like “this” time.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the ‘כ’ is voweled with a קָמַץ instead of a שְׁוָא.</i>

Verse 18



Verse 19

<b>“My head! My head!”</b> I am sick in my head.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">It is common for those in pain to repeat their cries; see Yirmiyahu 4:19.—Radak</i>
<b>He said.</b> His father said to one of the servants, “Carry him to his mother.”

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22



Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>“Drive and go on.”</b> [I.e.,] hurry.
<b>Do not hold back from riding because of me.</b> Do not hold back the riding [pace] because of me.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Some say she walked alongside the donkey and others say she rode the donkey.—Radak</i>

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>And she said, “[All is] well.”</b> This is an abbreviated verse, for it should have been written, “And he asked her, and she said, ‘We are well.’”

Verse 27



Verse 28

<b>Did I not say.</b> To you, “Do not deceive your maidservant”?<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 16.</i>
<b>“Do not mislead”?</b> Do not mislead me concerning a mistake.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Gא תַשְׁגֶּה means “do not grieve me.”—Targum</i>

Verse 29

<b>Do not greet him.</b> Do not inquire about his welfare. All this [was done] to discourage conversation, where one might ask him, “Where are you going?” and he would say, “To revive the dead.” It is not respectful for the miracle when the maker brags about it. But, he did not obey.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Geichazi took his mission very lightly and considered it a joke. He was therefore unsuccessful in his mission. Radak</i> When anyone asked him [where he was going], he responded, “My master sent me to revive the dead.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Elisha initially thought that the boy had merely fainted and therefore his personal presence would not be necessary.—Malbim</i>

Verse 30



Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33



Verse 34

<b>And he spread himself upon him.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered ‘וְאַלְהֵי עֲלוֹהִי’, an expression of weariness.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “he laid exhausted upon him.”</i> There is a similar word in the Beraisa of Ha’azinu and in Sifrei.

<b>“Strike him down in the chariot, etc.”</b> And in Divrei Hayomim it states, “And he sought Achazyohu, and they captured him when he was hiding in Shomron, and they brought him to Yeihu. ”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 22:9.</i> The verses can be reconciled as follows: “And [he] fled by way of the Beis-Hagan,” from Yizre’el to Shomron, and Yeihu pursued him. There is, however, a discrepancy in the matter, because Yeihu did not reign in Shomron until the following day, as it is explained in this account, “Yeihu wrote letters and sent them to Shomron, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Below 10:1.</i> Our Rabbis explained in the Aggadah [entitled] “Cheilek,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Sanhedrin 102b.</i> “When he was hiding in Shomron,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 22:9.</i> that he would cut out the Divine Names and write [names of] pagan deities in their place. According to their opinion, one can say that his hiding was not because of Yeihu, rather the following is its explanation: “And he sought Achazyohu, and they captured him when he was escaping by way of the garden.” He had been acting wickedly from the beginning, for he would come to Shomron and hide from the officers of Yehudah, to commit this abomination, because the inhabitants of Shomron were idolaters. “And they brought him to Yeihu,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> [i.e.,] Yeihu’s men, who had pursued him, [after which it states,] “And he said, ‘Strike him in the chariot.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Achazyohu was wounded on the way up to Gur, and he fled to Megido where his condition worsened. The verse therefore uses the expression וַיָמָת [literally=“and he died”] to express his condition although he was still alive. See I Shmuel 25:37 where “וַיָמָת” is used to express the condition of a live person. He then went to hide in Shomron where he was discovered by Yeihu’s men. They brought Achazyohu to Yeihu in Yizre’el and he was executed there.—Radak</i>

Verse 29

<b>In the eleventh year of Yorom, son of Achov, Achazyoh became king.</b> Above it states, “In the twelfth year.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">8:25.</i> And you are forced [to say] that Yehorom his father died in the twelfth year of Yorom, because he became king in the fifth year of Yorom and he reigned for eight years. Why then does it say here, “In the eleventh year”? I say that he reigned one year during his father’s lifetime because he was afflicted with severe maladies, as it is stated, “And after all this, Adonoy afflicted him [in his intestines] with incurable illness, and it was at the end of a year … his intestines came out because of his illness, etc.,”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 21:18-19.</i> “and the inhabitants of Yerusholayim made king—Achazyohu.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 22:1.</i> Here it states, “Achazyohu was twenty-two years old when he became king,”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Above 8:26.</i> but in Divrei Hayomim [it states], “He was forty-two years old when he reigned.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 22:2.</i> Yehorom, his father, lived for forty years, no more, as it is stated, concerning him, “He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years [in Yerusholayim].”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Above 8:17.</i> How then is it possible for a son to be two years older than his father? Rather, twenty years before he was born, which is two years before his father was born, this decree was issued. From the day that Asa took Omri’s daughter in marriage for Yehoshophot his son, a decree was issued upon the House of Dovid that it be destroyed with the House of Achov. And similarly it states, “And from God [it was decreed] for the ruination of Achazyohu, that he come to Yorom, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 22:7.</i> Thus it is taught in Seder Olam and in the Tosefta of [Maseches] Sotah.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">12:3.</i> However, in all of Scripture, we do not find that Yehoshophot married Omri’s daughter. However, I did find in Divrei Hayomim, “And he intermarried with Achov.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 18:1.</i> Perhaps this [refers to] his sister whom he married. He married her in the thirty-first year of Asa, as it is stated, “In the thirty-first year of the reign of Asa, [King of Yehudah], Omri reigned [over Yisroel].”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 16:23.</i> And we learned in Seder Olam that he reigned over the entire kingdom, for six years before then he reigned over half the people, and when Asa took his [Imri’s] daughter in marriage to [his son] Yehoshophot, Imri gained prestige, and they assassinated Tivni. Proceed and calculate from the thirty-first year of Asa until Achazyohu’s death and you will find them to be forty-two [years].

Verse 8

<b>In the thirty-eighth year of Azaryohu king of Yehudah, Zecharyoh … became king.</b> From here too, it is possible to deduce that Azaryoh[u] reigned from the time that Yoash king of Yisroel died, fifteen years during the lifetime of Amatzyoh his father, for if he did not become [king] until his father died, it follows that he did not become [king] until the fifteenth year of Yorovom son of Yoash. Now, since Yorovom reigned forty-one years, it follows that Yorovom died in the twenty-seventh year of Uzziyoh. So, how does [Scripture] state, “In the thirty-eighth year?” Rather, we are forced [to deduce] that Uzziyoh and Yorovom reigned simultaneously, except that Yorovom reigned during the lifetime of his father Yehoash—three years. Therefore [Scripture] states, ”and Yorovom had sat on his throne,”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 13:13.</i> [i.e., on the throne] that he had already sat. And Uzziyoh became [king] when Yoash died and Yorovom reigned over a complete monarchy. I saw in Seder Olam that Yorovom reigned one year during his father's lifetime, and I do not know whether it is the writers' error, for I cannot reconcile, ”In the thirty-eighth year of Azaryohu … Zecharyohu … reigned,” except in this manner.

<b>In the twelfth year of Achaz, etc.</b> It is impossible to say that Hoshei'a became king in the twelfth year of Achaz, because in the fourth year of Achaz, he assassinated Pekach and reigned in his place,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 15:30.</i> and when you examine Pekach's years you will find it so. Likewise, it is impossible to say that he reigned for only nine years, for he reigned from the fourth year of Achaz until the sixth year of Chizkiyohu, when Shomron was conquered, and this amounts to more than sixteen years. What then is the meaning of “nine years”? [It was nine years] since he rebelled against the king of Ashur. This is what is learned in Seder Olam. And it is impossible to say that in the twelfth year of Achaz he started to rebel, for if so, you will find the years of his revolt five years during the days of Achaz and six years during the days of Chizkiyohu, making [a total of] eleven years, yet here he states [that he reigned] nine [years]. ”The twelfth year of Achaz” was mentioned only in connection with the verse following, ”Shalmaneser [king Ashur] went up against him, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Below, v. 3.</i> [i.e.,] that in the twelfth year of Achaz, Sancheiriv went up against Hoshei'a and exiled those who were on the eastern bank of the Yardein.

The ten tribes were exiled at three different times: [The first exile was] in the twentieth year of Pekach, as it is written above, ”Tiglas Pileser the king of Ashur came and took Iyon and Dan, etc., and the entire land of Naphtoli and exiled them to Ashur.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayomim 5:26.</i> Now this was the fourth year of Achaz.

But, when Hoshei'a son of Eilah saw this, he revolted against him and sent messengers to So the king of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See above, 15:29. In our editions, however, Dan is not mentioned in the verse.</i> [And the third exile] he waited eight years and came and laid siege on Shomron. After three years it was conquered, and everyone was exiled. This is [the meaning of] what is written, ”Like the first time, he dealt mildly, the land of Zevulun and the land of Naphtoli,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 8:23.</i> so did he deal mildly<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">By exiling only two tribes.</i> also in the second [exile], for he exiled but two tribes. But, “in the last one, he swept,” [i.e.,] he swept everything out like one who sweeps a house. In any case, according to the amount he wrote here as the number of years of his revolt, [i.e.,] nine years, he did not revolt against him until the fourteenth year of Achaz, for Achaz reigned sixteen years; the revolt was during three years of Achaz['s reign] and six years during the days of Chizkiyohu['s reign].

Verse 2

<b> But not like the kings of Yisroel.</b> For he abolished the sentries who were stationed on the roads from the days of Yorovom, to guard against the [Bnei] Yisroel from going up and performing the pilgrimage for the festivals, and this one abolished them,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He abolished the sentries on the fifteenth day of Menachem Av, and therefore that day was proclaimed a minor holiday. See Maseches Taanis 30b.—Radak Hoshei'a 10:6.</i> because the golden calves had already been exiled in the two [previous] exiles. In the first exile, [it states,] “he took Iyon and Dan,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See above 15:29.</i> [i.e.,] he exiled the calf that was in Dan.

This is what Hoshei'a the son of Be'eiri said, ”For now you have gone astray, Ephrayim, Yisroel has become defiled.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 5:3.

Dovid who was Chizkiyohu's ancestor, incurred guilt by causing the deaths of the <i>kohanim</i> of Nov, and it was therefore decreed that his descendants would be liable for punishment for many years.

Verse 9

<b>Should the shade advance ten steps or should it go back ten steps?</b> This is an abbreviated verse. The shade had already advanced the steps that are made [to measure] the hours of the day, like, <i>oriloje</i>, in O. F., the clocks that people make to determine the hour of the day.

Verse 10

<b>And Chizkiyohu said, ”It is easier for the shade to advance ten steps.”</b> It is easy [for the shade] to remain in its place, and stay for ten steps, it is not something that is so conspicuous. Not so, rather let the shade go back, and the event will be a wonder, for they saw that the day was turning toward evening, and it returns to become morning [again].

Verse 11

The verse there states, “Nevuchadnetzar king of Bavel attacked him [Yehoyakim] and bound him in chains to take him to Bavel.”</i> that Nevuchadnetzar bound him to take him to Bavel.

Verse 7

<b>Left his land.</b> To aid Yehoyakim.
<b>For the king of Bavel had taken, etc.</b> For he defeated him in battle in the fourth year of Yehoyakim in Charchemish on the Euphrates River, as it is written in the Book of Yirmiyohu.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">46:2.</i>

Verse 14

<b>Craftsmen and gatekeepers.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered the craftsmen and the sentries of the gates. But, our Rabbis said that these were great Torah scholars,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “craftsmen and gatekeepers” is a metaphoric allusion to Torah scholars. See Maseches Sanhedrin 38a.</i> that when one would begin [to speak], all remained silent [=חרש], as it is written, “Be silent before Me, O islands.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 41:1.</i> ”מסגר” [is one who] all sit before him and learn from him, as it is stated, ”And he will open, and no one will close, and he will close, and no one will open.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 22:22.</i> <sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Gittin 88a.</i>

Verse 15

<b>And the dignitaries of the land.</b> These are the dignitaries of Yehudah and Binyomin, who were righteous men. Concerning them Scripture states, ”Like these good figs, so will I recognize the exiles of Yehudah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 24:5.</i>

Verse 16

<b>Seven thousand.</b> But above he states, “ten thousand.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Above, v. 14.</i> The third verse comes to reconcile [the difference], in the Book of Yirmiyohu, ”This is the people whom Nevuchadnetzar exiled in the seventh year, three thousand Jews.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 52:28. The verse there states, “three thousand and <i>twenty-three</i> Jews.”</i> We deduce from here that three thousand were of the tribe of Yehudah and seven thousand were of Binyomin and the other tribes. Also in Seder Olam we learned this.

When Nevuchadnetzar came back he imprisoned his son. Evil Merodach wanted to make sure that would not happen again, and he therefore had Nevuchadnetzar's body removed from his grave and dragged along the ground, thus fulfilling Yeshayohu's prophecy.—Radak</i> in order to nullify his decrees, as it is stated in Yeshayohu, ”and you have been cast out of your grave like a despised sapling, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 14:19.</i>
