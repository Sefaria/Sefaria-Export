Rashi on I Samuel



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>And there was a man.</b> It all follows the order: Moshe gave over the Torah to Yehoshua and Yehoshua to the Elders and each Judge to his successor until it reached Eili who gave it over to Shmuel<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the “<span>ו</span>” of <span>וְאֵלֶה</span> links the Book of Shmuel with the preceeding Book of Shoftim and serves as a link between the oral tradition as stated in the Mishnah, “…and the Elders…”</i> as we learned (in the Mishnah), "… and the Elders [gave it over] to the Prophets…"<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Avos 1:1.</i>
<b>From Ramasayim Tsofim.</b> There were two hills each visible to the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Elkonoh lived in Romoh, see below verse 19; and he prophesied in Tsofim—Da’as Sofrim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Megillah 14a.</i> Targum Yonoson renders <span>צוֹפִים</span>: "of the disciples of prophets."
<b>Elkonoh.</b> He was a Levite of the sons of Aviosof, the son of Korach —his ancestry is thus recorded in Divrei Hayomim.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayomim 6:19-23.</i>
<b>From the land of Ephrayim.</b> [Targum] Yonoson renders "on the mountain of the house of Ephrayim." The Midrash Aggadah [renders] <span>אֶפְרָתִי</span> —a palace dweller, an important person,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi emphasizes that <span>אֶפְרָתִי</span> does not mean that he was from the tribe of Ephrayim because it has already been established that he was from the tribe of Leivi.</i> as in "let us extend <span>אַפִּרְיוֹן</span> to Rabbi Shimon,"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Bava Metzia 119a.</i> [meaning] an expression of favor.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>This man would go up.</b> This is the present tense, i.e., he would go up from one appointed season to another, to Shilo.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He would go to Shiloh on the three pilgrimage festivals of Pesach, Shavuos and Sukkos.</i> The Midrash Aggadah [renders] that the route he followed this year he did not take the next year in order to publicize [his pilgrimage] to the Bnei Yisroel that they should do likewise.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Yerushalmi, Berachos 9:5.</i>

Verse 4

<b>It happened on the day.</b> It happened on the festive day.

Verse 5

<b>One choice portion.</b> One choice portion which is fit to be accepted with a friendly countenance.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><span>אַפָּיִם</span> referring to the face rather than to the portion. Ralbag renders “a double sized portion.”</i>

Verse 6

<b>Her rival.</b> Her husband's other wife, Penina.
<b>Frequently anger.</b> Anger after anger, i.e., always.' Therefore it is written 'also [<span>גֵם</span>] anger.' She would say to her, "Did you buy your older son a cloak today, or your younger son, a shirt?"
<b>In order that she should complain.</b> In order to make her complain. Our Rabbis explain, 'in order to make her storm,' that she pray. Penina had good intentions.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> Maseches Bava Basra 16a.</i>
<b>Her womb.</b> Lit., opposite her womb, and so is every expression of the word <span>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, Bereishis 7:16.</i></span><span>בְּעַד</span>

Verse 7

<b>He would do this.</b> Elkonoh.
<b>Year after year.</b> He would give her a choice portion to demonstrate to her that he loved her; and her rival, according to the affection which her husband demonstrated to her, would anger her more and more.

Verse 8

<b>Am I not better to you.</b> Don't I love you more dearly.
<b>Than ten sons.</b> That Penina has borne to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Others interpret that Elkonoh did not mean literally ten sons and with reference to Penina, but rather he was expressing his love to Chana and happened to pick that number , as we find the same number in Vayikra 26:26.—Radak</i>

Verse 9

<b>Eating in Shilo.</b> The '<span>ה</span>' is not dotted and the '<span>א</span>' is voweled with a short <i>kametz</i> and its [meaning is] 'after eating in Shilo and after drinking,'<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Eili therefore suspected that she was drunk because prayer usually takes place before eating or drinking—Da’as Sofrim.</i> and this expression is properly used both for masculine and feminine. After <span>אָכְלָה</span> is a gerund. It is constructed like <span>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 25:6.</i></span><span>לְאָכְלָה</span> an expression equivalent to an infinitive [i.e., <span>לֶאֶכוֹל</span>].
<b>And Eili the kohen was sitting on the chair.</b> On that day he was seated on a large chair,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The defective spelling of <span>ישֵׁב</span> [instead of <span>יוֹשֵׁב</span>] indicates that he just recently sat down because he was a newly appointed judge. See Rashi Bereishis 19:1.</i> for he was appointed Judge over Yisroel.
<b>Near the doorpost.</b> [Lit. on the doorpost] meaning near the doorpost.

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>Adonoy of Hosts.</b> Why was this Name designated here? She [Chana] said before Him, "Lord of the universe, You created two hosts in Your world. The heavenly beings neither multiply nor do they die; the earthly beings both multiply and die. If I am of the earthly beings, let me multiply and die, and if I am of the heavenly beings, let me not die." I found [this explanation] in the Aggadah of R. Eliezer the son of R. Yose Haglili. Our Rabbis in Maseches Berachos,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"></i> expounded what they expounded: —Until then, there was no one person who called the Holy One, Blessed is He, [Master of] Hosts. She said thus before Him; "Lord of the universe, of all the hosts which You created in Your world, is it difficult for you to grant me one son?"
<b>If You look at.</b> In Maseches Berachos,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> our Sages expounded what they expounded.
<b>Your maidservant.</b> [The word 'maidservant'] is stated three times in this verse, corresponding to the three mitzvos which a woman is commanded to observe.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">They are the laws of: 1. Menstruation <span>.2</span> <span>נִדָּה</span> Separation of the dough <span>.3</span> <span>חַלָּה</span> Kindling of the Shabbos lights [<span>הַדְלָקַת הַנֵּר</span>].</i>
<b>Male offspring.</b> I.e., righteous men, as it is written, "Two men [<span>אֲנָשִׁים</span>] who were righteous."<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">I Melachim 2:32.</i>
<b>Males.</b> I.e., important men,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> See Maseches Berachos 31b.</i> as it is written, "wise… and known men <span>]</span><span>אֲנָשִׁים</span><span>[</span>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 1:13.</i>
<b>Then I will give him to Adonoy.</b> I.e., that he be fit to be given to Adonoy.
<b>And a razor.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Nazir 66a where the very same difference of opinion is discussed. R. Nehorai renders <span>מוֹרָה</span> meaning a razor as Scripture states regarding Shimshon, in Shoftim 13:5, “the razor [<span>מוֹרָה</span>] must not be wielded on his head.” And R. Yose holds that [<span>מוֹרָה</span>] is a connotation referring to the fear of man.</i></b> Targum Yonoson renders, "and the fear [<span>וּמַרְוַת</span>] of man will not be upon him."

Verse 12

<b>Watched her mouth.</b> He waited for her to stop, as Targum Yonoson renders, 'and Eili waited until she stopped.'
<b>Watched.</b> An expression of waiting, as in, "[and his father] kept the matter in mind <span>]</span><span>שָׁמַר</span><span>[</span>"<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 37:11.</i> i.e., waited, [and similarly] "do not wait [<span>תִשְׁמוֹר</span>] for my sin."<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 14:16.</i>

Verse 13

<b>Eili thought she was drunk.</b> Because they were not accustomed to praying silently.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>No, my lord.</b> You are not master in this matter. You have revealed that the Holy Spirit is not resting upon you, otherwise you would have known that I am not intoxicated from wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 31b.</i>

Verse 16

<b>Do not deliver your maidservant.</b> Because she had spoken harshly to him, she tried to appease him, so that he deliver her not, unprotected and disgraced, to her rival, the wicked woman.
<b>For it is out of much grievance.</b> That I have spoken harshly to you.
<b>Grievance.</b> In some instances, it [<span>שִֹיחִי</span>] is an expression of heartache. Another explanation of <span>מֵרֹב שִֹיחִי</span>, according to Targum, "because of much provocation and anger, I have prolonged my prayer until now."
<b>And anger.</b> My rival angers me.
<b>Do not deliver.</b> An expression of giving over, as in, "'Do not deliver me to the will of my tormentors."<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 27:12.</i>

Verse 17

<b>Your request.</b> The <span>א</span> is missing, to infer [<span>שֵׁלָתֵךְ</span>] an expression of children,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Others render <span>שֵׁלָתֵך</span> as being derived from <span>שָׁלָל</span> [=plunder], meaning that her soon to be born son will “take of the goods [<span>שָׁלָל</span> of the Torah,” i.e., he will gain much knowledge and understanding of the Torah.—Radak</i> as in, "and her young [<span>וּבְשִׁלְיָתָהּ</span>] who emerges from…."<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 28:57.</i>
<b>Will grant the request.</b> He foretold to her that her prayer had been accepted.

Verse 18

<b>May your maidservant find favor.</b> To beg for compassion on her behalf.
<b>And no longer had the [sad] look on her face.</b> Meaning the face of anger.

Verse 19

<b>And came to their home… and Elkonoh knew.</b> From here [we learn] that a traveler is forbidden to have marital relations.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Kesubos 65a.</i>

Verse 20

<b>And as the seasons and days passed.</b> The minimum of seasons [<span>תְּקוּפוֹת</span>] is two, and the minimum of days [<span>יָמִים</span>] is two. Hence, [she gave birth] after six months [=two seasons] and two days.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Rosh Hashanah 11a.</i> From here [we learn] that a woman who gives birth in her seventh month of pregnancy, can give birth after entering part of the seventh month.
<b>Shmuel.</b> After the Name of God [<span>א־ל</span>], and in reference to the incident he was so called, for I requested [<span>שָׁאַל</span>] him of <span>הַשֵׁם</span><span>[</span>=<span>מא־ל</span>].

Verse 21

<b>The festival offering.</b> [Targum renders] the sacrifices of the appointed seasons.
<b>And his vow.</b> The vows he made between festivals he would offer on the next festival.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 6a.</i>

Verse 22

<b>When [the boy] will be weaned.</b> At the end of twenty-two (other versions, twenty-four) months, for that is the period for a child to nurse.
<b>And shall remain there forever.</b> Forever in the Levitic sense,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">It can also refer to the fifty year period of Yoveil.</i> i.e., fifty years as it is said, "from the age of fifty he shall retire from the work force."<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 8:25.</i> Figuring as follows, we determine that Shmuel's lifetime was fifty-two years: Eili judged Yisroel for forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 4:18.</i> On the day of Chana's prayer he was appointed judge.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Above verse 9.</i> By subtracting the year in which Chana conceived Shmuel, there remain thirty-nine years. Shmuel governed Yisroel from the time of Eili's death for thirteen years, as follows: On the day of Eili's death, the Ark was captured, and it remained in the land of the Philistines for seven months.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Below 6:1.</i> From there, it was brought to and remained in Kiryas Yearim until Dovid brought it up after he had reigned seven years in Chevron over Yehudah, and all of Yisroel had accepted him as their king. And it is written, "From the day the Ark came to rest in Kiryas Yearim, there ensued many days, and they became twenty years."<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 7:2.</i> Subtracting from them seven years which Dovid reigned in Chevron discloses that from the time the Ark was captured until Shaul's death, were thirteen years and seven months; and Shmuel died four months before Shaul.

Verse 23

<b>But may Adonoy fulfill His word.</b> Because you requested of Him male offspring,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Above, verse 11.</i> and Eili foretold you through Divine inspiration, "the God of Yisroel will grant your request,"<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Above, verse 17.</i> may '<span>ה</span> fulfill His word. This is the simple interpretation. In Midrash Aggadah, however, Rabbi Nechemyah said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel, the son of Rabbi Yitzchok: Every day a Divine voice would resound throughout the world and say, "A righteous man is destined to arise, by the name of Shmuel." Thereupon, every woman who bore a son, would name him Shmuel. Once they saw his deeds, they would say, "This is not [the] Shmuel." But when this one [Shmuel] was born and people saw his deeds, they said, "Apparently this one is the one [i.e., expected righteous man]." This is what he [Elkonoh] meant when he said, "May Adonoy fulfill His word," i.e., that this be the righteous Shmuel.

Verse 24

<b>One <i>eiphah</i> of flour.</b> I heard in the name of Rabbi Yitzchok Halevi, that she brought one <i>eiphah</i> of flour, the equivalent of three <i>seahs,</i> from which to extract three tenths of an <i>eiphah</i> of fine flour, the required amount for one bull.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Bamidbar 15:8-9.</i> As we learned in the Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Menachos 76b.</i> The showbread was made of twenty-four tenths of an <i>eiphah</i> from twenty-four <i>seahs;</i> i.e., one tenth part of an <i>eiphah</i> of fine flour from each <i>seah</i> of wheat.
<b>And a flask of wine.</b> For a libation.
<b>Though the child was still a lad.</b> The Targum renders, 'though the child was still young.'

Verse 25

<b>They brought the child to Eili.</b> To show that his prophecy was fulfilled. Our Sages expounded what they expounded, explaining that he [Shmuel] ruled on a point of law, that a kohein is not necessary for sacrificial slaughter, as it is stated in [Maseches] Berachos.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"> 31b.</i>

Verse 26

<b>Please my lord.</b> Take care of him, that he become your disciple. But according to the Midrash of our Sages, [she asked of Eili] not to punish him with death.

Verse 27

<b>This is the child that I prayed for.</b> Do not say, "this one shall die and another shall be given to you."<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>

Verse 28

<b>And I have dedicated him to Adonoy.</b> Just as a person who lends a utensil to his master, or lends him his son to serve him.
<b>He is dedicated.</b> <i>Enpruntez</i> in Old French, i.e., you have no right to punish him, for the Holy one, Blessed is He, has become his borrower; because I have lent [Shmuel] to Him, He must return him to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Another interpretation of “<span>שָׁאוּל</span>” is that it refers to Shaul. She stated by Divine inspiration, “as long as Shmuel lives, Shaul will live.” Shmuel was no longer alive at the time of Shaul’s death.</i>
<b>He then prostrated himself.</b> Shmuel. Others say, Elkonoh.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>My mouth is enlarged.</b> Against Penina.

Verse 2

<b>And there is no stronghold like our God.</b> There is no artist<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Rashi disregards the usual rendering of <span>צוֹר</span> [=Rock], which represents the awesome powers of ‘<span>ה</span> Who is able to change the laws of nature. Seen Devarim 32:4.</i> [<span>צַיָר</span>] like our God Who fashions a form within a form.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 10a.</i>

Verse 3

<b>Do not abound in speaking so very proudly.</b> All those who are haughty when they experience good fortune. About Penina who behaved haughtily toward her, was she speaking, according to the simple explanation. However, according to the <i>drash,</i> we follow Targum Yonoson's rendition [that she is referring to Nevuchadnetzar].
<b>Harshness.</b> Strong speech. Others explain <span>עָתָק</span> as an expression of something which is removed [from the truth], as in "from there he moved [<span>וַיַעְתֵּק</span>] to the mountain."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 12:8.</i> [The meaning here being "let not] falsehood come out of your mouth."
<b>For a God of knowledge is Adonoy.</b> He knows what is in your hearts.
<b>And by Him all actions are counted.</b> All people's deeds are counted before Him.
<b>Counted.</b> An expression of number, as in, "and the number [<span>וְתֹכֶן</span>] of bricks shall you give."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 5:18.</i>

Verse 4

<b>The bows of the mighty are broken…</b> This is the custom of the Holy One, Blessed is He. He weakens the mighty and strengthens the weak, He sates the hungry and starves the sated.

Verse 5

<b>The sated have hired themselves out for bread.</b> [The sated] who do not need to hire themselves out for any work, He starves them and they must hire themselves out for bread,
<b>And the hungry</b> Who would toil and weary themselves for food.
<b>Have ceased.</b> From their toil.
<b>Until the barren has born seven and she with many children….</b> While the barren woman has born seven,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> Others interpret that the seven children mentioned are not literally seven and with reference to Peninah, but rather it is an expression that means “many children.” See above 1:8.—Radak</i> she that had many children has been bereaved and buries her children. Chana bore seven as it is stated, "For Adonoy remembered Chana and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters." When Chana bore one, Penina buried two.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Below verse 21.</i> Penina had ten children as it is stated, "Am I not better to you than [the] ten sons of Penina?"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Above 1:8.</i> When Chana bore four, Penina buried eight. When she [Chana] conceived and bore a fifth child, Penina prostrated herself at her feet and begged for mercy and they lived and were therefore considered as hers. This is R. Nechemya's opinion. R. Yehudah however says that grandchildren are considered as children. Some are of the opinion that the numerical value of <span>שִׁבְעָה</span><span>(</span>377<span>)</span> is equivalent to that of <span>שְׁמוּאֵל</span><span>(</span>377<span>)</span>.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

<b>His pious ones.</b> It is spelled <span>חֲסִידוֹ</span> "His pious <i>one"</i> but read <span>חֲסִידָיו</span> "His pious <i>ones,"</i> [meaning] whether a single one or many. Similarly "may His adversaries be broken." [The reading is <span>מְרִיבָיו</span> "His adversaries" but] the spelling is <span>מְרִיבוֹ</span> "His adversary," meaning whether a single adversary or many.

Verse 10

<b>Let Him thunder against them from heaven.</b> The spelling is <span>עָלוּ</span> "they have ascended" meaning that even if they have ascended to the heavens, He thunders upon them and casts them down.
<b>May Adonoy judge the ends of the earth.</b> He judges and punishes them. <i>Justisier</i> in O. F.

Verse 11

<b>Served Adonoy in the presence of Eili the kohein.</b> From here [our Sages conclude] that "whoever serves before a Torah scholar is considered as though he had served before the Divine Presence."<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi Eruvin 5:1. The reason being that a Torah scholar cleaves to ‘<span>ה</span> in his thoughts at all times so that even his physical activities are holy.</i>

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>The custom of the kohanim.</b> They established this law for themselves, since they rightfully inherited only the breast and the thigh of the peace offering.

Verse 14

<b>Pot.</b> Fire pot.
<b>Pan.</b> Cauldron.
<b>Bowl.</b> Pan.

Verse 15



Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>They had disgraced.</b> Meaning despised.

Verse 18

<b>A lad girded with a linen robe.</b> [Targum renders] "<span>כַּרְדּוּט</span> of linen," meaning a robe, for Targum Yonoson renders <span>מְעִילִים</span> in the passage <span>כִּי כֵן תִּלְבַּשְׁנָה הַבְּתוּלוֹת מְעִילִים</span> "for such so <span>מְעִילִים</span> were worn by the maidens…",<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 13:18.</i> as <span>כַּרְדוּטִין</span>.

Verse 19

<b>His mother would make for him a small robe.</b> From year to year.

Verse 20

<b>Eili would then bless them.</b> This is the present tense, i.e., he would bless him every year.
<b>Because of the request that he had made.</b> For himself a son. [Eili] would say to him, "May <span>השם</span> grant you seed, etc., i.e., may it be the Divine Will that all the children that you will have, will be from this righteous woman. This is an inverted sentence.

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>That they would lie.</b> The explanation is according to the simple sense. Our Rabbis however said<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In Maseches Yoma 9a-b.</i> that since they delayed [the sacrifice of] their birds<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> See Vayikra 15:29 and 22:6-8.</i> and they would wait until they would see their birds being offered, Scripture charges them as though they had lain with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Shabbos 55b. Metzudas Dovid translates this phrase as “they would cause the women who assembled at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to sleep there,” thereby not allowing them to return to their homes and husbands.</i>

Verse 23



Verse 24

<b>That I hear being passed on by Adonoy's people.</b> The rumor which <span>השם</span>'s people are spreading about you, an expression similar to, "and they proclaimed [<span>וַיַעֲבִירוּ</span>] throughout the camp;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 36:6.</i> meaning, they let out a rumor about you which is not good.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Although it was only a rumor, kohanim are held accountable even for an appearance of impropriety.</i>

Verse 25

<b>Tries him.</b><span>וּפִלְלוֹ</span> is an expression of judgment, as in, "and he shall pay by order of the judges <span>]</span><span>פְלִילִים</span><span>[</span>."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 21:22.</i>
<b>Judge.</b> The judge.
<b>For it was Adonoy's will to kill them.</b> For their verdict had already been sealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Rosh Hashanah 18b.</i> Before the verdict is sealed however, Scripture states, "for I do not desire the death of one who should die."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 27:32.</i>

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b>The man of God came.</b> This was Elkonoh.
<b>Have I not repeatedly revealed Myself to your ancestor's family.</b> From here [our Sages concluded] that Aharon prophesied in Egypt. What was the prophecy? It is stated, "and I said to them, 'Every man, cast away the detestable idols of his eyes, do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt.'"<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 20:7.</i>
<b>Have I not repeatėdly revealed Myself.</b> Did you know that this favor and greatness I gave to Aharon.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ralbag interprets this phrase as an affirmative statement, i.e., “I did indeed reveal myself to the…”</i>

Verse 28



Verse 29

<b>Which I commanded you [to bring in My] Sanctuary.</b> Which I commanded in My dwelling place.
<b>To feed yourselves from the choice parts…</b> This is an inverted sentence [meaning], "you honor your sons more than Me ," <span>]</span><span>לְעַמִּי</span><span>[</span> before My people, i.e., in the eyes of My people, you honor your sons more than Me. And what is the honor? To feed yourselves from the choice parts of all the offerings of Yisroel. Your meal preceded My meal, as it is stated, "even before they would burn the fat…"<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Above verse 15.</i>
<b>To feed yourselves.</b> [<span>לְהַבְרִיאֲכֶם</span>] is an expression of having a meal, as in, "Please let my sister Tamar come and serve [<span>וְתַבְרֵנִי</span>] me bread."<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"> II Shmuel 13:5.</i>
<b>My people.</b> This reverts to, "you honor your sons more than Me." You showed My people that you are more honored than I. And how have you shown this? By feeding yourselves from the choice parts of My offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">It may also be interpreted as referring to the part of the sacrifice that belonged to the people who brought the offering, that Eili’s sons took for themselves.</i>

Verse 30

<b>I had indeed decreed.</b> Twice I assigned greatness to the sons of Isomor: Concerning the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori, it is stated, "Under the direction of Isomor, the son of Aharon the kohein."<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> Bamidbar 4:33.</i> And Eili was one of the descendants of Isomor. This [explanation] I saw in Midrash Shmuel. I have, however, heard a more fitting explanation: "I had indeed decreed that your family and your father's family…" Originally I made Elozor the kohein to serve as kohein gadol, as it is stated, "remove Aharon's vestments, [and dress Elozor his son in them]."<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 20:26.</i> However, at the time of the concubine,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"> See Shoftim Chapters 19-21.</i> Yisroel divested themselves of most mitzvos. And who was to blame [for this]? Pinchas and his associate kohanim, who should have gone around from city to city to reprove them. I therefore took the <i>kehunah gedolah</i> away from them, and gave it to you, for you are of Isomor's descendants, and I said, that they shall walk before Me forever; for when greatness is assigned to a person, it is assigned to him and to his generations forever.

<b>Prophetic vision was not widespread.</b> Prophecy was not revealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Not only were prophetic visions rare in those days, but even when they occurred they were not clear and concise, but rather cryptic and vague. Also, the prophecy that was received was of a private nature and not required by the people, so there was no need to reveal those visions.

Verse 3

<b>And Shmuel was lying.</b> In his place, in the court of the Levites who watch in the Temple. According to Targum Yonoson: "And Shmuel was lying in the court of the Levites."
<b>In the Temple of Adonoy.</b> Where the Ark of God was.

Verse 4

<b>Adonoy called.</b> And a voice emanated from the Temple of God, from the Holy of Holies, which called, "Shmuel!"

Verse 7

<b>[Shmuel] had not yet known Adonoy.</b> He had not yet recognized the nature of the prophetic voice.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He was thus unfamiliar with the ways ‘<span>ה</span> calls man, and he therefore thought that the voice was Eili’s.</i> Every time the word '<span>טֶרֶם</span>' appears in Scripture, it means 'not yet,' as rendered by the Targum '<span>עַד לָא</span>' [not yet]. It does not mean 'before.' This verse proves it. And another [proof of this] is the verse <span>כִּי טֶרֶם תִּירְאוּן</span> which is rendered as "that you do not yet fear,"<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 9:30.</i> is a more explicit verse proving this.

Verse 13

<b>That his sons were blaspheming themselves.</b> It should properly state, 'blaspheming Me' but Scripture euphemized.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> See Mechilta Beshalach 15:7 for a listing of other places where Scripture euphemized out of reverence to ‘<span>ה</span>. Ralbag, however, interprets this verse that “they [Bnei Yisroel] cursed them [the sons of Eili].”</i>
<b>Blaspheming.</b> Meaning, acting irreverantly, and similarly, every curse [<span>קְלָלָה</span>] is an expression of irreverence and disgrace.
<b>He did not censure.</b> I.e., he did not darken [<span>כהה</span>] their faces by removing them from their high positions.

Verse 1

<b>The word of Shmuel went out to all of Yisroel.</b> The word which was said to Shmuel, was fulfilled, and came to all Yisroel. How did this misfortune befall them?

What disturbed Shmuel was that the motive behind the request was not a desire to fulfill a mitzvah of appointing a king.

Menachem, however, explains <span>תְּשׁוּרָה</span> as an expression of a tribute for the privilege of seeing a king or an important person; [<span>תְּשׁוּרָה</span> being] an expression related to <span>אֲשׁוּרֶנּוּ</span> [meaning] 'I behold them,'<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 24:17.</i> and I agree with his explanation.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That <span>וּתְשׁוּרָה</span> is from the root <span>שוּר</span> [=to see].</i>

Verse 9

<b>In former times in Yisroel.</b> The author wrote this verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Shmuel. See Maseches Bava Basra 14b which states that Shmuel authored the Book of Shmuel. However, being that Shmuel died before Shaul who only reigned for two years, what is the meaning of “formerly” and “of today” as stated in the verse? Radak therefore suggests that “formerly” refers to an earlier period when prophets were known for their ability to predict the future and to display a knowledge of hidden things, therefore the term <span>רוֹאֶה</span>. However, in Shmuel’s time prophecy became widespread, but the type of prophecy was a Divine inspiration to bring to the people the word of ‘<span>ה</span>, therefore the term <span>נָבִיא</span> [from the root <span>בוֹא</span>]. In Shaul’s case he was looking for a <span>רוֹאֶה</span> to tell him where his donkeys were. Others however, maintain that the author of this verse may have been Ezra or Yirmiyahu.</i> i.e., this is not part of the youth of Shaul's statement.
<b>For the "prophet" of today.</b> The one who is called 'prophet' today was formerly called 'seer.'

Verse 20

<b>I will shoot in that direction.</b> This is not a dotted <span>ה׳</span>.

Verse 21

<b>Behold, I will then send…</b> And it is customary for the one who is looking for a shot arrow to go to the place where he sees the arrow flying, but he cannot calculate exactly; sometimes he searches for it, and the arrow is beyond him, and sometimes he goes beyond the arrow and searches for it, and you shall divine with this [sign].
<b>If I say to the lad…take [the arrows] and come.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">To signal Dovid’s acceptability by Shaul.</i></b> You should emerge from your hiding place, and take it, and come to me, for you have nothing to fear, for it is well with you.

<b>He must be impure.</b> And he has not yet immersed himself for his [discharge of] semen, for had he immersed himself for his [discharge of] semen, he would not have to wait for sunset [to eat] ordinary food.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Vayikra 22:4.</i>
<b>For he is not ritually pure.</b> This [clause] gives reason for the matter, because he is not pure, he, therefore, did not come, so that he would not contaminate the feast.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Either because they were accustomed to maintain the stringencies associated with ritual purity even for ordinary food; or perhaps the New Moon feast consisted of the consecrated food of the peace offerings.—Radak.</i>

Verse 30

<b>A straying woman, deserving of punishment.</b><span>נָע</span> is an expression of straying and wandering, a gadding woman.

<b>Deserving of punishment.</b> Who deserves to be chastised and disciplined.

<b>Dovid said.</b> To himself when his youths told him of Novol's insults, 'It was for naught that I guarded, etc.'

Verse 22

<b>Even one dog.</b> Targum Yonoson renders, 'one possessing intelligence,' one who sets the walls of his heart. Another explanation is, 'even a dog whose manner is to urinate against a wall.'<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Bava Basro 19b.</i>

Verse 24

<b>My master, with me lies the sin.</b> First she said this so that he would pay attention to her words.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">And thereby protect her household from Dovid and his men.</i> At the end, however, she told him the truth, that "I, your handmaid, did not see my master's youths."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Below, verse 25.</i>

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>[Adonoy] has prevented you.</b> Who sent me toward you to refrain you from committing bloodshed.
<b>And from avenging yourself by your own hand.</b> From personally avenging yourself and being punished.
<b>May all your enemies be like Novol.</b> She prophesied with the Divine Spirit<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Avigayil is mentioned among the seven prophetesses, in Maseches Megillah 14a.</i> that Novol will not live long.

Verse 27

<b>Let it be given to the youths.</b> And it will be given to the youths who are going, etc. <span>נִתְּנָה</span> [=it was given] is past tense, <span>וְנִתְּנָה</span> [=it will be given] is future tense.

Verse 28

<b>For Adonoy will surely make for my master an everlasting house.</b> To be king over Yisroel. Therefore, let no evil be found in you. It is therefore not fitting for you to do anything contrary to the law, to spread evil talk concerning your kingship.

Verse 29

<b>Slingshot.</b> A wide piece of leather, with an indentation in the middle of the sling, into which one places the stone.

Verse 30

<b>And may it be when Adonoy does good…</b> And you will reign.

Verse 31

<b>That this not be…an obstacle.</b> As a stumbling block, as in, 'and the stumbling [<span>לְפִיק</span>] of the knees';<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Nachum 2:11.</i> for had you done this, you would not be able to open your mouth to reprove anyone in future generations, concerning bloodshed.
<b>And that my master has avenged himself.</b> That you avenge yourself.

Verse 32



Verse 33

<b>Who prevented me.</b> You stopped me, as in, 'You shall not stop [<span>תִכְלָא</span>] your mercy,'<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 40:12.</i> [and] 'will not stop [<span>יׅכְלֶה</span>] you.'<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 23:6.</i>
<b>And from avenging myself with my own hand.</b> This is connected with [the phrase], 'from coming into bloodshed.' The '<span>מ</span>' [=from] of [<span>מִבּוֹא</span>] is connected to 'and avenging,' meaning, 'from coming into bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand.'

Verse 38

<b>After ten days.</b> There were seven days of mourning for Shmuel, so the Holy One, Blessed is He, suspended his sentence so that it should not coincide the mourning for this wicked man with his mourning period. Afterward, he became ill for three days and died, as it is stated, "And Adonoy inflicted Novol," and a Talmudist had stated that if one was ill three days and died, it is a death of a plague. However, our Rabbis stated that these are the Ten Days of Repentance which the Holy One, Blessed is He, waited for him to repent. But, some say that they correspond to the ten meals<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See above verses 5,9, and Maharsha in Rosh Hashanah 18a.</i> which Novol gave Dovid's servants, for Dovid had sent him ten youths, and he fed them.

He therefore swore that he will not kill Shaul.—See Midrash Tanchuma Beha’aloscha 10.</i> others say that he swore to Avishai, that if you kill this righteous man [Shaul], I shall mingle your blood with his blood.

<b>For they have driven me away.</b> From Eretz Yisroel.

Dovid compared Shaul’s fate to that of the partridge. Just as the partridge seeks the nests of other birds but the young return to their natural mother and the partridge is unable to keep them, so too, Shaul who chased after Dovid will be unable to keep his kingship.</i>

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>Days and four months.</b> The minimum [number] of days is two. It is impossible to explain this word, '<span>יָמִים</span>' as a year<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As we find <span>יָמִים</span> to mean ‘year’ in Bereishis 41:1.</i> because Dovid did not go to Achish until Shmuel had died, and Shaul only reigned after Shmuel's death<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore <span>יָמִים</span> is to be taken literally, i.e., days.</i> four months, as we learned in Seder Olam. Also [this can be deduced from the following:] the number of Eili's years [forty years which he judged Yisroel],<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Above 4:18.</i> and the twenty years that the Ark was in Kiryas Ye'arim<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Above 7:2.</i> total sixty years. Subtract from that Shmuel's fifty-two years, plus one year from his conception, with these four months, plus the seven years which Dovid reigned in Chevron<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 2:5.</i> before he brought the Ark from Kiryas Ye'arim. This [calculation] discloses that Shaul reigned after Shmuel's death but four months.

<b>Dovid…would go up.</b> This is the present tense, i.e., he was always accustomed doing this.
<b>In the direction of Shur.</b> From the entrance of Shur.

Verse 10

<b>Where did you raid.</b> The '<span>ל</span>' is interchangeable with a '<span>נ</span>' [so the word <span>אֶל</span>=<span>אָן</span> which means 'where'], as in "he prepared a large chamber [<span>נִשְׁכָּה</span>],"<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Nechemyoh 13:7.</i> in the Book of Ezra, meaning the equivalent of <span>לִשְׁכָּה</span> [=chamber].

Verse 3

<b>Shmuel had died.</b> It was already stated, "and Shmuel died,"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Above 25:1.</i> but since [Scripture] came to speak about Shaul, that he had to ask of a medium of <span>אוֹב</span>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 65b for description of <span>אוֹב</span>.</i>, it begins by stating, "and Shmuel had died," for had he been alive, Shaul would have inquired of him. But since Shaul had abolished the <span>אוֹב</span> mediums,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Pursuant to the prohibition stated in Vayikra 19:31. Shaul removed the mediums after Shmuel died. Before that, it was not necessary for him to do so because while Shmuel was alive, prophecy was widespread in Yisroel, so no one sought out the medium of <span>אוֹב</span> or <span>יׅדְּעֹנִי</span>.</i> he had to seek out find an <span>אוֹב</span> medium.
<b>And all of Yisroel mourned him and buried him in Romoh, in his city.</b> And all Yisroel mourned him and buried him in Romoh, and each person mourned him in his own city; and 'in his city' is connected with 'and they mourned him,' i.e., they mourned and buried him in Romoh, and each person mourned him in his own city.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In the same manner as he was mourned in his home town of Romoh.</i>

<b>What does he look like.</b> Three things were said regarding <span>אוֹב</span>: The one who conjures him [the dead] up, sees him, but does not hear his voice; the one who inquires of him, hears him, but does not see him, and therefore, he [Shaul] asked, 'What does he look like?', and the others neither see or hear him.
