Rashi on Judges



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b> Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites?</b> To the territories for which lots were cast<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">By Yehoshua, Elazar, and the tribal chieftains (Yehoshua, 14:1,2). Chapters 14–19 (there) list in detail the territories alloted to the various tribes when the lots were cast.</i> but are as yet unconquered.

Verse 2

<b> Let Yehudah go up.</b> Let the tribe of Yehudah go up first<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The tribesmen of Yehudah were first in many instances; they entered the water first at the splitting of the sea, their banner was the first to proceed when the Yisroelites journeyed in the wilderness, they went up first in the Book of Shoftim. Indeed, at the coming redemption, their tribesman Dovid will reign as the first of his countrymen. (Yalkut, 37:a. See Yalkut to Beshalach, 234)</i> to conquer their alloted territory.

Verse 3

<b> To his brother Shimon.</b> To the tribe of Shimon.
<b>Go up with me</b> and assist me in conquering my alloted portion. Some interpret "Let Yehudah go up" as a reference to Asniel,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Asniel ben Kenaz, the first of the Shoftim to lead Yisroel after the death of Yehoshua. (Below, 3:9–11)</i> also known as Ya'avetz;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ya’avetz is listed among the tribesmen of Yehudah, and described as “revered over his brethren.” (Divrei Hayamim 1, 4:9)</i> for it is remarked, in tractate Temurah,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"></i> "What was his name? His name was Yehudah, brother of Shimon."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This was his true name. His surnames were Asniel and Ya’avetz. Asniel is a contraction of ‘anah El’, ‘Adonoy answered’ [Divrei Hayamim 1, 4:10, relates that Adonoy answered his prayer]. Ya’avetz is a contraction of ‘ya’atz v’herebetz’, ‘he counseled and disseminated [Torah]’. (Temurah, 16:a)</i> He<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Not the tribe of Yehudah, but the individual Yehudah, otherwise known as Asniel or Ya’avetz.</i> told his brother Shimon<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The individual Shimon, brother of Yehudah / Asniel. Accordingly, the inquiry “Who shall go up first?” [v.1] did not concern the tribe which would engage in battle first, but the individual who would lead the people into battle. Adonoy answered [v.2] that Yehudah, also known as Asniel or Ya’avetz, would lead.</i> to accompany him.

Verse 4

<b> At Bezek.</b> The name of a place.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">‘Bezek’ may also be translated as ‘shard’, meaning a broken piece of pottery. Here, however, the reference is to a place named ‘Bezek’. (Yoma, 22:b)</i>

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b> Seventy kings.</b> From here we learn of the eminence and affluence of the Canaanite potentates, for Adoni-bezek was not worthy of being listed among the Canaanite monarchs<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua 12: 7–24 lists the thirty one Canaanite kings. Adoni bezek is not among them.</i> by the title "king", yet this is written of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Yalkut, 37:a.</i>
<b>They brought him to Yerushalayim.</b> They proceeded from there to do battle at Yerushalayim.

Verse 8

<b> They set [literally 'sent'] fire.</b> They sent the fire<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">By igniting it. This follows the literal meaning of <span>שׇלְחוּ</span>, ‘thy sent’. (Metzudas Tzion) Afterward, the B’nei Yehudah went down to wage war with the Canaanites dwelling in the hills, the Negev, and the lowlands.</i> throughout it.

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b> Coleiv's …brother.</b> Maternally.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Coleiv is referred to as “the Kenizite” (Yehoshua, 14:6), rather than ‘son of Kenaz’. This indicates that he was not Kenaz’ biological son, but his stepson. (Sotah, 11:b, 12:a).</i>

Verse 14

<b> She cajoled him.</b> She advised him, as in "he took counsel";<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than ‘she tempted him’, as in Devarim, 13:7.</i> one counsels a person, and directs his thinking to an alternative. This is my opinion.
<b>She lowered herself.</b> "She lowered herself"<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is a quotation from Targum Yonasan.</i> as if falling at her father's feet.

Verse 15

<b> Arid land.</b> A man barren of anything gainful, as he contains nothing but Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Temurah, 16:a.</i>
<b>Streams of water.</b> Wetland, "territory supplied abundantly with water."

Verse 16

<b> From the city of dates.</b> This refers to Yericho, as the fertile tract of Yericho<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">An area outside the city, measuring five hundred <i>amohs</i> by five hundred <i>amohs</i>. (Yalkut, 38.)</i> was given to them for their consumption until the Beis HaMikdosh would be built. The one in whose portion the Beis HaMikdosh would be built<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The tribe of Binyomin. (Ibid).</i> would then receive it,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In return for the Beis Hamikdosh territory, which would become the property of all the tribes.</i> so that all of Yisroel could share in the Beis HaMikdosh. It was given to the descendants of Yisro for four hundred and forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">From the conquest of Eretz Yisroel by Yehoshua, until the construction of the Beis Hamikdosh by King Solomon. (See Melachim 1,6:1.)</i> The scholars among them departed, and went to Asniel, the son of Kenaz, also known as Ya'avetz, to the wilderness of Yehudah south of Arad to study Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Yalkut, ibid.</i>
<b>He settled with the people.</b> With the disciples who sat before him. He requested of the Holy One, blessed is He, that He furnish him with suitable disciples, as it said, "Ya'avetz cried out to Elohim…etc."<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">“…of Yisroel, saying: If You bless me by broadening my boundary, and Your hand shall be with me…”. (Divrei Hayamim 1, 4:10. See fn.6)</i> He furnished him with these pious men.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Yalkut, ibid.</i>

Verse 17



Verse 18



Verse 19

<b> However, he could not oust.</b> [Targum] Yonasan interprets: Afterward, as they had sinned, they could not oust the valley dwellers.

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b> But the Yevusi dwellers of Yerushalayim.</b> There was a section of Yerushalayim<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The reference here is not to members of the Yevusite nation, as Rashi explains that they were descendants of the Pelishte king Avimelech. Cf.Rashi to Yehoshua, 16:63, and Shmuel 2, 5:6.</i> entitled Yevusi. They were descendants of Avimelech,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Pelishite king (Bereishis, 21:32, 26:8). The patriarch Avrohom swore that he would deal kindly with him and his children and grandchildren. (Ibd, 21:23). Avrohom’s descendants were obligated by the oath as well. Cf.Midrash Rabah, Bereishis, 54:2.</i> and they could not oust them because of the oath—until the arrival of Dovid<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">When Avimelech’s grandchildren no longer survived. (Rashi to Shmueil 2, 5:8)</i>—as his<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Avimelech’s grandson.</i> grandson still lived, and he<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Avrohom had sworn.</i> had sworn to him, his son, and his grandson.

Verse 22

<b> Beis El</b> which was part of their ancestral allotment. Although Michah's idol<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 17, v.4 [below] relates that Michah of Mount Ephraim made a graven image and kept it at his home, where it was worshiped. Although the incident is not mentioned earlier in the text, Rashi asserts that the idol was already in existence during the conquest of Eretz Yisroel. See Rasi to 17:1.</i> was in their possession—for Michah was from the tribe of Ephraim—it is said here, "and Adonoy was with them." Concerning this, Daniel said, "Yours, O Adonoy, is benevolence—ours is the face of humiliation."<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel, 9:7.</i>

Verse 23

<b> Sent spies.</b> Through others, they sent spies.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is Targum Yonasan’s translation.</i> "They spied the land"<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"> Bamidbar, 13:21. This refers to the spies sent by Moshe in the wilderness.</i> is said concerning the spies themselves. However, concerning these who sent spies it is said, "they sent spies."

Verse 24

<b> The entrance to the city.</b> It was entered through a cave. A hazelnut tree stood at the mouth of the cave, and they passed through the tree<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The tree was hollow. They passed through the hollow section into the cave, then through the cave into the city. (Bereishis Rabah, 69:8)</i> into the cave.

Verse 25

<b> He showed them</b> with his finger.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">If this heathen, by the mere flick of a finger, saved himself and his progeny, then certainly one who actively escorts others. (Sotah, 46:b)</i>

Verse 26

<b>Luz.</b> Small nuts grow on this. "Coudre" in old French.
<b> It is so entitled to this day.</b> Sancheriv did not "jumble" it,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Sancheriv “jumbled” all the nations of the world by transporting the inhabitants of one country to another. (Yadayim, 4:3, Yeshaya, 10:13). He did the same to the inhabitants of Eretz Yisroel (Melachim 2, 17:6, 23, 24) but not to the inhabitants of Luz.</i> and Nevuchadnetzar did not devastate it.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah, 46:b.</i>

Verse 27

<b> Menashe did not oust.</b> Scripture censures them, as they began betraying the Holy One, blessed is He, Who commanded them: "Oust all those dwelling in the land, etc."<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Bemidbar, 33:52.</i>

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b> Adonoy's emissary went up.</b> We learn in Seder Olam that this was Pinchos.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Son of Elazar, grandson of Aharon Hakohen. (Bemidbar, 25:11.)</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> Why is Pinchas entitled <span>מַלְאַךְ ה׳</span>, lit. “an angel of Adonoy”? Because, when visited by the sacred spirit, he was enflamed with radiance. (Vayikra Rabah, A. See Rashi to Yehoshua, 2:4).</i>
<b>To Bochim.</b> The name of a place.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Not literally “weeping”. See vs.4,5.</i>
<b>I took you up.</b> This was My original intent,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The future tense, <span>אַעֲלֶה</span>, literally “I shall take”, indicates the intent which preceded the actual taking. See Rashi to Shemos, 15:1.</i> to take you up from Mitzrayim—and I did so—with the stipulation that My enemies be ousted.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> As indicated by the warning against covenants [v.2].</i>

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b> Now I have also declared.</b> At present I have declared, in My fury.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is not part of the original intent stated in vs.1,2, but is a new declaration, made now because they sinned.</i>
<b>At your flanks.</b> They will harass your flanks with bandits and troops, pillaging and plundering.

Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6

<b> Yehoshua dismissed, etc.</b> This incident had taken place previously, but, as Scripture intends to relate that they acted wickedly [v.11], it begins with the following statement: at Yehoshua's death, when they resolved, in his presence, to serve Adonoy, he dismissed them, each man to his ancestral property. They served Adonoy throughout his days and the days of the elders. Afterward, "The Bnei Yisroel acted wickedly."

Verse 7

<b> Whose days extended.</b> Their 'days' extended<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In contentment. However, their lives were short. (Shabbos, 105:b.-See Rashi there).</i> but not their 'years', as they neglected to eulogize him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture omits any mention of a mourning period for Yehoshua, as with Aharon (Bemidbar 20:29) and Moshe (Devarim 34:8). This indicates that they were remiss in eulogizing him and mourning for him. (Tosafos to Shabbos, 105:b).</i> Thus it is said, "…of Mount Ga'ash"—<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">“They buried him (Yehoshua)…at Mount Ephraim, north of Ga’ash.” [v.9] Mount Ephraim was better known than G’ash. Why, then, does Scripture identify the famous Mountain by its proximity to the obscure Ga’ash? Evidently, “Ga’ash” is not an identifying landmark, but is intended as a homiletical allusion to “ra’ash”, “storm”, teaching that the mountain stormed against them. (Maharsha to Shabbos, ibid.).</i> the mountain stormed at them<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbos, ibid.</i> to slaughter them.

Verse 8



Verse 9

<b> At Timnas Cheres.</b> So entitled because a likeness of the sun<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">‘Timnas Serach’ is literally translated as ‘The likeness of the sun’.</i> was placed over his grave, as if to say, "Alas, that a man who halted the sun<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua ordered the sun to stand still, and the sun obeyed. (Yehoshua, 10:12,13.)</i> lies in the grave."

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14



Verse 15

<b> Wherever they went, the hand of Adonoy was destructive to them.</b> This refers to Elimelech, Machlon, and Chilyon—<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Naomi’s husband and two sons, mentioned in the opening passages of the Book of Rus. They were punished with poverty and then death. See Rashi to Megilas Rus, ch.1.</i> Seder Olam.

Verse 16

<b> Adonoy established judges.</b> Continuously, in successive generations, as enumerated in this book, judge succeeding judge.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b> When He would establish</b>—This describes an ongoing process—'When He would establish judges for them, and Adonoy would visit with the judge, etc.'
<b>For He would recant.</b> He would recant, concerning them, from the destruction.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Which He had intended to rain upon them. Accordingly, <span>יְנַחֵם</span> is not understood as ‘would find comfort,’ but as ‘would recant.’ See Rashi to Bereishis, 6:6, second interpretation.</i> This is Yonasan's rendition.
<b>From the outcry</b>—As a result of their cry that went up to Him because of their tormentors

Verse 19

<b> They fell nothing short.</b> They omitted nothing deserving of the reproach inherent in everything that befell them.

Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b> Whether they observe.</b> The letter <span>ה</span> is vocalized with the abridged <i>pasach</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This vocalization is used to express inquiry.</i> as it expresses the inquiry involved in testing.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b> So that Yisroel would be tested through them.</b> This was a different generation, ignorant of the miracles of the Canaanite wars, and not having witnessed the great deeds, they rebelled, and betrayed the Omnipresent.

Verse 2

<b> Only so that they should know.</b> For this alone, He permitted these nations to remain, so that future generations of the Bnei Yisroel might grasp the consequence of iniquity—for it was now necessary for them to undergo martial training.
<b>Whereas earlier</b> when they stood worshiping Adonoy.
<b>This was unknown.</b> These wars and the art of battle. It was unnecessary.

Verse 3

<b> Five Pelishtite sovereignties.</b> These were the nations whom He permited to remain as a test.

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b> The Divine spirit visited him.</b> R' Tanchuma expounded: He studied the statement of the Holy One, blessed is He, to Moshe in Mitzrayim, "I have surely seen (lit. 'seeing, I have seen') the tribulation of my people."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Shemos, 3:7.</i> What are the two sights?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">‘Seeing’ I have ‘seen’.</i> He said to him, "I see that they are destined to err with the golden calf—nevertheless, 'I have seen the tribulation of my people.'" Asniel expounded upon this, saying, whether innocent or guilty, He is obliged to save them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos Rabah, 3:2. Accordingly, “He judged Yisroel” in our passage does not refer to Asniel’s adjudication of litigation in the courtroom, but to his exposition of “I have seen” in his prayer before Adonoy. In his “judgement”, Yisroel was to be saved. (Radal there, 5)</i>

Verse 11



Verse 12



Verse 13

<b> The city of dates.</b> Yericho.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b> Whose right arm was immobile.</b> Yonasan renders "A man whose right arm was shrunken." "Gamid" in the Aramaic always indicates something shrunken by disease, "retrait", "shrunk" in old French. He could not utilize his right arm. In Hebrew, "closed", as in "Let not the well close its mouth over me."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim, 69:16.</i> His right arm was "closed"—he could not utilize it.

Verse 16

<b> One <i>gomed</i> long.</b> An abridged amoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The length of the forearm. (Rashbam to Bava Basra, 100:a).</i> In German, 'daumen lang'. In old French, 'espan courte'.
<b>Over his right thigh.</b> Since he was able to utilize his left hand, he would grasp it with the left hand.

Verse 17

<b> Obese.</b> Fat.

Verse 18

<b> He escorted the people.</b> He turned back to accompany the delegation of Yisroelites who came with him to bear the gift. He escorted them until Gilgal.

Verse 19

<b>He then returned</b> alone.
<b>From the quarries.</b> An area where stones were excavated from the mountain. Similarly, Yonasan renders "from the quarries." Then he went to Eglon,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ehud’s return to Eglon is not actually discussed in the text. Rashi mentions the return for the sake of clarification.</i> and declared to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“…I have a matter, etc.”.</i>
<b>He said, "Hsst."</b> Eglon said, "Silence everyone near me!" Yonasan renders, "Leave!"—remove everyone. Still, the term connotes silence.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Silence them by removing them.</i>

Verse 20

<b> In his penthouse veranda.</b> In the summer penthouse which was airy and cool.
<b>I have a Divine message for you!</b> Thus, you are required to rise.
<b>He rose from the throne.</b> He therefore merited that Rus was descended from him.

Verse 21



Verse 22

<b> The hilt.</b> The iron into which the blade is inserted, called 'hulot' in old French. This balances the sword in its scabbard.
<b>The blade.</b> The sharpened section, called "brant" and "lama" in old French.
<b>The fat closed.</b> His fat. He was extremely corpulent, so that he enclosed the entire length of the dagger.
<b>Waste matter oozed.</b> Yonasan renders, "Spilled waste matter oozed." He reads this as a contraction of two words with the 'shin' serving both.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> <span>פַּרְשְׁדֹֽנׇה</span> is read as <span>פֶּרֶשׁ־שְׁדוֹנׇא</span>, “spilled waste matter”, with the middle <span>ש</span> serving as the last letter of <span>פֶּרֶשׁ</span> and the first letter of <span>שְׁדוֹנׇא</span>.</i> "spilled waste matter" [oozed].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The waste matter first spilled from the abdomen into the body, then it oozed from the wound. (Ralbag).</i><span>שְׁפַךְ</span>, "spilled", is the translation of <span>שְׁדָא</span><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Or <span>שְׁדוֹנׇא</span>.</i> according to Yonasan.

Verse 23

<b> And Ehud went out to the hallway.</b> From the penthouse to the <span>מסדרונה</span>, translated by Targum Yonasan as 'hallway'.
<b>And locked</b> With the key.

Verse 24

<b> As he left.</b> Ehud left, and Eglon's servants came.
<b>Relieving himself [lit. 'covering his legs'].</b> Performing his necessary bodily functions. This refers to a bowel movement.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">When the legs are covered as a matter of modesty. (Metzudas).</i>

Verse 25

<b> A considerable time.</b> [lit.] Until [it constituted] delay, as if to say, a considerable time.

Verse 26

<b> Escaped.</b> Fled, "eschamocier" in old French.
<b>While [lit. until] they tarried.</b> As in,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi cites these quotations to demonstrate that <span>עַד</span>, lit. “until”, may be translated as while”.</i> "While the king lounged,"<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Shir Hashirim, 1:12.</i> "Affection, while still desired"<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid, 2:7.</i>—while we both desire it.
<b>In the underbrush.</b> A thin-branched, heavily wooded forest, called "brousaille", brush, in old French, excellent for concealment. Frequently, in the order of Zeraim, thin branches are called "sa'ar"—"[He] overturned the branches,"<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Kilayim, 4:9.</i> "If the branches meshed."<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Peah, 2:3.</i>

Verse 27

<b> It happened that, when he arrived.</b> He crossed the Yardein, and arrived at his place in the land of Canaan.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The text omits Ehud’s crossing of the Yardein and his arrival in Canaan. Rashi mentions these events for clarification.</i>
<b>At Mount Ephrayim.</b> Which was in the land of Canaan, on the western side of the Yardein. The land of Moav was on the eastern side of the Yardein, but as they had subdued Yisroel and crossed the Yardein, they occupied Yericho as stated above, and installed their princes and governors over Yisroel.

Verse 28

<b> Charge behind me</b> to wipe out all the Moabites on our side of the Yardein.
<b>Took control of the Yardein passes</b> so that the Moabites could not cross to escape and return to their country.

Verse 29

<b> All horrific [lit. corpulent].</b> Every man awe inspiring.

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b> With a goad.</b> A saddle spur, "aiguillon" in old French.

Chapter 4



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b> Charoshes Hogoyim.</b> The name of a city, so entitled because it was a stronghold, and the seat of authority.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on Targum Yonasan, who translates <span>חֲרֹשֶׁת הַגּוֹיׅם</span> as “the stronghold, metropolis of nations”.</i>

Verse 3

<b> Oppressed the Bnei Yisroel intensely.</b> R' Tanchuma expounded, through ridicule. Similarly, it is said, "Your remarks offend me intensely."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi, 3:13. Vs. 14, 15 there define the offensive remarks as ridicule of the worship of Adonoy.</i>

Verse 4

<b> The wife of Lapidos.</b> She fashioned wicks for the sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Megilah, 14:a. <span>לַפּׅיד</span> is translated as “torch”.</i>

Verse 5

<b> Under [Devorah's] date tree.</b> She owned date trees in Yericho.
<b>Between Ramah and Beis El, on Mount Ephrayim.</b> From Yonasan's translation<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Targum Yonasan renders, “She lived in the city of Ataros. Devorah was financially independent. She owned date trees in Yericho, orchards in Ramah, oil producing olive trees in the wetlands of the Beis Eil plateau, white soil in Tur Malka.”</i> we infer that this passage is not meant literally—that these are not intended to identify her dwelling place. Rather, we learn that she was an affluent woman, with financial interests in these places. She lived in a city named Ataros.
<b>Under [Devorah's] date tree.</b> She owned date trees in Yericho, vineyards in Rama, olive trees in the Bethel plateau, a fertile area, and white soil in Mount Ephrayim, at Tur Malka. In my opinion, this was sold for ceramic use. Some interpret "white soil" as grain fields, as in "the grain [lit. "white"] field."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud [Moed Katan, 6:b, etc.] refers to the grain field as <span>שֽׂדֵה לׇכׇן</span>, literally “white field.” Rashi [Pe’ah, 3:1] explains that this is because grain whitens when ripe for harvesting. Or, to distinguish between the grain field, which is subject to the sun’s white glare, and the orchard, which is darkened by the shade of the trees.</i>

Verse 6

<b> Has not….commanded?</b> Through Moshe, "For you shall totally annihilate them."<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim, 20:17</i> Mechilta teaches this.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yalkut, 4:43.</i>

Verse 10

<b> At his heels.</b> With him.

Verse 11

<b> Elon Betza'anayim.</b> The marshland plain.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is Targum Yonasan’s rendition.</i> A plateau area with marshes, "mariscum", "morass" in old French. This is called <span>אַגָנַיָא</span>—pools, similar to ditches where water settles, "entitled 'the earth's flasks.'"<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin, 61:a, notes that water filed ditches are entitled <span>אַגׇּנֵי דּֽאַרְעָא</span>, “the earth’s flasks.” Thus, <span>אַגָנַיׇא</span>, “flasks,” refer to the marshland pools.</i>

Verse 18

<b> With a cloak.</b> Yonasan renders <span>גוֹנְכׇא</span>. R' Hai translates <span>גוֹנְכׇא</span> as cloak, "Coate" in old French.

Verse 19

<b> The milk pouch.</b> Since milk induces drowsiness, then slumber.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He requested water. Why did she give him milk? To make him drowsy.</i>

Verse 20

<b> Stand at the entrance to the tent.</b> Be zealous about it. Some interpret <span>עֲמֹד</span> [lit. "stand"] as <span>לַעֲמוֹד</span>, "to stand".<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation adds the <span>ל</span>, which does not actually appear in the text, so that the reading is “He told her to stand at the entrance.” According to the literal textual interpretation, the reading is, “He told her, stand at the entrance.” This is problematic, as the masculine <span>עֲמוֹד</span>, rather than <span>עִמֽדִי</span>, is inappropriate in addressing a woman. The additional <span>ל</span> solves this difficulty by transforming the command, <span>עֲמוֹד</span>, “stand”, into the infinitive <span>לַעֲמוֹד</span>, “to stand.”</i>

Verse 21

<b> A tent peg.</b> "Chevilles" in old French. This is embedded in the ground with the lower flap of the tent in order to extend it fully.
<b>A hammer.</b> Hammer, "martel" in old French.
<b>Furtively.</b> Stealthily, in secret.
<b>And impaled it into the ground.</b><span>וּנְעַצַתְּ בְּאַרְעָא</span>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is Targum Yonasan’s rendition.</i> and impaled it into the ground.

Verse 22

Verse 1



Verse 2

<b> When Yisroel was inundated with breaches.</b> When breaches befell Yisroel; when their enemies invaded them because they deserted Adonoy, and yet the people volunteered to repent—at this point, bless Adonoy for bringing deliverance.

Verse 3

<b> I…I.</b> The word is doubled. I have heard in the name of Midrash Agaddah: the Holy One blessed is He did not deny a reward for [Mount] Tovor and [Mount] Carmel, who came to the giving of Torah so that it might be given on them, and turned away in humiliation. The Holy One, blessed is He told them, "Eventually, I shall reward you doubly. At Sinai it is said, 'I am the Lord your God;'<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos, 20:2.</i> at Tovor it shall be said, 'I…I.'<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word “I” is doubled.</i> At Sinai it is said, 'I am the Lord your God;' At Carmel it shall be said doubly, 'Adonoy is God,' 'Adonoy is God!'<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Melachim 1, 18:39.</i> in Eliyahu's days."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Yalkut, 47.</i>

Verse 4

<b> Adonoy, when You went forth from Seir,</b> This refers to the giving of Torah, as it is said, "…and shone forth from Seir to them."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim, 33:2. Adonoy first offered the Torah to Eisov’s descendants at Seir. When they refused, He shone forth from there to Yisroel at Sinai. (Rashi to Devarim, there).</i> Why is this relevant here? This is what Devorah said: "The Torah is severe when forsaken, but rewarding when adhered to, as it was given in awesomeness and power.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As indicated by the quaking of the earth and the dripping of heaven in v.4, and the dissolving of the mountain in v.5.</i> Thus, the Yisroelites were handed over to their enemies for forsaking it; and, when they offered to engross themselves in it, they were saved." All this we learn from Targum Yonasan's rendition.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“Adonoy, the Torah which you have given to Yisroel: When they violate it, their enemies dominate them, and when they return to it, they are empowered over their antagonists”.

<b>Dripped.</b> They dripped dew of revival.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As the Yisroelites glowed with a heavenly fire, Adonoy instructed the clouds of glory to drip dew of revival to restore them. (Yalkut, 48)</i>

Verse 5

<b> Mountains streamed.</b> Like streaming water—they dissolved.
<b>This Sinai….</b> Scripture has already recounted the visions there—covered by mist, thunder, flashes of light, flame.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos, 19:18, 20:15, etc. Our passage, therefore, omits this, leaving it to the reader’s understanding. See the following Rashi.</i>
<b>Because of the presence of Adonoy</b> This is an shortened passage: "This Sinai—what took place there occured because the mountain was visited by Adonoy."

Verse 6

<b> In the days of Shamgar ben Anas, in the days of Yael.</b> This teaches that Yael, too, judged Yisroel in her days.
<b>Thoroughfares came to a halt.</b> The Yisroelites were afraid to undertake normal travel, because of their enemies. They would proceed along round about pathways, clandestinely.

Verse 7

<b> Exposure was discontinued.</b> Exposed, unwalled cities were discontinued as dwelling places, because of the enemies, and they flocked to the fortified cities.
<b>Until I rose.</b> This<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture substitutes the <i>“pasach”</i> vowelization for the <i>“segol”</i> in the opening ‘<span>ש</span>’ of <span>שקמתי</span>. The <i>“kametz”</i> vowelization of the opening ‘<span>ש</span>’ is substituted for the <i>“segol”.</i></i> is the same as <span>שֶׁקַמְתִּי</span> Similarly, 'That you are speaking to me'

Verse 8

<b> When they chose new gods—there was war in the cities.</b> When the Yisroelites preferred modern Deities, then they needed to engage in battle in their cities. But, take note, now, when they volunteered, was a shield or battle ax in sight among the Yisroelites when they needed to do battle with the forty thousand field marshals the idolators flung against them? The Omnipresent overwhelmed them all with celestial warfare, and the Kishon stream swept them away.
<b>Cities.</b> As in, "If there should be found in your midst, in one of your cities".<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim, 17:2. Although generally translated as “gates”, <span>שְׁעָרִים</span> is translated here as “cities”.</i>

Verse 9

<b> My heart.</b> I, Devorah, [my heart is out] to the legislators of Yisroel—with affection for the sages of Yisroel who volunteered, among the people, saying, "Bless Adonoy, return to Him".

Verse 10

<b> Riders of white donkeys.</b> Merchants and gentry who may now ride elegant, white donkeys without intimidation or concern about their enemies. And jurists—this refers to the magistrates who were afraid to deliver judgement publicly, as Targum Yonasan's translates, "Those who assembled to sit in judgement". And wayfarers on foot. Speak up! Recount this salvation, when, in place of the clamor of the formations battling you—marauders, thieves, tax processors, who station themselves in battle formations organized to waylay those crossing to watering places—there, the donkey riders and wayfarers will retell Adonoy's charity. What is this charity? The charity of His restoration of exposure in Yisroel, when He brought tranquility to Yisroel, allowing them to dwell in exposed cities, and to venture forth when dipersed,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud (Pesachim, 87:b) reads <span>פּֽרָזוֹן</span>, lit. “exposure”, as <span>פִּזְרוֹן</span>, “dispersion”. Rashi follows this interpretation.</i> singly, without grouping together. Then, they went down to the cities, returning to the cities they had inhabited when they fled to congregate in the fortified cities.

Verse 11

<b> Battle formations.</b> Menachem interprets "strategists, military tactitians."<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning “the battle formations organized by strategists and tactitians.”</i> He relates this to "The locust has no king, yet he advances entirely 'in formation'."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei, 30:27.</i> The meaning is 'battle formations." Another interpretation,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Both interpretations appear in Targum Yonasan.</i>
<b>Concerning the clatter of pebbles amidst the watering places.</b> When you would walk amidst the watering places to draw water, you were terrified by the clatter of the pebbles smoothed by the stream, "cailloux" in old French. When stepped on, they emit a noise, and you were afraid that your presence would be sensed by your enemies. Now, however, such fears are baseless, and this is why you are commanded to offer thanks to His Name.
<b>Pebbles.</b> This refers to pebbles smoothed by a stream, as in "He ground with pebbles."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Eichah, 3:16.</i>

Verse 12

<b> Awaken, awaken.</b> The inference is, "awaken to praise," as plainly indicated. "Intensify your singing." However, the Rabbis remark,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Pesachim, 66:b.</i> because she was self lauditory and said, "Until I rose, Devorah,"<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Thereby favoring herself over the leaders who preceded her.

Verse 13

<b> Dominated.</b><span>יְרַד</span> is similar to <span>יִרְדֶה</span>, "dominated,"<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><span>יָרַד</span> is translated as descended. <span>יְרַד</span>, however, means dominated.</i> as in "to prostrate nations before him."<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">To give him dominion over them.

<b>Adonoy empowered me over the mighty.</b> Gave me dominion<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See fn.19.</i> over the mighty warriors among the nations.

Verse 14

<b> In Ephraim.</b> From Ephraim emerged the root of Yehoshua bin Nun's dominance over Amaleik<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> Yehoshua was descended from Ephraim, son of Yoseif, and Amaleik was a descendant of Eisov. Scripture states, “The house of Yaakov shall be fire, the house of Yoseif flame, the house of Eisov chaff” [Ovadiah, 18], teaching that the descendants of Yoseif shall devour the descendants of Eisov as flame consumes chaff.

Verse 15

<b> Yesochar's nobles.</b> The noblemen of Yesochar. This refers to members of the Sanhedrin who were engrossed in Torah study, and who knew and understood the times.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Divrei Hayamim (1, 12:32) lists, among King Davids followers, “Of the sons of Yesachar, who knew and understood the times.” They understood the nature of the events taking place in their times, and were, therefore, qualified to serve as King David’s advisors. (Rashi to Divrei Hayamim, there). Or, they were expertly versed in the calculations used in fixing the months and years of the Jewish calendar. They knew and understood the determination of the times of the calendar. (Yalkut, here, 52. See Rashi to Bereishis, 49:15)</i> They constantly accompanied Devorah, teaching the Yisroelites the laws and precepts.
<b>Yesochar's nobles.</b> The "<span>י</span>" in <span>שׇׂרַי</span> [lit. "my" nobles] is ancillary, fulfilling no grammatic function. It is similar to the "<span>י</span>" in "the animals in the field,"<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim, 8:8. <span>שׇׂדַי</span>, lit. “my” field, is translated as <span>שׇׂדֶה</span>, “the field.”</i> or "he cut open, for himself, a window."<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Yermiyahu, 22:14. <span>חַלּוֹנַי</span>, lit. “my windows,” is translated as <span>חַלּוֹן</span>, “the window.”</i>

Verse 16

<b> The shrieking companies.</b> Listening to the sounds emitted by the companies engaged in battle, to determine which was the cry of triumph, and which the cry of defeat.

Verse 17

<b> Is ensconced beyond the Yardein</b> and never arrived at the battle front. Similarly, Dan hoarded his money into sea vessels, poised to escape.
<b>At his exposures.</b> To defend his exposed territory.

Verse 18

<b> Zevulun; a people who disdained, etc.</b> They were contemptuous of their lives, and subjected themselves to death in battle with Barak. Likewise, Naftoli at the highland field on Mount Tovor.

Verse 19

<b> At Ta'anach to the waters of Megiddo.</b> Targum Yonasan renders, "They were encamped at Ta'anach, and reached the waters of Megiddo." The upper section of the camp was at Ta'anach, and it extended to the waters of Megiddo.
<b>Deigning no mercenary reward.</b> They came to Sisera's assistance gratuitously—without requesting payment.

Verse 20

<b> War was waged from heaven.</b> The Holy One blessed is He, as well, dispatched His hosts against them. They, too, have no desire for any payment.
<b>In their pathways.</b> The upper tip of the star was in heaven, the bottom on earth. This teaches that the width of the firmament is equivalent to the distance between heaven and earth. For the star is suspended across the firmament like a sort of bolt across a door, its length measuring the same as the width of the firmament. From this passage, which attests that they waged war in their pathways, we learn that the width of the firmament is the same as the elevation of heaven from earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">“In their pathways” indicates that the star remained in its celestial path during the battle on earth. Evidently, the tip of the star remained fixed in heaven, while the remainder swung downward so that the lower edge reached the earth and destroyed Sisera’s forces. Since the star now extended from heaven to earth normally reached across the firmament, we learn that the distance between the two areas is the same.</i>

<b>My soul trampled underfoot</b> the power of the mighty Canaanite warriors.

Verse 22

<b> Horses' legs were battered.</b> Their horses' hooves were severed. The heat of the star brought the mud to a boil, severing the hooves, as when legs are scalded in boiling water to detach the hooves. Once the hooves were severed, the legs were battered.
<b>By the prancing, the prancing of their mighty.</b> They pranced their horses in battle, as in "a prancing horse.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Nachum, 3:2.</i> The word connotes the dancing of a horse.

Similarly, "The mighty of Bashan encircled me,"<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim, 22:13.</i> and, "For the villain encircles the saint."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Chabakuk, 1:4.</i> Also, the word "wreath" connotes encirclement, as in, "Shaul and his troops encircled [lit. wreathed] David and his troops in order to seize them"<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel 1, 23:26.</i>
<b>Called for their pursuit.</b> They called for pursuit behind them—they shouted to each other to pursue.
<b>And intercepted them at rest.</b> At the cities, where they generally rested, they intercepted them.
<b>Intercepted them.</b> Caught them. There is a similar term in the Talmud, "He pursued him a parsa in the sand, but did not catch him."<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Kesubos, 60:b.</i>
<b>Up to the area facing Givoh.</b> East of Givoh.

Verse 44

<b> There fell, from Binyomin,</b> eighteen thousand troops In the field, in the thick of battle.

Verse 45

<b> They gleaned them.</b> Killing constantly, like plucking gleanings after reaping.
<b>Five thousand troops.</b> Thus totaling twenty three thousand.
<b>Until Gid'om.</b> The name of a place.
<b>Striking down, of them, two thousand troops.</b> Thus totaling twenty-five thousand mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">V.35.</i> The remaining one hundred recorded above<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> fell at unnamed locations.

Verse 46



Verse 47



Verse 48

<b> Turned to the sons of Binyomin</b> in all the cities.
<b>Completely annihilating the cities.</b> They annihilated all the inhabitants of the cities,
<b>Including the cattle—</b>the people are included in "completely annihilating," since <span><b>מְּתֹם</b></span> denotes absolute annihilation. There is a problem with the location of one thousand, as twenty-six thousand were counted in the cities, and seven hundred at Givoh;<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">V.15.</i> here, those who fell totaled twenty-five thousand, one hundred troops,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">V. 46.</i> and six hundred escaped to Rimon cliff.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">V. 47. This totals 25,700, whereas the total in v. 15 was 26,700.</i> Evidently, one thousand fled to the cities, and fell the following day when the Bnei Yisroel turned to the cities of Binyomin to annihilate the women and children.

Verse 22

<b> To fight us</b> To go to war against us.
<b>We shall tell them we were merciful with them.</b> We were merciful with them because they did not know what to do, as we could not provide each of these men with a wife at the time of the war with Yoveish Gilod, except for four hundred of them. And if it is your oath that disturbs you, there is nothing sinful here on your part, since you were not the ones who provided them with your daughters, so that you would now be blameworthy. Peaceful salutations, have no fear!
