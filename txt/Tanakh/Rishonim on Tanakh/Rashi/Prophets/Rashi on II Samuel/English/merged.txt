Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Behold a man came from the camp.</b> The Pesikta<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Pesikta Rabosi 12,9.</i> brings an opinion that this man is Doeig,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Doeig HaEdomi is first mentioned in Shmuel 1,21:8.</i> but the explanation is indefensible in my heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from Shmuel 1, 22:18 that Shaul knew Doeig. Therefore, if in fact this man is Doeig, why did Shaul have to ask later in v. 8, “Who are you?” (Seder Hadoros, p. 102).</i>

<b>I am gripped with convulsions.</b> I am gripped with convulsions.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is Targum Yonasan’s translation.</i> The Midrash Aggadah<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Tanchuma Metzoro 2.</i> explains that this<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Shaul’s death in this manner was retribution for that sin.</i> occurred because of Shaul's sin of killing the Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Of the city of Nov, see Shmuel 1,22:18.</i> as it is written concerning them,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Kohanim in general.</i> "a checkered shirt."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Shemot, 28:4 lists the <span>כתנת תשבץ</span> as one of the garments worn by the Kohanim. Both the word <span>תַּשְׁבֵּץ</span> there and the word <span>הַשָּׁבָץ</span> here share the same three letters, <span>ש־ב־ץ</span>.</i>
<b>While I am still alive.</b> Hurry and kill me. I prefer that you kill me and not they<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Pelishtim.</i> kill and torture me.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Prior to my death.</i>

Verse 10

<b>And the bracelet that was on his arm.</b> The tefilin that was on his arm.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is Targum Yonasan’s translation. He refuses to explain it to literally mean bracelet because that would have been taken by the Pelishtim as part of the spoils of war (Meam Loez).</i>

Verse 16

<b>Your blood is on your own head.</b> The responsibility for your death rests on your own head.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is Targum Yonasan’s translation.</i> There is no one to punish for your death but yourself.

Verse 17



Verse 18

<b>He said, "To teach the Bnei Yehudah archery.</b> David said, "Now that mighty among Yisroel have fallen, the Bnei Yehudah need to be taught how to make war and how to pull back a bow.
<b>Behold it is written in the Seifer HaYoshor.</b> This is written in Seifer Bereishis, which is the Seifer of the righteous,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi is citing the opinion of Rav Yochonon in Avodah Zarah, 25a.</i> Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov. And where [In Bereishis] is it hinted at? "Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies."<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 49:8.</i> What type of warfare is it where he places his hand next to his forehead,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">When pulling back the string of his bow. Rashi in Avodah Zarah, ibid writes the archer places his hand next to his eyes. This is how they sight their targets.</i> which is opposite his neck?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation reads the verse in Bereishis differently: “your hand will be on your neck.” See Marsho, Avodah Zarah ibid.</i> One must say: this is archery.

Verse 19

<b>Pillar of Yisroel, on your heights [you have been rendered] a corpse.</b> Pillars of Yisroel, on the mightiest point of your stronghold you have fallen as corpses. This is Yonasan's translation.

Verse 20



Verse 21

<b>Mountains in Gilboa.</b> The mountains in Gilboa.
<b>Nor fields [yielding enough for] baking offerings.</b> There will be no harvest among [the fields] that have the amount [that necessitates] making the baking offering.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">If one prepares the amount of omer’s worth of dough then one must take off a portion of the mixture and give it to a kohein, see Shelach 15,20. An omer is the equivalent of forty-three and one-fifth eggs by volume.</i>
<b>Because there, the shield of soldiers spit out.</b> They had shields made of skins and when they went to war, they smeared them with oil so that a weapon hitting [the shield] should slip [off of it]. As it is said [in Scriptures] "Get up officers, smear [your] shield with oil. And here this is what the Lamentation means, "There, the shield of soldiers spit out," it spit out its oil and [the oil] did not stick to it and rendered [the shield] as if it wasn't smeared with oil. All [uses of the word] <span>הַגְעָלָה</span> is a language of rejecting what had been put into it as [we find] "His oxen will impregnate, [the seed] will not be rejected."

Verse 22

<b>Would not be pulled back.</b> Was not used to being pulled back.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Without hitting Yohanasan’s targets, thereby spilling his enemies’ blood and cutting through their fat.</i>

Verse 23

<b>They were lighter then eagles.</b> To do the will of their Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi is paraphrasing Pirkei Avos 5,23.</i>

Verse 8

<b>Took Ish Boshes.</b> He extrapolated from a verse that two kings were destined to come from Binyomin. Because the Holy One, blessed is He told Yakov, "Kings will come forth from you," and [by this time] all of his children had been born except for Binyomin.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Will come forth from you” implies that they were to come from someone yet unborn, and this could only be Binyomin. Avner understood this to mean that two kings will be descendant from Binyomin, Shaul and Ish Boshes (Rashi and Sifsei Chachomin, Breshis 35,11).</i>

Another [way] to interpret it is as it's plain meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation of <span>לולא</span> is the usual “if not for.”</i>: if you had not spoken i.e. that which you said "Let the young soldiers get up and playfight."<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Those words triggered this deadly battle.</i>

Verse 28



Verse 29

<b>The Bisron.</b> The name of a region.

Verse 30

<b>Nineteen men and Asoel.</b> But is not Asoel included in [the group called] "the servants of Dovid," so why is he [singled] out? [The reason is] he was worth all of them [together] and so too [a similar case], (Yehoshua 2,1), "Go see [and spy out] the land and Yericho"<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Yericho was as strong as the entire land combined (see Rashi there).</i> and so too [another similar case] "King Shlomo loved many foreign women and the daughter of Pharaoh."<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo cherished Pharaoh’s daughter as much as he did the rest of them put together. (See Rashi ibid).</i> (Kings I, 11, 1 ).

Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>His second [son] was Kilov.</b> [But] in another place<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Divrei Hayomim I, 3,1.</i> [Scriptures] calls him, "and his second [son] was Doniel".<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., refers to the second son of Dovid not as Kilov but as Doniel, his true name.</i> So why is his called [here] by the name of Kilov? Rebbe Yitzchok said [to answer this question] : Because the generation's cynics were saying that Avigail was pregnant from Novol,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">That Doniel was the son of Novol and not Dovid.</i> [consequently Hashem caused] his facial features to change and resemble his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">His resemblance to Dovid earned him the name of <span>כִלְאָב</span> a play on <span>כּוּלוֹ אָב</span>, “completely his father.”</i> And our Rabbis said<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Berochos 4a.</i> that [this name of Kilov was due to the fact that] he embarrassed Mephiboshes through Halacha.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Doniel’s superior knowledge became evident during the course of his halachic debates with Mipiboshes. According to this Derosho, the letters <span>כל</span> of <span>כִלְאָב</span> stand for <span>מַכְלׅים</span>.</i>

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>By Egloh</b> This refers to Michal<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The daughter of Shaul.</i> who was cherished by him. Similarly it says "If you had not plowed with my calf" (Shoftim 14, 18).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><span>עגלה</span>, “calf” is used in reference to a cherished wife just as a calf is cherished by it’s owner (See Sanhedrin 21a).</i> [But] it is written, "And Michal, the daughter of Shaul had no child until the day of her death" (Below, 6, 23) she didn't have one until the day of her death<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">At which time she died in childbirth (ibid).</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">That verse implies that Michal had no children up to the time of her death, but our verse states that Egloh, i.e. Michal gave birth to Yisrom.</i> From that incident<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid rejoiced excessively when the Ark was returned from captivity. Michal rebuked Dovid for what seemed to her to be behavior beneath his dignity. This was not the case and she was punished for the unwarranted shaming of Dovid. (ibid).</i> and on [she had no children], but prior to that incident she did have [children].

Verse 6

<b>Was strengthening.</b> With all his might over the house of Shaul, to establish its monarchy.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>Am I the chief dog [watcher] for [the kingdom of] Yehudah?</b> Am I at least as important as the chief dog watcher for Dovid. However, according to the cantillation which has the accent under [the word] <span>ראׁשׁ</span> and [the word] <span>כֶּלֶב אָנׂכׅי</span> coralled [together],<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi’s first explanation is assumming that the words <span>ראש</span> and <span>כלב</span> are connected. However, the cantillation indicates that they are separate. Instead, the words <span>כלב אנכי</span> belong together. This compels Rashi to offer an alternative explanation.</i> then this is the explanation: The chief? Do I want to be a chief in your house? It is better for me to be a dog and an ordinary person in the house of Dovid. This is also Yonasan's translation.
<b>From this day on should I [continue to] be kind.</b> From now on [is it] proper for me to be kind to the house of Shaul and with all those who love him as I have done until now and I have not delivered you into the hand of Dovid?

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>In his behalf saying.</b> From his place to say, We shall keep this [oath] by the One Who made the world.
<b>By He Who [posseses] the land.</b> [This is] language [used for] an oath, By He Who [posseses] the land. Another interpretation: "<b>Below him,</b>" [Avner] mentioned his name first in the message letter and afterwords he mentioned Dovid's name and that is why he was punished. [This is what] he wrote: From me, Avner, the general of Yisroel to Dovid, the king of Yisroel, peace salutation.
<b>To He who [deserves] the land.</b> To whom the kingdom is proper for him, I am sending to him "saying, Enact a convenant, etc."

Verse 13

<b>You first bring.</b> Before you see my face, bring me Michal.

Verse 14



Verse 15

<b>From [her] man.</b> Yonasan translated "from the company of her husband."

Verse 16

<b>Following and crying.</b> Over the good deed [about to be] leaving him because all those years he thrust a sword into the bed [separating] between him and her and he did not stumble [into sinful intimacy] with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Shaul did not consider her married to Dovid because he considered Dovid’s Kiddushin having been done using a loan which is an invalid Kiddushin. However, in fact, Dovid had used regular material wealth as his means for Kiddushin which made Dovid halachically married to Michal. This meant that Paltiel Ben Loyish was living in the same house with another man’s wife. For all those years Paltiel made sure never to touch her and thus was spiritually elevated by subduing his lustful inclination. Now that she was leaving, he was saddenned to no longer have the opportunity for this type of spiritual greatness. (Sanhedrin, ibid).</i>

Verse 17

<b>And the word of Avner was [sent]</b> Before this [incident with Paltiel]

Verse 18

<b>Said about Dovid.</b> About Dovid, and this is not [an instance of the usual] meaning of the word, <span>אל</span>, "to".

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21



Verse 22

<b>From an attack.</b> They sprung, attacking to take spoils from the enemy.

Verse 23



Verse 24



Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>From Bor HaSiroh.</b> The name of a place [But] the Rabbis said: A well and a thorn caused Avner to be killed, by not grasping unto the deeds of Dovid, by [ignoring] the jug of water that [Dovid] took from [under] the head of Shaul<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is reference to Shmuel I, 26,12 where Dovid was being pursued by Shaul and Avner. Dovid found them sleeping and hence vulnerable. Not wanting to harm them but wanting to show Shaul he had been there, Dovid took the spear and the jug of water that was underneath Shaul’s head.</i> and also [by ignoring] the corner of Shaul's garment<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Shmuel I, 24,5 where Shaul, in pursuit of Dovid, stopped temporarily inside the cave where Dovid was hiding with his men. Dovid did not kill him but surreptitiously caught off the corner of Shaul’s garment.</i> [Avner dismissed this and] he said "Perhaps one of the thorns caught upon [the garment] and tore it.

Verse 27

<b>Within the gate.</b> [Yoav brought Avner] before a sanhedrin to be judged<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The word <span>שַׁעַר</span> often refers to judges who usually hold court at the gate of the city, cf. Devorim 22,15.</i> for the [spilling of] blood of his brother, Asoel.
<b>Deceptively.</b> In a mistake provoking [way] so that Avner would not realize that it is in [Yoav's] heart to kill him. Cut up the verse [to rearrange it's words as follows] "and Yoav steered him deceptively to go within the gate to talk to him."

Verse 28



Verse 29

<b>[The guilt] should fall.</b> The [guilt of the] blood of Avner should rest, should fall. [This verse is] referring back to the preceding verse that stated, I and my kingdom are innocent from [the guilt of] the blood of Avner [The guilt of] his blood should fall on the head of Yoav. The blood [of Avner] that was mentioned in the previous verse.
<b>[A lame person] who leans on a cane.</b> Who leans on his cane because of diseased feet.

Verse 30

<b>Killed Avner.</b> [As if to say] Avner<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Without the <span>ל</span> because it is the object of the verse’s verb “killed.” Whereas Avner with the prefix <span>ל</span> would usually mean “to Avner.”</i> and similar to it [we find] "Snatch me, be my surety" (Yeshaiya 38, 14), Snatch me<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Not “to me” despite the verse using the word <span>לי</span>.</i> and also similarly (Bamidbar 12,13), "Please heal her" Heal her<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Not “to her” despite the verse using the word <span>לָהּ</span>.</i> and similarly to this (Divrei Hayomin II, 17, 7) "He sent his officers, Ben Chayil, and Ovadiah… to teach in the cities of Yehudah and it's meaning is: He sent his officers, Ben Chayil.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Not “to his officers, to Ben Chayil” despite the verse using the prefix <span>ל</span>.</i>

Verse 31



Verse 32



Verse 33

<b>The death of someone wicked.</b> Like the death by sword of a wicked person.

Verse 34

<b>Your hands were not bound.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This word belong with the three hebrew words in the headline, Rashi is filling the word that’s missing from the verse, the verb “were.”</i> How could a mighty soldier such as you fall before treacherous men.

Verse 35

Verse 2

<b>Were for the son of Shaul</b> Were for the son of Shaul similar to (Shmuel I, 13, 8) "until the time of Shmuel" of Shmuel.

Verse 3

<b>And the Be'erosites fled</b> When Shaul died, the people of Yisroel abandoned the cities that surround the Peleshtim as is mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel I, 31,7.</i> It was then that the Be'erosites fled.

Verse 4

<b>Yohanoson, the son of Shaul had.</b> [The verses] continue to recount how the monarchy was stripped from the house of Shaul. He and his sons were killed and this one [Ish Boshes] was killed on his bed and the son of Yohanoson fell and became lame.

Verse 6

<b>To the Yevusi.</b> The fortress of Tzion was called Yevus. [Its inhabitants] were from the descendants of Avimelech. They had two idols, one [depicting] a blind person and one [depicting] a lame person. They were made to represent Yitzhok and Yakov.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Yitzchak was blind at the end of his life (Bereshis, 27,1). Yakov was lamed during the course of his struggle with the angel (Bereishis 32,33).</i> [Placed] in their mouths was the oath Avrohom swore to Avimelech,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 21,23–24.</i> This is why they were not displaced [from Tzion]. When Yerushalayim was conquored The tribe of Yehuda did not conquor the fortress [of Tzion], as the verse states, (Yehoshua, 15, 63). "However the Yevusim who lived in Yerushalyim, the descendants of Yehudah were unable to expel them. [About this verse] it is learned: Rebbe Yohoshua, the son of Levi said, They had the ability to [expel the Yevusim] but they were not permitted to.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Because of Avrohom’s oath to Avimelech. This point is made in the Sifri, Re’ey, Piska 72. However, there it’s brought in the name of Rebbe Yehoshua, the son of Korcho.</i>
<b>And he said to Dovid.</b> Whoever said it,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The speaker is unidentified, but is obviously one of the Yevusim.</i>
<b>[The idols depicting] the blind and the lame</b> These were their idols.

Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>Whoever kills the Yevusi and touches [and destroys] the towers spire</b> Whoever kills the Yevusi and has the strength to conquor the fortress.
<b>And [the idols of] the lame.</b> And destroys [the idols of] the lame and the blind which were abhorrent to Dovid.
<b>Upon which they are saying.</b> Upon which they are saying, "The blind one and the lame one," i.e., while the blind one and the lame one are here.
<b>[Dovid] will not come</b> Dovid will not come here. This is a shortened verse [because] it stated, "Whoever kills the Yevusi and touches [and destroys] the tower's spire" but [the verse] does not explain what happens to the person [who reaches the spire]. However, in Divrei Hayomim I, 11, 6) it explains, "Whoever kills the Yevusi first will be made a chief and a prince." Similar to this [we find]. "Therefore, whoever kills Kayin" (Bereishis 4, 14) and [that verse] does not explain what happens to the person [who kills Kayin] but from its context, it's understood that the language conveys rebuke and anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To whoever kills Kayin.</i>
<b>And touches [and destroys] the tower's spire.</b> [This word] denotes the spire of a tower because that's where their idols were placed. [During] the days of Dovid, the generations of the oath had already passed.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Avimelech asked Avrohom to swear “that you will not deal falsely with me, with my son or my grandson.” These three generations had already passed when Dovid attacked the Yevusim in the fortress of Tzion.</i>

Verse 9

<b>From it's low wall and inwards.</b> A surrounding low wall; they would fill it up with earth, the summit of the mound would be in it's middle, and it would slant in all directions, that is called a <span>מלוא</span>, and Dovid built houses on [the wall]. That low wall surrounded the fortress.

Verse 21

<b>And Dovid burnt them.</b> Dovid and his men burnt them.

Verse 22

<b>The valley of Rephaim.</b> It is next to Yerusholoyim [as can be seen] in the book of Yehoshua (15, 8).

Verse 23

<b>From opposite the trees.</b> From opposite the trees.

Verse 24

<b>The sound of stepping on the tops of the trees.</b> These are angels stepping on the tops of the trees that I am sending to help you.
<b>Then shout [war whoops].</b> Lift up [and bring forth] the sound of war and the fear of the sword Galfer in Old French, and similarly [we find] "A dog will not sharpen its tongue [growl].

Chapter 6



Verse 1

<b>Dovid again gathered.</b> To gather.
<b>All the chosen men of Yisroel, thirty thousand.</b> Because they gathered for him when they crowned him in Chevron and [therefore] this was a second gathering [for Dovid] [Scripture] herefore says, "[Dovid] again gathered."

Verse 2

<b>From Baalei Yehuda.</b> This is [the city of] Kiryas Yearim as it is said in Yehoshua, "and the boundary circled" and went up "to Baaloh, which is Kiryas Yearim" (Yehoshua 15:9). This also [can be found] in Divrei Hayomim, "Dovid and all Yisroel went up to Baaloh, which is Kiryas Yearim" (Divrei Hayomim I, 13:6). [The word] Baal means a plain.
<b>Dovid arose and went from Baalei Yehuda.</b> That gathered there to bring up the Ark from there…
<b>Whose name is called, the name.</b> The Ark is called a name, and what is the name? The name of Adonoy of Hosts was upon it.

Verse 3

<b>On a new wagon.</b> [Dovid] made a mistake about something that even children at their Rebbe's school know "Because the sacred work was [incumbent] upon them, which they had to carry on their shoulders" (Bamidbar 7:9). And because [Dovid] said, "Your statutes were songs for me in the house of my dwelling,"<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem said to Dovid, “The words of the Torah upon which it is written, ‘Blink your eyes [and be distracted] from it and it is gone’ (Mishlei 23:5), you are calling songs?” (Sotah 35a). A song is of only temporary interest and then forgotten (Maharsho, ibid).</i> (Tehilim 119:54) he was punished to come to this,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Making the mistake of transporting the Ark by wagon.</i> and [to have] Uzoh die through his hand. Therefore<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">After learning from this mistake.</i> when they brought [the Ark] from the house of Oveid they brought it by shoulder as it says (Divrei Hayomim I, 15:12), "And he said to them, 'You, the heads of households for the Levites, you and your brothers sanctify yourselves and bring up the Ark… because, the first time you did it not.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Transporting the Ark on your shoulders.</i> Hashem, Elokeinu made a breach upon us because we did not consult with Him as was proper'."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Consequently leading to our tragic mistake.</i>

Verse 4

<b>With the Ark of Elokim.</b> This is a shortened verse, [it means to say] and they were coming with the Ark of Elokim.

Verse 5

<b>Dovid made a name [for himself].</b> He buried those of Edom whom he had killed and that is a good name for Yisroel that they bury their enemies. As it says in reference to the war of Gog and Mogog, "All the people of the land will bury and this will acquire for them a name." (Yechezkel 39:13) And how do we know that Dovid buried them? Because it says in the Book of kings (I, 11:15), "And it happened when Dovid was in Edom when Yoav, his army general went up to bury the corpses."

<b>Officers.</b> Officers to collect the tax.

Verse 15

<b>Dovid rendered judgement… Yoav…was [commander] over the army.</b> Dovid caused Yoav to be successful [with his command] over the army because he rendered judgment and righteousness and Yoav caused Dovid to render judgment and righteousness because he [Dovid] judged and Yoav policed and enforced on the basis [of the judgment].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi is learning that the proximity of the verse discussing Dovid’s judgment of the people to the next verse discussing Yoav’s commanding of the army shows that these two phenomena were related. Other prominent leaders are being discussed in the subsequent verses but Yoav is mentioned first immediately after king Dovid.</i> Another [reason is that] because Yoav busied himself with the battles, Dovid was not preoccupied by them and his heart was [able to be] open to judge righteously.

<b>The words of men of Yehudah overpowered.</b> Language similar to "Improve".<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Tsaphania 2:1.</i> The words of the men of Yehudah were more logical and they prevailed because they showed [as evidence] the letter Dovid had sent them [saying] "Why should you be the last to request" that the king return etc." This is what is explained in Agadah. Some explain <span>וַיִקֶשׁ</span> to denote hard and strong and that is Yonoson's translation, "overpowered."

Verse 4

<b>Rally the men of Yehudah.</b> That they should be here within three days.
<b>And then you be back here [to meet me].</b> After three days be sure to be back here before me because he [Dovid] wanted to chase after Shevah, the son of Bichri.

Verse 5

Verse 6

<b>Take your master's servants.</b> Now that Amosoh, the commanding officer was delayed and had not yet brought the soldiers of Yehudah, you take from the men in my entourage and chase after him.

Verse 8

<b>Close to his loins.</b> Very close to his body along the width of his loins, this was not the usual way of carrying a sword. He did so to make it easy for it to fall out so it would not be necessary to take it out of its sheath.
<b>He started out [towards Amosoh.].</b> Towards Amosoh.
<b>And it fell out.</b> The sword [fell out] from its sheath because it was smooth and sharp and was not hanging on the side of his thigh but it was along the width of his loins. As soon as he [Yoav] leaned forward towards the ground it [the sword] fell out of its sheath and he grabbed it with his right hand without Amosoh noticing anything.

Verse 14

<b>He [Shevah] went through all the tribes of Yisroel.</b> Shevah, the son of Bichri [went] to convince them to declare him king over them.
<b>All the Beirim.</b> I do not know what it is.

Verse 15

<b>And it [the city] held by virtue of its inner wall.</b> [Yonoson translates:] "They surrounded it strongly." Some interpret <span>וַתַּעֲמדׁ בַּחֵל</span> to have a meaning like "the inner wall and the outer wall".<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Eichoh 2:8.</i> They had [already] cause the outer wall to fall and it [the city] fortified itself to hold fast by virtue of the inner wall.

<b>Are you Yoav?</b> That it is said of you "Who sits among the wise at their assembly."<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Further on 23:8.</i>

Verse 18

<b>You should have talked [peace] first.</b> You should have talked peace first. If they had answered you that they wanted peace and had opened their city to you then you should not have gone to war against them.
<b>If you had asked [for peace] with Oveil.</b> If your soldiers had asked for peace with this city called Oveil.
<b>They would have completely [cooperated].</b> The people of the city would have immediately made peace with you.

Verse 19

<b>I am [from the people of the city] that are loyal and trustworthy to Yisroel.</b> I am from the people of the city that are loyal and trustworthy to Yisroel and to the king. An Aggadic Midrash [states:] this was Serach, the daughter of Asher. I faithfully rewarded those who faithful [to God]: Through me, the location of Yosef's coffin was revealed to Moshe. I told Yakov that Yosef was alive.

Verse 20

<b>Far be it, far be it from me.</b> Far be it from me, far be it from the king.

Verse 21

<b>Lifted his hand against the king, Dovid.</b> Against the king even if it were not Dovid he is punishable by death. Alternatively if it were against Dovid [who is a scholar] even if he was not the king, he [Shevah] is punishable by death. All the much more so [now that he has rebelled] against the king, against Dovid. This is how this verse is expounded upon in the Midrash Koheles.

Verse 22

<b>The woman came [and spoke] to all the people.</b> It is taught in a Tosefta:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Terumos 7:23.</i> "She said to them, 'Since both he will be killed and they will be killed [they should] hand him over to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To Yoav’s men.</i> If he were able to be saved, for example he was inside and you were on the outside and you were in mortal danger [fighting Yoav] [but] he could escape<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">While you would be fighting.</i> [then we have a rule that] it is prohibited to let one person be killed in order to save another, [therefore, you cannot] have him killed to save yourselves. But now that he is [anyway] going to be killed with you because the walls have been breached and there is no possibility of escape,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">For anyone.</i> [then] it is better that he alone die and you should not die along with him.' Rebbe Shimon said, this is what she said to them, 'Anyone who has rebelled against the kingdom of the House of Dovid is punishable by death.'<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Threfore Shevah must be killed in order for you to be spared.</i>

Verse 23

<b>Yoav commanded the entire army.</b> Despite the fact that Dovid had said to Amosoh, "I will make you the commanding general in Yoav's stead",<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Earlier in 19:14.</i> now that Amsoh was dead Yoav was not replaced.

Verse 25



Verse 26

<b>Eiroh the Yoiri.</b> Yonoson translated: "Eiroh who gives forth light from Tekuah." And so is he referred to in this book Eiroh ben Eikash of Tekuah. He was called Yoiri because it is taught in Menochos,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Menochos 85b.</i> "Tekuah was first in [olive] oil," because olive oil was prevalent there from which candles are lit [in the Beis Mikdosh].
<b>Was a Kokein for Dovid.</b> He [Dovid] would give him [Eiroh] all his Kehunah gifts, that is what our Rabbis explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Eiruvin 63a.</i> The simple explanation of the verse is that he [Dovid] made him [Eiroh] an officer and a judge.

Chapter 21



Verse 1

<b>On account of Shaul.</b> On account of the sin regarding Shaul who was buried immediately and secretly as the men of Yovish Gilod stole his body and buried him. [Consequently] he was not eulogized with the respect due him.
<b>And his bloody House.</b> Because he killed out Nov, the city of Kohanim.
<b>And because he killed the Givonim.</b> When he killed out Nov, the city of Kohanim, he killed seven people from among them [the Givonim]. Two wood cutters, two water drawers, the sexton, the announcer and the scribe. This is what is explained in Yerushalmi Talmud, in Maseches Sanhedrin.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 29a.</i> [But] our Rabbis said,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Yevomos 78b.</i> On account that he [Shaul] killed the Kohanim [of Nov] that provided food for them [the Givonim], consequently Scripture considers it as if he killed them [as well]. Do not wonder that God demanded retribution for the lack of respect given to him<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the proper eulogy due him.</i> and simultaneously demanded retribution for his sin,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">of killing out Nov.</i> because this what is what it is written, "Who has done His work,"<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Tsafanyoh 2:3.</i> when the person is being judged his good works [are remembered] this what we are taught in Maseches Yevomos.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Yevomos ibid, See Rashi there.</i>

Verse 2

<b>And spoke to them.</b> Words of appeasement [asking them] to put aside their feelings [of anger] and forgive Shaul and his household.
<b>The Givonim were not part of the Bnei Yisroel.</b> This is to say that they displayed how cruel they are, because they are not descendants of our forefather Avrohom. They have proven themselves unworthy to join with Yisroel and hence Dovid decreed that they not be permitted to marry into the Jewish community. He [Dovid] said, This nation [of Yisroel] has three characteristics, the people are merciful, they possess shame and perform kindful deeds for others. Whoever has these three characteristics is worthy of joining it [Yisroel].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">They have shown themselves to be cruel and unmerciful and hence they do not deserve to join together with Yisroel. Yevomos 79a.</i>
<b>Sworn to them [that they would let them live].</b> During the days of Yehoshua when he made woodcutters and water drawers for the Altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua 9:27.</i>
<b>In his zeal to avenge the Bnei Yisroel.</b> Because he [Shaul] intended to clean and purify Yisroel and to take care of their [Yisroel's] needs, he wanted to kill them. This anger was for a good purpose as we find "Are you zealous for my sake?"<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 11:29.</i> And we also find "by the zeal for God's sake" as was said of Yeihuh.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Melochim I, 19:10.</i> This is the simple explanation of our verse. [But] according to the Midrashic intepretation, he [Shaul] only ordered that the kohanim be killed. And the zeal described here was not for a good purpose but rather for a bad purpose because he [Shaul] knew that his kingdom would not continue further from the day that he did not heed God's commandment concerning Amoleik,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel I, 15:9.</i> and from that time on, he was angry [and persecuted] them.

Verse 3

<b>So that you should bless the heritage of Adonoy?</b> Pray for them.

Verse 4

<b>We are not interested in silver or gold from Shaul.</b> We are only interested in [retribution against] people. He [Dovid] wanted to appease them with money but they did not want [to accept it]. He [Dovid] said, "It may be that they are embarrassed of each other." [Therefore] he went and tried to appease each one individually [but] they [still] would not be appeased. That is why it is written here, "I am not interested in silver or gold etc" in singular form.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is written with <span>לִי</span> in singular form, but is read with <span>לָנוּ</span>, plural form indicating that Dovid tried to appease them both collectively as a group and also on an individual basis.</i> This I saw in the Yerushalmi Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 29a.</i>
<b>And we are interested in killing anyone.</b> Among the rest of the Bnei Yisroel because they did not agrieve us.

Verse 5

<b>And intended to destroy us.</b> He said in his heart that we should be destroyed [and prevented] by him "from establishing etc." He intended to destroy us.
<b>Intended.</b> He intended to destroy us.

Verse 6

<b>We will hang them.</b> Hanging.
<b>Before God.</b> In the name of God, to publicize His edict.
<b>The chosen one of God.</b> A heavenly voice came forth and said, "The chosen one of God."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Givonim who hated Shaul would be unlikely to call him, “the chosen one of God.”</i>

Verse 7

<b>The king had pity.</b> He prayed for pity on Mephivoshes that the Ark should not detain him; because Dovid had them [Shaul's children] pass before the Ark, whomever the Ark detained, was put to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., was handed over to the Givonim who subsequently put them to death. Yevomos 79a.</i>

Verse 8

<b>Sons of Michal, the daughter of Shaul who had bore them to Adriel.</b> Did Michal give birth [to these children]? It was Meirav who bore [those children] to [Adriel]. [The explanation is] that Meirav gave birth [to them] and Michal<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Meirav’s sister.</i> raised them, that is why they are called by her name because someone who raises male and female orphans in their house it is considered as if that person gave birth [to the child] and [the child] is called by his name.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 19a.</i>

Verse 9

<b>At the beginning of the harvest.</b> During the days of Nisson.

Verse 10

<b>Until the rains fell on them.</b> During the rainy season in Tishri. Their bones were not removed for burial. But is it not written, "His body should not remain [hanging] overnight"<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 21:22. Why did Dovid let this happen?</i>? However they reasoned that it is better that one of the letters of the Torah be uprooted in order that God's Name be publicly sanctified. Passersby would ask "Why have these people come to this fate?" They were told [in response], "They are royal sons." "What did they do [wrong]?" "They assaulted downtrodden foreigners." [The passersby] would say, "There is no people better to associate with then this people."<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Yevomos 79a.</i>

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>He took Shaul's bones.</b> He [Dovid] was told concerning them, "Because of Shaul"<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Earlier in 21:1.</i> who was not eulogized according to halachah.

Verse 13

<b>They gathered the bones.</b> Of the seven people that were hung there.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 9.</i>

Verse 14

<b>Everything that the king had commanded.</b> To eulogize them in all of the cities of Yisroel.

Verse 16

<b>A spear case weighing.</b> It is like a case that is at the top of spear's handle that is called aristuille in O.F., and it is made like a hat There is something comparable to it in Maseches Zevochim, "What were the pomegranates of the tunic<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Zevachim 88b. The tunic worn by the Kohein Godol.</i> similar to? They were like the caps on babies' heads" The caps [are called] hemles in O.F.
<b>Who was armed.</b> Armed with a new sword. I heard [an explanation] that on that day he was intitiated into the wearing of battle dress and it is the manner of those so initiated to [try to] be successful and mighty on the day of their initiation to make a name for themselves. That is why, <b>he said he was going to kill Dovid.</b>

Verse 17

<b>[Came] to his aid.</b> He helped him with his prayer as is brought in [chapter] Cheilek.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 95a.</i>

Verse 18

<b>There was more war.</b> This [war] came before all [those mentioned here] and is only recounted here to combine the deaths of the four sons of Orpoh.

Verse 19

<b>Elchonon.</b> Dovid.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">We know that it was Dovid who killed Golias in Shmuel I, 17:51, consequently this Elchonon must be Dovid.</i>
<b>The son of Yari [whose family] were weavers.</b> His family weaved the partition curtain of the Beis Hamikdosh that is [also] called a forest.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Beis Hamikdosh is called a forest because it was made with planks of acacia wood, see Shmos 26:15.</i>
<b>Like that of the weaver's rod.</b> [Yonoson translates:] "Like the weaver's rod," that is called "ensouple" in O.F. Let a weaver come and stand up against a weaver['s instrument].

Verse 20

<b>A giant man.</b> As [Yonoson] translated, "A man of [great] measure," the root [portion] of the word are the letters <span>מ</span> and <span>ד</span>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The <span>ין</span> being a suffix.</i> We find [similarly] from the word <span>שאון</span><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 65:8.</i> [roar] the root letters are <span>ש</span> and <span>א</span> and from the word <span>הָמוֹן</span><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 17:4.</i> the root letters are <span>ה</span> and <span>מ</span>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">These two words also having <span>ין</span> as a suffix.</i> In Divrei Hayomim<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Divrei Hayomim I, 11:23.</i> it is written, "A man of measure"<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning this same giant refered to in our verse but there the word <span>מִדָּה</span> is used without the suffix <span>ין</span>.</i> i.e., a very tall man who had people measuring his height.
<b>Numbered six each etc.</b> Our Rabbis explained in Maseches Bechoros<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"></i> that the verse had to tell us "twenty-four"<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that given that his two hands and two feet had six digital extremities each, which obviously totals twenty-four.</i> in order that you should not say that the fingers of his two hands only came to a total of six and that the toes of his [two] feet only came to a total of six that is why it is written, "twenty-four." If it had written in our verse only 'twenty-four" and not had said "six each," I would have [mistakeingly] said, there were seven on one [hand or foot] and five on the other. And what is the verse trying to indicate by the word "number"? That all these digital extremities could be counted in the normal arrangement of fingers on a hand.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

<b>On the day Adonoy saved him.</b> In his old age after all his troubles had passed and he had survived all of them.
<b>And from the hands of Shaul.</b> Shaul was part of the general grouping [of "his enemies"]?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. Why is he being singled out?</i> but he was his greatest enemy and pursuer. Similarly [we find], "Nineteen men and Asohel<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Earlier in 2:30. where Asohel is singled out because he was equal to all of them as Rashi points out there.</i> Similarly, "Go spy out the land and Yericho."<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua 2:1.</i> And similarly, "King Shlomo loved [many] foreign women and [he loved] the daughter of Pharoah."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Melochim I, 11:1.</i>

Verse 2

<b>My Rock, my Fortress.</b> They are words denoting strength. Rock is obvious in its connotation [of strengh]. Fortress is [a reference to] a fortress amongst the forests that is called flassant in O.F. It is [also] a reference to the miracle that occurred by the rock at the crossroads<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel I, 23:28.</i> and the fortresses of the forest.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid, 23:19. Dovid’s location was betrayed to Shaul but eventually when Shaul reached the crossroads, he chose not to chase after Dovid.</i>
<b>My Rescuer.</b> He saved me when I was with Yisroel's army at war and other times He saved me when I was alone<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi is explaining why Dovid in effect, says “me” twice. <span>מְפַלְטי</span> means “My Rescuer” and <span>לי</span> means “me”.</i> for example [He saved me] from (the inhabitants of Nov)[“Yishbi-Benov”].

Verse 3

<b>My Rock.</b> Language denoting a rock because a rock protects passerby from the rain and from the winds. Abriments in O.F.
<b>I take refuge.</b> Language denoting a covering that I was able to be protectively covered.
<b>My Stronghold.</b> He supported me.
<b>My Refuge.</b> I would run to him for protection.

Verse 4

<b>I call to Adonoy in praise.</b> As it is translated, when I called Him, I praised Him (with my mouth) because I trusted that I would be saved from my enemies. And it is possible to interpret the words <span>אֶקְרָא</span> and <span>אִוׇּשֵׁעַ</span> as being used in the present tense.

Verse 5

<b>Surrounded me.</b> Surrounded me.
<b>Death's destruction.</b> As [Yonoson] translates, "Like a woman sitting on the birthing chair," that is the name of the stone seat where women give birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It’s name in hebrew is <span>מַשְׁבֵּר</span>.</i>

<b>Were before me.</b> Came before me.

Verse 7

<b>In my distress I called to God… He hears.</b> This is typical of the present tense it uses both past and future at the same time.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><span>אֶקְרָא</span> is in past tense and <span>וַיִשְׁמַע</span> is in future tense.</i>

Verse 8

<b>Shook and shuddered.</b> This is not referring to the miracles that happened to him but to the miracles that happened to Yisroel and the beginning of the verse is connected to the end.
<b>When God became angry.</b> The word <span>כי</span> is being used here to mean "when," and this is its interpretation, when God became angry on account of his antagonists the world shook and shuddered and the pillars of heaven trembled and shook.

Verse 9

<b>Smoke rose from His Nostrils.</b> Such is the manner of an angry person, smoke comes out of his nostrils and so [we find], "Smoke has risen from My nostrils."<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 65:5.</i> This is always the meaning of the words "Anger of the nose," the nose flares and lets out air.
<b>Fire from His Mouth consumed [the wicked].</b> Through the decree utterred from His Mouth fire [came forth] and consumed the wicked.

Verse 10

<b>He bent heaven.</b> To take revenge from His enemies, from Mitzrayim and from Pharoah.

Verse 11



Verse 12

<b>He put [a protective] darkness around.</b> For [protective] cover as it says, "The pillar of cloud and the darkness separated between Mitzrayim and Yisroel."<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Shemos 14:20.</i>
<b>Abundant waters, thick clouds of the sky.</b> From where did the darkness come? They came from thick clouds that sprinkle water on the earth.
<b>Sprinkled.</b> [This is] language that denotes a sieve, [the water] falls to the earth in small droplets. This [same language] is used in many places in Aggadah, "They dice it in a sieve," Some interpret <span>חַשְׁרַת</span> as denoting a binding, that the skies became bound up with clouds because of the water [in them] as [the word] "the spokes"<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Melochim I, 7:33.</i> used [in connection with] the wheels of a wagon. They are wooden spokes that bond and bind the wheel's perimeter together.

Verse 13

<b>From the brightness before Him.</b> You should not conclude that He dwells in darkness<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because the previous verse mentioned darkness in connection with God. Furthermore, the verse here is describing punishment meted out to Yisroel’s enemies. The verse is telling us that the punishment’s source is light.</i> but rather it is light that is within the boundary and it is from that light that is before Him that the burning coals of fire [came forth]. [It is from there] that the arrows were shot at Mitzrayim.

Verse 44

<b>Antagonists.</b> From Doeg, Achitophel, Shaul and the Ziffites.
<b>You preserved me to be a leader of nations.</b> He kept me hidden for this purpose. The Midrash Aggadah [interprets our verse], "Dovid said, "Master of the universe, spare me from [potential] judgement concerning [the people of] Yisroel for if I shall cause [Yisroel] to turn away [from You] or I rule them harshly during the course of my service I will be punished [by You]. Rather, make me the leader of the Pelishtim and let them serve me [because] I will not be punished on their account.

Verse 45

<b>Lied to me.</b> Out of fear they told me lies.

Chapter 23



Verse 1

<b>These are Dovid's words.</b> Dovid's last prophecy. What were the first words? The words of the song that were said above.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"></i> But all the songs and praises that he [Dovid] said are not called "words".<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The use of the word <span>דִּבְרֵי</span> here denotes prophecy, not songs and praises.</i>
<b>Raised on high.</b> Raised from Above.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The word <span>עָל</span>, is used to denote <span>לְמַעְלָה</span>, “Above.”</i>
<b>Sweet songs for Yisroel.</b> Yisroel does not sing any songs in the Beis Hamikdosh other then his [Dovid's] songs and hymns.

Verse 2

<b>Speaks through me.</b> He bestowed His holy spirit on me and spoke through me. Whenever [the verse refers] to prophecy, the word <span>דִּבֵּר</span> is appropriate as [we find] "Did [Adonoy] only speak to Moshe, He also spoke to us."<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 12:2.</i> "I will speak through him."<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 12:6.</i> The reason for it is because the spirit enters into the prophet and speaks through him.

Verse 3

<b>The Rock of Yisroel spoke to me.</b> The Rock of Yisroel spoke to and commanded me that I should be a ruler over men, over Yisroel who are called "men" as it is written, "You are men." [He also told me] that I will be a righteous person, a ruler and a God fearing person. Our Rabbis interpreted [this verse] with a different explanation:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Moed Koton 16b.</i> Dovid said [as follows:] "The God of Yisroel spoke to me, the Rock of Yisroel spoke to me, I am ruler over men. And who rules over me? The righteous man, because I [may] issue a decree and he [can] annul it." But according to the flow of these verses it is the first explanation that is the simple interpretation of these verses.

Verse 4

<b>As day breaks with the sun shining.</b> He promised me that my glory will continuously grow like the light at day break which gets brighter and brighter.
<b>A cloudless morning.</b> A light that does not dim.
<b>[Brighter] then the light that comes with the rain that nourishes the land.</b> My morning is brighter then the light that comes with rain, which is a clear warmth [shining forth] rays of light. When the rain falls on vegetated earth and the sun shines on it and causes it to brighten. And this is how the verse is interpreted, More then the light that comes from rain [falling on] vegetated earth.

Verse 5

<b>For is not my house with God.</b> That I should have a cloudy morning.
<b>For an eternal convenant.</b> [This refers to] the Torah that He placed for me, that He has arranged for all my household, and kept there.
<b>All my hopes and desires [are before God].</b> My needs are set before Him. This is a shortened verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The verse itself mentions Dovid’s hopes and desires but does specify anything further about them.</i>
<b>Because [my kingdom] will never be outgrown.</b> There will be no other king after my kingdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As God promised Dovid earlier in 7:13 that his kingdom will be eternal.</i> Another interpretation: He has made an eternal convenant for my House, that my kingdom shall be everlasting and this convenant is known to all, it is mentioned by all the prophets.

Verse 6

<b>Like an itinerant thorn.</b> <i>Cordon</i> in O.F. When [this thorn is] young it is soft. It then travels to and fro and eventually hardens until it is [so sharp that it is] unable to be held in one's hand.

Verse 7

<b>Any man wanting to touch them should don.</b> He must cover his body with armor and arm himself with a weapon to cut it down
<b>They will be completely burnt totally consumed by fire.</b> There is no solution other then burning [these thorns] and to sit and warm oneself by the fire. So too, for the wicked there is no solution other then burning in Gehennom.
<b>[While one] sits.</b> [A reference to] God sitting on the throne of Judgement.

Verse 8

<b>That were with Dovid, who sat in the council.</b> Who sat in the Sanhedrin Court. That is [alluded to by the word] wisdom. "He was a leader in three [distinct areas]," He was first in beauty, wisdom and strength. He was the leader in these three categories as it is written "[A man] of understanding of attractive build and a strong soldier."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel I, 16:18.

<b>But only to strip [the corpses].</b> Yonoson translates: "To strip the dead." There was no one to help him kill [the Pelishtim] but they were all stripping the corpses after [he had killed them].

Verse 11

<b>From the mountain.</b> From the mountain.
<b>For [war like] beast in the wild.</b> [Gathering] to become troops like the beasts gather in the wild.

Verse 14

<b>And a contingent of Pesishtim was then in Beis Lechem.</b> The [Pelishtim] army was camped in the Rephoim valley and they had sent a contingent to Beis Lechem.

Verse 15

<b>Who will give me water to drink.</b> Our Rabbis said,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Kama 60b. See Rashi there.</i> he [Dovid] needed to ask a [halachic] question from the Sanhedrin court that sat at the gate of Beis Lechem.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The “water” of our verse is referring to Torah which is compared to water. See Devorim Raboh 7:3.</i>

Verse 16

<b>He offered it as a libation to Adonoy.</b> He said, "This is what I learned at Shmuel the Romosi's court: If anyone risks his life for words of Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi is continuing with the interpretation of the verse that the water is a reference to words of Torah.</i> we should not recite the halachah in his name." If so, what is meant by "And instead he offerred it as a libation to Adonoy",<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This sounds as if Dovid has accepted the halachic ruling.</i> he [only] recited it in the name of the Gemorah.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The ruling is not to be said over in their name.</i>

Verse 17

Verse 1

<b>Adonoy's anger was again kindled against Yisroel.</b> I do not know what it was [they did].

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>Their [current] number.</b> [Yoav meant with] the word <span>כׇּהֵם</span> to convey that their amount should double and the second word <span>וְכָהֵם</span>, to convey a second doubling to have now a total of four times [the original population] and then to again double the [new] total for one hundred times.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For a total of two hundred times the current population.</i> It follows that Yoav's blessing was more then Moshe's who said, "One thousand times you [current] number".<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 1:11.</i> Furthermore, Moshe's blessing was only [to take effect] a long time [into the future] but Yoav's was intended [to take effect] immediately as it says [here], "[With] my master, the king's eyes [being able to] see it."

Verse 9

<b>The sum of the people's census.</b> If there was a counting, why was a [second] counting [needed]?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The verse uses two different words but they both mean “counting.”</i> He [Yoav] made two countings, one major one and one smaller one. He reasoned, "I will show him [Dovid] the smaller one and if he gets angry, I will show him the larger one." That is why the verse uses the word <span>מִפְקָד</span> which conveys [that something is] missing. This is how [the verse] is interpreted in the Pesikta.
<b>Yisroel's [total] was.</b> They became enfeebled like a woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><span>וַתִּהִי</span> is the feminine conjugation.</i>
<b>Eight hundred thousand.</b> But in Divrei Hayomim<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Divrei Hayomim I, 21:5.</i> it says, "One million and one hundred thousand"? In the Aggadah of the Amoroyim<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Pesikta Raba 11.</i> we find, Rabbi Yehoshua, the son of Levi said The verses fill in in one place what is missing in another place; there are two tribes which were not counted<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">And they account for the difference.</i> because this is what is written in Divrei Hayomim,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 21:6.</i> "Levi and Binyomin were not counted among them because the king's command was abhorrent to Yoav." Yoav said, With these [tribes] I can escape [from my commitment] and say [as an excuse] The tribe of Levi is not counted together with the rest of the tribes but [instead] is counted from one month old and up<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 2:15.</i> [and as far as] Binyomin [is concerned] it is enough that [their ranks] were depleted by the incident of the concubine in the valley.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The story is related in Shoftim beginning in chapter 19.</i> In the tract about the thirty-two rules [by which the Torah is elucidated] [authored] by Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Yosse the Galilite we learned [as follows], one verse says,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Divrei Hayomim I, 21:5.</i> "The [total of] all Yisroel was one million and one hundred thousand… and Yehudah [totaled] four hundred and seventy thousand."

The difference between the two [accounts] is three hundred thousand." What happenned to them?
