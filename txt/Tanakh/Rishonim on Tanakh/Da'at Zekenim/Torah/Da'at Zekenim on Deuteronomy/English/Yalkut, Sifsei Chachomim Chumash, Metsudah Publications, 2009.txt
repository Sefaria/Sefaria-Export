<b>But no one will buy.</b> Rav Yosef Kara explains that the Egyptians will say, evn if you give them to us for free we will not take them as slaves, for our ancestors enslaved their ancestors, and were struck with many plagues. When the captors realize that these slaves are not worth anything to them, they will strike them with sticks and starve them.

<b>For what did Hashem do this?.</b> If it is because of the sins of murder or immorality, other nations also sin in this manner, yet their countries are not destroyed like this. They will say, in other words, they will think that this action was justified, because the Jewish people willingly entered a covenant with Hashem, and afterwards they abandoned it. But other nations never entered into a covenant, and cannot be held accountable in the same way. Therefore they will accept Hashem’s justice, that Hashem exiled them from their land due to their wickedness, for transgressing the covenant.

<b>The Rock who bore you.</b> You have forgotten Hashem, who created you in your mother’s womb, and gave birth to you, because of these new idols which are worthless.

Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>I will hide My face.</b> The meaning is as Onkelos translated, “I will remove My Divine Presence from them.” After that I will see what becomes of them. How will all their idols help them?  
<b>For they are an upsetting generation.</b> They turn all the good that I do for them into evil. They deny the Torah and find the mitzvos disgusting.

<b>Peoples shall assemble at the mountain.</b> When they saw many nations coming by sea, they would make vows and promises to bring offerings on Mount Tziyon, out of fear.  

<b>And the hidden treasures.</b> When a boat sinks in boat, they throw everything overboard, and those who find the boat hide everything in the sand. The verse means that they will take everything for themselves, even the boat and the possessions hidden in the sand.

Verse 22

<b>Don is a lion cub.</b> He stands on the border and guards all of Yisroel, preventing enemies from entering the land. 
<b>Bounding from Bashan.</b> He drinks from the Yardein River, which draws its waters from Bashan. The source of the Yardein is the Banyas cave which is in the land of Don. This is why it is called Yardein, because it comes down from Don [<i>Yoreid Don</i>].

Verse 23

<b>Naftoli’s desire is satisfied.</b> His land ripens produce quickly, and he is satisfied from it. A place where the produce is not quick to ripen does not satisfy ones’ desire, because the desire comes before the produce. 
<b>And he is full of Hashem’s blessing.</b> Anyone who comes to the land of Naftoli and sees the blessing on the produce and the blossoming trees praises and blesses Hashem.
