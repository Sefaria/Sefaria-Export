And what is written afterwards [are the laws concerning] a man’s rebellious ad wayward son, and thus we find in the case of David who took [Maacah] the daughter of Talmi, the King of Gashur, at the end of their battle, and [together] they bore [a son] Absalom, who [as it would turn out] tried to kill David and slept with his wives (i.e. concubines), and because of his hand many Israelites were killed.
