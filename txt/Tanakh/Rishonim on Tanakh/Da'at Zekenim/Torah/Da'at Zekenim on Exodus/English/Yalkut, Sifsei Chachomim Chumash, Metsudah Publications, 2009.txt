<b>Adonoy is the righteous One.</b> Pharaoh came to this realization in the plague of hailstones more than the other plagues, because Hashem told the Egyptians to shelter their flock, and all the animals that were not sheltered died. Therefore, Pharaoh said that Hashem is the righteous One because he was forewarned, “and I and my people are the sinners,” for in their wickedness they left their animals in the fields and did not believe.

<b>For there was no house.</b> Obviously there were homes in which no living first born was to be found at the time. The <i>Sifri</i> relates, however, that whenever a first born child of an Egyptian family died they would erect a statue of him. Then when the plague struck, these statues also either shattered or melted, which was as painful to the family as the day of the death. It is also taught that mice came and rummaged after the corpses of first born children that had been buried on the premises and this, too, was as painful for them as the day of their deaths.

<b>Not one (literally, “until one”).</b> In other words, <i>one</i> did remain alive—Pharaoh himself. Although in Tehillim (106:11) it is written, “not one of them remained,” that only means that no one remained of the hosts he brought with him.

<b>They shall make.</b> Regarding all the other vessels it is written, “<i>You</i> shall make.” Only regarding the ark is it written, “<i>They</i> shall make.” The entire nation had to participate in the construction of the ark to show honor towards the Torah that was housed within it. This is a hint that all the residents of a town must show honor towards the Torah scholars among them by tending to their needs. Another reason that everyone had to help in the making of the ark was to ensure that all would have a share in the Torah’s reward.
<b>Inside and out.</b> According to Rova this is a hint that a scholar must be as righteous on the inside as he appears to be on the outside.

<b>Out of acacia wood standing.</b> The simple meaning is that it was forbidden to use wood from trees that had already fallen. Instead, they were required to cut down trees that were still standing. Alternatively, this is a hint that the components of the Tabernacle will “stand” (i.e. endure) forever. Thus even today they are still in existence, hidden away somewhere.

<b>From evening to morning.</b> According to Rashi it did not matter that extra oil would remain in the lamps after the short nights of summer. The Riva, however, considers it improbable that they would have wasted so much oil day after day. He suggests, therefore, that the thickness of the wick was varied to ensure that the oil would be consumed.

<b>But You did not let me know.</b> All God said to him was, “Behold, My angel will go before you” (32:33). He did not even tell him <i>which</i> angel. Moreover, every person in the world is accompanied by an angel; so where was the evidence that he had “found favor” in God’s eyes?

Verse 13

<b>Please let me know Your way.</b> Accompany me in person and inform me of the way I am to go.
<b>So that I will know.</b> This is how I will know that I have indeed found favor in Your eyes.

<b>See, Ad-noy has designated.</b> Betzalel was Miriam’s grand-nephew (see Rashi); therefore some people complained that Moshe was assigning all the positions of authority to his family members. In response he said to them, “See (i.e. “Know”) that I did not choose Betzalel on my own, rather Hashem designated him by name”.
