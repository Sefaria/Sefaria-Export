Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

As if to say, in the beginning of all creating the creator created the heavens and the earth - like 'in the reishis - beginning' of the rule of yehoyakim which is the head of the rule of yehoyakim

<b>the sixth day.</b> In all of them it only said, "day one", "second day", except for sixth day and seventh day, about which it said <b>the</b> sixth day and <b>the</b> seventh day. This is because they are singled out, because when Moshe our teacher wrote the Torah to Yisra'el, when he reached sixth day he said to them, "This is the sixth day on which the Holy Blessed One gives you double rations", and when he reached Shabbat he said to them, "And this is the seventh day which the Holy Blessed One commanded to honour it and to keep it. And you can also see this in the rivers (Bereishit 2:11-14) - in each of them the text states "it goes to such a place", since they [Yisra'el] didn't know their courses, it explains which place. But when it gets to the Euphrates (Bereishit 2:14) it only says "is the Euphrates" - that I said to you its area of the land of Yisra'el, as it says "until the great river, the river Euphrates, shall be its borders" (Yehoshua 1:4). And so here it says "the sixth; the seventh" that are explained to you in another place.

<b>For on the day you eat from it, you will certainly die:</b> Meaning to say, know that your end will be to die. You will certainly die, such that you will not be saved from death at the time of [your] end. But He did not say that he would die on that day.


Chapter 3



Verse 1

<b>The serpent was more cunning:</b> It spoke to the woman with wisdom and slyness.
<b>Did God really say, etc.:</b> Meaning to say, "Even though this garden is so beloved before the Holy One, blessed be He, such that He brought rivers to water it and commanded Adam to guard it - did He really say not to eat from its fruit?" The woman said to it, "'From the fruit of the trees of the Garden we may eat' (Genesis 3:2), and He did us [another] goodness: For he only prevented us from the tree of knowledge for our [own] good, lest we die. As He did not want to hurt us, since it is poison." He said to her, "Fool! He did not intend it for your good, it is not poison and you will not surely die if you eat from it. Rather He intended it for your detriment. As it is so good that He does not want you to eat from it. For if you eat from it, you will become wise and sly and you will become like the angels, to distinguish between good and evil, to be wise and sly and no mystery will baffle you. But He does not want you to reach the category of angels."

Verse 6

<b>The woman saw that the tree was good for food:</b> She began to observe it. She said, "How beautiful is this fruit; how sweet is its smell - it is certainly not like poison. Yet the Holy One did not command us not to eat from it for nothing." And the tree was desirable to her to contemplate; as she desired it, in order to contemplate. She said, "It appears that the serpent is speaking truth." So she ate it and gave it to her husband. And immediately slyness, pride, coarseness, jealousy, competition, covetousness and malice entered into them; to entrap and flatter, and to carry on in the dark, to rob and to steal. And they quickly began to say, "It is a disgrace for creatures like us to be 'baring buttocks' and revealing our nakedness." They made loincloths for themselves to cover their nakedness and they went out of the Garden to the breeze of the day, a place that there were no trees blocking the wind. As this is the way of thieves, to distance themselves from the the place in which they stole; meaning to say, "I was not even there." But while they were there sitting in the breeze of the day, they heard the 'voice of the Lord marching in the tops of the <i>baca</i> trees.' They said, "Behold the Master of the Garden has come"; so they were afraid and trembling - as is the way of a thief - and they hid. And that is the meaning of (Genesis 3:8), <b>They heard the voice of the Lord God moving in the Garden to the breeze of the day</b> - as they were there. Know that "to the breeze of the day," is referring to Adam. As it is written after it, <b>and the man and his wife hid themselves [...] among the trees of the Garden</b> - implying that at first, they were not in the Garden.

Verse 7



Verse 8



Verse 9

He said to him, <b>"Where are you?</b>" For this is the way of the Holy One, to speak like people to [other] people.

Verse 10

He said, "It was since, <b> I heard Your voice in the Garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, etc.":</b> He was afraid, lest He would ask him, "Why did you hide to escape," and He would become aware about his theft. Hence he gave Him a reason beforehand.

Verse 11

The Holy One said to him, "From your words, you are caught! How many times did I come to you and you were not concerned that you were naked." As it is written above (Genesis 2:25), "The two of them were naked." "But now you are concerned? <b>Who told you that you were naked?</b>" As only something that is fit for clothing, but does not have any, is called naked. It is not customary to say that a beast is naked, since it is not fit for clothing. For it is covered with the covering that is fit for it. And even great people who wear inferior clothing call themselves naked, because they do not have clothes that are fit for them. "And you also call yourself, naked" - meaning to say, that you are fit for clothes. "Who told you that you are fit for clothes? <b>From the tree whereof, etc.</b>"

Verse 12

Once he saw that one cannot cover up before the One that knows all secrets, he confessed against his will and said, "The iniquity is not upon me, but rather upon the woman." The woman said, "The iniquity is upon the serpent." As this is the way of thieves - when they are caught, they give away one another. The serpent did not find an answer, for we do not [allow] an inciter to make a claim - as our Rabbis said (Sanhedrin 29a): As even though they should not have listened to him - for [in a case of] the words of the teacher and the words of the student, to whom does one listen - nevertheless, he should not have entrapped [them], as they transgressed the commandment of the Creator. And they all confessed that they transgressed - as the Holy One said to Adam, "<b>Because you listened to the voice of your wife,</b> (Genesis 3:17) more than [to] My voice." And all the more so, the woman should not have listened to the serpent, who was not her friend and advisor. Hence Scripture said to Adam, "Because you listened to the voice of your wife"; whereas it did not say to the woman, "Because you listened to the voice of the serpent." As it an a fortiori argument, so there is no need [to say it]. And the Holy One, blessed be He, began to curse them in the way that they did the transgression: The snake that started was cursed first, and Adam afterwards.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>On your belly shall you crawl:</b> It is the way for people that give evil counsel to each other, to have them separated from one another. Hence He said to the serpent, "'On your belly shall you crawl' - such that your mouth be placed on the land, whereas she will be erect, so that you will not have a place in which to take counsel with her. <b>And dust shall you eat all the days of your life:</b> Given that your mouth will be on the land, you will eat it against your will. <b>And enmity will I put (Genesis 3:15):</b>" This too is a distancing. 

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>And to the woman He said,</b> "How many evils have you caused yourself! Until now you didn't need to bear children, because you were not [destined] to die. But from now on, you will need to bear children, because you will surely die. If you don't give birth, the world will dissolve, since you will die. So therefore, 'I will increase [...] your pregnancy' - and that is 'your pain' - because 'in pain will you bear children.' For how much pain is there with children: The pain of pregnancy, the pain of birth and the pain of raising [them]. And don't fool yourself to say, 'I'll nullify the commandment of being fruitful, just as I nullified the commandment of the tree of knowledge, such that I won't sleep with my husband.'" That is why it is written, <b>your longing will be for your husband</b> - that you will desire him. And if you say, "I will conquer my impulse because of the pain" - it is hence stated <b>and he will rule over you,</b> so he will take you against your will.

Verse 17

<b>And to Adam he said,</b> "Given that you have eaten from the tree and the evil impulse has entered so greatly into you, there is no protection [from you] besides the knife." As if man was not afraid of death, he would rob, extort, abuse and destroy the world because of the evil impulse. Therefore He penalized him with death; and also [with] exertion, which 'causes iniquity to be forgotten.'
And that blessing that He blessed them on the sixth day, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28), was after they were corrupted, such that reproduction was necessary. Know [that it is so], as it is written [there], "fill the earth and subdue it." And if it was before they were corrupted, He should have said, "fill the Garden," since that is where they resided before [this]. Rather that blessing was after they were corrupted, but it was  written with the creation [earlier nevertheless].

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Because she was the mother of all the living:</b> And even though she was not the mother of the animals and the beasts, "mother" implies an expression of [being] a matron, as in (Judges 5:7), "I arose, a mother in Israel." And "father" is likewise an expression of lordship and authority, as in (Genesis 4:21), "the father of all who handle the lyre."

Verse 21

<b>Garments of skins:</b> That is to say, garments for the skin of their flesh; as no beast had yet been flayed. And likewise did Onkelos translate [it].

<b>And Lemech said to his wives</b> - the explanation of Rav Yosef Karo of blessed memory: since Lemech married two wives first, they would fight and envy one another and each would anger her rival, and they would make a cacophony. He said to them, "What is my sin above all men that there is no peace in my house?! No [peace] in eating, nor in drinking, nor in lying down, nor in arising - have I killed people, or strangled babies, that this thing should happen to me which never happened to any person?! And now, look, I'm dying at your hands! I can't bear all of this! But the Holy Blessed One will exacted payment for this! For Kayin who sinned, God said God would take revenge seventy times -- all the more so God should take revenge for me seventy-seven!" And this comes to teach us that man shouldn't have many wives, because that's trouble and strife. And it seems to me that in those days they were far-seeing and wise, and they knew a flood would come in the days of Lemech, for you don't find genealogies for the children of Lemech because they would drown in the flood. The wives of Lemech heard this and wanted to separate from Lemech. They said, "Why should we birth for vanity, and suffer the pain of pregnancy and birth and child-rearing?" And he said to them and comforted them, "Don't believe that the Holy Blessed One would do this, for have I killed a man or strangled youths, that this should happen to me and my children should be drowned? The Holy Blessed One took pity on Kayin - should They not do this all the more so for me?" And he seduced them with words until he had offspring from them, and it seems to me that this is why these children of Lemech learnt these crafts, since they weren't blessed in agriculture because of the curse of Kayin in their youth, and regarding this matter it was explained by Targum Onkelos.

<b>But (ach) your blood of your lives will I require:</b> Because it permitted to spill the blood of beasts, it forbade the spilling of the blood of man, even one's own blood. [This is] so that they will not say, "Is it not that [since] the blood of a beast is permitted for us to spill because they live through us, [so] too a man who lives through himself should be permitted to kill himself? Hence it is stated, "of your lives I will require"...

"And it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you". A symbol and a sign that I am the Master and you are my servants, and the sign is sealed in a private place that will not be seen. The reason for this is so that the (non-Jewish) nations of the world won't say that the Jews are blemished ("ba'alei mumin"). And since the Holy One, Blessed be He, commanded men and not women, we learn that the place of manhod ("makom zachrut") was where God commanded to seal the covenant. And the blood of niddah that women guard, and tell their openings to their husbands, this is to them the blood of the covenant ("dam brit").

Verse 2

And he saw and behold, 3 men: according to the simple understanding these were normal men for we don't find that angels eat and drink and recline in a man's house like in the house of Lot, like we said with the angel said to Manoach ‘If you detain me, I will not eat your food, etc...'. However, one should not reject the words of the Sages, who also viewed them as angels with awareness of earthly matters. And in any case, it is forbidden to teach that they were angels as proof of their physicality, as this could support the heretical argument of those who claim the three were three parts of a god. If so, why would one of those parts need to enter a woman—as did their 'christian,' who took on flesh? Here, they had flesh to eat and drink and did not need to enter a woman’s womb."

<b>God has made laughter for me:</b> Meaning to say that is why jis name is called Yitzchak - since people will laugh (<i>yitzchaku</i>) at me, saying, "Have you seen Sarah, she gave birth at 90 years, and she began now to [...]."

Verse 7

<b>Who would have declared to Avraham:</b> Meaning to say, who would have said to Avraham that this thing occurred - that Sarah nursed children? No one would have said this to him, since he would not have believed [it] and [the speaker] would have been in his eyes, like a joker.  

Verse 8



Verse 9



Verse 10

<b>For the son of this maidservant shall not inherit:</b> Meaning to say, it is not right that the son of the maidservant inherit with my son. And therefore I do not want that he should live here, lest he should say after our death, "I am also the son of Avraham," and come to inherit.

Verse 11

<b>And this thing was very bad:</b> Meaning to say, it was difficult in his eyes about Hagar, but it was very difficult for him about his son. Therefore He said to him (Genesis 21:12), "Do not let it be bad in your eyes concerning the youth and concerning your maidservant."

Verse 12

<b>For it is through Yitzchak that your seed will be called:</b> Your main seed is Yitzchak; that seed about which He said, "to you and to your seed will I give this land" (Genesis 13:15).

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>He placed on her shoulder</b> the skin [of water] and the bread; but the child [he placed] into her hands, since he was fourteen.  

Verse 15

<b>And she cast the child:</b> From [the time] when he fainted from thirst, she began to carry him.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>An angel of God from heaven:</b> Angels that appear to people on the earth are in the image of people; it is not known that they are angels, as it is not the way of the Holy One, blessed be He, to reveal [them]. But it is known that the one that is speaking from the heaven is an angel [and not God], since he said, "because God has heard the voice of the youth"; and he did not say, "I heard."

Verse 18



Verse 19



Verse 20

<b>Archer (lit., One who draws [<i>roveh</i>] the bow):</b> One who draws is one who pulls. It is as [in], "They made him bitter and they shot (<i>robu</i>)" (Genesis 49:23); and as [in], "His archers (<i>rabav</i>) surrounded me." <b>A bow:</b> [This means] with a bow. And some say <i>roveh</i> is like, a youth. It is like, "The youths <i>rovim</i> will get their answer" (Chullin 20a); and like "the youth," is <i>ravia</i> in the Targum (Aramaic translation of the Bible). Meaning, a youth that is a master of the bow.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

<b>After these events:</b> In which Avraham was made a minister and leader, and the kings made a pact with him.
<b>God tested Avraham:</b> He brought him to a test, such that the Accuser (Satan), the prosecutor and the litigator could not say about him, "Does Avraham fear for nothing; did He not protect him and protect everything he has; and even the kings make a pact with him" - in the way that he said [it] about Iyov (Job 1:9-10). So He requested something from him that was more beloved to him than his body and his money. And [it could not be challenged] because he did not prevent it and he did not [even] argue, saying, "Did You not say to me, 'For it is through Yitzchak that your seed will be called,' and now You say to slaughter him and to burn him; and would it not be enough if he would be slaughtered by others, such that I could grind my teeth at him, that You rather tell me to kill him with my hands?" And it is since he did not think any of this at all, but rather had confidence in the commandment of the Holy One. 

Verse 2

<b>And bring him up as a burnt-offering:</b> The Holy One muted His words. So Avraham thought that He commanded him to slaughter him and to completely incinerate him. Hence he brought wood, fire and a knife with him, whereas He only commanded to bring him up on top of the altar. And from when he brought him up, he had finished and fulfilled the commandment of the Holy One. [And there is someone who explains, <i>nisa</i>, is that He raised him and lifted him and made him known to the world, how important he is. It is like, "raise up (<i>nesa</i>) over us the light of Your countenance"; and like, "And He will raise a banner (<i>nasa nes</i>)." For a banner is a big thing. This is the (correct) version.]  
<b>Which I will tell you:</b> And afterwards, He explained to him where it was; as it explains (Genesis 22:3), "which God had told him." Hence, He told him where it was. And because of that, he recognized the place from afar (Genesis 22:4), since He already explained [it] to him.

Verse 3

<b>Avraham awoke early in the morning:</b> To saddle his donkey, as he was alacritous and driven to do the will of his Maker.

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Remain here with the donkey:</b> As he did not want to bring them, so that they would not prevent him from slaughtering his son.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>God will see to the lamb for Him, my son:</b> Meaning, my son [will be the lamb for the burnt-offering]. He said to him a matter with two meanings. For he said to him, the [other] one according to his understanding - [its] meaning was like one saying, "My son, the Holy One will see to the lamb for Him." But our Rabbis say (Bereishit Rabbah 56:4) that Yitzchak understood, and nevertheless, "the two of them went together" -  with the same mind to fulfil the will of the Creator.

Verse 9



Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>And an angel of God called to him from the Heavens:</b> And even though he was speaking in the [manner] of the Divine Presence - as he said, "and you have not withheld your son [...] from Me" (Genesis 22:12), it is since in every place when the messenger of the Omnipresent would speak, it is as if the Holy One would speak. And the end shows that it was an angel - as the second time, he said (Genesis 22:16), "'I have sworn by Myself,' declares the Lord."

Verse 12

<b>Do not stretch out your hand against the lad:</b> For you have already done the commandment. As He only commanded you to bring him up, and you brought him up over the wood. 
<b>For now I know:</b> It is [God's] way to speak like the speech of people. For He knows the hearts of people from the beginning. [So this is] meaning to say, I made Myself to be as if I did not know and now I know. [This was] to make it known to all, so no prosecutor will be able to prosecute you any more.

Verse 13

<b>And he saw; and behold, a ram:</b> And he nevertheless would not have taken it, as he was afraid lest another person lost it; and he would not extend his hand [to take the property] of others. But "after it was caught in the thicket by its horns," he knew that it was a sign to him that he should take it and that it was stuck there for his sake. So he went and took it.

Verse 14

<b>The Lord will see:</b> Meaning, He will see this place and remember the deed.
<b>As it is said this day:</b> Among people when they speak about this mountain, [one] will ask [the other], "What mountain are you saying?" And he will answer that its name is, He will see. As this is what Avraham called it.  

Verse 15



Verse 16

<b>And did not withhold your only [son]:</b> You brought up your only son before Me, and you planned to reduce your seed. But I will give you, "and I shall surely increase your seed" (Genesis 22:17).

Chapter 23



Verse 1

<b> And the life of Sarah </b> It is not the [usual] way to record the deaths of women, even righteous ones, unless it is by means of a deed. For behold we find only Sarah, Rachel, and Devorah -- Rivka's wetnurse -- and Miriam on the withdrawal of the well. Sarah's death is mentioned since she makes known to us how the grave was acquired with riches (and this is one of the tests [of Avraham]). Devorah's death is mentioned to make known how the name of the place is called Alon-Bachut. Rachel's death is mentioned to teach why she is not buried in Ma'arat haMachpela. And why is it that their years are not numbered, except for Sarah? Since she is the most important of them all.

"made him trust" [?]) to Avraham "to your seed I will give this land", and said to Yitzchak that he would call him seed. For this Yitzchak trusted for himself, but he wished to be built up from Rivkah.

<b>And Midianite men passed</b> There are commentaries that the Midianites heard him screaming in the pit, and brought him up, and kidnapped him, and sold him to Yishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and made a  great profit from this since they hadn't spent anything on him. The Yishmaelites then brought him down to Egypt, and what it says at the end of the parsha, "<b>And the Midianites sold him to Egypt...</b>" (Bereishit 37:36), is that they sold him <i>in order to</i> bring him down to Egypt, and this is not just lies! For behild, it's written there "to Potifar", and further, that in that place it's difficult why he didn't reveal himself. And also, there is one who says Madanim [מדנים] and Midaynim [מדיינים], [called this] for the name of the cargo that they carry, such as in Iyov 38:31 "<b>Can you bind the cords [<i>ma'adnot</i>; מַעֲדַנּוֹת] of the Pleiades?</b>", or I Samuel 15:32 "<b>And Agag came to him in chains [<i>ma'adnot</i>; מַעֲדַנּוֹת]</b>". And sometimes the <i>ayin</i> is omitted, for it's usual to omit the letters <i>alef, chet, hey</i> and <i>ayin</i>. For example, <b>"and laid in wait [<i>vayarev</i>, וַיָּרֶב] in a valley"</b> (I Samuel 15:5), which is like <i>vaye'arev</i> ויארב. And so too is explained <b>"sitters on couches [<i>midin</i>, מִדִּין]</b>" (Shoftim 5:10), that it's like on the cargo which is bound. And all of this isn't worth anything to me, but it was one people, as I have explained, just as they call us sometimes <i>Yehudim</i> and sometimes <i>Yisra'elim</i> and sometimes <i>Yeshurun</i>. And the truth is that his brothers sold him, as he said to them "<b>that have sold me here</b>" (Bereishit 45:4), and [the merchants?] caused them to swear, as I have explained, and made from them great profit, like a man who sells his field because of its poor quality, for they would give of their own that someone would distance it from them, for in they end they hated him with a hatred.

<b>To shear his flock</b>. At the time that they sheared their flocks, they would rejoice and hold feasts, as is written of Avshalom and Naval. And when a person is joyous, their sexual urges overcome them, and so she chose shearing-time. And she did this licitly, because before the giving of the Torah all relatives could perform <i>yibum</i>, even the father of the deceased. And since Shelah hadn't performed <i>yibum</i>, it fell to Yehuda. And when the Torah was given and the law renewed [תתנה תורה ונתחדשה הלכה], that only the paternal brothers of the deceased perform <i>yibum</i>. Even so, after the giving of the Torah, it was customary [to perform <i>yibbum</i>] even for other relatives who are permitted to her, in addition to brothers, just as Bo'az did to Rut.

<b>And the Eternal was with Yosef</b> that he didn't become sullied by the non-Jews with whom he travelled. A metaphor: it's like an animal-driver who brought twelve camels loaded with jugs of wine. One of them entered the shop of a non-Jew, and the animal-driver left the eleven and entered the non-Jew's house [to pursue the stray twelfth]. [Someone] said to the animal-driver, "Why did you leave the eleven and pursue the one?" The animal-driver responded, "Those that are on the path need no guarding at all, for no-one will libate the wine they carry [making it unsuitable for Jews to drink]. But this one needs guarding, so that no non-Jew will libate its wine." And so, <b>the Eternal was with Yosef</b>, who had entered amongst the non-Jews - [this is from] Rabbi Ovadiah, may the memory of the righteous be a blessing. And so too with <b>"May the Eternal our God be with us"</b> (Malachim Alef 8:57) - since we are exiled amongst the non-Jews. הגה"ה.

<b>And recognised them</b>. Because he was searching for them, if they came because of the famine, since it's the way of the patriarchs to come to Egypt because of the famine. See for example "And there was famine in the land, and Avram descended Egyptwards" (Bereishit 12:1), and so too with Yitzchak until the Holy Blessed One said to him "Don't descend Egyptwards" (Bereishit 26:2). And they weren't looking for him and thinking he would be king! And my teachers have explained that the brothers had beards when they sold him, and now were unchanged, but Yosef didn't have a beard and had since grown one, so he looked different.
<b>And made himself strange to them</b>. He thought, if I reveal myself to them immediately, since they are embarassed to have sold their brother and pained their father, they will say to me "silence! You're already under oath not to reveal us." And he said to them "harshly" (Bereishit 42:7), "you are spies" (Bereishit 42:9)! And he pushed them off until they brought him Binyamin, and put the goblet in his pack, and told a servant to delay them. And when he saw that, under pressure, they were afraid to sin against their father, he revealed himself, for then he knew that against their will they themselves revealed that they wouldn't hold Binyamin back.

It comes to explain when the monarchy will come to him. And he said, "It should not come to your heart that you will be in poverty until the time of your monarchy, 'as the sceptre and rulership will not depart from you,' as they will always consider you great... ...
And you will legislate decreed commands upon others; meaning to say, until Shiloh comes, you will be an officer and ruler. But when Shiloh comes, you will be a king. As when the day comes for Shiloh to be destroyed, the monarchy of the House of David will sprout"; as it is written (Psalms 78:60, 67, 70), "He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh... And He rejected the tent of Joseph... And He chose David," and Jerusalem which He selected. Hence the monarchy of the House of David is dependent upon the coming of the day of Shiloh. And Jacob announced to him that he will be king then. But [even] until the coming of Shilo, he would not be in lowliness. It is however as it is written (I Chronicles 12:39) [and all of Israel] "came to Hebron to make David king..."

<b>And strike the dust of the earth and it will be as lice.</b> It seems to me that these are the black lice they call <i>pedoux</i> because it is their manner to come from the dust, while the lice they call <i>puce</i> only come from human sweat. And it was the manner of the plagues to come from their place of generation — frogs from the river, and rain and hail from the sky, and such with all of them, and accordingly these lice must generate from the dust, and maybe there were many kinds of worms and <i>pedoux</i> and other midges whose generation is from the dust.

2. ALTHOUGH IT WAS NEARER: as we found with Isaac, when he would want to go to Egypt by the way of the land of the Philistines, as it is written: "And Isaac came to Abimelech, king of the Philistines in Gerar and then the Holy One said to him: 'Do not go down to Egypt' --perhaps that he would want to go that way.
3. LEST THE PEOPLE REGRET: that they had left [Egypt].
4. WHEN THEY SEE WAR: Pharoah's war that if they would not go by the way of the Red Sea and they drowned there, they would have pursued after them on a path where there is no sea. But if they needed to fight with him on dry land, then even the Philistines would go tward them and they would have a war before them and behind them. 
5. AND RETURN: and even though the Holy One could have struck all of them dead, the Holy One wanted to increase the miracles and wonders to dry the sea and to cross the Israelites over and to drown the Egyptians.

And how high is the greatest that it can be for you all, that it is as if I carried you, that I lifted you all high on the wings of eagles that bloom above all [other birds]. And it might be said "on the wings of eagles" that the eagle carries its chicks upon its wings and they will not see anything, not from the outside or from below and not from flying from above in order that he lifts the bird above the rest of the birds and thus the Holy One made for Israel a pillar of fire before them and a cloud after them and a wall of water to their left and to their right, then they would not see anything because of the narrowness of the Mighty One.

<b>Three times a year you shall hold a festival for Me:</b> There are three times for joy in the year, so make Me a festival on the three of them, so that your joy will be for the sake of the Heavens: On the Festival of Matzot, since you went free out of Egypt on it. And on the Festival of Harvest, at the time when a person begins to reap the harvest, he is happy, as it is written: <i>They have rejoiced before You as they rejoice at the harvest, as they exult when dividing spoil</i> (Isaiah 9:2). And you should make a festival there so that the joy will be for the sake of the Heavens. And the Festival of Ingathering, when a person gathers in his grain, brings in his figs, and harvests his olives, he is then joyful. So make your Festival then, as I want to be involved in your joy. That is why it is stated about the Festival of Huts (Sukkot) in a different place: <i>and you will only be happy</i> (Deuteronomy 16:15). Meaning to say, since you have gathered everything in, you have no other thought but to rejoice.

<b>Remove the golden rings:</b> Aharon intended [it] for the sake of Heaven.

So there would be more dispute and argument among them and they would spill blood and kill people on account of this. And if I say to them, 'I will not provide a head for you,' they would make a head for themselves and the dispute would increase. And if I say, 'I will be the head for you,' it would be hard in the eyes of Moshe. [Instead,] I will keep them occupied with words until Moshe arrives; and I will make something for them that has no substance to it. And when Moshe will arrive, it will dissipate by itself." And that is what he did. And likewise, he said to them, "Remove the golden rings which are on the ears of your wives" - I don't want [any] other: He intended that the women would perhaps prevent this from them; and, that way, Moshe would arrive [first].

1. "When My glory passes." It shall be revealed to you as I grow distant from you; it will look like when a man sees his friend - l'havdil - from afar and behind. And thus said our sages (BT Yevamot 49b): Moses (i.e. Torah) said (Ex. 33:20), "Man shall not see Me and live," whereas Isaiah said (Is. 6:1), "I saw My Lord," and [the Talmud] reconciles them: [Moses sees] in clear view, [Isaiah,] in unclear [view]. -- Alternatively, "My back" (Ex. 33:23) refers to what has passed, even though there is no back of the neck comparable to human beings who leave behind them what they pass. This seems to me the point, that Moses did not see the Divine Presence at all, rather he saw the rays of His light that He radiates from a place where He has passed, comparably to the sun - l'havdil - when it sets beneath the Earth in the west, and the sun itself is no longer seen but the rays are still visible, continually [weakening] as the sun grows distant. "But My face may not be seen" (ibid.) as in the morning, when the sun itself still has not risen, but the rays are already coming, continually strengthening as the sun grows closer. That is to say, you can see the rays that remain after I have passed there. (The handwritten copyist's note appended adds:) The Targum (Aramaic translation)(Onkelos Exodus 33:23) favors this interpretation; copyist's note.
"I will place my palm." My cloud! As in "We shall lift our hearts to palms(?!) [to God in heaven]." (Lam. 3:41 - n.b. often rendered as "lift our hearts with our hands" or emended to "lift our hearts rather than our hands." The Masoretic text as formulated is opaque.) And the cloud will be before you so you don't see.

Verse 23

"I shall remove My palm and you shall see My back." Know that this is only a metaphor, for there is no back of the neck above, even among the angels, as it is written, (Ezek. 1:6) "each one had four faces," a face for each of the four directions, therefore, (Ezek. 1:9) "they did not turn when they moved, they went in the direction of [any of the four] faces." Furthermore, we may not speak of [God] thus, rather, it means to say "you shall see My back" like a man who sees a friend from behind, but can't really observe him.
"But you may not see My face" for you will not see in a clear perspective as a man who see his friend from the front and observes him well.

<b>And the Presence of God filled the <i>mishkan</i></b>. Like "And the <i>mishkan</i> was filled with the Presence of God", and so too many verses where the words are reversed, as in "For they have come under the shade of my roof-beam" (Bereishit 19:8), meaning, "Regarding this, for they have come" - and so there are many. And for the honour of Heaven the words were reversed. For if it had said "And the <i>mishkan</i> was filled with the Presence", it would mean that the presence were contained within the <i>mishkan</i> which held it. Now, where it is written "And the Presence of God filled the <i>mishkan</i>", it means that the Presence is great and the <i>mishkan</i> is contained in its midst. And so too it says "And God called to Moshe from the tent of meeting" (Vayikra 1:1) - every place where the cloud is, Moshe was unable to enter without being called, for then he was given permission to enter. And so too it says at the giving of the Torah, "And Mount Sinai was all in smoke" (Shemot 19:18), and it is written after it "And God called Moshe to the top of the mountain, and Moshe ascended" (Shemot 19:20). Our rabbis explained: for each word, there was [first] a "calling" [to Moshe] - for this is the way of the world: to call a person when one wants to speak with them, that they should know that one is speaking to them.

Leviticus



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>If a man among you brings an offering to the Lord,</b> even gentiles, as it is said: "Any man" (Leviticus 22:18), to include gentiles who take vows and freely give offerings like Israelites (Eruvin 69b; Chulin 5a, 13b), "from among you" and not all of you, to exclude: "The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination" (Proverbs 15:8). Among you (Israel) I have distinguished, but not among the nations, for even if the gentile is completely wicked, his offering is accepted, in order to draw him under the wings of the Divine Presence. <b>An offering to the Lord,</b> that his intention should be for the sake of Heaven. And our Sages explained: He should not say "To the Lord, a sin-offering", but rather "A sin-offering to the Lord", so as not to utter the Name of Heaven in vain. <b>You shall bring your offering of livestock from the herd or the flock.</b> "Livestock" includes wild animals within the general category of livestock, and it specifies "from the herd and from the flock." This constitutes a general principle followed by specifics, meaning that only what is specified is included, i.e., to say that wild animals are not offered, and one who offers them transgresses. It is like a person who instructed his servant: "Bring me only wheat," and he brought wheat and barley - he is not merely adding to his master's words, but violating them. So our Sages explained (Sifra, Vayikra Dibbura DeNedavah, Section 2, 6; Zevachim 34a). The Sifra expounds: Here we learn of the humility of the Holy One, blessed be He, that He did not burden His children except with what was readily available to them. (After the Tabernacle was set up, the Holy One arranged how His servants would serve Him in His house and commanded the order of offerings.)

<b>And its innards and its legs shall be washed.</b> "Washing" for the innards is only written for the burnt offering. This is since the sin-offering and the guilt-offering are eaten by priests, and the wellbeing-offering is eaten by its owners -- if one wants to wash it they may! But this, the burnt-offering, comes to the table of the King, and one needs to prepare it in a respectful manner. But they are burnt outside.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

"And when a person brings a grain-offering". All grain-offerings are holy of holies and a non-priest (zar) may not eat of them. And since it is the way of poor people to bring grain-offerings, it pleased the Holy Blessed One to make them (the grain-offerings) holy of holies. [This is] to show Their humility (of the Holy Blessed One), since They are a great monarch (melech gadol) and love the poor.

Chapter 3



Verse 1

And if a sacrifice of peace. Therefore it is called peace (shelamim), because from it for the altar, the portions of sacrifices (blood and fats); and from it for the priests, the breast and leg; and from it for the owners, the rest of the meat. And this is the way of peace, that everyone eats together.

<b>And that is what God meant in saying, by My close ones I will be sanctified</b>. And an explanation is that God said this in the portion of the high priest, in Parashat Emor, where it is written concerning the high priest: (Leviticus 21:11) "neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;" and it is written, "[he] shall not suffer the hair of his head to grow long, nor rend his clothes;" (Leviticus 21:10). And this is, "by My close ones I will be sanctified." God is honoured by the high priests -- who are God's close ones -- that no mourning practices are found among them. And in this is "<b>And gain glory before all the people</b>" (Leviticus 10:3); "I will be glorified." And so for the children of Aharon, although they are ordinary priests, say then, since they are anointed first, behold they are like high priests today. And it is possible to explain, "<b>this is what God meant in saying</b>" as if to say, so thinks God: I will be revenged on these, since they are My close ones, and I will be sanctified and glorified in front of all the people, since they will learn from an <i>a fortiori</i> argument about themselves. Meaning, if God is so revenged on God's close ones when they transgress, how much more so should we fear the same. And when Aharon heard that they were the close ones of God, he was silent and was comforted. And our rabbis have explained that they taught halacha in the presence of their rabbi, or they were drunk on wine, "<b>and that is what God meant in saying</b>" when it said, "I will be sanctified in My honour" (Exodus 29:43).

And from our master and teacher Eliezer of Mainz I have heard: "for they are corrupted" -- even though "their fatness is in them", the language of anointing [with oil] and fatness, as in "to anoint [למשחה] them" (Exodus 29:29). Since castrated animals are fatter than those uncastrated; even so, <b>"there is a blemish in them and they will not be accepted."</b>

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b>It shall stay seven days with its mother</b>. In case the animal is non-viable. And further -- everything which separates from a place of impurity and a place of stench needs separation before it enters into the camp of God's Presence; according to this rule is the <i>zav</i>, the <i>metzora</i>, and the <i>tamei meit</i> [all of whom have an intermediate period after the cause of their impurity ceasing before they re-enter the camp of the Jewish people].

<b>And you shall not defraud, each one their kin</b> To sell according to the worth of the land, since it will return. Although there is no concept of fraud with regard to land (cf Sifra Behar 3:1), here there is fraud, since one does not acquire land in Eretz Yisrael but rather only its products, like the verse says "For the number of years they sell to you" (Leviticus 25:15). If it had been years like the years of Eliyahu (ie of drought, cf I Kings 17:1), or blasting and mildew (cf Devarim 28:22), one would not decrease the account of the money if the redeemer came to redeem. And so too the two years that the Sages said one needs to leave the land in their hand, they need to be productive years.

<i>When Moshe would enter the Tent of Meeting: Since it stated (Leviticus 1:1), "and He spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting," and here it states, "from between the two cherubs," we learned according to the straightforward meaning that when he was outside, it appeared to him that the voice was coming from the Tent of Meeting. As there (Exodus 40:35), it is written, "And Moshe was unable to enter the Tent of Meeting." But when he was inside the Tent of Meeting, it would appear to him that the voice was coming from between the two cherubs. And this is also the way of the world: When a person is outside the house and a voice comes from the house, he does not distinguish from [where in] the house [it is coming]; but when he is in the house, he distinguishes from which place in the house. And since it spoke [here] about the inauguration of the sanctuary, we learned that the Divine Presence was in the house and the voice was coming from the house.</i>

Verse :"That which we ate in Egypt for free." Commentary :"This is said so that they would not say to them in Egypt, 'You were eating with blood,' and here you are eating manna without any blood. Therefore, they said 'freely.' Perhaps in Egypt, the Nile River was a source of drink like water for irrigation. These things were ownerless and available to all."
Verse :"Fish" Commentary :"The term 'fish' is used metaphorically, as in 'and they shall multiply' (Genesis 48:16), regarding the cucumbers and watermelons. Now it explains why they asked about these species. As for meat, there is no need to give a reason why they asked, for it is a desirable food. However, regarding these species, it explains why they asked, saying, 'We see nothing but the manna before our eyes, and we have no satisfaction with it.' This is similar to the taste of fine oil, which is refined and boiled. In the portion of Beshalach, Pharaoh said, 'It is like honeycomb dipped in honey.' This refers to when it is not cooked. Both cooked and uncooked honey are sweet and require a condiment, as is done with meat using mustard and garlic. Therefore, they asked about onions and garlic. All these things are only the evil inclination, for even regarding these matters, since they do not produce anything for eating or clothing, as it is written, 'Your garments did not wear out on you' (Deuteronomy 29:4). But a light matter, for they had silver, gold, and abundant livestock. Even something that comes down from heaven does not require seasoning, for God does not produce anything that is not perfected. And there is no pleasure in the world like the manna, and the manna descends from heaven."

And when the dew fell on the camp.                                   And in Exodus it is written, 'And the layer of dew went up, and behold, the surface of the ground was covered with a fine, flaky substance, fine as frost on the ground.' It was between two layers of dew, dew from above and dew from below, like a precious box. The intention here is to convey a little insight to make known that they were not agitated as is usual.

Verse 19

Verse: "Not one day." Commentary: "Only (bilvad)" i.e : restricted to a specific condition or circumstance. 

Verse 20

Verse: "Until it comes out from your nostrils" Commentary: "Like a strong mustard on which you requested a dipping of condiments like garlic and onions" (It implies that the taste or flavor requested is strong or intense, similar to the pungency of mustard combined with the added flavors of garlic and onions).
Verse: "For you have rejected the Lord who is among you"   Commentary: "You said that it was good for us in Egypt, if there was no good for you except the divine presence among you, it would have been enough." (despite any hardships or challenges, the presence of God among the people of Israel is the ultimate source of goodness and fulfillment)

Verse 21

Verse: "And Moses said, 'There are six hundred thousand'" Commentary: "Is there enough meat to satisfy them? If you say, 'I will rain down meat from the heavens for them,' just as you said in the case of the manna, 'I cannot bear the burden alone,' if you say, 'I will bring them herds and flocks,' would it be enough? But you said, 'I will give them meat to eat.' If the meat already exists in the world, where is it in the world that will suffice for them? Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, did not insist, for He did not say that it is impossible, but rather He asked, 'Where is it in the world?' And the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him".

Verse: "And two men remained in the camp" Commentary: "For those who claim that two men remained in the camp, it is known that God commanded seventy and Moses clarified the matter by taking six from each tribe. They said, 'We do not see the same greatness in those who were brought into the tent, and there will be no need for a lottery, nor will there be a shame for those who were left out.' Since they belittled themselves, God added greatness to their greatness. The others prophesied and then ceased, for their prophecy came from the power of Moses, but these individuals prophesied and did not cease, for their prophecy came from God." Verse: "And they are written" Commentary: "In the writings that were written there, the names of the seventy-two elders were recorded when they were designated by lots. According to some opinions, when two of the elders saw that they were chosen, they felt ashamed and did not want to take their notes. Instead, they said, 'We do not deserve that greatness; it should be given to others in our place,' and they left." Verse: "And they did not go out to the Tent" Commentary: "For the purpose of prophesying, and that's it. And they are recorded in the writings that in their notes it was written that an elder had already taken the portions."

Verse 31

Verse: "like the course of a day here and like the course of a day there" Commentary: "According to the appearance in the eyes of the group of Shalyu (Quails), it had a journey of two days and three parasangs in length and a journey of two days and three parasangs in width, like a round or square tablet. They flew one group above another group, touching but not touching, and the second group, the third, and the third, the fourth, until they were two amot (2 cubits) thick, true thickness, in the length, true thickness between the heavens and the earth. In this way, they flew until they reached the camp and covered the entire camp. The camp passed in one day, and the camp was as wide as its center, which was three parasangs, as our sages said. And so it is written that they covered the entire camp, as it is written, 'And the Shalyu (Quail) went up and covered the camp.'"
Verse: "and like the course of a day thus, around the camp." Commentary: "that it was like the course of one day, to the east and to the west, and likewise to the north and south, as my mouth speaks."


Verse 32

Verse: "Ten 'homer" Commentary: "One Homer is equal to 30 se'ah, and ten Homer is equal to 300 se'ah. They amount to 10 se'ah per day, reducing the quantity." 
Verse: "They will flatten the ground for them" Commentary: "They flattened traps for their capture because they were flying at a high altitude, and the term 'flattening' is applicable to traps, as it is written: 'A trap will be spread out within the sea upon Tzur."

Chapter 12



Verse 1


<b>Because of the Cushite woman whom he had married:</b> According to the simple meaning, they were saying, "And did Moses not find a woman from the Children of Israel to take as a wife, that he went to take [one] from the daughters of Cush, who are uncircumcised? And was it because the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke with him, that he became haughty; such that he not want to marry a woman from the daughters of Israel and sought a woman from far away? 'Did he not also speak with us,' and we married from [within] Israel, and did not become haughty about this."
<b>For he had married a Cushite woman:</b> Since we did not find in another place that Moses took a Cushite woman, the verse tells you [here] that he definitely married a Cushite woman. But they did not speak about Zipporah not being from Israel, because that had then been out of his control; since he had been a fugitive and could not go go to Egypt among the Children of Israel.

"And you shall see it [the tzitzit] and remember". That it was only made for recollection, and when you see it the mitzvah recalls and reminds you of the rest of the mitzvot. Because tzitzit are like a seal on the clothes that are made for a servant, a sign that he is serving his master. And when they see Israel remembers that they are servants to God and that it is incumbent upon them to perform all God's commandments. And the value of tzitzit is 600 in gematria, and there are eight threads and five knots [per fringe] -- behold, this is 613 like the 613 commandments. And when one sees it [the fringe], it reminds one of all the commandments, and gives God a symbol to signify that they are God's servants, and a sign on their clothing and a sign [on] their houses and they are called a "seal" on it, and tefillin on their heads and arms to signify that they are servants. For the four signs surround a person: brit milah in front of them, a mezuzah at their right, tefillin on their left, tzitzit on their clothing that are dragged on their clothing behind them as they walk.

When the Lord granted priesthood to Aaron and his sons and their descendants, after they became priests, it is known that it is written in the portion of the garments, "And for his sons you shall make tunics," but for his grandsons, He did not command.

Therefore, they waged war against the Midianites and not against the Moabites, for the Moabites were not yet filled to their limit, and their end had not come as prophesied by Balaam: "I see them, but not now; I behold them, but not near." Additionally, Moses stood with the Midianites, and his father-in-law joined them, but they did not show favoritism towards them. Furthermore, Moab acted out of concern, fearing that the Israelites might attack them, as they thought their land belonged to the Rephaim, and they were afraid that they would be overtaken.]

<b>From you</b>. 'I request nothing from you but fear and love', for all the commandments are not from you but rather from Him; if He gives you a house, make a <i>mezuzah</i> and a fence [for its flat roof]. Clothing, make fringes. Money, make of it donations. Grain and grape juice and wine, make from them priestly and other tithes. A son, circumcise him. It turns out, performance of the mitzvot is ultimately from God! There is no Arab merchant in the world who, when given 20 dinarim, doesn't give because of this to the One who has commanded regarding it half of the money or a third, and this holds for him goodness. And so too, because of the Holy Blessed One we are able to praise all that You have made and give to him, and not beg at the doors. And this is that he does not ask from us a gift, just fear and love and the intention of the heart, and thus it is written (Job 41:3): "Who has a previous claim on Me, that I should repay him? All that is under the heavens is Mine!" -- I am first to give to them, before they give to Me anything. And so said David, "what is yours has been given to you". And not only do you do a <i>mitzvah</i>, but you even receive benefit! As it is written "to your own good" (Deuteronomy 10:13). And from this verse, our rabbis saw a hint (Menachot 43b) of one hundred daily blessings, as it is written "What [mah/מה] does the Lord your God ask of you?" Do not read "what" [mah/מה], rather one hundred [me'ah/מאה] -- and there are one hundred letters in this verse from "And now", when you read "what" with the additional <i>alef</i> (making it "me'ah"), that in one hundred there are one hundred letters. For within the verse there are 99 letters, and with the <i>alef</i> there are a round 100. And now there are two [hundreds]! -- one that you read, and a further one of the 100 letters.

<b>However, there should be no needy among you.</b> If you observe the shemitah (Sabbatical year) and yovel (Jubilee year), for the needy who have sold themselves and their daughters would return in the shemitah year, and if they have a debt, it is remitted. In the yovel year, their inheritances and properties they had sold return to them, so it turns out that they cannot remain needy.
<b>For the Lord will bless you.</b> Rather, "the Lord will bless you" refers back to the previous statement, which says: "There should be no needy among you," meaning neither a borrower nor a lender. The borrower, as I have explained, and the lender: even though he remits his loans, <b>for the Lord will bless you</b> and you will not lose anything by it.
<b>In the land that the Lord your God is giving you</b> to each and every one <b>to possess it.</b> For it will not permanently pass into the possession of others, if you observe the shemitah, as he goes on to explain.

<b>And you shall be joyful</b> That in the merit of this, the Omnipresent will make you joyful. And our teachers explained (Pesachim 36b, Bikkurim 1:6) that at the time of joy - from Atzeret [Shavuot] until Chag [Sukkot] - one brings and reads. For that is the time of picking fruit, and people are joyful. From thence onwards, one brings and does not read. And a ger brings and does not read, because they cannot say "fruit of the land You gave me" (Devarim 26:10) <b>"that God swore to our ancestors"</b> (Devarim 26:3) - for they do not have a portion in the Land. And in Masechet Bikkurim (1:4) they say, Since they cannot say "to our ancestors" - and so in prayer, since in prayer our teachers relied on the Talmud Yerushalmi [Bikkurim 1:4 (2:2)] that they bring stories that gerim said in prayer "God of our ancestors". This is because "our ancestors" [אבותינו <i>avoteinu</i>] is the language of "our great ones" [גדולינו <i>gedoleinu</i>], like <b>"And He has set me as a father to Paroh and as a master to all his house"</b> (Bereishit 45:8), and so too <b>"he was the father of all those who play the lyre and the pipe"</b>  (Bereishit 4:21), which is translated (Targum Onkelos on Bereishit 4:21) "their teacher" [רבהון <i>rabhon</i>]. And so <b>"father of many nations"</b> (Bereishit 17:4) - prince and master of the whole world. And thus the geirim are accustomed to say "God of our ancestors" in prayer, and this is primary.

<b>To cause you to cross over in the covenant</b> All of you are ready to cross into the covenant, and all of you are together. And for this it's good to execute the commandment now, that not one of you is able to say: I was not in the covenant, and did not accept the covenant upon myself. Since when you will cross the Yarden and be scattered each man to his inheritance and portion, it will be impossible to gather all of you together as you are now - since it's impossible that there will be no birthing woman or sick person or person kept aaginst their will, or lame person, and it's impossible to leave the houses and cities without any creature. But now, behold all of you are in one area and one camp, and all of you hear and see the execution of the covenant, and not one of you is able to withdraw and say 'I was not in the covenant'. "Execution [lit. "cutting" כריתות] of the covenenant" since they cut the calf into two, and "to cause you to cross over" since they passed between the parts of the calf that Avraham our father did between the parts, as it says <b>"and divided them in the midst"</b> (Bereishit 15:10). And like they did when they executed the covenant to send the slaves free (Yirmiyahu 34:13), the calf which was cut into two and they passed between the parts, this is a sign that when you pass over the covenant this is how it will be cut. Like, <b>"And Shmuel took one milk-goat"</b> (I Samuel 7:9), <b>"And Tzamad took a cow and cut it into parts"</b> (I Samuel 11:7) -- to say, which will not go after Shaul and after Shmuel, so will be done to his cow.
<b>To bring you over</b> As one man. 
<b>In the covenant of GOD your God and into Their curse</b>That you will accept upon yourself the covenant and the curse - "curse" the language of oath and of curse, that you accept upon yourself to have sworn an oath and accept the commandments to keep them, and the curse which will come upon you if you do not keep; and if you keep, the blessing and the life and the peace.

<b>And you saw all the detestable things and the disgusting things of wood and stone</b> that they themselves think (are thought?) as disgusting things, that they make an idol of wood or stone. When it is new they serve it, and when it is blurred(?) they detest it and throw it into the disgusting thing [i.e. dungheap] and into the dirt of the streets. And when it does not do what they want, they curse it and degrade it, as it says <b>"and when they are hungry, they shall rage and revolt against their king and their divine beings"</b> (Yeshayahu 8:21) and when they curse others, say: O, it is like their god who is unable to help them, like <b>"By you shall Israel give-blessings"</b>... (Bereishit 48:20), and it does not say "they shall curse their king and their God".
<b>"of gold and silver that are with them"</b> When they make an image of silver and gold, after they serve it for one or two years they say: This isn't working at all, I will make another. And they break it and grind it, and there is "silver and gold that are with it", since it's expensive. And one could explain: that it itself is gold or silver, there they are with it and beside it, since they are afraid of it being stolen, since it can't guard itself even from mice. And you will see that they serve this and leave it, and serve another, and they have no authority over them, rather whoever wants worships and whoever wants leaves, everyone according to the desires of their heart. And they cleave to theft and robbery, promiscuity and incest, all that their hearts desire they do. And this is something in the heart of a person to do "the stubbornness of their heart" (ref to Devarim 29:18). And therefore you need to accept all of you the covenant, the curses and the oaths, that you will stand by the tradition of the covenant.

<b>Many evils and troubles</b> Evils which are made troubles to one another, like being stung by a hornet and a scorpion (Chagiga 5a) - cooling drugs are good for hornet stings, heating ones for scorpion stings, and the reverse is deadly. And if a hornet and a scorpion bite a person, they will be scared to come in the cold to be healed from the hornet because it's dangerous for the scorpion sting, and to come in the heat because of the horney sting, and they won't know what to do. So too the troubles of Israel in exile - when a nation oppresses them, they are scared to accept it lest they hate them, and if they don't accept it they will become accustomed to do this.
<b>Is it not because my God is not in my midst that these evils have found me?</b> since I have sinned and I have caused the Shechina to be separated from me, these troubles have come upon me.

Yosef Kara, may his memory be blessed, explained: "Gods did not know them" - regarding the Holy One, blessed be He, it is stated (Exodus 2:25), "and God knew"; "I have known its sufferings" (3:7). But [these gods] did not know their difficulties, and did not help them.
