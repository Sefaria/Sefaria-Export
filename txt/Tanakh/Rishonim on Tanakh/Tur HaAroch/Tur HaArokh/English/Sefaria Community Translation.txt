To differentiate between day and night. Rashi explains that this refers to the concealment of the initial light. However, in the seven days of creation, darkness and light alternated between day and night. And in Bereshit Rabbah, it is said that from the fourth day onward, the light of the sun and moon shone immediately. As for the phrase "like the light of seven days," it is a way of speaking in the world to express that something is kept hidden for the seven days of celebration, even if it cannot be revealed to everyone, but is only brought out during those seven days of celebration. Similarly, the light of the seven days is like the light that existed during some of those days.

Verse 22

מכל אשר בחרבה מתו. Of all that perished in the destruction. And there are no fish in the sea, even in the waters of a boiling flood.  It was possible that they fled into the abyss and into the crevices of the rocks and hid there. And how about all the people who ran away to the ocean? 

Verse 23

"and wiped out the whole existence."  After he had said, "And all flesh is afflicted, and all that died by the sword, he continued to say and wished that the body rested" and they were like the waters, and he wished for the bitter water because the waters were boiling, as our sages said, remember them as a blessing (רז"ל = "remember them as a blessing" or "Razal" edt.).
וימחו מן הארץ "...and they perished from the land." Let us forget their memory that they have no seed, even though it is already written that they all died, it was necessary to say yes to make us hear that there was not a fowl or a creeper that had eggs or seed left in any tree or under the ground because they all perished and it may be according to the verse and he wiped out the whole universe that is on the face of the earth because of man Until the beast and until the bird of the sky died from the earth and only Noah remained.

Chapter 8



Verse 1

ויזכור אלהים את נח "And God remembered Noah". According to Rashi: He (God) remembered them for sticking to their kind, etc. And the Ramban wrote: "to Noah" (את נח) that he remembered his righteousness and made a covenant with him to save him, and Noah would include his seed with him, but the remembrance of animals and beasts is not their right, that they have neither right nor punishment, except that he reminded them of his holy word that he said, and the world and his will were In the creation of the world. He (Noach) came before him (God) and (God) desired their existence and remembered to take them out so that they could not be anymore in the ark.

2 For your benefit, lest I destroy you [on account of] your stiff necks. And thus Israel [experienced] two consequences [for the golden calf incident]: The first is that God's Shechinah will not [commune] directly [among you]. The second is that [God] will send an angel before Moses [only] until he banishes the nations [from the promised land], but after they inherit the land, they will not be assured or helped even by an angel! For this reason God causes us to take not of "on the way." And regarding this it was said: "When the people heard this harsh word, they went into mourning, and none put on his finery" (Exodus 33:4)
