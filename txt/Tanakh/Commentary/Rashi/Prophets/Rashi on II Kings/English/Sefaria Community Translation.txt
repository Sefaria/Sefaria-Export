from before you, and you shall place another vessel in its place to fill it, but the jug of oil you shall not move from its place, for the Holy One, Blessed be He, is making it as a spring, and it is not customary for a spring to move from its place. I heard this Midrash Aggadah

And he did not do this, but rather to anyone who would ask, he would say, "My master sent me to revive the dead." (Tanchuma, Besalach 26, Talmud Yerushalmi, 10:2)

And he will withdraw from you and return to his land. [He will] not [return] because of the rumor, but after awhile he will return shamefacedly, and I will cause him to fall there by the sword. Now what was the rumor? (v. 9) “And he heard [a rumor] about Tirhakah.” He heard that Tirhakah had gone out to wage war against him. Consequently, he withdrew from Jerusalem and went to Cush, and waged war with Tirhakah, Put and Egypt, who were with him. He defeated him and took their most coveted treasures, and came to Jerusalem, where he fell. In reference to this, Isaiah stated (Is. 45:14), “The toil of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush… will pass by you….”

his treasure-house: [Heb. בֵּית נְכֹתוֹ] the storehouse of his spices, like (Gen. 37:25) “spices (נְכֹאת) , balm and lotus.”
 and the good oil: Some interpret this as the anointing oil (Ex. 30:22 33), and others interpret it as balsam oil, which is found in Eretz Israel, as it is said (Ezek. 27: 17), “Judah and the land of Israel, they were your merchants, with wheat of Minnith and Pannag.” 
I saw in the book of Josephon (book 4, ch. 22), Pannag is balsam, and it grows in Jericho. Because of the aroma (רֵיחַ), it is called Jericho (יְרִיחוֹ).
 there was nothing: Even the Ark, the Tablets, and the Scroll of the Law.

Others interpret בַּמִּשְׁנֶה as “outside the wall,” between the two walls, which are double [around] the city. [בַּמִּשְׁנֶה She was teaching the Oral Law to the elders of the generation.

  Jonathan rendered: the craftsmen and the sentries of the gates, [translating harash as craftsmen, as in Ex. 28:11, and masger as closing, i.e., those who close the gates.] Our Rabbis, however, said that these were great Torah scholars, that when one would open his mouth to speak, all would remain silent, as it is written (Is. 41:1), “Keep silence  before Me, O islands.” “Masger,” all would sit before him and learn from him, as it is said (Is. 22:22), “And he will open, and no one will close, and he will close, and no one will open.”

Verse 15
