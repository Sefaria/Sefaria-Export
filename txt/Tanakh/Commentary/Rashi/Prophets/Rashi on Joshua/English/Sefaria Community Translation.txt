Rashi on Joshua



Chapter 1



Verse 1

And it was after the death of Moshe: It links with the Torah that has just finished with the passing away of Moshe and there is the coupling.

Verse 2

Moshe, my servant, died: And our Rabbis explain (תמורה טז א) upon three thousand halachot which came about during the days of mourning for Moshe, Yehoshua came and asked and Hakadosh Baruch Hu said to him, Moshe my servant has died and the Torah in his name I called out and he said to him, go and lead them into war

Verse 3

Every place which your legs shall lead you:

Verse 4

From the desert of Lebanon: This is the desert of Kadesh, the desert of Tzin which to the side of Edom and was the southwestern border and the way there led to the Land. As it is said (Bamidbar 20:16) "We are in Kadesh" from which we know in the south-west. As it is said (Ibid. 34:3) "Your southern border will be in the desert of Tzin by the side of Edom
...Until the great river, the Euphrates: This is the limit from south to North
All of the Hittite land: With the same principle
And until the great sea towards the setting sun: From the west to the east.

Verse 5



Verse 6

Be strong and courageous: In the way of the land, therefore it says later: because you will allot inheritances. 

Verse 7

Only be strong and very courageous: In Torah, as it is said: To guard and to carry out the whole Torah
Have success: Succeed

Verse 8

This book of the Torah: The Torah which was in front of them. 
And you shall meditate on it: And you shall study it, [for] all meditation in the torah is in the heart, like it is said, "And let the meditation of my heart be before you (Psalms 19:15)", [and also] "May your heart meditate [on] fear (Isaiah 33:18)."

Verse 9

As I commanded you, be strong and courageous: In war, as it is said: Don't be scared or dismayed. And he had been asked to do so previously, in the days of Moshe (Devarim 31:23) "And he compelled Yehoshua Bin Nun etc"

Verse 10

And Joshua commanded: On the day that the period of crying in mourning for Moses ceased.

Verse 11

Prepare for yourself equipment- He told them to fix all the things that were needed on the path, and their vessels for warfare. For if you say [that 'equipment'] is referring to food and drink, [you are wrong because] they were given enough [food] by the manna in their vessels until the 15th of Nisan. As it says, "(Joshua 5:12) And the manna ceased the next day." (This according to Rabbi [Judah the Prince]).
In three days' time- At the end of three days. During the next three days you will be here and after that, you shall cross (the Jordan River).

She told them that no man even desired to sleep with a woman. Every nobleman and prince had visited Rahab the harlot. She was but ten years old at the time of Exodus and had practiced prostitution for the entire forty years that had elapsed since then.

Verse 15

Use of the definite article in the phrase, "She lowered them by the rope through the window" is a reference to the very same rope and window that her paramours would use to ascend to her chambers. She thus proclaimed, "Master of the Universe! By these very things I transgressed, let me now achieve absolution by them."

Verse 3

<b>And you shall carry them with you:</b> Like the commandment of Moshe (Deuteronomy 27), to build an altar for them on Mount Eval and to write the words of the Torah upon them. And on that day, they come to Mount Eval and built the altar with them and brought up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings; and they ate and drank, and peeled [the words off of] them, and came and lodged in Gilgal.

Verse 10

<b>Until the end of the whole thing:</b> As we learned in Tractate Sotah 34a - while they were still in the Jordan [River], Yehoshua said to them, "You are crossing the Jordan, in order to drive out all of the inhabitants of the land, etc."

Chapter 5



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>Flint (<i>tsurim</i>) swords:</b> [Its meaning is] like its translation [in Onkelos], "sharp knives." And so, "You have even turned the blade (<i>tsur</i>) of his sword" (Psalms 89:44) - when the sharpness is turned into [the sword's] sides and does not cut properly. And so, "Every vessel sharpened  (<i>yutsar</i>) against you" (Isaiah 54:17).
<b>a second time:</b> As a large congregation was already circumcised together on the night of their leaving Egypt; and this is the second time. As the entire forty years that they were in the wilderness, no northern wind blew upon them; and [so] there was no day that was suitable for them to circumcise, as we learned in Yevamot 71b. And our Rabbis said (Yevamot 71b), "'A second time" - this is the uncovering of the [member during] circumcision, which was not given to Avraham, our father." 

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>And this is the thing (<i>devar</i>, literally word):</b> He circumcised them through speech (<i>dibbur</i>): He said to them, "Are you thinking to inherit the land uncircumcised? Was it not said to Avraham thus, 'And you shall guard my covenant (of circumcision), etc.' (Genesis 17:9), 'And I shall give to you and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings' (Genesis 17:8)?"
<b>all the people that left:</b> There was not one of them here, as they all died. And they were circumcised, as it is stated (verse 5), "As they were circumcised."

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>And their children He raised in their place:</b> And their children that He raised in their place, those were those that were born in the wilderness, <b>those Yehoshua circumcised</b>.

Verse 8



Verse 9

I removed the disgrace of Egypt, who said" we saw that bad against your face, one star that has the name 'bad' and it is a sign of blood, we saw that it was above you in the desert , and he said to Moses in the wilderness (Exod L) Why tell Egypt, saying that the star "bad" took them out and they did not know it was the blood of circumcision and when they circumsized in the days of yehoshua, the same blood came and removed the shame that was still with the erav rav who went up with them that were counted with them. this is how r moshe explains it

Verse 10



Verse 11

<b>From the morrow of Pesach (Passover):</b> The day of the waving of the omer (barley offering), as they first offered the omer. And from the seventh of Adar when Moshe died, when the manna stopped, they were sufficing from the manna in their vessels that they had gathered on the seventh of Adar, as it is stated (Exodus 16:35), "the manna [they ate] for forty years." And was it not forty years minus thirty days? As behold, the beginning of the descending of the manna was on the fifteenth of Iyar! I will say from here that the pancakes that Israel took out from Egypt had the taste of manna.

Verse 12

Therefore, they ate from the land if they had Man they wouldn't have eaten from the grain, because the Man was comfortable for them. A parable is said about a baby who eats barley bread when there is not wheat bread. Therefore it says and there were no more. 

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>Now have I come:</b> to your aid - as no man can fight against it and seize it, to bring down its wall - but in the days of Moshe, your teacher, I came and he did not want me; as it is stated (Exodus 33:15), "If Your face does not go, etc."

Verse 15

<b>The minister of the army of the Lord:</b> [That is] Israel, which is the army of the Lord. And it was Michael, as it is stated (Daniel 10:21), "Daniel, your minister."
