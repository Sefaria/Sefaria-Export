Verse 1

This Sounding of the horn is a commandment.  If it were simply something that accompanied the offering, why would there be no mention of it on the other festivals?  Moreover, with regard to the offerings we are instructed to "sound the trumpets" (10:10) - not to sound the horn, for which a different Hebrew verb is used.
