Sforno on Leviticus



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2

אדם כי יקריב מכם, when he brings from himself close to G’d with confession of his sins and submission in the way of the verse in Hoseah 14,3 ונשלמה פרים שפתינו, “So we will offer the words of our lips instead of bulls.” And as it says in Psalms 51,19  זבחי אלוקים רוח נשברה, “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.” For he has no desire for fools who bring offerings without a (sense) of prior submission (to God), and our Sages have already said, “מכם,” from you, and not all of you, to exclude the Mumar (apostate).

Verse 14

At this point the Torah warns that one must not cause distress to one’s fellow man by undermining his dignity, his self image and the image he enjoys among his peers. Example are: לא תקלל חרש, this is a damage that the deaf person does not even become aware of. Next, the Torah discusses tangible damages, such as 
לפני עור לא תתן מכשול, indirect damages, for who knows if the blind will trip over the obstacle? The one causing even indirect damage is held responsible by the Torah. [this is presumably in the realm of heavenly judgment, seeing that the Talmud feels that people, as opposed to animals, who have eyes in their head, should watch out for obstacles in their path. Ed.]
