Chapter 1

With 32 mystical paths of Wisdom/ engraved Yah/ the Lord of Hosts/ the God of Israel/the living God/ King of the universe/ El Shaddai/ Merciful and Gracious/ High and Exalted/ Dwelling in eternity/ Whose name is Holy -/ He is lofty and holy -/ And He created His universe/ with three books (Sepharim),/ with text (Sepher)/ with numbers (Sephar)/ and with communication (Sippur)....
Ten Sefirot of Nothingness/ and 22 Foundation Letters:/ Three Mothers,/ Seven Doubles/ And twelve Elementals.
Ten Sefirot of Nothingness/ in the number of ten fingers/ five opposite five/ with a singular covenant/ precisely in the middle/ in the circumcision of the tongue/ and in the circumcision of the membrum.
Ten Sefirot of Nothingness/ ten and not nine/ ten and not eleven/ Understand with Wisdom/ Be wise with Understanding/ Examine with them/ and probe from them/ Make [each] thing stand on its essence/ And make the Creator sit on His base.
Ten Sephirot of Nothingness:/ Their measure is ten/ which have no end/ A depth of beginning/ A depth of end/ A depth of good/ A depth of evil/ A depth of above/ A depth of below/ A depth of east/ A depth of west/ A depth of north/ A depth of south/ The singular Master/ God faithful King/ dominates over them all/ from His holy dwelling/ until eternity of eternities.
Ten Sephirot of Nothingness/ Their vision is like the "appearance of lightning"/ Their limit has no end/ And His Word in them is "running and returning"/ They rush to His saying like a whirlwind/ And before His throne they prostrate themselves.
Ten Sephirot of Nothingness/ Their end is imbedded in their beginning/ and their beginning in their end/ like a flame in a burning coal/ For the Master is singular/ He has no second/ And before One, what do you count?
Ten Sephirot of Nothingness/ Bridle your mouth from speaking/ and your heart from thinking/ And if your mouth runs to speak and your heart to think/ return to the place. It is therefore written,/ "The Chayot running and returning." (Ezekiel 1:14)/ Regarding this a covenant was made.
Ten Sephirot of Nothingness:/ One is the Breath of the Living God/ Blessed and benedicted is the name/ of the Life of Worlds/ The voice of breath and speech/ And this is the Holy Breath.
Two: Breath from Breath./ With it He engraved and carved/ 22 Foundation Letters/ Three Mothers/ Seven Doubles/ and Twelve Elementals/ And one Breath is from them.
Three: Water from Breath./ With it He engraved and carved/ [22 letters from]/ chaos and void/ mire and clay/ He engraved them like a sort of garden/ He carved them like a sort of wall/ He covered them like a sort of ceiling/ [And he poured snow over them/ and it became dust/ as it is written/ "For to snow He said, 'Become earth'" (Job 37:6).]
Four: Fire from Water/ With it He engraved and carved/ the Throne of Glory/ Serafim, Ophanim, and holy Chayot/ and Ministering angels/ From these three He founded His dwelling/ as it is written:/ "He makes His angels of breaths,/ His ministers of flaming fire" (Psalms 104:4).
He chose three letters/ from among the Elementals/ [in the mystery of the three mothers/ Alef Mem Shin (אמש)]/ And He set them in His great Name/ and with them, He sealed six extremities./ Five: He sealed "above" and faced upward/ and sealed it with Yud Hey Vav (יהו)./ Six: He sealed "below" and faced downward/ and sealed it with Heh Yud Vav (היו)./ Seven: He sealed "east" and faced straight ahead/ and sealed it with Vav Yud Heh (ויה)./ Eight: He sealed "west" and faced backward/ and sealed it with  Vav Heh Yud (והי)./ Nine: He sealed "south" and faced to the right/ and sealed it with Yud Vav Heh (יוה)./ Ten: He sealed "north" and faced to the left/ and selaed it with Heh Vav Yud (הוי).
These are the Ten Sefirot of Nothingness:/ The Breath of the Living God/ Breath from Breath/ Water from Breath/ Fire from Water/ Up down east west north south.

Chapter 2

Twenty-two Foundation Letters:/ Three Mothers/ Seven Doubles/ and Twelve Elementals./ The Three Mothers are Alef Mem Shin (אמש),/ Their foundation is/ a pan of merit/ a pan of liability/ and the tongue of decree deciding between them./ [Three Mothers, Alef Mem Shin (אמש)/ Mem hums, Shin hisses/ and Aleph is the Breath of air/ deciding between them.]
Twenty-two Foundation letters:/ He engraved them, He carved them,/ He permuted them, He weighed them,/ He transformed them,/ And with them, He depicted all that was formed/ and all that would be formed.

Twenty-two Foundation Letters:/ He placed them in a circle/ like a wall with 231 Gates./ The Circle oscillates back and forth./ A sign for this is:/ There is nothing in good higher than Delight (Oneg - ענג)/ There is nothing evil lower than Plague (Nega - נגע).
How?/ He permuted them, weighed them, and transformed them,/ Alef with them all/ and all of them with Alef,/ Bet with them all/ and all of them with Bet./ They repeat in a cycle/ and exist in 231 Gates./ It comes out that all that is formed/ and all that is spoken/ emanates from one Name.
He formed substance out of chaos/ and made nonexistence into existence/ He carved great pillars from air/ that cannot be grasped./ This is a sign/ [Alef with them all, and all of them with Alef]/ He forsees, transforms and makes/ all that is formed and all that is spoken:/ one Name./ A sign for this thing:/ Twenty-two objects in a single body.

Three Mothers: AMSh (אמש)/ Air, water, and fire./ Fire is above, water is below,/ and air of Breath is the rule/ that decides between them./ And a sign of this thing/ is that fire supports water./ Mem hums, Shin hisses,/ and Alef is the breath of air/ that decides between them.
The Teli in the Universe is like a king on his throne./ The Cycle in the Year is like a king in the province./ The Heart in the Soul is like a king in war.
"Also God made one opposite the other" (Ecclesiastes 7:14)./ Good opposite evil,/ Evil opposite good./ Good from good/ Evil from evil./ Good defines evil/ And evil defines good./ Good is kept for the good ones/ And evil is kept for the evil ones.
Three:/ Each one stands alone/ one acts as advocate/ one acts as accuser/ and one decides between them./ Seven:/ Three opposite three/ and one is the rule deciding between them./ Twelve stand in war:/ Three love,/ three hate,/ three give life/ and three kill/ Three love: the heart and the ears./ Three hate: the liver, the gall, and the tongue./ Three give life: the two nostrils and the spleen./ Three kill: the two orfices and the mouth./ And God faithful King rules over them all/ from His holy habitation/ until eternity of eternities./ One on three/ three on seven/ seven on twelve,/ And all are bound, one to another.

And when Abraham our father, may he rest in peace,/ looked, saw, understood, probed,/ engraved and carved,/ He was successful in creation,/ as it is written,/ "And the souls that they made in Haran" (Genesis 12:5)./ Immediately there was revealed to him the Master of all,/ may His name be blessed forever,/ He placed him in His bosom, and kissed him on his head,/ and He called him,/ "Abraham my beloved" (Isaiah 41:8)./ He made a covenant with him/ and with his children after him forever,/ as it is written,/ "And he believed in God, and He considered/ and He considered it righteousness" (Genesis 15:6)./ He made with him a covenant/ between the ten fingers of his hands - / this is the covenant of the tongue,/ and between the ten toes of his feet - / this is the covenant of circumcision,/ And He bound the 22 letters of Torah to his tongue/ and He revealed to him His mystery/ He drew them in water,/ He flamed them with fire,/ He agitated them with Breath,/ He burned them with the seven [planets]/ He directed them with the twelve constellations.
