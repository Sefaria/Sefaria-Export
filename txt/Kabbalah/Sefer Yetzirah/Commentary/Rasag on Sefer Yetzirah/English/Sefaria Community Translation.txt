Chapter 1



Mishnah 1



Mishnah 2



Mishnah 3

<b>Ten spheres without anything, etc.:</b> Rav Saadia explained, ten spheres - as explained above - which are restrained. This means to say, restrain your mouth from speaking and your heart (mind) from pondering.
<b>Corresponding to the ten fingers of a man, five parallel to five:</b> Five toes on one foot parallel to the five toes on the other foot. And likewise the fingers of the hands are parallel, five parallel to five; with the circumcision of the nakedness between the toes of the feet; and likewise the heart and the tongue between the fingers of the hands. This is to remind a person and to warn him about the ten spheres, which he explained above are to be restrained - meaning restrain your mouth from speaking and your heart from pondering about them. And this is [the meaning of] "with the <i>milah</i> of the tongue," speech. And the [letter] <i>lamed</i> is accented - it is the expression, word. "And with the <i>milah</i> of the nakedness, the [letter] <i>lamed</i> is subdued - it is the expression, circumcision. And that is the covenant [of circumcision]. This is to remind a person and to warn him about the word of the mouth concerning the ten mentioned spheres and what was before the spheres and what will be after them. And likewise restrain your heart from pondering about them; how He created, formed and made them.
