Chapter 1

<big><strong>The Revelation of Unity and Goodness: Foundation of the Creation (Openings 1-4)</strong></big>
<i>Oneness: God’s existence, His will and control</i>
<b>The oneness of <i>Eyn Sof</i> – He who has “No End”, blessed be He – lies in the fact that only His Will exists, and no other will exists except through Him. Therefore He alone is in control and not any other will. The entire structure is built on this foundation.</b>
<i>God’s supreme unity is the foundation of faith and the root of wisdom. Accordingly, this is what must be explained first. For the entire Wisdom of Truth (חכמת האמת, </i>Chochmat HaEmet<i>, the Kabbalah) comes only to demonstrate the truth of Faith (אמונה, </i>Emunah<i>). It comes to explain how all the created realms and beings and everything that happens in the universe all emerge from the Supreme Will (הרצון העליון, </i>HaRatzon HaElyon<i>). It shows how everything is governed in the right way by the One God, blessed be He, to bring the entire cycle of creation to complete perfection in the end. The component details of this wisdom provide detailed understanding of all the laws and processes by which the universe is governed.</i>
<i>Thus the first axiom of this wisdom is that everything we see, including all created beings and all that occurs within time, is under only One Master, blessed be He. God alone makes and does all this, and He governs everything. The purpose of this wisdom is to explain the ways in which He acts to make and govern the creation. If so, the oneness of God is what we must explain first, since this is the very foundation of the creation, as will be explained. If we can understand this subject, we will have an understanding of the foundation of the creation, its root and purpose. Accordingly, it is certainly proper to explain this first.</i>
The opening proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: The oneness of Eyn Sof…</b> This introduces the subject of the supreme unity of God. <b>Part 2: The entire structure…</b> This unity is also the foundation of all the emanated realms and created beings.
<b>Part 1: The oneness of Eyn Sof…</b> You already know that we are not talking at all about God <i>in Himself</i>, namely about the essential nature of the Owner of this Will. Everything that we discuss relates only to His <i>Will</i>, which is all-powerful and unlimited. Of this we are permitted to speak, yet even here there is a limit to how far our minds can reach, as will be discussed below. Nevertheless, since we are not dealing with His Essence but with His Will, it is more permissible for us to seek understanding.
We must believe and have faith that the Supreme Emanator – blessed be He and blessed be His Name – is One alone, unified in all respects. This means that He alone exists, and only He exists of necessity: there is simply none other. And He alone controls everything. That He alone is in control is an obvious inference from the first proposition – that He alone exists. Since He alone exists, He alone is in control. This means that every other being that exists now is contingent upon Him.
Nevertheless, the fact that He alone is in control is a separate item of faith. Otherwise the unbelievers might say that at first He may have been alone and that He chose to bring creatures into being. But they could argue that, nevertheless, as soon as He created independent creatures possessing their own will, it would be possible (were it not for the fact of His perfect unity) for these independent wills to set limits to His will. In other words, once He gave them free will, they became able to choose the opposite of His will.
Moreover, the course of the history of the world makes it appear outwardly as if this is indeed the case. For He created the universe for good, but He created the Other Side (סטרא אחרא, <i>Sitra Achra</i>), which is evil, and He created man with free will, giving him the potential to do evil. Man chose to do evil, with the result that God’s desire was not accomplished. The unbelievers argue that now that the people of Israel have sinned, there is no salvation for them (God forbid) for they sinned and continue to sin. Accordingly they will always remain exiled and persecuted – for where could their salvation come from? Indeed it says explicitly: “For Jerusalem is ruined and Judah has fallen because their tongues and their doings are <i>against God</i>, to provoke the eyes of His glory” (Isaiah 3:8). It also says: “You forgot (or <i>weakened</i>) the Rock that gave birth to you” (Deuteronomy 32:18).
Accordingly we need to know that not only does God alone exist, but also that God alone is in control. This is what is meant by the oneness of his Will: that nothing in the world could ever negate His will, for He alone is in control.
Everything we see that appears to be contrary to His will exists only because He allows it in accordance with His deep plan, which will continue unfolding until He brings everything to complete perfection. At present God leaves man with freedom of choice for as long as He wills. But in the end – whether through repentance or by means of punishment – everything will return to complete perfection. This is called “the oneness of Eyn Sof, blessed be He”. We are talking about the oneness of His Will (but not about Eyn Sof in His intrinsic Essence).
Thus <b>…only His Will…</b> – the Will of the Emanator, the unified Eyn Sof, blessed be His Name –<b> …exists…</b> because only God exists of necessity. In other words, just as we must believe in the oneness of God’s existence – that God alone exists of necessity – so we must believe in the oneness of His power and will. Just as His existence is necessary, and it cannot be otherwise – and He alone is the necessary cause, while everything else derives from Him – so too, His will and power are necessary, and it cannot be otherwise. His power alone holds sway, and all other wills exist only in accordance with this Will. Thus <b>…no other will exists except through Him</b>.
Accordingly you cannot argue that, “While it may be true that all wills exist through Him, now that they exist, they have the power to defy His will” (God forbid). This is not true. <b>Therefore He alone is in control and not any other will.</b> In other words, only He is in <i>complete</i> control, for nothing can limit His power. This power belongs to the Supreme Will, which can truthfully be said to be the one and only Will. God wills according to His Will, and nothing can limit Him. No other will is in complete control, for all other wills are contingent upon the Supreme Will and therefore subordinate to it. Accordingly, even though they are also wills, they are not in the same category as the Supreme Will. For it cannot be denied that they derive from it, and therefore they cannot be equal to it, even though they are called “wills”. As soon as we say they <i>derive</i> from the Supreme Will, we imply that, unlike the Supreme Will, they are not in complete control.
Thus when we say that there is one Emanator, blessed be His Name, Who is oneness and unity in all respects, we must immediately understand that His power is also all one. Since it is impossible for two powers both to be in complete control, we must say that only one Will is in complete control, and all others are not in control. It is still legitimate to say that now, other beings exist besides the First Existent. For this does not negate the power of the First Existent. He exists and He creates, and these other beings exist only through Him. However, if we were to argue that an absolute will exists besides the Supreme Will, even while conceding that the existence of these other wills is not necessary and that they derive from the Supreme Will, this would be a denial of the absolute power of the Supreme Will. For it is impossible to say that two powers can both be in complete control. If we say that the first absolute power made another absolute power, neither the original power nor the new one are in complete control. Accordingly, when we say that the First Emanator alone has power, it is inconceivable that there is any other absolute power.
Accordingly, when we say the universe has One God, which means one absolute Ruler and Controller, it is inconceivable that there is any other absolute power. For if there were, there would no longer be one Ruler but as many as the number of independent wills that had been brought into being, and then none of them could truly be called “Ruler”. In that case it would be impossible to relate everything to one root – as we must – except in the past. We could say that at first there was one root, but now we could no longer relate everything to a single root, because we would be saying that a being exists who has the power to limit the initial Ruler. And if you object that if the initial Ruler wills it to be so, this is not called limiting the initial Ruler, the answer to this objection will be given in Opening 2.
<b>Part 2: The entire structure is built on this foundation…</b> namely on the oneness and unity that we have explained.
<b>The entire structure</b> refers to all that was brought into existence by God, including both the lights (אורות, <i>Orot</i>, the Sefirot) and the separate realms and beings (נמצאים נפרדים, <i>nimtza’im nifradim</i>, the worlds and creatures that derive from and are governed by the Sefirot). This entire structure is founded on unity, in the sense that it is a single, complete entity that manifests the truth of this oneness and unity in the parts of the structure itself. The lights (Sefirot) that may be seen in it, the “bodies” (the created realms and beings) that exist in it, how they are governed and all that happens to them – all were made as parts of a single order which points to and actively reveals the underlying oneness.

Chapter 2

<i>His desire is only to bestow good. Even evil is a means through which He bestows good. In this way His oneness is clearly revealed.</i>
<b>The will of the Emanator, blessed be His Name, is only good, and therefore nothing will endure except His goodness. All that is initially evil does not arise from another domain that could endure against Him. In the end it will certainly be good, and then it will be revealed that there is no domain other than His.</b>
<i>This is the answer to the objection posed above: If the Supreme Will wanted to bring into being powers capable of setting limits to His power (as if such a thing were possible) – this would not be contrary to the Supreme Will, since He willed it so.</i>
<b>The will of the Emanator, blessed be His Name, is only good…</b> We cannot say that the Supreme Will desired the existence of other wills with the power to limit Him in any way whatever. For the Supreme Will wants only good, and it would certainly not be good if His goodness could not reach His creatures. If you say that such is the nature of goodness – to benefit the righteous and punish the wicked, while “showing compassion for the wicked is cruel” – the Torah says the opposite: “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious” (Exodus 33:19) – “even though he may not be worthy” (<i>Berachot</i> 7a). It is also written that, “The sin of Israel will be sought but it will not exist, and the transgression of Judah will not be found” (Jeremiah 50:20). From here we see that it is God’s will to benefit even the wicked.
If you argue that all this applies only <i>after</i> the long exile and punishment – this is precisely what proves the point. For if so, we see that the Supreme Will ensures that eventually everyone benefits. From this we may infer that His will is only to benefit, quite literally. However, He has to deal with each one suitably according to his nature. It is necessary to punish the wicked in order to forgive them afterwards. If the intention was to reject the wicked, they should literally be destroyed instead of being punished in order to benefit them afterwards. The fact that they are punished to benefit them later is clear proof that His will is only for good. For the intended result of an action is the ultimate purpose that governs all parts of that action. In the end, all men, whether righteous or wicked, receive goodness. If so, the ultimate purpose is to bestow goodness on all. This proves that His will is only for good.
<b>And therefore nothing will endure except His goodness. </b>Seeing that His will is only to benefit, it must be that the present state will not continue endlessly. Granted, if He did not spurn the destruction of the wicked, we could have said that their punishment is not bad, but rather that, “Evil pursues sinners” (Proverbs 13:21) and their punishment is fair retribution, as discussed above. However, now that we have said this is not His way, but that he punishes the sinner in order to bring him to repent so as to benefit him, the punishment itself is bad. As such, it cannot continue forever. It must come to an end so that the sinner may be released. Since the punishment is bad, it is against the Supreme Will. And just as it cannot continue forever in each individual case, so it cannot continue forever in the world as a whole, for it is against the Supreme Will.
Let me now demonstrate conclusively that evil must come to an end in the world as a whole. For the intended result of any action is the ultimate purpose that governs all parts of that action. Now the end result of the complete cycle through which all people pass, including even the wicked, is good. If so, good is the ultimate purpose of the complete cycle in all its parts. Thus we have proof that the ultimate purpose of the entire cycle is good. But it is the Supreme Will that brings about the entire cycle. Since the ultimate purpose of the cycle is good, the whole purpose of the Supreme Will must also be only good. Thus we have proof that the entire purpose of the Supreme Will is only good.
Now let us consider whether the punishment which the wicked suffer before the end is good or not. When something ends up being different from what it was in the beginning, its beginning and end are not in the same category. The end of the cycle through which the wicked pass is different from what it was at the beginning. For in the end they attain good, while before the end, they suffer punishment. If so, the beginning and end of the cycle are not in the same category. The end is good – and this was the original intention of the Will that brings about the entire cycle. However, the intermediate stage or means – the punishment, which comes <i>before</i> the end – is not in the same category as the end. If so, that which comes before the end is not good: it is <i>not</i> what was initially desired by the Will that brings about the cycle. If we object: Then why does it exist? The answer is that it is not possible to attain the end without it. If it were possible to attain the end without this means, it would not be fitting for this intermediary to exist.
We may conclude from all this that the punishment is bad, and it is the opposite of what is desired and intended by the Supreme Will. However, it exists as a necessary means through which His creatures attain the end goal. If it were possible to attain the end goal without this means, it would have been better, given that His will is for good. Just as inflicting punishment in individual cases is the opposite of His will – which is why it must eventually come to an end – so too we may infer that punishment in general in the running of the world is also against the Supreme Will, and must change in the end.
Since the Supreme Will planned that all the individual components of creation will ultimately attain good, it must be His purpose to bring the entire world to attain only good in the end. Just as He created punishments sufficient to bring each individual to receive good in the end, so He has the power to create a kind of punishment, or whatever else it may be, for the entire world, that is evil at first but ends up being good. It is certainly true that His will is only for good, and this is what must endure forever. For His power is forever and only His will holds sway. If the means to accomplish this end is through evil, this does not undermine His intention to benefit everyone, for evil is the means to eventual good. On the contrary, His good purpose will eventually be revealed and the intended result will endure forever. For what comes out of the entire cycle on every side is only His essential goodness.
<b>All that is initially evil does not arise from another domain that could endure against Him. </b>Now that we understand that what He does must ultimately be good, we must understand another truth. This is that there is certainly only one domain, contrary to the claim of the unbelievers that there are two domains. When we say that our God is one, it is necessary to understand two things. The first is that even though we see such a multitude of diverse phenomena in the universe and so many different and opposing causal chains, we know that even so, there is only One God, blessed be His Name, and only one Will. The second thing that follows from saying that God is one is that no other will can limit Him, even one brought into being by Him. And it is certainly impossible that two powers or realms exist, one creating good and the other creating evil. “HaShem our God, HaShem is One” – with every kind of oneness and unity.
If at the present time it appears as if events occur through a power other than God, be it a power that He created or another “independent” power, it is not so. God alone in His intrinsic goodness brings everything about. We have already discussed how everything evil that now exists will not endure forever. In the end, everything will be good, and we will know and retroactively understand that there never was any other power or domain. For an independent power or domain must by definition endure forever. This is obvious, for any power is independent only to the extent that nothing else has power over it. An independent power or domain is one that exists in and of itself. Whatever does not endure cannot be said to be an independent power or domain. Once we understand this, we see that no will – not even one that He brought into being – can limit Him. On the contrary, the purpose of the entire cycle is to reveal His dominion afterwards and to perfect all things through His goodness. This is what we must believe with perfect faith.
The benefit of studying the wisdom of the Kabbalah is that we can come to know and understand this clearly. We have been commanded to do so: “And you shall know this day and bring it into your heart, that HaShem is God in the heavens above and on the earth below: there is none other” (Deuteronomy 4:39). And how will we understand this? When we understand how the entire cycle of the universe is governed from beginning to end, we will then see clearly how it is that everything comes only from God, blessed be His Name. The purpose of everything is that only His good desire to benefit will endure forever, and nothing else. The very things that today perplex us and cause the wicked to stumble into heresy will in the end reveal this truth to us, showing us His true, unique oneness in all its ways.
From this discussion we may clarify two aspects of the evil that apparently exists in the world now. The first is that it does not emerge from another domain or power (God forbid) that could exist against Him. The second is that in the end it will be good. <b>In the end it will certainly be good…</b> for it cannot stand against His goodness, not even in the sense explained earlier whereby a will that He brought into being might limit Him. In the end, it will be good.
Moreover, it is precisely in this way that Eyn Sof makes known to us His true oneness. <b>And then it will be revealed that there is no other domain but His.</b> Had He simply given His creatures an immediate understanding of His perfection, they might recognize His complete perfection (inasmuch as He revealed it to them) and understand His great majesty and glory. But this would not have refuted the doctrine of the unbelievers in earlier generations that it is impossible to understand a thing except from its opposite. They argued that if we say there is one God who is the ultimate good, there must (God forbid) be another who is the ultimate evil. For if it were not so, there could be no knowledge of the ultimate good.
In order to refute this claim, God willed and created evil, as it is written, “making peace and creating evil” (Isaiah 45:7). In this way, the opposite is immediately manifest, and then it is possible to understand the side of good. Moreover, we will also know that even this evil was not an independent domain in its own right. Only the omnipotent God, blessed be His Name, has the power to bring about what appears to be His very opposite. And through this we will see His great perfection.
Evil is not an independent domain God forbid. It is created by God in order for His creatures to see what is the opposite of good, so that they will not think that there is some other opposite. For the only opposite is that which is actually the opposite. And when they have seen the opposite, and have also seen that it is nothing but His creation, they will have clear knowledge of His perfection and oneness. Then the folly of the wicked and the unbelievers will be exposed. For in the created realms, it is indeed the case that one side can only be known through its opposite. But the way of the Creator is not the way of His creatures at all. For a creature cannot make the opposite of himself. But He made His opposite, and then He negates it – and His oneness is revealed to perfection!

Chapter 3

<i>The ultimate goal of creation – to bestow the ultimate good on God’s creatures</i>
<b>The ultimate purpose of the creation of the world was for God, in accordance with His good desire, to bestow the ultimate good.</b>
<i>Having explained the meaning of faith in God, we will now discuss His works.</i>
<b>The ultimate purpose of the creation of the world…</b> For clearly, every actor acts for a purpose <b>…was for God… to bestow…</b> not for His own need, since He has no need for His creatures, but in order to benefit His creatures <b>…in accordance with His good desire. </b>In other words, if you ask, “Where did this purpose originate?” the answer is clear: That which is good desires to bestow good. The Supreme Will is the ultimate good. If so, His desire is to bestow good – <b>the ultimate good,</b> because He is the ultimate good, and therefore His desire is to bestow the ultimate good. This is why He made the world in this way, with free will, reward and punishment. For this is the means to bring His creatures to the ultimate good, as will be explained in the next Opening.

Chapter 4

<i>His desire to bestow good to perfection through the revelation of His oneness is the cause of the deficiencies in the world, which create the conditions for man’s service. The revelation of His oneness is itself the reward.</i>
<b>The Eyn Sof, blessed be He, wanted to bestow complete good, so that its recipients will not even be ashamed. He planned and calculated how to reveal His perfect oneness in actuality, for before Him there are no barriers or deficiencies. Accordingly, He established the system of government that He follows, in which eventually evil actually turns back into good. Initially, He gave a place for evil to do what is in its power, but at the end of everything, all the damage is repaired and all evil turns back into actual good. And thus His oneness is revealed, and this itself is the delight of the souls.</b>
The proposition consists of four parts: <b>Part 1: The Eyn Sof, blessed be He...</b> This is the underlying principle of the order that was instituted to serve the ultimate purpose as discussed in the previous Opening. <b>Part 2: He planned and calculated how to reveal... </b>This is the plan that lies behind this order. <b>Part 3: Initially, He gave a place...</b> This discusses how evil reverts to good. <b>Part 4: And thus His oneness is revealed... </b> This tells us what comes at the end of the cycle.
<b>Part 1:</b> <b>The Eyn Sof, blessed be He, wanted to bestow complete good...</b> As explained earlier, He wanted to bestow good to the utmost degree of goodness and perfection <b>…so that its recipients will not even be ashamed. </b>For, as the rabbis stated, “One who eats what is not his, feels ashamed to look in the face of his benefactor” (<i>Yerushalmi</i>, <i>Orlah</i> 1:3). In order to avoid this, He wanted that people should have a way of working in order thereby to <i>earn</i> the good which they then receive as their reward. Accordingly He created good and evil and gave man free will, placing him in a situation of reward and punishment until the intended goal is achieved.
<b>Part 2: He planned and calculated how to reveal His perfect oneness in actuality...</b> For the actual method of man’s service also had to be fitting and not merely arbitrary. For clearly, whatever commandments He instituted would all have been to men’s merit when duly performed by them, and they would receive a reward for all of them. But true to His exalted wisdom, the Master of the World wanted that the method of service, rather than being merely arbitrary, should itself be a single system, consistent in all its parts and constructed according to a deep plan. He wanted one root for the entire system. The Supreme Will calculated that there could be no more fitting and logical focus for man’s service than if He were to reveal His oneness in actuality. This would provide a suitable area in which man could serve, and the revelation of God would itself be the benefit man would receive, as will be discussed below.
<b>For before Him there are no barriers or deficiencies.</b> His unique perfection surely lies in His total and absolute power. No possible barrier or deficiency can stand in His way. This we will come to know from the side of God’s perfection, not from the opposite side. For this is revealed only when it is not the deficiencies and the repair that comes to them through the power of His perfection that are seen, but rather when only His perfection is seen. This was a suitable area within which service could exist. His plan to reveal His oneness in actuality consisted of first revealing the deficiencies, and then rectifying them, thus revealing His oneness and His power over everything.
When perfection holds sway, there is certainly no need for service at all, for nothing could be better than His complete perfection. If so, fulfillment of the commandments would not add anything to it, or to His government of the world. But in a situation in which deficiencies exist, fulfillment of the commandments is of benefit, because through them, that which is imperfect and deficient is able to attain perfection. If so, only a realm of deficiency provides the appropriate arena for service in this way. Service is very applicable in a realm of deficiency. For it is impossible to speak of oneness and unity without speaking of absolute power and control without any limits. It follows that if He desires to actually reveal this unity, He will create a limitation and then remove it.
Here we have the concept of the “center” of Eyn Sof mentioned in Kabbalistic literature (<i>Etz Chayim, Derushey Igulim VeYosher</i> 11:3), where the Tzimtzum (“contraction”) took place. This “center” is the central “point” on the basis of which the worlds and the service within them were created. The act by which they came about was the concealment of perfection, which left a realm governed by the principle of imperfection, a realm in which service is relevant. However, what He wanted to reveal is how the realm of deficiencies becomes rectified through the power of His oneness. If so, the work is not complete unless perfection is initially concealed, to make it possible for deficiencies to exist. In this phase, the possibility of service exists – until the perfection of His oneness and unity is revealed and He rectifies all the deficiencies.
Indeed the service itself includes the actual revelation of His oneness, for it is the people who serve who draw down and reveal this unity so as to rectify all that is lacking. And now see what is their reward: it is the very unity, which will be revealed to them, and they will attain it. This itself is the perfect goodness that He wants to bestow on them. For the reward for the fulfillment of the commandments is only in the world to come, when the souls come to their root, which is the root of the entire creation. Their delight will be according to their level of attainment. When they attain the revelation of God’s unity, their delight will be perfect in every way: no barriers will stand in the way of the recipients, and they will attain the light of perfect unity – the greatest possible delight the souls can enjoy.
To summarize: When Eyn Sof, in His perfect wisdom, wanted to institute a system of service, He calculated in what arena it would be applicable. He knew that there was no aspect of His perfection in which there was any need at all for His creatures or any place for their service except in the bestowal of good, whereby evil itself reverts into good. This is the fundamental concept of perfect unity about which I wrote. In God’s aspect of complete perfection, there is no place whatever for service. However, because the very concept of oneness and unity involves the hypothetical possibility of imperfection (not that it exists, but that it is negated through the power of perfection) it was therefore pertinent that in order to reveal His goodness, He should conceal His perfection – in order then to reveal it in actuality. This is like “damaging in order to repair”. On this foundation He did all His work: He made a place for independent beings and a place for their service, and fixed a very precious reward for them.
<b>Part 3: Accordingly He established the system of government that He follows...</b> namely, the system of government that exists now <b>…in which eventually evil actually turns back into good.</b> In this way, what existed within His unity in potential becomes revealed in actuality, in that… <b>Initially, He gave a place for evil to do what is in its power</b> – He concealed His perfection – <b>but at the end of everything, all the damage is repaired and all evil turns back into actual good</b> – quite literally, and this is the end of the cycle through which His oneness is revealed.
<b>Part 4: And thus His oneness is revealed.</b> Several things are involved here. First, His oneness itself is actually revealed. Since this involves evil reverting into good, it could not actually come about until evil was actually revealed in the lower realms. Secondly, the revelation of God’s oneness is so precious that His creatures will have the greatest delight when they attain it. Thirdly, this revelation, which involves initial concealment, provides a place for service and, when attained, for reward. Since evil exists only during the phase of service to reveal His oneness, the service does not need to last forever. “ ‘Today to do them’ – and tomorrow to receive their reward” (<i>Eruvin</i> 22a on Deut. 7:11). For as soon as His oneness is revealed, there is no further need for service, because <b>…this itself is the delight of the souls:</b> the revelation of His unity is itself precisely the goodness that, as we have said, He wants to bestow.
Thus we see how the Supreme Will calculated and planned something intrinsically perfect and logical in all its parts. The goodness which He bestows is in itself complete: it is very great and precious, for His oneness is something most glorious and precious. Further, the mode of bestowal is also perfect, because the recipients will not feel any shame, having worked to earn their reward through service. Moreover, it is the actual bestowal of good itself that creates the possibility of service. For it is the way in which the intended bestowal of goodness comes about that provides a place for man’s service. The purpose of the service is to reveal God’s unity, which is the intended benefit, which comes about through turning evil back to good.
Thus the complete path of government in its perfection involves the initial concealment of His perfection followed by its revelation. This very pathway is what creates the possibility of service. The entire creation and the system through which it is governed are built on this foundation. Thus the system through which the world is governed is a law that will eventually reveal, through all its cycles, the truth of this oneness. And the creation itself is built on the foundation of concealment followed by revelation – in the sense that the created realms and beings themselves contain allusions to the laws of this system of government. This is what was stated in Opening 1: “On this foundation the entire structure is built”.

Chapter 5

<big><strong>The Sefirot (Openings 5-6)</strong></big>
<i>The Sefirot were an innovation in that they are visible lights, whereas Eyn Sof is not visible.</i>
<b>The Sefirot are lights that were permitted to be seen, which is not so in the case of the simple light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He.</b>
<i>The subject of all the investigations of the Kabbalah is the Sefirot. Therefore this is what must be explained first.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The Sefirot are lights…</b>This tells us what the Sefirot <i>are</i>. <b>Part 2: …which is not so in the case of the simple light. </b>This tells us in what way the Sefirot are different in their nature from Eyn Sof. For in order to understand the Sefirot, it is necessary to understand in what way they were an innovation introduced for the sake of the creation: this is explained in Part 1. Initially, however, there was only Eyn Sof, blessed be He. If so, in order to know the Sefirot, it is necessary to know in what way they differ from their original state, and from Eyn Sof.
<b>Part 1: The Sefirot are lights.</b> It is through the Sefirot that Godliness “unfolds” or “extends”. We cannot refer to the unfolding or extension (התפשטות, <i>hitpashtut</i>) of Godliness as anything but a radiation of light (הארה, <i>he’arah</i>). For the truth is that Godliness does not “extend”, since the concepts of “extension” and “change” are not applicable to God. However, we call the radiance that spreads from Him the “unfolding” or revelation of Godliness, and accordingly we say that the Sefirot are radiations of light.
Indeed we cannot call Godliness anything other than a radiation of light. In truth, no word, name or term can adequately be applied to Godliness. But since it is impossible to speak without words, we must call it by some name. However, we choose one that is somewhat less remote from Godliness than others. Light is the finest and most subtle of all physical phenomena, and accordingly it is less remote from Godliness than other phenomena. If so, the term “radiation of light” is the nearest we can choose. Even so, you must understand that we are not talking about a radiation of physical light. We are applying the term “radiation of light” only to give it some name.
<b>…that were permitted to be seen.</b> For the difference between the Sefirot and Eyn Sof, blessed be He, is that it was made possible for the Sefirot to be “seen” (in the sense of being spiritually apprehended). This means two things. Firstly, it means that the Sefirot are <i>capable</i> of being seen, though this does not imply that the Sefirot must necessarily be visible, for indeed there are exalted Sefirot that are not visible even in the higher realms. What is implied is that they are <i>fit and able </i>to be seen. Should it happen that the spectator is prevented from seeing them, this does not detract from their nature of being potentially visible. However, the light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, cannot be seen at all because of its intrinsic essence, which is unseeable.
Secondly, in saying that the Sefirot were <i>permitted</i> to be seen, we are not saying that they were intrinsically visible. The light of the Sefirot is not a particular kind of light that is visible in its intrinsic nature, as opposed to the light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, which is not. What changed in the act of creation was that the Sefirot <i>became</i> visible. It became possible for them to be seen because Eyn Sof wanted it so. If the light of the Sefirot was a particular kind of light that was visible in its intrinsic nature, we would have to say that the Sefirot were not an innovation. For what exists in something as part of its intrinsic nature is found in it throughout its existence. If the ability of the Sefirot to be seen were part of their intrinsic nature, then as long as the light of the Sefirot existed, it would have to be visible. What we must say is that the light of the Sefirot cannot have been new, but that the <i>revelation</i> of this light – the ability of the Sefirot to be <i>seen</i> – is what was new.
This is because the Sefirot are Godliness. Change from state to state is simply not applicable to Godliness. If so, the light of the Sefirot is not something new. The inference is that the light of the Sefirot was there from before. If the visibility of this light were part of its intrinsic nature, it would always have been visible. In that case, what was new? What was new was that God willed and made it possible for the light of the Sefirot to be seen. He gave this permission at precisely the moment He wished, not before. The change was not in the nature of Godliness. The change was in its being revealed to recipients.
From this you can understand why it is so appropriate to refer to the Sefirot as “emanated light” (אור נאצל, <i>ohr ne’etzal</i>). For on the level of what the (spiritual) eye can see, light was emanated to our eyes – a light that could be seen. This was not the case at first. And if permission were granted to the eye to see, we would come to recognize that everything has one root: Eyn Sof, Who cannot be seen. There is one light that exists through Him on a level such that it <i>can</i> be seen, and this is the light of the Sefirot. If so, let us call it a light that emanated from <i>Ayin</i> (אין) – from “No-thing”, i.e. from that which cannot be conceived.
<b>Part 2: …which is not so in the case of the simple light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He.</b> The “simple light” is that which simply cannot be described, defined or categorized in any way. It is impossible to say anything about His light. Since there is no word or name fit to be applied to Eyn Sof, blessed be He, we will refer to Him in the only way that we can, using the expression “simple light”. However, we qualify this by negating any limitation that may appear to be implied in Him on account of the term we have chosen. For in truth, no such limitation is intended. Thus we say that the light of Eyn Sof<i> </i>cannot be seen. This is the difference between Eyn Sof, blessed be He, and the Sefirot.

Chapter 6

<i>The Sefirot are what Eyn Sof wanted to reveal of His attributes.</i>
<b>Each Sefirah is one of the attributes of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, with which He created the worlds and with which He governs them. Since He wanted that they should be known, He made each attribute appear as an individual light, through seeing which one may understand that attribute. When one sees the movements of that light, one understands the influence of the corresponding attribute on the government of the worlds at that time.</b>
<i>Having learned that the Sefirot are lights or radiations, we must now understand what these radiations are.</i>
This proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: Each Sefirah is one of the attributes...</b> This explains what is visible. <b>Part 2: Since He wanted that they should be known...</b> This explains how that which is visible is perceived.
<b>Part 1: Each Sefirah is one of the attributes...</b> Each attribute (מדה, <i>middah</i>, a “measure”, “quality” or “trait”) is one part of His will, namely one of His powers. We may understand this by analogy. The body is composed of many different limbs, and someone who sees the body sees these limbs. On the other hand, the parts of the soul are not limbs but powers: these powers are the various faculties of the soul, such as memory, imagination and feeling. Someone who “sees” them (with spiritual vision) sees a variety of different powers. Similarly, when one sees what it is possible to see of the Supreme Will, what he sees are the powers of that Will. <b>Each Sefirah is <i>one</i> of the attributes</b> – <i>one</i> in the sense of being unique and separate. It is the revelation of His powers as separate attributes that distinguishes God’s chosen way of acting through the Sefirot from His intrinsic omnipotence, in which He brings everything about through his unitary, all-encompassing power.
For a given cause cannot give rise to any and every effect, but only to the particular effect that can arise from it. The reason is that the cause in question has only the particular power that it possesses, and can give only what it has. When a person carries out a variety of activities, we necessarily differentiate between the various powers that he possesses, which enable him to carry out these different activities. But God is <i>all</i>-powerful, and we therefore cannot ascribe to Him any specific, limited power. This is because God’s power is general and all-encompassing. God can do everything. For this reason we cannot divide God’s powers into a multiplicity of specific powers as the causes of His various works.
Nevertheless, in His revealed way of acting through the Sefirot, Eyn Sof chose to act in a way similar to the way in which a person acts, using a variety of different powers and abilities. This is what is meant by the statement of the rabbis that “The world was created with ten sayings... yet surely, it could have been created with only one!?!” (Avot 5:1). Accordingly, we differentiate a specific, separate cause corresponding to every manifest work or action.
<b>…of the attributes of Eyn Sof, blessed be He…</b> This indicates that the Sefirah is not a mere derivative that is caused by, outside of and secondary to Eyn Sof. For His Will is a single unity. In its intrinsic limitlessness, His will is invisible, and this is what we call Eyn Sof. Those aspects of this Will that are revealed we call the Sefirot, but the Will itself is Eyn Sof – limitless and indefinable. This is why we say that the Sefirot are the <i>attributes</i> of Eyn Sof.
One could object: Surely we are saying that Eyn Sof is the root, while the Sefirot derive from and are caused by Him, in which case they are secondary to Him. If so, how can we say here that the Sefirot are not derivative and secondary? To answer this, it is necessary to understand in what sense the Sefirot are derivative and in what sense they are not. The Sefirot are not derivative in the sense of being a new, separate phenomenon caused by Eyn Sof which did not exist in Him from the outset and does not exist in Him now, like separate bodies. For if that were the case, the Sefirot would indeed be truly merely secondary. But in fact, the Sefirot are parts of His totality – the parts that He reveals.
However, when we compare the different levels, we say that the actual root revealed in and through the Sefirot is none other than Eyn Sof Himself. Even though intrinsically Eyn Sof is not revealed, He reveals to us what He wants. Accordingly, prior to the revelation of the Sefirot, they were subsumed under the name Eyn Sof, just like all the other powers encompassed within His limitless Will. However, when these attributes were revealed, they were no longer called Eyn Sof, for now they have an end and a limit, as mentioned above. Accordingly, they are called Sefirot, from the Hebrew root ספר (<i>SaFaR</i>) meaning to count or number, indicating that they have a measure and a limit.
<b>…with which He created the worlds...</b> In other words, why should these attributes have been revealed and not others? Because these revealed powers relate to the lower realms, since it was through these powers that He created them <b>...and rules them...</b> For even though the work of creation is complete, the supervision of the lights over their branches has not ceased, and the Sefirot continue to function as at first.
<b>Part 2: Since He wanted that they should be known…</b> This too was contingent upon His Will. For although these powers existed within Him, it was not intrinsically necessary that they should be able to be perceived and apprehended, except that He wanted it so.
<b>He made each attribute appear as an individual light.</b> This means that a specific likeness was instituted for each attribute (such as the likeness of a lion for Chessed, Kindness) in order to make it possible to gain an understanding of the governmental power expressed in this attribute through the corresponding image or likeness, as will be discussed later.
<b>...through seeing which one may understand that attribute...</b> This is as stated by Rambam (Maimonides): “At the very time when the prophet sees the prophetic vision, its meaning is inscribed in his heart” (<i>Yesodey HaTorah</i> 7:3).This additional point is very necessary. If the Sefirot shone each in its own particular way because of its intrinsic essence, the prophets should certainly have been able to understand the meaning of what they saw. However, since each Sefirah shines in its unique way only because God willed it so, something else was necessary in order for the prophet to be able to understand what was symbolized in the prophetic image – namely, that its meaning should be inscribed in his heart when he saw it. Accordingly, together with his vision of the Sefirot, the prophet is provided with the key to the interpretation of the vision and can thus understand the meaning of these lights in all their detailed aspects.
In this way – <b>Seeing the movements of that light enables one to understand the influence of the corresponding attribute on the government of the worlds at that time.</b> For just as the government of the worlds shifts from kindness to justice or mercy according to the time, so movements are visible in the Sefirot according to the time, and when the prophet sees them, he understands what they mean. All of the various powers involved in the government of the worlds change according to the time. Not only may the overall government shift between kindness and judgment. There are also changes in each of the individual attributes according to the time, and these are expressed in the movements of the lights. This is visible because of the desire of the Supreme Will to reveal to His creatures how He governs the world.

Chapter 7

<big><strong>The Forms in which the Sefirot appear (Openings 7-13)</strong></big>
<i>How the Sefirot appear in the prophetic vision. The images seen by the prophets and what they represent.</i>
<b>The Sefirot can shine with an abundant radiation of light or with diminished radiation. They can appear in numerous different forms and likenesses, although in truth they possess no form or appearance. It is just that they appear in some form or likeness, but one who examines them will see that in truth, the form and likeness are purely contingent upon the observer, as stated in the verse, “And in the hand of the prophets I have used likenesses” (Hosea 12:11). In their essence, however, the Sefirot are only an extended array of powers organized in their necessary order, interdependent in their various laws and influenced by one another, as required according to the perfection of the entire ordered plan.</b>
<i>Having explained that the powers (</i>Sefirot<i>) with which God created and governs the worlds appear by way of radiation, we will now explain the principles governing how this radiation appears.</i>
The proposition consists of three parts. <b>Part 1: The Sefirot:</b> This refers to the amount of radiation emitted by the Sefirot. <b>Part 2: They can appear...</b> This refers to the images or likenesses through which they appear. <b>Part 3: But in themselves...</b> This is a general comment on all the images and likenesses through which they appear.
<b>Part 1: The Sefirot can shine with an abundant radiation of light or with diminished radiation.</b> What this means is as follows: Since the Supreme Will wanted to display His simple powers by way of light, the revelation may be lesser or greater, since one light may shine only a little, whereas another may shine more powerfully. And this is what we see: Sefirot and Partzufim. As Sefirot, they shine with little light, but as Partzufim, they shine with abundant light (see below, Opening 17 on Sefirot and Partzufim). When they shine as Partzufim, more details are revealed; as Sefirot, fewer parts are seen. So too there are variations in terms of the power and influence of individual Sefirot. Sometimes a Sefirah may shine with little light and little power (during the period of exile): this is known as “smallness” (קטנות, <i>katnut</i>, “smallness”, also “childhood”). At other times the Sefirah may shine with great power (after the redemption): this is known as “greatness” or “maturity” (גדלות<i>gadlut</i>).
<b>Part 2: They can appear in numerous different forms and likenesses:</b> Many of the terms used in discussing the Sefirot have connotations of form and material substance. However, we certainly cannot say that the Sefirot themselves actually possess any kind of form or substance, for this would be heresy, and the Torah states explicitly: “For you did not see any form” (Deuteronomy 4:15).
As discussed earlier, the Sefirot are the powers of the Supreme Thought, and are “seen” (with spiritual vision) by the prophets or souls in a way comparable to the way a person “sees” the thoughts passing through his mind. Nevertheless, there is a great difference. For a person’s mind and thoughts are within him and are not Godly. Accordingly there is nothing to prevent us applying concepts of “form”, “likeness” and “appearance” of some subtle kind to the thoughts in a person’s mind, except that the form would be spiritual rather than physical. This is not so in the case of the Sefirot, which are the powers of the Thought (or “Mind”) of the Supreme Will, blessed be He. It is impossible to say that they possess any form at all, since we know that in all His aspects, the Emanator, blessed be His Name, completely transcends all the incidents and events that occur to those He created.
Nevertheless, we do speak in terms of “smallness” and “greatness”, “ascent” and “descent”, “clothing”, “position” and so on in relation to the Sefirot. We certainly cannot say that any of these phenomena exist as such in the Sefirot. Yet it is impossible to say that all such concepts are purely metaphorical, hinting at exalted matters involved in the government of the worlds and its laws. For if it were so, most of the investigations of the Kabbalah would be pointless since they would be like trying to base what we know (the metaphors) on what we don’t know (the Sefirot). This is not what is indicated by the teachings of the ARI, the earlier and later Kabbalistic sages, and, above all, those of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai. All these teachings indicate that these phenomena actually do exist in the Sefirot. Here is the place to clarify the truth, for if this foundation is laid properly, everything will be understood properly, clearly and simply. But if this foundation is not laid properly, all the structures will remain flying in the air and it will be impossible to attain any understanding whatever of the investigations of the Kabbalah.
The truth is that all the Sefirot are powers of the Supreme Mind. They all operate to bring about what is necessary in the world, all leading to one goal: the final, ultimate perfection, as explained above. These powers contain everything necessary for the government of the entire world at all times. For example, the power of Chessed, Kindness, includes all the ways in which it must act in the worlds, sometimes holding sway, sometimes yielding its dominion, sometimes dominating strongly, at others, more gently. At times the power of Chessed operates in conjunction with Gevurah, Strength, in various different ways, whether in a revealed or hidden manner. Likewise, the powers of Din, Judgment, and Rachamim, Mercy, also contain everything necessary for the government of the entire world at all times.
All of the three root powers of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy contain everything necessary for reward and punishment (Judgment), the existence of the world (Mercy) and the eternal reward (perfect Kindness). The Supreme Mind calculated in advance everything necessary for the government of all His creatures until the end of the entire cycle. Everything is a single weave of these three powers including all the different kinds of controls, laws and pathways necessary and sufficient to bring about everything that must come into being in the world.
This entire composite weave is visible to the prophets or the souls, and this is what is called the Chariot (מרכבה, <i>Merkavah</i>). The actual powers of the Supreme Thought are invisible, for they are simple and cannot be seen in their intrinsic essence. Yet the Supreme Will wanted them to be visible through lights and prophetic likenesses and images, and to appear in all the different aspects that we ascribe to them: Partzufim, worlds, one clothed in another, ascending, descending, and so on. However, we already know that this is not how these powers are in reality: this is only how they appear in the prophetic imagination.
Thus it says explicitly: “And through the hand of the prophets I have used likenesses”. This means that God conceals the profundity of His thoughts within these prophetic images and metaphors. But the truth is that this is only how the prophets see them, and even this “seeing” is not like physical seeing, as will be discussed below. What the prophets see are spiritual phenomena that take the form of “clothing”, “ascent”, “descent” and the like. However, this “seeing” is nothing but a prophetic vision made up of likenesses and images conveying the depth and breadth of the plan in the divine mind. We may conclude that Kabbalisitic teachings are not merely metaphorical. The phenomena we have mentioned, such as “ascent”, “descent”, “clothing” and the like, truly exist in the prophetic vision. However, the prophetic vision itself is only a <i>likeness</i>. The prophets have the special power of being able to see the vision <i>and</i> understand its meaning.
The subject of the prophetic vision is God’s deep plan. When He wanted to reveal it, He showed it in the form of the “Chariot”. The various parts of this Chariot have all been given their own individual names: these are the names of the Sefirot and the Partzufim, and the prophetic visions show all their different states and properties.
In an actual prophetic vision, the Sefirot and Partzufim may appear in many different forms and interrelationships, as we find in Kabbalistic writings about the various worlds and Partzufim etc.
<b>...although in truth they have no form or appearance.</b> This is clear in the light of what we have explained above. <b>It is just that they appear in some form or likeness.</b> What this means is that prophetic likenesses and images are not mere metaphors and allusions: this is the way the prophet actually sees what he sees. What we say about the Partzufim is actually the way they are seen in the Chariot.
<b>But one who examines them will see that in truth, the form and likeness are purely contingent upon the observer.</b> This principle is expressed in the verse, “To whom then will you liken Me that I should be equal? says the Holy One” (Isaiah 40:25). What this means is that the prophets are not left with the illusion that this is the way it actually is, God forbid. As I have already said, the prophet sees the vision, likeness or image and understands the hidden level. When he attains his prophecy, he sees clearly that the picture in his vision is a likeness contingent upon the observer and not an integral aspect of the essence of that which is observed. The prophet himself understands this at the very time of the prophetic vision, as it says: “To whom, then, will you liken God and what likeness will you compare to Him?” (Isaiah 40:18).
Thus Moses warned Israel: “And guard your souls very much, for you did not see any form on the day that HaShem your God spoke to you at Horeb from out of the fire” (Deuteronomy 4:15). They were warned not to allow what they saw to cause them to err. They were to know that the entire vision was only prophetic, as they understood at the very time they saw it. Similarly, the rabbis said: “Since He was revealed to them at the sea as mighty (= Zeir Anpin), whereas at the Giving of the Torah He appeared in His attribute of kindness (= Arich Anpin), the verse states, ‘I am HaShem your God’, so as not to leave room to say there are two domains…” (<i>Mechilta, </i>Exodus 20:2).  This was so that they should not fall into error because of what they saw in the vision but that they should understand the underlying truth of what they saw in the proper way.
<b>…as stated in the verse, “ And in the hand of the prophets I have used likenesses” (Hosea 12:11):</b> The meaning of the phrase, “In the <i>hand</i> of the prophets” is that the image (the “likeness”) is formed in the mind of the prophets but is not integral to the Sefirot themselves. Each sees on his own level of perception and attainment, and the image is formed in his mind accordingly. Thus the Kabbalists said that “the <i>hand</i> of the prophets” refers to the attribute of Malchut (kingship, rule and control), which includes the power to form images.
<b>Part 3: In their essence, however, the Sefirot are only an extended array of powers…</b> As explained earlier, everything is one deep plan, a composite weave of just so many powers ordered in such a way that each holds sway only at its own designated time and in its own specific manner. This is called “an extended array of powers”. This array of powers “extends” and “spreads” in the sense that they are revealed in a variety of different ways according to specific, fixed rules.
They are <b>…organized in their necessary order...</b> This indicates that the order does not consist of scattered, separate, unrelated parts, but that a single, general, all-encompassing order underlies the revelation of each of the different powers, for everything was calculated in such a way as to lead to the ultimate goal.
They are <b>…interdependent in their various laws...</b> This indicates that the reason why we see states in which one power is clothed and garbed in another is because these powers are truly interdependent in the way they rule and function, in the sense that the functioning of one of them results from the functioning of others. In this way the Supreme Mind created a weave from which emerge all the different phenomena we see revealed in the world.
<b>...and influenced by one another...</b> In other words, the various chains of cause and effect and states of expanded consciousness discussed in the Kabbalah are bound up with the mutual influence of the various powers and laws on each other <b>…as required according to the perfection of the entire ordered plan.</b> For as we have explained, all these pathways were calculated in accordance with the overall goal of bringing the entire creation to perfection.

Chapter 8

<i>The Sefirot may appear in opposite likenesses even simultaneously. Both are true representations.</i>
<b>The Sefirot can appear in likenesses that may even be mutually contradictory, in exactly the same way as images in a dream may change in a single moment. Each likeness seen in the prophetic vision provides knowledge about one power and one attribute. The attributes and powers become known according to the true, proper order in which they are arranged and function, while the likenesses are in accordance with the soul’s ability to receive.</b>
<i>Having explained how the Sefirot appear as likenesses or images, we will now explain how these images may change from one to another.</i>
The proposition consists of three parts. <b>Part 1: The Sefirot can appear...</b> This explains how the images change. <b>Part 2: Each likeness seen...</b> This explains the utility of these changes. <b>Part 3: The attributes and powers...</b> This explains the difference between the images and what they represent.
<b>Part 1: The Sefirot can appear in likenesses that may even be mutually contradictory...</b> If the likenesses through which the Sefirot appear were intrinsic to the Sefirot themselves, it would obviously be impossible to attribute two contradictory likenesses to one and the same subject. However, since these likenesses are not intrinsic to the Sefirot but were chosen by God, there is no difficulty in the fact that they may appear in different and contradictory likenesses, one after the other, or even simultaneously. For at one moment the Supreme Will wants them to appear in one way, and the next in a different way.
This enables us to resolve a problem arising out of various passages in the writings of the ARI that appear to contradict one another. Particularly difficult is the use of apparently contradictory terms to describe the state of the worlds. One of the hardest problems is the apparent contradiction between the depiction of the worlds in the form of a series of concentric circles (<i>igulim</i>) and their depiction in a straight, upright form (<i>yosher</i>). In the circular likeness, the world of Asiyah is in the middle, and accordingly, the line (Kav) should pass through the center of Asiyah and continue downwards. But for various reasons, this is impossible (as  discussed by all the Kabbalistic masters). These problems can be resolved if we understand that these are simply the likenesses and images of prophetic vision. It is perfectly possible for the prophetic vision to contain contradictory images. The best way to understand this is by considering the parallel case of dreams.
<b>...in exactly the same way as images in a dream may change in a single moment.</b> In the case of a dream, it is not the actual object represented in the dream that is seen but rather, an <i>image</i> or likeness of the object manufactured by the image-making faculty of the mind – the imagination. It is this image that the dreamer sees in his mind, and through it, he gains the knowledge which the dream was sent to reveal, be it true or false. The person’s image-making faculty creates a picture in his mind consisting of dream images and symbols corresponding to the knowledge revealed through the dream. The picture is such that the dreamer thinks he is actually seeing the objects themselves.
However, what the person sees in the dream is nothing but the product of his imagination, and accordingly, the laws that would apply to the actual objects if they were seen by the physical eye in waking life do not apply to the images seen in the dream. The dreamer may dream that he sees a certain thing, yet that very thing may turn into something else in the same dream. These changes do not occur in such a way that the person can actually see the transition from one to another in the way the physical eye would see the transition if it took place in front of the person. In the dream, the person sees what he sees in one way, then afterwards he sees it in a different way. You cannot object that it was not that way a moment ago, for this is simply the way the imagination works.
Similarly in the case of the prophetic vision, it is possible to see contradictory images. The person may see one thing, but when he looks at it again in order to understand it, it changes into something else. Thus in Ezekiel’s vision, “the living creatures were <i>running</i> and <i>returning</i>” (Ezekiel 1:14).
When one looks at the totality of all the worlds with the line (Kav) within them, the circles appear one inside the other and the line goes down through the middle, continuing all the way to the end (i.e. down to the lower half of the circles of Atik). In this view Asiyah appears to be in the middle. However, when one goes on to examine the line, Asiyah appears to be at the <i>end</i> of the line (as if the line does <i>not</i> continue past the center, down to the lower half of the circle of Atik). If one attempts to view Asiyah in the circular and linear view simultaneously, it appears to be above and below at one and the same time – “above”, in the sense of being in the center of the circles, “below” in the sense of being at the end of the line.
A similar example from this world would be what the rabbis said about Moses’ burial place: to those standing below, it would appear as if it were above, but to those above, it would appear as if it were below (<i>Sotah</i> 14a).
The same principle applies in all the exalted visions of prophecy. They may take all kinds of different forms and change literally from moment to moment, as in a dream – for all these phenomena are found in dreams. Similarly, many other apparent contradictions in the writings of the ARI are not really contradictions at all. For in truth, what the prophet sees appears in both ways even at one and the same time, as in the case of a dream.
<b>Part 2: Each likeness seen in the prophetic vision provides knowledge about one power...</b> Not for nothing do the images change. On the contrary, when two different visions of one and the same subject are seen, it is understood that both provide knowledge about the subject in question, and the prophet who sees the vision understands its meaning. From each image the prophet attains knowledge of a separate aspect of the general power that he sees <b>...and one attribute,</b> i.e., he comes to understand things in detail. When there are many different aspects, one likeness will provide knowledge about one attribute and everything dependent upon it and deriving from it in the overall scheme of government. Another likeness will provide knowledge about a different attribute and all that depends on it and derives from it.
For example, when examining the developmental chain (השתלשלות, <i>hishtalshelut</i>) through which the various Partzufim are related, Yesod of Atik appears to end in the chest (Tiferet) of Arich Anpin, and from there forces of Kindness and Severity emerge, as will be discussed in its place (Opening 110). However, when we examine the Partzufim from the point of view of how one is clothed in another (הלבשה, <i>halbashah</i>), Yesod of Atik appears to end in Yesod of Arich Anpin. It appears in both ways because both are true. These matters are revealed through the visions of the prophets.
<b>Part 3: The attributes and powers become known according to the true, proper order in which they are arranged and function...</b> The difference between the vision seen by the prophet and the <i>meaning</i> of the vision, namely the underlying reality understood from it, is that the vision is in accordance with what the soul can receive. The Emanator, blessed be His Name, laid down the law that the prophets or the souls can receive only through this vision. Accordingly, the understanding that they need of all the different aspects of God’s attributes and His government comes to them through their visions, which follow the established laws governing the prophetic vision.
The vision changes according to the subject so as to make it possible for the souls to attain knowledge of each aspect in turn. Even though different visions may not be consistent with one another, this is of no import. On the contrary, the soul sees both visions, gaining knowledge of the two different aspects just as they are. The soul attains knowledge of God’s powers and attributes according to their true essence and their place in the scheme of government. Yet the soul attains this knowledge in a way commensurate with its ability to receive. This is the meaning of the concluding words of the proposition: <b>…while the likenesses are in accordance with the soul’s ability to receive.</b> For only in this way and no other is it possible for the soul to attain knowledge.

Chapter 9

<i>The form in which the Sefirot appear is spiritual, yet even this is not part of their intrinsic essence but only the form in which they appear when seen through the “looking glass” of Malchut.</i>
<b>Although the Sefirot appear in the form of likenesses, even so, the form seen is not like a physical form. What is seen is something that is understood as if one saw that form in the lower world. This is called the vision of the soul, whose vision is not like the vision of the body. Accordingly, the subjects of the prophetic vision do not necessarily appear in the same way as the corresponding physical objects would appear to the physical eye. What is seen by the soul is a shining light that is understood as a circle (<i>igul</i>) if what is seen is “circular”, or as a straight line (<i>yosher</i>) if what is seen in the vision is “straight”. The same applies to all the other forms or images seen by the soul: it is not that the actual physical form is seen. Even the spiritual form that is seen is not of the intrinsic essence of the Sefirot themselves, but only the way they appear through Malchut, which shows these powers in this way.</b>
<i>Having explained the forms in which the Sefirot appear, we will now explain how even this vision is not a vision of a physical form.</i>
The proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: Although the Sefirot...</b> The forms in which the Sefirot appear are not like physical forms. <b>Part 2: Even the spiritual form that is seen...</b> Even this subtle form is not intrinsic to the Sefirot but was purposely chosen.
<b>Part 1: Although the Sefirot appear as forms and likenesses, even so, the form that appears is not like a physical form.</b> Thus Moses said to the Children of Israel, “For you did not see any form” (Deuteronomy 4:15). For it is certainly impossible that the Supreme Glory could appear even symbolically in any physical form or likeness whatever. For even the soul has no physical form whatever, let alone the Supreme Glory. It is therefore not possible that the physical form of a lion or an ox or a man or a circle or a straight line would appear in the upper realm. Thus it is written: “But you saw no form, only a voice” (<i>ibid.</i> 4:12). The vision we are talking about is the vision of the soul, which means understanding rather than vision in the physical sense. The soul does not see what it sees as external physical forms. Rather, the prophet’s soul gains insight into the true spiritual essence of what he “sees”, after which his intellect forms a mental picture or image of it. If one could see into the prophet’s soul, one would see that subtle mental or spiritual picture there.
If you say that the intellect forms a mental picture of something seen by the soul in some physical form (e.g. an actual circle), it is not so. What the soul sees are the powers of the spiritual realm arranged in a certain order that is expressed in the form in which the soul sees them. (For example, the soul may have a perception of God’s overall, general providence – as opposed to His individual providence over the details of creation – and “translate” this perception into the form of a “circle”.) Thus the Sefirot are seen as lights arranged in a spiritual order which is understood as having the form of circles (<i>igulim</i>) or as having a straight, upright form (<i>yosher</i>). The Sefirot may “break through” or “ascend” or “descend” in various ways. Not that this is the actual form it takes, but this is how we can understand it.
Thus – <b>What is seen is something that is understood <i>as if</i> one could see that form in the lower world. This is called the vision of the soul, whose vision is not like the vision of the body.</b> In other words, the soul itself understands what it sees. The vision of the soul itself is not like the vision of the physical eyes – for God’s glory cannot be seen by the physical eye. Accordingly it need not be pictured other than in forms appropriate and relevant to the vision of the soul that beholds it, and the soul sees things as they actually are, not some external physical form.
<b>Accordingly the subjects of the prophetic vision do not necessarily appear in the same way as the corresponding physical objects would appear to the physical eye. What is seen by the soul is a shining light that is understood as a circle (<i>igul</i>) if what is seen is “circular”, or as a straight line (<i>yosher</i>) if what is seen in the vision is “straight”. The same applies to all the other forms or images seen by the soul: it is not that the physical form itself is seen.</b>
<b>Part 2: Even the spiritual form that is seen is not of the intrinsic essence of the Sefirot themselves...</b> For the creations are of two kinds, physical and spiritual, and each have their own respective forms. But the Supreme Glory does not intrinsically possess either of these two kinds of forms. It may, however, appear through such forms, though not in a physical form, which is gross, but in a spiritual form, which is fine and subtle. It “appears” or is “seen” in the same way that thoughts “appear” or are “seen” in the mind.
Even what is seen is not the actual divine powers themselves. This is obvious. For whoever wants to know these powers in their intrinsic essence would have to know Godliness in its intrinsic essence, because the Sefirot are pure Godliness. Since the essence of Godliness cannot be known at all, it is also impossible to know the essence of the Sefirot. Whatever is known of the Sefirot is only because it is permitted to see them in this way, not because they are this way intrinsically. What is known of them is this spiritual form. This spiritual form is not their intrinsic essence but only the form in which they are permitted to be seen.
The form in which they are seen is <b>...only the way they appear through Malchut, which shows these powers in this way.</b> These powers constitute the order through which the creation is governed. The Supreme Will not only wanted that should this be the order governing the lower creations – these being the governed – but also that the order of government should be able to be seen in and through the lower creations themselves. The created realms and their inhabitants were designed in such a way as to show and illustrate God’s system of government in the very form they take. There are just as many creations as there are parts of the system of government. Thus each of the individual powers which constitute the overall system of government produces a creation that emerges from it and which provides a visual cognate of that power in its very form and structure, qualities and attributes.
There must be something in between that channels the laws of government in such a way that they are visible and manifest in the created realms themselves, causing different powers to appear in the form of an “ear”, a “mouth”, an “apple”, “water”, “silver” and so on. There certainly must be a light that has the power to translate and express the system of government through imagery in this way.
All this comes about through the attribute of Malchut, to which allusion is made in the verse: “And he beholds the <i>likeness</i> of God” (Numbers 12:8). Malchut is called “the likeness of God” because this is the attribute that produces the spiritual forms or likenesses in which the Sefirot appear. The attribute of Malchut is the root of all the lower realms and the source of their whole existence, and it is through the attribute of Malchut that the laws of God’s government are seen in the forms taken by the bodies of the creations in the lower realms. But there on the level of Malchut itself, the form is spiritual, because everything descends gradually, level by level. The spiritual form is inscribed in the attribute of Malchut, and it is from there the material form later emerges.
Human beings do not have the power to apprehend the supernal lights except in the way in which those lights relate to themselves in the lower realms, inasmuch as the supernal lights are the roots of the forms found in the lower realms and thereby relate to them. Thus we humans can perceive the Sefirot only through the lens of Malchut, which shows the supernal lights and their mode of government through imagery. Accordingly, “…let him that glories glory in <i>this</i> (Hebrew, זאת, <i>zot</i>), that he understands and knows Me” (Jeremiah 9:23). Here the word “this” alludes to the attribute of Malchut, for only in this way is it possible to attain any perception at all, as will be discussed further below.

Chapter 10

<i>How the Emanator operates through the Sefirot – through chains of cause and effect, and by clothing one power in another. How these appear in prophecy.</i>
<b>The works of the Emanator, blessed be His Name, which He brings about through the Sefirot in accordance with the law He chose for them, are interdependent. Things emerge as consequences of one another. One thing is concealed within another, in the sense that one power may be acting in a hidden manner while outwardly it appears as if a different power is acting, yet the truth is that the manifest power acts only in accordance with the power concealed within it. Therefore the Sefirot are seen taking all these forms and likenesses, appearing in the form of lights clothed within lights, or as lights emerging from other lights. All these forms and likenesses are what the soul sees when looking at the Sefirot. From seeing them, the soul gains an understanding of these phenomena on the spiritual plane, just as we gain knowledge of physical phenomena through the vision of the physical eye.</b>
<i>Having discussed in general terms the subject of the forms and likenesses in which the Sefirot appear, we will now enter into further details.</i>
The propostion has two parts. <b>Part 1: The works of the Emanator...</b> This discusses how the lights governing the creation are interconnected. <b>Part 2: Therefore the Sefirot are seen...</b> This explains the way this interconnectivity appears in the prophetic vision.
<b>Part 1: The works of the Emanator, blessed be His Name...</b> Clearly, the Sefirot are not to be identified with the works of the Emanator, blessed be His Name, in creating and governing the worlds. Rather, the Sefirot are the <i>thoughts</i> that underlie these works, while the creations and the way they are governed are the <i>works</i> arising out of these thoughts.
<b>…which He brings about through the Sefirot in accordance with the law He chose for them...</b> When God acts through the Sefirot, it is not in accordance with His intrinsic omnipotence, whereby He can do everything in one command without the need to separate and differentiate between the various stages. When He chose to act through the Sefirot, He organized His powers in an orderly system, as stated in <i>Brit Menuchah</i> (a 15th century Kabbalistic text by Rabbi Abraham of Grenada). In other words, He chose to act little by little and to think about each thing individually. Not that He Himself has any need of this. He chose to act in this way because this is the way in which man can gain a modicum of understanding of God’s ways and His works.
The Sefirot of which we speak are parts of the interconnected order in which the Supreme Will organized His creative activity, similar to the way in which a person thinks his thoughts little by little and carries them out stage by stage. This being the case, it is possible for us to understand how many powers are involved in each individual act: which was first, which came afterwards, how it acted, and so on. It would have been completely impossible to talk in such terms if Eyn Sof, blessed be He, had wanted to act in His omnipotence. His acting little by little is like a person who knows how to read a complete word all at once yet chooses to read each letter individually in the way that children do.
<b>...are interdependent:</b> Thus when we speak of lights, we can distinguish which are roots and which are branches. We speak of Zeir Anpin and Nukva being “governed” by Imma, or of Abba and Imma being “crowned” or “encompassed” by Mazal. We are able to speak in such terms because the Emanator, blessed be His Name, chose to order His powers in this manner, and He instituted that one power should be dependent upon another. This is similar to man, who is made up of many different parts, all of which he needs and all of which are interdependent. For example, man’s faculty of speech depends upon his ability to think, for one who does not think does not speak.
<b>Things emerge as consequences of one another:</b> This refers to the concept of the chain of development (השתלשלות, <i>hishtalshelut</i>) mentioned in Kabbalistic writings. Likewise, the various powers of the soul of the individual are also organized as a system in which one is bound up with another. Thus memory is a product of thought and the ability to recognize similarities. All the different powers of the soul are likewise interdependent. When we come to the details of how God governs the world with kindness, judgment and compassion, we will gain a clearer understanding of how things are bound together in a developmental chain. An example of this interconnectivity may be found in the various traits of the human psyche, such as mercy, anger, love, hatred, desire and the like. Just as all these traits of the psyche are interconnected, emerging one from another, so too we speak of similar interconnections between the Partzufim.
<b>One thing is concealed within another...</b> This refers to the concept of “clothing” (הלבשה, <i>halbashah</i>) discussed in the Kabbalah. This phenomenon is perfectly evident as it manifests itself in man’s soul. For example, when a father chastises his son, love is the active power, for the father does what he does only because he loves his son. Yet while love is the active power on the hidden plane, our eyes see only the father’s surface anger or hatred, because he puts on an outer face of rage. There are many similar examples. But sometimes what is inside and what appears on the surface are not opposites. It is just that what is hidden may be a deep thought which the owner does not want to reveal, and accordingly he outwardly acts in a different way, and this is all that is revealed to those who see him.
<b>...in the sense that one power may be acting in a hidden manner while outwardly it appears as if a different power is acting, yet the truth is that the manifest power acts only in accordance with the power concealed within it.</b> The meaning of this should be clear in the light of what we have said above.
<b>Part 2: Therefore the Sefirot are seen taking all these forms and likenesses...</b> In other words, the forms and likenesses in which the prophet sees the Sefirot – interdependent, clothed one in another, and so on – appear on the spiritual plane in a way similar to the way the corresponding phenomena appear in the physical realm. This is because these very phenomena in the upper realms are the root of the corresponding phenomena in the lower worlds and are therefore automatically related to them, as will be discussed later.
<b>...appearing in the form of lights clothed within lights, or as lights emerging from other lights.</b> Here we have the two concepts I mentioned above: “clothing”  and “the developmental chain”. A third kind of interrelationship, in which one power depends upon another (in the way that Abba and Imma are “crowned” or “encompassed” by Mazal), is more understandable after we grasp the other two.
<b>All these forms and likenesses are what the soul sees when looking at the Sefirot. From seeing them, the soul gains an understanding of these phenomena on the spiritual plane, just as we gain knowledge of physical phenomena through the vision of the physical eye.</b> Accordingly, we speak in terms of the soul “seeing” just as the eye sees. The soul and the physical eye each possess their own characteristic faculty of vision. (For example, there is the circle that the physical eye sees, and there is the circle “seen”, “conceived” or understood by the mind.)

Chapter 11

<i>The images of prophecy derive from Malchut, and only through the lens of Malchut can we understand what is above it and what is below it.</i>
<b>The ability of the Sefirot to be represented in the images and likenesses of prophecy derives from the Sefirah of Malchut, which is the root of the lower realms. It is through Malchut that all are made in the form in which they are made. Accordingly, the Kabbalistic sages said it is impossible to ascend or receive except through Malchut. Even the very forms of the images themselves provide knowledge of the wisdom with which the worlds are governed. For through them, we can know how the Shechinah (God’s Indwelling Presence) needs to govern for the sake of the matter (represented in a given image) and to bring it down to the level of the lower realms. From and through Malchut, it is possible to gain knowledge of the levels above it, these being the actual powers and attributes of God’s government (i.e. the Sefirot themselves, as opposed to the images through which these powers and attributes appear when seen through the lens of Malchut).</b>
<i>Following our discussion of prophetic likenesses and images, we will now explain the benefit they provide.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: The ability of the Sefirot...</b> This explains where the images of prophecy are rooted. <b>Part 2: Even the very images and likenesses themselves...</b> This explains the benefit we gain from them.
<b>Part 1: The ability of the Sefirot to be represented in the images and likenesses of prophecy derives from the Sefirah of Malchut...</b> For each Sefirah has its own particular, unique power, and that unique power influences all the other Sefirot. The ability to represent the other Sefirot through the images and likenesses of prophecy is the unique power of Malchut.
<b>...which is the root of the lower realms.</b> And for this reason, the beginning of form and likeness is found on the level of Malchut, which contains the very root of form and likeness. Accordingly, Malchut itself appears in the prophetic vision as the general category of a likeness or image. Malchut also acts as a “lens” or “looking glass” which shows the other Sefirot in the form of images or likenesses, because they can all be apprehended only through Malchut.
<b>It is through Malchut that all are made in the form in which they are made.</b> This means that only through Malchut can they be revealed and seen, and this is the reason why they all appear in the way they do in the prophetic vision. Malchut is like a lens or mirror, in which the form in which the objects standing before it appear depends upon its own intrinsic fitness and quality as a lens or mirror (polished, clear or unpolished, blurred, etc.)
<b>Accordingly, the Kabbalistic sages said it is impossible to ascend or receive except through Malchut.</b> This indicates that it is impossible to gain any perception of the higher realms except in this way.
<b>Part 2: Even the very forms of the images themselves...</b> It is not enough to understand the attribute revealed through and represented by a given prophetic image. It is also necessary to understand why it is that the attribute in question has to be represented by this image in particular.
<b>...provide knowledge of the wisdom with which the worlds are governed.</b> For Malchut is the root of the lower realms, and it is necessary to understand the various ways in which it is connected with them and how they are rooted in it. Afterwards, when you see the lights (i.e. the upper Sefirot) as depicted in these images, you will then understand how any particular light must be drawn down into the lower worlds precisely in this guise as a result of the unique qualities inherent in Malchut. For example, the prophetic image of the lion represents Chessed or Abba. If you understand what a lion is by contemplating the form of a lion in the lower world, you will then understand why Chessed must be channeled by the Indwelling Presence into the lower worlds precisely in this manner. And this is why the earthly lion, which emerges from Malchut, is made in this form.
<b>...For through them we may know how the Shechinah (God’s Indwelling Presence) needs to govern for the sake of the matter (represented in a given image).</b> Through understanding the images of prophecy in general – how the form of the creatures in the lower worlds is bound up with Malchut and its unique qualities – we can know how the levels and powers of Malchut are bound together to produce the thing in question.
<b>...and to bring it down to the level of the lower realms.</b> Malchut’s power to depict things through images stands in the middle, between the flow of spiritual sustenance from the higher Sefirot and the receiving of that sustenance by the lower worlds. On their own intrinsic level up above, the sustaining powers (the higher Sefirot) are simple. However, when they descend in order to send spiritual sustenance into the lower worlds, the Shechinah must forge a bond of connection between the two. This is done by “translating” the simple light of the higher Sefirot into a form in which it can be received in the lower worlds through various “contractions”, and the light can then go forth in this manner to its place in the lower worlds.
<b>From and through Malchut, it is possible to gain knowledge of the levels above it, these being the actual powers and attributes of God’s government (i.e. the Sefirot themselves, as opposed to the images through which these powers and attributes appear when seen through the lens of Malchut).</b> This is quite obvious, because the prophetic visions derive from Malchut, and through Malchut it is possible to gain an understanding of the powers with which God governs the world and their rules of operation.

Chapter 12

<i>The entire governmental order and everything that exists are all a single order arranged in the underlying Likeness of Man. Adam Kadmon (“Primordial Adam”) encompasses everything.</i>
<b>The entire government of the universe in all its cycles until its completion, and so too, the totality of all that exists, all comprise one single system and one order instituted by the Emanator, blessed be His Name, with one goal: to bestow goodness to the utmost degree of perfection. All of the various different creatures and the laws through which they are governed are necessary for the fulfillment of His plan. Underlying the entire order is the archetypal Likeness of Man (</b>דמות אדם<b>, <i>d’mut Adam</i>) with his full complement of limbs. All are linked together in a single system, exactly as they are in man. Accordingly, Adam Kadmon, which is the totality of everything, is the totality of this order formed in this likeness. It follows that the Emanator, blessed be His Name, brought into being a single existence: the Order of the Likeness of Man. The totality of everything that exists, including all of the various creatures and the order by which everything is governed, is bound up with this underlying perfect likeness.</b>
The proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: The entire government of the universe...</b> This tells us that the entire government of the universe and all that exists constitutes a single order. <b>Part 2: Underlying the entire order is the archetypal Likeness of Man...</b> This tells us that the entire order takes the form of the archetypal Likeness of Man.
<b>Part 1: The entire government of the universe in all its cycles until its completion...</b> This means everything that has happened and everything that is destined to happen in the future until the very end of the universe... <b>and so too, the totality of all that exists...</b> This includes all of the lights above (the Sefirot) and all the created realms and beings below (the worlds and their inhabitants), including their substance, form and qualities. <b>...all comprise one single system and one order... </b>This means that you should not think – because you see so many creatures of so many different kinds, this one serving one function, that one serving a different function – that they do not all enter under a single system like branches emerging from a single root. For a mere random multiplicity lacking any order or unity of purpose in its constituent parts is not commendable.
Consider the case of a person who possesses a variety of different skills. He may know how to do metalwork and painting and how to make music. We might say that the reason why he does all these different things is because this is what he knows, and if he knew more, he would do more. We are not obliged to find any connection between one field of expertise and another, or between different examples of the person’s work in various spheres. What he knew, he did.
But the Holy One, blessed be He, has made so many creatures. Should we therefore say that he made just as many creatures as the number of great skills He possesses, like the man who knows how to do metalwork, paint and make music, and who does each of the things he does because he possesses the requisite expertise? The immediate objection can be raised: “Have you then exhausted all the praises of your Master?” (<i>Berachot</i> 33b) Does He possess no other knowledge except that exhibited by the work we see? Why did He make just so many creations and no more? Why did He not make just one?
We must understand that it is not so: the various different things we see in the world are not totally separate, unconnected items created for all kinds of different reasons. There is one single reason for everything: everything is part of a single order that is made up of many particulars – these being its various branches. There are just as many branches as there are creatures. You cannot ask: “Why aren’t there any more?” For in order to accomplish the goal intended by the Supreme Mind, it was necessary to have precisely this number of different creatures.
This single order was <b>...instituted by the Emanator, blessed be His Name, with one goal: to bestow goodness to the utmost degree of perfection.</b> This defines the purpose of everything. It is a complete order the purpose of which is to bestow perfect goodness. We must understand that all of these different parts of the creation are necessary in order for it to be complete, in order to attain the goal of bestowing goodness to the ultimate degree of perfection.
<b>All of the various different creatures and the laws through which they are governed are necessary for the fulfillment of His plan.</b> As explained earlier, the actual creatures themselves contain within them allusions to different aspects of the overall system of government, and are built accordingly in all their laws and details. Everything that happens in the world is part of the overall governmental order. All the different creatures and everything that happens to them makes it evident that everything is part of a single system of government and a single order whose purpose is the bestowal of perfect good. Each and every creature is needed, for each of them points to a particular aspect of the overall system of government.
<b>Part 2: Underlying the entire order is the archetypal Likeness of Man (דמות אדם, <i>d’mut Adam</i>)...</b> Of the archetypal Likeness of Man it is written: “Let us make Adam in our image, after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26). We see that this likeness includes and encompasses all the powers of holiness.
<b>...with his full complement of limbs...</b> Just as each individual Partzuf divides into 613 lights, these being its 613 limbs and interconnecting channels, so too the totality of existence is made up of 613 limbs and channels, all of which constitute a single overall likeness. For even though each of the different worlds is considered to be a world in itself, they are all only limbs of this overall likeness. The interconnections and interrelationships between the different worlds are the interconnections and interrelationships between the constituent limbs of this single order. Thus – <b>All are linked together in a single system, exactly as they are in man.</b> The meaning of this should be clear in the light of what we have said above.
<b>And therefore, Adam Kadmon, which is the totality of everything, is the totality of this order formed in this likeness.</b> We will see clearly below (Opening 31) that the entirety of all that exists is called Adam Kadmon (“Primordial Adam”). All of the worlds above and below are considered to be only parts of this, like branches emerging from the root. Everything in its entirety is this Adam Kadmon, and as discussed later, “The Ten Sefirot of Adam Kadmon fill the entire void”, as will be explained in due course with the help of Heaven.
<b>It follows that the Emanator, blessed be His Name, brought into being a single existence:</b> The greatness of the Supreme Wisdom lies in the fact that He did not create a multiplicity of different things with no common direction, but rather, a single existence. This single existence is so great in every respect that when we examine its particulars, we find all the different details that we see now. Accordingly we say that this entire existence takes the form of a single man – Adam – and that all these parts that exist now constitute the limbs of this Adam. Accordingly, this single existence is called <b>the Order of the Likeness of Man.</b> Anything we wish to understand with respect to any of the existent beings we see, we will understand in relation to this underlying Order of the Likeness of Man.
<b>The totality of everything that exists, including all of the various creatures and the order by which everything is governed, is bound up with this underlying perfect likeness.</b> As explained earlier, the perfection of the order that He brought into being required all these different creatures and the order through which they are governed.

Chapter 13

<i>The underlying spiritual forms. The circular and straight or upright form: general and individual providence.</i>
<b>The underlying spiritual forms seen in prophecy show things in accordance with the nature of each particular form as it actually appears in the lower world. Thus the circle (<i>igul</i>) indicates an encompassing mode of government without differentiation in terms of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy, but rather, like a general, overall providence reflecting the distinctive quality of the particular Sefirah seen in this form. This is from the standpoint of causal development (<i>hishtalshelut</i>). On the other hand, the straight or upright form (<i>yosher</i>) indicates detailed government varying according to the requirements of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy – right, left and center. The same approach applies to all the other forms seen in the prophetic vision.</b>
<i>Having explained in general terms how the Chariot appears in the prophetic vision, we will now begin to discuss some of the more basic details that need to be understood. First of all is the general form in which the Sefirot appear, circular or upright.</i>
The proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: The spiritual forms...</b> This discusses in general terms how the forms seen in the prophetic vision are to be understood. <b>Part 2: Thus the circle...</b> This explains the circular and upright, linear schemes in which the Sefirot appear.
<b>Part 1: The underlying spiritual forms seen in prophecy show things...</b> We already know that the spiritual form or picture (תמונה, <i>temunah</i>) that we are talking about is nothing but a light (הארה, <i>he’arah</i>) shining from Malchut, which shines in this particular way because Malchut is the root of the created, “separate” realms in which this form or picture is actually found. It follows that the prophetic vision must be interpreted accordingly: the prophetic image must be understood in accordance with the way the corresponding form appears in the material world. We refer to the form seen in the prophetic vision as the <i>underlying</i> form (סוד התמונה, <i>sod hatemunah</i>). This is because in the prophetic vision, what is seen is not the physical form as it exists in the material world but rather the spiritual root of this form, and thus we call it the <i>underlying</i> form. The way that the subject of the prophecy must be understood is <b>…in accordance with the nature of each particular form as it actually appears in the lower world.</b> This should now be quite clear.
<b>Part 2: Thus the circle (<i>igul</i>) indicates an encompassing government without differentiation in terms of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy...</b> This is a general point that applies to all the Sefirot. They can all appear in both circular and straight or upright form. This is because, as a hierarchical order consisting of different levels, the Sefirot may be viewed either in terms of the causal chain through which one develops from another, or in terms of the way they actually govern.
In terms of the way the Ten Sefirot manifest level by level, each successive Sefirah is caused by and develops from the one above it. In this aspect, it is of no relevance that one Sefirah inclines towards Kindness while another inclines towards Judgment. For although in terms of government, Kindness and Judgment act in partnership, from the point of view of their development, Judgment emerges from Kindness. From the developmental viewpoint, each successive Sefirah is lower than the one above it, and the Sefirah of Gevurah, “Strength”, develops out of Chessed, “Kindness”. Thus the sages said: “The waters conceived and gave birth to darkness” (<i>Midrash Rabbah</i> Exodus 15:22). In other words, Kindness, symbolized by water, produced Judgment, symbolized by darkness. From this point of view, the Ten Sefirot emerge as ten levels, one below the other. Because of the additional fact that every higher Sefirah bears and carries the Sefirah below it, we can picture them as one inside the other, like the skins of an onion.
However, in terms of the way in which the worlds are governed, Gevurah ascends and stands facing Chessed, while Tiferet, “Beauty”, also rises and stands between them. Similarly, Hod, “Splendor”, rises up and stands against Netzach, “Victory”, and so on in the same way. Thus the government of the worlds in detail is ordered on the basis of the three lines of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy.
Since the Supreme Will wanted to show these different aspects by means of the forms seen in the prophetic vision, He instituted these two forms: circles, and the straight or upright form. The circles indicate the developmental chain through which the Sefirot emerge one from another, while the upright, linear depiction indicates the governmental order, in which the Sefirot are arranged along the three lines of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy. Matters relating to the causal and developmental interrelationship between the Sefirot must be understood from the circles, while matters relating to government must be understood through the linear depiction.
From the developmental point of view, there is no difference at all between Kindness (right) and Judgment (left), for Gevurah (left-leaning) emerges from Chessed (right-leaning) and is beneath it, just as Netzach (right-leaning) emerges from Tiferet (center) and is beneath it. What this means is that when examining the developmental aspect, we do not take into account a particular Sefirah’s action in terms of its own distinctive quality. Rather, we consider the level of this Sefirah in terms of how near to or far from the Source it is. From this point of view, the distinctive qualities of this particular level are not evident in detail but only in a general way as part of the overall providence. Thus the underlying form of the circle is like a sphere that is completely round and does not divide into parts, for you cannot say it has a head, top or beginning, or a bottom or end, or a middle, right or left.
When a circle is seen in the vision of the Chariot, the immediate inference is that this is a radiation of light (הארה, <i>he’arah</i>) that shines in a general, undifferentiated way. It encompasses all the created realms and beings, and accordingly takes the form of an encompassing sphere or circle, inasmuch as it encompasses and shines to the entire existence contained within it without any differentiation. Thus the Supreme Will maintains this lowly world in existence through a general providence which makes no differentiation between one species and another or between one individual and another, but which encompasses all the created realms and beings equally.
The form of the circle only indicates the way in which the light seen in this form shines down generally over all that exists within it. But what are the particular powers of this level? This is not the place for these to be revealed but elsewhere, when the light appears in a different form, one that divides it into its different sides properly. Thus the circular form indicates only a general providence – an encompassing mode of government that does not divide into different sides or aspects in terms of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy.
Nevertheless, even in the circular form, there is a difference between the qualities of each of the different circles, for one is called Chochmah, “Wisdom”, another Binah, “Understanding” and yet another Da’at, “Knowledge”, etc. What this means is that all the Sefirot exercise a general providence over all that exists, and accordingly everything that exists is under the providence of all of the ten equally. These ten kinds of providence are arranged hierarchically, with the providence of Keter, the “Crown”, being the outermost of all of them and encompassing all of them. That of Chochmah is inside that of Keter, and so on in the same way down to the end. However, when we examine the actual government of the worlds, the Sefirot do not all act equally in this way, but each according to what is appropriate, depending on the time in question and in response to people’s behavior. Thus in terms of the government of the worlds, any one of the different component levels may or may not act at any given time, while its overall influence certainly continues when we consider the circular or developmental aspect.
<b>...like a general, overall providence reflecting the distinctive quality of the particular Sefirah seen in this form. This is from the standpoint of causal development (<i>hishtalshelut</i>). On the other hand, the straight or upright form (<i>yosher</i>) indicates detailed government varying according to the requirements of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy – right, left and center.</b> In other words, the different “sides” – right, left and center – indicate Kindness, Judgment and Mercy. When there are different “sides”, we can measure the degree to which a given force extends, assess the relative power and quality of different forces, trace their effects and make all the other distinctions that are discussed in relation to the Partzufim. Each Partzuf is an upright array of powers arranged along the lines of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy.
<b>The same approach applies to all the other forms seen in the prophetic vision.</b> This should now be clear, because the information derived from the prophetic vision depends upon the nature of the forms seen, whether they be general or specific lights, whether they spread or do not spread. For example: each point is a root of light that stands above but does not extend below, while each line is a light that spreads or extends. The same applies to all the forms and likenesses seen in prophecy: what they signify above corresponds directly to what the actual physical form signifies here below.

<big><strong>Fundamentals relating to the Sefirot and their rule (Openings 14-17)</strong></big>
<i>The governmental order was structured to produce man possessing free will – and everything is laid down in Keter.</i>
<b>The existing structure of the Sefirot – the entire structure of the different levels, the purpose of the levels themselves, the purpose of all their parts, their various properties and all their interconnections – is the first foundation of the government instituted by the Emanator, blessed be His Name. For He knew that this is what is necessary, no less and no more, to bring about one complete cycle of government in order to attain the intended goal of His creation, which is the perfect bestowal of good.</b>
<i>Having explained the forms and likenesses in which the Sefirot appear in the prophetic vision, we will now discuss what relates to the Sefirot in themselves and their various attributes.</i>
<b>The existing structure of the Sefirot – the entire structure of the different levels...</b>
The Supreme Mind (המחשבה העליונה, <i>HaMachshavah HaElyonah</i>, lit. the Highest Thought) calculated how to make man in such a way that he would have intelligence and a good inclination, and also an evil inclination that he can control. The Supreme Mind calculated how to give man a method of service through which he can earn merit, or how to punish him until he becomes fit, so that afterwards he may receive his eternal reward. Each one of these matters involves many details. What we must understand is that the Supreme Mind calculated exactly how many levels were necessary to attain this object, and He made this precise number of levels, not one more and not one less.
This can be compared to the case of a person who wants to produce something that requires fire but not too fierce a fire. The person must put the exact quantity of wood that will enable the fire to burn with no more than moderate heat. If he adds one extra piece of wood, the fire will burn too strongly, but if he puts one piece too little, the fire will not burn at the necessary heat.
Similarly, the Supreme Mind knew on what level it was necessary for man to be built in order that he would be in the situation described above. He made just as many levels as were necessary, no less and no more, with just so many interconnecting links, no fewer and no more. Of this the sages said: “‘And God saw all that He made and it was very good’ (Genesis 1:31) – A man should not say, ‘If I had three legs...’” (see <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 12:1 and <i>Zohar</i> III, 239b). As we will explain in the coming proposition, here it is forbidden to ask for a reason. This is because in order to understand the calculation, it would be necessary to know all that the Supreme Mind knew, and this is impossible.
However, after the levels and their interconnections were laid down, now that we know that they are all directed only towards the ultimate goal, we can then investigate the function of these levels within the scheme of government. We can examine their purpose and study their constant forward movement towards the overall goal.
In short, we cannot ask for a reason why the Sefirot exist and have this structure, because there is no better reason than the fact that this is the way it is. With exactly these levels arranged as they are, and through man’s emergence from them on his appropriate level, he emerges with precisely the nature that it was required that he should have.
<b>...the purpose of the levels themselves...</b> namely, the Sefirot, each with its own unique quality <b>...the purpose of all their parts...</b> These are their 613 lights, parallel to the 248 limbs and 365 interconnecting channels of the human form. <b>...their various properties...</b> These are the laws in accordance with which the lights function, parallel to the natural laws governing man. <b>...and all their interconnections...</b> This refers to the different states of the Partzufim and how they are garbed in one another.
One should not seek a reason for all of these, because the overall reason is that they are all required to produce this composite entity with his unique nature precisely the way it is. Man’s eternal nature has to be this way in order that he may serve and attain perfection, as discussed earlier and as will be discussed further later on.
<b>...is the first foundation of the government instituted by the Emanator, blessed be His Name.</b> For everything that we discuss in relation to the Sefirot concerns only the laws by which the worlds are governed. All these laws are revealed by means of lights. The first of all the laws is this basic principle. This is the first light, and this is Keter, as will be discussed below. (The reason for all the different parts of the creation is embedded in the Sefirah of Keter.)
<b>For He knew that this is what is necessary, no less and no more, to bring about one complete cycle of government in order to attain the intended goal of His creation, which is the perfect bestowal of good. This should now be clear in the light of the above.</b>

Chapter 15

<i>About Keter, the first foundation, it is forbidden to ask. From Chochmah onwards it is a mitzvah to investigate.</i>
<b>As to why the entire structure exists in the way it does, this being the first foundation of the Sefirot, one may not ask for a reason, because this depends on the Supreme Will. However, it is permissible to investigate and seek to understand everything that comes after this foundation, namely how these levels function in the government of the worlds.</b>
<i>Having explained this first foundation, we will now discuss where it is forbidden to investigate and where it is permitted.</i>
<b>As to why the entire structure exists in the way it does, this being the first foundation of the Sefirot, one may not ask for a reason...</b> As I said above, this first foundation is Keter, of which the sages said, “Do not search out that which is too wondrous for you” (<i>Chagigah</i> 13a). For the light of Keter is the law that is the first of all the levels. This law ordains precise levels and their arrangement in just the way they are now. Thus Keter is literally the totality of everything, and Keter is bound up with Eyn Sof, blessed be He, Who is the all-powerful Will.
Accordingly it is impossible to understand the root of this axiom and why it is precisely this way, because it is rooted in the All-Powerful, in the perfection of the Supreme Will. It is certainly forbidden to occupy ourselves with Eyn Sof, namely in His intrinsic perfection as it is from His side as the All-Powerful, for this is already beyond the grasp of thought. It follows that it is forbidden to exercise the mind in seeking to understand Keter in the sense of trying to discover its reason or purpose, for these are rooted above, as discussed earlier. Accordingly, of Keter and Eyn Sof it is said, “Do not search out that which is too wondrous for you... that which is covered from you” (<i>ibid.</i>) <b>...because this depends on the Supreme Will</b>, as we have said above.
However, Chochmah is the thought that divides things into their particulars in the proper way in accordance with what has already been established in the first axiom, which instituted just as many levels and aspects as necessary. Chochmah then specifies all that is required for the government of the worlds in detail, as it is written: “You made them all with Wisdom – <i>Chochmah</i>” (Psalms 104:24). Now what exists in Chochmah also exists in Keter, in that Keter also includes everything involved in the government of the worlds. However since this is not in the sense of how they actually operate in order to govern but rather in the sense of their basic existence, the light of Keter does not reveal how they govern at all but only the fact of their existence. Here there is a reason for their existence, and this depends upon the Supreme Will. This is what it is forbidden to investigate.
But when it comes to the way the worlds are governed as specified in detail in Chochmah, it is a positive mitzvah – a duty – to seek knowledge and understanding. Now Binah is the revelation of Chochmah, while Zeir (the “Small Face” = Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet-Netzach-Hod-Yesod) and Nukva (“the Female” = Malchut) are the totality of the entire government, dividing into seven categories. It is precisely these that were already rooted in Chochmah and there they were divided in the proper manner, while Binah brought them all forth individually, each one in its proper place.
In other words, the Mind (מחשבה, <i>machshavah</i> = Chochmah) calculated the totality of everything, all bound to their ultimate goal (= Keter), and this encompasses the totality of the entire government. But it is Binah that brings each one forth individually in actuality without its being bound to any other. On the contrary, each one must accomplish what it has to accomplish in its proper place. The seven lower Sefirot constitute the various types or varieties of government. Accordingly, everything that comes after this first foundation is subject to inquiry.
<b>…However, it is permissible to investigate and seek to understand everything that comes after this foundation, namely how these levels function in the government of the worlds.</b>
We are not investigating either the essence of the Emanator, blessed be His Name, or even the essence of the Sefirot themselves, which are in simple unity with the essence of the Emanator – for they are nothing but the powers of His thought. We are concerned only with the functioning of His powers and the way they govern. Of this it is said: “In what is permitted to you, seek understanding” (<i>Chagigah ibid.</i>).

Chapter 16

<i>Two kinds of direct and returning light: in the governmental order and in the developmental chain</i>
<b>The Sefirot shine with two kinds of direct and returning light:</b>
<b>(1) After the descent of the Sefirot level by level from Keter to Malchut, Malchut in turn becomes Keter, and so on in the same way until Keter becomes Malchut. This shows the absolute control and perfection of Eyn Sof. For everything emanates from Him, and He is the end goal of everything, as it says: “I am first and I am last” (Isaiah 44:6). He is revealed as such at the beginning as at the end. The closer any given level is to Him, the more it is magnified with His Name, and what was Malchut becomes Keter.</b>
<b>(2) No light accomplishes its purpose until it emerges from and then returns to its Source. In other words, the light descends with great power all the way down to the bottom. Afterwards, as it ascends, it leaves down in its place below the level in question, while the light itself goes up. The given level then remains there, built in its place within the structure, and so in the case of all of them.</b>
The proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: The Sefirot shine...</b> This is a prefatory statement setting forth a fundamental aspect of the Sefirot. <b>Part 2: After the descent...</b> This explains the above statement.
<b>Part 1: The Sefirot shine with two kinds of direct and returning light.</b> This means that in the prophetic vision, these two kinds of direct and returning light are seen.
<b>Part 2: (1) After the descent of the Sefirot level by level from Keter to Malchut, Malchut in turn becomes Keter, and so on in the same way until Keter becomes Malchut.</b> In the vision, this looks exactly “like the appearance of lightning” (Ezekiel 1:14). A flash of lightning looks as if it comes out from one side and travels over to the other side, then immediately afterwards, it appears to turn from the other side back to the side from which it came. Similarly, all the ten Sefirot, in every place where they are, appear in this way whenever they are seen. Keter emerges first from the Source, and the levels descend one by one to Malchut. Afterwards, Malchut itself is seen to be Keter emerging from Eyn Sof.
This is because Eyn Sof, blessed be He, encompasses the Sefirot as seen in the prophetic vision both above and below. The light flashes from above and descends, spreading downwards. As it spreads, so it becomes weaker, and when it reaches the bottom it returns to the Source below – Eyn Sof, Who encompasses below. Then the light goes back and flashes from below upwards, following exactly the same path. Thus “the Chayot were running and returning like the appearance of <i>lightning</i>” (<i>ibid.</i>).
<b>This shows the absolute control and perfection of Eyn Sof. For everything emanates from Him, and He is the end goal of everything...</b> The whole point of this image in the prophetic vision is to show that the Sefirot are not something outside of Him in any way, for nothing exists against His will, but that His light shines in this way (within the Tzimtzum, like lightning) until it disappears. In other words, what is concealed (in the Tzimtzum) is the perfection that was in Him from the beginning (before the Tzimtzum), just as it is now (in truth, even in the phase of concealment, within the Tzimtzum, for even within the present concealment, His perfection is really in control), just as it will be at the end.
Between the one and the other (between the initial and final perfection, within the Tzimtzum), all the Sefirot exist – they are the source of the entire government of all the worlds, for everything is included in these ten Sefirot. And what is the end goal of the entire government? The restoration of perfection (Eyn Sof, beyond Tzimtzum) as at first. Thus during the concealment, the government starts from Keter, and does not end until Malchut. And when it is complete, what is the point? The point is that the perfection, which was initially concealed, is now fully revealed. This will be discussed further below (see Opening 30).
The prophetic vision was so instituted because all ten Sefirot are a complete cycle of government emerging from Eyn Sof, blessed be He, and returning to Eyn Sof, blessed be He. Now, if you count the levels from the concealment (Tzimtzum) onwards, the first will be Keter, the second Chochmah, and so on until the end. But if you view the steps as leading to the ultimate future revelation after the entire cycle – for this is where the entire cycle leads – the first step after the concealment is the very first to approach the end and is thus the furthest away from it. Inasmuch as it is close to the head, it is called Keter, but because it is furthest from the end, it is called Malchut. So it is in the case of all of them. Thus the descent of the worlds under the government of the Sefirot one after the other turns out to be their ascent, as will be explained presently.
<b>As it says: “I am first and I am last” (Isaiah 44:6).</b> This refers to His encompassing everything above and below, in order to show that He is everything. <b>And He is revealed as such at the beginning as at the end.</b> What this means is that in order to understand the government of the worlds, it is necessary to understand it as follows: At first, there was complete perfection – “Everything was filled with the simple light of Eyn Sof” (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Igulim VeYosher</i> 1:11:3). This perfection was then concealed (through the first Tzimtzum or “contraction”). Then the governmental order came into being (the Kav or “Line”). The end goal of the government is also complete perfection as at first (the complete revelation of His unity).
<b>The closer any given level is to Him, the more it is magnified with His Name, and what was Malchut becomes Keter.</b> This means that the ends turn about (from Malchut to Keter and from Keter to Malchut) and all the others change around in sequence (Yesod into Chochmah etc.).
<b>(2) The second kind of direct and returning light: No light accomplishes its purpose until it emerges from and then returns to its Source.</b>
The first kind of direct and returning light – in the government of the worlds, as we have been discussing until now – is constant. The second kind relates to how the lights are generated within the causal chain (<i>hishtalshelut</i>). No light is generated except through the descent of the flash (<i>he’arah</i>) and its subsequent ascent from there (i.e. from the place to which it descended), for then the level in question remains there, as stated below.
<b>In other words, the light descends with great power all the way down to the bottom.</b> When a given light has to make one or several levels, it descends faultlessly and without hindrance but rather with great power. It then ascends again, leaving behind what it leaves (i.e. a trace – <i>reshimu</i> – of its radiation, namely the level that remains there below). This is because what descends is the actual light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, for all the lights emerge from Him. Since they remain there in their place (after the ascent of this great light), the individual limited light suited to that level takes on its own existence. When the great light ascends to return to its source, this part remains. This is what creates the bond connecting the lights themselves with their source.
For every branch is rooted in its source, and its power below is not like its power at its root above. Do not think that the way a given power appears below now is the same as its power above at source. When a power descends, its own essential root descends, for as yet the branch does not exist. After reaching the place of the branch, the root ascends, leaving the branch it produced in its place below. The branch pursues its source after the source’s ascent.
<b>Afterwards, as it ascends, it leaves down in its place below the level in question, while the light itself goes up.</b> This is when it has to make levels: the light descends with power and then ascends. As the light ascends, so it leaves levels – the levels from which it ascends, leaving them behind. <b>The given level then remains there, built in its place within the structure, and so in the case of all of them.</b> For it is when the great power of the root activates the branch that the branch emerges. The branch emerges only in its proper place. The root power descends to the place of the branch, and from there ascends, leaving the branch formed there and built into the structure. The root light does the same thing (i.e. it leaves level after level) as it continues its ascent to the very end of all the levels.

Chapter 17

<i>Sefirah and Partzuf: Government – overall and detailed.</i>
<b>There is a Sefirah and there is a Partzuf. A Sefirah is a power that is one power out of the ten overall powers. As one of these powers, the Sefirah is the foundation on which is built the entire structure of particulars dependent upon it. But the Partzuf shows in detail the complete perfection of each whole power, seen explicitly in the form of the fundamental Likeness of Man. Its root lies in the secret of 613, which constitutes the entire structure of Adam.</b>
<i>We will now discuss another fundamental that must be understood in relation to the Sefirot themselves.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: There is a Sefirah and there is a Partzuf.</b> This introduces the subject of these two categories. <b>Part 2: A Sefirah...</b> This explains these two categories.
<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE</small></b></sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word Sefirah (ספירה) has the connotations of radiating light, and also of counting: each Sefirah is one in a count of several. The Hebrew word Partzuf (פרצוף) denotes the “face” or overall visage presented by a person to those who see him or her.</i><b>Part 1: There is a Sefirah and there is a Partzuf.</b> Two categories may be understood in relation to the Sefirot: Sefirah and Partzuf. And the Sefirot themselves sometimes appear like this and sometimes like that. But for now we will say that the entire government of the worlds (הנהגה, <i>Hanhagah</i>) can be examined in terms of Sefirot and also in terms of Partzufim. These are the two pathways of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero of blessed memory (1522-70) and the Holy Rav, the ARI of blessed memory (1534-70).
<b>Part 2: A Sefirah is a power that is one power out of the ten overall powers.</b> When we speak about the laws of the government, the Ten Sefirot constitute all the basic types of laws. It is clear that since the entire government is also included in them and the details of the government are many, if so these are the ten types that include all the details. <b>As one of these powers, the Sefirah is the foundation on which is built the entire structure of particulars dependent upon it.</b> Everything relating to the government must be understood in terms of these two categories: either which Sefirah or which Partzuf it is?
As we have already discussed earlier, the Partzufim are nothing but arrays in which the powers extend, ordered along the lines of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy and their levels, in all their pathways, their laws of control and their mode of government.
The ten Sefirot are ten powers and no more, and they constitute the appropriate levels of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy as discussed by the early Kabbalistic sages, the Mekubalim (<i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> 1:3, Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, <i>Pardes</i>, beginning). And these are the foundations of the entire government. But the detailed pathways of each one of these ten powers is what we call a Partzuf. There is no Partzuf without a Sefirah.  This means that in order to understand matters relating to a Partzuf, it is first necessary to understand the Sefirah and to undertand its function among the other ten powers. After this, we will seek to understand its pathways in detail, and then we will understand it as a Partzuf.
You will therefore find no problem in the fact that Rabbi Moshe Cordovero of blessed memory interpreted the entire <i>Zohar</i> only in terms of the Sefirot, for it is certainly true, of course, that the entire government depends upon the Ten Sefirot. Except that in this aspect, we understand the government through them but not through their parts – we know in general what comes out of them.
And when we know the Partzuf, besides knowing from which Sefirah something in the world derives, we will also know from which part and which aspect or feature of that Sefirah it derives. Thus each Partzuf is initially a Sefirah: this is the foundation upon which that particular structure is built. More than that, it is a Partzuf. Thus the proposition continues:
<b>But the Partzuf shows in detail the complete perfection of each whole power, seen explicitly in the form of the fundamental Likeness of Man.</b> To be called a Partzuf, it is not enough that it is a particular. It is because this particular is ordered according to the fundamental Likeness of Man that it is called a Partzuf or “face”.
<b>Its root lies in the secret of 613, which constitutes the entire structure of Adam.</b> This is in respect of the way the array of parts extends. It is true that each Sefirah consists of ten, and there could have been any number of parts when the Sefirah divides up into its particulars. Nevertheless, in truth what the Supreme Thought calculated was 613, and this is what we see here below in the human form with its 248 bones and 365 sinews making a total of 613. So too the commandments of the Torah consist of 248 positive commandments and 365 prohibitions making a total of 613. For everything goes according to this measure.

Chapter 18

<big><strong>Letters and Names (Openings 18-23)</strong></big>
<i>The government of the worlds is implemented through the letters.</i>
<b>In order to produce an actual effect, all the supernal lights must enter into the category of letters. The letters constitute a complete order that exists to bring all things into actual being. This is the meaning of the verse: “...and through the <i>word</i> of God the heavens were made” (Psalms 33:6). For speech exists only in virtue of the letters of which it is made up.</b>
<i>Having explained what the Sefirot are, we now turn to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet with which they are associated, as discussed by the Kabbalistic sages.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: In order to produce...</b> This introduces the subject by explaining that the lights can operate only through the letters. <b>Part 2: The letters constitute...</b> This explains what the letters are.
<b>Part 1: In order to produce an actual effect, all of the supernal lights...</b> The entire purpose of the wisdom of the Kabbalah is to understand the particular root of each of the different phenomena we find in the world. Anything that can exist without being dependent on something else must have its own root.
To apply this to the subject of our present discussion: The lights are preparations on the level of thought for all the different created realms and beings and the entire governmental order through which they are run. However, for these to come into actual existence is a further stage, because thinking about something does not necessarily make it actually happen. If so, we need to identify a separate root through which they actually come into being. The particular root involved here is the letters. Accordingly, in order for the supernal lights to produce an actual effect, they <b>must enter into the category of letters.</b> The letters consititute a single root produced through a separate radiation. Everything prepared in the Sefirot on the level of thought must enter this level and pass through this root in order to come into actual being.
<b>Part 2: The letters constitute a complete order...</b> Each root that we can identify as serving a particular purpose or function is ordered appropriately in its own unique way, and everything that has to pass through the root in question must enter into this unique order. Since the letters are the root through which what is conceived in thought is executed in actuality, when the thought is ready to be implemented, it requires the order of letters <b>...which exists to bring all things into actual being. </b>The letters do not stand as part of the governmental order in the same way as the attributes and Sefirot, which define and shape it. Rather, the purpose of the letters is to put into actual effect the governmental order already prepared on the level of thought. The order of the letters is so arranged as to ensure the fulfillment of the executive function dependent upon it.
<b>This is the meaning of the verse: “...and through the <i>word</i> of God the heavens were made” (Psalms 33:6).</b> For initially there is the thought – Adam Kadmon – but this is concealed. The revelation of thought comes about through speech, which consists of letters. Whatever is concealed in thought must enter into the category of speech in order to be revealed. However, the component parts and organizing principles of thought are by no means identical with those of speech, for a thought is in the mind, whereas in speech we express our thoughts in words and letters. In order to communicate what is in our minds, what is conceived in thought must be submitted to the rules of language and cast in the form of letters and words. The same applies in the upper worlds. The first order is that of thought. Its revelation comes about through speech. What is conceived in the mind within the parameters of thought can come forth in speech only within the parameters of speech, namely through the letters.
<b>For speech cannot exist without letters.</b> The verse provides clear proof that all things come into being through the letters, for speech is made up of letters. The actual creation of the universe came about through speech. If so, the actual creation of the universe came about only through the letters, as will be discussed further below.

Chapter 19

<i>The 22 letters</i>
<b>In total, the letters consist of twenty-two different kinds of orders or arrangements, no less and no more, in order to give the lights the power to act.</b>
<i>Having introduced the subject of the letters, we will now discuss their number.</i>
<b>In total, the letters consist of twenty-two different kinds of orders or arrangements</b> <b>(סדרים, <i>sedarim</i>)...</b> As you have already heard, each different function has its own particular root, and this root is organized into orders or arrangements that are fitted to the root in question and its intended function. The quality and number of levels in each of these various orders or arrangements is an individual matter depending upon the intended function of any given order. In the case of the letters, each individual letter is one of the various different orders or interconnected clusters of lights necessary to bring about action. Each letter is a unique root suited to the execution of the action that has to emerge from it.
<b>...no less and no more...</b> The reason why there are twenty-two is rooted in the first foundation, into which it is forbidden to inquire, as discussed earlier (Opening 15). For these are the levels required for the intended purpose <b>…in order to give the lights the power to act…</b> so that the lights prepared in the Sefirot can produce their requisite effects, as will be discussed further below.

Chapter 20

<i>The letters are different combinations of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy – lines and dots, signifying opening and closure.</i>
<b>The entire key to the organization of the various orders or arrangements constituted by the letters lies in the secret of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy – right, left and center – which join together in different combinations, varying in terms of closure and compression or opening and unfolding: the line and the dot.</b>
<i>Having explained that the letters are orders or arrangements, we will now explain the basis on which they are organized.</i>
<b>The entire key to the organization of the various orders or arrangements constituted by the letters...</b> Each of the letters is a particular arrangement or order of lights based on a specific organizational law whereby the lights operate in union for one purpose: to ensure that the intended effect emerges in the proper way. It is necessary to understand the foundation on which this organizational law depends. It <b>lies in the secret of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy.</b> For every effect comes about as a result of the force produced by a particlar combination of the three fundamental qualities of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy. These join together in different combinations varying in terms of closure and opening, as discussed below. These three qualities correspond to <b>right, left and center</b> – namely the sides of the letters.
<b>...which join together in different combinations, varying in terms of closure and compression...</b> In this case the lights shine in a mode of concealment, radiating only as a source. <b>…or opening and unfolding…</b> In the latter case, the lights shine in such a way that the radiation spreads. Sometimes the closure or compression may be in the middle, while the opening may be on the right or the left, and so on.
Opening and closure are signified respectively by <b>the line and the dot…</b> these are the fundamental components of all the letters. The letter Yud is a dot, while the letter Vav is a line. For example the letter Aleph has closure on the right and the left (the two Yuds), and extension in the middle (the diagonal Vav).

Chapter 21

<i>The action of the letters is completed by the musical notes, vowel points and crowns.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE</small></b></sup><i class="footnote"> In the Torah scroll, only the Hebrew letters (<i>otiot</i>) are written, in some cases with “crowns” (<i>tagin</i>) over them. The associated vowel signs (<i>nekudot</i>) and musical notes (<i>taamim</i>, the cantillation marks) although unwritten are also integral parts of the oral Torah tradition (the Masoret).</i><b>The completeness and perfection of the letters depend on the musical notes, vowel points and crowns that are joined with them. All of them contribute, each in its own proper way, to the full and complete execution of the intended effect or action. However, the main action comes about through the letters.</b>
<i>Having explained the letters, we will now discuss the musical notes, vowel signs and crowns that are joined with them.</i>
<b>The completeness and perfection of the letters depend on the musical notes, vowel points and crowns...</b>
Each thing has to be examined as an individual root in order to establish whether it is the main factor in itself or merely a component part that comes to complete the main factor, as discussed below. The main action is executed by the letters themselves, while their completion and perfection lies in the musical notes, vowel signs and crowns...
<b>...that are joined with them. All of them contribute, each in its own proper way, to the full and complete execution of the intended effect or action.</b> This is something we can see with our own eyes. As it is below, so it is above. Here below in this world, we see that the letters of the Torah are complete only when accompanied by their accompanying musical notes, vowel signs and crowns. So too above, the notes, vowel signs and crowns are bound up with the letters themselves and serve one and the same purpose.
However, the main action comes about through the letters. Similarly in this world, we see that the written letters alone are sufficient to give us an understanding of the text.

Chapter 22

<i>The musical notes, vowel signs, crowns and letters are governed by the order of the ten Sefirot included in the name of Havayah and its expansions.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE</small></b></sup><i class="footnote">When each of the four constituent letters of the holy name of Havayah is spelled out in full (מלא, <i>maleh</i>), the resulting holy name is known as an “expansion” (מילוי, <i>milui</i>, literally a “filling”) of the root name. The “filling” of the letter Yud is constant (יוד, YUD), but the letter Heh may be “filled” either with a Yud (הי, HeY) or an Aleph (הא, HeA) or a Heh (הה. HeH), while the letter Vav may be spelled in full either with a Yud (ויו, VIV) or an Aleph (ואו, VAV), or with neither (וו, VV). Different spellings of the four root letters of the name produce different “expansions” each having its own characteristic numerical sum (גימטריא, <i>Gematria</i>). The four main expansions of HaVaYaH take their names from their gematrias:</i><b>All the various kinds of functions found in the Sefirot are without exception governed under the order of the ten Sefirot, which is the order of the four letters of the Name, blessed be He. And this is the order that governs the musical notes, vowel signs, crowns and letters through the four letters and the four names contained in each one of them.</b>
The proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: All the various kinds...</b> This explains that all the different orders fall under this overall order. <b>Part 2: And this is the order...</b> This explains how the musical notes, vowel signs, crowns and letters fall under this order.
<b>Part 1: All the various kinds of functions found in the Sefirot are without exception governed by the order of the ten Sefirot…</b> All the different categories we distinguish in the Sefirot apply to everything. Thus each Sefirah divides into ten Sefirot, for each Sefirah and every part of each Sefirah contains the entire order of government (except that in any given case the particular Sefirah in question has more influence). Accordingly, wherever we look, we will always immediately distinguish ten divisions corresponding to the ten Sefirot. Even when the lights need to divide in other ways in order to carry out their function, nevertheless everything must come under this tenfold division. Each of the different levels divides into its own individual levels, but overall they make up a total of ten levels.
<b>...which is the order of the four letters of the Name, blessed be He.</b> The four letters of the Name of Havayah, blessed be He, contain all the ten Sefirot according to their essential division into five Partzufim. Thus the cusp of the Yud is Arich Anpin (=Keter) while its main body is Abba (=Chochmah). The first Heh is Imma (=Binah), the Vav is Zeir Anpin (=Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet-Netzach-Hod-Yesod), while the final Heh is Nukva (=Malchut).
<b>Part 2: And this is the order that governs the musical notes, vowel signs, crowns and letters through the four letters...</b> The musical notes, vowel signs, crowns and letters are all separate functions, each of which emerges from its own particular source. Yet all are governed by the overall order, which is that of the Name of Havayah, blessed be He. <b>...and the four names...</b> namely AV, SaG, MaH and BaN, the four expansions of the Name, which also correspond to the four letters
<b>...contained in each one of them.</b> Each one of the four levels – the musical notes, vowel signs, crowns and letters – contains the four root letters of the Name and the four expansions of AV, SaG, MaH and BaN. Thus each of these four levels extends as a complete array of ten Sefirot, which are contained in the four letters and four names we have mentioned.

Chapter 23

<i>The lights execute their functions through the holy names which make up the Torah.</i>
<b>It is through the names that the lights come to execute their functions, and their sum total constitutes the Torah. It is therefore called the craftsman’s tool of the Holy One, blessed be He.</b>
<i>Having discussed the letters, we now turn to the holy names, which are made up of various letter combinations.</i>
The proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: It is through the names...</b> This introduces the subject of the divine names of which the Torah consists. <b>Part 2: It is therefore called… </b>This explains the executive function of the names, which are the “craftsman’s tool” of the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>Part 1: It is through the names that the lights come to execute their functions...</b> For we see that the execution of all the different functions depends upon the holy names, of which there are many. All of the various names are understood as different combinations of interconnected lights (since each name is a unique combination of letters, and the letters are clusters of lights, as explained in Opening 20). It is from these lights that the angels receive their power to act. At the root of the matter lies the fundamental idea set forth here: that it is the letters which bring the lights to execute their functions. The letters join together in various combinations, producing different names to execute the various functions. Each name possesses a unique power to execute a particular function, and it is through the different names that all the different functions are executed. The Torah constitutes the sum total of all these names, as the sages said: “The whole Torah is made up of the names of the Holy One, blessed be He” (<i>Zohar</i>,<i> Yitro</i> 87a, and Ramban’s Commentary on the Torah, Introduction).
<b>...and their sum total constitutes the Torah.</b> In other words, the Torah is the sum total of all the different arrangements that were instituted in order to actually bring forth the various functions into the world. This is besides the Torah’s esoteric meaning, for the esoteric meaning of the words of the Torah is bound up with the mystery of the Sefirot, which are the very roots of the different functions. Thus it is through the Sefirot that we may understand the way in which the world is governed. However the actual execution of the different functions comes about through the letters. Thus, in addition to their esoteric significance, the various names and letter permutations possess this special power of execution.
<b>Part 2: It is therefore called the craftsman’s tool of the Holy One, blessed be He.</b> From the point of view of its esoteric meaning, the Torah is called “plans and registers... as used by a master builder to know how to make the rooms and how to make the openings...” (<i>Bereishit Rabbah</i>, beginning). In other words, the content and esoteric meanings of the words of the Torah explain the “why” of creation: its blueprint and reasons. But besides this, the actual letters of the Torah are literally the craftsman’s tools with which the work is actually executed. This comes about through the different permutations of letters, as in the case of the various names, which can visibly be seen to bring about an immediate effect either through their very mention or when they are used in other ways (such as in writing in the form of amulets, or in meditation in the form of Yichudim). Thus everything is contained in the Torah, including both the underlying thoughts and arrangement of creation, which are contained in the esoteric meanings of the words of the Torah, and the execution of these thoughts in actuality through the permutations of its Holy Names.

<big><strong>The Tzimtzum and the Line (Openings 24-30)</strong></big>
<i>The act of Tzimtzum</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE</small></b></sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew noun Tzimtzum (צמצום) denotes the act of contraction, pressing, squeezing or forcing into close confinement.</i><b>In bringing about the creation as a work outside of Himself, the Eyn Sof, blessed be He, willfully set aside His limitlessness and adopted a path of limited action. This is called the Tzimztum (contraction) of Eyn Sof, blessed be He.</b>
<i>Having discussed how to understand the Sefirot, we know that they were an innovation. We must now learn how they developed thereafter. You have already heard that in viewing the Chariot, there are two factors: the vision and the explanation – seeing and understanding. I will now proceed to explain the vision. Since I have already set forth elsewhere the details of what is seen in the vision (see </i>Pitchey Chochmah VaDaat<i> and </i>Klalut HaIlan<i>), you should now be able to understand them, for what follows is the explanation of the details. In order to make things easier, from this point onwards I will indicate how the various aspects appear in the vision.</i>
The proposition has three parts: <b>Part 1: In bringing about the creation as a work outside of Himself...</b> This tells us where the Tzimtzum took place – to what it applied. <b>Part 2: ...the Eyn Sof, blessed be He, willfully...</b> This tells us what the Tzimtzum was. <b>Part 3: ...and adopted a path of limited action...</b> This tells us how the Tzimtzum took place.
<b>Part 1: In bringing about the creation as a work outside of Himself....</b> The Supreme Will, which is Eyn Sof, blessed be He, includes different kinds of powers having no end or limit. But we are not talking about His aspect of limitlessness, with which we have no connection. Rather, we are talking about that particular power among His innumerable powers that is the cause of <i>us</i>. The power that causes <i>us</i> is His power to bring about a work “outside” Himself – in the sense of creating and governing apparently separate, independent realms and beings. This He did in accordance with His quality of goodness, for the nature of goodness is to bestow goodness upon others. If so, we are talking only about His acts and works, not about His own intrinsic essence.
The truth of this is affirmed by the Tzimtzum itself. For the Tzimtzum took place only for the sake of the creation. If it had some other purpose, it would have had a different outcome. Since we see no other outcome of the Tzimtzum except the creation, which is its true outcome, we may say that the Tzimtzum was for the sake of the creation.  Further, His act of Tzimtzum prepared the way for the creation to come into being in a way suited to the nature of the created realms and beings, which exist within limits. If so, the Tzimtzum was for the sake of the creation. What is accomplished by all of Eyn Sof’s other powers – with the exception of the particular power that is the cause of the creation – is not for the sake of the creation. If so, the Tzimtzum took place only in that which is for the sake of the creation, namely in His power to bring about the creation as a work outside of Himself.<br> In other words, among His limitless powers there is one power – the law that goodness bestows goodness – which is the power to create realms and beings that exist as separate entities “outside” of Him. This is the power that is affected by the Tzimtzum, for initially this power was limitless, but He contracted it in order to create beings that exist within limits.
Correspondingly, in the vision, the Tzimtzum appears in one place, while all around it is Eyn Sof, blessed be He. In other words, His power to create creatures – one among all His other powers – appears in one place. All around it are all His other powers, endless and without limits. His aspect of limitlessness is removed from one place only, and this is what is subject to the contraction.
<b>Part 2: ...the Eyn Sof, blessed be He, willfully set aside His limitlessness...</b> It is already clear to us that the Supreme Will in Himself is beyond all limits. Accordingly, we must not think that He created only what He was able to create and that he was unable to create any more than this. He is certainly capable of much more, but He did not want to do more. He acted not in His aspect of omnipotence and limitlessness, but with precisely the degree of power that He calculated to be perfectly suitable to accomplish the intended purpose of His action. Thus we see that even though in Himself He is without limits, He set aside His limitlessness in order to bring about the creation. Accordingly, we may say that the power that is the cause of creation already lacks the aspect of limitlessness, which has departed from it.
To say that He set aside His limitlessness implies firstly that the Sefirot are not something new that was not already included in Eyn Sof, blessed be He. Prior to the Tzimtzum, the Sefirot already existed on a plane of limitlessness, and this is what He set aside in the Tzimtzum. The second implication of saying that He set aside His limitlessness is that as long as the Sefirot were totally subsumed in Eyn Sof, we cannot say they existed in the same way as they do now. We must say that they existed in some other way. For the difference between existence within limits and existence on the plane of limitlessness is not only one of quantity but also of quality. In their unlimited aspect, those same Sefirot had a different quality: they existed in a different way. If so, when they took on limits, they received a new quality. This is the sense in which they were an innovation. Through being revealed within limits, they came into being in the way they exist now, and this is the innovation.
Proof of these two inferences is as follows: The concept of limitlessness implies that every power which can possibly exist in the world and which might afterwards be found within bounds and limits must also exist on the plane of limitlessness without any boundaries at all. Accordingly, we must think of the limited power that brought the created realms into existence as being subsumed within the unlimited, and there its limits disappear. We may conclude from this that the pathway of limitation is included within the unlimited without boundaries.
It could be objected that if the pathway of limitation exists on the level of the unlimited <i>without</i> limitations and boundaries, this cannot be said to be the pathway of <i>limitation</i>. This objection may be answered if we distinguish between the kind of concept that includes another concept in the sense of affirming or maintaining its existence, and a different kind of concept that includes or involves another concept only in the sense that it is its very opposite and its negation. An example of the latter is death. The idea of death has no meaning without life, which death brings to an end. Death thus includes life in the sense that it is the negation of life, not that it sustains life. This is not so in the case of life, which does not include death at all.
Similarly, limitlessness includes limitations and boundaries – in the sense that it is their very negation. This is the way in which the Sefirot exist in Eyn Sof, blessed be He. For the entire way in which He acts now – within boundaries and limitations – was already conceived on the plane of limitlessness as a hypothetical possibility that was, however, negated by His very limitlessness. If so, the finite existed in the infinite as a hypothetical possibility. When Eyn Sof wanted His intrinsic limitlessness not to touch this part, it came into being in the way that it exists now, within limits.
This is quite simple, for the pathway of limitation was conceived by Eyn Sof, except that at the level on which He conceived it, it was beyond limits and boundaries because His intrinsic limitlessness held sway and brought it back to His level, which is beyond limitations. However, when Eyn Sof, blessed be He, <i>removed</i> His limitlessness from it, it remained as He conceived it prior to the removal of His limitlessness, except that now it was an <i>actual</i> creation as opposed to a hypothetical possibility. Thus, prior to the Tzimtzum, the Sefirot were included in Eyn Sof – which is the first inference made above. However, on that level they existed not in the way they exist now but in a different way, which is the way of limitlessness. This is the second inference made above.
The way in which this appears in the prophetic vision is that Eyn Sof, blessed be He, contracts Himself in one place, leaving a place void of Him. This expresses how the work of creation is revealed with the aspect of limitlessness removed.
<b>Part 3: ...and adopted a path of limited action. This is called the Tzimztum (contraction) of Eyn Sof, blessed be He.</b> This indicates that the Tzimtzum is not only a matter of the absence of limitlessness. The Tzimtzum itself sustains the realm of boundaries and limitations in being. The Tzimtzum causes the disappearance of limitlessness, maintaining the boundaries and limits in being. In the realm of limits and boundaries thereby revealed lie the roots of <i>Din</i>, Judgment.
One may object: If the Tzimtzum is merely the departure of the aspect of limitlessness – a matter of negation – how can the Tzimtzum positively sustain or maintain anything in being? The answer is that it is the Will that wanted to reveal things in actuality (rather than their remaining as a mere hypothetical possibility) which brings all this about. What He wanted to reveal is His limited power. Accordingly He removed His aspect of limitlessness from it. If so, it is the act of Tzimtzum that actually sustains in being the limited realm revealed through it. This realm is revealed in accordance with His Will, through the removal of His aspect of limitlessness from the place of the Tzimtzum.
The way this appears in the vision is that in the place that remains contracted after the act of Tzimtzum, the root of Judgment is revealed, and this is what is maintained in existence through the Tzimtzum.

Chapter 25

<i>The result of the Tzimtzum: the Sefirot became visible.</i>
<b>This Tzimtzum caused some of His light and radiance to become visible, whereas previously – and this applies even now to those levels where the Tzimtzum does not reach – they could not be seen or grasped in any way. And this light that is permitted to be seen is called emanated light, for it seems like a light that was newly generated. But the truth is that it is only a certain aspect of the primordial light, whose power was reduced through the Tzimtzum.</b>
<i>Having introduced the subject of the Tzimtzum, we must now trace its consequences, starting from the very first.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: This Tzimtzum caused....</b> This informs us that the effect of the Tzimtzum was to enable the Sefirot to be seen. <b>Part 2: And this light...</b> This provides further understanding of this effect.
<b>Part 1: This Tzimtzum caused some of His light and radiance to become visible...</b> For you surely already know and understand that what is beyond boundaries and limits cannot be seen. Initially the path of limitation and boundaries subsumed in Eyn Sof was also invisible, inasmuch as it was subject to His all-encompassing limitlessness, which turns all limits back beyond limits. But when the Tzimtzum removed the aspect of limitlessness from this pathway, the pathway remained there and now became visible. This is what caused <b>...some of His light… to become visible...</b> This is the light of which we spoke earlier, which Eyn Sof wanted to be accessible so that the attributes of the supreme law would appear by way of radiations of light – the Sefirot.
What this means is that it was not only as a result of the Tzimtzum alone that the divine attributes became visible as radiations of light, nor was this simply the inevitable consequence of the Tzimtzum. What the Tzimtzum did was only to remove the aspect of limitlessness from His power to bring a separate creation into being “outside” of Himself, so that from then on the work of creation would be subject to an orderly law within bounds and limits. Combined with this was His desire that this law should be able to be seen, and this is what caused the light to be visible.
Thus we see that the light’s ability to be seen was not merely an effect of the Tzimtzum but resulted from God’s will that it should be visible. Prior to the Tzimtzum, however, it was impossible for the light to be seen because it had no bounds or limits. If so, we may say that the Tzimtzum caused the light to become visible not in the sense that the Tzimtzum was the intrinsic cause of the light’s ability to be seen but because the removal of limitlessness made it possible for it to be seen.
<b>...some of His light and radiance...</b> “Light” and “radiance” are terms that apply to the radiation emitted by a source of light. The radiation surrounds the source on the outside. This implies that the radiance that shines from Him is not something devoid of any intrinsic relationship with Godliness, serving merely to designate Godliness in the way that an agreed sign may be chosen to indicate a given object although the sign has no intrinsic relationship with the object in question. On the contrary, this radiance is integrally related to Godliness, which it signifies directly.
For all that we see of Godliness is the Sefirot. However, the Sefirot are one way in which the Supreme WIll wanted to show His laws. This way is not intrinsic to Him but one that He willfully chose. If so, what we see of Godliness is not intrinsic Godliness in itself but only what He wants us to see. In that case, it might seem that you could not legitimately call the Sefirot Godliness but that you could only say they point to and indicate Godliness in a way similar to the way a written name designates the bearer of that name. The letters making up the name have no intrinsic connection with the bearer of the name but simply refer to him through an agreed convention. While the letters designate the bearer of the name, they are not in themselves a part of him in such a way that we could say they possess some intrinsic quality belonging to him. Yet we have called the Sefirot Godliness. If so, it must be that this radiation contains something Godly.
The truth is this: The radiation of light is Godly. In what way? Godliness is hidden from the created realms and their inhabitants, but they must nevertheless receive some revelation of it at the time when it is revealed to them. A comparable case is that of the beams of light that radiated from the face of Moses our Teacher, peace be upon him. Someone who stood before Moses would be ashamed to look directly in his face and would lower his eyes – and then he would see Moses’ radiance. Godliness is revealed to His creatures in the same way, yet they do not see it directly. What they see is only the radiance shining from Him, and this radiance is the Sefirot. This radiance relates to its Owner, being the revelation of the splendor of the glorious essence that remains concealed. That which is revealed of Him – this radiation of light, the Sefirot – is the radiance of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, namely the revelation of His splendor. If so, the Sefirot are bound up with Eyn Sof, blessed be He, the Owner and Source of this radiation.
It could be objected that we are saying on the one hand that because the radiance relates to its Owner, having emerged from Him, it is therefore intrinsic to Him. On the other hand, we have said that the radiation was willful and not intrinsic, in which case the radiance does not relate to Him directly. If so, how can we call the Sefirot Godliness?
The answer is that it was God’s will that the Sefirot should somehow be able to be apprehended by His creatures. When we say that the Sefirot are a radiation of light, what this means is that they emerged in such a way that they could be grasped by God’s creatures. If so, the radiation was brought about willfully by God and is not intrinsic to His essence. His will was that the Sefirot should emerge by way of a radiation of light, but it could have been in a different way – any way He might have chosen. However, the way He actually instituted was to make it possible for them to be apprehended by His creatures in the same way as a radiation that relates to the source emitting it, enabling us to gain some knowledge of that source without actually seeing its intrinsic essence.
In other words, the Sefirot relate to His intrinsic essence, but the way they appear to us is subject to His will, and accordingly, His intrinsic Godliness is not visible to us. We may say that the Sefirot are Godliness in respect of their own intrinsic essence, but they are not Godliness inasmuch as they are visible to us, and the way they appear is bound up with the nature of the observer. If so, the radiation of the light was a willful act of God, yet at the same time, the radiating light is bound up with its Owner. It is freely chosen in respect of the form in which it appears, but bound up with Him in its essence, inasmuch as it is a revelation of the Owner of the radiance. This explains the phrase of the sages describing the Tzaddikim in the future world as “enjoying the radiance of the Divine Presence” (<i>Berachot</i> 17a). They do not see the Divine Presence itself but attain a perception of the glory standing over them.
<b>...whereas previously – and this applies even now to those levels where the Tzimtzum does not reach – they could not be seen or grasped in any way.</b> Because of its visibility, there is a difference between the light we have been talking about – the light of the contracted Sefirot – and all that existed prior to the Tzimtzum, as well as Eyn Sof even now, after the Tzimtzum.
<b>Part 2: And this light that is permitted to be seen is called emanated light...</b> This is what the Kabbalists refer to as “emanated light” (אור נאצל, <i>ohr ne’etzal</i>, see <i>Etz Chayim</i> 1:3, 12b and 13b). One might mistakenly infer from the use of this expression that the Sefirot are an essentially new light which Eyn Sof drew forth and emanated from Himself, yet which is still Godliness inasmuch as the Emanator is attached to the Sefirot. This would certainly be an error, because drawing one thing out of another is a bodily occurrence. If so, we cannot say of Godliness that He drew one thing out of another, because that which He draws forth will also be Godliness.
It is called emanated light for the reason written here: <b>…for it seems like a light that was newly generated:</b> There was no need for the essence of the light to be generated as a new creation since it existed already in Eyn Sof. The innovation was that it should exist in the form of <i>visible</i> light. This is because whenever a given subject enters a new state different from its initial state, this may legitimately be called an innovation in its mode of being. In this case, a new state came into being: a state in which the light was visible – which was not its initial state. If so, this is light in a new state of existence. For although in its essence it is the same as it was at first, the state of the light as visible was an innovation, and this is what is meant by emanated light.
<b>But the truth is that it is only a certain level of the primordial light, whose power was reduced through the Tzimtzum.</b> For the way of bounds and limits was originally subsumed within Eyn Sof, blessed be He, only His aspect of limitlessness caused the light to expand beyond all limits. When the aspect of limitlessness was removed from it, it remained with its limited power. If so, the light is from the very essence of Eyn Sof, but the Tzimtzum reduced and limited its power.
In the prophetic vision, the way in which this appears is that a new light – the light of the <i>Reshimu</i>, the “Residue” – was generated from the concealed Source – Eyn Sof.

Chapter 26

<i>Details of the Residue that filled the Empty Space.</i>
<b>This emanated light was called a Residue of the Primordial Light, which because of its supreme greatness could not be apprehended. This Residue is called the Place (or Space) of all that exists, because this is what gives them the ability to exist, which the aspect of limitlessness did not give them. This place or space is said to be empty, and it is devoid of the light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, in the sense that His limitlessness is not found there as at first.</b>
<i>Having explained that as a result of the Tzimtzum, a new light emerged, we must now discuss further details about this light.</i>
The proposition has three parts: <b>Part 1: This emanated light...</b> This explains that the emanated light was only a trace of the first light that disappeared. <b>Part 2: This Residue is called...</b> This explains that this emanated light has the power to provide a place or space for all that exists. <b>Part 3: This place or space is said to be empty...</b> This explains the concept of “emptiness” as it applies to this “place”.
<b>Part 1: This emanated light was called a Residue (רשימו, <i>reshimu</i>)...</b> It <i>was</i> called a Residue, but only until new developments took place in it. This is because different names and descriptions are given to the lights according to their different functions, and the light which we are presently calling the Residue will later be called “worlds”, “buildings”, “structures” and various other names. However, before we trace these later developments, we shall refer to it by the term that applied to it originally, when it was called the Residue.
It was <i>called</i> the Residue, even though this term does not fit completely. This is because a residue is a trace left over from something that is in the same category, only greater, while the remaining trace is less. However, in the case in hand, the light that disappeared was not visible light, while the light that remained is visible light. Thus they are not in the same category, and the light that remained is not exactly a “residue” of the Infinite Light. We cannot truly say that it <i>is</i> a residue of that Light, only that it is <i>called</i> a residue. As to why it is so called if it is not really a residue, you will see later.
<b>...a Residue of the Primordial Light...</b> This indicates that the light that remained was not new and different from the light that disappeared, but rather that it was like a small part of it. Prior to the act of Tzimtzum, it was not recognizable as something separate in itself, but after the Tzimtzum it could be recognized as such.
We will be able to gain a deeper understanding of this entire matter by considering the relationship between Malchut and the other Sefirot as found in the lower realms from Atzilut downwards. In other words, the relationship between Malchut and the other Sefirot, as found in the worlds of Atzilut and below, will provide an analogy through which we may understand the relationship between the Residue and the departed Primordial Light of Eyn Sof. This is because the Residue is called Malchut of Eyn Sof.
Let us first consider the analogous case. Malchut is the root of the created worlds and their inhabitants. And what is Malchut? Malchut is the last part of the Sefirot of Zeir Anpin (i.e. the last part of all the Sefirot making up the Partzuf of Zeir Anpin – Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod – representing all the upper Sefirot; each of the upper Sefirot includes all ten Sefirot and therefore has its own individual Malchut). For the root of the lower realms and beings is the last part – the last power – found in each individual Sefirah.
Now we may object: If so, this would imply that the lower realms have <i>ten</i> roots – these being the ten last parts of all ten Sefirot – not just <i>one</i> root in the overall Malchut. The answer is that the law that the lower creatures should exist is called Malchut (the overall Malchut). This is a bond of all the powers contained in the ten Sefirot to bring forth the lower realms. For each Sefirah contains a power that relates to bringing forth the lower realms and beings, and this is its individual Malchut (such as Malchut of Chessed, Malchut of Gevurah, etc.). The overall Malchut is the law that the lower realms should exist. And from what is this law or light constructed? It consists of the totality of the powers existing in each of the individual Sefirot to bring forth the lower realms.
In other words, the overall Malchut is a bond of all the individual Malchuyot of each of the ten Sefirot. Even so, these separate powers would be hanging in suspense but for one general, overall law which they need: namely that the lower realms should exist. This general law or power (the overall Malchut) includes all of these specific powers (the individual Malchuyot of each of the ten Sefirot). This is what makes the potential actual. The bond of all these powers contained in each of the individual Sefirot to bring forth the lower realms is the law called Malchut.
Having understood the analogous case, the relationship between Malchut and the higher Sefirot as manifested in the realms below, let us now apply this understanding to the subject of our present discussion, the upper level – the relationship between the Residue and the departed Light of Eyn Sof. For all that remains revealed after the Tzimtzum is referred to as Malchut of Eyn Sof. In other words, all that departed – leaving only the specific power to create independent worlds and beings – may be considered parallel to the nine upper Sefirot as found in the lower realms. On the other hand, what remains after the Tzimtzum – created worlds and beings existing within bounds and limits – may be considered parallel to the Malchuyot of these nine Sefirot. And what is Malchut? The overall Malchut is the bond of all the powers found in the individual Sefirot to bring forth the lower worlds. Malchut is the general law that all the Sefirot should bring forth the lower realms and beings according to what is rooted within them.
We therefore call this light that is revealed in the Residue after the Tzimtzum “Malchut”, and we say that it is like the last part of all that departed, which we have compared to the nine higher Sefirot. Accordingly we call it a Residue of all that departed.
We must distinguish between two different aspects here. The bond of these parts, namely the law that the lower realms should exist – this being the overall Malchut in its proper place – we will term the Place or Space of the lower realms. This is the power that gives a place for their existence. But inasmuch as the overall Malchut is built of the residue of all that departed and includes the power contained in each Sefirah to bring forth the lower realms, we can term this the actual root of the lower realms.
These two aspects are also found in Malchut below. For Malchut is a “place” or “space” in the sense of providing the possibility for lower realms to exist. In addition to this, Malchut itself is also the individual root of each one of them, because the overall Malchut includes all the individual Malchuyot of all the other Sefirot.
<b>...which because of its supreme greatness could not be apprehended.</b> Here is the reason why we may call this a Residue even though it is not strictly in the same category as the light of Eyn Sof, which cannot be seen, while the light of the Residue has an end and a limit and can be seen. The reason is because there is a way in which they can be considered to come under one category. Since we have called Eyn Sof, blessed be He, “Simple Light”, and the light of the Residue is also light, they both come under the category of light, even though the one cannot be seen, while the other is visible light. For we may consider the ability to be seen a contingent occurrence in the Residue that could not apply to the first light.
This is supported by the point made earlier (Opening 5) that even in the case of the Sefirot, the ability to be seen is not intrinsic to their nature but was willfully instituted. Eyn Sof wanted the minimal power that constitutes the realm of limits and boundaries to be visible, while that which is beyond limits He did not want to be visible. Accordingly we apply the word Residue to the limited power subsumed within His limitless power. The Supreme Will wanted this limited power to be capable of being seen.
One could object: Firstly, how can we say that what departed was nine Sefirot? Surely the Sefirot are limited, whereas what departed is without limits and if so, cannot be considered in the category of nine Sefirot? Further, the nine Sefirot are nine separate functions, whereas in the case of the Unlimited, it is impossible to speak of separate parts. If so, what departed was not nine Sefirot, for you cannot ascribe parts to the Unlimited. Clearly, there is no difference between one part and another except by virtue of the boundary that divides between them, whereas on the level of the Unlimited, the concept of boundary is not applicable in any way, and if so, it is impossible to speak of parts.
These objections may be answered as follows: It is true that the Sefirot are limited, while that which departed is without limits, and from this point of view we should not have compared what departed to the Sefirot. It is impossible to compare what departed, which is without limits, to these parts that remained, which fall within the category of limitation. Nevertheless, the nine Sefirot, although limited, do still give an indication of the Unlimited, while Malchut is actually on the boundary.
For the root of the matter is that the limited functions necessary for the entire existence of created realms and beings are in truth nine parts, which constitute the structure of Malchut itself. This is the pathway of limitation and boundaries that had been subsumed within Eyn Sof, as discussed earlier (Opening 24). However, the Unlimited overwhelmed each of these nine, bringing them back beyond limits. Thus we find here ten Sefirot: nine levels of limited action (e.g. the Malchut of each individual Sefirah: Malchut of Chessed, Malchut of Gevurah, etc.) all having one objective and all considered as constituting one Sefirah – the overall Malchut.
The sway which the Unlimited holds over each of them is considered as the other nine Sefirot (e.g. Chessed of Chessed, Gevurah of Chessed, etc. and so too in the case of every Sefirah, with the exception of the Malchut of each one). From their point of view they are not divided, for the Unlimited holds sway over every part of the pathway of limitation and boundaries, bringing it back beyond limitation. Inasmuch as the Unlimited holds sway over these nine Sefirot, bringing them back beyond limitation, they are spoken of as the nine Sefirot of Eyn Sof, but not on account of what they are in themselves. However, the Sefirot after the Tzimtzum are all parts of Malchut: after the Tzimtzum, we refer to the nine Sefirot only from the aspect of their Malchut, and accordingly they are all limited. The Malchut of each of the individual Sefirot is the pathway of limitation and boundaries that was subsumed in Eyn Sof as a hypothetical possibility prior to the Tzimtzum, while the upper nine Sefirot of each individual Sefirah indicate the Unlimited, Who holds sway over the pathway of limitation. They are not the Unlimited in Himself, but give enough indication of Him as is necessary for the sake of the government, as will be explained in the appropriate place.
<b>Part 2: This Residue...</b> The existence of this Residue depends upon the bond of all the individual Malchuyot of the nine higher Sefirot, this being the law that the lower realms should exist – Malchut, the tenth law of the Ten Laws constituted by the Ten Sefirot. Accordingly, the bond of the last, bottommost powers contained in the Unlimited, which joined together to make the Residue in this way, is the overall Malchut. This is the “place” of the created realms and beings, for this is the law that gives them existence. The Residue itself is made up of these powers that were joined together, these being the root of the lower realms, as below.
<b>... is called the Place (or Space) of all that exists, because this is what gives them the ability to exist, which the aspect of limitlessness did not give them.</b> It is called a “place” or “space” inasmuch as it fulfills the function of a place or space, which contains that which stands within it. However, it is not a place in the physical sense of being an actual place containing whatever stands within it. For the concept of physical space is not applicable to the Sefirot, since they are Godliness, and Godliness has no physical dimensions.
<b>Part 3: This place or space is said to be empty</b> (חלל, <i>chalal</i>,<b> </b>literally “hollow”) in the sense that it serves as a container to hold others. It is a particular level whose essence is such that it needs others to exist in and depend upon it (like a space waiting to be built up, which is empty as long as it is not filled with buildings). Since the essence of Malchut is to enable worlds to exist and be dependent upon it like branches, we say metaphorically that it has a “container”. And as long as only this level existed and the worlds did not exist, we say that the container was “hollow” and “empty”. Since the worlds dependent upon it came into existence, we say that its hollow is full.
Indeed, as long as the Unlimited held sway, everything was completely perfect. As soon as the Unlimited departed, Malchut was revealed as a “container”, but initially it was not revealed as being filled with all its worlds, but rather as an empty space. Nevertheless, it was not completely hollow, for the root of the worlds that were destined to emerge was present in the form of the Residue, except that the Residue was like air, in the sense that the worlds were not discernible. Accordingly, even though its container was full (i.e. of air) it is called “hollow” in relation to Eyn Sof, blessed be He. For initially, prior to the Tzimtzum, there was no need for any further perfection, and even after the Tzimtzum, the encompassing Eyn Sof lacks no perfection whatever. That which is still in need of perfection is called “hollow” – i.e. lacking in perfection in relation to the perfection of Eyn Sof. We therefore say that afterwards, when the Line came down and made the Residue into Sefirot, it “filled” this “hollow”. This is why the Kabbalistic sages said that the Line “filled” the hollow, and that the entire hollow space was filled with the ten Sefirot of Adam Kadmon (<i>Etz Chayim</i> 1:4).
It could be objected: What need is there to say that it is called “hollow” in relation to Eyn Sof? Should we not say it is called “hollow” because it is still in need of perfection? The answer is that inasmuch as the container was at that time filled with the Residue, it should not have been called hollow. However, in relation to the encompassing Eyn Sof, blessed be He, Who is perfect in every way and to Whom the concept of further perfection is not applicable, it is called hollow. It is also called hollow relative to what it was when it was filled with the Unlimited, which departed from it.
<b>...and it is devoid of the light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, in the sense that His limitlessness is not found there as at first.</b> This explains why the worlds can exist on this level in the hollow of which we are speaking, because the Unlimited – which would otherwise not permit the existence of separate levels – is not found there after the Tzimtzum.
The way this appears in the prophetic vision is as a hollow, vacated space, filled with a fine light that we call the Residue. This is the “place” in which all the created worlds will stand, as I have explained.

Chapter 27

<i>How the Line governs the Residue.</i>
<b>Rooted in this Residue was everything that is destined to exist, and what was not rooted there cannot come into being afterwards. Even so, all that is rooted there could not have come into being without the Unlimited Himself governing it. Nevertheless, the Unlimited acts only in accordance with what is rooted in the Residue. This is like the soul, which governs the body solely according to the nature of the body. The action of the Unlimited within the Residue is called one Line from Eyn Sof, blessed be He, that enters into the hollow cavity. For what He actually brings about within the Residue is in accordance with the nature of the created realms and beings. Yet in bringing it about, He Himself acts on His own level of intrinsic perfection. As far as the created realms and beings are concerned, it is the Residue. But through the Line, He acts on His own intrinsic level of perfection. Further, while what was produced is, as far as the creatures are concerned, the Residue, the way in which Eyn Sof operates it is through the Line, which is on His plane of limitlessness, just as He is without limits.</b>
<i>Having explained what the emanated light is, it is now necessary to explain what it produced.</i>
The proposition has four parts. <b>Part 1: Rooted in this Residue...</b> This explains the distinctive quality of this Residue. <b>Part 2: Even so, all that is rooted there...</b> This explains that the Residue requires the Unlimited. <b>Part 3: Nevertheless, the Unlimited acts only…</b> This explains that the Unlimited governs the Residue as the soul governs the body. <b>Part 4: The action of the Unlimited within the Residue is called one Line… </b>This explains the Line in relation to the Residue and how the Unlimited looks down providentially upon the level of the Residue via the Channel or Pipe.
<b>Part 1: Rooted in this Residue is everything that was destined to exist...</b> This is obvious, because, as has already been explained, the Residue consists of what remained of the Primordial Light that departed through the Tzimtzum. For the Residue consists of all that was originally included in the Primordial Light as the root of the lower realms and beings. This remained in the Residue after the departure of all the other powers that were not part of the root of the lower realms and beings. Now, everything that was destined to exist in the lower realms was certainly originally included in the Primordial Light in the category of the root of the lower realms. If so, the Residue is the root of everything destined to exist in the lower realms.
It can be clearly proved that everything destined to exist was originally included in the Light that departed. For what departed was Eyn Sof, blessed be He. Now Eyn Sof includes everything. If so, everything was originally included in what departed.
<b>…and what was not rooted there cannot come into being afterwards.</b> It would not be enough for the Residue to be merely the root of the general categories found in the lower realms, which afterwards divide into their particulars down below. All the lower worlds and beings must necessarily be rooted in the Residue: every single detail must be rooted there. The proof of this is that no detail that is not included in the All-Powerful could possibly exist. The Residue is the revelation of everything that was included in the All-Powerful as the root of the lower realms and creatures. If so, it must be that all the details were also included in the Residue.
<b>Part 2: Even so, all that is rooted there could not have come into being without the Unlimited Himself governing it.</b> For there are entities whose movements are self-generated, and others whose movements depend upon another. For example, the movements of the body depend upon another, while the movements of the soul are self-generated. All this must have a root above. If so, among the lights there must be some whose movements are self-generated, and they are the root of those entities having this property, while different lights, whose movements depend upon other lights, are the root of those entities that have that property.
The Residue is the root of the body, while the Unlimited is the root of the soul. The Unlimited is self-governing, while the movement of the Residue is through the Unlimited. This is what is implied by the words <b>…without the Unlimited Himself governing it.</b> This means that while the Residue contains all the laws and principles by which the lower realms and beings are governed, the source of this government is not there but in the Unlimited. Everything in the Residue is under His control, like an axe in the hand of the hewer.
Two corollaries emerge from this. The first is that the work of the Residue exists only through the Unlimited. The second is that it is the Unlimited that governs the Residue. The word “governs” implies more than mere movement. For if the Unlimited did no more than set the Residue in motion, we could have said only that it could not exist except through the Unlimited. But we are saying that He <i>governs</i> it: that He actually governs and orders what happens in the Residue itself. Let us explain these two corollaries more fully:
(1) The work of the Residue exists only through the Unlimited. This means that even though what Eyn Sof brings about is, as far as the lower realms and creatures are concerned, within limits, this does not mean that He executes what He does in a limited manner like a human being. The way in which He acts is beyond our ability to grasp, because He acts without limits. However, His Will decreed that even though He continues acting in His way, we receive only what reaches us, which is within limits. It is therefore true that the results of His action are within limits but not His actual performance of that action. For the lower creatures can receive only what they are ready and able to receive. Accordingly, in all our discussions, we are speaking only about the results of His action, which are within bounds and limits. But the way in which Eyn Sof actually executes that action is far beyond us. We cannot understand it, and we should not inquire into it, for the boundaries of our knowledge include only what is done and what it means. <i>How</i> it is done, we cannot know.
For example: We know that contracted Sefirot are made from His light, but <i>how</i> He acted to conceal and contract His light we cannot say. This is not the case from the Tzimtzum and downwards, where we <i>can</i> say this. For we can specify the different parts of the Partzufim according to when they hold sway, how their desired effects are produced, and what happens to them when they produce new effects. This is not so in the case of Eyn Sof, to Whom we cannot attribute different “parts” or anything of the kind. Accordingly it is impossible to say how He acted or how these Sefirot radiate from Him now, for the way He acts is without limits.
Let me prove to you that all the ways in which He acts must be without limits. For in Eyn Sof by necessity there can be no change. To act at one time in one way and at another time in a different way would be a change. If so, Eyn Sof, blessed be He, does not act at one time in one way and at another time in a different way. We are obliged to say that the way in which Eyn Sof acts is the same, and that the very act which comes to us within limits is executed by Him in His way, without limits, while we receive what relates to us. That there can be no difference in the way Eyn Sof acts is obvious, for we cannot in any way ascribe physical occurences to Eyn Sof, and change is certainly a physical occurrence, which therefore cannot exist in Him. This is quite clear from the words of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who said: “He does not change in any place” (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Ki Tetze</i> 281a. See also <i>Zohar</i> III, 257b, as discussed in Opening 29).
In sum, we have two things: (a) The results of Eyn Sof’s action; (b) His execution of that action. It is the results that reach us, and these are within limits. However, the way in which He executes the action is concealed from us, and this is without limits. The limited result of His work is the Residue. But the work has to be executed, and His execution of it is without limits, for it is performed by Eyn Sof, blessed be He, Who acts without limits. Thus we see that what is rooted in the Residue exists only through the Unlimited, but if the execution of the action had also been within limits, the Residue would have functioned by itself without need of the Unlimited.
(2) The Unlimited actually governs and orders the Residue directly at one and the same time as He executes His work in His aspect of limitlessness. For in this way, even though the accomplished work follows a different path – the way of bounds and limits – its entire destiny is laid down by Him and its government is under His control. Let me explain: The Unlimited possesses the unique property of ultimate perfection, and in His perfection He is entirely good, as we explained earlier when speaking about His unity. Before Him, there is no evil. It is only when His perfection is concealed that evil can exist, but as soon as His perfection is revealed, evil does not exist any more, as it says, “He will consume death for ever” (Isaiah 25:8).
In order to reveal His unity in the clearest way, He concealed His perfection and instituted a way of imperfection in order to create and govern imperfect creatures. This is the Residue. For even if God’s creatures could attain the ultimate perfection, they still could not attain His perfection, for since they are created beings, they could never attain the level of the Creator. Indeed, inasmuch as this Residue came into being through the concealment of perfection, many deficiencies and imperfections are rooted in it. The truth is that these deficiencies are intended to make it possible for His creatures to exist on different, graded levels and to draw closer to perfection gradually, level by level. This would not be possible if there were no bounds and limits, for the Unlimited contains no levels, and accordingly He is perfect from the very outset.
However, this Residue could have come into being in two ways. Either it could have been subject to a single imperfect law governing imperfect creatures in such a way that they could never overcome their imperfections. Alternatively, it could come into being subject to a single law through which its very deficiencies are gradually corrected until they attain the perfection that was concealed at the outset.
Let me illustrate this with an example. Reward and punishment indicate a lack of perfection, for in a state of complete perfection, everything must be good. With the concealment of perfection, the government hangs in the balance whether to confer goodness or the opposite, depending on men’s deeds in the lower world. This is rooted in the Residue, which contains everything connected with reward on the one hand and punishment on the other: everything is prepared and ready, waiting for the arousal from below – men’s initiatives in the lower world. But things could have gone on this way forever, with the righteous receiving their reward and the wicked being punished. This would have been the case were it not for the fact that the Residue is governed by the Unlimited. However, since everything in the Residue is governed by the Unlimited, it must be that the pathways of the Residue do not remain as they are but continue until they reach perfection. For this reason, there is a limit to the period of choice, reward and punishment: “The world will exist for six thousand years” (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 97a). The Residue is thus like a wheel that turns through just so many degrees until it completes the entire cycle, and at the very end there will be perfect rest.
Thus we see that it is Eyn Sof, blessed be He, Who acts in His intrinsic perfection on His plane of limitlessness. It is Eyn Sof Who executes every action within limits. And just as the execution of the action is carried out to perfection, so too the intention of the action is to bring everything to perfection. It is in order to accomplish this purpose that the action is executed within limits and without perfection. And what is the benefit of this? That even though the intermediary is imperfect – for the work is deficient – nevertheless, the result is that everything is brought to complete perfection at the end of all the cycles.
<b>Part 3: Nevertheless, the Unlimited acts only in accordance with what is rooted in the Residue.</b> Even though we have said that the source of the government is Eyn Sof, blessed be He, in His intrinsic perfection, He has already decreed that this action should reach the lower realms and creatures only within the limited order constituted by the Residue. The goal is to attain perfection, and the truth is that the action itself is perfect, for all is good, as it says, “All that the Merciful One does is for good” (<i>Berachot</i> 60b) and “I will give thanks to You, O God, for You were angry with me” (Isaiah 12:1). But in the lower realms the perfection is concealed, and nothing reaches them except as permitted by the law of concealment. However, the law of concealment was brought about by His perfection, and thus it goes in one direction in such a way that it certainly comes to complete perfection, as discussed above.
<b>This is like the soul, which governs the body solely according to the nature of the body.</b> This means two things. Firstly, the entry of the Unlimited to govern the Residue does not add any new power to the Residue but rather moves and rearranges what was already rooted in it. This is like the soul in the body. The soul does not add anything new to the body but simply animates what is already naturally present in the body. Secondly, the presence of the Line of Eyn Sof in the Residue is itself the root of the soul in the body in this world, and accordingly what happens to them is parallel.
<b>Part 4: The action of the Unlimited within the Residue is called one Line…</b> In other words, the entry of Eyn Sof into the government of the Residue is called a Line from Him that enters inside the cavity. In speaking of a Line, we mean that a single Line was drawn down from the encompassing Eyn Sof, blessed be He, like a channel or pipe, into the cavity. Through this Channel, light descended from Eyn Sof to what is inside the cavity, and by this means the Emanator is attached to that which emanated.
Let me explain: Included among the powers of the All-Powerful is the power to watch over the action of another who exists within limits, separate from Himself. Even though the truth is that “There is none besides Him” and Eyn Sof, Who has no limits, negates any other existence, nevertheless, included in His comprehensive power is the ability to see the limited creation from above and govern it. And since the way of bounds and limits came into being as a new creation, Eyn Sof, Who is All-Powerful, surely watches over it.
Thus we have here three aspects: (1) Eyn Sof’s action in His intrinsic perfection – executing the very things that we receive within limits. (2) What we receive, as we receive it, within limits. (3) The way the All-Powerful looks down to the level of limits and boundaries whereby we receive. The way the All-Powerful looks down to the level of limitations is through this Channel, which is also a Line from Eyn Sof, blessed be He. Through it He looks down into the Residue and watches over it in accordance with the nature of the Residue, which is within limits. What we receive (#2) is the totality of the Residue. The very thing that Eyn Sof, blessed be He, executes in His perfection (#1) is drawn down from Eyn Sof, blessed be He, into the cavity by way of (#3) the Channel or Pipe.
In other words, clothed and concealed within Eyn Sof’s observation of the pathway of limits in His intrinsic all-powerfulness (#3, the Channel) is His all-powerful execution of what takes place in the Residue (#1, the Light in the Channel). Accordingly, we will call the one a Channel or Pipe and the other a Line drawn down within it. Through this light drawn in through the Channel or Pipe, the Residue receives its light from Eyn Sof, blessed be He, and this is how the Emanator is attached to that which emanated.
It is precisely this light that governs the Residue as the soul governs the body. For as you have already heard, the way the All-Powerful looks down into the Residue, through the Channel, is not a radiation different from the Residue: He looks upon it as what it is. However, this Light within the Channel is something different from the Residue, for it is on the level of the supreme perfection of Eyn Sof, blessed be He. Whereas in the Residue there are successive levels of concealment and deficiency, as will be discussed later on, in the soul all is in accordance with goodness and perfection. Thus Eyn Sof’s powers are without limits and we have no connection with His limitlessness except through this one aspect: His power to actually produce a work outside of and separate from Himself. With this we have a connection, for this too is His work, and even with us, He does it with perfection and limitlessness. Nevertheless, we only receive within limits, like the voice that spoke with Moses, which was heard by none except him, even though it was a great voice that did not cease. We therefore say that this is how the Emanator is connected with that which emanated.
You must understand that the Channel or Pipe is not a particular aspect of His creative act. The two operative aspects are the Light drawn in – the Line – and the Residue. The Channel or Pipe simply transfers the action of the Light, which is without limits, to the resulting work, which comes to us within limits – namely the Residue. The Channel itself does not act. The Residue contains all the laws of reward and punishment, because this way we can see clearly the damage to the worlds through the flaws caused by the sinners. The Light within – the Line – is on the level of Unity, where everything is good and there is no evil at all and no flaw, as it says: “Is corruption His? No: His children’s is the blemish...!” (Deuteronomy 32:5). And it is He who governs the Residue, as we have said above, so that in the end there will only be good and perfection.
And these two pathways are called the Name (שם, <i>Shem</i>) and the Form of Address (כינוי, <i>kinui</i>). Now the encompassing Eyn Sof, blessed be He, is complete perfection, and since good negates evil, showing evil and its remedy is not applicable on that level, for “From the beginning He tells the end” (Isaiah 46:10), and all is seen to be good. However, after the Tzimtzum and the concealment, things divide into two: the Name and Form of Address. This means that in the end, the Name will rule and be revealed, while the rule of the “Form of Address” will return to Him, and everything will be in the state of supreme perfection that already exists in the encompassing Eyn Sof.
<b>…one Line from Eyn Sof, blessed be He...</b> For although the Residue has many parts, they are not separate but constitute a complete structure. Only in relation to us are they many, for we can only apprehend each thing by itself. However, the entire new creation brought into being by Eyn Sof, blessed be He, is a complete whole, and the All-Powerful looks down in all His power over this totality as one complete whole. Thus Eyn Sof in His intrinsic perfection executes a single act, and accordingly we say that it is a single Line.
You must understand that we are not saying one <i>part</i> but one <i>line</i>. This is because in Eyn Sof, blessed be He, there is no such thing as different parts. In His very perfection and complete limitlessness, He looks down upon the creation. This overall looking down is called a line, namely a ray, like a sunray emerging from the overall radiance of the sun.
<b>...that enters into the hollow cavity...</b> This is obvious in accordance with the image in the prophetic vision, as we have stated above.<br> [From this point on until the end of the Opening, Ramchal’s commentary diverges from the phrasing of the initial proposition.]
<b>…within which was afterwards created...</b> That is, after the Line entered the Residue and ordered it into its various divisions, the Residue became worlds, as will be discussed later. The Line itself became concealed within the Residue, and accordingly the Line governs the Residue.
As we have said above, through the Line, Eyn Sof, blessed be He, executes this limited act in accordance with His intrinsic perfection. The Channel or Pipe is like a garment for the Line itself, so that we may say that overall, the descent of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, into the cavity is a single Line constituted by the Channel and the Light drawn down within it. For the Line is comprised of these two, and together they are called one Line in the teachings of the ARI.
This appears in the prophetic image as a single line descending from the encompassing Eyn Sof and filling the Residue. This is the Channel or Pipe by which Eyn Sof is connected with what is inside the hollow cavity.

Chapter 28

<i>The Line divides into the Inner and Encompassing Light of the Sefirot.</i>
<b>The Line of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, that entered into the Residue is concealed within it on the inside on all its levels, and is thus said to govern it. Yet it stands outside and encompasses it, and it must be said to include its power and to look down upon it on every side. Even so, all this occurs in such a way that the Line accommodates itself to the Residue. This is the Inner and Encompassing Light of the Sefirot, which is the underlying foundation of the Vessel.</b>
<i>Having discussed the entry of the Line into the empty Space, we must now explain the manner in which it spread out within it.</i>
The proposition consists of four parts. <b>Part 1: The Line of Eyn Sof...</b> This explains how the Line extends within the Residue. <b>Part 2: Yet it stands outside…</b> This explains the Encompassing Light. <b>Part 3: Even so...</b> This explains how the Line accommodates itself to match the Residue into which it enters. <b>Part 4: This is the Inner and Encompassing Light...</b> This explains the different aspects of the spreading light and their names.
<b>Part 1: The Line of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, that entered into the Residue is concealed within it on the inside on all its levels...</b> The concealment of the light of the Line of Eyn Sof within the Residue is the source of the two modes of government discussed earlier: the rule of good and evil and the rule of unity, corresponding respectively to the Form of Address and the Name. The rule of unity is concealed within the manifest rule of good and evil. Accordingly, we say that the Line is concealed. And this is what was gained through having the Line clothe itself within the Residue.
<b>...and is thus said to govern it.</b> As stated earlier, the Residue is governed by the rule of unity. This explains what we mean when we say that the Residue gains from the fact that the Line is concealed within it.
<b>Part 2: Yet it stands outside...</b> The reason why it stands outside is that when the light came to enter into the vessel, not all of it entered. Half of it stands outside, and thus it accomplishes its function while standing in its appointed place – what is within just like that which is outside. These matters are explained further in Part 4 of this proposition.
<b>...and encompasses it...</b> This indicates that it does not stand far off, for if so, it would have no connection with what it produces, namely the Residue. Rather, it surrounds it. <b>...and it is said to include its power...</b> This means that it is the cause of and “includes” it in the way that a cause includes its effect. The Encompassing Light is the cause of the Vessel – namely, the Residue. The Encompassing Light is the ultimate revelation. The Vessel and the Residue contain the roots of man’s service, whereby we are able to attain the revelation, which is the reward. The Encompassing Light is thus the cause and goal of man’s service, the latter being the means, the Vessel.
<b>Part 3: Even so, all this occurs in such a way that the Line accommodates itself to the Residue.</b> Even though the light is <i>encompassing</i> light and is not limited by the vessel, it is not like Eyn Sof, Who encompasses everything yet is beyond all limitations. In the case of the Line, everything that enters into the Space accommodates itself entirely to the Residue. The Encompassing Light thus has a relationship with the Vessel. In other words, the Encompassing Light is also within the Space, unlike Eyn Sof, Who surrounds and encompasses the Vacated Space or Place from outside.
<b>Part 4: This is the Inner and Encompassing Light...</b> These are the names of two levels of the Light <b> …of the Sefirot, which is the underlying foundation of the Vessel.</b> Here we have the explanation of the Inner and Encompassing Light. Thus the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Raya Meheimna</i>, <i>Emor</i> 109b) states that “He is inside every Sefirah and outside every Sefirah”.
As discussed earlier, the action of the Line in governing the Residue through all the pathways discussed is itself in the mode of limitlessness – which is the mode of perfection. Thus every single level within the Residue is under the supervision of Eyn Sof in His intrinsic perfection, and these different parts exist only because it was His Will that they should exist. This is expressed by saying that Eyn Sof is found in every single Sefirah on every side, and the entire existence and functioning of the Sefirah is only through Him.
Thus the entire essence is Eyn Sof, blessed be He. Nevertheless, in every action that He executes for the sake of the created realms and beings, even those that are on their level, nothing is revealed of Him except the very smallest part – the Inner Light. However the Encompassing Light, while serving the created realms and entering into the Place created by the Tzimtzum, is not revealed. Anything man may understand about the works of the Creator is only a drop in the ocean.
Thus even though Eyn Sof looks down providentially and supervises the level of limitation, on which the lower realms and creatures receive, the greater part of His providence is too exalted for us. This is the Encompassing Light. The last part of the action is that aspect of His perfection that clothes itself in the executed work itself. However, even the level of perfection that we are able to understand as contained in the action executed by the Line within the Residue is nothing but the smallest part of that action. This is what stands to govern the visible Residue, whose measure corresponds to that small part.
Now this providence exists in several ways in each Sefirah – within it on all its different levels, these being called the Exterior, Interior and Intermediary Vessel. But the main light is the Encompassing Light outside. Both the Inner and Encompassing Light are divided into five levels, corresponding to the five levels of the soul: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Chayah and Yechidah. The Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah are clothed respectively in the Exterior, Intermediary and Inner Vessel, while the Chayah and Yechidah encompass the Vessel from the outside as Encompassing Light.
All these are called by their own individual names according to the way in which they spread and extend. The explanation of the spread of the Inner and Encompassing Light in the writings of the ARI relates only to Eyn Sof’s “looking down” over and providential supervision of the different levels in accordance with the laws of the Residue and its ordered levels.
In the vision this appears as lights made of perfectly wrought vessels, within and around which is the Light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, on the levels of Inner and Encompassing Light.

Chapter 29

<i>The Line shines within the Sefirot through a garb.</i>
<b>The Sefirot are what came forth from the Space brought into being at the time of the Tzimtzum. Each Sefirah is a part of the Residue. Within each Sefirah lies an inner essence that exists by virtue of the Line of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, which enters into it. The Line shines within the inner essence of each Sefirah as the soul of the souls, and in this aspect it is completely equal on all levels. However, the soul, which is the garb within which the Line is clothed, is made to match each Partzuf according to what it is, and this is what distinguishes the different Partzufim from one another. The difference is not in the Line but in its garb, which is the soul.</b>
<i>Having discussed the Line and the Residue in general terms, we must now examine the details and discuss how the Sefirot came into being.</i>
The proposition consists of four parts: <b>Part 1: The Sefirot are what came forth...</b> This explains the external structure of the Sefirot. <b>Part 2: Within each Sefirah…</b> This explains the inner essence of the Sefirot. <b>Part 3: The Line shines...</b> This is a level of interiority that is even more concealed.<b> Part 4: ...and in this aspect it is completely equal...</b> This explains the difference between the first and second levels of interiority.
<b>Part 1: The Sefirot are what came forth from the Space brought into being at the time of the Tzimtzum.</b> As explained earlier (Opening 26), it is this Space or Place that gives existence to what exists, and anything not already rooted in it cannot come into being afterwards. Accordingly, before this Place existed, nothing could exist. After this Place was produced, the Sefirot came forth, emerging in accordance with the nature of the Place. The Place is such that nothing exists except the Residue, for that was all that was left when the Place came into being. As discussed earlier (Opening 27), everything that could be revealed was already included in the Residue. If so, the Sefirot come only from the Residue.
<b>Each Sefirah is a part of the Residue.</b> The name Residue was applicable as long as no further action took place beyond the fact that this is what was left as a result of the Tzimtzum (see above, Opening 26, Part 1). In other words, before the Line began to activate the Residue, the latter was defined as being what remained of the light of Eyn Sof after the Tzimtzum – a Residue. Afterwards, the Line began to activate the Residue, and its various parts were structured and made into worlds and Partzufim, so that each Sefirah, wherever it may be, is one part of the Residue.
Clearly each Sefirah must be part of the Residue, because the Residue is the totality of all that is destined to exist in the Sefirot wherever they are. The Residue consists of the totality of everything as a single whole. In this aspect the Residue is therefore called only the root of what was destined to come afterwards, but the truth is that it is the totality of all that is destined to be. Everything that came afterwards is all only the details of the Residue. Every detail is part of the overall whole. If so, everything that exists in the Sefirot on every level is part of the Residue. Even though many different levels emerge later, this does not belie the fact that ultimately everything is rooted in and derives from the Residue. The various different levels could emerge only where we find them, but this is not a reason to say that they are not part of the supreme Residue, for as explained earlier, what was not initially included in the whole cannot exist afterwards as a detail.
<b>Part 2: Within each Sefirah lies an inner essence…</b> The inner essence (פנימיות, <i>pnimiyut</i>) is the “interiority” of the Sefirah. Within the Residue, everything follows the Likeness of Man, as will be explained at greater length below (Opening 31), and as discussed earlier (Opening 27) in terms of the soul and the body. This inner essence is the soul (נשמה, <i>neshamah</i>) of the Vessel, and within it is the soul of the soul, just as in the case of man – as will be discussed further below.
<b>...that exists by virtue of the Line of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, which enters into it.</b> For every connection between two things always generates an additional intermediary between them. The inner essence exists by virtue of the Line of Eyn Sof, because it was actually generated by the entry of the Line into the Residue. The truth is that when the Line entered into the Residue, a brilliant radiance shone from it, accommodating itself to the place it entered. This is the soul of the Vessel, and this soul is the underlying root of the individual mental powers (מוחין, <i>mochin</i>) that constitute the particular soul of each of the various Partzufim. For each Partzuf has its own unique mental powers depending on its level. These souls are all a garb for the Line of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, Who does not change in any place. The various mental powers are what each of the different Partzufim receives individually from the Line, but the Line itself is the same everywhere.
<b>Part 3: The Line shines within the inner essence of each Sefirah as the soul of the souls...</b> The shining of the Line within the inner essence corresponds to the concept of the “irrigation of the Tree” mentioned in various places in the <i>Zohar</i> (see <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i>, Second Introduction, 17, 1). The “irrigation of the Tree” is not the same as the mental powers, for these vary according to the individual structure of each Partzuf, as explained in the writings of the ARI.
<b>Part 4: ...and in this aspect it is completely equal on all levels.</b> This is necessarily the case, as it states in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i> 281a): “He does not change in any place”. This fact is obvious, for the Line constitutes the perfect action of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, in executing all the bounded laws of the Residue, as explained earlier (Opening 25). We may discern the same perfection in Keter, the highest of all the laws and Sefirot, just as in Malchut, which is the last. For everything that Eyn Sof does, small or great, He does to perfection. If so, the Line is the same on all levels. It is indeed fitting that Eyn Sof does not change at all, and that only the Sefirot change. This is because the Sefirot shine according to the readiness of the created realms and beings to receive. Since there are differences between the degree of readiness of different receivers, there are differences between the Sefirot. However, the Line of Eyn Sof shines in accordance with His perfection, and change is not applicable on this level.
This difference between the Line and the Sefirot is also seen in the soul and the body. The body is divided into different limbs and organs, and the nature of one limb is not like that of another. However, the soul is all one. We cannot say that the part of the soul in the nose is not the same as the part of the soul in the arm. The entire soul exists equally in every part of the body. It is only the actions of the soul that vary according to the bodily parts involved, but the entire body is governed by one and the same soul. This means that the soul governs all the different actions of the body without itself changing in any way. The Line is like the soul in the body, for as explained earlier, the various powers are divided up in the Residue like bodily limbs, but the Line governs it like the soul. If so, the Line must be the same on all levels.
These two ideas – that the Sefirot shine according to the readiness of the receivers, while the Line is like the soul in the body – are implicit in the <i>Zohar</i>. “The Master of the Universe deals with all the different creatures in each generation according to their deeds – just as the soul acts in accordance with each individual limb. Depending on the limb with which a man performs a mitzvah, the soul is said to have the corresponding attribute….” (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Pinchas</i> 256b).
A third distinction that must be made in this connection is between the root of the rule of unity (יחוד, <i>yichud</i>) and that of the rule of reward and punishment, which I have already discussed. The root of the rule of reward and punishment lies in the Sefirot, and since the rule of reward and punishment is responsive to men’s deeds, the Sefirot change accordingly. However, the rule of unity goes towards a single goal in every action with no change at all. This is the Line, which is equal on all levels. You must understand that the equality of the Line on all levels is absolute. For sometimes two things may be of equal value, or they may be equal in a certain aspect by virtue of which they are in the same position or come under one category. In some cases they may be completely equal. However, the equality of the Line is absolute on all levels, and this should be obvious from all the proofs we have adduced, because the action of the Line is literally equal on every level without any change at all.
<b>However, the soul, which is the garb within which the Line is clothed...</b> The garb (לבוש, <i>levush</i>, a “garment”, corresponding to the צלם, <i>tzelem</i>, “form” or “likeness”) is an intermediary between the soul and the body, relating to the body. When the soul clothes itself in this garb, it executes the necessary functions in accordance with the nature of the body, but when it is outside the body, it does not act in that way. This is the garb with which the Holy One, blessed be He, clothes the soul when it enters the body, and the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Mishpatim</i> 96b) explains that if it were not for this garb, the soul would have no connection whatever with the body. Prior to its entry into this world, the soul was like an angel without an evil inclination and without free will. However, on entry into the body, the soul became invested with an evil inclination and with free will. This is the result of its being clothed in this garb of the body.
Just as the garb of the soul affects the way it acts in the body, so too all the different garbs of the various Sefirot and Partzufim affect and change the action of the Line clothed within them in accordance with their particular nature. We find this idea in the statement in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Terumah</i> 139a) that bronze is a garment worn by the Indwelling Presence in order to give nourishment to the realm of the husks (קליפות, <i>kelipot</i>). Similarly, the <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> (<i>Tikkun</i> #22, 65a) states that “The clothes that He wears in the evening, He does not wear in the morning...”. For the essence is always one and the same, but He clothes Himself in different garbs and executes all His different actions according to the nature of these various garbs. We see this written explicitly: “And He wore righteousness as a coat of mail… and He put on garments of vengeance for clothing “ (Isaiah 59:17). Thus, when the Supreme Will wanted to bring in the Line to govern the Residue, which is as distant from Him as the body from the soul, an intermediary garment was needed between them, just as the soul needs an intermediary garment in order to connect with the body. It is through this garb that He does what He has to do in the Residue.
<b>...is made to match each Partzuf according to what it is...</b> Each Partzuf has its own distinctive “garb” depending on the governmental power which it needs to receive from the Line, which is equal on all levels. The Partzufim can only receive from the Line through this garment. If so, this garment must exist in each Partzuf according to its nature, in order that the Line may act equally through each one of these different garbs.
<b>...and this is what distinguishes the Partzufim from one another.</b> For all the different aspects of the Sefirot above correspond to the order of the Form of Adam, Man, as we find it here below in this world (as will be discussed later). For this form is rooted above on all levels. And just as we can make inferences from the Sefirot to add to our understanding of the Likeness of Man, so we can make inferences about the Sefirot from the Likeness of Man as we find it in this world, as will be discussed later. Now we see that all human bodies have the same general form. The differences between one person and another in terms of character traits, wisdom and intelligence lie in the soul. Similarly, the differences in one and the same person at different times and in all that pertains to the conduct of the body and its actions derive from the soul.
It is truly the same in the upper realms, and so you will find throughout the writings of the ARI and in all the teachings of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The fundamental concept involved here is that of the mental powers (מוחין, <i>mochin</i>): these are the inner essence (פנימיות, <i>pnimiyut</i>, the “soul”) of all the Partzufim. They are the source of all government, and each Partzuf is governed by its mental powers. These mental powers change in the Partzufim themselves at different times, thereby affecting and changing their nature and functioning, as I will explain to you below in its appropriate place. These mental powers are what we call the “garb” of this inner Line, which is the soul of the souls. It is through these different garbs that the Partzufim are distinguished from one another in all their various aspects, both qualitatively – whether they incline towards Kindness, Judgment or Mercy – and quantitatively, in terms of whether they are great or small in stature and value. For according to what they are, so they receive light from the Line garbed within them.
Thus: <b>The difference is not in the Line but in its garb, which is the soul.</b> For the difference between the Partzufim in terms of their stature could be seen as problematic, because it depends upon how close to or far away from Eyn Sof, blessed be He, they are. But since the Line of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, is completely equal on all levels, it would seem that they should all be equal in stature. However, as I have explained, although the Line is exactly the same, the garments are different, and each Partzuf receives from the Line according to the nature of the garb. Thus the Partzufim may be great or small depending on the readiness of the soul of any given Partzuf to receive from the Line within it.
From the discussion in this and the previous Openings, you should understand that there are three aspects to the Sefirot: (1) the vessels; (2) the mental powers; (3) the inner and encompassing lights. The vessels are the different levels of the Residue – the laws that exist after the concealment of perfection. Through the inner and encompassing lights, Eyn Sof is found on all the different levels. The mental powers are the garments (of the Line) and are made to suit each Partzuf depending on what it is. It is through these mental powers that Eyn Sof, blessed be He, connects with and governs each one according to its particular nature, as discussed above.
The mental powers include a Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, Chayah and Yechidah in their own right. The Chayah and Yechidah here are not the same as the encompassing lights of which we spoke in connection with the “inner and encompassing lights” (see Opening 28), for otherwise, various passages in the writings of the ARI would be completely contradictory. However, I will not expand on this now, because it is something that is quite evident in the passages which refer to the mental powers and those which refer to Eyn Sof, blessed be He, and the encompassing level. I have explained here the way to resolve the contradictions, and everything should therefore be clear. For the lights have their own individual way of spreading forth, and thus they reach the Partzufim in the same way as discussed there, be it in the “garb” of Wisdom or the “undershirt” of Understanding.
In the prophetic vision, the Partzufim thus appear with their mental powers together with the Line, which is the inner essence equal in all of them.

Chapter 30

<i>The rule of good and evil and the rule of unity</i>
<b>It was rooted in the Tzimtzum that the government of the universe should follow its course until the end. This means that flaws can exist, but in the end, everything will return to the final state of repair, when the true essence of God’s unity will be seen. In accordance with this pathway, the axiomatic law was instituted that would eventually bring about the formation of a realm of existence based on good and evil – “God made also this one against this one” (Ecclesiastes 7:14). This means that the entire array of the Sefirot was to unfold on all their levels with all that they generate, all with a view to bestowing good, while a created realm was to be brought into being that would involve every kind of defect and lack of goodness. This is called the Other Side. The intention is that the power to bestow good should gain sway, until every flaw returns to a state of repair, and then the true essence of God’s unity will be known.</b>
<i>Until this point we have discussed what happened when the path of limitation was first introduced and how it is bound up with the Unlimited. From this point on we will discuss how things developed thereafter, and how the totality of the Residue became divided into different parts in accordance with what had already been prepared. We will now discuss the first axiom of what developed, which is the overall law that governs everything that exists from here and below.</i>
The proposition consists of three parts: <b>Part 1: It was rooted in the Tzimtzum...</b> This explains what was embedded from the outset in this first act of Tzimtzum in accordance with what was destined to develop from it. <b>Part 2: In accordance with this pathway...</b> This explains what develops out of this root. <b>Part 3: The intention is...</b> This explains the purpose of all this.
<b>Part 1: It was rooted in the Tzimtzum that the government of the universe should follow its course until the end. This means that flaws can exist...</b>
You have already heard that the only intention of the wisdom of the Kabbalah is to understand the government of the Supreme Will and for what purpose He created all these different creatures, what He wants from them, what will come at the end of all the cycles of the universe, and how all these strange cycles are to be explained. For the Supreme Will Himself already calculated the entire cycle of government ending with complete perfection. When we speak about the Sefirot and the worlds, we are explaining these calculations and measures.
As you have already heard, the Tzimtzum was the first measurement calculated by the Supreme Will in order to create all His creatures. We have already called this the Place of all the worlds, and as we have also said, this Place is sufficient for the whole of existence. He therefore surely calculated from the very outset what this existence would be, and He made the Place accordingly, sufficient for all of it. This calculated measurement constitutes the pathway of boundaries and limits which, as already explained, was subsumed within Eyn Sof. Afterwards it came forth in the form of the Residue in this Place. The act of limitation, which made it possible for independent creatures to exist, is called the Place, while the revelation of the realm of limits – existence itself – is the Residue left from the Light of Eyn Sof.
Thus the first act was the formation of the Place brought about by the Tzimtzum. This Place was the first innovation produced when Eyn Sof, blessed be He, removed His limitlessness. This gave existence to the new pathway so that it could be revealed and operate. The pathway of limitation is the order underlying the course of the government of the universe. If so: <b>It was rooted in the Tzimtzum that the government of the universe should follow its course...</b>
There are two things that we must know here:
(1) Inasmuch as this Place is the root of the lower creations, we must understand what is the root of the Place itself. Let me explain: We cannot say that because Eyn Sof, blessed be He, created the universe in its present order, this is what He was able to create and He could not have made it in any other way. An example of such an argument would be to say that exactly so many worlds had to be created because the light of the first world was so great that it was impossible for the creatures to receive it. A similar argument is to say that a given thing was necessary because it would have been impossible without it. But we cannot say that Eyn Sof was, heaven forbid, forced to act in this way. We must understand that Eyn Sof is completely all-powerful, possessing every kind of power that the mind can and cannot grasp.
The end of the matter is that there is not a single limitation or other accident that we can possibly ascribe to Eyn Sof, blessed be He, except that He is the Master of all. The natural world that we see and experience with our eyes and other senses was made by Him just as it is, with all the sense perceptions to which it gives rise. But He is in no way subject to the limits of any order or law. Whenever we say that something would not have been possible without a certain given factor, what we mean is that, according to the way of gradation and measure, it would have been impossible otherwise (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Igulim VeYosher</i> 11b). Thus it is true to say that the way of gradation and measure made it impossible to bring forth the lower worlds directly from Adam Kadmon, for example, in order for them to receive this light. For according to the way we understand the nature of graded measure, it is not possible for a lowly creature to receive the light of the Supreme Keter. But all this is after we know that Eyn Sof wanted graded measure. If Eyn Sof had not wanted this, He could have done it any way He chose.
Accordingly, the first thing to be understood about the government of the worlds is that it depends on gradation and measure. This is the first foundation that Eyn Sof, blessed be He, willed, and the Place was made according to this will. The very fact of the Tzimtzum itself shows that He wanted gradation and measure, for if not, Eyn Sof, blessed be He, could have made the lowest of all creatures according to His will without any Tzimtzum whatever. On the contrary, the Tzimtzum is the first foundation of what we are explaining. Since He wanted to contract Himself in order to bring forth creatures, clearly He wanted to put the light on a level corresponding to what was to be born out of it. That is why He removed His limitlessness from here, bringing forth the Place that came forth – the pathway of government by gradation and measure, though certainly, if He had not contracted His light, He could have brought His creatures into being from elsewhere.
If so, we may say that the roots of graded, measured government lie in this Place. But that the Place of the created realms and beings should be one of gradation and measure, as opposed to one that follows some other pathway, is rooted in the Tzimtzum itself. On the basis of what we have explained here, you can understand that, had it not been for the Tzimtzum, even though this Place was included in Eyn Sof in potential, it would not have emerged in actuality. If so, the Tzimtzum was the cause of the Place, yet it could have come into being in some other manner.
(2) The second thing that we have to know derives from the first. This is that the degree of the actual Tzimtzum itself is what made the Place the way it is. What this means is that, even following the pathway of limitation, the world could have been made differently. For the All-Powerful certainly includes everything, and thus a variety of different possible kinds of places could have been brought into existence for the lower realms, all included in the All-Powerful. If so, only that which the All-Powerful wanted to leave from among all the different hypothetical possibilities actually remained as the Place made for the lower realms and beings. And how was it that this remained? That which He did not want to exist departed, including all these possible places that He did not actualize. If so, we may say that the Place that remained was determined by the measure of that which He removed. Had He removed more, the place would have been less than it is, yet the worlds would still have existed. Had He removed less, the worlds would have been greater, but they would still have existed. If so, it is the degree of the Tzimtzum that makes things go they way they go now.
If we seek a reason for this degree of Tzimtzum, we could answer: “And God saw all that He made, and behold it was very good” (Genesis 1:31) – we cannot speculate about this, for it is outside the bounds of our knowledge, as explained earlier (see Openings 14-15). Nevertheless, it is possible to give a satisfactory answer even to this, namely that the Supreme Will knew that turning evil back to good would only be applicable under a graded, measured order and not under some other kind of order.
<b>...that the government of the universe should follow its course until the end.</b> For under the present order, everything is based on choice, reward and punishment, with all the associated flaws and defects. This is certainly the result of the Tzimtzum, where the origins of strict judgment lie rooted. Afterwards Eyn Sof, blessed be He, will want to bring the evil back to good through the revelation of His unity. However you should not think that the latter is a new path that will come into existence only later. The underlying principle here is: “There is nothing at all new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). From the very outset everything was prepared in this way. Eyn Sof, blessed be He, calculated the entire governmental order the way it would truly be from beginning to end. Even though the repair itself appears to be the very opposite of the Tzimtzum and what resulted from it, the truth is that He calculated it this way from the very outset and produced the Tzimtzum accordingly.
<b>This means that flaws can exist...</b> This is bound up with the concealment of perfection that I have mentioned. Since Eyn Sof, blessed be He, is the ultimate perfection, it is quite impossible to ascribe any deficiency whatever to Him, for if there were any possible deficiency in Him, His perfection is sufficient to negate it. The negation of any possible deficiency is intrinsic to Him because of His axiomatic perfection.
However, His ability to negate any possible deficiency remained potential as long as there was never an actual deficiency that His perfection would have to negate. Until an actual deficiency came into existence, we would have had no clear knowledge at all of how that perfection operates to negate all deficiencies, for the light is only discernible out of darkness. As long as we do not know what deficiencies the darkness causes, it is impossible to know the good and perfection caused by the light. In order to demonstrate this clearly in actuality, it was necessary to produce a work in which perfection is invisible. Then all the deficiencies found within this concealment would become visible, so that with hindsight we can know the deficiencies which the primordial perfection negated.
This is the key to understanding the Sefirot as they appear within the Residue. The Sefirot constitute the governmental order of reward and punishment, and were made in accordance with the concealment of perfection. It is because of this that the flaws and defects exist in actuality, since they are contingent on the fact that the government is subject to the rule of strict judgment, and the bestowal of good hangs in the balance because there is a barrier which impedes it. This is not so in the case of perfection, which has no impediment whatever.
<b>...but in the end, everything will return to the final state of repair…</b> For the existence of flaws and defects when perfection is concealed provides clear and complete proof that perfection must be their remedy, since without the concealment of perfection they did not exist. Even now in the encompassing Eyn Sof – the place of perfection – they do not exist, while in the place from which He is concealed, they do exist. However, we must say that the knowledge of His perfection is still not complete. For although we have actually seen the flaws and defects and proved that His perfection is what rectifies them – since they do not exist in Him – we have not seen the actual repair and how it proceeds. Thus the intention is that flaws and defects should exist, as explained above, but that at the very end they should be brought back to a state of complete repair. In retrospect, His perfection will then be known completely.
<b>...the final state of repair...</b> Here is the answer to why the flaws and deficiencies continue for so long. Sometimes a state of repair is evident, after which things deteriorate and it turns out that perfection is still not visible. But the truth is that from the first days of the world, the wheel has been turning towards one point only: the final perfection that will eventually reign. So far this perfection has not reigned at any time or on any occasion. On the contrary, the way of the cycle is to come near to ruin, then near to repair, then after approaching repair, to return to destruction and deficiency. So far perfection has not arrived to do what is in its power. Only the final repair – which is the destined redemption, may it come soon in our days, and all that will follow in its wake – will be the complete revelation of perfection, when evil will revert to good. After this perfection, there will be no flaws or deficiencies, for the wheel will be at rest from its movement and the truth will have been clarified. From then on will be the time of delight: to delight in the truth that has been clearly manifested.
This is clearly proven by the fact that every time we thought the world was approaching a state of repair and that perfection was operating or starting to operate, the repair affected only Israel. But the nations of the world continued their rebellion, and the world remained in a state of ruin. There was still death, there was still impurity, and there was still an evil inclination. True perfection means there will be no more flaws and deficiencies, and everything will be rectified. Thus in time to come even the nations of the world will be rectified. The Bible explicitly states loud and clear: “On that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth” (Isaiah 19:24). “For then I will turn to the peoples a pure language...” (Zephaniah 3:9). Even the animals will be rectified: “And the wolf will dwell with the lamb…” (Isaiah 11:6). “They will not do evil and they will not destroy...” (ibid. v. 9). As for death: “He will consume death for ever” (ibid. 25:8). As for impurity: “I will remove the spirit of impurity from the earth” (Zechariah 13:2). As for the evil inclination: “And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh” (Ezekiel 36:26).
These are examples of the function of perfection, where evil itself reverts to good. However, all the earlier good times were caused by the function of the Sefirot in the mode of reward and punishment. In this mode, everything is evenly balanced. Either the Side of Holiness can hold sway over the Other Side, so that the Other Side is subdued and unable to cause harm, even though it does not actually revert to good but is tied up like a dog on a leash; or, Heaven forbid, the Other Side can hold sway and perpetrate the worst evils in its power.
In the good times, holiness held sway to such a degree that even though evil existed in the world, it was unable to act but was bound and subordinate. Only the generation of the wilderness at the giving of the Torah were on the path to the revelation of perfection through Moses, who was complete and was the embodiment of the inner essence, as explained in several passages in the <i>Zohar</i>. Accordingly it was said of that generation: “…the writing of God was <i>engraved</i> upon the tablets” (Exodus 32:16). The Hebrew word for “engraved” (חָרוּת, <i>charut)</i> may be read as “freedom” (חֵרוּת<i> cherut</i>), teaching that they were “free from the Angel of Death and free from servitude to the nations…” (<i>Eruvin</i> 54b; <i>Zohar</i> II, 46a, 114a).
Even so, it was not perfection itself that was functioning but rather the strongest force near to perfection: higher consciousness – the “mental powers” (מוחין, <i>mochin</i>) mentioned earlier. However, this too is considered part of the turning of the wheel. For the mental powers that are included as part of the cycle come very close to perfection and have great power to rectify things. This was the great power of the generation of the wilderness. The Torah given to them is on the level of the unity which stands guard even during the period of flaws and deficiencies, for if it were not so, the world would be destroyed, God forbid, and therefore the Torah was given once for all eternity.
However, this is not called the function of perfection but rather the function of concealment, which in any event does contain some aspect of God’s actual unity. This is why we said that the good times came about through the influence of these mental powers. For it is through the mystery of these mental powers that unity is to be found even in the time of concealment, because these mental powers are the force that is the strongest, nearest and most closely related to perfection. However, perfection itself will function only in time to come, when “Torah will come forth from with Me” (Isaiah 51:4) – meaning that a new level of Torah will come forth from God (see <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 13:3). This means that initially the only aspect of the Torah that was given was that which is bound up with the building of the cycle itself, a radiation of God’s unity to keep the world in existence. However, in time to come the Torah will be given from its supreme Source, which is the unity functioning as what it truly is in itself. For this reason, after this there will be no more flaws and deficiencies at all.
It could be objected: How can we say that the concealment itself contains some aspect of unity? Surely the purpose of the concealment was to manifest all possible deficiencies, and to show how they can all be completely rectified only through His perfection, in order that His perfection may be known in actuality rather than merely in potential. But if He wants to be revealed in some aspect within the concealment, this means that He does not allow the imperfections complete rein, with the result that in the final repair His perfection is not completely known.
The answer is that the concealment cannot make what certainly exists cease to exist. No matter how many flaws and defects you can think of, His existence, blessed be His Name, is intrinsically necessary. If so, it is impossible to conceive of any deficiencies except after the initial axiom that God certainly exists. All you can say is that He is concealed and that this is why the defects emerged, but His existence is a certainty. If so, even within the concealment itself, one thing remains enduring: His existence and the existence of His perfection – for they are one and the same. This is what sustains the world and prevents it from being destroyed, for any other existence besides Him is inconceivable. But God is perfect goodness. If so, it is inconceivable that there is any evil that is not in some way subject to perfect good.
This can be clearly proved. For if evil were in complete control without being subject to any other power, it would have to be called a domain in itself. However, since we know that the existence of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, is intrinsically necessary, there is no place at all for complete evil to be in control. Even if you think of all the evil in the world, it is impossible not to postulate the existence of a domain of goodness that necessarily exists and therefore holds sway over this evil. It follows that evil cannot gain total power to destroy the entire world. However, this necessary existence can be concealed as much as God wants. Yet His existence cannot be nullified, and it is therefore impossible for the world to be destroyed. Even within the concealment itself, His unity cannot be negated.
A further objection could be raised: If the Torah derives from the unity revealed even within the concealment, why was the Torah not given immediately as soon as the world was created? The answer to this is that the Torah which derives from the unity that exists necessarily even within the concealment is the Seven Commandments of the Children of Noah, which were given to Adam (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 56b). As for the knowledge of the Torah itself, there were Tzaddikim in every generation who had knowledge of the Torah (see <i>Yoma</i> 28b). However, this revelation of unity clearly does nothing more than prevent the world from being destroyed, but it allows the Other Side to perpetrate all the evil in its power. Nevertheless, this revelation can become even stronger, and therefore initially there were only seven commandments, for it is impossible for there to be less than this; but afterwards the revelation did indeed become stronger and the Torah was given.
To summarize: Everything that has happened until now derives from the turning of the wheel of reward and punishment under the government of the Sefirot, where either Kindness is dominant while Judgment is inactive, or the opposite, God forbid. Therefore either the Side of Holiness prevails and the Other Side is subdued but still remains evil, or God forbid the opposite. This is what Eyn Sof, blessed be He, wanted for the sole purpose of showing all the flaws and deficiencies that can exist – in order to show afterwards how they are all rectified. However, the final redemption – may it come quickly in our days – is brought about through the eventual function of perfection. The revelation of this perfection will rectify all the flaws and deficiencies that He wanted to be seen. For this reason, the perfection will be complete and there will be no more flaws and deficiencies afterwards. This is the meaning of the words of the <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> (<i>Tikkun</i> #70, 127a): “At the time when HaVaYaH rises up from the Throne of Judgment and from the Throne of Compassion, there will be no punishment or reward.” This will be when His unity is roused into action, but this is not the place to discuss this at length.
<b>...when the true essence of God’s unity will be seen.</b> As discussed already, the purpose of all this is to show clearly in actuality all that lies within the power of the supreme unity.
<b>Part 2: In accordance with this pathway...</b> As discussed earlier, the Place that came into being in all its aspects corresponds directly to the degree of the Tzimtzum. <b>...the axiomatic law was instituted...</b> This means that it was the rectification of the Residue to form worlds and structures that was prepared, and the rule of good and evil was instituted, as I will presently discuss.
<b>...that would eventually bring about the formation of a realm of existence based on good and evil...</b> What this means is that good and evil as such were not revealed there immediately but rather, that a certain path unfolded in such a way that eventually, the rule of good and evil emerges. Let me explain this whole matter: We know that there is such a thing as an opposite and something else that is divergent. What is truly evil is the Other Side and all that results from it, namely every kind of ruin. This is literally the opposite of perfection. On the other hand there is something which diverges from perfection and is incompatible with it but which is not its complete opposite. This applies to all those deficiencies which are not actually evil in themselves but which lead to a steady deterioration until evil emerges. However, as long as we have only a deficiency and not actual evil, we cannot call it the opposite.
You must now understand something that was introduced after the Tzimtzum: this is the Line of Measurement (קו המדה, <i>kav hamiddah</i>, also known as בוצינא דקרדוניתא, <i>boutzina d’kardunita</i>, the “torch of darkness”). This is the power to institute boundaries, which causes lack and deficiency. For the Tzimtzum brought into being something that did not exist at first – deficiency. Initially all was perfection, and it was only afterwards that deficiency emerged. Here we have the underlying power of Judgment, which was revealed through the Tzimtzum. This is the power that causes concealment, void and emptiness, bringing about every kind of deficiency that can possibly exist, as we actually find in reality.
Nevertheless, this did not immediately cause the worst possible deficiency, which is the opposite of perfection, as we said above. What it did was to cause deficiency after deficiency, gradually, stage by stage. Each one was a further divergence from perfection until finally, total deficiency emerged, the very opposite of perfection – the Other Side. Initially the power of Judgment caused only the slightest of all deficiencies, the first concealment, which was the concealment of perfection. Nevertheless, great light, abundance and illumination remained, and this is the ultimate that the most perfect of creatures can attain. Afterwards, the power of Judgment caused a greater concealment, leaving a weaker radiation than the first. So it went on, causing concealment after concealment. Each further concealment brought about new consequences. Even the second concealment did not cause actual evil and destruction but only a diminution of radiation. In this way things descended from level to level, with one concealment after another and one deficiency after another, until actual flaws appeared and then evil emerged, as will be discussed below.
Thus as soon as the Tzimtzum came about, it brought into existence this power to cause deficiencies, which would eventually produce evil. Indeed, this power was central in all the acts that followed the Tzimtzum, standing ready to descend and spread forth from level to level until actual evil emerged. However, since the intention was not only to produce evil, it did not immediately bring forth the evil that is the opposite of perfection. In fact, the intention was to produce good and evil together. For this is the difference between perfection and imperfection: perfection is entirely good, while imperfection can include good and evil. Perfection consists of nothing but perfection, while that which is deficient may involve many deficiencies, each one worse than the other.
If you think about it carefully, you will see that this comes from the fact that the opposite – total evil – was not brought into being at once. Initially there was only a certain concealment of perfection. What remained of the perfection that was not completely concealed was good, while what was lacking from the initial perfection was bad. With the first concealment, a great deal of the initial perfection remained, while the deficiency was minimal. We could even say that there was no actual deficiency but only a preparation that would eventually lead to the development of evil, inasmuch as there was now a state of concealment, whereas evil would not have developed from perfection at all. Thus, as stated earlier, there was as yet no deficiency but only a state of concealment. Afterwards a second concealment occurred, but even so, much of the initial perfection remained while the deficiency was still minor.
Thus it descended level by level. Each time, what remained of the initial perfection became less and less, for this is precisely what the concealment caused, until in the end, only a modicum of the initial perfection remained, while the deficiency was so great that actual evil started to develop. Nevertheless, what is able to emerge from it is only the beginning of evil. With further intensification of the concealment level by level, the deficiency eventually becomes so great that actual evil comes into being, this being the very opposite of perfection, as stated above.
Thus we find here two things that exist on all the different levels. The first is the Line of Measurement, which is what causes successive degrees of concealment. The second is the existence of good and evil, which are what is left of the initial perfection depending on the degree of the concealment and the extent of the deficiency. You must understand that the deficiency caused by the Tzimtzum is what is called the root of the roots of evil. In the end, when the deficiency becomes completely overwhelming, the result is that evil becomes manifest. Thus we see that the Tzimtzum is the root of the axiomatic law that eventually brings into being a realm based on good and evil. This law consists of what remains of the original perfection together with the deficiencies that came into being afterwards. What remained of the original perfection later brought forth the entire realm of holiness, which consists of the Sefirot in all their different aspects, while the deficiency brought about a new consequence, just as deficiency itself was an innovation. This new consequence is the Other Side, as we will discuss further below.
“God made also this one against this one” (Ecclesiastes 7:14). Not only was evil brought into being; it was made parallel to good so that through the fact that things are parallel, there would be a place for service, as will be explained in its proper place. This means that good was not automatically put in control, for then, even if evil existed in the world, it would have been subordinate to good. Instead, “God also made this one against this one” – with equal power, on corresponding levels and with equal ability to act. This way, everything that exists on the side of good has something against it on the side of evil which, if it acts in the world, can cancel out that good. Thus evil has the power to challenge good and not allow it any place to act unless it receives help from man in the lower world. This creates an actual path of service for man in making room for good and rejecting evil.
However there are three important initial differences between them, which later give rise to innumerable other differences. The first is that the Sefirot are the will of the Emanator, blessed be His Name, Who is the single, unified Master, whereas the Other Side is merely one creation which the Master made because He wanted it, as it says: “making peace and creating evil” (Isaiah 45:7). Thus evil is subordinate to the sole Master and dependent upon Him and is merely charged with carrying out His order because this is what He wills.
The second difference, which derives from the first, is that the power of the Sefirot was exactly calculated in accordance with God’s will. What this means is that the Master, blessed be He, does not want to act in any other way except this. However, had He wanted, and whenever He may want, He can increase their power according to His will. With the power they have at present, it appears that the Other Side can challenge them and prevent them from functioning. However, if Eyn Sof, blessed be He, had wanted, He could have increased the power of the Sefirot as much as He liked and the Other Side would no longer have the slightest ability to challenge the Holy Side. But compared to the power of the Sefirot, the power of the Other Side is truly limited. It only has what is in it now and it cannot in any way go outside its limit, even if it wanted.
The third difference is that the root of good was primordial and did not have to be brought into being as a new creation, while the root of the Other Side was an innovation. The root of the Other Side is deficiency, which came into being only after the Tzimtzum.
This provides the answer to what seems to be a major difficulty. For it appears that evil has two places while good has only one. Let me explain: If we were to interpret “also this one against this one” as referring to the good and evil in the Sefirot themselves – i.e. what remained of the initial perfection (good) and deficiency (evil) – we could justly call the Other Side the offshoot of evil (i.e. of the deficiencies), just as we call the Holy Side the offshoot of good. However, this is not the case. For we say that it is the Holy Side in its entirety and the Other Side in its entirety that are “this one against this one”.
And there is a strong reason why we have to say this. For besides the nations of the world and the angels of destruction, there is something else: the Ten Sefirot of the Husk, as explained in the <i>Zohar</i> in several places (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Pekudey</i>, 242a; 264b). Now against Israel and the ministering angels we can put the nations of the world and the angels of destruction, corresponding to perfection and deficiency. But to what can we say that the Ten Sefirot of the Husk are parallel? They are a root that was created for the sake of their offshoot – the nations of the world and the angels of destruction – whereas the Sefirot of Holiness are not a created root; they are God’s essential will and are therefore not parallel to the root of the Other Side. We cannot say that the Ten Sefirot of the Husk are parallel to the Ten Sefirot of the Holy Side, because it has already been stated above that the root of evil is the deficiencies in the Holy Sefirot. If so, what is the place of the Ten Sefirot of the Husk?
This problem is resolved because of the third difference that exists between the Holy Side and the Other Side, as explained above: the Holy Side did not require a new root, while the Other Side needed a new root to be made for it since it did not have one. Therefore all the deficiencies in the Sefirot are nothing but a newly created root for the Other Side, and what develops out of it is the Other Side itself. We thus have here two roots and two offshoots. The primordial root is the one, unified Master, blessed be He, besides Whom there is none other – Eyn Sof, blessed be He – and what unfolds from Him is the Sefirot. And with the unfolding of the Sefirot, the Supreme Will created a new root – the deficiencies in the Sefirot – to serve as the root for a different consequence, which is the Other Side with all that it involves.
Thus one cannot compare the Sefirot with their deficiencies, for the Sefirot are a branch and an extension of the primordial root, which is Eyn Sof, blessed be He, while the deficiencies in the Sefirot were newly brought into being to serve as the root of the Other Side. We can only compare offshoot with offshoot – the Holy Side, which is the offshoot of the primordial root, with the Other Side, which is the offshoot of the deficiencies willfully brought into being by the Supreme Will in order to reveal His perfection through their repair, as discussed above. This is why Israel are the true firstborn, for since their root lies in the primordial good, they preceded evil in the developmental chain, for the Holy Side always precedes the Other Side.
Now you can see how the Other Side emerged. Initially one light of holiness remained – the Residue, which is an extension of the primordial Root. However, this light contains a certain deficiency, and it is this deficiency that becomes the root of the Other Side. But this deficiency is not a branch parallel to that light of holiness – it is impossible to say that the deficiencies in the Sefirot are equivalent to the Sefirot themselves. This is because the deficiencies were newly brought into being to serve as the root of the Other Side. They are thus considered a root and not an extension, whereas the Sefirot are an extension of the primordial Eyn Sof. The deficiency in the light of the Residue is one root, from which the Other Side later emerges, a branch parallel to a branch. The Sefirot themselves are a branch of the primordial Root, while the deficiencies in the Sefirot are a new root from which the Other Side develops as a branch.
This is the reason why, as you will find later, the husks of the world of Atzilut face the Holy of Holies of Beriyah. For it is not possible for the branch constituted by the Other Side to face the branch of Holiness. For not just the branch (the Other Side itself) but even the root of that branch could not come into existence until after the holy branch, the Sefirot, were already there. The holy branch had a certain deficiency, and then out of this deficiency developed the root of the Other Side. And from this new root there later emerged the branch, the Ten Sefirot of the Husk – the Other Side.
<b>This means that the entire array of the Sefirot was to unfold...</b> Here we call all the Sefirot one side – the Holy Side – and the whole of the Other Side a different side, for the reason we have mentioned. For the power of Judgment and the root of evil that we have mentioned in relation to the Sefirot are all called one extension from the primordial Root, in accordance with the Tzimtzum willed by Him. All that we can discern is that the power of strict Judgment contained in the Sefirot is the newly instituted root of evil, because of the power of the deficiencies revealed through the Tzimtzum.
For when what remained of the primordial perfection was joined together with what newly came into being in the Tzimtzum, i.e. the power of deficiency – this produced the Sefirot. But this very power of deficiency itself came forth through the will of Eyn Sof, blessed be He. All that we can discern is that the Sefirot contain what exists by virtue of the primordial existence, which is entirely good, together with what exists on account of what came newly into being through the power of His will – deficiency, which is the root of evil. However, everything is one extension: what is left of the perfection together with the newly-created deficiency jointly constitute the Sefirot.
This innovation subsequently became the root of the Other Side, after which the Other Side itself emerged in parallel with the downward extension of the Sefirot. It is of these two parallel extensions, the Holy Side and the Other Side, that the verse says, “God made also this one against this one” – but always with the differences we discussed earlier. And the beginning of the Other Side is always lower than the end of the Holy Side. Thus it is written, “And God divided between the light and the darkness” (Genesis 1:4).
But as to the root of the Other Side in comparison with that of the Holy Side, it is almost forbidden even to ask if there is any equivalence between them (God forbid). For the root of the good is the one, unified, primordial, eternal Master, blessed be He and blessed be His Name for ever and ever. On the other hand, the root of the evil Other Side is merely something newly brought into being whose entire existence depends only on the fact that this is what was willed by the Supreme Will. Had He not willed it, it would not have existed, and if He did not want it, it would not endure. When He no longer wants it, it will no longer exist, but “He will consume death for ever and the Lord God will wipe the tears from all faces” (Isaiah 25:8).
<b>The entire array of the Sefirot was to unfold on all their levels...</b> This includes everything good that extends downwards in preparation for the needs of the lower creatures. This includes all that is necessary to benefit them as befits them according to their different levels (be they angels, men, inanimate, vegetable or animal), what is necessary in order to maintain them in existence (Sefirot in the form of circles, general providence), and what is necessary to benefit them according to their service (Sefirot in the straight, upright form, individual providence).
<b>...with all that they generate...</b> This refers to the separate creatures. For the Sefirot themselves consist of all the different measures and attributes of the Supreme Will. What they generate is what was created afterwards: the separate creation and the different offshoots of the Sefirot – the souls, the angels and all the creatures in the world. <b>…all with a view to bestowing good:</b> All this is called one continuation, because, whether small or great, they all constitute an orderly creation, each part according to its purpose. This is not so in the case of the Other Side, which is all a realm of destruction and ruin, which is why it is called the Other Side, as we will discuss below.
<b>…while a created realm was to be brought into being…</b> The Other Side is not like the Sefirot, which, being the attributes of the Supreme Will, are actual Godliness. This is not so in the case of the Other Side, which is a created realm brought forth by the Supreme Will just as He brought all the other creations into being out of nothingness.
<b>…that would involve every kind of defect and lack of goodness...</b> This is what is meant by the verse, “God made also this one against this one”. The intention was to make the good and to make everything that can be the opposite of good: every kind of damage and destruction. The many different levels of the Other Side correspond to all the many different kinds of damage and destruction that can exist when there is deficiency in the world.
<b>This is called the Other Side.</b> This is the name of this opposite realm. It is justly called the <i>Other</i> Side inasmuch as it is literally the opposite of the whole first extension we have discussed. Thus the creation was made with both intentions – that there should be a realm of existence and a realm of destruction, and we call them two sides.
<b>Part 3: . The intention is that the power to bestow good should gain sway, until every flaw returns to a state of repair.</b> This is the whole purpose of the Line that governs the Residue, as we have explained earlier. <b>…and then the true essence of God’s unity will be known.</b> The governmental order itself ensures that this is how everything will end – with total rectification. This is because of the superiority of good over evil, for good is primordial whereas evil is a new creation. The good is from the one and only Master, while evil is the Other Side, the angel of death, a created slave. This is why, given that there is a war between the Holy Side and the Other Side – good and evil – good must necessarily be victorious. But its victory will come about only because of the intrinsic superiority of good over evil. Through this, the truth of God’s unity will be known, because only by virtue of there being only one domain will everything eventually be rectified. For we see how the Supreme Will has allowed all the different kinds of damage found in the world to exist. And afterwards, at the end of everything, we know that His unity will be aroused and will rectify everything, as it says, “And I will remove the sin of that land on one day” (Zechariah 3:9).
The question could immediately be asked: Does the Holy One, blessed be He, want to rectify everything through man’s free will or through His own power? If you say He wants to rectify everything through man’s free will, how can it be that “from the beginning He tells the end” (Isaiah 46:10)? Surely, He knows the future, and since He knows that in the end they will need Him, should He not have rectified everything from the very outset?
The point is that Eyn Sof, blessed be He, wanted to remove from the hearts of His creatures the mistake of believing that there are two domains, one of which brings about good and the other evil. Accordingly He first laid down the Sefirot, in which He does not use His unity and perfect power. On the contrary, the power of the Sefirot is like the power of a strong man who submits himself to a test against a rival power – the Other Side – which the strong man himself put in possession of a power that is contrary to his own.
God has already shown how all kinds of power in the world, as long as they remain in the category of power alone without having ultimate control, cannot conquer the Other Side. On the contrary, the challenge of the Other Side is so great that it is impossible to escape from it without recognizing God’s unity. However, when His unity is aroused and He asserts His ultimate control, it will immediately become apparent that there is no place whatever for the Other Side. From this we will understand immediately that the Other Side does not possess eternal power in any way, and we will see God’s control and unity. Why? Because the Other Side contains every other power except for this. But in order to be a domain, it would have to have complete control. The Other Side is therefore not a domain but a subject slave possessing no power except what is given to it. While the power it is given is great, it does not have any control at all. For there is only one controlling Master, blessed be He and blessed be His Name for ever and ever.

Chapter 31

<big><strong>Adam Kadmon (Openings 31-35)</strong></big>
<i>The entire government of the universe is ordered under the four letters of the Name of HaVaYaH</i>
<b>The first order assumed by the emanated light, standing in the form of Ten Sefirot arranged in the Likeness of Man, is called Adam Kadmon. This is the order of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He for ever and ever. This means that all the different orders and laws are drawn after and come under the order of these four letters. In accordance with this order, the teachings of the Kabbalah always trace everything to the underlying foundation of the four letters of the Name, blessed be He.</b>
<i>Until now we have discussed the first foundations: the Residue and the Line and all that depends on them. We must now explain the structures that were built out of them in accordance with what was prepared in them.</i>
The proposition has three parts: <b>Part 1: The first order...</b> This explains the first order, which is called Adam Kadmon. <b>Part 2: This is the order...</b> This explains that this order is that of the Name, blessed be He. <b>Part 3: This means that...</b> This explains the meaning and purpose of this order.
<b>Part 1: The first order assumed by the emanated light...</b> As we have already discussed, the Residue existed initially only as the first root of all that would be created afterwards, standing as a general whole waiting to divide into its particulars. Indeed, many powers are found there, and thus the ARI stated that this emanation contains worlds without end (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Derushey Igulim VeYosher</i> 12:1).
To explain this further: The <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> states, “There is no angel that does not have within it the name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, and all the other names are considered attributes of this Name” (<i>Tikkun</i> 57 end). The <i>Zohar</i> states, “There are men who inherit three hundred and ten worlds, but it is impossible to ascribe any number to the worlds of the Master of the Universe” (<i>Pinchas</i> 257b). What this means is that although we usually speak only of four worlds, the truth is that there are worlds without number. This is because every complete governmental order consisting of an active source of influence (משפיע, <i>mashpia</i>) and a receiver (מקבל, <i>mekabel</i>) is called a “world” (עולם, <i>olam</i>), and is one complete system or “tree” of all the relevant sources of influence and receivers and their various orders and interconnections. There are very many such trees. Speaking generally, every name is a tree in itself, all of whose levels, influences and “chariots” (מרכבות, <i>merkavot</i> – governmental apparatus) are arranged in an order unique to itself.
These are the “worlds” which the Tzaddikim inherit. For example, with the emanation of Chochmah from Keter, three hundred and ten complete trees came into being (for Chochmah is <i>yesh me’ayin</i>, “existence out of nothingness”, and the letters of יש, <i>YeSh</i>, have the numerical value of 310). This is the secret of the three hundred and ten worlds of the Tzaddikim (<i>Uktzin</i>, 3:12; <i>Zohar loc. cit.</i>). In addition, there are the worlds of the souls, for each soul is a major root in the governmental order, and each soul has a tree of its own. This is the meaning of the statement in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that each Tzaddik has a world of his own – i.e. the Tzaddik himself is the world. One who attains only his own root takes his world. But one who attains everything receives the entire emanation of Chochmah, which consists of three hundred and ten worlds.
In every world there are different kinds of clothing (התלבשות, <i>hitlabshut</i>), states (מצבים, <i>matzavim</i>), coupling (זיווגים, <i>zivugim</i>), ascents (עליות, <i>aliyot</i>) and descents (ירידות, <i>yeridot</i>), depending on the nature and purpose of the world in question. The number of lights in the different worlds does not correspond directly to the number of the Ten Sefirot. Rather, each has its own particular number of lights, the sum being bound up with the nature of the given tree. Even the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, gives rise to seventy trees that are all completely different from one another: these are seventy “date palms”. (The word תמר, <i>tamar</i>, a date palm, has the connotation of תמורה, <i>temurah</i>, signifying exchange or substitution of letters or numbers.) However, the order of the Ten Sefirot in the form of the worlds of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah is called only one tree, as we will discuss further, with the help of God.
Now all these trees are in the Chariot below, but the root of all this lies above. For as the Line extended inside the Residue and formed orders within it so that the government would unfold properly from the first recipient to the last (for this is called a complete structure), the Line produced many different orders. These are all the attributes or forms of address (כינויים, <i>kinuyim</i>) that were revealed, such as “compassionate”, “gracious”, etc., for they were all revealed within the Residue. They all have different functions and are the root of different phenomena in this world. Each one is in the form of a tree in itself. All the many different great orders that make up the overall order of government were all rooted there, as we have said, each in the form of a tree in itself.
And then Eyn Sof, blessed be He, brought forth one order which He put in control of all of them, making all the other trees nothing but attributes, forms of address and garments with which to clothe this order. According to the way in which the different levels of this order are aroused, so all the other trees carry out their particular functions through this central Tree. This alone is what really acts, and it is only from here that the lower realms and creatures emerge and are governed, and their entire service is bound up with this alone. Note the phrasing of the passage from the <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> quoted earlier: “All the other names are <i>considered</i> attributes of this Name”. It does not say that they <i>are</i> attributes, but rather that they are considered as such – they are the equivalent of attributes. For each one is a tree in itself, but Eyn Sof, blessed be He, took them and made them a garment around this Tree.
This Tree of which we are speaking is the Tree of the four letters of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, which includes everything from the beginning of Adam Kadmon to the end of Asiyah in all the different aspects discussed in Kabbalistic literature. Standing around it like a garment are the various worlds we have mentioned. In themselves they do not act at all. Rather, they are like a garment in which the body is clothed: it is not the garment that acts but rather the body clothed in the garment. Similarly, this Tree acts through these garments around it. Just as the garment that clothes the active body part is included in the action, similarly the worlds surrounding whichever part of this Tree acts are also included in it. They are not there without purpose, for it is those in which the Actor is clothed that hold sway, while the Actor Himself acts in accordance with their power in executing their controlling functions. Yet it is only the Wearer of the garment who acts, not the garment itself.
Men’s service and all that they receive are bound up with this central Tree, the Name of HaVaYaH, which is garbed in the Partzufim. Afterwards they also attain the worlds in which this Name is clothed, for they inherit them as a matter of course when they inherit the One clothed in them.
As I have already said, this Tree extends from the head of Adam Kadmon to the end of Asiyah. In essence, this Tree is Adam Kadmon and the radiance that emanates from Him. For a glorious radiance came forth from Him, and the different parts of this radiance constitute the worlds of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. It is through these very worlds that He shows what exists above. Just as there are many kinds of worlds above with one central world inside them all, similarly, a single order is visible within the worlds of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. This is the order of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, standing in the form of Ten Sefirot, while many other orders stand in the form of the Chariot. These other orders are included in the four Chayot and their four faces and all the other aspects of the Chariot.
Each of these subsidiary orders is a world in itself, but the overall division follows the order of the Name of HaVaYaH. In other words, these worlds that I have mentioned constitute the Chariot in all its turns and pathways, while at the center of all of them is the order of the Ten Sefirot, which includes the whole of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. This constitutes the order of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, which is the essence, while all the others are His attributes or forms of address. And the truth is that even so, all this is called the order of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He. For everything that emerges from Adam Kadmon constitutes the order of the Name of HaVaYaH. This is like a picture or diagram of what exists above, showing how the Tree of the Name of HaVaYaH is at the center with the other attributes or forms of address surrounding it. These attributes that make up the Chariot are under the control of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He. In other words, the Chariot and its forms of address or attributes constitute Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, and there too this same order exists: the forms of address or attributes are many, but they are under the control of the Name of HaVaYaH, because they are His “garments”.
Accordingly, man’s essential service is bound up with the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, and the chariots themselves are subsumed under the overall order of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He. It is in the context of this order that they are called four Chayot (literally, “beasts”) together with all the other aspects mentioned in Ezekiel’s vision of the Chariot. This Name was placed in control of all the others because all the other trees are pathways of government according to the Residue that remained, while the underlying bond whereby all these things come to unity is the Tree of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He. Thereby the Cause of all causes reveals His unity and binds all the pathways of government into one pathway through which evil reverts to good. This is the order through which the Cause of all causes asserts His unity over all the different orders, joining them together in the mystery of that unity. On this level, as already discussed, there is no division between Kindness and Judgment, but everything is equally good.
This is what is meant by the teaching that “the Name HaVaYaH does not change in any place in its four letters...” (<i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> #57, 94b). What this means is that this Name, made up of its four interconnected letters, is only mentioned when the Cause of causes unifies all the different levels in the mystery of His unity. The Name of HaVaYaH “does not change” in the sense that the Name of HaVaYaH controls all the different levels in order to bring them into unity and to show that despite their various differences, they all serve only one purpose. This is to demonstrate His unity through the fact that He brings everything back to good.
This is the essence of the faith of Israel, which depends only on the Cause of all causes. Accordingly they have faith in Him despite the protracted exile, even though they see so much that is the opposite of the truth and face so many challenges from the Other Side. Yet through the power of His unity, they endure everything. Thus the above-quoted passage continues: “Because of this, the faith of Israel is centered on these four letters” – the four letters of the Name of HaVaYaH. Similarly, we find in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Vayera</i> 117a): “Rabbi Yose said to him, ‘Well spoken, because He is within the mystery of the letters [of the Name of HaVaYaH], and we should not get involved in other calculations of the end of time’.” It is perfectly evident from this passage that the Redemption depends upon the mystery of these letters. And the reason is that through these letters the Cause of all causes unifies all the different levels, and this is what the Redemption truly depends upon without any doubt at all.
What we learn from all this is that various orders of government exist relating to each and every thing, and many different kinds of worlds exist – whole worlds and whole trees, as discussed above. However, there is one order that lies at the root of the entire government and which governs all the other orders. This is the order of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He. This is the underlying order that exists within all the worlds of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. This order begins with Adam Kadmon, and what develops out of it is in Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah.
<b>...standing in the form of Ten Sefirot... </b>Even though all that exists is only Ten Sefirot, many individual aspects can be discerned within each and every Sefirah by itself – they are not all the same. Each one, depending on its individual purpose, has its own individual levels. Accordingly, all the other trees correspond to the individual levels of the various Sefirot, depending on the level from which any given tree derives. However, the Tree of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, is the mystery of all Ten Sefirot together for their collective purpose under the number ten.
In this aspect, we do not take into account the individual levels of the Sefirot. Rather, each Sefirah with all its levels is considered as only one, so that altogether they make exactly ten. The general pathway of all their arrangements or institutions (תיקונים, <i>tikkunim</i>, lit. “repairs”) depends on this number through the mystery of the return of evil to good. All man’s service depends on this matter of the Ten Sefirot, and therefore everything involved in the Sefirot is only on the basis of ten, with all that depends on this. Thus the Ten Sefirot are ten individual kinds of government, each different from the others, but the general law that brings them all together to serve one purpose is that of the overall Ten Sefirot that constitute Adam Kadmon.
It could be objected that the sum of a given number of particulars is not inherently bound up with their intrinsic essence but is merely contingent upon the fact that this many particulars together make up this number. If so, it would seem that the Tree of the Name of HaVaYaH, which is the order of the Ten Sefirot, would be of no consequence in the individual Sefirot themselves, and would not determine the quality of the Sefirot and of the details under it.
The answer to this objection is that the Ten Sefirot constitute the entire essence of the laws of government, yet at the same time the actual government emerges only from the particular way in which these laws are applied. Sometimes the government follows one law with all its particulars, sometimes a different law with all its particulars. Since each Sefirah is one law of government containing many individual details, depending on the quality of that Sefirah, the particulars are very many. However, there are times when we make general use of all the laws together in their entirety without taking account of the particulars. Thus all the Sefirot together enter into the overall government, which uses all of them together for the purpose of God’s unity, to bring the creation to the ultimate perfection. The significance of the number ten lies in the fact that here all the Sefirot are together for one purpose.<br> Thus there are two kinds of numbers: the individual number of each Sefirah, and the overall number of ten. When we follow the individual pathway of any given Sefirah, the number of lights will be whatever that particular Sefirah gives, and all the laws of government contained in those lights are in accordance with this. These are the trees that we have mentioned: each of the individual orders is called a tree. However, the overall action comes about through all the Ten Sefirot entering together in this quorum of ten, and the government is according to what this number gives in accordance with its intrinsic nature.
Quite the reverse of the objection: having seen that the law that there should be ten was laid down first, we may infer without doubt that this is the most general and necessary number. For they have to be this many, no less and no more, and arranged precisely in this order just as they are, in accordance with the number ten. All the individual details are automatically included in this number. And thus we may understand what each one of them causes and contributes as part of this general law, and we will understand the general repair that arises through this path in the proper way. Thus the number ten is not accidental: it is not by chance that the sum of all the particulars is the number ten. On the contrary, the number ten is the root of the overall government, which brings all the Sefirot to a common purpose.
<b>...arranged in the Likeness of Man...</b> The overall order goes not only on the basis of the number ten but on the basis of ten in all the orders of their different states and individual details. This is called the Likeness of Man (דמות אדם, <i>demut Adam</i>) – the number ten signifies the form in which man is made, which divides up on the basis of ten. For these orders can all be explained in accordance with the Likeness of Man, for they actually correspond to the human form in all its particulars. Indeed, they are the actual cause of the human form in all its particulars. They are even the cause of the very name Adam, inasmuch as they unfold in a certain order which is called Adam – the name of HaVaYaH in which the constituent letters are “filled” (spelled out in full) with alephs: יוד הא ואו הא = 45 = אדם, ADaM. This expansion of the Name consists of ten letters, yet they are all included in four, namely the four “simple” letters, which make ten when they are “filled”. It is through all these pathways that this Tree is understood in all its laws. And this first order in the Likeness of Man <b>...is called Adam Kadmon.</b>
<b>Part 2: This is the order of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He for ever and ever.</b> As I have written above in connection with the trees, this is the Tree of this holy Name. It continues unfolding in accordance with the intrinsic nature of its letters in the same order in which they appear in the Name in the mystery of ten and the mystery of four, as discussed above. As to the significance of the letters themselves: the Yud is Arich Anpin (the cusp) and Abba (the main body of the Yud); the first Heh is Imma; the Vav is Zeir Anpin and the second Heh is Nukva, in this order and in the mystery of the four expansions. The Yud corresponds to AV=72; the first Heh corresponds to SaG=63, the Vav to MaH=45 and the second Heh to BaN=52. (See Opening 22 Introductory Note.) In sum, all that exists is founded on the mystery of this Name and upon the mystery of these letters of which it consists.
<b>This means that all the different orders and laws are drawn after and come under the order of these four letters.</b> This is not one particular pathway but rather the general path, which includes everything that exists in the Sefirot in all their details and which brings everything under its order. For although the actions through which God governs the world are rooted in many different kinds of governmental pathways through the mystery of the various names, the actions are only actualized through this order of the four letters of HaVaYaH, which direct the other names and forms of address. Thus it is this order that directs all the various orders and is the root of all the actions that come about.
The governmental order of the four letters of HaVaYaH is built of various conditions and divisions: it is built of various names and forms of address, which constitute the details of the government. All are ordered in the proper order, for when they stand in the proper order, the actions go forth on all sides from the place from which they must emerge. This too is like the soul and the body: the other names are the limbs of the body, while this Name is like their soul, and the whole intention must be to hold by this soul so that it will actualize the actions of the body.
<b>In accordance with this order, the teachings of the Kabbalah always trace everything to the underlying foundation of the four letters of the Name, blessed be He.</b> This is a very important and necessary principle in the study of this wisdom, because we always speak in terms of the Ten Sefirot, yet there are many Kabbalistic teachings that appear to contradict one another. The main thing to understand is that the various levels divide up into many different ways and into many details depending on what is required for the action they have to execute. The division is not made on the basis of the Ten Sefirot in general but according to the particular nature of the action in question.
However, since everything must be included under the order of the Likeness of Man, which is the mystery of the Ten Sefirot, accordingly each division, as soon as it is made, is arranged in the order of Ten Sefirot. However this is not the basis of the division. The details of individual actions are arranged in accordance with their particular roots, yet at the same time they are also arranged in the order of the Ten Sefirot. This, however, is not the essential order of their individual actions, which depends upon their unique functions. Thus the division is based on other factors and on the relevant roots. Yet it is arranged in accordance with the order of the Ten Sefirot, which is the order of the four letters of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, and the four expansions of the Name, for it is all one matter, as we have already discussed.
From this you can understand that if those very lights themselves need to divide up in other ways different from the first division, those other divisions are also arranged according to the order of the Ten Sefirot, but they are then described differently. For example, what was at first under SaG can come under AV or under MaH or under BaN, for its appropriate place depends upon the division in question. (Thus the Nekudim are under BaN even though they are branches of SaG.)
The end of the matter is that since the order of the Name, blessed be He, is the general order that holds sway over all the different divisions and orders in the universe, we may infer that the actions have two roots. One lies on the particular level involved according to the individual root of the action in question. The other lies in the way they are arranged under the Name of HaVaYaH, which is their general root. These two roots are not at all parallel in their function. Rather, all the new divisions that come into being through the power of particular levels are all included in and come under this general order.
Let me give you an example. We say that the musical notes, vowels, crowns and letters correspond respectively to the four expansions of AV, SaG, MaH and BaN. This is not to say that they themselves actually come from there, for if that were so, various teachings, particularly in the works of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, would be completely contradictory and could only be reconciled with a forced solution. The main thing to understand is that there are four kinds of arrangements or institutions (תיקונים, <i>tikkunim</i>, lit. “repairs”). The letters are the actual lights of the government of Zeir and Nukva, which emerge from Imma. As to the vowels and the crowns: through the crowns (which are attached to the letters and written in the Torah scroll), Imma hovers over the letters as a source that remains attached to them even after their emergence. And through the vowels, Imma governs the letters, for the vowels govern the letters. The musical notes are institutions that come for the sake of complete government from the side of Chochmah (Abba). Once things are divided up in this division, they are immediately bound together under the order of the four expansions of the Name, as discussed above.
The same way of resolving apparent contradictions applies in the case of the lights of the ear, the nose, the mouth and the eyes. In one place it says that they are the four letters of the Name of HaVaYaH. According to this, the ear is Yud, the nose is Heh, the mouth is Vav and the eyes are the last Heh (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Ozen, Chotem, Peh</i> 4, 18a and <i>Derushey Nekudot</i> 8, 34b). <i> </i>Yet we find that the ear, nose and mouth are all only the first Heh of the Name, i.e. SaG (<i>Derushey Nekudot</i> 8, 34b). The apparent contradiction is resolved through understanding that the divisions are according to the need. Thus on the level of the particular, the ear-nose-mouth are the category of SaG, the first Heh. Yet all the different divisions are arranged under the order of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, and thus in general the ear, nose, mouth and eyes divide up according to the four letters of HaVaYaH.
We have thus now reached this order of the Likeness of Man. Everything we discuss from this point on follows the order that develops in accordance with what is inherent in this Adam Kadmon. We must therefore always speak in terms of the Likeness of Man. This is the basis for all the Kabbalistic teachings relating to the levels from Adam Kadmon onwards: the entire government is explained on the basis of the secret of the Likeness of Man. The Likeness of Man is the foundation of the government of the Universe.

Chapter 32

<i>The radiance of Adam Kadmon</i>
<b>The face is made to radiate that which is arranged within, inside the body, and emissions of this radiation emerge from each of the sense organs. Accordingly, four worlds emerge: the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech. The forehead also emits its own radiance. Thus all the worlds are nothing but the radiant splendor and shining glory of Adam Kadmon, while Adam Kadmon is more elevated than them and cannot be apprehended.</b>
<i>Having discussed the subject of Adam Kadmon in general, we will now start to go into the details, following the order of the Likeness of Man – the human form. We begin by discussing a phenomenon that we must first examine as it is manifested in the human form itself, in order to be able afterwards to understand the government of the worlds in accordance with the underlying secret of this phenomenon.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: The face is made to radiate...</b> This is the phenomenon that we must understand as manifested in the human form, namely, the face. <b>Part 2: Thus all the worlds...</b> This is the underlying secret corresponding to this phenomenon in the scheme of the worlds.
<b>Part 1: The face is made to radiate...</b> To explain this matter: The parts of the body and their functions here below always signify parallel aspects of the government above. The face exists as one part of the body through which the soul (נשמה, <i>neshamah</i>) turns to and supervises what concerns the body in relation to that which is outside of it, through the faculties of vision, hearing, smell and speech. The soul remains in its sanctuary and through these organs experiences all these sensations.
There are two things that we must consider here: the fact of the existence of the apertures (נקבים, <i>nekavim</i>) found in the face, and the use that the soul itself makes of them. The truth is that the apertures themselves are made by the soul. When the body of the embryo is being formed, the spirit (רוח, <i>ruach</i>) that builds it breaks through so as to form the aperture, whereas in the other limbs and body parts the spirit remains inside. Afterwards, sensory experience comes about through these apertures. However, this breaking through by the soul is not dependent on the senses themselves, for there are cases where a person has a given organ but not the associated sense. Furthermore, a person does not constantly hear, smell or speak even though these apertures are open.
Up to this point we have been considering the apertures through which the soul supervises that which relates to the outside. Another phenomenon is that of the face itself (i.e. the facial expression), which also shows the state of the inner spirit in its place, be it settled or agitated. It must be that the face was intentionally made to do this, for the other limbs of the body do not do so. There is also something else that is not visible today but which ought to be able to be seen: the face should have a shine or radiant splendor (זיו, <i>ziv</i>) like that of the sun. This was seen in the case of Moses our Teacher, the very skin of whose face radiated (Exodus 34:29). Similarly, the sages said of Pinchas that when the Holy Spirit rested upon him, his face flashed like lightning (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 1:1). The reason why this radiant splendor is not seen today is that man’s face is incomplete after the sin of Adam. However, initially Adam had this radiant splendor, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Bereishit</i> 142b) and Midrashim. In the future too, all will shine with this splendor, as it is written: “And they that are wise shall radiate splendor like the splendor of the firmament” (Daniel 12:3).
From all of the above, we see that the face is made to turn to others, and the face is prepared for this. We can discern three different aspects. The first is the face itself, ready in all its parts to shine forth and radiate the inner light of the soul and show it to the outside through the expression of the face and its radiant splendor. Secondly there are the apertures made by the breaking through of the spirit during the process of building the body. Thirdly, there are the sensory experiences of the soul through these apertures.
Let us now consider how all this applies above: The “face” consists of the vessels in the Residue through which the Light of Eyn Sof – the “soul” within – turns to others so as to govern the Partzufim themselves, which constitute the orders of government of the worlds. For you have already heard that just as the soul governs the body, so the Inner Essence (פנימיות, <i>pnimiyut</i>) governs the Partzufim (see Opening 29). These vessels are the “face” with all that is instituted in it through the mystery of the Thirteen Rectifications of the Beard, which comprise the entire face. (In Adam Kadmon, the Thirteen Rectifications are not present as such, but their roots are there.) These all shine and produce the radiant splendor of the face. Nevertheless, the radiance is occluded, for it has to pass through the face itself. Even so, everything that is arranged in the entire body can be seen in the face, for things are so ordered that everything connected with the soul is visible in the face, as discussed in the <i>Zohar</i> in connection with the secrets of physiognomy (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Yitro</i> and <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i>). Thus the soul causes the face to shine with radiant splendor, and this is the mystery of the 370 and 150 Lights of the Face (<i>Idra Rabba</i>, <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Naso</i> 128b), indicating the government of Arich Anpin and Zeir Anpin respectively. Afterwards, having been included there in a general way, the soul flashes and breaks through to make four apertures: the eyes, the ears, the nose and the mouth.
Understand what these fissures (בקיעות, <i>bekiyot</i> “breakthroughs”) signify above. It is not that they broke through once and went out. Here below as well, if the radiant splendor were visible, we would see how the aspect of the soul that is already included in the face to show the state of the soul emits a continuous shine of radiant splendor that breaks through and goes out literally through these apertures. However, now that the radiant splendor has been concealed, its only visible action is to break through to produce these apertures. And because it comes from the soul, which is now concealed, just as the radiant splendor is not visible on the face, so too what emerges from these fissures and apertures is also not visible. Quite the contrary: on the face there is at any rate the visible facial expression, for the soul has a certain garb, namely the face itself. But coming through the apertures we see nothing at all, because the soul goes out with no garb at all.
Note the great difference between the radiant splendor visible on the face and what passes out through the apertures. What is visible on the face gives a comprehensive expression of all the different aspects of the soul. But emerging through the apertures are individual aspects depending in each case on the place from which they come forth. These aspects prepare what is necessary for providence through the mystery of vision, hearing, smell and speech.
Afterwards these fissures with the lights that are in them become the “senses”. These are the actual government, inasmuch as the soul uses these emerging lights in order to supervise properly. However, the root of providence is itself traced in accordance with the function of each of the different senses to the very interior of Adam Kadmon, which we are not talking about. What we are talking about now is what breaks through and goes out in order to produce the apertures and also the senses. This forms a second radiant splendor that covers the radiant splendor of the actual face itself. Accordingly, the Kabbalistic masters stated that this second glow is drawn forth against the face but is not directly attached to the face (for only the first radiant splendor, that of the face itself, is directly attached to it). All this would be visible if the radiant splendor were visible.
Thus we find that the inner soul is hidden within the body and is not seen at all. Afterwards, it is seen through the expression of the face, and the radiant splendor starts – this is the first or “inner” radiant splendor. While the soul is still there, it gains force and breaks through and is actually seen through these four fissures. It is from there that a second radiant splendor comes forth and stands over the first, “inner” radiant splendor of the face, which is thus like a glow within a glow. It is from this second radiant splendor that the senses exist through the power of the movement of the soul within that splendor. But the fact that the radiant splendor exists on the outside is because the soul broke through to make the holes.
Clearly, if the soul produced four faculties, all different from each other, no less and no more, this must have come about through the power contained within it, which was able to bring this forth, no less and no more. If so, the action that the soul performs through one fissure is different from the action it performs through a different fissure. Accordingly, hearing is rooted in one fissure, vision in another, smell in another and speech in yet another. The truth is that according to the powers contained in the inner soul, so it was that through one power the soul was drawn to one of the organs suited and ready for that power to function, and the soul broke through it and went out. Through a different inherent power, the soul was drawn to a different organ, and broke through it and went out. Thus the <i>Otzrot Chaim</i> states: “But the wise will understand that the light of the brain is called AV, while the light of the ear is called SaG...” (<i>Gate of TaNTA</i>, end of ch. 2, gloss).
In summary: the soul is made to shine in the face and also to break through and go out completely with no barrier before it in order to operate the senses. Moreover, it is actually through standing and shining in the face that the soul breaks through to form these fissures for the senses. Thus the face consists of vessels ready for two things. The face itself is made to emit its radiation even while this is still within the vessels (before breaking through). On the other hand, the fissures or apertures of the senses are there to give the soul a place to exercise its control and to supervise. Even as the soul stands in its place, it is seen through the fissures that it made initially, and it then produces the second glow. This consists of what was visible in a general way in the first radiant splendor but which is now seen in its particulars through these fissures. What is seen of the soul through each one depends on the nature of the particular fissure through which the soul is seen. All this is besides the actual senses themselves. For even though they are produced in these very fissures, the truth is that they are made within this general radiant splendor, each one through the power of a different movement made by the soul according to the law governing the quality of its different senses.
As to what is visible of the soul on the face, we have already said that this expresses the overall state of the soul, and it is from this aspect that the fissures we have discussed emerge. Accordingly, we may make inferences from the radiant splendor that emerges and becomes visible through these fissures (the second glow) as to what exists in the face itself in the mystery of the first, “inner” radiant splendor that I mentioned. And from this radiant splendor of the face, we may make inferences as to what is contained within the body – the soul itself, its state and purpose.
If you examine the matter carefully you will find that the government is concealed within the heart and in all the body and is revealed in the face, and from there it is revealed through the fissures. The last revelation is thus the radiant splendor emerging through the fissures, and it is with this that we are concerned in our studies of the Kabbalah. For this is the light that reaches <i>us</i> and it is only this that we are truly able to apprehend. All that is more interior than this is too elevated for us and we cannot know it. The details of this radiant splendor constitute all the worlds in their various aspects. For only the parts of this radiant splendor and its movements are revealed to us and no more. All we know is that this whole matter is rooted deep, deep within the interior of the supreme government.
From this you can understand the low level of the knowledge that created beings are capable of attaining, for the true nature of the government is exalted far above them, and they know nothing except the superficial level closest to them. This external level contains the complete cycle of government in its entirety from the beginning until the end and all the worlds that we will be discussing.
Indeed, one principle that you must constantly bear in mind is that everything done in any given place is done in accordance with that place. To take an example from the subject of our present discussion: what is seen of the soul through the face is ordered in a way suited to this visibility, and similarly, what is revealed through the fissures made by the soul is arranged in an order suited to this revelation. This is the order that it is possible for the creatures in the lower realms to apprehend. This means that they see only the outermost aspect of the measure laid down for the government of the worlds. Even so, what they see is the truth of the matter according to the way it is in depth. However, the intellect is inadequate to apprehend the entire matter in its true inner essence and depth and to encompass all that exists there. Accordingly, we say they were given a complete and sufficient picture to enable them to understand the matter to the extent to which they are able to receive.
This can be compared to the case of a sage who wants to teach his wisdom to his student. If the student is unable to receive the full depth of this wisdom, the teacher gives him enough of a picture of this wisdom as he is fit to receive. The picture is faithful to the full depth of the sage’s wisdom, yet it is concise and comprehensible to the student. If he later enters into the depth of this wisdom, he will find even greater benefit in it than he could have thought possible at the outset, “like the superiority of the light that comes out of the darkness” (Ecclesiastes 2:13).
It could be objected: We said earlier that the government lies in the Residue while the Line is concealed within it (see Opening 27). But from our present discussion it appears that on the contrary, the entire government derives from the Line, for we see that the government comes about only through what emerges from these apertures, which is from the interior, which is the Line. If so, surely the government is from the Line.
This may be answered as follows. What is revealed cannot be said to be revealed in accordance with the level of the soul. On the contrary, we must say that it is revealed according to the level of the body. This is because man is made up of a soul clothed within a body built of apertures and cavities: the cavities are container vessels while the apertures are vessels of exit. The soul fills the container vessels while emitting light through the exit vessels. All this is in accordance with the way the body works and the nature of its vessels. When the soul goes out through these exit vessels, it makes a radiant splendor around the body. The soul adds nothing to the body, which remains as it is. For even when the soul brings forth its lights, it brings them forth only in accordance with the nature of the body. This is the implication of the above-quoted passage from <i>Otzrot Chaim</i> stating that “the light of the brain is called AV, while the light of the ear is called SaG”. However, the vessels that bring forth the light exist only to reveal what takes place inside the container vessels. Thus the <i>root</i> of the government lies in the interconnection of the soul and the body inside, but the government is <i>revealed</i> in the face, and then an even greater revelation comes in the radiant splendor emerging from the fissures with all that is revealed there.
Accordingly, the Line governs on its own level, which is different from that of the Residue, whose government is subject to it. For I have already stated that the soul brings forth its lights in accordance with the body. Thus when we consider the overall order of government – the entire structure of Adam Kadmon – we find that the full cycle of the government as it is revealed to us consists only of what is revealed after the Line has already clothed itself within the Residue through the surrounding radiant splendor. Besides what is revealed through this radiant splendor, everything the Line does in clothing itself in the Residue is unknown to us.
<b>...that which is arranged within, inside the body...</b> What is revealed is the actual order that exists within. Accordingly there is a direct parallel between what is revealed and that which exists within. Indeed, we can tell in detail which part of the interior is revealed in one place in the face and which part in a different place.
<b>...and emissions of this radiance emerge from each of the sense organs...</b> This is as we have said above, that what radiates initially in the face in a general way emerges in a more revealed manner in the sensory faculties. <b>Accordingly, four worlds emerge: the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech.</b> Since there are four faculties, four things emerge and are revealed from them. Indeed, all that is fit to be revealed will be revealed through these four. For this reason there are four and no more: <b>the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech.</b> These are not the actual vision, hearing, smell and speech themselves, but their worlds – what emerges from them.
<b>The forehead also emits its own radiance.</b> This too is something that is not seen now, but which would be visible if the radiant splendor of the forehead were visible in the same way as the radiant splendor of the other senses. For there is a very subtle fissure, and this is the secret of the Tefilin which stand on the forehead. Of the Tefilin, it is written: “And all the peoples of the earth will see that the Name of HaVaYaH is called upon you” (Deuteronomy 28:10).
<b>Part 2: Thus all the worlds are nothing but the radiant splendor...</b> As already stated in the commentary on the first part of the proposition, all the worlds discussed in the Kabbalah are levels of this radiant splendor. <b>...and shining glory of Adam Kadmon...</b> Shine and radiation are the appropriate terms for that which is not the essence of a thing itself but which shines and radiates from the essence. The radiation is on a lower level than the essence itself. These worlds are thus a mere radiation that emerges from Adam Kadmon. They do not reveal all that is revealed in Adam Kadmon in itself but much less.
Here lies the answer to an apparent difficulty about these worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech, which appear not to follow the order of the rest of the Tree. The world of Beriyah, for example, emerges from Atzilut in the sense of being a single continuation of it, emerging like a seal stamped with all the Sefirot of Atzilut, which pass through a screen. Each Sefirah in Atzilut actually brings forth the corresponding Sefirah in Beriyah. Yetzirah emerges from Beriyah in the same way, and similarly Asiyah from Yetzirah. It is therefore fair to say that they are one under the other, for they emerge one from the other. Similarly in the case of the Partzufim: Abba and Imma emerge from Arich Anpin through the process of internal coupling (זיווג, <i>zivug</i>) within, while Zeir Anpin and Nukva emerge from Abba and Imma through their coupling. This is not the way in which the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech emerge from Adam Kadmon. Rather, these emerge from within through the sensory organs.
This gives rise to two difficulties. The first is that we cannot say that the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech are <i>under</i> Adam Kadmon in the way that Abba and Imma, Zeir Anpin and Nukva are under Arich Anpin, as mentioned elsewhere. For the former do not emerge from Adam Kadmon in the same way that the latter emerge from Arich Anpin through the process of coupling whereby the higher Partzuf brings forth the lower one. The second difficulty is that the emergence of the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech from Adam Kadmon seems inconsistent with the developmental mode (השתלשלות, <i>hishtalshelut</i>). This requires that first one world should be completed, after which another world should emerge from it on the next level and with a power less than that of the higher world. This is the pathway visible in the Sefirot from after the Tzimtzum onwards, but the emergence of the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech seems to follow a different pathway that is inconsistent with this order.
The question immediately arises as to why these worlds did not emerge from and come under Adam Kadmon in exactly the same way as the other worlds emerge one from another. Or if these emerged in this way, why did others not emerge from Adam Kadmon in the way that Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah emerged from Atzilut? In short, we do not see here a direct continuation as would have been appropriate in accordance with the developmental pathway. Rather it seems like a jump from one pathway to another and from one aspect to another. We do not see a single, complete, consistent order binding everything together in this way at all.
These difficulties may be resolved in the light of our earlier discussion. It is true that contained within the Empty Space formed through the Tzimtzum is only one overall existence: this is Adam Kadmon complete in all aspects – soul, body and radiant splendor. This constitutes the entire government of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He, besides which nothing else exists. However, inasmuch as this government is very deep, we cannot understand it, and only a glimmer is revealed to us. (This answers the first objection – that the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech are not “under” Adam Kadmon – for they are a <i>part</i> of Adam Kadmon.) This glimmer is the smallest, most concise picture of this government. This alone is what we can speak about in Adam Kadmon. It is here that we can distinguish the different levels, one under the other, in a developmental chain. These are the different aspects of the revealed government. However, the revealed government does not emerge as a continuous gradation that develops out of Adam Kadmon. Rather, this is all that can be revealed of Adam Kadmon, and we must consider this to be also part of Adam Kadmon. (This answers the second difficulty – that these worlds do not develop out of Adam Kadmon but rather are of and in Adam Kadmon.) We can only say that Adam Kadmon constitutes all that exists in accordance with the order of the Name of HaVaYaH, blessed be He. The intrinsic essence of Adam Kadmon cannot be apprehended. It is only the radiation of Adam Kadmon that can be apprehended, and this contains all the levels and aspects discussed in the teachings of the Kabbalah.
<b>...while Adam Kadmon is more elevated than them and cannot be apprehended.</b> This explains why we do not occupy ourselves with the intrinsic essence of Adam Kadmon but instead speak in terms of these worlds. What this means, as discussed above, is that Adam Kadmon is the concealed source of the government, while the radiant splendor is what is revealed of Adam Kadmon. This is not a confused order, nor does it jump from path to path. On the contrary, it is a fitting order and one that is properly arranged.
The way this appears in the prophetic vision is as written in the Kabbalistic texts: there is a single Partzuf or visage (that of Adam Kadmon) whose face radiates. Emerging from it are all these lights in the order given in the texts.

Chapter 33

<i>The branches of Adam Kadmon successively reveal the Likeness of Man.</i>
<b>AV, SaG, MaH and BaN are revealed from Adam Kadmon. AV corresponds to the Chochmah of Adam Kadmon and what exists here does not come within our grasp. It sends forth its light by way of the hairs of the head, through which the brain reveals its contents while itself remaining concealed. But SaG reveals the lights that are concealed in AV, and this is the emanation that constitutes Atzilut, which little by little becomes increasingly revealed. Accordingly, the inner light and encompassing light are initially far from one another, but they steadily come closer together, little by little, until they reach the mouth, where a Vessel is made. There the Likeness of Man is properly rooted, and this is the aspect of MaH and BaN that is revealed afterwards.</b>
<i>Having discussed in general terms how radiations of light emerge from Adam Kadmon, we must now explain the details.</i>
The proposition has three parts. <b>Part 1: AV, SaG, MaH and BaN...</b> This is what is revealed overall. <b>Part 2: AV corresponds to the Chochmah...</b> This discusses AV in particular. <b>Part 3: But SaG...</b> This discusses SaG in particular.
<b>Part 1: AV, SaG, MaH and BaN are revealed from Adam Kadmon.</b> For you have already heard that all that exists in all the different orders of the body is revealed in the face. And what is revealed in the face is revealed through the apertures, the fissures through which the soul breaks through. Now everything in the entire body consists of AV, SaG, MaH and BaN. If so, that which is revealed is AV, SaG, MaH and BaN.
<b>Part 2: AV corresponds to the Chochmah of Adam Kadmon...</b> The underlying secret of Chochmah (חכמה, “wisdom”) and Binah (בינה, “understanding”) is that Chochmah is how things are arranged in the depth of the mind (מחשבה, <i>machshavah</i>, lit. “thought”), but Binah constantly reveals the hidden mysteries of Chochmah. AV corresponds to the picture formed in the depth of the mind of Adam Kadmon. <b>...and what exists here does not come within our grasp.</b> For the nature of Chochmah is to be hidden and concealed.
<b>It sends forth its light by way of the hairs of the head...</b> The hairs of the head are the first radiant splendor: this is comparable to the beard, which is the first radiant splendor of the face, as discussed in the previous Opening. It is from the hairs of the head that the light of AV goes out as a second radiant splendor, comparable to the second radiant splendor discussed in the case of the face. <b>...through which the brain reveals its contents...</b> The secret of the hairs, in every place they are found, is that they are connected with what is arranged within the brain inside the head. This is revealed outside, on the head, in the category of “hairs”. (The letters of the Hebrew word <i>sei’ar</i>, a “hair”, are the same as those of <i>shaar</i>, a “gateway” and the root <i>sha’er</i>, “form a mental estimate”.) Everything bound up with the hairs and all of their laws are in accordance with the nature of the brain as it is inside. This will be explained further in the appropriate place (Opening 105). <b>...while itself remaining concealed.</b> The light of AV that emerges is concealed, since it corresponds to Chochmah, whose nature is to be concealed.
<b>Part 3: But SaG reveals the lights...</b> This is Binah, which, as I have said, reveals the lights of Chochmah that are occluded <b>...that are concealed in AV...</b> For the lights of SaG are not other lights that did not develop out of AV. If that were the case, AV would be a separate aspect by itself, marked by the fact that its actions and effects are not revealed, while the lights of SaG would be a quite different aspect, since their effects are revealed. If this were so, we would face the problem of disconnected scatteredness. This is the apparent “jumping” that I discussed earlier (Opening 32), where you start with one aspect and then, before knowing where it leads, jump to another having no connection with the first. You cannot say such a thing, because this would not be knowledge but bewilderment. The proper way, if these lights that we are discussing are the lights of government, is that they should follow a developmental sequence, one after the other, from beginning to end.
The truth is that all the levels discussed in the Kabbalah, from the beginning of Adam Kadmon to the very end of Asiyah, are all bound up with each other and develop one from another. The difference between them is that every higher level is more concealed than the level below it, such that things move from a state of concealment to one of revelation, but all are one interconnected chain. Thus all that is revealed afterwards in the form of the lights of SaG is what was initially concealed in the light of AV. The lights of SaG themselves are not a multitude of scattered, unconnected aspects. They constitute a single whole that steadily becomes increasingly revealed, stage by stage.
<b>...and this is the emanation that constitutes Atzilut.</b> For the intention from the very outset was to bring into being the root of the Likeness of Man in a way closely relating to the lower creatures, so that it should serve as the root for their service. This root is the emanation that constitutes Atzilut, which is built of MaH and BaN after they were joined together. For the lights there are the actual causes of all the different aspects of This World, being close to them and related to them in a fitting way, which was not the case on the earlier levels (the lights of AV and SaG), which constitute only the <i>root</i> of these actual, direct causes.
You will be able to understand this through what I have already said in connection with the successive concealments produced by the Line of Measurement: each successive degree of concealment causes new effects according to the concealment in question (see Opening 30, Part 2). The Likeness of Man could only emerge in this way in its various aspects following this gradation and a succession of increasing degrees of concealment, until they reached the level called Atzilut, but not above this. Thus Rabbi Chaim Vital wrote that even though we use the terms “ear” and “eyes” in the case of Adam Kadmon, this is only to “break through” and make sense to the human ear – to give us a faint indication of something that is intrinsically beyond our grasp (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Ozen, Chotem, Peh</i> ch. 1, p.34a, <i>TaNTA</i> ch. 1, 20:3). For these terms do not properly apply except where the light stands on a level that relates to the lower realms so that the lower realms can emerge from there in accordance with the law of gradual progression. But here above (on the levels of the lights of SaG and the worlds of Vision and Hearing) the use of these terms is purely figurative inasmuch as this is the place of the root of these phenomena below.
Thus we find that what had to be revealed was the underlying Likeness of Man. If so, we may say that what had to be revealed was Atzilut, and the intention of the successive degrees of concealment was to bring the light eventually to this level. But all that we are talking about now is contained in the parts of this radiant splendor that we have been discussing. These parts stand in a hierarchy one under the other, in accordance with the principle of the Line of Measurement, which is that the light of each successive level is less than that of the level above it. The end goal of these lights is Atzilut. If so, we may say that the purpose of the different parts of this radiant splendor is to bring about Atzilut. <b>...which little by little becomes increasingly revealed...</b> gradually, until it reaches the point that it comes into actual existence. Accordingly their various aspects follow a gradual order, one under another.
<b>Accordingly, the inner light and encompassing light are initially far from one another, but they steadily come closer together, little by little...</b> For we certainly see in these lights something that advances gradually, stage by stage, and this is the steadily increasing closeness of the inner light and the encompassing light. Since it is the end of this gradation that actually brings forth the root of the Likeness of Man, as discussed below, we may directly infer that in these lights Atzilut is successively revealed little by little.
<b>...until they reach the mouth, where a Vessel is made.</b> What we see is that the end of this gradual process is the formation of the Vessel, and the Vessel relates to the lower realms, as it goes on to say.
<b>There the Likeness of Man is properly rooted...</b> This signifies two things. The first is that the concept of the Vessel relates to the Likeness of Man, for the essence of the Likeness of Man is the existence of the body and the soul within it, and the true root of the concept of the body is the Vessel. And since the Vessel is the end level that we see in the lights of the Ear, Nose and Mouth, we know clearly that the lights of the Ear, Nose and Mouth lead gradually to the Likeness of Man based upon the body. The second thing signified here is that the lights of the Mouth are actually made to provide the root of the World of Nekudim (Openings 36-58). The gradation is seen even more clearly in the fact that even the lights of the Eyes themselves, as will be discussed later, follow in gradation after the Mouth. This indicates that Atzilut specifically is the Likeness of Man through the mystery of MaH and BaN, which is where the vessels are found in all their details. And the root of this lies in the lights of the Mouth, which is the overall Vessel prior to the detailed revelation of everything connected with it. This is surely the nature of gradation: first comes the overall whole, and afterwards the details. We may not make only one level out of what are actually two levels.
Accordingly, we see that the lights of the Mouth are the location of the Vessel, for this is the level on which it already becomes revealed, albeit in a general way. The lights of the Eyes contain the aspect of the Vessel in a detailed way, through the mystery of MaH and BaN, as will be discussed below in the appropriate place. Accordingly the lights of the Mouth contain what was necessary in order to bring forth the various aspects of the Vessels in their place in all their details. All the aspects discussed in the Kabbalah in connection with the lights of the Mouth are to be understood entirely as preparations for what must later come into being in its place in Atzilut. This includes the revelation and completion of the Vessels, and their emergence through the departure (הסתלקות, <i>histalkut</i>) of the light. This is the root of all that relates to man’s service. And the repair is to be afterwards in Atzilut, as will be discussed in the appropriate place.
<b>...and this is the aspect of MaH and BaN that is revealed afterwards.</b> This is the end of the entire chain of development: the Likeness of Man in its place, in the mystery of MaH and BaN, as discussed above, and as will be discussed further below.

Chapter 34

<i>The connection between AV, SaG, MaH and BaN and their place of emergence from Adam Kadmon’s sensory organs</i>
<b>The passages through which the lights pass were chosen because of the way they are linked to the interior with the four Names that are arranged there, and they correspond to the different combinations in which the lights are interconnected. And the route by which the spirit travels through them is such that the place that it touches first is where it emerges.</b>
<i>Having discussed the radiant splendor that is revealed, we must now discuss the places from which the revelation comes forth.</i>
The proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: The passages...</b> This explains that there is a relationship between the passages and the lights that pass through them. <b>Part 2: ...and they correspond...</b> This explains the nature of the relationship.
<b>Part 1: The passages through which the lights pass...</b> The way in which the inner light emerges through the apertures of the face is not merely haphazard as in the case of a blazing fire covered by a perforated vessel, through which the light of the fire emerges wherever there is a hole. Had this been the way the inner light emerged, it would have had two results, both of which we know not to be the case. Firstly, since it is the same fire under all the holes, what emerges through each hole is also entirely uniform: the fire does not take on any new movements in order to exit via particular locations that might cause it to undergo some kind of change. Rather, the fire leaves wherever it finds a hole, and it passes through one hole in exactly the same way as it would leave through any other. Secondly, the fire standing covered under one hole passes out through that hole, while the fire standing under a different hole passes out there: the fire does not undergo any kind of change causing what is under one hole to go out via another.
Neither of these phenomena is found in the worlds of Vision, Hearing, Smell and Speech under discussion. In the first place, the light that is within is uniform, while that which emerges is not uniform, for it emerges in stages in several different ways. If it were the case that the light emerged purely haphazardly wherever it found an exit, the light emerging from the Ear would be no different from the light emerging from the Nose. Secondly, we do indeed find that the lights change places. For the lights of SaG emerge from the Ears, Nose and Mouth, while the lights of BaN emerge from a place that is higher than the Ears, Nose and Mouth, namely the Eyes. And the lights of MaH emerge from a place that is higher than all of these – namely, from the Forehead.
From all this it is quite evident that the way in which the light emerges is not merely haphazard. Rather, the passages were specially chosen to match their respective lights in each case. Each individual light must necessarily pass through its own particular passageway and not through any other, because of the special relationship that it has with it. Because of this relationship, the light undergoes a change when passing through the relevant passageway, for the emerging light is already subject to the influence of the aperture or “vessel” from which it comes forth.
If it were merely by accident that the light emerged from one aperture rather than any other, we could say that the light is not subject to the vessel – on the contrary, it would be free of all subjection. If that were the case, as long as the light is contained within the vessel, it could function within the constraints of the particular vessel in which it is contained. In that case, even though the light itself might be intrinsically unchanged, its <i>action</i> would change through being subject to the constraints of the vessel, as discussed earlier in connection with the Line and the Residue (see Opening 28). However, on breaking through and passing out, it should lose that subjection and act like the soul outside the body. But having said that the light passes out through a given vessel because of the specific relationship it has with that vessel, we must infer that even after its emergence, the light remains subject to the vessel – because it would not have been able to pass out through a different vessel. Even after passing out, this does not mean that it becomes free of all subjection to the vessel. On the contrary, the very nature of the vessel in question is to serve as a vessel of exit, as discussed earlier in connection with container vessels and exit vessels (see Opening 32, Part 1). This being the case, the light performs only the function of the vessel itself, and its functioning changes as if it were acting within the container vessel itself.
<b>...were chosen because of the way they are linked to the interior with the four Names that are arranged there.</b> This relationship between the emerging lights and the container vessels from which they emerge is not dependent upon the way things appear from the outside. On the contrary, this is precisely what is changed, for Ban and MaH are down below, yet they ascend higher than everything. Rather, the relationship derives from a bond forged inside, within the body. Thus we see that the whole relationship between the emerging lights and the passages through which they pass is an internal relationship which is dependent upon the order in which the Names stand arranged within, inside the body. The passageways are connected with them in the same order in which they are afterwards revealed outside.
<b>Part 2: ...and they correspond to the different combinations in which the lights are interconnected.</b> For even though we say that the Partzuf as a whole consists of ten Sefirot so that we may understand the governmental order that emerges from it, nevertheless we must examine many different details in the Sefirot, these being the totality of all the six hundred and thirteen lights contained in the Partzuf. Moreover, the main thing is to understand the links whereby these lights are connected to one another and the way they meet so as to connect one end to the other, even though they are far apart from one another in the order in which they stand. This is bound up with the way the lights join up in various different combinations: one light combines with another causing the emergence of a new offspring. This is how the different parts of the body are related one to another, so that if something happens to one part, it will be felt in the other even though the two parts in question may be very far from one another and other body parts stand between them. The intervening body parts will not feel it while those at separate ends do feel it.
The root of this matter is that the form of every Partzuf, both in general and in detail, depends upon the name MaH, as it is writen: “And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man (Adam)” (Ezekiel 1:10; the numerical value of the letters of ADaM = 45 = MaH). Now this name contains a specific number of powers, and it is these powers that divide up into various particulars, thus producing the limbs of the body with all their different properties. In some cases the particular components of the power in question unfolded in stages, one after the other, in a gradual developmental sequence. In other cases, the components of the power in question were separated from one another, with one being placed in one location and another in a different location far away from the first. Afterwards, the circuit of the spirit that circulates around all the different parts was instituted, and everything reaches the overall form, which is based on the underlying secret of the “irrigation of the tree”, which is the secret of the name MaH (see Opening 29 Part 3). Thus, when something happens to and is felt by one part of the Partzuf, it comes to the root, the name of MaH, and from there it immediately reaches the second part, which is likewise a component of the same power whose other component was affected in the first place.
It is the same in the case of man here below: the soul (<i>neshamah</i>) builds the body through one general power contained within it. This is the “Likeness of Man”, and this is the name MaH we have mentioned. For this must also exist in man here below in accordance with the secret of the “irrigation of the tree”. It is from this that the entire structure emerges, and this is what experiences all the feelings and sensations of the different parts of the body, and it is from this power that their interrelationship derives. It is the spirit (<i>ruach</i>) itself that is affected and activated in the place where it dwells.
The spirit is affected through one of the body parts according to the distinctive nature of that part, and this has an effect upon the second body part that is the natural partner of the first. When activated in one part, the overall form sends a current to the second part, which is also activated there in its place in the same way through the overall form that connects the two of them, while the intervening parts are not affected. (Thus “the eye muscles depend upon the understanding in the heart”, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 28b.) For no other part will be affected in this way except one that is the natural partner of the first and structurally coupled with it. This is comparable to the way water is affected according to the place where it is contained. The influence of the stars also proves this point, for the stars send their influences through the entire atmosphere yet their effects are felt only in the place prepared for them: there alone and nowhere else does the particular influence flash forth to act.
<b>And the route by which the spirit travels through them is such that...</b> In other words, this phenomenon has its own individual law whereby the spirit (<i>ruach</i>) circulates in this way. <b>...the place that it touches first is where it emerges.</b> For these names circle around inside, within the body (of Adam Kadmon) in accordance with the laws instituted for them. The spirit finds the limbs that it comes to first and enters into these limbs and body parts, sending forth the radiation through the parts of the face that are related to those bodily limbs and organs.
This is what makes it possible to find that the lights of BaN emerged through the Eyes while the lights of SaG emerged through the Ears, Nose and Mouth. For the circuit of SaG is arranged in such a way that it first reaches the organs that are structurally coupled with the Ears, Nose and Mouth, and its radiations passed out from there immediately. The circuit of BaN, on the other hand, reaches the limbs that are structurally coupled with the Eyes, and the same applies to MaH in relation to the Forehead.
An objection could be raised on the basis of our earlier statement that the radiance of the fissures or apertures of the face derives from the fact that the entire soul is included in the face. How is this connected with the fact that it circulates in the body?
The explanation of this matter is as follows. Every action that the spirit brings about in the body must, as we have already said, be revealed in the face. Accordingly every action that this spirit performs in the body immediately produces a corresponding power in the face which stands ready to reveal it. Simultaneously with the performance of the action through the body, it rises up and is seen in the overall expression of the face. Yet this is still not the end of its circuit. For, as you already know, the face as a whole divides up into the various sensory apertures. Accordingly, every action of the spirit in the body has a corresponding power that starts in the face and ends in one of the apertures. The general form divided up its powers in such a way that every action performed by AV or SaG brought forth and revealed in the face certain corresponding powers in the Ears, others in the Nose and others in the Mouth. The same applies to SaG of SaG and BaN: it brought forth certain corresponding powers in the Eyes in the way explained above, whereby the general form divides up into the various specific powers contained in the body.
Thus we see that the powers corresponding to AV (i.e. AV of SaG) were placed below, while those of BaN were placed above (in the Eyes) and those of MaH higher still (in the Forehead). However, the parallel is not between the parts of the spirit and the parts of the body (e.g. between BaN and the Eyes) for they are not in the same category. Rather, it is between these parts of the body and those parts of the body. If so, we must say that the limbs and organs where BaN circulates are those corresponding to the Eyes. Accordingly, when BaN reaches those limbs below, it immediately shines forth in the corresponding part of the face, and from there to the Eyes, and the same applies to all of them.<br> In summary: The circulating spirit – the totality of AV, SaG, MaH and BaN – produces powers in the body. For example, the light of BaN produces the powers of the legs, and there is thus a link between BaN and the legs. Everything that happens in the body is visible in the radiance of the face and produces a fissure, i.e. one of the senses. Thus the power in the leg eventually produces vision, and this is how BaN is connected with the Eyes.

Chapter 35

<i>Absorbed within the lights that break forth from the branches of Adam Kadmon is the root of the Vessel.</i>
<b>It is in Adam Kadmon that the connection of the Line with the Residue which it took as its vessel was brought about. Thus the light emerging by way of the senses is light that is already joined with the vessel, which is why it afterwards brings forth the vessel through the lights of the mouth. This alone is the light suitable for the construction of all the structures built out of it, and that which was necessary to build all the intended structures went forth and unfolded gradually in stages as necessary to serve the intended purpose of these structures.</b>
<i>Having discussed the light emerging from the apertures of the face and the locations from which the radiations go forth, we must now explain what has to be understood about the nature of the emerging light itself.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: It is in Adam Kadmon that the connection...</b> Mixed in with the light emerging from Adam Kadmon is the Vessel. <b>Part 2: This alone...</b> This explains why this must be so.
<b>Part 1: It is in Adam Kadmon that the connection of the Line with the Residue... was brought about.</b> All the different aspects of Adam Kadmon are the aspects that are necessary in order to join the Line and the Residue together, because these are the two foundations of the government of the world, as discussed earlier. The entire purpose is to bring about the return of evil to good. Evil is rooted in the governmental order that came about after the concealment (i.e. in the Residue) and the various laws which constitute this order. The Line has to assert itself against each of these laws and take control in order to bring it back to good.
Here in truth is the underlying secret of the soul and the body. All the different aspects of evil are rooted in the body, while the soul is placed in the body with the intention that it should gain control over each one of these different aspects and bring them back to good. This is accomplished through the unique power of the commandments (<i>mitzvot</i>), which the Supreme Will prepared for this purpose. With careful consideration you will find that according to this, everything in creation exists only to come to the soul and the body, for it is precisely here that evil is turned back to good in actuality. Physical man is at the end of all existence – the end point and goal for which everything was brought into being in order to turn evil back to good – while Adam Kadmon is the head and start of all existence and thus the beginning of this goal. All the different measures and aspects required to serve as the root of this goal were instituted in Adam Kadmon so that in the end they should function in actuality. All the lights emerging from Adam Kadmon always proceed in stages, one after the other, in accordance with the underlying secret of the soul and the body (i.e. as their roots) until the actual body and soul of man emerge below in their place, as will be discussed further in Part 2.
<b>...which it took as its vessel...</b> In other words, this is the connection that was brought about: the law was so instituted that there should be an interior (פנימיות, <i>pnimiyut</i>) consisting of lights and an exterior (חיצוניות, <i>chitzoniyut</i>) consisting of vessels, and that each light should radiate in its vessel and purify it.
<b>Thus the light emerging by way of the senses is light that is already joined with the vessel...</b> Do not think that this emerging light is simple light, for it comes from a connection that has already been made, after which no further developments emerge without the two, the light and the vessel, being connected. Accordingly, even though it appears at first as if this light emerging from Adam Kadmon’s sense organs contains no vessel, the truth is that something of the category of the vessel is certainly absorbed within it. However, because the light is so overpowering, these “vessels” cannot be discerned at all.
<b>...which is why it afterwards brings forth the vessel through the lights of the mouth.</b> This proves that aspects of the vessel are absorbed in the emerging light, for in the end we find that the vessel comes out of these emerging lights themselves. If the light were simple, it would have been impossible for the vessel to come from there. For, as you have already heard, the vessel and the light are two completely different categories, and it is impossible for one kind to emerge from a completely different kind. For a cause cannot produce an effect with which it has no integral connection. Aspects of the vessel must certainly exist absorbed within the lights, except that this is not discernible in the higher levels up above. But the further it descends, the more it becomes successively revealed, until it is revealed completely.
And know that this is the secret of the letters mentioned in the Kabbalistic writings in connection with the lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth, for wherever there are letters, they indicate the presence of some aspect of the vessel. It is just that in the lights of the Ear, the roots of the vessel are barely discernible except in the form of one letter (a <i>Heh</i>). In the Nose they are a little more revealed (as the letter <i>Vav</i> of the <i>Heh</i>, consisting of six <i>Alephs</i>), and in the Mouth even more so (in the form of another four <i>Alephs</i>). Finally, in the action brought about in the lights of the mouth (their emergence and return) the vessel is revealed completely.
<b>Part 2: This alone is the light suitable for the construction of all the structures built out of it...</b> The reason why it is logical that the emerging light should contain within it the category of the vessel is because the structures built out of it need to follow the dichotomy of the soul and the body, and if so, the light must necessarily derive from this category.
<b>...and that which was necessary to build all the intended structures went forth...</b> This resolves what appears to be a major problem, which is that things do not proceed in a perfect order. In a perfect order, all the Names should bring forth their lights equally. Yet we see that while all the branches of AV went forth (although they are concealed), out of SaG only three aspects of AV of SaG emerged and only the beginning of SaG of SaG, while afterwards MaH came forth in its entirety and so too did BaN.
The answer to this is that <b>...This alone is the light…</b> This means that each function depends on a particular combination of lights designed to produce precisely that function with its unique characteristics. This is connected with our discussion below of the purification of BaN. We cannot ask, “Why <i>these</i> combinations rather than any others?” For the Supreme Will knew that in order to bring forth existence in the necessary way, it was precisely these combinations of those roots that were required, no less and no more.
On the contrary, when it comes to combinations, things do not proceed in order. Rather, it is necessary to add more of one kind and less of another in order to produce exactly the desired combination with its unique properties. The intention here was to bring forth Atzilut in accordance with the underlying secret of the Likeness of Man. What was required in order to accomplish this were three aspects of AV (i.e. of AV of SaG), one aspect of SaG (i.e. one aspect of SaG of SaG, namely BaN of SaG of SaG), MaH in its entirety and BaN in its entirety. Out of all of these together, the Likeness of Man emerges with its unique character. This would not have been the case had it emerged in accordance with the character of the lights that brought it forth, as they would have had to maintain the order between them. But since it goes according to the resultant compound and its unique intended character – i.e. not according to the intrinsic nature of the light itself but rather according to the needs of the intended structure that was to be built out of it – only what was required according to the nature of the desired structure went forth.
<b>...and unfolded gradually in stages as necessary to serve the intended purpose of these structures.</b> This means that since this light emerged in order to build these structures, it had to be sufficient for everything required for this. Accordingly it went from passage to passage, emerging in different ways as required in order to prepare the structures that were to be built in accordance with their intended purpose. The ultimate goal was to produce physical man here below, for this entire existence is for him.
You must understand how this gradual process develops and advances stage by stage in accordance with the dichotomy of body and soul, for it is quite evident that the body, being thick and coarse, can only be produced through concealment and a lack of light. Thus, as long as the lights were shining with great power, the root of the body was not discernible among them. This is why in AV, where the lights are very dominant, there is no mention of any letter, for no root of the vessel can be seen or discerned there. At first it is revealed, albeit slightly, in the Ear. More of it is revealed in the Nose and even more in the Mouth, until it is completely revealed.
You will also see that the powers of the soul (<i>neshamah</i>) consist of the Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah and Neshamah-of-the-Neshamah. AV is the Neshamah-of-the-Neshamah and the ultimate illumination, and accordingly, the root of the body is not revealed at all on that level. In the Ear, the Neshamah-of-the-Neshamah is concealed, and the body begins to be revealed. In the Nose, the Neshamah too is concealed, while the body is even more revealed. In the Mouth, the Ruach is also concealed, while the body is completely revealed. This is bound up with the teaching that the lights of the Mouth emerged only on the level of the Nefesh, as discussed in detail elsewhere (see <i>Ginzey Ramchal</i> p. 300).

<big><strong>The World of Nekudim (Openings 36-50)</strong></big>
<i>The World of Nekudim</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE</small></b></sup><i class="footnote">The name Nekudim derives from the verse in Genesis 31:10: “I saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the flock were streaked, speckled and grizzled”. “Streaked” (עקודים, <i>akudim</i>) alludes to the World of Akudim, the lights of the Mouth of Adam Kadmon, which were contained in a single vessel, as discussed in the preceding Openings. “Speckled” (נקודים, <i>nekudim</i>) alludes to the World of Nekudim, so-called because it is the “world” in which the vowel points (<i>nekudim</i>) emerged as “broken”, separate and unconnected vessels, prior to the Tikkun (“repair” or “rectification”). <i>Nekudim</i> is the plural form of the Hebrew word <i>nikud</i> (cf. <i>nekudah</i>), which means a “dot” or “point” (as in <i>Tosefta Shabbat</i> 12:8). The word <i>nekudim</i> is also found with the connotation of “crumbled pieces” (in Joshua 9:12 and <i>Terumah</i> 5:1).</i><b>The World of Nekudim was when Atzilut with all its branches were successively being made, like the way in which a craftsman makes a vessel out of a piece of wood: at first it is a shapeless mass, but afterwards, when its form is completed, its beauty is then visible in its complete form.</b>
<i>Now starts the World of the Nekudim – the World of Chaos (תוהו, </i>Tohu<i>). This is the first thing that must be explained after the preceding discussion because this is the light that emerged after the lights we have discussed above.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The World of Nekudim was when...</b> This provides the definition of the World of Nekudim. <b>Part 2: ...like the way in which a craftsman...</b> This provides us with a metaphorical way of understanding this world.
<b>Part 1: The World of Nekudim was when Atzilut with all its branches...</b> “Atzilut” refers to everything in the world of Atzilut, while the “branches” are Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah with all their offspring. All of them are woven in a single web and fall under one category, for they are one whole bound together in a single bond, starting with Atzilut and ending with Asiyah. This is the true root of everything in the lower realms, and it did not exist until we reached this level. Man himself is a combination of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, corresponding to his Nefesh (Asiyah), Ruach (Yetzirah), Neshamah (Beriyah) and Neshamah-of-the-Neshamah (Atzilut). All the different creatures come under the same order in the categories of Inanimate (corresponding to Asiyah), Vegetable (Yetzirah), Animal (Beriyah) and Man (Atzilut).
<b>...were successively being made...</b> This indicates that Eyn Sof did not want to produce everything fully-formed from the very outset but rather, gradually, stage by stage, starting with the minimum perfection and advancing steadily towards ever-increasing perfection, until complete perfection reigns. Accordingly, what exists at the end is what existed at the outset, although it then lacked the perfection that was intended to come afterwards.
<b>Part 2: ...like the way in which a craftsman makes a vessel out of a piece of wood.</b> This means that Eyn Sof did not want to act in accordance with His own intrinsic, limitless power, for He would then have produced complete perfection instantaneously. Rather, He acted like a craftsman who is only able to work gradually, in stages. He takes the lump of material in front of him and shapes it little by little. It undergoes many different changes of form, from one to another, until finally it ends up in its complete form.
<b>At first it is a shapeless mass, but afterwards, when its form is completed, its beauty is then visible in its complete form.</b> It starts off as a completely formless substance, then afterwards it steadily takes on more and more of a distinct form. Nevertheless, only when the form is complete is the beauty visible, but one who sees the shapeless mass at the outset or in its initial forms will merely see something faulty. However, in the end the true form will be seen in all its beauty, and it will then be evident that all this was necessary in order to come to that beauty.
This is exactly the way in which Atzilut developed. The Supreme Will began to design it above in the Supreme Mind (המחשבה העליונה, <i>hamachshavah ha-elyonah</i>). It was while it was still beginning to take shape, before its form was complete, that the lights of the Nekudim emerged, corresponding to Atzilut before it was complete. Afterwards the design of Atzilut was complete, and it emerged in all the beauty of its intrinsic form, this being the state of Tikkun, “repair” or “rectification”, as will be discussed below.
Two things must be understood here. The first is that the World of Nekudim came into existence when the World of Atzilut first began to take shape, before it was complete. Atzilut was then like a vessel whose form was as yet incomplete. The second thing that must be understood is that the World of Nekudim is not to be identified with the World of Atzilut itself. Rather, it is what emerged while the form of Atzilut was still incomplete.
Thus the <i>Zohar</i> states: “When the Craftsman pounded with the iron hammer, it produced sparks on all sides, and the emerging sparks came out as flashes that lit up and were then immediately extinguished, and these are called the Primordial Worlds, and because of this they were destroyed and did not endure...” (<i>Idra Zuta</i> 292b).
Let me explain this: The other levels prior to the World of Nekudim (e.g. the worlds of Vision, Hearing and Smell of Adam Kadmon) can properly be called levels leading to the world of Atzilut, because they continue to possess the same quality they always had. When we examine this more closely we find it to be one quality which steadily approaches the Likeness of Man that typifies Atzilut, although it is still a little distant from it because the development is gradual. However, we cannot call the World of Nekudim a “level”, because it is not something that endured. It existed, and then it was negated, and now, in its place, is the actual Atzilut. If so, Nekudim cannot be called a <i>level</i> leading to Atzilut, because if it were, it should have remained in existence. Otherwise we would be faced with a “leap”, because one level would be missing, while the supreme intention was to arrange all the lights in order, one under the other, and if there is no need for this level now, it was also unnecessary at the outset.
Rather, we should say that the Nekudim are not to be understood as a level on the scale leading to Atzilut. They are something different. The Nekudim correspond to the “flashes” and “sparks” mentioned by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (<i>Zohar</i> II, 254b). As the craftsman pounds the metal, the flashes and sparks are what separates from the body of the metal under the impact of the blow that comes to shape and fix the vessel. Following this metaphor, Atzilut is where the Supreme Mind took the underlying mystery of the Likeness of Man in order to establish it on its foundation, and the Supreme Mind then picked out what had to be removed and discarded from there. And what was it that had to be removed? Evil.
In other words, the purpose of those lights (i.e. of Nekudim) was to bring forth evil, for the concealment had already reached the level from which it was possible for evil to emerge. The intention here was not that the lights of the Likeness of Man should produce evil. On the contrary, the whole intention was that they should be purified and rectified, as will be discussed in due course. It was then that what stood ready to produce evil became separated from the essential body of the Likeness of Man, which stood ready to arrange things in the the proper way. It was then that He brought forth and separated this function (evil) from the Likeness of Man, and it came forth and was seen in itself, these being the “sparks” that “flashed… and were then immediately extinguished”. Thus they performed their allotted task. For initially they emerged with a flash, as if they too had control, and indeed it was from their rule that evil emerged. Had they had no place or function at all in the governmental order, they would not have amounted to anything. Rather, they flashed and appeared and ruled... and because of the evil, they were destroyed. This is the function of the Other Side: to cause destruction to this root. The <i>Zohar</i> accordingly states (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that “the Mind scattered sparks on three hundred and twenty sides”, these being the entirety of all these kings (the shattered vessels).
We may sum up by saying that Atzilut was steadily taking shape, and initially it took on a certain form that had the purpose of producing evil. This is its incomplete, imperfect form, inasmuch as it contains forces standing in an imperfect state suited to the production of evil. This is the state seen afterwards in the kings themselves: i.e. the first three (Keter, Chochmah and Binah) were insufficiently prepared to provide the needs of the seven lower Sefirot, while the lower Sefirot themselves were altogether unable to endure. Thus, when this function existed in the Likeness of Man, it was ready to produce evil. What did the Supreme Mind do? He brought this function forth and removed it from the Likeness of Man. It was a power contained within the Likeness to produce this function, and He brought it forth and made it separate, by itself. (This is the “serpent”, the evil side, which stands outside of man. Initially, it was mixed up within him in order to allow it to enter if man sins.) It is not the main essence but a small power that is part of the overall Likeness, whereas the essence of the Likeness is to bring things to a state of repair.
And this small power divides in turn into many particulars, and the Supreme Mind then brought forth all these particulars by themselves and gave them a certain power, as will be discussed further below. However, if the Supreme Will had so desired, He could have produced the Likeness already prepared from the very outset, without including evil at all. But He wanted it to contain this deficiency, and that it should depart from it in such a way that it should attain permanent repair only at the end. This is the perfect form after the removal of all that limits it. And what this perfect form is, you will see below, with the help of Heaven.

Chapter 37

<i>All the damage and repairs in the world are rooted in the breaking of the vessels and their repair.</i>
<b>The root of the existence of damage and repair lies in the process of the breaking of the vessels and their repair. For if there had been no damage in them, there would have been no destruction in the world. And if their repair had been fully completed, that would have been the end of everything. However, the way it happened is that the damage came, and afterwards the repair. And the repair was not completed except to the degree that would provide a root for the cycle of destruction and repair to continue in the world. And at the end of everything there will be a complete repair, after which there will be no more damage at all.</b>
<i>Having introduced the general subject of the Nekudim, we will now enter into the details.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The root of the existence...</b> This is a general statement of the first principle relating to the Nekudim and their repair. <b>Part 2: For if there had been no damage...</b> This specifies the implications of this principle.
<b>Part 1: The root of the existence of damage and repair...</b> For the Sefirot are the calculations and measures devised by the Supreme Mind to cover the needs of the entire governmental order, and if creation and destruction exist in the world, this must be rooted in the Sefirot.
<b>...lies in the breaking of the vessels and their repair.</b> For at first sight it might appear that the root of creation should be in the lights of Kindness (<i>chessed</i>) while the root of destruction should be in the lights of Judgment (<i>din</i>), but not that there should be lights which destroy and negate other lights. For it would seem that the concepts of both creation and destruction should apply only to the creations. But the <i>power</i> of destruction does not negate the <i>power</i> of creation – and yet we say that the Sefirot (of Nekudim) existed, and that they were negated and broken. Likewise it seems problematical to say that the Other Side (<i>Sitra Achra</i>) emerged from these very Sefirot – surely destruction does not come out of creation.
The root of this whole matter lies in what has already been explained earlier (in Opening 4) about how the entire governmental order of the Supreme Mind is directed only to revealing the perfect light of God, so that ultimately general beneficence will extend to all. Man and all the other created beings are nothing but the revelation of this order of government. For besides ruling the world in this way, He wanted to reveal His government in and through the creation of man. He made man, and so too all the other creatures after him, in such a way that man in all his different parts alludes to all the different kinds of ways in which the Holy One, blessed be He, governs His creations. Included in this is everything that can possibly be said about this government. In other words, the fact that the government itself is alluded to and revealed in man’s body also depends on the underlying Likeness of Man itself, and so too in the case of the orders of nature and its laws.
Thus the existence of the governmental order above, its being drawn down to be revealed in this way in man, its actualization in the making of man and man’s existence from it – all depend on the Likeness of Man itself. All this came about through the way the Supreme Mind designed this Likeness, i.e. this is how He designed the governmental order in all its laws. We must accordingly infer that all the calculations and measures (i.e. the Sefirot) seen to have been devised by the Supreme Mind correlate to the creations in all their parts. For the roots of the creations are those very laws of government and its ways. To provide a root for any one division of creatures requires a separate law in the order of government. All levels of the lights are this way. For the upper worlds are themselves the creations rooted in a great root, while the worlds below them are those same creations rooted in a smaller root than the first.
The Supreme Mind first calculated how the creations should be in their unrectified state, i.e. that they should contain many parts of evil. In the worlds above, these are the governmental laws of destruction, which stand ready to destroy those very entities, and these parts were included in them. Afterwards He calculated how those same realms and beings were to be in a state of destruction and negation. The evil components mixed up in them were to attack and gain power, bringing about their own destruction. On the level of the upper realms the existing entities are then seen to be broken, destroyed and negated because of the rule of the evil components over those entities themselves. Now, since these entities existed on the level of the upper world (that of the Sefirot) and were also destroyed, we see that they were indeed brought into existence in the mode of creation and destruction. However, initially it was the force of destruction that took greater and greater control – which would not have allowed anything to exist at all. Afterwards the Supreme Mind calculated how these entities should exist in a state of repair, though not one of complete repair. They were to be rectified only to the extent that they are now: they are not in complete ruins – they exist – but they are damaged. The measure and calculation of how existence is to be in this state constitutes the Sefirot as they are now, after the “balance” (משקלא, <i>mashkela</i>, “weight” or “scales” – <i>Zohar</i>,<i> Terumah</i> 176b). This balance is the key to the entire repair. (See Opening 59 Part 1 and Opening 69 Part 1.)
However, there is something else that you must understand: just as when destruction held sway, it completely destroyed what existed, so too it was necessary to institute a repair that would be the very opposite of destruction. The power of creation must hold complete sway so that destruction will no longer have any existence at all. Included among the laws of government, there is indeed this law that everything should reach such a level of perfection. So far, however, this has not come about. Everything that gives the creations existence did indeed come forth, but not what gives them endurance forever. On the contrary, the power of destruction still holds sway so as not to allow this perfection to exist.
This power of destruction prevents what exists from enduring in a state of complete perfection, causing it to go through cycles of creation and destruction. Sometimes the power of creation gains strength and endures for a long period, sometimes the opposite is the case, and the power of destruction attacks and destroys what exists. But when the time comes for complete perfection to emerge and for the giving of this law that will cause what exists to attain complete perfection, this will totally negate evil. The creations themselves will then also include components that are not present in them now, corresponding to and revealing this perfection.
We have here two things. There is the Other Side (<i>Sitra Achra</i>), which is the opposite of what is rectified – this is what was rejected and expelled from the Sefirot. Then there is what remains of the kings that has not yet been purified. The Other Side is something that was allowed to exist but was nevertheless rejected and cast aside so as not to destroy the rest of existence. However, it did not pass from the world. It just does not destroy everything now as it did at the time of the initial destruction. Nevertheless, it stands ready and waiting to be aroused at its ordained time and within its ordained limit.
As to what remains of the kings that was not purified: this means that the damaged parts prevent certain laws contained within the governmental order from operating now, and the same applies to certain parts contained within the independent realms and beings that are ruled by it. These laws are the laws of perfection, under which there will be no more evil at all. The emergence of these laws comes about through the constant process of sifting and purification that is going on with steadily increasing gain each and every day, as will be explained in its appropriate place. And when they complete their process of purification and come to full existence, they will do what is within their power so that there will be no more evil in the world, leading to a state of repair that cannot possibly be followed by any damage whatsoever.
<b>Part 2: For if there had been no damage in them, there would have been no destruction in the world.</b> As I have already explained to you, the “kings” that were negated (the Sefirot that were “broken”) are themselves the measure and calculation of the way things were to be in their state of destruction. <b>And if their repair had been fully completed, that would have been the end of everything.</b> This refers to the complete perfection that must emerge in the creations in order for them to endure, as mentioned above.
<b>However, the way it happened is that the damage came, and afterwards the repair. And the repair was not completed...</b> Thus we have the two beginnings – the creation and the destruction – that we discussed above. <b>...except to the degree that would provide a root for the cycle of destruction and repair...</b> For it is already clear that everything was brought about with exact measurement. Thus without the repair on all those levels on which it was brought about, it would not have been possible for man’s service to add further repair. But had the repair been greater, there would have been no further need for any kind of service.<br> <b>...that would provide a root for the cycle of destruction and repair to continue in the world.</b> Since they are both in one balance, sometimes one increases and sometimes the other.
<b>And at the end of everything there will be a complete repair, after which there will be no more damage at all.</b> In other words, from the outset, the intention was to fix and rectify, but the Supreme Will wanted to start the process Himself while leaving the completion in the hands of man. And when man’s work is at last completed, that will be the end of the work, and a state of repair will reign with no destruction at all after it.

Chapter 38

<i>The connection of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah with Atzilut</i>
<b>Taken as a whole, Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are one world with three garments. This is because Atzilut itself is not complete except with its garments. However, when we examine these garments individually, each one is called a world in itself. And in truth, each one has a function of its own. Accordingly, when we look at Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah with Atzilut, they can be considered only as the garments of Atzilut. However, when they are considered according to their functions, they are called worlds in themselves.</b>
<i>We must now examine the subject of the Nekudim in detail, However, since the details comprise the entire system of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah and how they emerge, this is what must be explained first.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: Taken as a whole, Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah...</b> This explains their overall arrangement.<b> Part 2: Accordingly...</b> This explains two aspects they contain because of this.
<b>Part 1: Taken as a whole, Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah...</b> This means that Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are not a hierarchy of four worlds on a scale, each literally separate from the other, as in the case of the lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth. Rather, they are all one system. The proof of this is that when we speak about worlds arranged as separate levels on a scale, each must be a complete world in itself. Every lower world is then actually like the world above it, and all the powers of the higher world are contained in the lower world except on a different level of the scale. In a scale of this nature, we could not say that any one of these worlds has a particular function that another does not have. For if this were the case, just as if a lower world were to function alone, its function would be lacking the unique aspect possessed by the world above it, so too, if the higher world were to function alone, it would be lacking the unique aspect possessed by the lower one. If so, it is not that the entire system itself as contained in the higher world descends down from level to level. Rather, they are many levels, all of them causal factors in one system that requires them all.
Now in the case of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, each provides a separate division of creations. Beriyah provides the souls and Yetzirah provides the angels, while Asiyah provides the material entities. If so, the separate creations (נפרדים, <i>nifradim</i>) are one system resulting from many causes, these being all the various worlds. They are not one thing that descends level by level from root to root.
And you would not be correct in saying that this too is a hierarchical scale made up of the souls on one level, the angels on another and the material creation on yet another. For the Kabbalistic sages taught: “Imma nests in the world of the Throne (=Beriyah), Zeir Anpin nests in the Six Directions (=Yetzirah), while the Shechinah nests in the Wheel (=Asiyah)” (<i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> #6, 23a; see <i>Etz Chayim</i> Pt. II, <i>Shaar Seder ABY”A</i>). Imma, Zeir and Nukva are not a hierarchy of levels one below the other, each a mirror of the other. Rather, each is something in itself, even though they do emerge in a developmental sequence. So too, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are each something separate in itself, because each one has its own function. And these functions are those I have ennumerated: the bringing forth of souls, angels and the material world, which correspond respectively to Imma, Zeir and Nukva.
You will, moreover, see later that the soul itself comes literally from the four worlds of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, and no soul is perfect without the four parts of Neshamah-of-the-Neshamah, Neshamah, Ruach and Nefesh. These are not all one and the same thing descending level by level. For each one is a unique power different from all the others, and each has its own function. The Nefesh sustains the body through the liver. The Ruach ascends and descends, causing all the different feelings and sensations. The soul sits in judgment over the intelligent thoughts in the mind and brain. If so, we see that Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are all causes that join together to produce one whole, this being the separate creations (נפרדים, <i>nifradim</i>) in their entirety, or the soul in its entirety. If so, they are not a scale. Since they all join together to produce one entire whole, we may infer that they are all one system which requires all these things in order to be complete in all its parts.
<b>...are one world with three garments.</b> For in the material world we live in, we have the body and its clothes, and the root of this must exist above. Now the clothes are what covers the body after it is already complete in all aspects, for the covering is not a part of the body. There can be many garments, one on top of the other, and not one of them adds any new aspect to the body. The same is true of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah in relation to Atzilut. For we already know that the entire government is brought to completion in Atzilut, and it is here that all the couplings (זיווגים, <i>zivugim</i>) take place, producing all the different aspects needed for all the creatures in the world. However, this is not revealed as such in the lower worlds except through a garb of garments, these being Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, which are nothing but veils concealing Atzilut. As you have already heard, Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are all one system. They are not merely separate levels of a hierarchical scale but a system in which these three serve to conceal the light of Atzliut and garb it so as to bring it down to the lower levels.
<b>This is because Atzilut itself is not complete except with its garments.</b> What this means is that since it is proper that man should be clothed in his garments, if so, when we speak about the supreme Likeness of Man, we understand this as being clothed in garments. Accordingly, when we speak of Atzilut, we must undertand that it has three garments – i.e. Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah in the category of garments, as discussed further below. Atzilut is unable to carry out even what specifically relates to it except if it is clothed in Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah as garments, which become the “wings” of the Shechinah, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>.
<b>However, when we examine these garments individually...</b> The purpose of all the supernal lights depends on their functions. This means that certain lights may be merely subsidiary to other lights in some given function, yet nevertheless each one is a great light in itself comprising many important principles (עיקרים, <i>ikarim</i>). And when they are not subsidiary to those other lights, they are called fundamental principles in their own right, and it is then necessary to consider the different divisions contained in them in accordance with their individual purpose. So it is with these garments. There is a time when they are subsidiary to Atzilut. In other words, there is the reality of the existence of the functions carried out in the world, which require that the garments be secondary to Atzilut. On the other hand, there are the conditions required as a necessary basis for these functions, and in this aspect they are examined separately, each by itself.
<b>...each one is called a world in itself...</b> For in every case where a function is drawn down complete in all its necessary levels, those levels are collectively called a complete world, as stated earlier (Opening 31). <b>And in truth, each one has a function of its own.</b> These are the functions explained above and in the continuation:
<b>Accordingly, when we look at Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah with Atzilut, they can be considered only as the garments of Atzilut.</b> This is as we said above: the functions themselves are executed only in Atzilut, and Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are subsidiary to them, for they are merely influenced by and drawn after Atzilut but they do not act independently, and in this aspect they are called garments. <b>However, when they are considered according to their functions, they are called worlds in themselves…</b> to the extent to which they act, this being the revelation of the function carried out in Atzilut.

Chapter 39

<i>The world of Nekudim is the material out of which all the details divide up.</i>
<b>The world of Nekudim was like one material out of which all the details must afterwards divide up. This is because all that exists, both above and below, is all only one system built of many details. It is not comprehensive unless all its details stand in it equally. For in this way, everything in creation exists only for the glory of the Creator. This is the intent of the verse, “God has made everything for His own purpose” (Proverbs 16:4). In this are included all the creations, the good and the bad, for everything is only one system and one single existence of a creation that completes the revelation of the unity and glory of Eyn Sof, blessed be He.</b>
<i>Having discussed Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah as an overall whole in order to explain what relates to the world of Nekudim, we now come to discuss the world of Nekudim in this light.</i>
The proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: The world of Nekudim was...</b> This presents the first principle regarding the world of Nekudim, which is the entirety of all that exists afterwards. <b>Part 2: This is because...</b> This explains how this is so.
<b>Part 1: The world of Nekudim was like one material...</b> The world of Nekudim is therefore not called a level on a scale, since it is only the totality of all that exists, level by level, after the world of Akudim (the latter being the light emerging from the mouth of Adam Kadmon. This light extends to the navel, while Nekudim extends from the navel to the feet of Adam Kadmon). However, everything was still like material that had not received any form. (It was like a formless general substance out of which Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah were later formed. Accordingly, Nekudim is not in itself a <i>level</i> in the order of the worlds.) Nekudim is a single general law which simply institutes the existence of all that is destined to exist. For as you have already heard, this world of Nekudim is nothing but the particular power in the Likeness of Man that stands to produce evil. However, the end goal is not to produce evil but that it should revert to good. Except that it would be impossible for evil to revert to good in actuality unless evil first exists in actuality.
When we examine what is involved in this in detail, we see that in order for all evil to revert to good, it requires everything that exists from the head of Atzilut to the end of Asiyah. This purpose is fulfilled neither by the Sefirot on their own nor by the separate creations on their own, but both are required in order to complete this purpose. Moreover, in this aspect there is no difference between the highest of all the Sefirot and the lowest of all the separate creations: both exist only to reveal the unity of Eyn Sof, blessed be He and blessed be His Name for ever and to all eternity. This is the intent of the verse quoted later in the proposition: “God has made everything for His own purpose”. Accordingly this was the first thing revealed now in the lights of the Eyes (from which the Nekudim emerged), where the Supreme Mind designed all the supreme laws of government (the Sefirot of Atzilut) and likewise all the separate creations (Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah) around this one common aspect: that they exist to reveal the supreme unity through bringing evil back to good.
Now you will see a major difference between this design (ציור, <i>tziur</i>, a “picture”) in Nekudim and every other design on whatever level it might be – and therefore the world of Nekudim is not the same as any other world, whether before it or after it. All the other worlds are separate realms structured according to a design in the Supreme Mind, but the designs themselves consist of different kinds of governmental laws. For example, the design of man’s eye on the level of the thought in the Mind consists of various kinds of laws relating to supervision, and these laws themselves are the exact cognate of the human eye below in all its different parts and colors. However, what is extra here (in Nekudim) is that there are two designs: the design of the way the lower realms are to be governed, as mentioned above, and in addition, the design of the lower realms according to what they are in themselves.
For there are necessarily two entities (מציאויות, <i>metziuyot</i>) – i.e. the Likeness of Man must be understood in two ways: (1) as the order of government (הנהגה, <i>hanhagah</i>) consisting of all these different kinds of governmental laws; (2) as the design of the image or representation (מראה, <i>mar’eh</i>) of that governmental order as seen in the separate creations themselves down below (for it is they who are governed). One general law is necessary to give existence to both. To produce the separate creations in themselves, there has to be one power that governs the form in which they are designed, and this power stands over the separate creations themselves to maintain them in their appointed form. This is what <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> calls <i>Tzur Tak</i>, (צור טק, <i>TzuR TaK</i>, “the ‘knot of forms’ – for all the forms designed in the world were designed out of this” – <i>Raavad</i>, Introduction to <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>). This contains the power to bring forth the separate creations into actual being out of nothingness (יש מאין, <i>yesh meayin</i>) so as to be branches of it. This is because it is a unique kind of radiation that produces no other branches except separate creations, being out of nothingness, in accordance with the unique aspect of this power.
And indeed, this power does not exist as an intrinsic aspect of the Sefirot. (The Sefirot themselves are on the level of Godly light, whereas the separate realms which derive from this power are creations.) That is to say, it cannot simply be equated with the last level of the lights of the Sefirot (Malchut). This is because it comes forth according to the principle of being out of nothingness, which is not a gradual process but a radical leap. (Thus <i>Tzur Tak</i>, the power to produce being out of nothingness, is not simply a level on the scale. Rather it is a unique power that is impossible for us to understand since being out of nothingness is intrinsically beyond our comprehension.) Yet with the coming into existence of separate realms (Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah) – an actual creation of being out of nothingness – an extension is found to exist from the Sefirot (the Godly light of Atzilut) over these separate realms so as to bring them into existence as branches of that extension.
Now there is a difference between the aspect of the Likeness of Man included in this world (of Nekudim) by way of governmental laws and the aspect of the Likeness of Man included in it by way of the design of the image or representation (the separate worlds themselves). The aspect of the governmental laws was able to exist in its entirety with all its branches, which are only lights, just as is the root. However, the aspect manifested in the image or representation – the separate creations – could only exist in actuality through the power of <i>Tzur Tak</i>, its branches being contained therein in potential. (For <i>Tzur Tak</i> is a power and is not itself one of the separate creations, yet it produces separate creations, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, as its branches, and they are said to be “in potential” in relation to <i>Tzur Tak</i>, for they are not in the same category but emerge from it.) For its intrinsic nature is to produce separate branches corresponding to all the details contained in it. This is not so in the case of the other Sefirot, whose nature is not to produce anything as their branches except other lights.
To summarize: There are two kinds of roots. There is a root that produces branches of the same kind as itself, and a root that produces branches that are not of the same kind as itself. The totality of these two roots constitutes the world of Nekudim. That is to say, Nekudim is not to be identified as consisting of the roots themselves. Rather, it is the overall category that includes these two species of roots. Nekudim is the law that establishes the existence of these two roots, together with all their necessary offshoots. Nekudim may be called the beginning of all these offshoots, which also come forth level by level, changing from state to state. The start of both roots is in Nekudim, which is like their overall substance or material, out of which afterwards all the individual roots come forth one by one, garbed in their own separate design or form, each one bringing forth its respective branches in accordance with its intrinsic nature.
It could be objected that if so, Nekudim is a level on the way to Atzilut, and we should count it between Akudim and Atzilut. Yet we said above (Opening 36 Part 2) that it cannot be counted as such, because if so, it could not be something that was afterwards negated. The answer is that this level cannot be counted together with the various levels of the lights of the branches of Adam Kadmon, because they do not come under the same category. For the different levels of the lights are different levels of the Likeness of Man descending in a graded way from power to power – from a greater power to a lesser power. However, what we are talking about in the case of Nekudim is not a sequential development from above to below. Rather, the change of level is that of a single power that shifts from state to state (from the light of <i>Tzur Tak</i>, which is a Godly power, to the separate realms and beings, which exist as independent creations), and the difference between one state and another in the world of Akudim is not one of degree.
To return to the main theme: The world of Nekudim is an overall category that produces these two kinds of roots with all their offshoots: the lights governing Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are the offshoots of one root, and the separate creations themselves are the offshoot of a different root. This will help explain what you will always hear us saying, that everything was made through the process of selection and purification (בירורים, <i>birurim</i>) of the Primordial Kings. For this is how the lights emerge from this general category, just as do the separate creations. However, it is only in respect of the overall goal of turning evil back to good that all are equal, as stated above. Although we say that Nekudim is a category, it must be understood as being more than a category but rather as a single material or substance that includes all that comes after it.
This is the same as we said above (Opening 27) regarding the Residue. It is a category in the sense that it includes the entire array of all the details into which it will divide, but it is called a single material or substance (i.e. the Residue constitutes the overall category of Tzimztum and is also the “substance” that includes the entire creation). It is a single substance in the sense that it constitutes the totality of all the individual entities that must divide into their various divisions, each one by itself, according to their appropriate form.
<b>...out of which all the details must afterwards divide up.</b> This is what we said above, that all that exists, including both the lights and the separate creations, are only the details of this overall, all-embracing category.
<b>Part 2: This is because all that exists, both above and below, is all only one system built of many details.</b> This includes both the lights and the separate creations. <b>It is not comprehensive unless all its details stand in it equally.</b> For the intention here is that everything connected in any way with evil must revert to good so that through this complete return, the truth of His unity will be revealed and manifest. Accordingly, if any aspect of these details is lacking, the overall intention – the revelation of this unity – remains unfulfilled.
<b>For in this way, everything in creation exists only for the glory of the Creator. This is the intent of the verse, “God has made everything for His own purpose” (Proverbs 16:4).</b> As I told you above, the common purpose of all the creations is for the sake of the Supreme Glory. <b>In this are included all the creations, the good and the bad...</b> For the unity is revealed through the good creations because the good in them is strengthened, just as it is revealed through the bad ones, because despite the fact that they are bad, they have to return to good.
<b>...for everything is only one system and one single existence of a creation...</b> For in accordance with the overall purpose as we have explained it, we can call everything that exists from the world of Nekudim and below one single existence such that all the different levels that we will discuss are nothing but parts of this overall existence<b> ...that completes the revelation of the unity... </b>For all existence in all its parts is necessary in order for the Supreme Unity to be revealed to perfection. <b>...and glory of Eyn Sof blessed be He.</b> For this is the definition of this entire matter: it is an existence made for the glory of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, whereby to reveal the glory of His unity.

Chapter 40

<i>The connection of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah with Atzilut at their root in Nekudim</i>
<b>This general material had to divide up into its constituent details, and then, first of all, there was the general basic foundation, which is called Atzilut with its three garments. Afterwards, control passed successively to each garment by itself, and they were called the three worlds of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. For Atzilut, as arranged with its proper repairs and adornments, is the root of everything, while Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah serve to bring forth the offshoots of Atzilut. Each one individually brings forth the offshoot suited to it, and all of them are merely offshoots of what already exists in Atzilut.</b>
<i>Having explained how the world of Nekudim is one material that has to divide up into its details, we will now discuss how it divides up.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: This general material...</b> This is the general principle relating to the division of the material into its details. <b>Part 2: For Atzilut...</b> This explains the reason behind this.
<b>Part 1: This general material had to divide up into its constituent details...</b> For at the start of existence there was only the material. Afterwards (in the repair), it was necessary to give existence to each detail by itself (i.e. to each Partzuf in accordance with its unique aspect) in accordance with its function and its appropriate form.
<b>...and then, first of all, there was the general basic foundation...</b> This first material consists of all the lights of SaG emerging from the eyes of Adam Kadmon, for these are what we are discussing. (The lights of Nekudim are the lights of SaG of SaG, which came after the lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth, these being AV of SaG. From SaG of SaG emerged the lowest aspect – BaN of SaG of SaG.)
In order to ensure the complete emergence of every detail from this material, it was necessary that all the entities that exist in the upper and lower realms be included, for it was from this material or substance that they were all made, as stated earlier. However, the first thing that had to emerge as the material began to divide into its particulars according to the unfolding sequence of the governmental order was a single, overall, general power that would include everything as one. Some of the details included in this would be there as the essence (i.e. Atzilut) while the others (i.e. Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah) would be secondary to it in order to enable it to fulfill its purpose.
This entire initial division within the overall material is called only a single detail, for the overall purpose is accomplished (i.e. after the repair) precisely through the institution of a single law as the foundation, with the others being secondary to it. (What was determined here was only which one is fundamental and which are secondary, not the individual details contained in each one.) See the difference between this basic foundation (the establishment of what is fundamental and what is secondary) and the general material. The general material includes all the laws of government and all the creations complete with everything they require (just as the seed contains the tiniest details of the complete tree), whereas this basic foundation is not an undifferentiated generality. Rather, it consists of one aspect as the essential root while the other is secondary to it and comes to complete its purpose. (The general material contains all the individual details while at the stage of formless material – just as the seed contains all the details of the tree – whereas the first foundation includes only the category of essential/secondary.)
<b>...which is called Atzilut with its three garments.</b> Thus Atzilut is primary, while its three garments are secondary, and the separate creations follow them.
<b>Afterwards, control passed successively to each garment by itself...</b> This completes the function of the general material, which includes all the different parts in accordance with their intrinsic nature. This includes the provision that each garment should rule by itself and do what is in its power. (This is also part of the overall governmental order leading to the ultimate purpose, and is therefore included in the general material.) For everything the garment does is merely one necessary provision included with everything else that can be discerned in the totality of the governmental order constituted by Atzilut with all its branches.
<b>...and they were called the three worlds of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah.</b> As already mentioned earlier (Openings 31 &amp; 38), everything which is given power and control by itself acquires its own name and reveals its powers separately. However, when it is secondary to others, it is not called by a separate name but is considered as merely a small part of the others in which it is included.
<b>Part 2: For Atzilut, as arranged with its proper repairs and adornments...</b> In order to perform its functions, it requires everything that is in it, and also that it be clothed in its garments. <b>...is the root of everything...</b> For the function of Atzilut is the initial preparation of everything that has to exist with all their different levels and all their various institutions and repairs.
<b>...while Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah serve to bring forth the offshoots of Atzilut. </b>This is the defining quality of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah – that they execute the functions of Atzilut. <b>Each one individually brings forth the offshoot suited to it...</b> i.e. they execute and actualize the functions of Atzilut, each world according to its individual nature, institutions and level of existence. And things proceed stage by stage on a scale, for the power produced by Yetzirah is less than that produced by Beriyah. But besides their different levels, each has its own individual aspects and produces offshoots in accordance with its intrinsic nature. (For example, besides the fact that Yetzirah in itself is a level lower than that of Beriyah, it has its own unique aspects, such as angels.) But their strength is considered on a relative scale.
<b>...and all of them are merely offshoots of what already exists in Atzilut.</b> For literally nothing new is added to them and anything they contain is only a derivative of something included as a facet of Atzilut.

Chapter 41

<i>The connection of the Line with the Residue – the soul and the body – becomes complete only after the emergence of evil and its return to good.</i>
<b>This general foundation had to receive its light initially through the mystery of the Line joining with the Residue. First, however, it had to be completed, because this was the whole reason why the Tzimtzum took place – in order to bring into existence a place for evil, so that it could be rectified and ultimately become good. Accordingly the light, which is from the Eyn Sof, blessed be He, must also wait until the vessel is completed, since this is where the root of evil lies. Only afterwards will it shine in it, and then everything will be complete. Accordingly, at first the light was not joined with the vessels but became hidden above, until the vessels completed their purpose, which is to provide a place for evil to rule and also complete its rule. Its repair will then come, turning everything back to good, and then the light will shine in it.</b>
<i>Further to our discussion of the Nekudim and what they comprise, we must explain what happened to them when they came into being and were negated.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: This general foundation...</b> This explains the way the light had to join with the vessels as required by the governmental order. <b>Part 2: Accordingly, at first the light was not joined...</b> This explains how the connection actually came about in accordance with this requirement.
<b>Part 1: This general foundation had to receive its light...</b> For all the details emerging from the first material were aspects of the Residue in the category of vessels. Afterwards they would have to receive their inner face or light (פנימיות, <i>pnimiyut</i>) in the category of the Line, as explained earlier (see Opening 27). <b>...initially...</b> For the first to emerge from the material was this (i.e. the category of vessels). Immediately after it came forth, it had to fulfill its purpose in accordance with the underlying mystery of this light. <b>...through the mystery of the Line joining with the Residue.</b> For it has already been explained how on all levels the governmental order is established on the foundation of the Residue, and how the Line joins with it to rule over them in accordance with the nature of the Residue (see Opening 29).
<b>First, however, it had to be completed...</b> For you have already heard how the Line and the Residue are the root of the soul and the body. Accordingly, we will first explain the matter in relation to the body and the soul. This body is a coarse body, and all aspects of evil  – every kind of sin and evil trait – are also rooted in it. The soul, however, is pure, except that it is closed in this body, which separates it from the supreme light, and the soul itself is unable to shine its light properly. The soul’s function in the body is to cleanse it and purify it of its coarseness. The essence of the return of evil to good is that what was evil should be rectified and turned to good, so that the soul itself may shine out of it. The soul will then be primary and its radiance will spread as befits it, and the soul will be attached to the supreme light, delighting in it together with the body.
Now the root of all this above lies in the Line and the Residue, as stated earlier. The Residue (the root of the body) is a certain measure born out of the concealment of God’s perfection and unity, upon which all the different aspects of judgment, including all the different aspects of evil, as explained above, depend (see Opening 27). This is the way the worlds were created. This is not an aspect of perfection; on the contrary, it is the concealment of perfection. Clearly, the complete perfection of the Supreme Will is far away from this, and His perfect light does not reach it in a manifest way.
The Line, on the other hand, is the root of the soul, and it proceeds through the power of His unity to rule over all parts of the Residue, ultimately proving that everything that appears to be the opposite of truth through the power of the concealment actually turns around to show the real truth and reveal His supreme unity. This will come about in actuality when the world comes to complete perfection, when all evil will already have reverted to good, this being the function of the Line. The Residue will then no longer be something that repels the Supreme Perfection. On the contrary, what will show the power of His true perfection is precisely the repair of all the apparent defects seen in the world through the revelation of His unity.
We have already explained that it is the repair of the Residue by the Line that brings the perfection which was seen even at the outset in the Supreme Will. However, this is the actual revelation of that perfection in all its details. It is then that the supreme perfection reaches the Line and the Residue, which are the light that creates the worlds, until the worlds created from them come to enjoy His eternal perfection, and this is eternity (נצחיות, <i>nitzchiyut</i>).
The way this perfection comes to the Line and the Residue is similar to the way the supreme light has to reach the soul, having been held back because of the body’s unrectified state. But afterwards the light does reach the soul when the body is repaired (after the resurrection). It is known that the main thing is the unity, i.e. the Line, which is like a soul shining with all its lights in the body, so that the perfect unity is revealed properly in all its aspects. And just as the body is secondary to the soul, and is purified and radiant, so the Residue is secondary to the Line, and it is already rectified, because evil no longer comes forth from it, but on the contrary, it stands to reveal the perfection of His unity by showing how the deficiencies were rectified through the power of that unity. (When the Residue is rectified, it too reveals the unity.) It is then evident that despite the great power of evil, it is one small matter that the Eyn Sof, blessed be He, wanted to display in order to demonstrate His perfection so that all existence may delight in Him through seeing the deficiencies that would exist were it not for the unity of His perfection and the repair accomplished by His perfect unity.
You can see this entire matter in the soul and the body, for the connection which the soul has to make with the body is the perfect, enduring connection that will exist after the resurrection. The essential intent of the creation is literally this: if Adam had not sinned, his body would have been pure and it would have been rectified in a single moment. However, after his sin, the impurity was in man’s body, and the soul cannot join with it in a perfect connection. On the contrary, the soul leaves the body: this is death. The body is then alone and brings out all the evil contained in it, and that evil rules and holds sway until the body finishes bringing out all the evil it has to bring out. The body can then be rebuilt in purity. This will take place with the resurrection of the dead, when the body is rebuilt. The soul will then enter and remain in the body without a flaw for ever and to all eternity, radiating light after light to it, until it ascends to the highest level suited to it. Even at the outset, when the soul was in the body before death, it also gave it a certain light. Indeed, the light which the soul puts into the body after the resurrection is in accordance with the light which the soul puts into it before death, for each one is purified and radiates according to his deeds.
All this is found above in the Line and the Residue. Before the Line could be joined with the Residue in a genuine connection that would cause everything to go in one direction, the Residue had to be allowed to do everything in its power – i.e. to actually bring forth any evil that could develop out of it, so that afterwards it will be pure of this evil, as will be discussed below. The Line will then join with it in a complete bond, as when it first entered into it, and just as it shone before the breaking of the vessels, so it will shine afterwards with their rectification.
When the vessels are purified of the evil, the Line will radiate within them and its radiation will successively become stronger and stronger until everything will be completely purified, inaugurating the destined perfect repair at the end of everything. We thus see that the light cannot join with the Residue until it is complete in the sense of having brought forth evil and having also been purified from it.
<b>...because this was the whole reason why the Tzimtzum took place – in order to bring into existence a place for evil, so that it can be rectified and ultimately become good.</b> Even the natural order of things requires that the Line should not be joined with the Residue except after it has been cleansed and purified of evil, because they are levels resulting from the first Tzimtzum. As discussed earlier, it was the Tzimtzum – out of which the Residue developed – that instituted this pattern whereby evil emerged at the outset and would afterwards have to revert to good. The Residue can therefore only be said to have fulfilled its purpose if it produces evil, which then stands waiting to revert to good. If so, a genuine connection between the Line and the Residue can only exist after it has brought forth evil, which can afterwards be rectified through the mystery of the return to good. For after the Residue is complete, the Line that comes after it begins to hold sway.
The objection could be raised that if so, the light should only enter after the process of purification. The answer is that the entry of the light and its becoming joined with the Residue are two different things. On the contrary, as far as entering is concerned, the light can enter immediately. However, it must allow the Residue to hold sway until the Residue fulfills its mission so as not to undermine its functioning in the middle. This is why the Line joins with the Residue so as to actually purify it and raise it to its highest levels only after it has fulfilled its mission. Yet it must start to radiate from the outset, as discussed below (Opening 42).
<b>Accordingly the light, which is from the Eyn Sof, blessed be He, must also wait until the vessel is completed, since this is where the root of evil lies. Only afterwards will it shine in it...</b> This is for the reason I have explained, for this is the proper order. For it was the Tzimtzum that was an innovation, while Eyn Sof wanted to reveal His prior existence – to make it known that this innovation was only a concealment which He desired in order to demonstrate His very perfection, as already discussed in various places. It was therefore necessary to wait until the Tzimtzum carried out its function, and then go to return everything to His unity, and through all of this to show His perfection.
<b>...and then everything will be complete.</b> In other words, to complete the desired labor in its entirety requires all of this: that the Tzimtzum should carry out everything in its power, and not only this, but that at the end of everything produced by the Tzimtzum, the light of Eyn Sof, blessed be He, should shine, as explained above.
<b>Part 2: Accordingly, at first the light was not joined with the vessels...</b> In other words, what actually happened was that the light became hidden above. For although it entered, it was unable to join with it but went back and became hidden, as it goes on to say: <b>...but became hidden above...</b> This is like the way the soul stands above in the Garden of Eden all the time that the body is being purified in the earth, bringing out the evil from it. Even from above, the soul radiates what it must to the body during this time (i.e. הבלא דגרמי, <i>hevla degarmei</i>, the “vapor of the bones”). And so it is with these vessels, as will be discussed below (see Opening 54).
Indeed, the light’s becoming “hidden” – whether we are talking about the light above or about the soul after the death of the body – means that it is concealed in a pure place where the Other Side has no hold, like a person taking refuge somewhere while waiting for a certain matter to come to a conclusion, and in the meantime he has a place to stay. So too the soul in the Garden of Eden and the lights above are gathered into a resting place where no harm can befall them until what is necessary takes place in the vessels and in the body.
<b>...until the vessels completed their mission...</b> i.e. until they carry out everything rooted in their intrinsic law of existence. <b>...which is to provide a place for evil to rule and also complete its rule.</b> For all these levels are fixed in the law of the vessels, as explained above. <b>Its repair will then come, turning everything back to good, and then the light will shine in it.</b> This is when the lights re-enter later in the time of the repair, as will be discussed below.

Chapter 42

<i>The light joins with the vessels according to the degree of their repair, which will be completed in the future.</i>
<b>The repair of the vessels proceeded little by little, and according to the degree to which they were repaired, so the light progressively entered into them. Their repair will be complete in the future, as will the entry of the light and its joining with them.</b>
<i>Having explained that the light entered only with the repair of the vessels, we must now explain how its entry actually came about.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The repair of the vessels...</b> This explains the process of the repair of the vessels until now. <b>Part 2: Their repair will be complete...</b> This explains what is destined to happen in the future in order for the vessels to complete their purpose.
<b>Part 1: The repair of the vessels proceeded little by little...</b> For to say that the light enters into the vessel only when it is purified could be problematic; yet we know that so far the process of purification after the breaking of the vessels is still not complete (see Opening 37). If so, how could lights enter into the vessels even after the start of the repair if the process of purification is not complete?
The answer is that the repair did not come about all at once but gradually. It started when the phase of repair first began, and advances stage by stage with every passing day through the ever-renewed process of sorting and sifting that takes place each day. The greater the repair, the more the light is able to enter, as the proposition goes on to state:
<b>...and according to the degree to which they were repaired, so the light progressively entered into them.</b> For as soon as the body is rebuilt after the resurrection of the dead, the soul will immediately enter into it and start to join with it. Nevertheless, many ascents will still remain to be made before it reaches the end goal. Thus we see that the ability of the soul to enter and join with the body depends upon the degree to which the body is purified. First it must be purified from uncleanliness (through the “torment of the grave”) and afterwards from even the slightest residual trace of uncleanliness (after the resurrection of the dead), and this process involves many details. Each time the soul will shine with added luster.
So it is in the upper realms: first the light entered, but it had to leave again. Afterwards, parts of the vessels were repaired and the lights began to enter into them. As more and more parts of the vessel are repaired, so the light enters more and more. And when the process of purification is complete in all parts of the vessel, all the light will enter completely. However, the process of refinement of the vessels after their purification follows the order of the destined future ascents of the lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth.
<b>Part 2: The repair will be complete in the future...</b> As already explained above (Opening 4), evil will only revert to good in time to come, at the end of the governmental cycle. By then all the sinners will have received heavy punishments and Israel will have been strengthened in their faith that even the lengthy exile and this great bitterness are a call for the unity of God to be revealed. Accordingly, it will be at the end of the rule of the Residue, when these things come about, that the purification of the vessels will come to an end, for this is what subdues evil and finally turns it back to good, and this is through Israel’s great faith despite the long exile.
<b>...as will the entry of the light and its joining with them.</b> Thus the light will complete its entry into the vessels and join with them to perfection, concluding the destined future ascents.

Chapter 43

<i>The root of actual evil lies in Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah.</i>
<b>Evil was rooted only in the mystery of the garments of Atzilut, these being Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. Therefore, in order to complete them, they had to be differentiated into all their detailed aspects in such a way that they would first provide a place for evil in accordance with what was prepared in them, and then eventually come back to repair all the damage.</b>
<i>The full explanation of the world of Nekudim must follow the order of what happened to these vessels. This is what we must now discuss in greater detail, with our main focus being on how evil was rooted in them.</i>
The proposition contains two parts. <b>Part 1: Evil was rooted only in...</b> This explains where the root of evil lay. <b>Part 2: Therefore, in order to complete them...</b> This explains what these vessels had to contain in order to carry out their function.
<b>Part 1: Evil was rooted...</b> For Atzilut itself consists of nothing but the laws and measures of the divine Mind (המחשבה, <i>hamachshavah</i>), these being the Sefirot. However, the production of the branches (i.e. the separate creatures) depends on Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. As explained earlier (in Opening 39, Part 2) there are two roots. The first is a root that produces branches of the same kind as the root itself (i.e. the branches of Atzilut itself, which are all on the level of Godliness). The second is a root that produces branches that are not of the same kind as the root itself – i.e. the separate creatures. (This second root is the power of <i>Tzur Tak</i>, which brings forth its “branches” in the form of the separate creatures in each world in accordance with the root of that world in Atzilut. The roots of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah in Atzilut are respectively Imma, Zeir Anpin and Nukva of Atzilut.)<br> Since there are two roots, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah must in each case first come forth on the level of its root in Atzilut, and only afterwards, through the second root, the power of <i>Tzur Tak</i>, as a realm of separate creations. We may thus infer that actual evil itself exists only in the branches of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah – the separate creations – and not in the branches of Atzilut, which are on the level Godliness itself, where evil is not applicable.
<b>...only in the mystery of the garments of Atzilut, these being Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah.</b> This tells us two things:
(1) In the human form – the Likeness of Man – the thing that is most external is the clothing. The same applies up above. Morever, the clothing is not a part of the person’s intrinsic essence but merely what he wishes to dress himself in. Similarly up above, the essence of the lights lies in Atzilut, whereas Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are the garments in which the light wants to clothe itself, and the garb is considered incidental to the actual lights, which are the essence. Evil exists only on account of the garments and does not derive from the essence of the lights themselves but only from the garments in which the lights want to be clothed. Aside from these garments, they contain no darkness or flaw at all.
(2) Even though evil derives only from Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, it is nonetheless considered to relate to Atzilut itself inasmuch as these worlds are the garments of Atzilut. If they were simply independent worlds in their own right lower down the scale, Atzilut would be exalted high above them and would not be considered to have any relation with them. However, inasmuch as they are the garments of Atzilut and subsidiary to it in order to complete it, the production of evil is also considered to have some relation to Atzilut.
<b>Part 2: Therefore, in order to complete them...</b> As explained above, in order for the vessels to carry out their purpose in full, all these things were required: <b>...they had to be differentiated...</b> It was not enough that they should remain in the category of garments to Atzilut, for as such they are merely subsidiary and their specific purpose would not be accomplished in the proper way. The production of evil comes about through their functioning individually when they are given control, since everything is only from their side, as stated above. If so, it is necessary for them to stop being mere garments and to take control, for this is when they carry out their functions and produce evil.
<b>...into all their detailed aspects...</b> It was necessary for them to bring forth all the different kinds of detailed particulars contained in them, and everything that now exists in the worlds depends on this, as it goes on to say.
<b>...in such a way that they would first provide a place for evil...</b> This was the whole purpose of their being broken. <b>...in accordance with what was prepared in them...</b> In other words, everything that happened when the vessels broke came to reveal what those garments contained in order to fulfill their function of producing evil.<b> ...and then eventually come back to repair all the damage.</b> This refers to everything that is directed towards the repair, i.e. the entry of the light into the vessels, for this too relates to the vessels themselves.

Chapter 44

<i>Why the specific root of the Other Side lies in the world of Nekudim</i>
<b>The lights do not produce their effects until they stand on a level suited to them. For a great light cannot be called the cause of a single small creation since the latter will never emerge directly from the former, because the Emanator, blessed be His Name, instituted the law of gradation. Accordingly, the Judgment that was revealed in the Residue did not reach a level where it could in any way be called the cause of the Other Side until it came to produce the Vessel in Nekudim. For higher than this we find nothing that relates to any aspect of the Other Side at all. However in Nekudim something is revealed that does bear some relation to the function of the Other Side. For here alone is the general foundation consisting of all these worlds of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, which extend to the level of material physicality and to the end of all existence.</b>
<i>Having stated that these Sefirot contained the root of evil, we must now explain what this root is.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The lights do not produce...</b> This explains when a given light can rightly be called the cause of a given phenomenon. <b>Part 2: Accordingly, the Judgment... </b>This explains how this applies in the subject under consideration.
<b>Part 1: The lights do not produce their effects until they stand on a level suited to them.</b> Here we have the fundamental idea underlying everything we discussed in the early Openings, that in choosing the law of gradation, the Supreme Will wanted every light to stand on a level corresponding to that of its offspring, because this is the way of what we call cause and effect. The cause operates only according to what it contains within it, and the effect emerges only according to the nature of the cause. This idea is of key importance here in Nekudim, for it is here that we must trace the root of evil in its various aspects, because only here is this root mentioned (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar HaKelipot</i> ch. 1 and <i>Mevo Shearim</i> 2:2:2). This is only because of the law of gradation, for all the earlier levels were proceeding towards this goal, but only here did they reach the necessary level.
The fundamental idea is that even though the purpose of the lights as a whole was to bring forth separate creations, this had to be done gradually and not directly from the supernal Sefirot. The Sefirot were what the Eyn Sof blessed be He wanted to bring forth in order to create the separate creations. However, each one had to be on a level suited to the offspring it was to bring forth. This was what necessitated all the different graded levels, repairs, concealments and revelations – all in order to bring the light to a level fitted to bring forth its offspring.
<b>For a great light cannot be called the cause of a single small creation since the latter will never emerge directly from the former...</b> Even though “two hundred include one hundred” and the higher level includes the lower level, the higher level is not called a cause since it is not from there that the effect develops. <b>...because the Emanator, blessed be His Name, instituted the law of gradation.</b> As explained above (Opening 30) we cannot say that it was impossible for the Emanator to do otherwise. However, since He wanted gradation, this is what gradation involves.
<b>Part 2: Accordingly, the Judgment that was revealed in the Residue did not reach a level where it could in any way be called the cause of the Other Side...</b> This is the reason why there is no mention of a root of the Other Side except in the case of Nekudim, even though Judgment (דין, <i>din</i>) had already been revealed above. However the Judgment above was not on a level that bears any relation to that of the Other Side in any way at all.
<b>...until it came to produce the Vessel...</b> For you have already heard that the root of evil lies in the vessels, just as in the case of man’s body, since the vessel is the cause of the body, as discussed earlier. <b>...in Nekudim.</b> I.e. <i>not</i> in Akudim (the lights of the Mouth of Adam Kadmon), because although a vessel existed there too, it did not rule (for the vessel was entirely subsidiary to the lights) and it did not become differentiated into its details (since it was only one vessel with ten lights). Accordingly it was not yet called a root to the Other Side. But as soon as it became revealed in all its constituent details and took control – namely, in the world of Nekudim – it reached a suitable level.
<b>For higher than this we find nothing that relates to any aspect of the Other Side at all. However in Nekudim something is revealed that does bear some relation to the function of the Other Side.</b> The proof that only here can we speak in terms of a root to the Other Side is because beyond this level we see nothing whatever relating to its function, whereas here aspects relating to the function of the Other Side were immediately evident. Even if the higher levels were a remote cause, this was not revealed and visible in the least. Here, however, we know immediately that it is so. What it is that is seen here that relates to the function of the Other Side will be discussed later.
<b>For here alone is the general foundation consisting of all these worlds of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, which extend to the level of material physicality and to the end of all existence.</b> The two overall roots that I mentioned above, the lights of the Sefirot and <i>Tzur Tak</i> (see Openings 39 &amp; 43), comprise all the separate realms and beings and even material physicality and the Other Side <b>…to the end of all existence.</b>
Let me explain: Not only do we see that it actually happened this way – that here was revealed what was not revealed on the earlier levels; more than this, it is clearly understandable why this root (of the Other Side) specifically relates to the world of Nekudim. This is because it is here that we find the overall foundation of all these separate creations, all of which were measured and calculated individually in detail from beginning to end, including even the Other Side. This was not the case in the worlds that came before, which were only the law instituting that separate creations would emerge but without existence as yet being differentiated into its constituent details. And although it was concealed in this law that the Other Side should also come into being, since this too was included with the rest of existence, there was as yet no trace or mention of it. In Nekudim, however, where everything divided up into particulars, this detail also became visible.
We may thus infer that the Other Side itself is included in the Nekudim inasmuch as they include all the separate creations, because Nekudim is the overall category containing the two roots explained above (see Openings 39 and 43). Thus the lights can now be said to be standing on a level suited to that of the separate creations, for the latter had now been calculated in all their details precisely as they are and not otherwise. The power of Judgment likewise stood ready, calculating the details of the Other Side as well. This is why the Nekudim contain the root of evil, because as already explained earlier in relation to the mystery of “sparks and flashes” (see Opening 36), Nekudim goes only on the principle of the underlying unity in all that exists, which is revealed through the mystery of evil reverting to good. For this involves the existence of the Other Side and the repair of everything afterwards.

Chapter 45

<i>Evil was rooted at the end of the vessel, so that when the light reached there, the vessel broke.</i>
<b>Only in the lowest parts of the vessels was this faint trace of the root of the Other Side evident. Thus initially the overall light entered and continued spreading in accordance with the mystery of the general foundation until it reached these lowly parts. These are none other than the garments, which are considered the feet of Atzilut. Accordingly, as long as the lights did not reach them, there was no breakage. It was when they reached there that breakage took place. They then turned around and departed from even the highest parts.</b>
<i>Having stated that there was a revelation of the Other Side in these Nekudim, we will now indicate the particular place where this occurred.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: Only in the lowest parts...</b> This is the place designated for this root. <b>Part 2: Thus initially the overall light entered...</b> This explains what happened as a result.
<b>Part 1: Only in the lowest parts of the vessels...</b> There is no place for a root for evil except in the lowest parts of any given level. This is because the various parts of a given level are also arranged on a scale, one under the other, like subspecies of an overall category. The last function of all of them is the production of evil, which is the lowest of all in status and whose function is less than that of the others in terms of control and government.
<b>...was this faint trace of the root of the Other Side evident.</b> This is the trace we mentioned above, that is evident in the Nekudim, and it will be explained below.
<b>Part 2: Thus initially the overall light entered...</b> This is the light suitable for the General Foundation, which consists of all that is contained in Nekudim – Atzilut with its three garments. Just as this foundation is general, so is the light.
<b>...and continued spreading in accordance with the mystery of the general foundation until it reached these lowly parts.</b> For the breaking did not take place in the vessels immediately, for it is written that they “ruled” (Genesis 36:31ff). Rather, the light continued spreading to their lowest level, and during all that time they had rule. Only when the lights reached the lowest level where this root lay did the break-up occur in the vessels, as explained below.
<b>These are none other than the garments, which are considered the feet of Atzilut.</b> For we have already discussed above (Opening 31) how all of the various orders are included under the order of the Ten Sefirot. Thus even though the body itself is a complete array of Ten Sefirot, when we also consider its garments with it, the body is like nine Sefirot and the garment stands as their Malchut, the tenth Sefirah.
<b>Accordingly, as long as the lights did not reach them, there was no breakage. It was when they reached there that breakage took place. They then turned around and departed from even the highest parts.</b> For then the Mind decreed that since it was impossible for the light to be joined with the vessel because of this aspect contained in the vessel, it would be best to allow the vessel to do all in its power, and then afterwards the light would enter into it and be joined with it in a perfect bond.

Chapter 46

<i>The fall and breaking of the vessels – to produce evil</i>
<b>When it was necessary to give control to the garments by themselves in order for them to be repaired, the highest part that was contained in Nekudim became concealed, this being their Atzilut, and then the garments ruled by themselves. This is called a fall for them, for they had fallen from having been included in Atzilut as its garments and were now ruling by themselves, not in a state of order and repair but in one of damage and destruction, empty of all the lights that had distanced themselves from them. In this state they were all the time intent on providing a place for evil to emerge and exist, in order that it should be rectified in the end.</b>
<i>Having discussed these garments and how they needed to rule in order to produce evil, we will now explain what this rule entailed.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: When it was necessary to give control...</b> This explains how the garments ruled. <b>Part 2: This is called a fall for them...</b> This explains why their rule is called a fall.
<b>Part 1: When it was necessary to give control to the garments by themselves...</b> As I wrote above, the root of evil lay only in the function carried out by the garments during the time of their rule, when they were considered worlds in their own right. For it is said of all that stands in Atzilut, “Evil will not dwell with You” (Psalms 5:5). Now since the intention was to produce evil, it was necessary for these garments to rule, and then they would produce it.
<b>...in order for them to be repaired...</b> This too is as I wrote above (Opening 41) that all this was necessary for the sake of the eventual repair. For as long as the actual damage had not occurred so as to prepare things to be repaired through the mystery of the return of evil to good, the light (of the new MaH) could not come (so as to return to the vessels after they broke). On the contrary, it was precisely for this purpose that the light was concealed – to  allow the vessels to carry out this function.
<b>...the highest part that was contained in Nekudim became concealed, this being their Atzilut...</b> For after the emanation of the lights of Atzilut, the function of these worlds (after the repair) would be to draw those lights down to the outside for the sake of the lower realms and beings. Each one then takes what it takes from Atzilut and channels it to its proper place, and this is the rectified order. However, this was not the intention now (in Nekudim). For what was necessary now was to establish the existence of these worlds in and of themselves so that they would afterwards be suited to perform their appropriate function, which is to draw from Atzilut.
This can be compared to a system of pipes or channels taking water from a river in order to conduct it to various different locations. When each pipe takes its proper share of water to bring it to its proper place, this is the rectified order. However, during the process of preparation and installation of the actual channels themselves – to produce vessels that will afterwards serve as pipes to channel the water from the river – the river is of no relevance. Quite the contrary: the river must not be allowed to flow into the pipes: it is as if they are not its pipes. And indeed, as long as they are being built away from the river, they are not its pipes. Rather, they are vessels that are under construction in order to serve as pipes for the river later on.
So too here, when Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are with Atzilut after having been built, each one receives from Atzilut so as to channel its influence outwards. However, during the process of their actual construction, Atzilut is of no relevance. On the contrary, Atzilut is concealed, leaving them as unfinished vessels that are built successively, little by little, until everything depending on their structure is complete, so that they may afterwards serve as channels for Atzilut.
Accordingly, now that it was necessary to produce the things that depended on their existence – i.e. to bring forth evil so as afterwards to restore what was damaged to a state of repair, as discussed above – Atzilut was concealed from this process, since it had no connection with it. These worlds thus remained alone on their own as part of the process of becoming steadily more defined on the way to their rectification. For Atzilut has no part or share whatever in the production of evil, and its light can only be drawn down by way of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah when they are rectified to serve as its channels.
<b>...and then the garments ruled by themselves.</b> During that time, they cannot be considered the feet of Atzilut, and instead of being the feet as they had been, they were left as worlds on their own.
<b>Part 2: This is called a fall for them...</b> Although the orderly array of the worlds (in their rectified state) entails that Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah should initially be garments of Atzilut and afterwards worlds in themselves, the process we are discussing was not like this. Rather, it is called a fall – i.e. the death of the kings. <b>...for they had fallen from having been included in Atzilut as its garments and were now ruling by themselves...</b> The order in which they spread forth (after the Tikkun) is that Atzilut remains, while it is the garments that extend in the sense that control is given to each one of them to draw its share from Atzilut, as stated above. Here, however, Atzilut is concealed, and the garments do not channel its influence in an orderly way. Rather, it is a fall for them because it was not that they spread forth but rather that Atzilut departed. After having previously been the feet and garments of Atzilut, they were then left as the worlds of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah on their own, since they lacked the body which they had been clothing.
Thus in the order in which things developed, they are garments in one aspect, but afterwards, during their period of rule, they are considered in a different category and then they are “worlds”. However, here it is the very aspect that was previously in the category of garments that remains as worlds, since they lack the aspect of being garments inasmuch as they lack the body that is being clothed, as stated above. And this is only because they now need to be built in order to be able afterwards to serve as garments to Atzilut in this way, and then they will serve in their proper function.
You must likewise understand that their rule now cannot be compared to the rule they have when they are rectified with Atzilut. For when they are rectified with Atzilut, the purpose of their rule is to channel the lights of Atzilut to the lower creations. But their rule (in Nekudim) is not like this, for they then rule with parts of their own, and they have no connection with Atzilut at all. (The vessels are then cut off from the lights remaining in Atzilut.) They actually rule with parts of their own – revealing their individual powers and functions as they are when built, in order to bring forth the various aspects of evil swallowed up among these powers...
<b>...not in a state of order and repair but in one of damage and destruction...</b> This is the breaking we speak about, because falling and breaking are two different things. When we speak of falling, it means that they fell from their high level to a lower level. When we speak about breaking, it means that they did not rule with an orderly balance of their various parts, but rather in a destructive way, generating all the different kinds of damage that evil causes when it rules. For as you have already heard, the breaking of the vessels means that the powers of destruction took control, damaging them and causing all the different kinds of damage and evil that can exist in the world. On the upper level, these are all the different kinds of flaws and damage that can exist in the supernal lights. For the vessels in their broken state constitute the measure of all the different kinds of damage that can exist, because what was not calculated at the outset could not come into being afterwards.
<b>...empty of all the lights that had distanced themselves from them.</b> This very deficiency also gives them the power to perform their intended function in this broken state. For the light is the mystery of the unity that turns all evil to good. Here, however, the intention was to produce evil as such, and what gives added power to these vessels to carry out this function is precisely the fact that the light distances itself from them so that they descend bereft of light. This means that in this phase they are not governed by the light. On the contrary, it is precisely from the intense concealment of the light that this fragmentation derives. They then direct themselves entirely to the purpose of bringing forth evil. And in truth nothing caused such a concealment of perfection as the fact that the light disdained even to enter into the vessel. The vessel was then left ruling only in its aspect of harsh judgment.
<b>In this state they were all the time intent on providing a place for evil to emerge and exist...</b> For since they were now completely distanced from perfection, they were left intent only on producing evil, and everything was directed to this purpose alone.
<b>...in order that it should be rectified in the end.</b> Nevertheless the intention was not merely to produce evil, for the ultimate distant intention was only for the sake of repair. Accordingly, you will see that in any event the light did not altogether cease shining from afar to the vessels. Even when it did not shine at all, which is when the fall came about – a great fall – nevertheless there were the 288 sparks that descended with the vessels. For on the contrary, the final and ultimate intention was only to turn this great destruction into a total, perfect repair.

Chapter 47

<i>The repair of the vessels from evil, albeit incomplete</i>
<b>When the Emanator, blessed be He, wanted to rectify these garments, He selected and cleansed their various levels, one by one, so that instead of being directed towards evil they would turn around to evade it. Each level in turn then left the task of producing evil to the level below it. The upper level thus had a share in this, except that it was in the process of evading and being cleansed of it, and it was then fit to receive light. The same happened on each successive level in relation to the level below it, until all the levels of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah were cleansed, as they are now, and they then left the task of producing evil to the lowest of all levels, that of Malchut of Asiyah. They were then all ready to receive the light except for this last level, because the light can only spread in a vessel that is cleansed of evil.</b>
<b>All this is called only the repair of the garments of Nekudim. To the extent that the vessels were repaired, so the light would successively enter into them. The more remote the level of a given vessel from anything that has to do with evil, the greater the light it was fit to receive. However, the first Atzilut was not revealed again, for the repair of all these garments cannot be called complete as long as this lowest level is still directed to the production of evil and thus devoid of the light.</b>
<i>When a person wants to attain a deep understanding of a given subject, he should start by gaining a sufficient overall picture of the entire subject from beginning to end and then go into the details. The reason for this is simple: the end goal of the completed project is present in the mind from the very outset, and all the early stages in the execution of the project are carried out in accordance with the initial intention, which is directed to what is to come later. If so, it is impossible to understand those initial stages and their purpose except through knowing what comes after them, since their purpose is to lead to what follows them. This applies to every stage until the execution of the project is complete, for everything is done for the sake of the end goal.</i>
<i>We thus see that the various actions performed are governed by what is intended through them. Yet what is intended through them is what comes after them: the final goal is the finished work that will come at the end of everything. If so, someone who wants to understand the purpose of the earlier actions must first understand the general direction until the end. Then afterwards he can go back to investigate the details. This way he will not have to remain in suspense until the end while seeking to understand the details of the early stages. When he already has a grasp of the overall direction, he will be able to understand each successive detail in its place. </i>
<i>Accordingly, having begun discussing the “garments” and how they were given independent control in order to bring out the evil from them so that they would afterwards be fit for the light to join with them, we must first explain the overall direction until the end, when things will reach a state of repair. By explaining this first, all the details we will discuss later in connection with the initial stages will be understandable in the light of the end goal.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: When the Emanator…</b> This explains the repair whereby the vessels could again receive their light. <b>Part 2: All this is called...</b> This explains that all this is only the process of the rectification of the garments, but not the complete repair.
<b>Part 1: When the Emanator, blessed be He, wanted to rectify these garments...</b> For the Primordial Kings remained broken for just as long as it took to let the powers of evil be revealed from them. To explain this more fully: Israel went down into exile and must remain there for as long as it takes for all the levels that exist in the evil which rules over them to unfold (until the people of Israel are rectified through suffering or until they overcome all the tests to their faith, such as idolatry, philosophy, secularism, etc.). In a similar way, these kings remained in their state of destruction for just as long a time – i.e. on just as many levels – as was required to produce the different divisions of evil. Then afterwards, the Supreme Will will be revealed and will repair everything through the mystery of unity, as explained above. For we see that evil is getting stronger every day, but the Supreme Will will put a stop to it in the end.
Now the root of all this lies in the Primordial Kings, and this is why they went down and broke, remaining broken in proportion to the increasing power of evil on its various levels. However, when the Supreme Will so desired, He put an end to this and repaired them again. In the same way, the people of Israel remain in exile for a given length of time, which is followed by their redemption. This is because the evil only exists until the powers of the Sefirot – the powers of the Likeness of Man – complete their mission. For the intention was as explained earlier: the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to show that while the Other Side has the power to raise a challenge against the entire power of the Sefirot, it cannot stand for even a moment against the power of His unity, which is in control, and this is the revelation of His unity, as explained above (see Opening 30, end).
And this is what was accomplished through these kings. For He allowed evil to hold sway against all the powers that depend on the Likeness of Man – the number of levels of evil corresponds exactly to the number of these powers – and accordingly He did not then reveal His unity. Things continued in the same way, and indeed the evil became ever stronger. But when these powers of the Sefirot were completed, He then revealed His will, wanting to rectify everything through the power of His rule.
From that point on (after the emergence of the Primordial Kings) the powers of evil were instituted, having already been revealed. Against every power in the Sefirot, there emerged corresponding powers of evil. Then afterwards the will (of unity) becomes revealed. So it is now, inasmuch as the Other Side holds sway on all its levels, which correspond directly to the levels of the Sefirot. However, the will is already set to be revealed at the end of these levels, and this is the day of redemption.
<b>...He selected and cleansed their various levels, one by one, so that instead of being directed towards evil...</b> For initially included in the law of these levels was the production of evil, i.e. the measures of the creations when in a state of disrepair, for this is the state in which the creations later came forth down below too, as it is written: “And the earth was desolate and void” (Genesis 1:2). First it was created and afterwards destroyed. In other words, it was created full of evil, until the evil in it came forth and actually destroyed it by not allowing anything to exist. Afterwards – “And God said, Let there be light” (<i>ibid</i>. 3). This was when the creations started being sifted and cleansed one by one.
Nevertheless, evil did not disappear from the world. However, each individual creation was not itself full of evil but rather, it was cleansed of the evil and was trying to evade and escape it, leaving evil subdued and humiliated. Yet since that creation was not completely repaired, the same evil could still return and attack and destroy it. However, this was not inevitable in the way it had been at first. For at first the evil was ready and waiting to attack, whereas now it remains sunk quietly in its place, although it could still be aroused. More than that, the hardest part of the evil, which caused the initial attack, is no more. For initially, not only did all the creations contain great evil but also, the various parts were not arranged in a way that would allow order to come about in actuality, and this itself was a great evil.
Afterwards, however, things were made in a graded order, for everything was arranged in a different way and a new, improved and better repaired mode of existence was given to the creations themselves. For while the first mode of existence (BaN) alone was the cause of this entire destruction, the second mode of existence (MaH) did not cause this. More than this, since the first mode of existence was also with it, this first mode itself became organized in a new order, so that instead of the evil parts waiting to emerge, they remain sunk inactive in their place. Thus the hard part – the lack of order – was gone, because order was introduced (through the ordering of the Sefirot in balanced columns and the construction of the Partzufim). Evil no longer stood ready to attack with such great power. On the contrary, the deepest intention was directed to making the remaining parts turn to good in the end.
Now all of this manifests itself down below, but the root of it all lies above. For the measure of all that exists is the governmental order. Initially the Sefirot were laws of government which included in them the production of evil as an actual reality so that afterwards, through its repair, God’s unity would be revealed. Accordingly, the intention in each individual level at the time of the fall, when control was given over to the garments, was to produce evil. They therefore still lacked the complete perfection that nullifies evil, because the intention was precisely that they should produce evil. And after having produced it, the evil itself was causing their own destruction in the sense that the good powers within them existed only in the mode of negation, powerless to function, while it was the powers of destruction that held sway.
Afterwards the Supreme Mind calculated the measure of the creations as they are when they emerge from the state of ruin, this measure being the forces of creation (הויות, <i>havayot</i>) that emerge from the destruction, and He gave them existence, each one by itself. The intention now was no longer to produce evil but quite the opposite, to depart from evil through the mystery of the Supreme Unity, whereby even though evil exists (since it serves to reveal the unity), the repair will come, this being the revelation of the unity that was concealed at first. However, not all the perfection was revealed at one time since this would have left no more evil in the world. Rather, the perfection was revealed little by little. Thus the creations which evil had been destroying began to endure, and the evil no longer destroyed them as at first. However, their existence was not entirely secure, because evil can still attack and damage them.
Understand the great difference between their initial state and this one. Initially, they were levels intended to produce evil, and it could be said that this purpose permeated every single part of them, because each part had to produce its corresponding evil. Now, however, as each level was repaired – in the sense of emerging from this task of producing evil – it stood to be rectified of the damage caused to it by the evil, except that evil did not disappear from the world, as stated above. If so, it means that evil remained able to damage that level since it was not yet fully and completely established so as to be able to rule and endure for ever. Nevertheless, we say that the evil was <i>outside</i> them in the sense of being outside of and separate from their mission. For now, the various levels that were sifted out and cleansed of the evil had a purpose opposite to that of evil, since now their mission was that of repair and not of destruction as it had been at first, when their function was rather to cause the destruction we spoke about above. However, since evil exists in the world – meaning that they are not immune to destruction, which, though not caused by themselves, may come upon them from elsewhere – we may therefore say that evil is outside them.
Thus the process of selection and cleansing that took place was such that as each individual level emerged from the destruction that had engulfed it, it became fixed as a law in the governmental order whose purpose was no longer to produce evil at all but on the contrary, to contribute to the repair now that evil and destruction already existed. And thus:
<b>...they would turn around to evade it.</b> For even though it had been in their nature to produce it, they were now intent on being repaired through the path of unity and leaving the previous mission behind. And this is the revelation of the perfection that I mentioned above, which constitutes the entire repair of the Sefirot. For since it is revealed gradually, the repair of the Sefirot likewise proceeds gradually. This means that they now returned to the path of unity in order to be repaired, but evil was not nullified. And the truth is that the reason evil was not entirely nullified is that not all the Sefirot were repaired completely in this way, for Malchut remained, as will be discussed below. Certainly, if all the Sefirot had been completely rectified, evil would have had no existence whatever.
You thus learn that the entire repair of the Sefirot is none other than the revelation of the perfection, when the levels change over to the path of unity, thereby departing from the mission of producing evil. Evil then exists only outside them, for it remains functional only on the level not yet repaired in this way, as the proposition goes on to state:
<b>Each level in turn then left the task of producing evil to the level below it.</b> Initially all the levels were intent on producing evil, and all of them were destroyed. We will now think of the entirety of all that was destroyed as one whole, with the levels coming forth out of this totality one by one. Now as each level emerged from the totality to be established as a law in the governmental order, its good purpose was determined. However, the evil purpose that had left it was not now negated. This is because the revelation of the perfection had come only to establish one governmental law and allow it to come forth from the evil, but not in order that evil should be nullified.
However, there is nothing that does not have a root, and if we say that evil was not nullified, where did it get the power to endure? The answer is that each level was initially engaged in the production of evil, and when the process of selection and cleansing took place, whatever departed from that purpose was picked out as a law in the governmental order. Even so, some root for evil remained because of that very level itself, for as yet the perfection was not completely revealed, except that this root was no longer considered to be at all related to the rectified level. For the latter is a single law established in the mode of repair, to which that part bears no relation, and therefore that root remains outside together with the rest of the overall totality which did not enter into the construction of the repaired level (i.e. the other levels, which had not as yet been cleansed. And since that root of evil remained, the evil – albeit limited – could, through sin, again become a part of that level.)
Afterwards, another level emerged beneath it and was repaired in the same way, leaving in place its root for the existence of evil and likewise the root left by the previous level, together with the totality of all that remained. However, when the second level came to be cleansed and sifted out of the overall totality, this totality included not only what had not yet been cleansed, in which all the evil was waiting to be rejected, but also what had been rejected from the first level. For the overall totality was like one grainpile from which a little more is taken each time while the rest is thrown aside until at the very end everything is sorted out.
Thus when Keter, for example, was selected and cleansed, it left a certain aspect of itself behind, for it no longer sustained the evil that had come from it with the exception of some aspect that still remained inasmuch as the perfection was still not revealed completely. However, this is not considered an aspect of Keter but rather an aspect of Chochmah, which had not yet been cleansed, and which still contained something that produced evil. And this is where the root of evil that had been in Keter went. Thus even the evil rejected from Keter was now being sustained through Chochmah, which came after it. Chochmah was then similarly cleansed, and the evil was rejected from it, yet the evil was still sustained, this time through Binah, which came after Chochmah. This included sustaining the evil that came from Keter as well as the evil that came from Chochmah.
And so it went on from level to level, until in the end, all the evil was left to the last level of Malchut of Asiyah, which sustained all the evil left by the higher Sefirot too. Malchut is itself a Sefirah which was also salvaged from the destruction, for if this were not so, Malchut would not exist. However, it was cleansed only a little, for on the contrary, it exists to maintain the Other Side for as long as necessary while still leaving it under the rule of holiness in accordance with the mystery contained in the verse, “And His kingship (Malchut) rules over all” (Psalms 103:19). However, since its task was still the maintenance of the Other Side, we say that it was not cleansed and purified like the others, as will be discussed further later on.
It could be objected that we have said two things that contradict each other. On the one hand we have made the comparison with a grainpile, from which a small portion is taken each time while the rest is thrown back. On the other hand, we have said that the maintenance of the evil of Keter is left to Chochmah and that of Chochmah to Binah, etc. But this is inconsistent with the metaphor of the grainpile, for the pile is an overall whole and cannot be considered a series of levels. This, indeed, makes more sense – for why does Chochmah have a stronger connection to the maintenance of the evil of Keter than the others?
The answer is that it is true that the maintenance of evil does indeed involve gradation – in the sense that evil itself initially had a great root, having also been rooted in Keter, but afterwards it descended one level, and was rooted only in Chochmah and below. Then afterwards it descended even further and was rooted only in Binah and below. This shows how the world is on the way to repair, since evil has some affinity only with the lower levels but not with the higher ones. Thus although in one aspect it appears as if the waste was “thrown back into the pile”, the truth is that the maintenance of evil passed immediately to Chochmah and all the more so to the levels below it. (That is to say, the task of maintaining evil fell to all that remained unpurified – in terms of the metaphor, it fell into the grainpile as a whole – except that it still relates to Chochmah and even more so to the levels below it.) However, when Chochmah was purified, it reached only Binah, and so it was in all cases until it remained on that bottom level which I mentioned.
<b>The upper level thus had a share in this...</b> For the Other Side certainly must contain levels corresponding to all the holy Sefirot. This parallelism came about through the fact that the evil corresponding to the good on each level was ejected, thereby bringing one level of the Other Side into being. If so, it must be that all the Sefirot have a share in it (in order that the Other Side will have the ability to rise up against all the Sefirot).
<b>...except that it was in the process of evading and being cleansed of it...</b> For this is the repair – to escape the evil that was emerging from it. <b>...and it was then fit to receive light.</b> For as explained above, first the vessels must be purified from their involvement in the production of evil, and then they can receive the light. Accordingly, as each level was sifted out and cleansed, so the light entered into it.
<b>The same happened on each successive level in relation to the level below it, until all the levels of Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah were cleansed, as they are now...</b> i.e. after Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah turned into Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah, as will be discussed below.
<b>...and they then left the task of producing evil to the lowest of all levels, that of Malchut of Asiyah. They were then all ready to receive the light except for this last level...</b> For the inner light is found in all the others, but not in this one. This was the intention of the ARI in writing that Malchut is called “robbed” or “despoiled” and must be rescued from the hands of the oppressor. (This means that the rejected waste of all the other levels remains in the Sefirah of Malchut, which has to maintain the Other Side, and in this sense the latter “oppresses” Malchut.) <b>...because the light can only spread in a vessel that is cleansed of evil.</b> This is the underlying reason for this entire process of cleansing, as explained above.
<b>Part 2: All this is called only the repair of the garments of Nekudim.</b> Even though we now have Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah (and it might appear that the garments are subsidiary to Atzilut), the truth is that all this is only Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah of Nekudim, and thus we speak in terms of the garments ruling until they were repaired. Their rule has still not come to an end, for their work will only be complete when all the processes of sifting and cleansing are complete.
<b>To the extent that the vessels were repaired, so the light would successively enter into them.</b> For the entire process of making Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah was a matter of cleansing the vessels. Whatever is cleansed more thoroughly becomes more elevated and receives a greater light. However, the complete great light has still not come as yet, this being the Atzliut that was concealed. For the garments themselves have not yet completed their repair, as it goes on to say later.
<b>The more remote the level of a given vessel from anything that has to do with evil, the greater the light it was fit to receive.</b> The gradation found in the respective distance from evil of the various levels derives from their gradation in terms of the maintenance of evil. (The ability of any given Sefirah to receive the light depends on its distance from the level of the lowest Sefirah, which is the one that maintains the evil.) For it is the lowest level of all that maintains evil. The level immediately above it, although not responsible for maintaining that evil, is nevertheless not far from it, while the next level above is still further away. The greatness of the lights in the vessels corresponds to the degree to which they have been cleansed.
<b>However, the first Atzilut was not revealed again...</b> It should be clear from everything I have written above that as long as the garments ruled in order to complete their construction, Atzilut had no affinity with this. <b>...for the repair of all these garments cannot be called complete as long as this lowest level is still directed to the production of evil...</b> Overall, the garments are still not rectified as long as one part continues to maintain the evil. Moreover, this causes a deficiency in all the other levels, because even the fact that the vessels remain distant from evil indicates that they still have some connection with it. (The vessels have a residual connection with evil in the sense that they may be nearer to or further away from it.) For this reason no part at all of (the first) Atzilut is now revealed, because the garment is not complete.
<b>...and thus devoid of the light.</b> This is the proof that this repair is not yet complete, for things are still the opposite of the ultimate intention. For we see that there is one level that is void of light, and it is surely necessary for all the levels to contain the light, for this is their perfection. This is the proof that so far things are still not complete.

Chapter 48

<i>The repair of Malchut by man, through which everything is completely repaired</i>
<b>The repair of this last level depends on the actions of men, whose task is to strengthen the power of holiness. Then evil will have no further purpose at all but everything will serve only the glory of the Creator. All the garments will then be said to have been repaired completely, and everything will return and serve to complete the first foundation that was established – that the entire creation should be of one accord, a single law of perfect repair revealing the unity of God, blessed be He. Atzilut of Nekudim, which is this first foundation, will then be revealed. The light will complete its entry into all the vessels, and the garments will be under the influence of Atzilut, and everything will be in a state of complete repair.</b>
<i>To complete this general overview of the subject of the Primordial Kings, it is also necessary to explain the purpose of this level that was left at the end.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The repair of this last level...</b> This explains how this level is repaired. <b>Part 2: Atzilut of Nekudim...</b> This explains what will come about through the repair of this level.
<b>Part 1: The repair of this last level depends on the actions of men...</b> For this is actually what the Supreme Mind prepared in order to provide for the possibility of reward and punishment. For God separated evil from the supernal Sefirot but left its complete removal in the hands of men, and this is what constitutes the repair of this level.
<b>...whose task is to strengthen the power of holiness.</b> There is no need for a new mission for mankind: it is enough that they themselves increase the power of the holy Sefirot through the power of their deeds. This indeed is the difference between the repair accomplished by the hand of Heaven and the repair accomplished by man, for everything that involved a new innovation had to be brought about by the hand of Heaven, but what simply involved reinforcing the repair and fixing it permanently was to be done by the hands of men.
<b>Then evil will have no further purpose at all...</b> For even this level only sustains evil in order that it should serve as a challenge during the time when this is necessary, and it is necessary only as long as flaws and sins remain. However, when all the souls have completed their mission, evil will have no further place because accusation will have no further relevance since it will no longer be proper to punish. (When there are no sins, there is no accusation and therefore nothing to nourish and sustain evil.) Moreover, it is man’s choice that gives control in the world either to the holy side or to the Other Side. The intent of the commandments is to put holiness in control and prevent the Other Side from taking control. Since men’s mission will then have been fulfilled and the service whereby they put holiness in total control and removed the power of evil will be complete, there will be no further place for evil. (Evil will be negated because there will be no need for it, since it was created to provide the possibility of repair through free will, and the repair will already be complete through the strengthening of good.)
<b>...but everything will serve only the glory of the Creator.</b> Even the evil that once existed returns to being for the glory of the Creator, as it goes on to say.
<b>All the garments will then be said to have been repaired completely...</b> This is the repair of the actual garments, in the sense that what had been evil in them will revert to good. This brings about the realization of the first law, that everything should be for the glory of Eyn Sof, blessed be He.
<b>...and everything will return and serve to complete the first foundation that was established – that the entire creation should be of one accord...</b> For the intent is to fulfill this overall purpose, as this is what came forth at the outset, and it still remains to be completed. For the purpose of all the different roundabout circuits was to complete the overall repair.
<b>...a single law of perfect repair...</b> This is the reason why everything comes back to this goal, but this is in truth the essence of the existence which the Supreme Mind brought forth, and this is what needs to come forth to operate in actuality, namely the law of the complete repair<b> ...revealing the unity of God, blessed be He.</b> For this was the ultimate goal of the plan from the outset – to reveal His supreme unity, which is complete perfection, in order that all that exists might delight in Him, as explained above.
<b>Part 2: Atzilut of Nekudim, which is this first foundation, will then be revealed.</b> For this Atzilut is none other than the emanation of the lights (their revelation and differentiation into all their details) on which the entire governmental order is based, in order that the souls may delight therein, as explained earlier. This must be in accordance with the perfect, rectified state. It is thus only after the garments are rectified and all the damage repaired that this Atzilut will be revealed. This is the emanation of the lights in accordance with the overall foundation of all that exists, which is that everything exists only for the glory of God, blessed be His name.
<b>The light will complete its entry into all the vessels...</b> For this Atzilut (or emanation of the lights) that we refer to applies to the vessels of the Nekudim. When the repair of the vessels is complete, the inner light will enter fully into the vessel (all the lights, including all the details of the revelation of the unity, will enter into the vessels) and the governmental order will thus be complete.
<b>...and the garments will be under the influence of Atzilut...</b> For as already explained, at present what were once the garments of Atzilut are in a state of having fallen to become worlds in themselves, since the body that was clothed in them is absent. But when the first Atzilut is again revealed, they will all go back to being its garments.
<b>...and everything will be in a state of complete repair.</b> For the lights will be complete, and the garments will be complete, fulfilling their proper function, and all that exists will be complete with no flaws.

Chapter 49

<i>The production of evil and its future return to good. Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah became Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah but will later revert into Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah.</i>
<b>That these vessels or garments should be the root of evil is not in itself an impairment, for on the contrary, this is the perfection of the creation according to the underlying intention – to reveal the supreme unity of God, blessed be He. However, at first they were the root of evil – which was actual evil. This evil must be turned back to good through the repairs carried out by men, and it will itself be to the glory of the King that men thereby attained merit.</b>
<b>In order to accomplish this in actuality, it was necessary for these garments to provide a place for it to come into being. This was through the selection and gradation that took place among them, until only the very last level of Malchut of Asiyah was left to produce it, and Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah turned into Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. And when it is rectified and turned back to good, things return to the way they were at first, and there is no longer any need for it to exist in actuality, for it is sufficient that it once existed and has now been rectified. This is the meaning of the verse, “He will consume death for ever” (Isaiah 25:8). And then Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah turn back into Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah, and the last part of Malchut of Asiyah becomes integrated with its whole, and the supreme Atzilut of the generality of the Nekudim is revealed. The garments will then remain as the root of the evil that once existed but was rectified and brought back to good. Eyn Sof, blessed be, He will then be said to have completed His works, and He alone will be exalted in His unity.</b>
<i>Having said that these worlds will go back to being subsidiary to Atzilut in the form of its “garments”, we must now complete our explanation of this matter and of how Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah turned into Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah and must finally return to being Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: That these vessels...</b> This explains what these garments were like before they produced evil and what they were like afterwards. <b>Part 2: In order to accomplish this in actuality...</b> This explains the process that took place in accordance with this basic principle.
<b>Part 1: That these vessels or garments should be the root of evil...</b> Clearly, since they produced evil when they ruled by themselves, they are certainly like this in their nature. Yet this <b>...is not in itself an impairment...</b> For if it were an impairment, the vessels would have to be nullified just like evil itself is nullified in the end. For just as the perfection that removes all deficiences removes evil itself, so to it would have to remove this impairment, which is a deficiency inasmuch as it is the cause of evil. But, as it goes onto explain, it is not an impairment, and therefore they will endure.
<b>...for on the contrary, this is the perfection of the creation according to the underlying intention – to reveal the supreme unity of God, blessed be He.</b> For the entire purpose was to demonstrate His true perfection by first showing exactly what the deficiencies are, so that through seeing their very power we may understand the nature of His true perfection, in that it removes these deficiencies. If there were to be nothing left in the very end to show what it was that had been deficient, what would have been gained from the entire existence of the world? The perfection would go back to what it was at first (had there been no evil) – His intrinsic perfection alone, for He is perfect – but this would not enable us to discern the real truth of this perfection as we should, through seeing its power to rectify the deficiencies. (The fact that the garments remain as the cause of evil is called a deficiency, but the fact that His perfection does not permit the evil to develop reveals the superiority of that perfection.)
<b>However, at first they were the root of evil – which was actual evil.</b> Certainly when this root of evil had to come into being in order to demonstrate God’s perfection, the initial purpose of its existence was to give existence to deficiencies through the concealment of that perfection. Afterwards, however, when the deficiencies are repaired, this root remains in order to show how that which was originally a deficiency has already been rectified. We will then see clearly the order and pathway whereby the deficiencies were rectified through the revelation of the perfection, which gradually, little by little, became continually more revealed, and likewise rectifies the deficiencies in the same gradual way.
All this can be seen and understood through this root. Initially it was the root of evil in the sense of actual evil. In other words, if evil carries out the evil incitement that is within its power, this is called actual evil. But when it is evil in its intrinsic nature yet it contains within it that which rectifies it – in the sense that it can no longer do evil – this is called evil that has reverted to good, because it has literally changed its function. Initially it was actual evil inasmuch as its own intrinsic nature was such that wherever it was found, it obstructed the flow of blessing and sustenance. However, when it reverts to good, it greatly increases the flow of sustenance and blessing in the place where it is found, and the flow of sustenance is in proportion to the intensity of the original evil. (The revelation of His unity is all the greater and the stature of those who choose good is enhanced.)
This is rightly so: the very evil that was so strong in its nature yet was nevertheless overcome by man is itself man’s own witness to argue in his favor and show his merit. The stronger the evil, the greater the merit that is revealed through the power of the person who overcame it. The same applies in the case of the overall perfection. As long as evil is still not repaired, it is, as it were, a stain on the honor of the King. However, after evil is brought under control through the supreme unity, which rectifies the damage, evil itself turns back to show the glory of the King, as if to say: “See how such great evil is powerless to do anything because of the perfection of the One Master”. Thus the evil itself returns to good and the flow of blessing is greatly increased, because the essential flow of blessing is that which comes from the revelation of God’s unity, for this is the delight of the souls, as explained above.
These two aspects that we have mentioned – the revelation of the glory of the King and man’s merit – are interconnected. For man’s whole task is to reveal this unity, and when it is revealed, this is through the strong faith of the people of Israel, who believe in His unity and take courage in it even in the face of the worst troubles. Indeed, the entire practice of the commandments is bound up with the mystery of the revelation of the unity that started with the repair of the vessels, as discussed above. (The Holy One, blessed be He, started with the purification of the vessels, and man completes the process through carrying out the commandments. Then God can shine to the vessels, and this is the revelation of His unity.)
Evil thus has two functions. The first is at the start of its existence, when it produces every kind of deficiency and is, as it were, a stain on the glory of the King. Wherever it exists, it reduces the flow of blessing, and then it is called actual evil. The second function is after it already exists, when unity has already taken control over it and the evil no longer acts but rather it is the unity that functions in its perfection. Evil itself then shows the glory of the great unity of the King, as if to say, “This is what the King overcame through His great perfection”. Wherever the evil was greater, the flow of blessing is now greater, all according to the work and effort involved. Man’s merit is then in direct proportion to the greatness of the evil rectified through his efforts.
<b>This evil must be turned back to good...</b> i.e. so as to serve a good purpose, as explained above. In other words, it must be the rectified deficiency itself that brings about a more powerful revelation of God’s perfection. Indeed, the stronger the evil becomes, it simply indicates that a greater perfection wants to be revealed. This is obvious. For the meaning of perfection is that it has the power to rectify the deficiencies. Thus the perfection is all the greater when it rectifies a greater deficiency. If so, when the Supreme Will wanted to reveal His very great perfection, it was first necessary to reveal a very great deficiency. This itself is part of the revelation of the perfection itself, for it is impossible to understand the perfection without the preceding deficiency, which the perfection rectifies. If so, when He wants to reveal His perfect, most glorious power, wherein the souls have the greatest delight, a very great deficiency must first be revealed. For according to the deficiency that is revealed, so is the level of the perfection that is revealed at the end, and through a greater deficiency, a more perfect power is revealed.
You cannot say it would have been better had there been no deficiency and if the good destined to reign in the end had existed from the beginning. This is not so, for perfection does not only mean good, it means the repair of deficiency. Thus if there had been no deficiency, the perfection would not have been revealed but only the good. However, the true delight of the souls is not in good but in perfection (for only when the deficiency is overcome can they rise to new levels of attainment), and this perfection is His unity, as explained above (see Opening 4).
<b>...through the repairs carried out by men...</b> For the Supreme Will made the revelation of His unity contingent on the repairs carried out by men, so that they should be the ones who finally reveal it. It is they who (through their performance of the commandments and through their faith) are to bring about the desire of the supreme unity to be revealed in actuality and to rule, showing that it is in His power to make evil turn back to good in the end. Not only do they receive a fitting reward for their deeds – this is the good that is revealed – but they even receive a reward for their effort. This is that they can enjoy the good without feeling any shame.
We thus see that evil itself reverts to good, for it is evil that brings about this extra repair (through necessitating the extra effort). The supreme perfection then becomes known in the process, since this is what repairs all these deficiencies, these being the punishments of the wicked. (In time to come it will be revealed how the punishment served only the purpose of repair, and if so the unity will be revealed even through the judgment of the wicked.) For evil itself exists only because of His desire to conceal Himself, and if they fail to improve their behavior, they have to endure suffering. (This shows that evil brings no benefit but only troubles.) More than that, at the end of everything, the unity is revealed and evil itself reverts to good, for the unity is revealed and the deficiencies are rectified.
<b>...and it will itself be to the glory of the King that men thereby attained merit.</b> The fact that the revelation of the unity is contingent on men’s deeds contains another repair for evil itself. This is that even its existence in the category of actual evil is itself for the glory of the King, for this is what makes it possible for men to attain merit, since they were forced to work and make repairs in order to reveal the supreme unity. If there had been no actual evil, they would not have had any merit. Therefore, through the repairs carried out by man, the deficiencies themselves are repaired through the revelation of the unity and perfection. (For it is thereby revealed that the deficiencies were brought about for a good purpose – to give men a reward.) Then even its previous existence in the category of actual evil turns out to have been good.
<b>Part 2: In order to accomplish this in actuality, it was necessary for these garments to provide a place for it to come into being.</b> As explained above, the Supreme Will wanted the individual details of the process to be distinct – the deficiencies by themselves and the repair by itself.
<b>This was through the selection and gradation that took place among them...</b> For initially, even though the vessels were broken, as stated above, everything was only in the Sefirot prior to the emergence of separate creations. Thus when we say that evil was revealed, this was not actual evil itself – the Other Side – but rather, the <i>roots</i> of evil, i.e. the strict judgments and flaws of all different kinds found in the lights themselves. Actual evil itself emerged only afterwards, following the repair – in other words, after all the levels were instituted in their repaired state as laws in the governmental order. It was then that they brought forth the separate creations and the Other Side emerged in accordance with these roots revealed when the vessels broke. It was the breaking of the vessels that involved the separation into levels that we discussed above (Opening 47), where each level in succession turned away from producing evil, leaving only the lowest level of Malchut of Asiyah to produce evil. It was this lowest level of Malchut of Asiyah that brought forth evil into actuality, with aspects corresponding to all the roots contained in it from all the Sefirot. For this Malchut includes all those roots and brings forth their function into actuality in the form of the Other Side itself.
In order to accomplish this, a major gradation into different levels was necessary in the fallen garments, and out of three they became four. Thus Malchut of Asiyah as it is now is only one part of the original Malchut of Asiyah, for the other parts rose higher and did not remain on the same low level. What this means is that since all the other levels were intent on separating themselves from the production of evil, they left only this level of Malchut of Asiyah to carry out this function, while all the other parts separated from it. They also all separated one from another (for example, part of Yetzirah rose to Beriyah, and so on), until Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah turned into Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah.
The task of producing evil was thus left to the very last of all these levels, which, being only a part of what should have been Malchut of Asiyah, was no longer of great stature. And when the production of evil is no longer necessary, this level will go back to being included with the other levels that separated from it, and all of them together will make up Malchut of Asiyah instead of only this lowest part. Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah will go back to being only Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah, and the supreme Atzilut will be revealed over them as it was before the breaking of the vessels. (“In time to come... the name of SaG will return to its original status, while the name of MaH will not operate” – <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar HaTikkun</i> ch. 3, p. 49b.)
<b>...until only the very last level of Malchut of Asiyah was left to produce it...</b> For the different levels are actually powers that spread forth one after the other, each power less than the one before. For the concealment is more intense in the second than in the first (since the second is closer to Malchut, which produces evil). And although “two hundred includes one hundred” and the lower level is included in the upper, the mission of the lower level is nevertheless not revealed there as long as the upper level functions and the concealment has not yet reached the necessary degree of intensity to produce the lower level. Thus as long as the lower level was included as part of the upper level, its offspring did not emerge.
Since the intention was to bring forth evil, the upper levels were in the process of separating from the lower levels, where there was a corresponding increase in the degree of concealment. This was precisely what distinguished them from the upper levels, because the concealment on the lower levels was so intense that evil could emerge from them, which was not the case on the earlier levels.
The explanation of all this is bound up with the idea discussed earlier that everything which acquires its own independent function acquires its own name. Accordingly, this lowest level should not have been a separate aspect in itself but should rather have been subordinate to the function of the other parts which departed from it, and then its mission would have been like theirs. Instead of producing evil, it would have served to complete the earlier levels. But clearly, the reason why we call this lowest level a level on its own is that the light found there is on a level lower than that of the previous level, even though initially the lower level also came into the overall category of the first. This is the gradation that we say took place here.
<b>...and Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah turned into Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah.</b> For this did not take place on only one level. Much gradation was necessary in order to reach the point where they became four: Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. For this Asiyah is very lowly – so much so that it was Malchut of Asiyah, its lowest level, that produced evil.
<b>And when it is rectified and turned back to good, things return to the way they were at first...</b> For you have already heard how evil exists in two states. The first is when it is actual evil – carrying out the evil in its power. The second state is when these very functions of evil will have sunk down in their place and will not operate. Evil is then said to have reverted to good, as stated above. Evil will no longer function because of the perfection that will be revealed, and the return of evil to good brings a flow of great blessing. The final state of repair will be when evil no longer exists in the state in which it performs evil. Aspects of evil will exist only in the sense of being negated: they will not function because of the revelation of the unity, which prevents them from functioning.
There is nothing that does not have a root, and every separate function must have a separate root. As discussed earlier, the garments are the levels in which the various aspects of evil are rooted, but while these garments contain the potential for evil to exist, the evil aspects do not exist in them in actuality. The outcome is in the balance. If the garments rule alone without being subordinate to Atzilut, this shows that the concealment is intensifying, and the concealment may become so intense that they produce actual evil. But as long as they are subordinate to Atzilut, this shows that the unity is still revealed and in control, and then the concealment does not intensify to the point that they produce actual evil.
As mentioned above, the root of the existence of evil in the sense of actual evil lies in the lowest level of Malchut of Asiyah. Thus when the Supreme Mind wanted to produce evil, this was done by hiding Atzilut from the garments. They then ruled independently, and the concealment intensified to the point where that lowly power emerged and evil came forth – actual evil. And when the unity is once again revealed and asserts itself to rectify the damage, the state in which evil actively produces evil has to be negated. Accordingly, the particular power that produced it in actuality no longer needs to exist, and the concealment that brought it forth disappears. Rather, the garments exist in the same way as they did in the beginning, where evil has the potential to be actual evil, except that it does not come forth because of the unity that has returned and consumed it, and which no longer allows it to exist in the state of actual evil. This necessarily shows the functioning of the unity. (The unity is revealed only after the emergence of actual evil. Evil has the power to spread, and is prevented only through the revelation of the unity. Thus evil continues to exist in its sunken state in order to show the power of the unity.)
<b>...and there is no longer any need for it to exist in actuality...</b> Evil as such – actual evil – is not seen in the garments as something capable of action. On the contrary, it does not exist because of the unity. <b>...for it is sufficient that it once existed and has now been rectified.</b> Initially it had to come out, because we did not yet know what it was and thus did not understand the true power of perfection. But now that it has already existed and has been rectified, it is sufficient that it should be seen to be the same evil that once existed and could still exist were it not for the unity. This shows that it is the unity that brings about the repair and does not permit evil.
<b>This is the meaning of the verse, “He will consume death for ever” (Isaiah 25:8).</b> This is exactly what we are saying, that the evil becomes absorbed in its root. <b>And then Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah turn back into Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah...</b> In other words, with the return of the state of repair in the future, the Nekudim will have to revert to what they were before the breaking of the vessels. This is obvious, because what happened when the vessels broke is that they fell to Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, which afterwards became Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. They were thus missing the true Atzilut, this being what existed before the vessels broke. And this is what will be revealed in the future. If so, these worlds must all revert to being Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah in relation to the true Atzilut that will then be revealed.
<b>...and the last part of Malchut of Asiyah becomes integrated with its whole...</b> For this part of Malchut is only one part of the original Malchut, from which this lowly Malchut emerged after the departure of the first Atzilut. In the future, this last part of Malchut will be included in the overall Malchut from which it emerged.
The distinguishing feature of all that happens in the time of the repair is that it comes to rectify everything that was damaged at the time of the breaking of the vessels. The damage caused by the breaking of the vessels was as follows. Firstly, the original Atzilut became concealed. Secondly, the garments fell and descended until Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah turned into Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. This resulted in the last part of Malchut of Asiyah being left to produce evil in the category of actual evil. Thirdly, all the garments remained flawed because of their role in the production of evil. Even though the upper levels separated themselves from this function, they were not completely dissociated from it as long as their final level was still involved in it.
Correspondingly, in the complete repair, the existence of evil in the sense of actual evil is nullified. (Evil no longer functions as such but remains only in order to reveal the unity.) So too, the part of Malchut that produced actual evil is “consumed” and absorbed by the upper parts. This automatically negates the gradation whereby Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah became Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah, for this was brought about for the sole purpose of producing evil. Once Malchut is no longer producing evil, Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah revert to being only Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah, while the Atzilut that was concealed is now revealed over them. They then remain as garments that are without flaws. At first they were the root of evil, and the unity was concealed from them to the point that they produced the evil rooted in them as actual evil. Now, however, the powers that previously brought forth evil no longer do so because of the unity that is already revealed, which turns evil back to good, so that evil no longer has any existence in the sense of actual evil.
<b>...and the supreme Atzilut of the generality of the Nekudim is revealed...</b> For now that only the worlds of Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah are left, Atzilut comes to complete them, for this itself is the repair: the reason why they were subsumed to become Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah is precisely in order to accept this Atzilut over them.
<b>The garments will then remain as the root of the evil that once existed but was rectified and brought back to good.</b> For their initial purpose was to produce evil through the concealment of the unity. Now, however, they serve as powers that <i>could</i> produce evil were it not for the unity, but which can no longer produce it in actuality precisely because of the unity. This way they truly reveal the unity, for the entire process is seen there just as it is: evil existed when the powers inherent in the garments spread, but now it no longer exists because of the unity that is revealed over them.
<b>Eyn Sof, blessed be He, will then be said to have completed His works...</b> This is the whole cycle, for this entire cycle was required in order to reveal the unity, and when it is completed, all the work that had to be done is complete. From then on the unity will already have been revealed, and all subsequent ascents will be in accordance with the unity already revealed and will therefore follow a different path. This is the mystery of the rest (מנוחה, <i>menuchah</i>) enjoyed by the world in the seventh millennium. The whole process from the beginning of the concealment until the revelation of the unity takes place for the entire duration of the first six millennia. This whole process was precisely what was needed in order to demonstrate clearly the truth of what was known already.
It was already known in the beginning that God’s unity is the underlying truth (for “before the creation of the world, He was one and His name was one” – <i>Zohar Chadash</i>, <i>Bereishit</i> 10, <i>Pirkey d’Rabbi Eliezer</i> ch. 3). However, the Eyn Sof wanted to reveal this unity with total clarity in order to demonstrate the greatness of His perfection. To do so, He had to produce a great work – the concealment of this very perfection to the point that deficiencies would come into being, until in the very end it would again be revealed. This way, what existed from the very beginning is finally visible. It can then be said that He will be at rest from this work, having completed what He thought to do, and this primordial unity will then be revealed. From then on there will be eternal delight – this is the delight of the souls in the demonstration of the truth. This is the true delight, as explained earlier (Opening 4). The revelation of His unity will raise man to ever greater heights, as planned in His hidden thought.
As you can see, there is a difference between the six thousand years and what comes afterwards. The entire six thousand years are one continuous cycle that revolves until it reaches the point from which it departed, namely the unity, for it was from there that the cycle traveled and that is where it will return, and then it will rest. This is the rest of the life eternal. What will be from then on is something different and follows a path quite unlike the present path (whereby the revelation of the unity comes about through man’s service).
The coming of Mashiach is the beginning of the revelation of the unity. This is the mystery contained in the verse, “Make us glad according to the days wherein You have afflicted us” (Psalms 90:15). For the days of Mashiach are parallel to all the deficiencies which existed in the past (not in terms of the duration of the concealment, but in the sense that the revelation of the unity will be in proportion to the intensity of the previous concealment). In that time until the end of the sixth millennium, the unity must reveal its power on every side, and all the deficiencies will thereby be rectified. At the end of the sixth millennium, after the great Day of Judgment, when everything that was done will be seen clearly in its true light, the unity will be said to have been revealed again. This work will then be complete and the cycle will come to rest. From then on, deeper interior aspects will become visible, these being the very roots of this process. These are things that are revealed after the unity has come to be known. They are the deepest roots of the order of government, which are presently completely beyond our grasp.
In the seventh millennium itself the very root of what existed in this world throughout the period of the cycle will be revealed. The six millennia thus constitute the mystery of the world of Nekudim, while their complete rectification in the seventh millennium constitutes the mystery of the world of Akudim. The latter also contains a vessel, except that it is entirely subject to the soul, as explained in its appropriate place. As you have already heard, what was done in Akudim is the root of what was to happen afterwards in the world of Nekudim. However, in Akudim the unity was revealed in everything so that there was no place for any breaking of vessels or anything else of what was to occur afterwards (after the creation of evil as a consequence of the breaking of the vessels). Accordingly, after the unity is revealed, it will be known what was prepared in the supreme order of government, even with the revelation of the unity, to lead to this matter. For the vessel was already revealed there, as stated above, and preparations were laid down there for what is to be later.
Afterwards the world will be renewed in a different way, unrelated to these aspects bound up with Akudim (which is the world of the Mouth). From then on (above the Mouth, from the eighth millennium onwards) the levels of attainment will be entirely different, bringing amazing delight to the souls that gain such a revelation of the supreme perfection – and this must suffice for now.<br> (“In the seventh millennium, the bodies will rise to the level of the Akudim, where the body is subject to the soul... but the body is still discernible. However, in the eighth millennium, the body will be merged with the soul as at first, as in the lights of the Nose. In the ninth millennium, it will be merged with the soul as in the lights of the Ear, yet the body is still somewhat discernible. In the tenth, it will return to the level of the World to Come, which cannot be understood in any way” – <i>Ramchal, Pitchey Chochmah VaDaat</i> p. 48.)
<b>...and He alone will be exalted in His unity.</b> This is the mystery of the verse, “And God will be exalted alone on that day” (Isaiah 2:11). This implies that until then He does not wish to act as the unitary Master but rather like a mighty hero who possesses great power, as explained above (Opening 30). This gave a place for the Other Side to presume to challenge and fight against this power. Afterwards things go differently when the Eyn Sof, blessed be He, acts in the unity of His power like the unitary Master, literally and actually. Then things like the accusations of the Other Side and the destruction caused by evil have no further relevance. God alone acts with His power and will. This is complete good, and everything is thus in its proper state of repair, wholeness and perfection.

Chapter 50

<i>The entry of the light into the vessels and its exit are the root of the governmental order of this world in a state of damage and repair.</i>
<b>Nothing is in vain. Therefore the initial entry of the light and its subsequent turnabout and departure – when all this gradation could have been brought about from the outset without this – also has an essential function and consequence. And this is the individual root needed to give existence to the governmental order of this world in its various states of damage and repair, reward and punishment, according to the complete measure of what is required for this, neither less nor more.</b>
<i>Having provided an overall conspectus of the subject of the Primordial Kings, it is now necessary to go back and explain the initial stages accordingly.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: Nothing is in vain.</b> This explains how the lights entered into the vessels and afterwards turned back and went out. <b>Part 2: And this is the individual root...</b> This explains the reason for this phenomenon.
<b>Part 1: Nothing is in vain.</b> This is obvious from two sides. Firstly, that anything could be for no purpose is quite inconceivable in the Supreme Mind, for something that is without a purpose is quite unfitting and it is impossible that anything unfitting could exist in the Supreme Mind. Secondly, as we have already said, the Sefirot are the measures of all the creations in all their different parts and aspects as laid down in the Supreme Mind, and the Sefirot are nothing except this. If so, the Sefirot contain nothing that does not exist in the creations, and accordingly nothing is in vain.
<b>Therefore the initial entry of the light and its subsequent turnabout and departure... </b>Even when we do not know what results from a given phenomenon, on the strength of the above unshakeable premise we certainly know that it has some consequence, except that we have not understood it. Moreover, on the basis of that premise we can legitimately infer that the phenomenon in question is also necessary in order to produce a result of precisely the required nature.
To apply this to the subject under discussion: Since we see that the lights entered into the vessels and then turned back and went out, we infer that this must have happened for a reason. However, the reason cannot have been simply to produce the gradation (of the Partzufim) since that could have been brought about without this. We must therefore say that it was for some other reason. But since we see that this phenomenon comes to produce the gradation – for it is through this that it came about – we can therefore immediately infer that although the gradation could have been produced without this phenomenon, it must have required some condition that would not have been fulfilled had it not been produced in this way, as it goes on to say.
<b>...when all this gradation could have been brought about from the outset without this...</b> For the light did not do anything – it did not act. It simply did not join with the vessel, because the vessel was not complete, and the light waited until the gradation on which the repair of the vessel depended was brought about. If so, the light itself did not do anything in producing the gradation, it just waited until the gradation was brought about. If so, why did it enter initially?
<b>…also has an essential function... </b>For certainly the entry of the light into the vessels produces some effect in those vessels.<b> ...and consequence.</b> Everything that was done above has a conseqence in the governmental order of the worlds.
<b>Part 2: And this is the individual root...</b> i.e. the root of the specific nature of the creations lies in the combination of the lights above. Where the lights above shine in a revealed way, this puts greater power into the creations. Lights shining above in a revealed way put greater power into the creations. Concealment causes weakness. The number of lights above correspond to all the different aspects required in what exists. Where some aspect of existence needs to be weak, the light that is its root has to be closed up or occluded. What has to be strong requires that its light should be open. There is thus a combination of just so many revelations and just so many occlusions in those places, i.e. those individual lights which are responsible for producing the particular design and character of what exists below in all its aspects.
<b>...needed to give existence to the governmental order of this world...</b> For this is the result that derives from this root through this particular combination.
<b>...in its various states of damage and repair...</b> What we see here are the roots of damage and repair, with things sometimes going in one direction, sometimes in another. This is because in our world damage and repair have been combined to exist in various different ways, and all these corresponding roots can therefore be discerned above. <b>...reward and punishment...</b> For this is the main thing that comes out of this.
<b>...according to the complete measure of what is required for this, neither less nor more.</b> The Supreme Mind knew how to calculate what had to exist in order to bring all this about to perfection, and decreed accordingly how many roots of damage should exist and how many roots of repair and in which order and manner they should be subject to one another.

Chapter 51

<big><strong>States of the First Three Sefirot of Nekudim (Openings 51-53)</strong></big>
<i>The root of the creations is in the seven lower Sefirot, while the first three only direct them. When the vessels broke, the first three Sefirot did not break, but were flawed through their connection with the lower seven.</i>
<b>The root of the created worlds and beings lies only in the seven lower Sefirot, which are the Seven Days of Creation, while the first three Sefirot are only crowns over the lower seven, to direct and repair them. Accordingly damage is not applicable to the three first Sefirot in their intrinsic essence, since they are above the level affected by men’s deeds. Thus sins do not damage them, but rather, they drive them away. Accordingly, the first three Sefirot endured. Nevertheless, even in their case, what exists in them to serve the needs of the lower seven was not repaired, for if it had been repaired, all of the seven lower Sefirot would also have been rectified. Accordingly even in the first three Sefirot, those aspects that relate to the seven lower Sefirot became flawed. This prevented the proper spread of their power to repair the seven lower Sefirot. For if it were constantly spreading, there would be no damage in the world.</b>
<i>On the basis of our overall conspectus of the breaking of the vessels, which took place for the sake of the governmental order, we will now explain the process in detail.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The root of the created...</b> This explains what was already rectified in these Sefirot. <b>Part 2: Nevertheless, even in their case...</b> This explains what still remained unrectified.
<b>Part 1: The root of the created worlds and beings lies only in the seven lower Sefirot...</b> This is something accepted by all the Kabbalistic sages, who called these the seven Sefirot of building (בנין, <i>binyan</i>, or the “constructive” Sefirot), and thus it says “The world is <i>built</i> on Kindness (חסד, <i>chessed</i>)” (Psalms 89:3), Chessed being the first in the building.
<b>...which are the Seven Days of Creation...</b> This is clear proof – for everything that was created is surely included in these seven days alone. Even according to the self-evident, simple meaning of the Bible, if everything came about in these seven days, it means that these seven days are sufficient to serve as the root. All the more so when we already know that kabbalistically, the seven days constitute the actual rule of the seven Sefirot, in that each one functions according to its power on that day. (See Ramban, Commentary on the Torah, Genesis 1:3.) Since everything came forth in the Seven Days of Creation, it must certainly be the case that everything came out of these Sefirot.
<b>...while the first three Sefirot are only crowns over the lower seven...</b> Everything that stands outside a thing’s essential being – in the sense that the thing’s essential being is complete without it – can only be an extra crown adorning it but not an integral part of it. So it is in the case of the first three Sefirot, which are not the actual root of what goes on in this world but rather, they are crowns over that root. This is properly so, because everything that happens in the world must certainly have a root of its own just to keep it in existence. It is not the basic existence of things in this world but rather their status that has to change depending on men’s deeds. Accordingly, two roots are needed here: a root for the unchanging existence of things and a root for their changing status.
This is the reason for the institution of the seven lower and three upper Sefirot. The seven lower Sefirot are the root of the created realms and beings in their essential existence, which is unchanging. And it is the seven lower Sefirot that produce the different aspects of the creation. From Chessed there is a constant flow of water and from Gevurah fire, while Yesod is always the source of the structure. From Chessed comes wisdom, from Gevurah wealth, from Tiferet life, and so on. However, any increase or decrease in degree or status in all these aspects depends upon the three first Sefirot. When they shine strongly in the seven lower Sefirot, the latter will bring forth superior offspring in a state of greater repair. But if they shine in only a limited way, the offspring of the seven lower Sefirot will be lowly and lacking in repair. Thus the seven lower Sefirot are the root of the created realms and beings while the three first Sefirot are crowns over them.
<b>...to direct them...</b> I have explained elsewhere how the seven lower Sefirot are governed in all aspects through the first three Sefirot (see <i>Klaley Kin’at HaShem Tzeva’ot</i> #11, <i>Daat Tevunot</i> p. 332ff). If so, the first three also contain Kindness, Judgment and Mercy in order to complete the governmental order and allow each part to rule as needed (and thus the upper three Sefirot correspond to Kindness, Judgment and Mercy).
<b>...and repair them.</b> For when they shine over the seven lower Sefirot, this immediately brings them to a greater state of repair and gives them greater status purely by virtue of the fact that they come under their influence. However, if the three upper Sefirot leave, the many flaws rooted in the intrinsic nature of the lower seven function by default. (But when they are under the influence of the upper three, their intrinsic flaws become inoperative.)
<b>Accordingly damage is not applicable to the three first Sefirot in their intrinsic essence...</b> For man’s deeds have no influence for better or for worse except on those levels in which he is rooted: any flaw reaches only the seven lower Sefirot.
<b>...since they are above the level affected by men’s deeds.</b> For men’s deeds affect only the various aspects of the world made to serve his needs and all their roots.
<b>Thus sins do not damage them...</b> This is entirely consistent with their purpose. We have already explained that they are crowns over the governmental order, which send their influence over the seven lower Sefirot and bring about their repair. Thus they contain aspects to which men’s deeds are relevant and aspects to which they are not. Men’s deeds have no bearing on their intrinsic existence, whereas the spread of their influence is subject to men’s deeds inasmuch as this reaches the seven lower Sefirot and affects their repair. Thus sins cannot damage them or cause darkness in them in the same way as they can in the case of the lower seven, where they cause deficiencies when the influence of the upper three is lacking, leaving darkness in its place.
<b>...but rather, they drive them away.</b> This is a flaw in the lower seven, and this is the darkness mentioned above, which develops in the seven lower Sefirot when the flow of blessing is lacking.
<b>Accordingly, the three first Sefirot endured.</b> For since destruction is not applicable in their case, it was therefore unnecessary for any breakage to occur in them, for the only purpose of the breaking of the vessels was to make a place for destruction, and here destruction is of no relevance.
<b>Part 2: Nevertheless, even in their case, what exists in them to serve the needs of the lower seven was not repaired...</b> For each thing has its own repairs and arrangements to ensure that they function properly. Thus the spread of influence from the upper three Sefirot to the lower seven requires arrangements to enable it to emerge in the proper way, neither less nor more than necessary. This is the aspect that was not repaired in the upper three Sefirot.
<b>...for if it had been repaired, all of the seven lower Sefirot would also have been rectified.</b> We are discussing the aspect whereby the three upper Sefirot rectify the lower seven. This is what we say was lacking in them. Obviously, if it had been present – i.e. if they had been able to repair the lower seven – the latter would have been repaired, whereas it was necessary that the seven lower Sefirot should not be repaired by the first three (since the breaking of the vessels was a necessity). If so, it must be that the repair of the seven lower Sefirot depends on the first three – i.e. among their various aspects is the aspect whereby they repair them, and it is this aspect of being able to rectify the seven lower Sefirot that was lacking from the first three.
<b>Accordingly even in the first three Sefirot, those aspects that relate to the seven lower Sefirot became flawed.</b> These aspects are their “back parts” (אחוריים, <i>achorayim</i>), which are those that relate to the seven lower Sefirot. (These are their Netzach-Hod-Yesod, which pass the influence of the higher level to the lower.) This also applies to the “back parts” of Netzach-Hod-Yesod of Keter, which channel Kindnesses and Severities to Abba and Imma, as explained elsewhere. (See <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Shevirat HaKelim</i> ch. 2; <i>Pitchey Chochmah VaDaat</i> #43, <i>Shaarey Ramchal</i> p. 184.)
<b>This prevented the proper spread...</b> We have already said that the breaking of the vessels was the root of all the damage. And since it was necessary for the Sefirot to be made in such a way that they could be flawed – i.e. darkened – they were made to fragment, which was the preparation for this flaw. Likewise the break-up of the “back parts” of Abba and Imma was a preparation for the state of damage. However, there can be no damage in Abba and Imma themselves. Rather, the damage is in the same aspect in which the breaking of the vessels took place, i.e. that which relates to the seven lower Sefirot. Accordingly, the damage is in what relates to the seven lower Sefirot – i.e. that the power of Abba and Imma does not continually spread into the seven lower Sefirot in order to repair them.
<b>...of their power to repair the seven lower Sefirot.</b> In any event some power must emerge from the upper three Sefirot to the lower seven. The flaw was that the power could not flow properly but was highly reduced. This is the mystery of the mentality of immaturity (מוחין דקטנות, <i>mochin dekatnut</i>), as will be explained in the appropriate place.
<b>For if it were constantly spreading, there would be no damage in the world.</b> Thus the reason is similar to the reason we stated above. They lacked what relates to the seven lower Sefirot, because it was necessary for the breaking of the vessels to occur in the seven lower Sefirot, and this itself is the reason for the necessary flaw in the first three – so that there could be a flaw in the seven lower Sefirot. For without it, there would have been no flaw in them.

Chapter 52

<i>The intrinsic essence of Zeir Anpin (of the Primordial Kings) is stern judgment – divisiveness and limitation – out of which comes the Other Side. Zeir Anpin is rectified and sweetened by Imma through the arousal of the Nukva.</i>
<b>The root of Zeir Anpin’s essential nature lies in Imma’s stern judgments – her five mighty powers. In accordance with this essential nature, each light stands by itself and does not join with any other. This is because the nature of Judgment is not to display brotherly love. Rather, all is dejection and angry faces. However, Imma overcomes this with her sweetening power. As the stern Judgment subsides, so the dejection passes and brotherly love reigns. It is for this purpose that Imma enters into Zeir Anpin and makes brotherly love reign among his Sefirot. This is done through Malchut, for Malchut was instituted as the container vessel for all of them, so that instead of each light shining separately, they are all directed to one single place. A connection then develops between them, and they all turn to Malchut as the “hind of love” (Proverbs 5:19), and they themselves join with one another. The more they turn to her, the stronger the bond of brotherly love between them, and this brings great joy.</b>
<b>This is what was lacking in the Primordial Kings, for the Six Directions were not turned towards Malchut and therefore did not escape the sadness and angry faces, and Imma still allowed them to remain that way. Accordingly, the first three Sefirot of Zeir Anpin were missing, for these result from Imma’s entry into and repair of Zeir Anpin. The others were then termed the domain of the many (</b>רשות הרבים<b>, <i>reshut harabim</i>), and this was the state from which the Other Side emerged, which is why its nature and function are only to cause separation.</b>
<i>Having discussed the three first Sefirot, we must now discuss the lower seven.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The root of Zeir Anpin’s essential nature...</b> This introduces the idea of how the Sefirot connect and bond together. <b>Part 2: This is what was lacking...</b> This explains how this applies in the case of the Primordial Kings.
<b>Part 1: The root of Zeir Anpin’s essential nature lies in Imma’s stern judgments (דינים, <i>dinim</i>)...</b> The function of Zeir Anpin is to govern according to strict Judgment, as brought out by the comment in the <i>Zohar</i> on the verse, “HaShem, He is God” (Kings I, 18:39): “‘HaShem’ (YKVK=Kindness) applies to Atik (=Arich Anpin); ‘God’ (אלקים, Elokim=Judgment) applies to Zeir Anpin” (<i>Idra Rabba</i>, <i>Naso</i> 138b). For Arich Anpin is the rule of Chessed and every aspect of mitigation – mitigating all the stern judgments wherever they may be. But the function of Zeir Anpin is the opposite. Its root lies in stern judgment, except that the powers of mitigation hold sway over it. However, these powers of mitigation can depart from Zeir Anpin, leaving the stern judgment in its full force, which can cause total devastation. This is not so in the case of Arich Anpin, which is intrinsically inclined to Kindness and does not require mitigation by others, with the result that it is always on the side of Kindness.
Now the root of the stern judgments lies above, but it is not clearly discernible there because Kindness holds sway above. However, when it reaches Yesod of Imma, it comes to a level where it can be revealed, producing there the five “mighty powers” (גבורות, <i>gevurot</i>) according to the mystery whereby “stern judgments are stirred up through her (i.e. Imma)” (<i>Zohar</i>,<i> Vayikra</i> 65a). The wording is precise: the stern judgments “are stirred up through her”. For Imma is not intrinsically an aspect of Judgment, yet the attribute of Judgment <i>derives</i> from Imma.<br> Thus the five mighty powers in Yesod of Imma already enter the category of revealed Judgment, and from there stems the root of Zeir Anpin, which constitutes the governmental order of Justice (משפט, <i>mishpat</i>), as will be discussed below. Its essence is first and foremost strict Judgment, but at certain times the power of mitigation gains strength and holds sway over it. This is the underlying secret of the saying of the sages that, “Everything came from the earth (עפר, <i>aphar</i>), including even the sphere of the sun” (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Tzav</i> 34b; <i>Midrash Rabbah Bereishit</i> 12:11). The “sun” is an allusion to Zeir Anpin, while the “earth” refers to the five mighty powers, which had already reached this level (in Yesod of Imma) of being actual powers of severity. Out of this was built Zeir Anpin, whose essence is mighty powers and stern Judgment, over which the power of mitigation holds sway only afterwards.
<b>...her five mighty powers.</b> The powers revealed in Yesod of Imma are already recognizable as having the aspect of severity, and accordingly it is from there that Zeir Anpin receives its root.
<b>In accordance with this essential nature, each light stands by itself and does not join with any other.</b> For the nature of Zeir Anpin can be compared to a dejected soul whose inner powers stand quiescent without arousal or excitement, making the face show only dejection. However, when these soul-powers are aroused and excited, the face shows laughter and happiness. These innate soul-powers exist in the soul all the time, but when each power stands separately without flashing in excited interaction with the others, this is the state of dejection.
<b>This is because the nature of Judgment is not to display brotherly love. Rather, all is dejection and angry faces.</b> For the nature of Kindness is that of the welcoming right arm, and when love reigns, the creations themselves all behave to one another in a brotherly manner, showing each other smiling faces. But the state of stern judgment is one of hatred and rejection. The faces show anger, and everything is heavy with depression.
We have here two things that are bound up with one another – the plane of the roots (the Sefirot) and that of the creations. For Kindness begets love, and through it the soul radiates with joy, showing a smiling face. Judgment, on the other hand, begets hatred and rejection: the soul is dejected and does not radiate, while the face shows anger. Accordingly, on the plane of the roots, when the Sefirot are levels of stern judgment that push the creatures away without allowing them to become attached to them, those very levels themselves stand in a corresponding state of “dejection”, lacking joy and excitement. However, when they are levels of kindness that bring love to the lower creations, there is a corresponding increase of joy and excitement in those very levels. Moreover, as you have already heard, the Sefirot are the measures of all that exists, and the Supreme Mind calculated the state in which the creations should exist in their time of disrepair, when each is separated from the other through hatred and dejection.
The state of disrepair below is thus bound up with the state of disrepair above, because you have already heard how aspects that lie at the root of the creations are actually visible in those creations themselves. Thus the separation and alienation seen in their root aspects (i.e. on the level of the Nekudim) correlate to the separation and alienation actually manifested among the created beings. (Thus when they are separated from one another, it is an indication of division and separation among their roots.)
<b>However, Imma overcomes this with her sweetening power.</b> This is the underlying mystery of how Imma completes Zeir Anpin, becoming “bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh” (cf. Genesis 2:23; see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar HaMochin</i> ch. 1). For Zeir Anpin is intrinsically on the side of stern Judgment, while Imma gives him a share of the power of mitigation that is in her intrinsic nature. To the exent that Imma increases this sweetening influence, so the severity of Zeir Anpin is mitigated. And this is the key to the concept of the different mentalities (מוחין, <i>mochin</i>) of Zeir Anpin in immaturity (קטנות, <i>katnut</i>, “smallness”) and maturity (גדלות, <i>gadlut</i>, “greatness”). In the stage of immaturity, only the external aspect of this function of Imma is given to Zeir Anpin, causing minimal mitigation. However, as Zeir Anpin attains greater mental levels, the severity of the Judgment becomes increasingly mitigated, until it becomes completely sweetened.
The principle of stern Judgment is that its intention is to do justice and chasten the wicked. However, to the extent that it is mitigated, it does not carry out evil, and when it is completely sweetened it actually does good. At the same time, He remains the King of Justice, for the innermost heart of Zeir Anpin is to execute stern Judgment, except that the power of mitigation gains sway over this, causing the severity to sink down.
<b>As the stern Judgment subsides, so the dejection passes and brotherly love reigns.</b> The power of stern Judgment does not pass entirely but only subsides on account of the power of mitigation that holds sway over it. However, there is no change in the essential nature of Zeir Anpin. It is only the pain and sorrow that pass, for this is what results when stern Judgment holds sway.
<b>It is for this purpose that Imma enters into Zeir Anpin...</b> i.e. as mentioned above, Imma becomes “bone of his bones...” (through giving him her Netzach-Hod-Yesod). <b>...and makes brotherly love reign among his Sefirot.</b> This is the bond in which Imma binds together the different parts of Zeir Anpin with flashing excitement and joy.
<b>This is done through Malchut...</b> The underlying principle here is that “Whoever remains without a wife remains without joy” (<i>Yevamot</i> 62b). This is also the mystery of Shabbat. The greatness of the Shechinah – the female aspect – lies in bringing completion to the male. The underlying principle is that Imma does not rest upon Zeir Anpin except when the Nukva is with him, as is clear from many passages in the <i>Zohar</i> and <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i>. This is explained by the fact that the Nukva is the root of the recipients, and when the lights wish to shine blessing on their recipients, everything is full of joy and radiant excitement – “God will rejoice in His works” (Psalms 104:31). However, this depends on the deeds of those in the lower realms. When the lower realms are ready, it means that the Nukva, which is their root, is prepared and ready to be filled (becoming a receiving vessel). The lights then flash with great power and joy, and all the gates are opened. Tzaddik, the active influence, is then blessed from Imma above and becomes filled with all good. However, if the lower realms are not prepared, God forbid, it means that their root – the Nukva – is not ready to receive. Of this it is said, “It grieved Him in His heart” (Genesis 6:6). All the lights are then occluded, and this is the mystery of, “The waters are gone from the sea (=Nukva) and the river (=Zeir Anpin) is parched and dried up” (Job 14:11), as explained in various places.
Thus it is Imma, who governs Zeir Anpin, that brings all this about. When Imma sees that the Nukva is ready for Zeir Anpin, Imma becomes aroused and directs Zeir Anpin using her mitigating influences, causing shining faces and joy everywhere. Blessing and sustenance then flow with abundant joy in the mystery of coupling and union (זיווג, <i>zivug</i>), as will be explained in its appropriate place with the help of Heaven (see Opening 138).
<b>For Malchut was instituted as the container vessel for all of them...</b> This is what brings about the connection and joining both above and below. Above – on the level of Zeir Anpin – all the lights are focused on one place, and the intention in everything is to benefit the creatures of the lower realms and fill them at their roots. The entire will is focused on this, and then everything goes towards this in one flash of excitement. All the different kinds of thoughts and strategies are directed to this one end with the radiant excitement of love.
Consider this mystery as we see it here below. When all the souls are able to attach themselves to the Shechinah (Divine Presence), each one then shows love to the other and Israel are called “one nation on earth” (Chronicles I, 17:21 etc.). For they literally become brothers and friends who are all running towards a single goal. However, when this is not the case but instead each is intent only on his own one-sided gain, there can be nothing but hatred. However, such a bond can exist only at a time of great repair, such as at the time of the Giving of the Torah at Sinai, of which it is written, “Israel encamped there facing the mountain” (Exodus 19:2; the singular form of “encamped” indicates their unity at that time, see Rashi ad loc.). And it will be the same in the future.
<b>...so that instead of each light shining separately by itself, they are all directed to one single place.</b> It has already been instituted as a law that all the influences come through Malchut. Accordingly, when Malchut is aroused, this connection is aroused as a matter of course. Now the mystery of Malchut is that of the Assembly of Israel (כנסת ישראל, <i>Knesset Yisrael</i>), i.e. everything goes only to this one place, and she arouses the actual love of the Supreme Mind in every aspect, for the higher powers are directed to her alone. Accordingly, as soon as she is ready to receive, all the lights – because of the love between the Holy One, blessed be He, and the Assembly of Israel – become aroused and directed continually towards her, which automatically creates a bond of connection and mutual excitement between them. It is like a man who has tremendous love for his son or his wife, and all his thoughts are only to benefit them. When they approach him, his soul takes fire with all its powers and he gives his son or wife his exclusive attention.
<b>A connection then develops between them...</b> As already explained, when the Nukva is ready, the connection is aroused as a matter of course. <b>...and they all turn to Malchut...</b> Thus the sages commented on the verse, “And I will turn to you” (Leviticus 26:9) – “I turn aside from all my other business” (<i>Sifra</i>). This means that all the supreme thoughts are directed only to Israel, which is the main essence, and therefore all the lights turn to shine to the Shechinah, and they leave everything else aside for this. <b>...as the “hind of love” (Proverbs 5:19)...</b> This is a term of affection for the Nukva, indicating that when she is ready, love is aroused towards her.
<b>...and they themselves join with one another.</b> This is the mystery of the mutual flashing that I have mentioned: the greater the joy, the more the soul radiates with all its powers, and likewise the supreme lights all become merged in a single bond for the sake of the Shechinah.
<b>The more they turn to her, the stronger the bond of brotherly love between them, and this brings great joy.</b> After the first stirrings of arousal, the excitement becomes continually more intense, because the attachment of the receiver becomes ever stronger, as does the attachment of the active influence (Zeir Anpin), while Imma in turn increases her various influences. We already know from our own feelings and experiences that this is the nature of the interaction.
<b>Part 2: This is what was lacking in the Primordial Kings...</b> As we have already stated, initially they were not made in their state of repair. And this is what was lacking, for evil as such did not yet exist but only the initial state of Zeir Anpin in the aspect of strict Judgment. Indeed, the Supreme Mind wanted to measure and display the functioning of strict Judgment in all its intrinsic severity, not as it appears when sweetened. Only afterwards was it to be revealed how it is mitigated, in order to display the functioning of the power of mitigation. For the entire supreme intention was to conceal the perfection in order to display the deficiencies and then show their repair and how it comes about. It was therefore necessary for each aspect to appear individually. Afterwards, the government of the world follows the same path so as to serve as the root to reveal this knowledge through the creations themselves with their unique form and qualities, and through the order of government to which they are subject.
<b>...for the Six Directions were not turned towards Malchut...</b> This shows the essential nature of the entire creation – how everything is directed only towards those in the lower world, specifically Israel in the mystery of the Assembly of Israel. This is the meaning of the verse, “God will rejoice in His works” (Psalms 104:31): the arousal and flashing of the lights depend entirely on the creations in the lower world. Here the purpose of man’s service is clearly evident, because here we see the link between the lights and the Assembly of Israel. As long as the latter was not in a state of repair or readiness for the supernal lights, all the gates were closed. When she is ready, they are immediately opened. The stronger the attachment of the lights to her, the wider open the gates become. The key to all this is the Supreme Imma (אימא עילאה, <i>Imma Ila’ah</i>), who closes or opens the gates according to how ready the Nukva is for Zeir Anpin. We thus see how when the Nukva was not prepared for the Six Directions, everything went to ruin (and the vessels broke).
<b>...and therefore did not escape the sadness and angry faces...</b> Strict Judgment stood in its full force. Here we can see clearly how man’s service brings about repair. Since the only purpose of strict Judgment is to withhold His influence from the lower creations during the time when they are not prepared, there is no other remedy except that the lower creations should be ready, and then He will send blessing. Accordingly, as long as the Nukva is not prepared, sadness reigns and this is what prevents the lights from shining since they do not reveal their goodness at all unless there is a vessel ready to receive them.
We thus see that the first thing rooted in Zeir Anpin is stern Judgment in its sad aspect, as stated above – except that the mitigation comes and removes it. Accordingly, prior to the arrival of the power of mitigation, stern Judgment stands in all its sadness. The effects of this state are what the Supreme Mind wanted to reveal first.
<b>...and Imma still allowed them to remain that way.</b> It is clear from what we have already explained that the intention was to show what develops out of Judgment unless it is mitigated.
<b>Accordingly, the first three Sefirot of Zeir Anpin were missing...</b> For the first three Sefirot were not revealed in Zeir Anpin in order to show what develops out of strict Judgment if it is entirely alone without Imma’s mitigating influence. For in the later phases after the breaking of the vessels, this is something that no longer existed – i.e. Zeir Anpin is not found without the mitigating power of Imma, because even in the immature state (קטנות, <i>katnut</i>), Zeir Anpin still retains certain mental powers (מוחין, <i>mochin</i>). Thus the state of breakage was worse than the state of immaturity, for when the vessels were broken, the influence of Imma was not present at all, and as a result there was literal destruction, “formlessness and void” (Gen. 1:2).
Likewise, the flood, which caused literal destruction, also resulted from a re-arousal of the breaking of the vessels, except that there was a certain difference. For in the flood the breakage was not absolute since there was an aspect of Imma that remained – the ark. For this reason, the earth was not completely destroyed but only to the depth of the plow, though I will not elaborate on this now. It is sufficient for you to understand that the state of breakage causes literal destruction, while the state of immaturity does not cause so much damage but results rather in exile. Of this it says, “I saw the land and behold, formlessness and void” (Jeremiah 4:23). Nevertheless this is not formlessness and void in the literal sense, because the world did not return to actual formlessness and devastation.
<b>...for these result from Imma’s entry into and repair of Zeir Anpin.</b> As I wrote above, Imma became “bone of his bones”. For the intrinsic essence of Zeir Anpin is only strict judgment – the Six Directions – while the mental powers (מוחין, <i>mochin</i>) are the mitigation – Imma.
<b>The others were then termed the domain of the many (רשות הרבים, <i>reshut harabim</i>, “the public domain”)...</b> This is the name given to them by the sages of the Kabbalah, and it applies when they were arranged one under the other (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Shevirat HaKelim</i> ch. 3). For proper government must be based on the consensus of all the Sefirot, as will be discussed later, and they need to stand facing one another with the center column joining them together. This way the effect is produced with the agreement of all the different levels, and this is termed the domain of unity (רשות היחיד, <i>reshut hayachid</i>, the “private domain”).
However at first they were not given this repair, but each one was a separate matter, as if each one had to send its influence on its own, i.e. not through Malchut. Each one sent forth its own separate influence, and this is something that causes excess in the separate creations – excessive separation and dissension. In this state there is no interrelationship between the different Sefirot except in terms of the developmental sequence whereby Gevurah emerges from Chessed, Tiferet from Gevurah, and so on. However they were not interconnected in a single governmental order in which everything stood together.
It was like one person who has many thoughts but does not go the full way in considering the connection between his various thoughts in order to produce a perfect result. Instead he dwells on one thought all by itself, then on another... but he does not weigh them against each other so as to bring everything together as a single whole.
What emerges is in a state of complete disunity, with no interconnection between the different kinds. By understanding this we can also understand the nature of the Other Side, as it goes on to say. And the truth is that this is not the mode of blessing and sustenance, and accordingly, when they were in this state, they were unable to exert any influence.
<b>...and this was the state from which the Other Side emerged...</b> As I have already explained, at first all the different aspects of the governmental order were calculated individually, until the entire process could be seen before us like a set table – from the concealment of the perfection until its return to be revealed again – so as to understand thereby how evil reverts to good through the mystery of the unity, as stated above. Afterwards, each individual calculation by itself gave rise to one corresponding offspring among the separate creations. Thus different entities and contingencies emerge in the separate realms as manifestations of different aspects of the overall process. The nature of the different creations depends on the nature of their root, and they function according to that nature to the extent to which they are permitted in accordance with the overall direction of the complete governmental order (since the governmental order is the source of the separate creations).
<b>...which is why its nature and function are only to cause separation.</b> This is its whole purpose – to withhold the influence of the active source of influence from the recipients, to thwart the supernal lights both in general and in particular in order to close off their light. This is the way it was during the time when the judgment was unmitigated, and this restricted the flow of influence, as explained above. For it cannot be said that there is a flow of influence in a state of separation, for this is impossible, but rather, if there is a state of separation, the influence is withheld.

Chapter 53

<i>The order of the repair</i>
<b>All that was damaged at the time of the breakage had to be progressively repaired little by little. This includes both the descent of the hind parts of Abba and Imma and the breaking of the other Sefirot, because everything that was lacking during that time started to be replenished during the time of the repair. And everything will eventually be fully complete in the perfect repair that will come about in time to come.</b>
<i>Having explained the main details of the breaking of the vessels, we must now explain how the course of the repair was influenced accordingly.</i>
This proposition is made up of two parts: <b>Part 1: All that was damaged...</b> This introduces the subject of the repair of the breaking of the vessels. <b>Part 2: This includes…</b> This explains the course of the repair.
<b>Part 1: All that was damaged at the time of the breakage...</b> For the whole intention was to show what happens when strict Judgment is unmitigated, in order to show afterwards how its sweetening rectifies everything. Since the total damage caused by the breakage constitutes everything that can happen when strict judgment is not mitigated, the power of mitigation – the repair – had accordingly to be displayed through the repair of all this damage.
<b>...had to be progressively repaired little by little.</b> Here again we have the principle of gradation. For the Supreme Will did not want complete perfection to be revealed all at once, but rather, little by little. This is what provides a place for men to acquire merit.
<b>Part 2: This includes both the descent of the hind parts of Abba and Imma and the breaking of the other Sefirot...</b> For the breaking of the seven lower Sefirot is a deficiency in the roots of the separate creations, while the descent of the hind parts of Abba and Imma is a deficiency in that which repairs those roots. Together they make up the totality of all the damage, and both must be rectified. Both were repaired together, for the repair comes at one and the same time: as one was repaired, so was the other. For if the three first Sefirot continually repair the seven lower ones, it follows as a matter of course that the latter are constantly reaching better states of repair. Conversely, if the seven lower Sefirot are constantly reaching better states of repair, this signifies that there is no deficiency in the radiation of the first three Sefirot, which bring about their repair.
<b>...because everything that was lacking during that time...</b> All the individual repairs that had to be brought about were lacking owing to the damage caused by the breaking of the vessels, and they include many particulars.<b> ...started to be replenished during the time of the repair.</b> As explained earlier, the Supreme Mind brought about a certain degree of repair through the power of God, and afterwards left the rest to be done little by little by man. <b>And everything will eventually be fully complete in the perfect repair that will come about in time to come.</b>

<big><strong>The 288 Sparks (Openings 54-58)</strong></big>
<i>What happened to the vessels when they were broken. The difference between the breaking and the repair.</i>
<b>During the time when the vessels were broken, the power of government was taken from them. They also did not stand arranged in a complete form. Rather, they were various kinds of incomplete powers that were unfitted to carry out any function. And their source maintained them in this state until a new radiation came that was to complete them and give them form and function.</b>
<i>Having explained what happened when the vessels broke, we must now explain what happened thereafter.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: During the time when the vessels were broken...</b> This explains in general terms what happened to the vessels during the time when they were broken. <b>Part 2: And their source...</b> This explains the difference between the breaking and the repair.
<b>Part 1: During the time when the vessels were broken, the power of government was taken from them.</b> The concept of being broken applies to things that are unfit to carry out their function. This has two meanings that are both really one. For as you have already heard, the Sefirot are the underlying measures of all that exists (i.e. of the separate realms and beings) and the Sefirot themselves are also the laws of government. In other words, it is the separate creations that are subject to the governmental order, while the Sefirot are the laws of the governmental order itself. Thus when one part holds sway over the creations, it results in one type of government, and when a different part holds sway, the result is a different type of government.
Thus when the Supreme Mind made the calculation of how the creations would exist in an unrectified state, when strict Judgment is unmitigated, the consequence was quite evident: only defects could exist in these creations – the creations themselves were damaged. The creations then appeared as if they had lost their ability to carry out their good function, and only their bad parts ruled over them, causing damage to their intrinsic form. Corresponding to this state of destruction on the level of the creations, what we see above (on the level of the Sefirot in their broken state) is faulty laws of government that are unable to accomplish anything. This is the destruction and ruin explained earlier (see Opening 37, Part 1), which did not allow the good laws to operate, with corresponding effects on the creations.
<b>They also did not stand arranged in a complete form.</b> Breaking means two things. It means that the vessel is unfit to carry out its work (the Sefirah does not have the power to govern), and also that its form or structure is imperfect. The one results from the other. It is because of the imperfection in its form that it is unfit for its work. Sometimes a thing can break in such a way that it retains a form fit for some other work. However, when the breakage is very great, it is left in no form for any kind of work. The breaking of the vessels was a breakage that left no form whatever, in the sense that the broken vessels were the measure of the creations when in a state of existence lacking all repair. In their broken state, the vessels themselves are governmental laws that are unable to execute any creative function (פעולה של הויה, <i>peulah shel havayah</i>).
<b>Rather, they were various kinds of incomplete powers that were unfitted to carry out any function.</b> It is not that the creative powers and laws (הויות וחוקים, <i>havayot vechukim</i>) ceased to exist. They existed, but they could not function in any way at all because of the great damage and destruction, which they could not escape. Thus they existed, but they lacked what they needed in order to be able to function.
<b>Part 2: And their source maintained them in this state...</b> For they did not cease to exist, which means that their source – the lights – were in existence, and the source maintained them in existence, except that it kept them in existence in a state of disrepair, and they were not repaired until the arrival of a new radiation, as it goes on to say.
<b>...until a new radiation came...</b> For this was only one state, as discussed earlier (see Opening 36 Part 2) in connection with the mystery of the scattered sparks (which kept the broken vessels in existence). Afterwards, the Supreme Will wanted to complete and perfect the Form of Man in all its aspects. It was then that a new radiation came to complete them, this being the name of MaH, as will be discussed later.
<b>...that was to complete them...</b> through giving them proper existence. This is the mystery of the selection and purification, whereby the name MaH sifted out and gathered to itself parts of BaN, as will be discussed later. <b>...and give them form and function.</b> This is their state of existence as the Partzufim, which were made afterwards through the mystery of rectification, as will be discussed below.

Chapter 55

<i>AV is Arich Anpin, the root of AV, SaG, MaH and BaN – Abba and Imma, Zeir and Nukva.</i>
<b>When two or more names reach the same numerical total through different pathways, it is understood that this is a single essential root with which each one must be joined. Each follows its own pathway, but at the end of its winding and turning, that is where it reaches. And this is the mystery of the name of AV (72), which is contained in the four names of AV, SaG, MaH and BaN. For while each one has its own individual pathway, they all arrive at this. This shows that it is one essential root which all of them must reach, each one in its own way. And the truth is that this comes from Arich Anpin, from which Abba and Imma, Zeir and Nukva emerge. Thus Arich is one single AV whose four Yuds bring forth AV, SaG, MaH and BaN. And each one of them must arrive at the meaning indicated by its root, which is the name of AV, and this is the strongest power they contain.</b>
<i>We have explained that the vessels continued to exist during the time when they were not functioning, and later (Opening 57) we will discuss how this came about through the order of the 288 sparks. We must now explain some general matters that need to be understood first. (For an explanation of the four main expansions of HaVaYaH, see the note at the beginning of Opening 22.)</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: When two or more...</b> This sets forth the general principle involved here. <b>Part 2: And the truth...</b> This explains how that principle applies in the matter under consideration.
<b>Part 1: When two or more names reach the same numerical total through different pathways...</b> For each name can only expand in accordance with its constituent letters and the particular way in which they become “filled”, and if so, they must necessarily follow different pathways in order to reach the same total. For we are not now talking about cases where the sums of the numerical values of the constituent letters of various names are simply equal, because this has a different significance: it is then clear that the names in question are related to one another in terms of their number, and both are involved in a total number of functions identical to the simple numerical value of the names. Here, however, we are dealing with a phenomenon that signifies something different, inasmuch as we see a single total which the various names can reach only by expanding in different ways. (The numerical values of the various expansions are not simply equal, but different numerical operations must be performed in order for them to reach the same total, as explained in greater detail below.)
<b>...it is understood that this is a single essential root with which each one must be joined.</b> For as you have already heard, number is not merely arbitrary and without reason. Quite the contrary, it is of great significance since it shows the number of powers that join together in the function in question. The reason for any given number of powers is bound up with the type of control exercised by the different levels that rule in the function in question, as already discussed in connection with the subject of the “trees” (see Opening 31). For the rule of one level gives rise to one array of powers as signified by the particular expansion associated with it, while the rule of another level gives rise to a different array and expansion. According to the expansion, so are the functions that emerge in the same numbers on those different levels. Thus when two names are seen to arrive at the same total, it is understood immediately that this number is one essential order which the other levels have to reach. (Since this number is an essential root, it is also essential in the other names. Thus not only the expansion of AV but also all the other expansions eventually reach the total of 72=CHeSSeD, showing that the root of all the different governmental orders is Kindness.)
<b>Each follows its own pathway, but at the end of its winding and turning, that is where it reaches.</b> Two things are involved here. (1) Each expansion follows its own individual pathway according to the different aspects that emerge from it, because each one gives rise to numerous effects and has great ramifications in the governmental order. (2) Nevertheless, all the different effects and ramifications lead eventually to the same goal, which is determined by one power that holds overall sway over all those different expanded names in all their ramifications.
<b>And this is the mystery of the name of AV (72), which is contained in the four names of AV, SaG, MaH and BaN.</b> This is already quite clear from the teachings of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and the holy ARI. For each of the four names contains 72 in a different way.
In the case of the expansion of AV itself, 72 is the simple sum of the numerical values of its constituent letters. In the case of SaG (=63), we reach 72 by also reckoning an additional ten units for the ten individual letters of the expansion aside from their numerical value. (63 + 10 = 73; the extra unit is the <i>kolel</i> signifying the overall unity.) In the case of MaH (=45), we reach 72 when we reckon the numerical value of the simple name (=26) without adding units for the letters. Thus 45 + 26 = 71 (and one extra unit for the <i>kolel</i> brings the total to 72). In the case of BaN (=52), we reach the total of 72 when we reckon the fourfold form (ריבוע, <i>ribu’a</i>) of the Name, i.e. Yud (10) + Yud-Heh (15) + Yud-Heh-Vav (21) + Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh (26) = 72.
<b>For while each one has its own individual pathway, they all arrive at this.</b> As we have just said, in order to reach this total, different calculations are necessary in each case.
<b>This shows that it is one essential root which all of them must reach, each one in its own way.</b> This means that it was necessary overall (and not only in connection with our present subject of the fall of the 288 sparks) that these names should exhibit this phenomenon. At the same time, it has a particular significance in the present connection, notwithstanding all the other reasons for the numerical values of each of the different expansions, as explained in the writings of Rabbi Chaim Vital. For how could it be pure chance and for no reason that each of the different expansions has a way of reaching the total of 72? This must certainly have significance, for we see that it has to be this way. On the contrary, we find so many reasons for it to work out this way that there must necessarily be some underlying internal cause.
<b>Part 2: And the truth is that this comes from Arich Anpin, from which Abba and Imma, Zeir and Nukva emerge.</b> This is bound up with the underlying mystery contained in the teaching in the <i>Idra Zuta</i> (p. 288a) that “only the Torch is found by itself”. It is impossible to compare the relationship that Abba, Imma, Zeir and Nukva have with Arich Anpin to the relationship that Zeir and Nukva have with Abba and Imma. Abba and Imma, Zeir and Nukva are all levels that clothe Arich Anpin, for Abba and Imma clothe Arich from the throat to the navel, just as Zeir and Nukva clothe Arich from the navel and below. However, Arich Anpin cannot be said to clothe a particular level, since it is one Partzuf that encompasses the entire universe from the top all the way to the bottom, while Abba and Imma, Zeir and Nukva are all branches of it and clothe it.
And the truth is that, as taught by the ARI, nine Sefirot of Arich Anpin are called essential roots of Atzilut, while all the other Partzufim are branches of Arich (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i> ch. 2). Accordingly we must consider them two levels: Atika Kadisha (the “Holy Ancient One”) is Arich Anpin, while the other four Partzufim are together called the “Name of Atika”, as explained in the <i>Idra</i> (ibid.).
<b>Thus Arich is one single AV whose four Yuds bring forth AV, SaG, MaH and BaN.</b> For we see that there are these four names of AV, SaG, MaH and BaN, which are respectively Abba and Imma, Zeir and Nukva, but we find no name for Arich Anpin, and sometimes AV is Arich Anpin. The explanation is that there is a name AV that is the essential root of all the other four names, which issue forth from its four Yuds. For we already know that each Yud indicates a Havayah, as stated in the <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i>. And this overall AV is Arich Anpin, and from the four Yuds emerge AV, SaG, MaH and BaN, which are Abba and Imma, Zeir and Nukva.
<b>And each one of them must arrive at the meaning indicated by its root, which is the name of AV...</b> For they are surely four garments or branches of Arich Anpin in that each one performs its own separate function, and accordingly each one of them has a name of its own signifying its individual function. But in one respect they are all equal, and this is that they emerge from a single root and are thus four different particulars emerging from one root. And this is precisely what they must show – that their individual functions all emerge from the same root. This is why each one in its own individual way, according to its intrinsic nature, must arrive at the meaning indicated by its root, which is the name of AV.
<b>...and this is the strongest power they contain.</b> For the fact that the root is visible in the branches shows how the root and branch are joined together. Clearly the strongest power in Abba and Imma, Zeir and Nukva is the fact of their being attached to Arich Anpin, which is the root. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, since the root is the source, as long as the branch is attached to it, the root sends into it a great power of endurance. Secondly, since Arich Anpin itself is the great and awesome root that is beyond the reach of any flaw or damage – because the Other Side does not reach there in any way – accordingly, when Arich Anpin radiates in the branches, its attachment to them certainly puts great power in them through the very great power which it possesses.

Chapter 56

<i>The difference between the name AV contained in AV, SaG and MaH and that contained in BaN</i>
<b>Although the fourfold number, which is AV (72), exists in all the names, only what is particular to each of them individually is considered intrinsically their own. It is only in the case of BaN, which does not have its own particular AV, that the AV contained in the fourfold form of the simple name is considered intrinsic to it. This shows that each one of them has an equal meaning at the outset, even in its simple aspect, because this is in accordance with their essential being. But when their letters are filled – which is when they become different from one another – each one of these names is given a meaning of its own in accordance with the function that it performs by itself. And BaN, which does not function by itself but receives what is given to it, therefore has no other meaning, and joins with the others through the primary, overall meaning.</b>
<i>Having discussed the AV present in all the names, we must explain one particular matter that appears problematic in connection with the 288 Sparks.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: Although the fourfold number...</b> This presents the answer to a problem that seems to arise in connection with these four AVs. <b>Part 2: This shows...</b> This provides a deeper understanding of the answer.
<b>Part 1: Although the fourfold number, which is AV (72), exists in all the names, only what is particular to each of them individually is considered intrinsically their own.</b> For a certain problem exists in connection with the 288 Sparks (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar RaPaCh</i> ch. 3, 87a). We are faced with a dilemma. Either we are saying no more than that the numerical value of AV (72) will be found in the simple, “unfilled” (or unexpanded) form of each of these names wherever they are (i.e. in each one’s “simple” Havayah in its fourfold form of Yud, Yud-Heh, Yud-Heh-Vav, Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh, which has the numerical value of AV=72, as explained in the previous Opening in connection with BaN). Or else we are saying that this total must be found specifically in the “filled” (or “expanded”) form of the names (the מילוי <i>milui</i>, as explained in the previous Opening in connection with AV, SaG and MaH).<br> If we are saying the former (that AV is in each case found in the simple, unfilled Havayah in its fourfold form), then we can reckon that all Havayahs in their fourfold form contain AV without taking account of the expanded form of the name. However, if this is not enough – because what is not specific to the filled or expanded form of any given name is not reckoned as AV inasmuch as we want to find it in the filled forms themselves – then you may object that BaN does not produce an AV from its filled form but only in its simple, fourfold form, and this cannot be reckoned as being particular to BaN since it is present in BaN in just the same way as it is in the others.
And therefore comes the answer: It is true that AV exists in each one (in the fourfold form of the simple, unfilled Havayah in each case), and it is indeed the truth that in the case of AV, SaG and MaH, the fourfold form is not taken into account in the operation whereby they reach 72 in their expanded form, signifying their connection with Arich Anpin (the overall AV). The reason why we do not take the fourfold form into account in the case of AV, SaG and MaH is that they each have another AV particular to their individual function besides the AV that exists in all of them by virtue of their simple form. BaN, on the other hand, does not have any other AV (i.e. one particular to itself through its filling or expansion), and therefore shows its relation with Arich Anpin (the overall AV) through the AV contained in its fourfold form.
This is precisely the point: even though BaN has no other AV, this does not make it an exception to the rule through having nothing that shows its root, for it certainly does have something that shows its root. Except that in this case, what it has is only the fourfold form of the simple Havayah. What AV, SaG and MaH have over and above BaN is the fact that besides the AV contained in their fourfold form, they also each have their own particular AV in their filled or expanded form. Thus the intent is properly fulfilled, showing that no branch can escape being included under Arich Anpin, which is its root. For even BaN, which does not have its own particular AV, nevertheless does at least have the AV that exists in it by virtue of its being a Havayah (whose simple, unfilled, fourfold form = 72 = AV). The reason for this difference will be explained below.
<b>It is only in the case of BaN, which does not have its own particular AV, that the AV contained in the fourfold form of the simple name is considered intrinsic to it.</b> This is as we have explained, that even BaN does not lack the presence of AV in some way, despite the fact that it does not have its own particular AV.
<b>Part 2: This shows...</b> As I have written, the various numerical values are not arbitrary and without reason, but show a great deal about the different orders of government.
<b>...that each one of them has an equal meaning at the outset, even in its simple aspect...</b> For as soon as they exist, they already give an indication of their root, in that the start of their existence is as four names of Havayah, for this is how they are implied in Arich Anpin in four Yuds all equal to each other, and this is in their aspect as being lights – branches – of Arich Anpin. (The four expansions of Havayah derive from the four Yuds contained in the expansion of the overall AV – Yud, HeY, VaYV, HeY.) However, because each one has its own particular function, they all have their own individual filled or expanded forms. The intention is indeed to show that even though they are different levels, in the end they are all only the name of Havayah, blessed be He. If so, their original essence is the primary category – the name of Havayah, blessed be He – but afterwards they receive additional individual functions. The filled or expanded forms themselves indicate the particular function that each one has.
Thus their original essence (as simple Havayahs) already indicates their root (through the fourfold form=AV=72). Then afterwards their particular functions still also point to their root, to show that even in their individual aspects they remain attached and bound to Arich Anpin, which is the root.
<b>...because this is in accordance with their essential being... i.e. as an order of simple Havayahs. But when their letters are filled – which is when they become different from one another...</b> It is quite clear that in their aspect of being Havayahs they are identical, and it is in their filled or expanded forms that they differ. The intention may be explained as follows: in their intrinsic essence they are all equal – they are all lights of one kind, for they are all the name of Havayah, blessed be He, and as such they all indicate their root in the same way. However, their individual functions are different, and this is seen in their filled or expanded forms. It is therefore necessary that each function should indicate the overall root in accordance with its specific nature in order to show that in this aspect too it is attached to its root, and this is its particular meaning. Thus:
<b>...each one of these names is given a meaning of its own in accordance with the function that it performs by itself.</b> For when their purpose or function changes, there is also a change in the way they indicate the root (through the filled or expanded form of the name).
<b>And BaN, which does not function by itself...</b> Just as AV, SaG and MaH each have their own particular functions, so the particular function of BaN is not to act but rather, to stand and receive. <b>...but receives what is given to it...</b> i.e. the function of the name BaN is to receive rather than to act <b>...therefore has no other meaning...</b> For this particular meaning (possessed by AV, SaG and MaH by virtue of the unique way in which each one expands to reach the total of 72) is given to them in order for them to carry out their functions, which they draw from the root. However, BaN does not act at all but receives whatever it is given. Everything that BaN receives, it receives in accordance with the root, since all the different kinds of functioning derive from the root. Accordingly, no particular meaning is applicable in the case of BaN but only the primary meaning, which shows that its light is also in the category of Havayah, just as in the case of all the others. It is thus understood that it receives from others, which is why it has no other signification, for it does not act.
<b>...and joins with the others through the primary, overall meaning.</b> In any event, BaN must also enter into this category so as to signify how the root has control over the branches. The way it enters into this category is by virtue of what is prepared within it in order for it to be included in the root in accordance with the portion which the root gave it. For it did not give it any active function whatever but only existence as a light in the category of the simple form of the name of Havayah, blessed be He.

Chapter 57

<i>The function of the overall AV – 288 sparks – is to prevent the destruction of the vessels and the world.</i>
<b>The essence of the Chariot consists of these names of AV, whereby the four Partzufim gain strength from Arich Anpin, which is beyond the reach of the damage. And here the Throne carries its bearers. It was therefore necessary for 288 sparks to descend from here to hold and sustain the vessels as they were descending so that the destruction would not be complete but only such that it could be repaired again. The affairs of this world were thus rooted in such a way that one power should endure so as not to allow the world to be destroyed, God forbid. Rather, through this remaining power, what was damaged will be repaired.</b>
<i>Having discussed the overall significance of this name of AV, it is necessary to explain its function and purpose in relation to the broken vessels. (The 288 Sparks correspond to the numerical total of the four names of AV=72 contained in the four Partzufim, as explained in the previous Opening: 4 x 72 = 288.)</i>
This proposition consists of three parts: <b>Part 1: The essence of the Chariot...</b> This explains the function of the overall name of AV that we have been discussing. <b>Part 2: It was therefore necessary...</b> How this affected the vessels. <b>Part 3: The affairs of this world...</b> How it affects the world.
<b>Part 1: The essence of the Chariot consists of these names of AV...</b> The Chariot is the overall bond of the entire governmental order, which consists of four levels, which are the four Chayot. Their essential function is bound up with these four names of AV, which are the mystery of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David, as explained in the teachings of the ARI (<i>Pri Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> ch. 7).
At first sight this may appear problematic, for if these are the number of lights that descended at the time of the breaking of the vessels, as appears from the discourse on the 288 Sparks (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar RP”H</i> ch. 2), what connection do the four legs of the throne – Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David – have with this? However, the main point to grasp is that the root of these four names of AV lies in the mystery of the Chariot, as stated, but that from here various aspects of them descended lower, as will be explained below.
<b>...whereby the four Partzufim gain strength from Arich Anpin, which is beyond the reach of the damage.</b> As explained earlier, the name of AV signifies the root (which is Arich Anpin) and is accordingly the source of their strength. <b>And here the Throne carries its bearers.</b> In other words, a reference to this phenomenon is contained in the saying of the rabbis that “the Throne carries its bearers” (see <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Pekudey</i> 242), alluding to how the power of Arich Anpin rescues the other Partzufim from the damage.
<b>Part 2: It was therefore necessary for 288 sparks to descend from here...</b> Very many sparks were in the process of descending with the vessels, as explained at length in the Kabbalistic sources. Afterwards, however, it was necessary to make a specific number of them so that they would come to a total of 288. For if not for this, it would have meant either that there was no need for any specific number at all, or that all the sparks that descended would have been counted as one, or that the first levels in each name would have been counted. But the essential principle is that it was in these sparks that fell that this matter of the four names of AV had to be revealed, and then all those levels were sorted and purified in the way explained in its appropriate place, until eventually these four names of AV remained in control, and all the others were included in them. And the truth is that the names of AV themselves radiate in a specific way in each name in accordance with the nature of that name, in order to lift them up above the damage, each one according to what befits it.
In other words, the levels that we see to have fallen with the breaking of the vessels are the very levels that the damage had the power to reach. And since there is a difference between the place the defect reaches in one name and the place it reaches in a different name, there is a difference in what will fall when the vessels break. Similarly, there is a difference in the way the name of AV is revealed, because it is revealed in whatever can become damaged, inasmuch as it is the main factor involved and it is this that lifts them up.
The sum of the matter is that it is through these names of AV that Arich Anpin lifts up the Partzufim, but it raises them in the place where they could be damaged, each in accordance with its particular nature. And the place where they were susceptible to being damaged became evident through the actual process of the breaking of the vessels, in that whatever fell is known to be that which was susceptible to being damaged. We thus find that what descended did so from the category of AV, and accordingly it is this that is counted, except that it is in the place where it is – in AV’s levels. But if it had not gone down from AV but instead the sparks had descended according to the status of the names, either all of them would have been counted, or they would not have been counted at all.
<b>...to hold and sustain the vessels as they were descending...</b> This is a consequence that flows from what was explained earlier (Opening 30) that even though the unity becomes concealed, it necessarily continues to exist. Accordingly, even at the very moment of destruction, the destruction was not total but took place through the mystery of unity, whereby the unity does not prevent the Other Side from exercising great power yet still does not allow it complete control. <b>...so that the destruction would not be complete...</b> i.e. total negation.<b> ...but only such that it could be repaired again.</b> So that afterwards it would be able to be repaired again.
<b>Part 3: The affairs of this world were thus rooted...</b> For everything that comes about in the Sefirot is nothing but a root for what is required in the lower creations.<b> ...in such a way that one power should endure so as not to allow the world to be destroyed, God forbid.</b> Nothing was to fall so far that no part of the light would be left to sustain it. If death is a fall, the vapor of the bones remains. If there is exile, the Shechinah never stops shining light over Israel.<b> Rather, through this remaining power, what was damaged will be repaired.</b> Even though what remains may be small, this is what maintains things in such a way that the repair will follow afterwards.

Chapter 58

<i>MaH (Yesod) builds Nukva (the deficient BaN), after which Zeir Anpin sends her a flow of blessing.</i>
<b>The beauty and delight of Malchut are only in her when Yesod is with her, for through Yesod she becomes complete, whereas when Malchut is without Yesod, she is the source of all deficiency and sadness. But when Malchut is with Yesod, she is the source of all joy for the male himself. Accordingly, at first everything was in the mystery of BaN, which is Nukva (the female) without the male, which is the source of all sadness. And the Six Directions (Zeir Anpin) did not turn to Malchut, because they did not receive delight. But when Yesod came in the mystery of MaH, she was then completed and she herself arouses delight in the male himself, and this is the repair.</b>
<i>This is the answer to an apparent contradiction in the teachings relating to the Primordial Kings. On the one hand we are taught that they were from the side of Malchut and were therefore lacking repair (</i>Etz Chayim<i>, </i>Shaar Shevirat HaKelim<i> ch. 8, 47a). Elsewhere, however, we find that, on the contrary, it is the rule of Malchut that brings the repair (</i>Etz Chayim<i>, </i>Derushey HaNekudot<i> ch. 3, 37b).</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: The beauty and delight...</b> This explains how Malchut is the source of joy and of sadness. <b>Part 2: Accordingly...</b> How this relates to the Primordial Kings.
<b>Part 1: The beauty and delight of Malchut...</b> As explained earlier, Malchut is the “hind of love” (Proverbs 5:19) that arouses love in the lights and causes them to flash in excitement, for it is to Malchut that the terms beauty and delight apply. Beauty results from properly ordered repairs with no mixture of darkness but everything arranged to serve as a perfect order of government with all the repairs and adjustments necessary for the flow of good. Delight results from beauty, and thus the verse continues: “...and a roe of grace” (<i>ibid</i>.). The Hebrew word for “roe” (יעלת, <i>ya’elet</i>) has the connotations of elevating and enhancing. In other words, the lights flash forth to greet her in the way that a father’s love is aroused for his son when the latter meets with his approval, or in the way that a husband’s love is aroused for his wife.
<b>...are only in her when Yesod is with her...</b> This is explained in many places in the <i>Zohar</i> and <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i>, and this is the mystery contained in the verse, “The advantage of land is in everything” (Ecclesiastes 5:8). This is the mystery of the moon, which in its intrinsic nature is a “glass that does not shine”, yet through the power of the sun, she shines and is seen to be beautiful, as it says, “beautiful as the moon” (Song of Songs 6:10).
Such is the nature of Judgment (Din) and all that comes from it. If it is mitigated, it is the source of all joy (for the recipients justly deserve their reward and there is no “bread of shame”). But if it is unmitigated, it is the source of all evil, which is not so in the case of Kindness (Chessed). Fire is also like this: if the heat is at the necessary level, it provides great satisfaction, but if it is too hot, it burns. So it is with wine: if one drinks in moderation, it is “the wine that brings joy”, but if one drinks to excess, it is the wine that intoxicates. This is the mystery of the Nukva. If she is mitigated and sweetened with kindly influences (חסדים, <i>chassadim</i>), she arouses every kind of joy and love. But if she is unmitigated, on the contrary, she causes every kind of sadness. Yesod’s mission is precisely to sweeten Malchut.
<b>...for through Yesod she becomes complete...</b> For Yesod gives her what is suitable to bring her to a state of completeness and mitigation. However, the governmental order is so arranged that the Shechinah is not rectified on her own but her repair depends upon Yesod.
<b>...whereas when Malchut is without Yesod, she is the source of all deficiency and sadness.</b> As we have said, if she is not complete, she is the source of all deficiency. It is like unripe fruits, which because they are not ready or complete are bad, but when they become ripe, are sweet and good.
<b>But when Malchut is with Yesod, she is the source of all joy for the male himself.</b> This is the concept of “the hind of love” (of which it is said, “...let her breasts satisfy you at all times” – Proverbs 5:19). This is when she is already like a fruit that is ripe and ready.
This enables us to resolve the apparent contradiction mentioned above. When we say that it is the rule of Malchut that causes the repair, this is the rule of Malchut<i> with</i> the light of the male. However, when we say that the Primordial Kings were deficient because they derive from the name of BaN, this is because they are from Malchut <i>without</i> the light of the male.
<b>Part 2: Accordingly, at first everything was in the mystery of BaN, which is Nukva (the female) without the male...</b> As we have explained, when we say that the Primordial Kings derive from BaN, this means they derive from the category of Malchut when unconnected with the light of the male. <b>...which is the source of all sadness...</b> in accordance with the mystery of, “Turn away your eyes from me” (Song of Songs 6:5). As explained in the <i>Zohar</i>, this means that as long as the Nukva is not sweetened through Yesod, Zeir Anpin turns away from her and is unwilling to send a flow of influence. This is when the sadness previously mentioned reigns, when the lights are closed up.
It could be objected that we have stated that all Nukva’s perfection derives from the Yesod, which is the male. If so, then as long as the male does not turn towards her, she is incomplete. But as long as she is incomplete, the male does not turn to her. If so, how is she to become complete?
The answer is that when we say that the male (Zeir Anpin) <i>turns</i> to her, this is to give her a flow of sustenance, but this is not the same as when we say that Yesod shines in her, which is in order to build her. The shining of Yesod in Malchut is something that depends on the extent to which she is built, which in turn depends on the deeds of the lower creations. Yesod is what actually builds Malchut, which it does when she is completed through the deeds of the lower creations, since she is their root, as discussed earlier. The entire influence of the male (i.e. when Zeir Anpin turns to her) is of plenty and blessing, but this is not the actual building of Malchut (which is carried out by Yesod). This blessing comes to her after she has already been entirely built through the deeds of the lower creations.<br> (To summarize: At first it is necessary for Yesod to shine in the Nukva in order to build her, and Yesod shines in her according to the degree of perfection of the deeds of the lower creations. This applies to the governmental order. However, when the world was first created, Yesod built the Nukva without any existing deeds on the part of the lower creatures but rather through the power of the anticipated future deeds of the righteous. After the Nukva is built by Yesod, Zeir Anpin then turns to her to give her sustenance and blessing.)
<b>And the Six Directions (Zeir Anpin) did not turn to Malchut, because they did not receive delight.</b> Although Malchut too already existed as one of the Sefirot, she did not arouse favor and delight because her structure was still deficient.
<b>But when Yesod came in the mystery of MaH, she was then completed...</b> For in the Sefirot of MaH it was included as part of the governmental order that Yesod should radiate in Malchut. We thus find that the governmental order is such that all the structures and worlds are in the category of Malchut as already rectified through Yesod (i.e. the exterior is united with the interior), and thus the building of Malchut is complete. For this is what causes all the openings and flows of influence.
<b>...and she herself arouses delight in the male himself...</b> The repair of BaN was so instituted that when the Nukva receives completion from the side of Yesod (MaH), the male (Zeir Anpin) immediately comes and joins with her, i.e. AV, SaG and MaH join with BaN in the mystery of “about three months after” (Genesis 38:24) as explained in the teachings of the ARI. This is the order of repair of the worlds at all times through the mystery of male and female. But the overall male is included entirely in MaH, and the Nukva – BaN – receives from MaH. Initially she receives the radiation of Yesod which completes her construction, after which she also receives the flow of sustenance and blessing. All the worlds were afterwards built in accordance with this rectified order.
<b>...and this is the repair.</b> The entire essence of the repair depends on this overall connection, for once it was brought about in the overall root of the governmental order, it came about detail by detail in the worlds themselves, as will be explained below. (The connection of MaH and BaN first came about generally, and afterwards in detail in each individual world.)

Chapter 59

<big><strong>The World of Repair (Openings 59-69)</strong></big>
<i>The root of the repair – the joining of MaH and BaN: interrelation and kinship between the Sefirot</i>
<b>The repair consisted of the binding together of the two radiations of the forehead and eyes of Adam Kadmon, these being MaH and BaN. There was an immediate awakening of love between the lights, and they are no longer in a state of dejection as at first. Instead, each one shows a friendly face to the other, and all the Partzufim are bound up with one another in accordance with the mystery of Father and Mother, Son and Daughter, where each shows kinship to the other in the manner that is befitting.</b>
<i>Having explained what was involved in the breaking of the vessels, we now come to explain the repair that was brought about thereafter.</i>
This proposition consists of three parts. <b>Part 1: The repair consisted of the binding together...</b> This is the first root of the repair. <b>Part 2: There was an immediate awakening of love...</b> This explains the resulting offshoots of this root. <b>Part 3: ...and all the Partzufim are bound up...</b> This explains the new order that came into being accordingly.
<b>Part 1: The repair consisted of the binding together of the two radiations...</b> This is the first root that was produced, and after this, a number of other consequences followed. This is what the <i>Sifra DeTzeniuta</i> refers to as the “balance” (מתקלא, <i>matkela</i>), as will be discussed below (see Opening 69). This consisted of the joining of these two radiations together, and the result of their connection is the love found in all the Sefirot that emerge from them, as discussed below.
<b>...of the forehead and eyes of Adam Kadmon...</b> The forehead is bound up with the mystery of the breaking through of the lights of the Tefilin, as mentioned earlier. (See Opening 32, Part 1 end: “The forehead also emits its own radiance...” i.e. from this phenomenon in Zeir Anpin it is inferred that the same applies to Adam Kadmon even though there is no mention of Tefilin in the case of the latter.)
<b>...these being MaH and BaN.</b> It is clear that the light emerging from the Forehead is MaH, while that which had already emerged from the Eyes is BaN, as discussed earlier (Opening 34, Part 1).
<b>Part 2: There was an immediate awakening of love between the lights...</b> For the root above was instituted in accordance with the mystery of Male and Female, which are MaH and BaN. Thus all the Partzufim that emerge from the Forehead and Eyes of Adam Kadmon are stamped with the same nature as the root, and thus the offshoot radiates with love in the proper way (being compounded of MaH and BaN).
<b>...and they are no longer in a state of dejection as at first. Instead, each one shows a friendly face to the other...</b> This means that in the governmental order, they are arranged each one towards the other, facing each other with an expression of love, each light flashing forth in the direction of the other (signifying cooperation between the Sefirot). This is not how it was at first, when they were one under the other. Now each stands in its appropriate column facing the column of the other with an intermediary joining them together. The governmental order is thus produced as a single bond, for the right and left sides are parallel. Nevertheless, they still do not pass on their influence until the center column joins them together with one accord so that everything reaches one place, this being Malchut, which is underneath. Thus the governmental order emerges through consensus and sound counsel, without each Sefirah being alone as at first, as discussed earlier.
<b>Part 3: ...and all the Partzufim are bound up with one another...</b> The innovation brought about through the repair was precisely that all the levels join together to produce their effects with one accord, so they can properly be called by the name of Father and Mother, Son and Daughter, which was not so in the case of the Primordial Kings, which were called only Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet and Malchut (i.e. they are referred to as Sefirot but they were not Partzufim). The reason is that there was no interrelation between them. In the repair, however, a complete interrelation was produced. Thus Binah is also related to Chochmah as its Nukva, and indeed, it is impossible for Chochmah to function except with Binah, or for Binah to function without Chochmah. The same applies to Zeir Anpin with the Nukva. Likewise, the relation betwen Zeir and Nukva on the one hand and Abba and Imma on the other is like the relation of children to their parents.
The sum of the matter is that the entire order of the Sefirot was instituted on the foundation of a governmental order based on consensus, with interrelation and kinship between light and light. Not a single light stood alone without some relationship with all the others. For example, Imma has a relationship with Abba inasmuch as Imma is Abba’s receiving vessel, and Imma has a relationship with Zeir and Nukva since it is Imma that brings them forth. Zeir Anpin has a relationship with Abba, which is Zeir Anpin’s root, with Imma, which brings Zeir Anpin forth, and with the Nukva, which is Zeir Anpin’s receiving vessel. The same applies to all of them. Thus the entire repair consists of producing this bond between the various levels.
<b>...in accordance with the mystery of Father and Mother, Son and Daughter...</b> In other words, this developmental sequence is called a complete array (in which each Partzuf is in its proper place). For the result is the Son or the Daughter, depending on whether the influence is that of Kindness or Judgment, while the causes of the result are two: Father and Mother.
<b>...where each shows kinship to the other in the manner that is befitting.</b> The nature of this developmental chain governs the relationship that each one must have with the other. The kinship of each Partzuf with the others, as stated above, is according to its place in the developmental chain. (Thus since Zeir and Nukva develop from Abba and Imma, they are in the category of a son and daughter – and the governmental order follows this developmental sequence – while the relationship between Zeir and Nukva is like that between a brother and sister.)

Chapter 60

<i>BaN and MaH were bound up under Malchut and Yesod of Adam Kadmon, and then coupled together to bring about the repair.</i>
<b>After the emergence of the lights of the Eyes of Adam Kadmon – these being BaN – they were bound under the rule of Malchut of Adam Kadmon. And when the radiation of the Forehead – MaH – emerged, it was bound under the rule of Yesod of Adam Kadmon. Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon then coupled together, and thus the stern judgments were sweetened and the government operated in a mode of repair and love.</b>
<i>This answers an apparent difficulty regarding the Primordial Kings and their repair. For in one place the Primordial Kings (=BaN) are said to have come from the Eyes and MaH from the Forehead (</i>Etz Chayim<i>,</i> Shaar Derushey Nekudot <i>ch.1). Elsewhere, however, the Primordial Kings are said to be bound up with the mystery of Malchut of Adam Kadmon while MaH is the drop of male waters of Adam Kadmon’s Yesod (</i>Etz Chayim<i>, </i>Seder Atzilut<i> ch. 2; see Opening 96 below).</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: After the emergence...</b> This explains the places where these lights were bound. <b>Part 2: Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon then coupled together...</b> This explains the resulting path taken by the repair.
<b>Part 1: After the emergence of the lights of the Eyes of Adam Kadmon – these being BaN – they were bound under the rule of Malchut of Adam Kadmon.</b> For the nature of the lights is such that, besides the original sources from which they emerged, we must also take into account the sources to which they are bound and from which they take their power and rule in the governmental order. In accordance with this principle, these lights emerged from the Eyes and were afterwards bound to Malchut of Adam Kadmon and received their governmental power from there.
<b>And when the radiation of the Forehead – MaH – emerged, it was bound under the rule of Yesod of Adam Kadmon.</b> In other words, since the purpose of this radiation was to repair the first lights, it was bound up under Yesod, which is the power that repairs Malchut.
<b>Part 2: Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon then coupled together...</b> After these lights emerged from the Eyes and Forehead and had been bound under Yesod and Malchut, Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon then coupled for the sake of the lights bound up with them.
<b>...and thus the stern judgments were sweetened...</b> This coupling caused a sweetening of strict judgements throughout the entire governmental order.
<b>...and the government operated in a mode of repair and love.</b> After this sweetening was accomplished in the governing luminaries (מאורות, <i>me’orot</i>), namely Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon, everything subject to their government was likewise governed in a mode of love and repair, and thus the government of the worlds operated in this mode of repair.

Chapter 61

<i>The connections between MaH and BaN produce the “Tree” – Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. The repair is completed through men’s deeds.</i>
<b>MaH went through the process of joining up to Him all the levels that were being selected from BaN, out of which He produced the entire Tree of Holiness, namely Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. However, there remained further levels of BaN that were not attached to MaH. Accordingly the creation was not yet complete, because it contains certain deficiencies. This is steadily repaired little by little until eventually everything will be repaired and everything will be in a state of complete perfection.</b>
<i>We have already explained the overall repair – that the government operated in a mode of repair. We must now explain things in greater detail. The first thing that must be explained is the interconnection between MaH and BaN.</i>
The proposition consists of three parts. <b>Part 1: MaH went through the process of joining...</b> <b>Part 2: However, there remained...</b> <b>Part 3: This is steadily repaired...</b>
<b>Part 1: MaH went through the process of joining up to Him all the levels that were being selected from BaN...</b> We explained earlier (Opening 54) that the Sefirot of BaN, which were the first to emerge, were awaiting another radiation that would repair them. For as already explained, the Primordial Kings (the Sefirot of BaN) were merely one aspect of the Likeness of Man which the divine Mind rejected. Now, however, came the true completion of the Likeness of Man which emerged from the Supreme Mind. And then even those aspects which had originally been producing evil started turning back to good.
The repair was not brought about in the vessels in order to bring them to return to a state of repair by themselves. (The repair did not operate on the vessels themselves. Rather, it came about through the construction of the Partzufim out of the lights of MaH and BaN combined, and the vessels were then repaired as a matter of course as each entered its proper place in the structure of the Partzufim. The vessels – from BaN – thus could not be repaired by themselves but only through being connected with the lights of MaH.) For the Sefirot of BaN – which were in a state of breakage – were aspects that took control only at the time when the Likeness of Man had not yet been revealed. (Their existence was temporary from the very outset.) But with the emergence of the essential Likeness of Man – MaH – the repair of these initial aspects also followed as a matter of course.
The way this root is seen in the people of Israel is as it is written: “The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise” (Amos 5:2). Yet it is also written: “I will raise up David’s fallen tabernacle” (ibid. 9:11). In other words, when the Assembly of Israel fell, it was because the Supreme King had not yet properly revealed His glory, which is the root of the governmental order. As long as it still waits to be revealed, all that has happened happened. The Holy One, blessed be He, did not merely want to restore them to what they were on their own so that they would rise from their fall by themselves. He wanted to bring them to a new state of being through which they would be repaired. (The <i>Zohar Pekudey</i> 239b states that the raising up is accomplished only through the Holy One, blessed be He.)
This new state is the mystery of “new heavens and a new land” (Isaiah 65:17). “I will raise up David’s fallen tabernacle” – through the mystery of MaH, which enables BaN to stand. BaN cannot stand by itself and can only be lifted up with the emergence of the new light of MaH, which is the main root of the governmental order. (If they had rectified themselves, they would only have returned to their initial state of repair, but He wanted to bring them to a greater state of repair – one of complete repair.) It then retrospectively becomes apparent that everything that took place even from the outset was for good. (When the vessels enter into the structure, it is revealed that even the bad part was for good because of the function it plays in the world.) All the bad then reverts to good, this being BaN as repaired through MaH. The root of what was to come about in the world is found here in this process that took place in the Sefirot.
<b>...out of which He produced the entire Tree of Holiness.</b> It was necessary for the governmental order to consist of two things joined together: deficiency on the one hand and the complete perfection that repairs it on the other. For all this successively makes known God’s unity. (Without the preceding deficiency, there would be no revelation of the unity.)
Thus the Supreme Mind set to work making all that it made through this repair, until all the different levels and Partzufim were produced, all constructed out of parts damaged in the earlier destruction together with the repair that came to fix them (the parts of MaH and BaN from which the Partzufim were made). It is in this mode that the world is now governed, and now the completion of this repair in all its details is in the hands of man.
<b>...namely Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah.</b> As explained earlier (in Opening 35), Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah are one whole (and are therefore jointly referred to as the “Tree”).
<b>Part 2: However, there remained further levels of BaN that were not attached to MaH.</b> As explained earlier (in Opening 35) regarding the Primordial Kings, there remained certain levels that had yet to be sifted out, and these are the parts that bring perfection.
<b>Accordingly the creation was not yet complete...</b> In the light of what I have said, this should be clear – because certain pathways were lacking in the governmental order and certain parts of the creations were also lacking. It is therefore obvious that the original creation still needed to be completed. This is the meaning of “...which God created <i>to do</i>” (Genesis 2:3). He started in order that the work should be completed by mankind.
<b>...because it contains certain deficiencies.</b> This is the clear proof of the above assertion that the creation was not complete – because there are deficiencies in the creation, and it is therefore not in a state of complete perfection. For when it is complete, there will be no more deficiency left, just as in the case of an artefact whose manufacture is complete.
<b>Part 3: This is steadily repaired little by little...</b> As explained earlier (Opening 53 Part 1), the process of repair proceeds in stages, power after power, until the end.
<b>...until eventually everything will be repaired and everything will be in a state of complete perfection.</b> This too is as I have written above, that all this is a continuous progressive cycle until everything is altogether perfect.

Chapter 62

<i>The Sefirot of BaN are the root of defects and punishments, while facing them are the Sefirot of MaH, which repair them.</i>
<b>In the Sefirot of BaN are rooted all the different aspects of damage – i.e. everything that provides a place for the existence of defects and the ensuing punishments. In the Sefirot of MaH are rooted all aspects of the repair – to repair these defects. For the sake of the required governmental order, it is necessary for every level to be constructed out of both of them. Then all aspects of evil will exist in that level through the side of BaN within it and all aspects of good through the side of MaH.</b>
<i>Having introduced the subject of the joining of MaH and BaN, we must now specify the different effects of each one.</i>
This proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: In the Sefirot of BaN...</b> This explains the separate functions of MaH and BaN. <b>Part 2: For the sake of the required governmental order...</b> This explains how they are joined together.
<b>Part 1: In the Sefirot of BaN are rooted all the different aspects of damage...</b> The Sefirot of BaN are the roots of the various kinds of damage, as already explained earlier, while the Sefirot of MaH bring them back to good, as stated above. But because things were not permanently fixed to perfection, the Sefirot of MaH may hold sway over those of BaN, producing only good. On the other hand, it is also possible, heaven forbid, for BaN’s intrinsic nature to be reawakened since this has still not been completely changed. This can prevent MaH from holding sway over the Sefirot of BaN, out of which come forth the various kinds of damage.
<b>…i.e. everything that provides a place for the existence of defects...</b> For the phenomenon of damage and destruction is ordered in such a way that if pathways had not been prepared whereby the lights can be darkened and flawed, this phenomenon of damage would simply not exist in the world. However, the pathways have already been prepared with exact precision and measure, neither less nor more than what is required. This is the cause of the flaws in the lights above and the punishments in the world below, as it goes on to say. Overall these pathways are in accordance with the rule of BaN.
<b>...and the ensuing punishments.</b> This is obvious, because when the lights are darkened above (through sin), the person who caused this suffers a corresponding interruption in the flow of goodness, and this is how the governmental levels of the Other Side gain sway over him. For the Other Side has the opportunity to attack through this flaw (in the lights caused by the sin), and as long as some trace of that flaw remains above, the Other Side deals out evil to the perpertrator commensurate to his deeds. The flaw steadily disappears in accordance with the punishment suffered by the sinner.
<b>In the Sefirot of MaH are rooted all aspects of the repair – to repair these defects.</b> They are parallel: the repairs of MaH come to repair the damage of BaN. It was through this arrangement that the joining of MaH and BaN was brought about. For the above-mentioned defects require precisely those repairs that have the power to rectify these very defects.
<b>For the sake of the required governmental order...</b> In other words, in order to produce a governmental order based on the required principle of reward and punishment to make a place for free will <b>...it is necessary for every level to be constructed out of both of them.</b> For every level has a corresponding level of service on the part of man, and man’s whole service is based on free will. Wherever there is choice, there is the possibility of damage and repair, reward and punishment. This is why every level must be constructed out of both of them. <b>Then all aspects of evil will exist in that level through the side of BaN within it and all aspects of good through the side of MaH.</b>

Chapter 63

<i>For every function and for each effect there are two generators through the coupling of male and female – Kindness and Judgment coming from MaH and BaN – and likewise in the soul and body.</i>
<b>Since the government operates in this way on the foundation of Kindness and Justice, a root of good and a root of evil, accordingly for every function two generators are required. Therefore any given light will only emerge through two lights that draw it forth. Of these two lights, one will be male from the side of MaH and one female from the side of BaN. They will then produce the light that needs to be produced – built out of MaH and also BaN.</b>
<i>Having discussed the overall functions of MaH and BaN in the governmental order, let us now explain the effects of their joint functioning.</i>
There are two parts to this proposition: <b>Part 1: Since the government...</b> This is a prefatory statement about the offspring or effects of the functioning of the Sefirot. <b>Part 2: Therefore any given light...</b> The developmental chain through which the lights emerge is founded on the mystery of Male and Female.
<b>Part 1: Since the government operates in this way on the foundation of Kindness and Justice...</b> – namely for the sake of reward and punishment – <b>...a root of good and a root of evil...</b> All these things are aspects of one process – Kindness and Justice for the sake of reward and punishment. And so too man’s service involves the possibility of both damage and repair.
<b>...accordingly for every function...</b> For everything has to emerge with the consensus of two sides. If what emerges comes from the side of good, this is what rules and evil agrees to it. If the opposite is the case, God forbid, then the opposite applies. Accordingly every act or function (פעולה, <i>pe’ulah</i>) contains a part of both of them. This includes the functions involved in the governing of the creations, and likewise the actual creations themselves, which, as we already know, emerge from the same root as the functions that govern them. Thus each creation exhibits one of the functions that constitute the governmental order. The same applies in the case of the supernal lights as they develop to serve the needs of the governmental order. (Each light also has two generators – from the side of Kindness and Judgment.)
<b>...two generators are required.</b> For the causes need to be suited to the production of their required effect, and thus we refer to two generators or producers (מולידים, <i>molidim</i>).
<b>Part 2: Therefore any given light will only emerge...</b> The beginning of this phenomenon is in the supernal lights, as stated above, for it is these that were generated for the sake of the governmental order. Each light has its own particular function, and this light will only emerge in the developmental chain if it has for its root two suitable causes in order to jointly produce their effect – the light – which then emerges compounded of both of them.
<b>...through two lights...</b> This is the nature of the developmental sequence (השתלשלות, <i>hishtalshelut</i>), whereby each light is emanated by and emerges from another light. It is caused by that light in accordance with the principle of gradation. <b>...that draw it forth....</b> The emanated light is a particular detail whose source is from the Supreme Will, this being the Master of all the powers, which are revealed by Him one by one. Since He wanted to display things in a graded way, level by level, He instituted the entire developmental sequence so as to show in an orderly manner what comes first and what comes second. In order to display this continuity, it was necessary for one light to draw out another from the Supreme Source. This comes about through the mystery of new mental states (התחדשות המוחין, <i>hitchadshut hamochin</i>) and coupling (זיווג, <i>zivug</i>), as will be explained below in its appropriate place, with the help of heaven. (It is not that the lights which couple together bring the light they produce into existence, but rather, they draw it forth from the Supreme Source.)
<b>Of these two lights, one will be male from the side of MaH and one female from the side of BaN.</b> The Supreme Will wanted to display the developmental sequence in stages, power after power, until the creation attains perfection, as explained earlier (Opening 10). This is the concept of His creating “in partnership with the letters” as explained in the <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> (<i>Tikkun</i> 69, p.115b), for many powers must exist in order to produce one thing. It is necessary to know which is the first power and what derives from it afterwards in order to understand the way in which the particular creation in question was produced. Accordingly, He displayed the powers as developing one out of the other, as stated above.
This works in the same way as the human mind, which contains various powers. The functioning of the mind is marked by ever-renewed excitement in the form of the new thoughts or new levels of understanding that enter the mind. (The new thought comes in the wake of the excitement produced by the previous thought, although the new thought is not actually caused by it. So too in the case of the overall developmental chain: the Source of all the lights is indeed in the Supreme Will, but they are revealed in stages, one after the other, because the eternal Will continually creates everything.)
Indeed, the entire functioning of the soul, whether through the body or within the soul itself or through the interconnection of different parts of the soul – i.e. the vital Nefesh with the intelligent soul, etc. – everything is all through the mystery of coupling (זיווג, <i>zivug</i>). In other words, in order to display the developmental sequence, a fit cause must exist in order to produce each effect, and this is the concept of a Partzuf. (The construction of a Partzuf is brought about through the coupling that takes place between two higher Partzufim.)
The way in which the effect is produced is not through flashing excitement alone, but rather through the functioning of the different individual aspects of the Partzufim involved – by means of actual coupling. The roots begin in the mind and brain of each of the powers involved and continue down by way of their organs of procreation – the Yesod in each case. Two causal factors underlie every level in the developmental sequence. One provides the overall root, and one provides the specific preparations and repairs for that entire generality.
This is the underlying mystery of male and female as we actually find them in this world: the seed comes forth from the male, while it is in the female that its form is steadily delineated and it undergoes its necessary repairs. Two pathways are involved in this, for the female also produces seed, as our rabbis stated: “The woman emits seed of a red color...” (<i>Niddah</i> 31a). This means that the very material (חומר, <i>chomer</i>) itself contains a part that relates to the female, and this is the red-colored component in the body. However, besides this, the fact is that the male side provides the power governing the overall form. This means that the power governing the overall form of the Likeness of Man exists through the power of the male, while the details of the design are from the side of the female (see Ramban on Leviticus 12:1).
Thus we find that when the Supreme Will wanted to display His powers in this way, He adopted the way of the human mind, even though He did not need to. Humans go through a series of thoughts, one after the other, in accordance with a certain pattern, stage by stage, even though God could have created everything with a single utterance. But He wanted to show how each power develops, from where it emerges, what is its overall cause and what it is that produces its various specific details and everything else that can possibly be discerned in it. Accordingly He so ordered His powers – i.e. those that relate to the creation of the worlds – in such a way that they should function in this way we call the way of male and female, just as the powers of the soul function in the soul itself (through Chochmah and Binah, which are in the category of male and female). The Partzuf is the way in which the causal agent must stand in order to be fit to draw forth and reveal its effect. In this way the various powers of the soul themselves become differentiated into their particular components, and then they have the power to produce new effects. If not, they would not have this power.
We have thus found two aspects that involve the principle of male and female. The effect comes about only through the operation of the two factors of male and female (1) in the aspect of the preparations (the male provides the overall generality while the female divides it into particulars) and also (2) in the aspect of the parts of the actual effect itself. (Some of the characteristics of the resultant effect derive from the side of the male – Kindness – while some of its characteristics derive from the female – Judgment.) Accordingly they divide up in such a way that the male draws down the white (=Kindness) and the female the red (=Judgment). The first aspect, that of the preparations, whereby the male sends a general influence while the female delineates the details, will be explained below, with the help of Heaven (Opening 64). At this point it will suffice if we discern the principle of male and female in the interaction of MaH and BaN, for both are required as a generating cause, the one contributing one part – i.e. MaH – and the other a different part – i.e. BaN.
<b>They will then produce the light that needs to be produced – built out of MaH and also BaN.</b> This is because the intention is that the resultant effect should also be joined together in the same way. Accordingly two generators are required so that each one can provide that part in the resultant effect.

Chapter 64

<i>The role of the Male and Female in the channeling and repair of MaH and BaN</i>
<b>Out of the totality of the Sefirot that broke and descended, those parts that are to be selected undergo the process of sorting and selection, and the vessels ascend to receive their lights in Atzilut – and this is through the Female aspect, which lifts them up in this way. Descending towards them are levels of MaH, vessel and light, and they join with them – and this is through the Male aspect, which channels them in this way and puts them in the Female. Nevertheless, the Male also enters into the repair of the vessels that ascend through the Female: the Male repairs the right side of all the vessels and Partzufim, while the Female repairs their left side. And afterwards the parts join up together, and thus MaH is joined together with every one of them, and the resulting offspring is complete.</b>
There are two parts to this proposition: <b>Part 1: Out of the totality...</b> This explains the process of channeling by the Male and Female aspects, so as to produce or “give birth” to the light that has to be born from them. <b>Part 2: Nevertheless, the Male also enters into the repair...</b> The Male aspect even enters into what is channeled by the Female aspect in order to complete the repair.
<b>Part 1: Out of the totality of the Sefirot that broke and descended...</b> We now come to discuss the process of selection that took place in the totality of the Primordial Kings (the Nekudim), as discussed earlier (see Opening 47, Part 1).
<b>...those parts that are to be selected undergo the process of sorting and selection...</b> In other words, in order to establish the laws of the governmental order, there is a process of selection which takes place out of the totality of all the different aspects contained in the Primordial Kings, so as to choose whatever is fit to be in this law that the Supreme Mind wants to establish.
<b>...and the vessels ascend to receive their lights...</b> It is obvious that the vessels must receive the lights in order to govern properly. <b>...in Atzilut...</b> That is, in the Atzilut of the second Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah, which were made out of the original Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah (see above, Opening 46). For by now the levels had already been changed around, and four places were already prepared: Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. The vessels had hitherto been in the mode of descent and decline. Thus for them, this is considered an ascent (even though they ascend only to the second Atzilut, which is in the place of the original Beriyah), inasmuch as they come to serve as the government of Atzilut, the root of the present governmental order, the place of the emanation of all the lights.
<b>…and this is through the Female aspect...</b> All the different aspects of the cleansing and selection of these vessels, including both the aspects that are connected with their ascent and those connected with how they receive their lights, in short, everything that comes into the category of BaN – depends on the arousal of the Female aspect, which lifts them up. <b>...which lifts them up in this way</b> – in all the different details that can be discerned in them (for the nature of the Female is to differentiate all the details).
<b>Descending towards them are levels of MaH...</b> The term “descending” applies to the mystery of the Male Waters, which are channeled down from above towards the Female, which is the place of the ingathering of the lights (the pregnancy is in the Female) so that they can be perfected through the mystery of the cause that brings things to completion, as discussed earlier.
<b>...vessel and light...</b> Clearly, this is in accordance with the nature of the governmental order. <b>...and they join with them...</b> For the intention is to produce MaH and BaN joined in one – to make literally one body, not two separate bodies.
It could be objected that we said above (Opening 61) that MaH chooses what is suitable from BaN, whereas here we are saying that it is in BaN that the process of selection takes place, and that the descent of MaH depends on BaN. The answer is that it is indeed true that this arrangement of MaH and BaN was made at the outset – which part of each was suited to which part of the other – and it was MaH that made the selection in accordance with MaH’s intrinsic nature. This was accomplished through the mystery of the drop of Adam Kadmon’s Male Waters that sweetened the Primordial Kings, as stated above, in accordance with the mystery of Yesod of Adam Kadmon that sweetened Malchut. From this foundation there subsequently emerged the Head that is not Known (רישא דלא אתידע, <i>Reisha delo ityeda</i>), as will be discussed later. Afterwards the overall Nukva went through the process of selecting what was suitable in accordance with the original supreme division that I have discussed earlier.<br> (In other words, initially MaH went through the process of selecting what could be repaired, with MaH providing the material for the repair – the Male Waters. Afterwards the Nukva correspondingly goes through the process of actually selecting what is fit to be repaired out of the breakage. The overall selection by MaH follows the pathways of the world of reward – the Head that is not Known, while the actual selection is carried out through the Nukva by means of the service of the lower creations.)
<b>…and this is through the Male aspect, which channels them in this way...</b> in all their particulars – just as the Female makes the selection in BaN, so the Male selects the particulars of MaH.
<b>...and puts them in the Female.</b> As discussed earlier (Opening 63 Part 2), besides the Female’s providing part of the actual resultant offspring itself, the Female also delineates the form of everything, including the part contributed by the Male. The reason is that MaH and BaN exhibit aspects of the Line and the Residue which we discussed earlier (Opening 27). A fundamental principle relating to the Sefirot is that certain lights are the primary roots in some given function, and it is through them that what is required for that function is actually produced, while other lights merely display what is actually produced at root by the primary lights, and these secondary lights undergo processes corresponding to those taking place in the lights which they display. (The secondary lights are in the same category as the primary lights but in an inferior mode.)
Thus MaH and BaN are both together lights that emerge from Adam Kadmon, and both include vessel and light, which derive respectively from the Residue and the Line. However, MaH is made to display the Line, while BaN is made to display the Residue. Therefore the different aspects of BaN – both its lights and vessels – are discussed in terms of the intrinsic nature of the Residue and undergo processes relating to its function. All the components of MaH, on the other hand, are discussed in terms of the intrinsic nature of the Line, and undergo processes relating to its function. However within each of MaH and BaN we also differentiate between lights and vessels of their own (both have an aspect that is light and an aspect that is vessel), each in accordance with its intrinsic nature. For the light is always from the Line and the vessel from the Residue. However, the main thing is to understand things as they relate to one another.
The advantage of this pathway is that we need to arrive at man down below and all the material creations, which are merely an image of the entire governmental order. Their different individual parts and aspects are governed in accordance with what they signify in the governmental order, even though they are all in this lowly world. The Residue is the differentiation of the Line, because the powers that are all included in a single overall whole in the Line are differentiated into their particulars in the Residue in all its different parts, as explained in the appropriate place (see Opening 27 Part 3) in accordance with the mystery of soul and body. Accordingly the Male channels MaH and the power of the overall form, while the Female channels BaN and the different aspects of the form in detail, for it is in the Female that this offspring takes form.
<b>Part 2: Nevertheless, the Male also enters into the repair of the vessels that ascend through the Female: the Male repairs the right side of all the vessels and Partzufim, while the Female repairs their left side. </b>This enables us to resolve a seeming contradiction in the teachings of the holy ARI of blessed memory. In one place we find that the Nukva elevates the selected parts of BaN while the Male brings down MaH (<i>Mevo Shearim</i> II, Part 3 ch. 4). Elsewhere, however, we find that Abba selects the right-hand parts of BaN and Imma the left, as stated in connection with the mystery of the three days of conception (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Orot-Nitzotzot-Kelim</i> ch. 1; see Ramchal, <i>Klalut HaIlan HaKadosh</i> 4:2).
The resolution of the apparent contradiction is as follows: The channeling of BaN is through the Nukva, but when it comes to the repair and selection of the parts that ascend, the Male also enters into this, for the Male repairs the right side while the Nukva repairs the left.
<b>And afterwards the parts join up together...</b> And the reason is in order to repair the Kindness-Judgment-Mercy they contain, which was not repaired at first and needs to be arranged in them through the respective roots involved – Kindness through Abba, Judgment through Imma, and Mercy through Understanding, which produces connection. This was not necessary in the case of MaH, which had already emerged from the roots in a proper state of repair arranged in the mystery of three columns.
<b>...and thus MaH is joined together with every one of them, and the resulting offspring is complete.</b> In other words, what Abba himself channeled (not in partnership with Imma, for MaH was already repaired) was already composed of all these aspects, and now that BaN was rectified, MaH could join with it in all these rectified aspects.

Chapter 65

<i>Male and Female before the Nekudim. The Balance as the root of Male and Female thereafter.</i>
<b>The aspect of Male and Female is also found above this, since the governmental order had already been founded on the mystery of Kindness and Judgment. The difference in the Nekudim was that initially they lacked the proper repair of the aspect of Male and Female on account of BaN’s having emerged on its own. Only afterwards was MaH put into them through the process of the repair. Accordingly, every root involving Male and Female from Atzilut and downwards depends upon the Balance, which is the mystery of the joining of MaH and BaN.</b>
<i>This resolves a difficulty arising out of our earlier discussion in Opening 63 implying that the aspect of Male and Female was a new innovation after the repair.</i>
This proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: The aspect of Male and Female...</b> This initial premise explains that the aspect of Male and Female does indeed exist higher up, prior to the Nekudim. <b>Part 2: The difference...</b> This explains a particular aspect of the Nekudim whereby the above-mentioned difficulty is resolved.
<b>Part 1: The aspect of Male and Female is also found above this...</b> (i.e. in the worlds of Adam Kadmon above the Nekudim.) This is obvious, because it is evident in the teachings of the ARI (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Derushey HaNekudot</i> ch. 2 p. 36b) that the coupling of AV and SaG (which are in the category of male and female) took place before the emergence of the Nekudim.
<b>...since the governmental order had already been founded on the mystery of Kindness and Judgment.</b> This proves and also provides a logical reason for the existence of coupling prior to the repair. For this entire concept derives from the fact that since each limb is a composite of Kindness and Judgment, it must have two generators, as discussed earlier. However this combination also existed in the supreme lights after the Tzimtzum took place, as soon as there was a Line and a Residue (which are in the categories of Kindness and Judgment respectively). If so, there must likewise be two generators (in the category of male and female).
<b>Part 2: The difference in the Nekudim was that initially they lacked the proper repair of the aspect of Male and Female...</b> According to what we have just stated (that the aspect of Male and Female was present even before the Nekudim), how can we say that the aspect of Male and Female depends on the Balance (מתקלא, <i>matkela</i>), which originated only in the time of the repair? The answer to this difficulty is that the lack of the repair of the aspect of Male and Female was not overall but specific to the Nekudim. It was in the Nekudim that there was no coupling until after the repair.
<b>...on account of BaN’s having emerged on its own.</b> This is the particular reason applying specifically in the case of the Nekudim, in accordance with their intended purpose, as has already been explained. <b>Only afterwards was MaH put into them through the process of the repair.</b> The repair was a new state brought about in these worlds through the revelation of MaH.
<b>Accordingly, every root involving Male and Female from Atzilut and downwards depends upon the Balance, which is the mystery of the joining of MaH and BaN.</b> This is the sense in which we are saying that the aspect of Male and Female derives from the Balance. For the existence of Kindness and Judgment higher up did not cause the Nekudim to enter into the category of Male and Female owing to the difference in the case of the Nekudim, as explained above (that BaN emerged alone). It was only the Balance that introduced the aspect of Male and Female (since the Balance consists of the joining of MaH with BaN, which fixes the relative balance of the parts of MaH and those of BaN contained in each Partzuf), and accordingly we relate the aspect of Male and Female to the Balance. And obviously, since the aspect of Male and Female derives in this sense from the Balance, they are governed by the Balance throughout. For this reason we must recognize the Balance as the root of this aspect.

Chapter 66

<i>Coupling, Pregnancy and Birth</i>
<b>The repair of each aspect through the Male and Female comes about through the mystery of Coupling, Pregnancy and Birth. Through coupling, the respective parts of MaH and BaN are channeled until everything is placed in the Female. There in a single whole is found everything that needs to exist in the light in question so that there will be no need to add or subtract. Afterwards this overall whole must be differentiated into its detailed parts and the offspring is not revealed on its own until it is fully established in all its different parts as a complete revelation. Until that time it is therefore concealed within the light upon which it depends in order to receive its completion from it. This is because the lights of the one (the offspring) can only be completed through the lights of the other (the Female in which it is formed). When it has reached the stage where all its details are visible except that each contains only the minimum possible degree of radiation, the offspring is then revealed on its own, since there is no further differentiation that the light can undergo and it can only gain added power and radiance (the mental powers that enter during the time of suckling). Its being revealed from the higher luminary to the outside is what is called birth.</b>
<i>Having explained the overall subject of the institution of Male and Female, we will now enter into the details.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The repair of each aspect...</b> This introductory statement provides a general listing of the developmental stages instituted in the repair through Male and Female. <b>Part 2: Through coupling, the respective...</b> This explains these stages in detail.
<b>Part 1: The repair of each aspect through Male and Female comes about through the mystery of Coupling, Pregnancy and Birth.</b> For we already know that the entire repair is bound up with the underlying mystery of the Likeness of Man. Having reached this aspect of Male and Female, we may infer that all its various facets are governed in accordance with what this aspect involves here in the lower world – namely coupling, pregnancy and birth.
<b>Part 2: Through coupling, the respective parts of MaH and BaN are channeled...</b> It is already clear from the principle of sequential development (השתלשלות, <i>hishtalshelut</i>) that lights emerge from other lights. The channeling of the emergent light depends upon coupling through the arousal of the Yesods (of the parent Partzufim), for the Yesod possesses a unique power in this respect: this will be explained further in its appropriate place, with the help of Heaven.
<b>...until everything is placed in the Female. There in a single whole is found everything that needs to exist in the light in question so that there will be no need to add or subtract. </b>This is clearly the case, because the cause of the resultant light’s existence is only the coupling. Nothing can exist in any given subject without a cause. With the completion of the process of coupling, the first cause (the Male) has already completed giving what it has to give to the resultant light, and no other further causal factor acts in it. If so, nothing can exist in it that was not there already. It is quite clear that no other causal agent acts in the offspring that comes forth as a result of the coupling, for this offspring is precisely that which is able to emerge and exist only through the coupling. (There are no other concomitant factors.) Indeed, this is why this pathway was instituted as the particular pathway followed throughout the developmental chain of the lights. If so, once the coupling is completed, the cause (the Female) certainly contains all that has to exist in the resultant offspring that is to be built therefrom.
<b>Afterwards this overall whole must be differentiated into its detailed parts...</b> Clearly, this is always the way of gradation: first there is the overall whole, and afterwards this whole divides up into its constituent parts. <b>...and the embryo is not revealed on its own until it displays all its constituent parts fully revealed.</b> Since we are following the path of gradation, the fact is that no light can carry out its functions until all its constituent parts are revealed in it. (The path of gradation requires first the overall whole – through coupling – and afterwards the details – which develop during the pregnancy.) For all those parts are necessary in order to produce the required function. Thus as long as it has not reached this point, we cannot count it among the governing powers (i.e. as a Partzuf in itself).
<b>Until that time it is therefore concealed within the light on which it depends...</b> You have already heard how the Supreme Will wanted to reveal the powers by way of sequential development, showing how one emerges from another. Obviously there is no revelation of how the second emerges from the first until the first has truly produced it with its full array of powers. As long as the resultant light is not yet complete in this sense, it is merely concealed as an embryo within the power that produces it, until it gains sufficient power to reveal all of its own constituent parts. It will then appear on the outside as a single, complete governmental power that develops out of the first power. That first power will then go on to clothe itself within the resultant power, in the same way as all the higher powers clothe themselves in lower powers and direct them. Initially, however, the lower power is merely concealed within the higher power and is not revealed to the outside at all.
<b>...in order to be completed thereby.</b> I.e. in order to emerge sequentially with all its parts fully revealed.
<b>This is because the lights of the one (the offspring) can be completed only through the lights of the other (the Female in which it is formed).</b> This is the principle of sequential development that I have discussed.
<b>When it has reached the stage where all its details are visible...</b> Two things must be understood about each level (i.e. each Partzuf): the number of details it includes, and the degree of power they have. The full tally of all the constituent details must be revealed (at the time of birth) because each detail is the root of one function or of some condition governing one function. However the degree of power merely governs whether the function itself is carried out with greater or lesser power (e.g. with mature or immature mental powers). Accordingly the revelation (i.e. differentiation) of all the details has to come before the resultant light is (actually) revealed to the outside at birth, in order that it should be complete in all its powers. For afterwards there will be no additional revelation of any further component power. There can only be an increase in the force exerted by the existing component powers themselves. Indeed, there are different periods of time according to the order of gradation. There is a time for the details to be revealed, and when this time comes to an end, no further details can be revealed. Later there comes a period when the power of those particulars that have already been revealed is increased.
<b>...even though each contains only the minimum possible degree of radiation, the offspring is then revealed on its own...</b> As already explained, there are different degrees of power, but as soon as the offspring reaches even the first degree, once all its detailed components are present, it is revealed on its own, for it is already a complete governmental law in itself, separate from the governmental law that brought it forth.
<b>...since there is no further differentiation that the light can undergo and it can only gain added power...</b> For if there were any details to add, they could not be added now (after birth), but additions of power and radiance are possible. This is because the difference between the powers from level to level (from Partzuf to Partzuf) depends on the intensity of the lights within each one. These have the power to expand or contract in accordance with the nature and dimensions of the different vessels. However, the number of specific powers depends on the parts of the vessels themselves. (After birth, the higher powers – the parent lights – cannot add any additional parts to the vessels of the resultant offspring, but they can expand those vessels depending on their quality.)
Everything that has to be joined in as a component in the resultant light so as to be fixed as a part of the governmental order is already joined from the outset, prior to its emergence from the place where it develops (concealed within the parent power) to the outside (as a Partzuf in its own right). For once it comes forth, its unique mode of government is known as soon as it emerges, and it descends under the upper branch (the parent power that produced it), and its mode of government is not susceptible to any change or increase in terms of its constituent parts. However the actual mode of government itself can “ascend” or “descend” depending on the higher lights that enter the Partzuf itself and give it new strength.
<b>…and radiance (the mental powers that enter during the time of suckling).</b> The concept of radiance (הארה, <i>he’arah</i>) applies because according to the way the Chariot appears in prophetic vision, the resultant light is itself a radiation (הארה, <i>he’arah</i>) of light.
<b>The revelation of the offspring from the higher luminary to the outside is what is called birth.</b> This is obvious since everything follows the underlying Likeness of Man.

Chapter 67

<i>The legs of Arich Anpin sustained the broken vessels; the folding of the legs repaired and elevated them.</i>
<b>The folding of the legs of Arich Anpin was what first gave the broken vessels the power to ascend, making possible all their subsequent ascents. The truth is that the vessels were dependent upon these legs. At first they were sustained through them down below. Then, when the legs were folded up, this gave the vessels the power to return and go back up. It is in this sense that Arich Anpin (of the first Atzilut) is the root of everything. The legs were the part of Arich Anpin in which the vessels were rooted during the time of their descent. Then afterwards (as a result of the folding of the legs) they also became rooted in Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet as the extent of their repair increased.</b>
This proposition has three parts. <b>Part 1: The folding of the legs of Arich Anpin…</b> This explains the concept of the folding of the legs of Arich Anpin. <b>Part 2: The truth is…</b> How this folding causes what it causes to the vessels. <b>Part 3: It is in this sense…</b> This explains the reason why it was in Arich Anpin that this occurred.
<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE 1</small></b></sup><i class="footnote">The concept of the folding of the legs takes its meaning from the way the legs of the embryo in the womb are folded up to its chest. Kabbalistically, the legs of a Partzuf are Netzach-Hod-Yesod, while the arms and chest are Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet. The proximity of the folded legs to the arms and chest signifies how the lower levels are elevated in order to receive power from the higher levels.</i><sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE 2</small></b></sup><i class="footnote"> There is an apparent difficulty in this Opening since the folding of the legs of the Partzuf of Arich Anpin took place after the emergence of the Partzufim of Atik, Arich Anpin, Abba and Imma, as a preparation for the repair of the Partzuf of Zeir Anpin (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Zeir Anpin</i> ch. 2). Here, however, the folding of the legs of Arich Anpin is explained as a general preparation for the repair of the vessels, out of which all the Partzufim were subsequently built, including that of Arich Anpin. The intent may be that there was already a similar folding of the legs in the overall Arich Anpin or Adam Kadmon in relation to the broken vessels, which were seven Nekudot or “points” in the relative category of Zeir Anpin. Thus in the present Opening, Arich Anpin may refer to Arich Anpin of the ten Nekudim – i.e. to their Keter, which was not broken. This is the source of the upper three Sefirot of the first Atzilut, which were not broken, and which rectify Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah – including Arich Anpin, which is the Keter – of the second Atzilut.</i><b>Part 1: The folding of the legs of Arich Anpin was what first gave the broken vessels the power to ascend...</b> We see that this raising of the legs was necessary in order to lift up the vessels for the first time, and nothing further was required from Arich Anpin with respect to the vessels. It was to give the vessels the ability to ascend that this folding of the legs was necessary, and from then on, through the power gained thereby, they can rise to all the heights befitting them.  <b>...making possible all their subsequent ascents.</b> It was this action of folding the legs that initiated the ability of the vessels to ascend.
<b>Part 2: The truth is...</b> Even without taking into account that, as it goes on to say, it is the legs of Arich Anpin that sustain the vessels, we could still understand this folding of the legs as an arousal of returning light that reached these vessels. Nevertheless, the actual truth is <b>...that the vessels were dependent on these legs.</b> For you have already heard that even when they were in their fallen state down below, a certain radiation (הארה, <i>he’arah</i>) still reached them, and that is what sustained them. The radiation came to them from there (i.e. from the legs of Arich Anpin), for that is the level on which they were dependent, as explained further in Part 3. Accordingly, during the time when they required a radiation (when they were down below) it came to them from there. And likewise, when they needed to ascend, the power came from there. Accordingly, the proposition continues:
<b>At first they were sustained through them down below.</b> This is evident from the fact that with the ascent of the legs, the vessels also ascend. We thus infer that they had some dependency on those legs. We see that as long as the vessels needed to be kept below, the legs were down below and radiated to them, and when the vessels had to rise up, the legs of Arich Anpin were folded up. From this we can understand that the vessels are dependent on these legs, as stated above. When the vessels had to stay below, the legs were below and shined in them. And when the vessels had to ascend, the legs were folded and the vessels ascended after them.
<b>Then, when the legs were folded up, this gave the vessels the power to return and go back up.</b> The folding of the legs came about through the power of the arousal of the return (החזרה, <i>hachazarah</i>), and this arousal also reached the vessels that were dependent upon them, and they too ascended.
<b>Part 3: It is in this sense that Arich Anpin (of the first Atzilut) is the root of everything.</b> What relation does Arich Anpin have to the vessels? Arich Anpin is the root of everything, and these vessels must also be rooted in Arich Anpin.
<b>The legs were the part of Arich Anpin in which the vessels were rooted during the time of their descent. </b>There is nothing lower than the legs, and during the time of their descent, the vessels were rooted only in such a lowly part because of their own lowly status.
<b>Then afterwards (as a result of the folding of the legs) they also became rooted in Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet as the extent of their repair increased.</b> This was what was gained from the folding of the legs – that the vessels also became rooted in Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet of Arich Anpin, as explained in the writings of the ARI (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Zeir Anpin</i> ch. 2).

Chapter 68

<i>All parts of the creation and its laws serve the general repair</i>
<b>The parts that ascend and their various levels and ways of interconnecting are precisely what is necessary for the making of this world in the way it needed to be made, with just so many positive repairs and just so many deficiencies and laws as are necessary to bring the cycle of the governmental order to completion.</b>
<i>Having explained what was involved in the repair of the vessels that MaH sorted, selected and joined back to Himself and the ascents they make, we will now explain the law that underlies all of this, whereby all their detailed aspects must be understood.</i>
There are two parts to this proposition: <b>Part 1: The parts that ascend...</b> This gives a general introduction to this matter. <b>Part 2: ...with just so many positive repairs...</b> This explains the introduction.
<b>Part 1: The parts that ascend...</b> These are the purified portions selected for what is needed for the vessel of the Partzuf. <b>...and their various levels...</b> These are the stages of the ascent. Thus at first the vessels ascended to the place of Netzach-Hod-Yesod of Atzilut, and afterwards go up to their place little by little. And every Partzuf that went down at first to the top of Beriyah ascends from there to Atzilut, with all the other things involved in this. <b>...and ways of interconnecting...</b> i.e. such as MaH being in Atik in front while BaN is behind, whereas in Arich Anpin, MaH is right and BaN is left, and all the other things involved in this.
<b>...are precisely what is necessary...</b> For the Supreme Wisdom undoubtedly calculated exactly everything that was necessary, neither more nor less. For with just one degree higher or one degree lower, things would immediately be different. For example, if man were one level higher than his actual level, he would be like the angels, with no evil inclination, whereas if he were one level lower, he would be like an animal.
<b>...for the making of this world in the way it needed to be made...</b> In order that it should have the exact nature required in accordance with the ultimate purpose intended through it, namely to provide the possibility of free will and the return of evil to good.
<b>Part 2:</b> <b>...with just so many positive repairs and just so many deficiencies...</b> We have already explained above (Opening 50, Part 2) that the nature of the different creatures depends on degrees of closure and openness and making them as strong as necessary and as weak as necessary.
<b>...and laws as are necessary...</b> This is the mystery of the use of the repairs and deficiencies each in its necessary time and manner. <b>...to bring the cycle of the governmental order to completion.</b> The overall calculation that includes all this is the complete cycle of the governmental order. For everything is calculated in a way that can, through this cycle, reach the overall end – which is perfect goodness.

Chapter 69

<i>Balance. Cooperation between all the lights brings the complete repair.</i>
<b>The foundation of the repair lies in a balance such that all the lights must carry out their repairs taking each other in account, with just so many kinds of openness and so many kinds of closure as will collectively produce a repaired government with all the great orders that enable it to bring about one cycle of the entire creation whereby everything will end up in a state of goodness and complete perfection.</b>
<i>Having explained what happened in order to join MaH and BaN and build the worlds from them, we will now give an overall explanation of the comprehensive order that repairs these worlds.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: The state of repair consists of a balance...</b> This states the general nature of the repair. <b>Part 2: There are just as many kinds...</b> This provides further explanation.
<b>Part 1: The foundation of the repair lies in a balance...</b> This is the mystery of the Balance (מתקלא, <i>matkela</i>) mentioned by the Kabbalistic sages in connection with the mystery of Male and Female. This is what brings about the repair of the worlds.
<b>...such that all the lights must carry out their repairs taking each other in account…</b> Since the governmental order must emerge out of consensus, it is not enough for each power to be for itself alone: it must look towards its fellow powers. In addition to what each needs for its own purposes, it is also provided with what is necessary for the others so as to join with them.
<b>Part 2: …with just so many kinds of openness and so many kinds of closure...</b> As already explained, it is the different kinds of openness and closure that affect and change the mode of government in order to strengthen things or weaken them as necessary.
<b>…as will collectively produce a repaired government...</b> This is obvious, because everything that exists in the lights produces an effect among the creations in the world. The purpose of all the individual details prepared in the lights is to produce all the required effects in the governmental order that runs those creations.
<b>...with all the great orders that enable it...</b> No mind can grasp the depth of the great governmental order that the Holy One blessed be He operates, which contains things that are seemingly so strange, and yet everything leads only to repair. And the entire order depends upon these laws in all their details (i.e. upon the Partzufim, which govern the worlds).
<b>...to bring about one cycle of the entire creation...</b> It has already been explained at length that the entire governmental order is only one cycle at the end of which lies the law of general perfection.
<b>...whereby everything will end up in a state of goodness and complete perfection.</b> At the end of everything there must be only good with no further evil in existence. The cycle will be completed in such a way that everything will be fixed for good, and there will be no further destruction. All the damage will have been repaired and from then on there will be only good.

Chapter 70

<big><strong>Partzufim (Openings 70-73)</strong></big>
<i>Partzuf – a complete mode of government with 613 parts</i>
<b>A Partzuf is how a single light spreads and is revealed in all its particulars in one order in which certain parts remain interior while others are exterior, some are higher and others lower. All of them are bound together in one order so as to be joined to one another and governed by one overall governmental law, each in accordance with its own function. Altogether there are 613 parts, each of which is in turn built of a number of smaller parts as required for its complete perfection.</b>
<i>After the repair, the Sefirot were made into Partzufim, and this is what we will now discuss. The first thing that must be explained is the concept of a Partzuf.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: A Partzuf...</b> This explains under what conditions the term Partzuf is applied. <b>Part 2: Altogether there are 613...</b> This explains the lights that make up the Partzuf.
<b>Part 1: A Partzuf is how a single light spreads and is revealed in all its particulars...</b> The difference between a Sefirah and a Partzuf has already been explained above (Opening 17). Our purpose there was to explain the difference in the way they appear in the prophetic vision of the Chariot (i.e. to explain the place of each in the Chariot, which is a composite of all the modes of divine government). Now, however, it is necessary to discuss the concept of Partzuf in more detail in order to provide the necessary foundation to understand the governmental order later on. As stated above, a Partzuf is one of the powers (i.e. Sefirot) that becomes differentiated into its constituent parts and conditions in a revealed way.
<b>...in one order...</b> This is the order or organizational basis governing the arrangement of all of the individual details that make up the Likeness of Man, as discussed earlier (Opening 12).
<b>...in which certain parts remain interior while others are exterior...</b> In terms of the Likeness of Man, a fundamental distinction must be made between the interior and the exterior – i.e. the internal and external parts. Included here is the concept of the soul and the body. In the body there are three vessels: internal, external and intermediary. Moreover, we distinguish between the body and its garments, and likewise between inner light and encompassing light and all the other aspects discussed in the Kabbalistic writings in connection with the various states of the different levels, one within the other. This is called the “measure of the thickness” (עובי, <i>ovi</i>) or “breadth”. What is understood by this is the way things are clothed one within another (e.g. Chochmah-Binah-Daat within Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet, which are within Netzach-Hod-Yesod).
Another fundamental distinction is between the head or start and the end, and between upper and lower, as the proposition goes on to say:
<b>...some are higher and others lower.</b> Things can be higher or lower in terms of their proximity to the root or the extent to which they spread in relation to the lower world. This is the “measure of the height” (שיעור הקומה, <i>shiur hakomah</i>): every upper level has a higher function than the level below it. These concepts enable us to understand the developmental sequence governing the emergence of the Partzufim and also how the lights are connected with one another.
<b>All of them are bound together in one order...</b> i.e. in that same particular form or likeness, namely the Likeness of Man. Through this we can understood the way the levels are linked to one another and likewise how they depend on one another through the principle of mechanical interaction (כונניות, <i>koneniyut</i>, “like a clock whose wheels meet and one small wheel moves many great wheels” – <i>Daat Tevunot</i> p. 101). Various other Kabbalistic concepts also relate to the way the different levels join together and interact.
<b>...so as to be joined to one another...</b> Each part is joined with another to work in combination as required by the governmental order. Thus the different levels join together to rule in such a way that when one level is aroused, the level connected with it is also aroused. In addition, there is a spirit (רוח, <i>ruach</i>) that goes around through the whole body (see above, Opening 34 Part 2).
<b>...and governed by one overall governmental law...</b> This is the “heart” (i.e. Tiferet, the center) which, through its blood and through the spirit (רוח, <i>ruach</i>) within it, governs all the different limbs and organs in accordance with their individual nature. This is how the government of the entire Partzuf emerges from the root, which is the connective bond of the Partzuf through the mystery of the “understanding heart”. This is a particular facet that stands for this purpose, whereby Binah, Tiferet and Malchut are joined together, and from there the government emerges in its full depth and truth.
<b>...each in accordance with its own function.</b> Each part or limb of the Partzuf is governed by the “heart” in accordance with the nature and function of the part in question. This is obvious, because this overall law is literally like the heart, which governs all the limbs.
<b>Part 2: Altogether there are 613 parts...</b> To be a Partzuf, the Sefirah must be differentiated into its particular details. But the truth is that the total number of details is 613. This number is integral to the mystery of the Likeness of Man, for the Supreme Mind calculated that this was what was necessary in order to give the world the required character.
<b>...each of which is in turn built of a number of smaller parts...</b> This is also integral to the mystery of the Likeness of Man: each part is built of numerous small details. <b>...as required for its complete perfection.</b> This was also part of the calculation made by the Supreme Mind in order to lead to complete perfection.

Chapter 71

<i>Complete correspondence between the arrangement of the Partzuf and the human form</i>
<b>The arrangement of the lights of the Partzuf, their interconnections and all their different aspects are exactly like the order of the limbs and organs of man’s body. Everything that exists in man has some corresponding aspect in the lights that make up the Partzufim above.</b>
<i>Having explained that the Partzufim are rooted in the mystery of the Likeness of Man, we will now elaborate further on the correspondence between the Partzufim and the human form.</i><br> <i>“And in truth, the physical human form is the offspring of all the Sefirot together... and shows everything that can be understood about Godliness” (</i>Daat Tevunot<i> p. 329).</i>
This proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: The arrangement of the lights of the Partzuf...</b> This expresses the complete correspondence between the Partzufim and the human form. <b>Part 2: Everything that exists in man...</b> This is the mystery of “And from my flesh I perceive God” (Job 19:26).
<b>Part 1: The arrangement of the lights of the Partzuf...</b> This arrangement consists of everything discussed in the previous Opening in connection with the measures of “thickness” or “breadth” and “height”. <b>...their interconnections...</b> This includes everything discussed there about how they are bound and joined together. <b>...and all their different aspects are exactly like the order of the limbs and organs of man’s body.</b>
In other words, anything that can be said about the nature of man, such as all the different aspects of constitution and character (מזגים, <i>mezagim</i>, “mixes” of elements) – in short, everything discernible in the human form in all the affairs of this world – is all rooted above. The underlying foundation of what we see in the world lies in all the different aspects of the flow (שפע, <i>shefa</i>) emanating from the lights, which sustains all the different aspects of human service in this world, governing the indwelling of higher levels within lower levels and all the other characteristics of the lights. All that can be said about the supreme Partzufim follows the corresponding aspects in the human form.
<b>Part 2: Everything that exists in man has some corresponding aspect in the lights...</b> This is the mystery of “And from my flesh I perceive God” (Job 19:26). For this is the way to investigate and discover what exists in the Sefirot – through the creations in the lower world, just as what exists in the lower creations can be known through the Sefirot. Indeed, what falls under our scrutiny initially is that which exists in the lower creations. It is necessary to rise up to the source, to understand things properly in the light of the link that joins the lower world with the upper world, namely the link between the resultant effect and its cause. <b>...that make up the Partzufim above.</b> i.e. it is in the Partzufim that we find this differentiation into particulars and not in the Sefirot.

Chapter 72

<i>The Partzufim: male and female, and the differences between them</i>
<b>Some of the Partzufim are male and some are female. That is, some of them channel Kindness and some Judgment. Through their coupling, the flows are joined together, giving birth to the necessary action. For there is nothing that does not have the agreement of the two qualities of Kindness and Judgment. And there are certain differences in the lights of the male and female as well as a real difference in their law of operation. But as regards any difference in form – any real difference – this is found only in the lights that are involved in the channeling, namely the Yesods, for these are the ones that perform the channeling, and all the different parts of the Partzuf are drawn to them to flow forth in accordance with their law.</b>
<i>Having discussed the Partzufim and what they have in common, we must now explain in what respect they differ from one another.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: Some of the Partzufim...</b> This states in general terms in what respect the Partzufim differ from one another. <b>Part 2: And there are certain differences...</b> This explains where this difference lies.
<b>Part 1: Some of the Partzufim are male and some are female.</b> This is obvious, because the intention follows the principle of Balance (<i>matkela</i>, מתקלא) – to repair everything through the mystery of male and female, as discussed earlier (Opening 65).
<b>That is, some of them channel...</b> For as you have already heard, the function of the Partzufim is to channel the light that originates from Eyn Sof, blessed be He, so that it should be drawn down continually through a chain of cause and effect.
<b>…Kindness and some Judgment.</b> This has already been explained in connection with the mystery of MaH and BaN. The principle that underlies the flow of influence (השפעה, <i>hashpa’ah</i>) is that this flow must be a combination of Kindness and Judgment. There are three reasons for this. The first is that there has to be reward and punishment. The second reason is that the actual flow of sustenance (שפע, <i>shefa</i>) that needs to enter the world on all sides must come with the agreement of these two qualities. Where necessary, Judgment will agree with Kindness, and where necessary, the reverse. This way the government in its entirety extends to all that exists. Any place where it is proper to give sway to the influence of Kindness is within the reach of the influence of Kindness, while any place where it is necessary to give sway to Judgment is within the reach of the power of Judgment. However, both Kindness and Judgment are required to supervise all the details so that in a place where it is necessary to strengthen the one or the other, they will see to it that they do so, whereas in a place where they must agree, they will see to it that they agree.
The third reason why the flow of influence must be a combination of Kindness and Judgment is that the creations themselves include some that emerge from, display and reveal the root of Kindness while others derive from and allude to the side of Judgment. Both must exist continually. Even in a single creature, there are aspects that stem from the side of Kindness and aspects that stem from the side of Judgment. The same applies to MaH and BaN, as discussed earlier. Every creation must be a combination of these two factors, and each root must influence and sustain its offshoot.
<b>Through their coupling, the flows are joined together...</b> The purpose of coupling is so that the resultant influences should not emerge from two places in two different directions. Rather, the resultant influence will already be a combination of all these factors and will divide up afterwards down below to reach the necessary places.
<b>...giving birth to the necessary action.</b> After the combining of the influences is complete, the action goes forth. The reason is that there is no action whatever that will not include a share of both Kindness and Judgment, and therefore the action is only born out of these two influences after they have already been joined together.
<b>For there is nothing that does not have the agreement of the two qualities of Kindness and Judgment.</b> It is impossible to conceive of anything, however small, that is not a combination of these two. That is why every action requires all this in order to be able to come into being.
<b>Part 2: And there are certain differences in the lights of the male and female... </b>This is obvious, because the lights produce their effect according to their function, and if the effects are different we may infer that there is a difference in the lights – one is the light of Kindness while the other is the light of Judgment.
<b>...as well as a real difference in their law of operation.</b> The difference is not necessarily in the form of the lights but in their character. This is plainly visible in the human form: there are innate differences between males and females in aspects such as voice, appearance, physical strength and so on. The root of all this must lie above.
<b>But as regards any difference in form...</b> As stated above, the difference is not in the form of the lights but rather in their character. On the contrary, they are equal inasmuch as they share the same overall form of the species. However, in their specific individual form there will certainly be a difference, except that it is a difference that is not tangible (e.g. the softer lines of the female face), as stated above.
<b>…any real difference…</b> we are not talking about a quantitive difference, one of more or less, but rather about a substantive difference. The only such difference is in their Yesods, as the proposition goes on to state.
<b>...this is found only in the lights that are involved in the channeling...</b> For each light functions according to its purpose, and its form is suited to its required function. The function changes according to the change in the form in which that function is rooted. Since different influences have to be drawn down, the lights involved in the channeling of the influence have to be different, which is why it is in their nature to draw down a different influence.
<b>...namely the Yesods...</b> In the human form it is obvious that there is a genuine and complete difference between the organs of reproduction of the male and female. This shows that it is here that the root of the difference lies, because aside from this, both male and female consist of 613 parts and other shared aspects. Where they differ is in the way they draw down their influence. The truth is that there is a difference between male and female in everything relating to the Yesod. The proof case is that of the castrate (who has no beard, etc. – a change in form that depends on the Yesod).
<b>...for these are the ones that perform the channeling...</b> This is obvious, for the function of the Yesod is only as “a river coming out from Eden” (Genesis 2:10) – drawing the influence to the necessary place.
<b>...and all the different parts of the Partzuf are drawn to them to flow forth in accordance with their law.</b> For the Yesods are aroused first, and they draw forth influence from all the different parts of the Partzuf commensurate with their arousal. The other limbs draw down influence from Eyn Sof, until everything is drawn down to the Yesod, as will be discussed later in its appropriate place. All this is clearly visible in the human form. And since the entire channeling of influence depends upon the Yesods and the other limbs are subject to them in this respect, it is sufficient for the difference to be in the Yesods in order to bring about the necessary difference in the government.

Chapter 73

<i>Different degrees of connection of male and female in different Partzufim</i>
<b>The connection of the male and female aspects constitutes perfection, and this is how the influence is channeled. Accordingly, wherever the male and female are closer together in and of themselves, this indicates a level of perfection that requires no work on the part of the lower creations. The further apart they become from one another, the more it indicates a want of perfection and that work is needed there on the part of the lower creations.</b>
<i>Having explained the overall difference between the male and female Partzufim, we must now explain the difference between one male and another and between one female and another.</i>
There are two parts to this proposition: <b>Part 1: The connection...</b> When the male and female aspects are connected, this is perfection. <b>Part 2: Accordingly...</b> It is in the degree of the connection that there are differences.
<b>Part 1: The connection of the male and female aspects constitutes perfection...</b> This is clearly so, because male and female are the mystery of Kindness and Judgment, and the connection between them brings sweetening since Kindness sweetens the strict judgments. Moreover, the female is the receiver (מקבל, <i>mekabel</i>) while the male is the active influence (משפיע, <i>mashpia</i>). The entire function of evil is only to separate the receiver from the source of influence. From this you may infer the converse – that when male and female are joined, it is because evil is powerless to distance the receiver from the source of influence. It follows that the connection of male and female is perfection.
<b>...and this is how the influence is channeled.</b> It is through their coupling that the influence is drawn down, and accordingly, wherever the coupling is greater, the flow of influence is greater.
<b>Part 2: Accordingly, wherever the male and female are closer together in and of themselves, this indicates a level of perfection...</b> In the light of what we have said, this should be obvious, for the whole purpose of men’s service is to bring about the coupling of the male and female aspects in order to conciliate and sweeten the attribute of Judgment and enable the recipient to be attached to its source of influence. When this is already intrinsically the case (because on such a high level there is no evil and therefore no need to conciliate and sweeten the attribute of Judgment) it follows that there is no need for work on the part of man. This is a level of perfection <b>...that requires no work on the part of the lower creations.</b>
<b>The further apart they become from one another...</b> The distance between them increases gradually, level by level. In the Partzuf of Atik there is a great connection, with male and female both everywhere in the Partzuf. In the case of Arich Anpin, the male is on the right and the female on the left, but still in one Partzuf. Abba and Imma are male and female and are two Partzufim, yet they emerge as one and dwell as one. Zeir and Nukva are two separate Partzufim, and also their coupling is not continuous. Thus man’s main service lies in bringing about the union of Tiferet and Malchut, respectively Zeir Anpin and the Nukva. Accordingly, the further apart they are from one another <b>...the more it indicates a want of perfection and that work is needed there on the part of the lower creations.</b>

Chapter 74

<big><strong>The Partzuf of Atik (Openings 74-77)</strong></big>
<i>Atik – Malchut of Adam Kadmon – is clothed in and governs Atzilut.</i>
<b>Atik is the first Partzuf attributed to Atzilut. Atik is Malchut of Adam Kadmon, which extends with the repairs required for this and clothes itself in Atzilut in order to bind it with Adam Kadmon and to sustain it and govern it.</b>
<i>Until now we have been discussing the Partzufim in general. We will now begin to explain what the Partzufim are individually.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: Atik is the first...</b> This comes to explain that Atik is the first Partzuf. <b>Part 2: Atik is Malchut...</b> This explains its function.
<b>Part 1: Atik is the first Partzuf attributed to Atzilut...</b> In other words, it is one of the Sefirot of Adam Kadmon, as the proposition goes on to state, yet it is considered to relate to Atzilut.
<b>Part 2: Atik is Malchut of Adam Kadmon...</b> As already explained (see Opening 70), every Sefirah that rules on its own is called a Partzuf in its own right. Since Malchut of Adam Kadmon has a function of its own – namely, to govern Atzilut – it is therefore called a Partzuf.
<b>...which extends with the repairs required for this...</b> For in one place the Kabbalistic teachings state that Atik was made from MaH and BaN (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Atik</i>  ch. 1). Elsewhere, however, it appears that Atik is Malchut of Adam Kadmon (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Seder Atzilut</i> ch. 1) – and it cannot be said that Adam Kadmon was constructed of MaH and BaN. The explanation is that in order to govern Atzilut, it was necessary for Malchut of Adam Kadmon to take on these aspects (i.e. of MaH and BaN), and they are its repairs, for it is with this power that Malchut of Adam Kadmon governs Atzilut.
<b>...and clothes itself in Atzilut...</b> i.e. in Arich Anpin of Atzilut, which includes the entire world. <b>...in order to bind it with Adam Kadmon...</b>  This is clearly so, because the governmental bond requires the branch to be bound up with the root in order to receive maintenance and direction. Accordingly, the proposition continues: <b>...and to sustain it...</b> i.e. the existence of the branch depends on the root.<b> ...and govern it...</b> The higher level governs the lower, and the latter is the effect of the former.

Chapter 75

<i>Atik’s male and female aspects are literally one body.</i>
<b>The Partzuf of Atik is built of MaH and BaN, and they are its male and female aspects, standing literally in one joint entity like one body, such that it is impossible to assign them a place and call this one right and the other left. Rather, they are joined together in literally one entity made out of both of them into one body.</b>
<i>Having discussed Atik in general terms, we will now go into greater detail, starting with how Atik is constructed.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The Partzuf of Atik...</b> This explains the male and female aspects of Atik. <b>Part 2: ...standing...</b> This explains how they are arranged.
<b>Part 1: The Partzuf of Atik...</b> As stated in the previous opening, in order for Malchut of Adam Kadmon to become a Partzuf, it had to extend and unfold so as to manifest certain specific repairs. These particular repairs consist of the aspects of MaH and BaN that are joined together therein.
<b>...is built of MaH and BaN, and they are its male and female aspects...</b> You see already that the male aspects always derive from MaH while the female aspects derive from BaN. However, where the male and female aspects are separate from one another (as in the case of the lower Partzufim, which are either male or female), each receives the opposite aspect from the other and this is why we discern MaH and BaN in both of them. (Even though BaN is found also in the male Partzuf and MaH in the female, this is because the male received the BaN from the female and vice versa.) Here, however, on the level of Atik, where both male and female stand together, there is no need for this. On the contrary, they divide up in the Partzuf itself – MaH as the male and BaN as the female.
<b>Part 2: ...standing literally in one entity...</b> In other words, on this level the power of perfection is so great that the male and female aspects stand without any break between them. <b>...like one body...</b> They are considered merely as two aspects combined in one body. <b>...such that it is impossible to assign them a place and call this one right and the other left.</b> Herein lies the superiority of Atik over Arich Anpin, where the male and female aspects are also in one body. However, in Arich Anpin they are respectively to the right and the left, whereas in Atik one is the front and the other is the back. In one way this may not appear superior at all, but the point is that in Arich Anpin each has its own place, one on the right side and the other on the left, whereas in Atik both of them are on both sides, right and left.
<b>Rather, they are joined together in literally one joint entity made out of both of them into one body.</b> It might appear as if calling one the front and the other the back is a spatial description, but the truth is that they are not front and back in the same sense as we will be using these terms later. Rather they are literally like two simple entities which, through being combined, become one body made of both of them. Both are compounded together in every place with no way of separating them. We can only say in general terms that in every place where the female is found, it is considered the back of wherever it is. (In other words, in every part of Atik there are male and female aspects, and in relative terms the female is “behind” in relation to the male. The female thus has no specific place, which is not so in the case of Arich Anpin, where the female is on the left.)

Chapter 76

<i>The “back” in Atik: The face of BaN is the back of the face of MaH.</i>
<b>The phenomenon of the backpart, where the lights are darkened and do not radiate, is also not seen in Atik, for all of Atik shows a face on every side. The aspect of the back is absorbed within the aspect of the face that holds sway there. Except that there is a face because of MaH and a face because of BaN, and the face of BaN is considered like the back of that of MaH.</b>
<i>Following our general discussion of Atik, we must now explain one more detail that must be understood in connection with its male and female aspects.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The phenomenon of the backpart...</b> Atik has no actual “back”. <b>Part 2: Except that there is a face...</b> Nevertheless, there is an aspect of “back”.
<b>Part 1: The phenomenon of the backpart, where the lights are darkened...</b> This too can be understood by considering the human form, which has a front – the “face” – facing and directed towards others, and a back, which is turned away and cannot be used to face anything. Similarly, the lights have an aspect through which they intentionally direct and set themselves on course in a particular direction, while other aspects are inferior to the “face” inasmuch as they lack this radiation and are subordinate to the main lights. Viewing the face, one finds a strong radiation powerfully directed towards the spectator, while looking at the backpart is like standing behind a person’s shoulders.
<b>...and do not radiate...</b> This darkness is not caused by any flaw: this is how it is by nature. For there are two levels in viewing the light: viewing its primary location, or looking somewhere less essential, where the radiation is less complete because that place is not recognizable as a “face” directed towards the onlooker.
<b>...is also not seen in Atik...</b> This indicates that there is no Judgment there at all. For the concept of the backpart (אחוריים, <i>achorayim</i>) indicates removal and departure, in the sense that the lights are not directed downwards to the lower realm. Atik, however, which is the root of the complete and perfect governmental order, as will be discussed below, is all complete mercy, showing the face of sweetness on every side. Thus the proposition goes on to say:
<b>...for all of Atik shows a face on every side.</b>
<b>The aspect of the back is absorbed within the aspect of the face that holds sway there.</b> This answers an apparent difficulty. For we are saying that the face of MaH is to the front of Atik while the face of BaN is behind, and this may appear similar to the state of “back-to-back” in Zeir and Nukva, where, on the contrary, this is a deficiency, and they cannot couple unless they come face to face. Yet here we are presenting this as an advantage. This difficulty is resolved when we understand that the relationship between the male and female aspects in Atik is not the same as in the case of Zeir and Nukva. In the case of the latter, there is indeed a backpart, and it is in order to protect the “back” from the husks (קליפות, <i>kelipot</i>) that the back is concealed within through the “back-to-back” state of the Partzufim. However, in the case of Atik the phenomenon of the backpart does not exist. No back is revealed because of the great power of the face.
Two things are thereby resolved. Firstly, the male and female aspects in Atik are not “back-to-back” as in the case of Zeir and Nukva, because here, on the level of Atik, there is no backpart. Secondly, they are able to couple together, for the state of Atik is called “face-to-face” since there is only a face on every side. For the category of the backpart does not exist there at all but is absorbed within the lights of the face. (There is not the negative aspect of back-to-back required when two Partzufim must protect their back parts from the husks precisely because the two lack unity; the fact that Atik is a single Partzuf that is all face shows the perfection of Atik, and there is no higher level of coupling and partnership than this.)
<b>Part 2: Except that there is a face because of MaH and a face because of BaN...</b> Clearly, since they are two lights, they have two kinds of face. <b>...and the face of BaN is considered like the back of that of MaH.</b> This is because they shine less than the face of MaH and they are slightly tilted because of the root of Judgment. Nevertheless, they are not actual “back”, for they too look forth and shine to one who looks there.

Chapter 77

<i>Coupling in Atik</i>
<b>The connection of these male and female aspects of Atik is literally like two powers joined together within one body.</b>
<i>This explains the concept of the “coupling” of Atik and his female aspect, since they are literally like one body.</i>
<b>The connection of these male and female aspects of Atik...</b> We have already stated that coupling takes place wherever male and female are found, and it is necessary to understand what this means in the case of the male and female aspects of Atik, which are in one compound.
<b>... is literally like two powers joined together within one body.</b> In other words, their joining with one another is what completes that body. (This very joining is their “coupling”, for coupling means acting in partnership.)

Chapter 78

<big><strong>The Root of the Concealed Government (Openings 78-84)</strong></big>
<i>A trace of all faulty deeds remains, even after their repair, in order to reveal perfection.</i>
<b>The consequences of each and every deed ever performed remain in existence even though the deed is already in the past. Thus, when a flaw has been repaired, the trace of the flaw does not disappear, but rather it is registered as a flaw that received its repair. And the reverse also applies. This is because nothing is forgotten before His throne of glory. And at the end of the entire cycle there will be a complete repair taking into account everything that was done, whether good or bad. </b>
<i>Having discussed the Partzuf of Atik in general terms, we must now examine Atik’s function in the overall government and the way Atik is ordered accordingly. We must begin by explaining some fundamental aspects of the government that require all these orders of Atik.</i>
There are two parts to this proposition. <b>Part 1: The consequences...</b> This explains the principle that all deeds leave their mark above. <b>Part 2: And at the end...</b> This explains what is gained through this mark left by all deeds.
<b>Part 1: The consequences of each and every deed ever performed remain in existence even though the deed is already in the past.</b> This means that every action adds either a flaw or a repair to the overall governmental order, and the action that comes after it is judged in accordance with what went before it. For there is no comparison between a flaw that comes after a repair and a repair that comes after a flaw, or between a flaw that comes after a flaw that has been repaired, or a repair that comes after a repair that became flawed. There are unending possibilities.
<b>Thus, when a flaw has been repaired, the trace of the flaw does not disappear...</b> Everything that is done below is registered above in order that the judgment that is passed afterwards will take account of what happened previously. <b>...but rather, it is registered as a flaw that received its repair. And the reverse also applies.</b> In other words, each thing is registered in its uniqueness with all that distinguishes it from everything else – after how many other repairs and how many flaws it came, and all the other individual details that can be discerned in it.
<b>This is because nothing is forgotten before His throne of glory.</b> Needless to say, there is no forgetfulness before God, since forgetfulness is a contingency of the physical body. What is meant here is that the governmental order is made in such a way that when judging a given deed, the entire past is examined and taken into account.
<b>Part 2: And at the end of the entire cycle...</b> The gain that comes from the way everything leaves its mark above is because all that happens is part of the cycle of the wheel that continues turning until the end in order to show the subsequent perfection through the very power of the deficiencies that existed in the past. If so, everything must be revealed as one in order for the perfection to rectify everything, and then this truth will be understood properly.
<b>...there will be a complete repair...</b> This is obvious since, as I have said, the overall perfection will bring about the complete repair of all the defects that existed in the past.
<b>...taking into account everything that was done...</b> i.e. during the time of the cycle of the wheel, because the purpose of the cycle was to reach this final rest.
<b>...whether good or bad.</b> Through examining things in their unique particularity, all the different aspects of the rule of concealment – the Residue – will be understood. Thus in the future it will be understood how the Residue was coming ever closer to repair even when it appeared that faulty deeds were making everything go backwards. It will then be seen how the Line continued to sustain the world throughout the time of the rule of concealment in order not to let it reach the point of actual destruction, and how it engineered the cycle in such a way as to reach that state of rest in the end, as will be discussed further below.

Chapter 79

<i>The Great Day of Judgment: complete repair and receiving the reward</i>
<b>The Great Day of Judgment is when all the deeds of the world will be laid out in their proper order, just as they were performed, from the beginning of the world until its end. In the light of all of this, perfection will reign through the revelation of the knowledge of His unity, blessed be His name. In accordance with the perfection that will then reign, the eternal reward will be established for ever and ever and to all eternity, endlessly and without limits.</b>
<i>Having discussed how all deeds leave their mark and how this serves to reveal God’s perfection through all that exists, we must now explain how and when this revelation will come about.</i>
The proposition has two parts.
<b>Part 1: The Great Day of Judgment...</b> This is the day when God is destined to judge all His works. The purpose of this will be to lay out His entire Judgment from the beginning of the governmental order until the end, to prove to man the righteousness of His laws. Thus the proposition states that this Day of Judgment <b>...is when all the deeds of the world will be laid out in their proper order, just as they were performed...</b> In other words, to ascertain the true nature and significance of things as they really are, it is not sufficient for them to be judged according to what they are in themselves. Everything that came before them must also be taken into account. <b>...from the beginning of the world until its end.</b> This is why the Great Day of Judgment comes at the end, when all the deeds will have been done, in order to include everything in it.
<b>Part 2: In the light of all this, perfection will reign...</b> i.e. the repair of all the deficiencies, as explained earlier. <b>...through the revelation of the knowledge of His unity, blessed be His name.</b> In other words, as explained above, this revelation of unity shows that the power and control are His alone.
<b>In accordance with the perfection that will then reign, the eternal reward will be established for ever and ever and to all eternity, endlessly and without limits.</b> There is another benefit in the Great Judgment, and this stems from what we have already explained – that through the revelation of the unity, the eternal reward will be determined for all who served. Each one’s delight in the Supreme Perfection will be commensurate with his service in revealing the unity.

Chapter 80

<i>BaN and MaH are the root of all defects and repairs.</i>
<b>All the different kinds of defects that could possibly exist were rooted in BaN. And all the different kinds of repairs for all of these defects are rooted in the interconnections whereby MaH joins with BaN. Accordingly, everything that was and will be was already rooted here, and this is through the mystery of God’s foreknowledge. And ultimately it will be understood how all this was necessary in order to complete the overall perfection through the mystery of His unity.</b>
<i>Having discussed how the Great Judgment will be a full reckoning of the defects and repairs, we must now provide further explanation of the overall root involved in all this.</i>
This proposition contains two parts. <b>Part 1: All the different kinds...</b> This states a premise about the root of the defects and their repairs. <b>Part 2: Accordingly...</b> This explains the corollary of the above premise.
<b>Part 1: All the different kinds of defects that could possibly exist...</b> Clearly, all the different processes on the level of the Sefirot are nothing but ready-made pathways, whether for good or for the opposite, heaven forbid, in order to provide a place for man’s service of God through having the freedom to do either good or bad. <b>...were rooted in BaN. And all the different kinds of repairs for all these defects are rooted in the interconnections whereby MaH joins with BaN.</b> For the different pathways with which MaH is interconnected with BaN are precisely the pathways required in order to repair these defects.
<b>Part 2: Accordingly, everything that was and will be was already rooted here...</b> For ready prepared here is everything that can possibly exist throughout all of time depending on man’s deeds. <b>...and this is through the mystery of God’s foreknowledge.</b> For God foresaw all that was destined to be (“He foresaw the deeds of the righteous...” – Bereishit Rabbah 3:8), and accordingly He prepared here the repairs that would suffice for all that was destined to be.
<b>And ultimately it will be understood how all this was necessary in order to complete the overall perfection...</b> After the deficiencies have become known – how many there are and how far they reach – the need for all the different pathways of repair prepared here will then be understood in retrospect. At the outset, however, this could not be known except to God, Who in His supreme knowledge knew everything.
<b>...through the mystery of His unity.</b> All that relates to the repair of the deficiencies comes to complete the revelation of God’s overall perfection. For in proportion to the deficiencies, so is the perfection that is revealed when the necessary repair is brought about through the mystery of the revelation of the supreme unity.

Chapter 81

<i>The concealed governmental order – the root of free will. The revealed governmental order – the Partzufim of Atzilut.</i>
<b>The joining of MaH and BaN through these interconnections is the true root of the entire governmental order. However, it is impossible for this root to be revealed. Quite the contrary, the entire government depends on the concealment of this root. For then men act on their level in accordance with their freedom of choice while the Holy One, blessed be He, carries out His plan. For the concealment itself is what brings about the repair. Accordingly, there is on the one hand the order whose function the Holy One, blessed be He, displays: this is the order of Atzilut with its various Partzufim. On the other hand, there is the concealed root which lies in the way MaH is joined with BaN, and this is not known.</b>
<i>Further to our discussion of the interconnections between MaH and BaN, let us now examine how they are arranged.</i>
There are two parts to this proposition. <b>Part 1: The joining...</b> This is a premise relating to the connection of MaH and BaN. <b>Part 2: Accordingly...</b> This is the corollary of the above premise.
<b>Part 1: The joining of MaH and BaN through these interconnections...</b> If MaH and BaN were merely linked directly, each Sefirah of the one being joined with the corresponding Sefirah of the other, Keter with Keter, Chochmah with Chochmah etc. on every level of the interior and encompassing lights and all the vessels, interior and exterior in both cases, then all we would need to understand about this matter is that every level has to be a composite of MaH and BaN. However, this is not the way they are connected. For while the Partzufim of Atzilut are all a composite of MaH and BaN, the respective Sefirot of MaH and BaN in each case are not parallel to one another. Rather, there is a unique arrangement – as is evident from the order in which the Partzufim were sorted and purified – that governs the way MaH and BaN are combined in each of the different Partzufim. The fact that there is a unique arrangement shows that there is a particular purpose here which goes beyond what we would have expected had the connection been direct.
In the light of this we must understand the Partzufim of Atzilut, their arrangement and the way they rule, as a single Tree that constitutes a complete order of government as required for the creations. However, prior to all of Atzilut there is this connection of MaH and BaN. (“The coupling of Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon” – <i>Etz Chayim Shaar</i> 3 ch. 2. This may refer to the connection between the Line and the Residue, which is the root of all that is destined to exist.) For the Partzufim were produced in accordance with the way that MaH and BaN interconnect. We must therefore say that first there must exist this root of the governmental order which arranges these interconnections, and only afterwards the governmental order itself comes forth through the Partzufim.
Thus the connection of MaH with BaN <b>...is the true root of the entire governmental order.</b> However, the truth is that this root order is not known to us: only the order of the Partzufim which emerges from this root is known to us. We may thus infer that the order of Atzilut is the order which the Supreme Will wanted to reveal to us, but this very order itself is very deeply rooted in its own root, which He does not want to reveal to us. <b>...the true root...</b> Even though it does not seem so, this is really the true root, because while we only see the government emerging from the Partzufim of Atzilut, we know that its root lies here.
<b>However, it is impossible for this root to be revealed.</b> There is a reason why the governmental order requires that the one should be revealed and the other should not be revealed. <b>Quite the contrary, the entire government depends on the concealment of this root.</b> This root is the level of God’s foreknowledge, where all that was to be afterwards – the defects, deriving from BaN, and all the repairs for all these defects, deriving from MaH – were already revealed. On the other hand, the entire service of man depends upon this supreme knowledge being concealed from them. For if they had this knowledge, they would have no free will and there would be no service and no reward or punishment. Since the intention of the governmental order is to provide a place for man’s service and for reward and punishment, it was necessary for this root to be concealed.
<b>For then men act on their level in accordance with their freedom of choice...</b> Since foreknowledge of what is going to happen is withheld from people, if they do something and succeed, they are not aware that what they were going to accomplish was already known. On the other hand, if they make an effort to do something without being able to accomplish it, they still receive a good reward for their effort, whereas had they known they were not going to succeed, they would not have made the effort. And so on.
<b>...while the Holy One, blessed be He, carries out His plan.</b> In other words, ultimately the truth is that what God with His foreknowledge knew is going to happen is what happens. <b>For the concealment itself is what brings about the repair.</b> Through the cycle whereby evil reverts to good, it is revealed that the purpose of the concealment was for the sake of the repair – in order to bring about the possibility of free will.
<b>Part 2: Accordingly, there is on the one hand the order whose function the Holy One, blessed be He, displays...</b> For out of this first hidden root of the governmental order come the Partzufim, which make up a single visible order. However, we always know that every aspect that we see in this revealed order has a root and a cause that lies in the concealed root, which exists to bring about the possibility of man’s service, and this root we cannot know. Thus on the one hand there is the revealed order: <b>...this is the order of Atzilut with its various Partzufim. On the other hand, there is the concealed root which lies in the way MaH is joined with BaN, and this is not known.</b>

Chapter 82

<i>The role of different souls in the overall repair: variations in the fortunes of the righteous are rooted in the hidden connection of MaH and BaN.</i>
<b>The repair allotted as the task of each individual soul stems from the way this interconnection of MaH and BaN is arranged, and this is the root cause of why in some cases the righteous enjoy a good life while in other cases they suffer. From the way the souls are rooted in the Partzufim of Atzilut there appears to be no valid reason for this. But the truth is that the root of this mystery lies in this hidden connection.</b>
<i>Further to our explanation of this concealed root, we will now discuss the way it affects the governmental order.</i>
<b>The repair allotted as the task of each individual soul...</b> The Supreme Mind did not create more souls than were necessary for the task, for He calculated everything – the human form as the key to the way man’s service and the commandments of the Torah are ordered, and the human form as the key to the way the souls are ordered. Thus each soul has its own root repair to carry out, and this contributes to the successive repair of all aspects of existence according to what is allotted to that soul.
<b>...stems from the way this interconnection of MaH and BaN is arranged...</b> For the souls are rooted in these levels that we have been discussing (“the Yechidah is from Adam Kadmon” – <i>Shaarey Kedushah</i> 3:2), and it is from there that they receive their mission, each according to its particular root. If this is the level where the souls are rooted, it is because the entire governmental order operates first and foremost through and for the souls, and from them it extends to all the different creations and all the worlds. (The entire creation serves man, and therefore the creation is arranged according to the service required of the souls.)
<b>...and this is the root cause of why in some cases the righteous enjoy a good life while in other cases they suffer.</b> On that level there is a logically necessary reason why one righteous individual may have a good life while another suffers. This is the concept of “the fortune (מזל, <i>mazal</i>) of the hour” that affects people’s destiny, for this depends on the individual root of the soul but not its individual root in Atzilut. (The Mazal – the soul’s share in the overall service – depends upon the interconnections of MaH and BaN that are rooted in the Unknown Head, but not upon Atzilut, where the service is founded on the principle of merit, reward and punishment.)
<b>From the way the souls are rooted in the Partzufim of Atzilut...</b> For just as there are two orders of government – the concealed order rooted in the Unknown Head and the revealed order of Atzilut – so the souls are rooted in both of them. Initially they were rooted in the hidden level, and afterwards they enter and take root in the revealed order of Atzilut.
<b>...there appears to be no valid reason for this...</b> This was why Moses had difficulty with the suffering of the righteous, and moreover the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him: “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious” (Exodus 33:19) – even though he may not be worthy (see <i>Berachot</i> 7a). For according to the root of the soul in Atzilut they did not deserve this lot. <b>But the truth is that the root of this mystery lies in this hidden connection.</b>

Chapter 83

<i>The parts of MaH and BaN from which the Partzufim were made are not discernible in the governmental order.</i>
<b>The Partzufim of Atzilut were made through the process of sorting and selection of the parts of the broken vessels. However, what they are made from is now no longer recognizable because the selected parts are already joined together, making the Partzufim equal – those made from certain selected portions being similar to those made from other selected portions.</b>
<b>The Partzufim of Atzilut were made through the process of sorting and selection of the parts of the broken vessels.</b> If there were any discernible difference between one Partzuf and another because of the parts of MaH and BaN selected for their construction in each case, then despite the concealment of the governmental order of MaH and BaN for the sake of free will (see Opening 81), its functioning would still be recognizable as a result. However, no such difference can be discerned, because what was – was (the selection has already been made) and Atzilut is one single order in which every aspect instituted as a Partzuf comes and governs. With respect to this order, there is no distinction at all between the different Partzufim except in terms of which incline towards Kindness or Judgment etc. but not in terms of the selected parts from which they were made in each case, whether less, more or different. Our only concern is with the way the Partzuf in question governs once it has been fixed in its place in Atzilut. (The specific combination of selected parts in each case is not decisive in the revealed governmental order but only in the concealed governmental order.)
<b>However, what they are made from is now no longer recognizable...</b> For example, Atik is made from the first five Sefirot of Keter of BaN, the first three Sefirot of Chochmah, the first four of Binah and the seven Keters of the seven lower Sefirot... But these things are not recognizable in the revealed governmental order. We can compare this to a group of people assigned various duties by the king. We distinguish between the different people not in terms of any differences that may exist in their personal physical build but only in terms of their individual assignments. (The king assigns each one his particular duty because of his unique qualities, which are known to the king. However, the people involved do not have to understand why the king assigned a particular duty to a particular person. All they have to know is which duty they have been assigned.)
<b>...because the selected parts are already joined together...</b> Once joined together, their intrinsic nature became hidden and is now not visible. <b>...making the Partzufim equal...</b> When the selected parts were joined together in each case, this produced a Partzuf with the full nature required for the governmental order of Atzilut. Whatever had more parts needed more labor to attain this state, but once it reached it, it reached it. (Similarly, it may take more to repair a vessel that is more seriously damaged, but having been repaired, it is no less functional than a vessel that was less severely damaged.) Thus a Partzuf made of few selected parts with minimal labor attained the same as one made of many parts with much labor. What was required at the outset is no longer recognizable because, inasmuch as they are Partzufim, they are all equal (in the sense of being built with the same structure – the human form).
<b>...those made from certain selected portions being similar to those made from other selected portions.</b>

Chapter 84

<i>The different parts of MaH and BaN in each Partzuf have a concealed influence – but outwardly all are equal.</i>
<b>The way MaH is joined with BaN in the different Partzufim as a result of the process of selection and sorting that took place is certainly not without purpose. On the contrary, it gives the Partzufim important qualities – except that these are concealed within them. What is visible is only what was produced after the process of selection. And the order in which they are made to function depends on the identical form which all of them already have in common.</b>
<i>Although the way MaH and BaN are combined in the different Partzufim is not recognizable, it nevertheless has a purpose in the governmental order.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The way MaH is joined with BaN...</b> The way they are combined is not without purpose. <b>Part 2: ...except that these are concealed...</b> The resulting qualities are nevertheless concealed.
<b>Part 1: The way MaH is joined with BaN in the different Partzufim as a result of the process of selection and sorting that took place...</b> This refers to the interconnection we discussed earlier. <b>...is certainly not without purpose.</b> In other words, the way they are joined together in each case is not without purpose in the Partzufim themselves. For the way in which MaH and BaN are combined is not merely the root of the governmental order above, for it cannot fail to leave some mark on the Partzufim themselves. If the way MaH and BaN are joined were merely one overall hidden root of the governmental order, this would have had to be a separate level by itself out of which another level – Atzilut – would have then emerged. (In that case, the Unknown Head would have been no more than an intermediary level out of which Atzilut as a whole developed and would not have needed to have expression in each individual Partzuf through the particular combination of MaH and BaN making up that Partzuf.) Since the Partzufim themselves are in each case built of unique combinations of different parts of MaH and BaN, the combination of the two is not merely a general preparation for the world of Atzilut but must have an influence on the Partzufim themselves.
<b>On the contrary, it gives the Partzufim important qualities...</b> The way MaH and BaN are combined has an effect on the actual Partzufim themselves, except that it is not visible.
<b>Part 2: ...except that these are concealed within them.</b> The functioning of the Partzufim themselves has two different aspects. The first is how MaH and BaN are combined in each Partzuf. The second is how the Partzuf functions as a Partzuf in Atzilut. The latter aspect is revealed while the former is concealed.
<b>What is visible is only what was produced after the process of selection.</b> This is the essential aspect in Atzilut itself.
<b>And the order in which they are made to function...</b> This is the order in which they are arranged after their selection and purification. However, after this process of selection they are all equal. If so, this order is based not on the differences between them but rather on what they have in common. Accordingly, only what is compatible with this purpose is visible while the rest is concealed within it.
<b>...depends on the form which all of them already have in common.</b> For this was not ordered during the process of selection. Rather this is the order that held sway after the selection process as a result of what had already been done, and therefore all the Partzufim have the same form. (It is as if all are composed out of the same parts of MaH and BaN, each Partzuf being constructed out of 613 limbs.)

Chapter 85

<big><strong>The Unknown Head (Openings 85-89)</strong></big>
<i>The root of the interconnections between MaH and BaN lies in the Unknown Head while the results are found in the Partzufim, and both are concealed.</i>
<b>The location of the governmental order that depends on the interconnection of MaH with BaN is in the Unknown Head. The way this governmental order operates gives rise to a governmental order of major importance in the Partzufim. However, neither the underlying order nor its consequences are ascertainable or understandable in the least. Except that at times certain movements are seen in the Partzufim whose root is unknown, but the truth is that they derive from here.</b>
<i>Having discussed this governmental order of MaH and BaN, we will now examine its location.</i>
This proposition has two parts. <b> Part 1: The location...</b> This explains where this governmental order is located. <b>Part 2: However...</b> This location is concealed.
<b>Part 1: The location of the governmental order...</b> Every function is carried out on its own level. This level will either be one of the overall Ten Sefirot or a particular aspect of one of them. There has to be a place in which the function in question is fixed, from which its branches and resulting consequences extend to every place where they reach. That each function has its own level should be quite clear, because each light (אור, <i>ohr</i>) is one law of the supreme attribute which shines through the luminary (מאור, <i>ma’or</i>) in question, since it has already been instituted that each law should shine as one light. (The entire governmental order comes to teach about the will of God, and therefore each law is a light.) Since each law is one light and the overall governmental order is a single law, it follows that the entire governmental order is one light on a level of its own.
<b>...that depends on the interconnection of MaH with BaN is in the Unknown Head.</b> For the Partzufim are in Atzilut, but Atik is higher than all of them and is the head of all of them, and this was the first place where the joining of MaH and BaN occured. For the way they interconnect certainly has to be decided immediately at the outset, since before they start to join, it is necessary to lay down the pathway whereby the interconnection will be made. Once it has been laid down in this way, the same path will be followed in all the places lower down.
<b>The way this governmental order operates gives rise to a governmental order of major importance in the Partzufim.</b> This should be clear in the light of our discussion in the previous Opening.
<b>However, neither the underlying order nor its consequences...</b> i.e. what it brings about in the Partzufim<b> ...are ascertainable or understandable in the least.</b> This is why it is called the <i>Unknown</i> Head. <b>Even though at times certain movements are seen in the Parztufim whose root is unknown, the truth is that they derive from here.</b> This brings us to the subject of the uncertainties in the Unknown Head.

Chapter 86

<i>The uncertainties in the Unknown Head and their consequences in the Partzufim: opposites that all exist</i>
<b>All the different kinds of interconnections that could possibly exist between MaH and BaN were indeed made, and the essential concealed governmental order follows them all. There are ways of connecting that are opposite in nature yet even so, both connections exist – because this is the way the Partzufim are compounded, and both give rise to certain qualities in the Partzufim. The way these combinations rule above governs what happens in the Partzufim. However, this is not fathomable or visible in the least. Except that when we observe the differences found in the Partzufim in various different states and certain other changes that take place in them, we know that these derive from the way MaH and BaN are joined. However, no one sees them for what they truly are.</b>
<i>Having explained the location of the governmental order arising out of this interconnection of MaH and BaN, we will now consider it in more detail and discuss the uncertainties contained in the Unknown Head.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: All the different kinds of connections...</b> This explains what is contained in the Unknown Head as a result of the way MaH and BaN join together. <b>Part 2: The way these combinations rule above...</b> How this affects the Partzufim.
<b>Part 1: All the different kinds of connections that could possibly exist between MaH and BaN...</b> This whole subject relates to the “uncertainties” (ספקות, <i>sefeikot</i>) discussed by the ARI of blessed memory in connection with the Unknown Head. These are uncertainties relating to the way MaH and BaN are joined (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Atik</i> ch. 3ff). There are two apparent difficulties about these teachings. Firstly, of what benefit is it to know what these uncertainties are? Secondly, the ARI himself says – and it is necessarily the case – that just as there are uncertainties relating to the Unknown Head, so there are uncertainties in all the other Partzufim (ibid. ch. 5). If so, one could ask what reason there is to call this Head specifically the “Unknown Head” when all the rest of Atzilut is likewise unknown.
We could try to answer this by saying that this one is the first in the sense that it is in this Head that the uncertainties are first born, and only thereafter are they drawn into the other Partzufim of Atzilut. However, this does not seem consistent with the clear intent of the words of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai of blessed memory. For in the <i>Idra</i> <i>Zuta</i> (288a) it is evident that he calls this Head by this name because of its tremendous greatness and glory, and this is why it is concealed. (The implication is not as we tried to answer, that this Head is the first and the root with respect to the uncertainties. Rather, it is that the Head is unknown because of its very greatness and glory, and this is why it cannot be grasped.) For he says: “The Head that does not know and is not known... that is not attached to Wisdom and not to Understanding...” If so, all of Atzilut is the same – so what special reason is there to call this Head by this name? (The same greatness and glory are also in the other Partzufim as well as uncertainties as to their composition.)
The answer is that the Unknown Head stands as a single governmental order which requires it to be this way with these uncertainties. And because of its power and control, these uncertainties are also found in the other Partzufim as aspects that develop as a result. The uncertainties we are talking about are not the normal kind of uncertainties where we are in doubt about whether something is or is not the case. With regard to the uncertainties discussed in relation to the Unknown Head, the truth is that all the different combinations of MaH and BaN do indeed exist (even though they appear contradictory). Bearing this in mind will help you to understand why it is that the uncertainties we are discussing arise, especially all the details discussed by the ARI of blessed memory, which we could not have conceived at all. Granted, there may be matters of doubt relating to the lights and vessels of BaN and all that depends on this. But as for all the other uncertainties relating to the detailed interconnections between MaH and BaN in the Unknown Head (<i>Etz Chayim, Shaar Atik</i> ch. 3) – what is the reason for the uncertainty?
The reason is that it is this very Head itself – as far as we can have any knowledge of it at all – that causes these uncertainties. One moment it seems one way and another moment it seems different. If this Head were completely concealed, we could simply say in one word that its function is hidden from us without going into detail about what it is that is uncertain. However, as I have said, the fact is that all these different and contradictory aspects can be discerned. (They can only appear one after another but they exist simultaneously.) However, it is simply impossible to come to a definite conclusion and determine any one facet with absolute certainty.
For as you have already heard (Openings 6-7), each governmental order is one light through seeing which it is possible to understand the governmental order or aspect in question. Now this Unknown Head is one kind of light traveling in the mode of “running and returning” (<i>Idra</i>, ibid.) in which all these different aspects can be seen but it is impossible to gain a definite grasp of any one of them. What one sees is uncertain and without any stability, because one moment it appears one way, but on further examination it looks different.
<b>...were indeed made...</b> For these combinations of MaH and BaN are all the different ways in which goodness can spread in order to bring evil back to good. Clearly if a single interconnection had been missing, one repair would have been lacking, whereas everything must be repaired. On the contrary, it is the power to create different combinations that joins one thing to another detail by detail until all the different parts are joined to each other in every possible way.
<b>...and the essential concealed governmental order follows them all.</b> These combinations of MaH and BaN constitute the laws of the concealed governmental order we are discussing. Just as the revealed governmental order is made up of detailed laws – the laws of the Partzufim and all that depends on them, these being orders sufficient to govern all that exists in every aspect of their government – similarly, this concealed governmental order consists of detailed individual laws sufficient to govern everything within it. These laws are the combinations of MaH and BaN.
The difference between the concealed and revealed orders is that in the case of the latter, all its different aspects are visible individually and we are certain that they all exist. But the different aspects of the concealed order are not known with the same certainty. Rather, its laws are known only as uncertainties. (The laws, which are all the different possibilities of repair and damage, derive from all the possible combinations of MaH and BaN. What is unknown is which of the possible combinations functions and when. See <i>Etz Chayim, Shaar Atik</i> ch. 5: “...there are uncertainties without end”.) Seeing various kinds of pathways, we know that all these pathways exist. However, it is impossible to determine anything with certainty when looking at this Head because things keep turning into the opposite. (It is impossible to formulate an all-encompassing law to explain the entire governmental order because it depends on which roots of the creation need to be repaired, and they are unknown to us.)
<b>There are ways of connecting that are opposite in nature...</b> i.e. in the way they are combined, for every element is joined with all the others. Their interconnections are thus literally the opposite of one another. (Simple elements can be combined in opposite ways.)
<b>...yet even so, both connections exist...</b> i.e. both of the contrary and opposite combinations. And this is not problematic, because both exist in order for each to rule over one aspect by itself. The Partzufim also have qualities deriving from one combination of MaH and BaN and qualities from the other.
<b>...because this is the way the Partzufim are compounded, and both give rise to certain qualities in the Partzufim.</b> However, sometimes one power and quality rules, and sometimes another.
<b>Part 2: The way these combinations rule above governs what happens in the Partzufim.</b> As we have said, the Partzufim are bound up with these interconnections between MaH and BaN, which give rise to certain qualities in them. It follows that a change in the ruling combinations will lead to change in the qualities ruling in the Partzufim. <b>However, this is not fathomable or visible in the least.</b> In other words, this root is not known, because it is not revealed.
<b>Except that when we observe the differences found in the Partzufim...</b> For the differences are visible in the Partzufim. <b>...in various different states and certain other changes that take place in them...</b>  For sometimes lights and repairs are seen to hold sway in the Partzufim and sometimes deficiencies. These are the changes in the states and functioning of the Partzufim as discussed in the teachings of the ARI of blessed memory in connection with these uncertainties.  <b>...we know that these derive from the way MaH and BaN are joined.</b> The Unknown Head is the root of all this – i.e. these changes derive from there.
<b>However, no one sees them for what they truly are.</b> Because this root is not visible, it is impossible to grasp and understand their true nature.

Chapter 87

<i>The different combinations in the Unknown Head rule as one all the time and are unfathomable.</i>
<b>All the deeds that have been and are being done in the world are subject to these interconnections. For anything that was not rooted here, be it a repair or damage of some kind, will not come about. All things are governed in accordance with all these combinations, depending on the deeds of the lower creations. And everything is going to be fixed in eternity, every single thing in accordance with everything that has already been done, whether they be equivalent, contrary or opposite to one another. Therefore all these combinations have control all the time, and the government turns from one to the other in each thing, shifting from one aspect to another that may be similar, contrary or opposite to the first, because the entire governmental order exists in each part. And the states of the Partzufim shift correspondingly in the mode of “running and returning”. And no one can understand or grasp anything except what is revealed through the order and law visible in the Partzufim. But the source of the matter lies in these combinations, and this is not revealed or known at all.</b>
<i>Following our discussion of these interconnections in the Unknown Head, we must now explain their significance.</i>
This proposition consists of three parts. <b>Part 1: All the deeds...</b> All deeds are subject to these interconnections. <b>Part 2: All things are governed...</b> The entire governmental order follows accordingly. <b>Part 3: Therefore...</b> All these different combinations hold sway continually.
<b>Part 1: All the deeds that have been and are being done in the world are subject to these interconnections.</b> The mystery of God’s knowledge is that it contains everything that is going to happen in the very way it will happen. <b>For anything that was not rooted here, be it a repair or damage of some kind, will not come into being.</b> For what is not included in this knowledge (i.e. in the possibilities already prepared in the Unknown Head) will never come about.
<b>Part 2: All things are governed in accordance with all these combinations, depending on the deeds of the lower creations.</b> For the governmental order always takes into account the overall totality (see Opening 78). Thus every new deed has an effect on all the past, all the present and all the future. The result of that deed will never cease to exist, as I have already discussed, but is registered to exist for ever and to all eternity. Thus the way things are arranged is as follows: every deed performed by man reaches its place here, because all of them are already here. (In the Unknown Head are all the deeds of the past, present and future.) Here all the different aspects, past, present and future, are affected by this deed, because all of them are included here. Through the power of the deed’s effect, the Partzufim, following the order of Atzilut, are afterwards arranged in such a way as to act in the worlds. (The influence is mutual: the deed affects the Unknown Head, which in turn affects the Partzufim.)
<b>And everything is going to be fixed in eternity...</b> As stated above, every deed endures for the sake of the perfection destined to be revealed afterwards for the eternal delight of the souls. (The souls will enjoy the perfection of the governmental order that will be revealed through that deed.) <b>...every single thing in accordance with everything that has already been done...</b> As we have said, everything is affected by everything. <b>...whether they be equivalent, contrary or opposite to one another.</b> These are the three possible kinds.
<b>Part 3: Therefore all these combinations have control all the time...</b> In the case of the other lights in the other Partzufim of Atzilut, each one holds sway by itself in its own time. However those in the Unknown Head hold sway all the time, for in every deed they are all affected simultaneously. <b>...and the government turns from one to the other in each thing, shifting from one aspect to another that may be similar, contrary or opposite to the first...</b> This is the uncertain appearance seen in the Unknown Head, for in it the government turns from aspect to aspect in all the different aspects, so that all different kinds of combinations are seen constantly.
<b>...because the entire governmental order exists in each part.</b> <b>And the states of the Partzufim shift correspondingly in the mode of “running and returning”.</b> These different states give rise to the different qualities found in the Partzufim, as mentioned in the previous Opening. <b>And no one can understand or grasp anything except what is revealed through the order and law visible in the Partzufim.</b> The only grasp we have of these changes is as it is expressed in the order of the Partzufim. However, it is called the order of the Unknown Head, because it is from here that it derives, but this cannnot be known. <b>But the source of the matter lies in these combinations, and this is not revealed or known at all.</b> The rule is that a branch of something that is concealed may be revealed, but the root itself always remains concealed.

Chapter 88

<i>The Unknown Head contains all the interconnections; the uncertainty lies in trying to grasp it.</i>
<b>The Unknown Head is a single radiation containing all these interconnections of MaH and BaN. However, it is a radiation that is impossible to grasp or understand at all. Looking at it leaves one with various kinds of uncertainties, because it does not seem as if it would contain all kinds of interconnections – it is a kind of radiation that is impossible to understand. And in truth, what it contains is not apparent, because sometimes one interconnection appears to exist in it and sometimes a different interconnection that may even be opposite to the first.</b>
<b>Thus although we already know that it contains all the different interconnections, the radiation itself nevertheless stands in such a way that it is impossible to understand. First it appears one way, then differently. As a result, the way it governs is unknown. For if we were to try to follow a single thing that exists below in Atzilut and trace its root in this Head, we would not be able to find our arms and legs – we would be unable to determine anything about it. First it appears like this, then it appears like that – in such a way that it is quite impossible to understand it. This is why it is called the Unknown Head.</b>
<i>This answers an apparent difficulty, because according to what we are saying there should not be any uncertainties since it contains everything.</i>
The proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: The Unknown Head... Part 2: Thus although...</b>
<b>Part 1: The Unknown Head is a single radiation containing all these interconnections of MaH and BaN.</b> It is a light that cannot be grasped in the same way as the other lights. And this is the answer to something that may appear problematic. For it might seem as if there was no need to say that there are uncertainties about it. Should we not have said rather that it certainly contains all the interconnections? The explanation is that we are not talking about what is intrinsic in the Head itself but rather about our ability to grasp and understand it: one who attains a perception of the radiance of this Head cannot determine how to understand this light. <b>However, it is a radiation that is impossible to grasp or understand at all.</b> I.e. when looking at it.
The reason is that <b>Looking at it leaves one with various kinds of uncertainties...</b> The uncertainty is in the observer gazing at this Head and its lights. <b>...because it does not seem as if it would contain all kinds of interconnections...</b> Even though we say that it contains everything, this is not the way it appears when one looks at it. Rather <b>...it is a kind of radiation that is impossible to understand.</b> In other words, this is the intrinsic nature of this radiation.<b> And in truth, what it contains is not apparent...</b> Even what it contains is not seen at all – even when we think we understand, we afterwards see that we have not understood it. <b>...because sometimes one interconnection appears to exist in it and sometimes a different interconnection that may even be opposite to the first.</b>
<b>Part 2: Thus although we already know that it contains all the different interconnections, the radiation itself nevertheless stands in such a way that it is impossible to understand. First it appears one way, then differently.</b> The apparent problem we raised above is not really a problem – because the radiation itself is one that is intrinsically unknowable. <b>As a result, the way it governs is unknown.</b> If you ask what is gained from this uncertainty since we already know that this Head contains everything, the answer is that it is the mode of government ruling at any specific time that we do not know.
<b>For if we were to try to follow a single thing that exists below in Atzilut and trace its root in this Head, we would not be able to find our arms and legs – we would be unable to determine anything about it. </b>We might have thought that since this Head is the root of Atzilut, we should have been able to ascend from the branch (=Atzilut) to the root (=the Unknown Head) and thereby grasp it. However, because our perception of the root is uncertain, we are unable to grasp it. If we try to trace anything to the root, we are always left uncertain as to whether it lies on one side or another – i.e. in one given interconnection or another. This is impossible to determine, because it looks as if both combinations rule, yet this is certainly not the case. For everything surely has its own particular place – the entire governmental order runs through one particular aspect at any given time. It is the place in the source, the ruling combination in which any given aspect of Atzilut is rooted, that is uncertain – because it looks as if it could be all of them. At first it looks like one thing, but on further examination it looks like something else, and it is impossible to come to a definite conclusion.
<b>First it appears like this, then it appears like that – in such a way that it is quite impossible to understand it. This is why it is called the Unknown Head.</b> If nothing at all were visible in it, we would have said it is concealed. However, it is seen – but first it seems one way, and then immediately afterwards it seems different, so that no one can understand it.

Chapter 89

<i>The difference between the Dew of Bedolach and the Unknown Head</i>
<b>There is a difference between the nature of the Dew of Bedolach “in which all colors are seen” and the Unknown Head. For the Dew of Bedolach is seen to contain all the colors together. However this Head appears to be one thing and then immediately afterwards it seems to be not this but the very opposite of what we saw. It remains in this state of constant transmutation in which the yes and the no appear at one and the same moment – yet we cannot even grasp how the yes and the no can both apply. It is simply impossible to attain any certainty about it, because sometimes it appears as if it contains the yes and then immediately afterwards it looks as if that is not the case at all.</b>
<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE</small></b></sup><i class="footnote"> The <i>bedolach</i> stone – a gleaming crystal – is mentioned in Genesis 2:12, while in Numbers 11:7 the color of the manna is compared to that of the <i>bedolach</i>. The <i>Idra Rabba</i> (128b) describes the appearance of the dew descending from the Head of Arich Anpin as being “white like the color of the <i>bedolach</i> stone, in which all colors are seen”.</i><b>There is a difference between the nature of the Dew of Bedolach “in which all colors are seen” and the Unknown Head.</b> Why this Head is said to be a matter of doubt and uncertainty may still seem problematic. Why is it not like the Dew of Bedolach, which contains all the colors – for the same is said about this Head. The answer is as follows.
<b>For the Dew of Bedolach is seen to contain all the colors together.</b> As explained in the <i>Zohar</i>, it clearly contains both Kindness and Judgment: “It is white, but a red color is visible in the white...” (<i>Idra Rabba</i> 128b and see 132b). Thus all the colors are visible in the bedolach stone: no one color rules out another. However here in the Unknown Head, one thing rules out another.
<b>However this Head appears to be one thing and then immediately afterwards it seems to be not this but the very opposite of what we saw.</b> It seems as if we were mistaken in how we saw it at first, and that it is different from the way we saw it. <b>It remains in this state of constant transmutation...</b> This is clear as discussed in the previous Opening in connection with the impossibility of determining the source of the mode of government.
<b>...in which the yes and the no appear at one and the same moment...</b> These are the opposites: the one contradicts the other.
<b>...yet we cannot even grasp how the yes and the no can both apply.</b> It is not that we are able to understand that both of these two opposites are contained in it, for that could not yet be considered an uncertainty. Rather, the uncertainty lies in the fact that first we see it in one way but then afterwards it seems as if it was not that way at all. Accordingly –
<b>It is simply impossible to attain any certainty about it, because sometimes it appears as if it contains the yes and then immediately afterwards it looks as if that is not the case at all. </b>The essence of the matter is that all the interconnections stand concealed within the interior of this Head. However the Head radiates through the mystery of its rulership, and this is essentially what determines the direction of the governmental order. For the power which the Head exercises depends on the way it shines. The radiant splendor (זוהר, <i>zohar</i>) which shines forth from the light contained within the interior of the Head that is not Known is what rules at any given time. However, we are unable to grasp the nature of this radiant splendor, let alone the interior light itself. The reason why we cannot understand the nature of this radiant splendor and from where it derives is that one moment it seems one way and then it seems different and it is therefore impossible to understand. We thus conclude that what is within is not even seen, while even that which can be perceived – i.e. the radiant splendor – is also a matter of uncertainty and is not known. This is why it is called the Unknown Head.

<big><strong>The Partzuf of Arich Anpin (Openings 90-95)</strong></big>
<i>Arich Anpin is the root; the other Partzufim are branches.</i>
<b>Arich Anpin is the first Partzuf in Atzilut and is built of MaH and BaN. Arich Anpin is the root of all the rest of Atzilut, for all the other Partzufim are literally branches of Arich Anpin, which executes its functions through them.</b>
<i>Having discussed Atik, we must now discuss the Parzuf that comes after it – Arich Anpin.</i>
<b>Arich Anpin is the first Partzuf in Atzilut...</b> For the place where the ten Sefirot of any given world start is called the beginning (ראשית, <i>reishit</i>) of that world. In the case of Atzilut this is none other than Arich Anpin, which is Keter of Atzilut. Atik, on the other hand, is not actually a part of Atzilut itself but is considered related to Atzilut inasmuch as Atik exists for the sake of Atzilut and is clothed in and directs it.
<b>...and is built of MaH and BaN.</b> For all of Atzilut is built of MaH and BaN. In the case of Arich Anpin, this MaH and BaN are its male and female aspects.
<b>Arich Anpin is the root of all the rest of Atzilut...</b> The difference between Arich Anpin and the other Partzufim is that each of the other Partzufim is a separate branch. Even though in terms of their development they emerge from one another, the truth is that they are not branches of one another. Rather, they are all branches of Arich Anpin. Accordingly Arich Anpin cannot be considered in the same category as the other Partzufim of Atzilut since Arich Anpin is the root while the others are branches of Arich. However, when speaking of Atzilut as a whole with its root and branches, we also include Arich Anpin. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai alludes to this mystery in his words in the <i>Idra Zuta</i> (288a): “Only the Lamp exists”.
<b>...for all the other Partzufim are literally branches of Arich Anpin...</b> They are not branches of Arich Anpin merely in the way in which they seem to be branches of one another inasmuch as they emerge from one another in the developmental chain. In relation to Arich Anpin, the other Partzufim are actual branches.
<b>...which executes its functions through them.</b> For the entire governmental order is rooted in Arich Anpin, except that in order for it to be revealed, it divides into the four Partzufim that clothe Arich. These are called “the Name of Atik” (<i>Idra Zuta</i>, ibid.). For this reason Arich Anpin extends the length of the entire world, while all the other four Partzufim clothe Arich – Abba and Imma to the navel, Zeir Anpin and the Nukva from the navel and below. Accordingly, all of them are only garments on Arich Anpin. Each garment clothes only one part, but together all of them clothe Arich Anpin completely.

Chapter 91

<i>Arich Anpin in itself functions with complete Kindness, its branches with Justice.</i>
<b>There are two aspects to Arich Anpin. One is the way it governs with complete Kindness through its own intrinsic essence. The other is the way it governs through its branches in the mode of Judgment, until in the very end everything will return to the essential nature of Arich Anpin.</b>
<i>Having introduced the subject of Arich Anpin, let us now enter into the details.</i>
<b>There are two aspects to Arich Anpin</b>. Having said that Arich Anpin functions through its branches, we must infer that Arich has two aspects, because the functioning of the branches is also bound up with Arich itself. Arich thus has its own independent function without having need of its branches for this (as in exercising the Attributes of the Beard, תיקוני דיקנא, <i>tikkuney dikna</i>, lit. the repairs or adornments of the beard). For Arich Anpin in itself is the source of influence and many repairs (which derive from the concealed governmental order of unity). In addition Arich Anpin also functions through its branches, for the functions that we see being carried out are all functions of Arich Anpin. Since everything has a root, the functioning of the branches rooted in Arich must have a specific individual root in Arich Anpin itself, as will be discussed below (Opening 95).
<b>One is the way it governs with complete Kindness…</b> For Zeir Anpin also contains Kindness, but includes Judgment as well. However, Arich Anpin’s intrinsic mode of government is all complete Kindness with no Judgment at all. (“This Eye is entirely right and contains no left” – <i>Idra Zuta</i> 289a).
<b>…through its own intrinsic essence.</b> As stated above, this mode of government derives from Arich Anpin in itself not acting through its branches.
<b>The other is the way it governs through its branches…</b> i.e. through their functioning. <b>…in the mode of Judgment…</b> This is the whole difference: when Arich Anpin acts by itself, it is with complete kindness. However, when it acts through its branches, Kindness is mixed with Judgment depending on man’s behavior in the lower world.
<b>…until in the very end everything will return to the essential nature of Arich Anpin.</b> Since Arich Anpin is complete Kindness, why should it execute Justice? The intention is that since Arich Anpin is complete Kindness, it will not execute Justice, but its branches have the power to do so. Arich Anpin therefore uses this intermediary in order that something will exist that can execute justice, since this is not Arich’s own intrinsic attribute. However the intention is not that things should stay this way. On the contrary, since it is really Arich Anpin acting, even though at first it may appear that Arich is willing for Justice to be done, the intention is that in the very end Arich Anpin alone will rule and govern everything with Kindness.

Chapter 92

<i>Zeir Anpin – Justice – comes from Arich Anpin – beneficence – and is therefore entirely for good.</i>
<b>The ultimate intention behind the entire order of the Sefirot and the way they govern is to bestow complete and perfect good in the very end. It is just that in order to reach this ultimate goal it is necessary to go through the entire cycle until the end. The world must be governed with justice and the sinners punished in order that afterwards the goodness bestowed will be complete. The justice which is required prior to the end thus derives from the ultimate purpose itself – even though they seem contradictory. Thus the nature of Arich and Zeir Anpin is that Arich Anpin is rooted in the mystery of complete beneficence, for Arich Anpin only bestows good. Yet even so, out of Arich emerges Zeir Anpin, which is rooted in the mystery of Justice, for Zeir Anpin is born out of the intrinsic purpose of Arich Anpin itself.</b>
<i>Having explained the intrinsic nature of Arich Anpin, we will now discuss the reason for the emergence of Zeir Anpin out of Arich Anpin.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The ultimate intention…</b> This explains how Justice itself derives from the intention to bestow good. <b>Part 2: Thus the nature…</b> This explains the purpose of Arich and Zeir Anpin accordingly.
<b>Part 1: The ultimate intention behind the entire order of the Sefirot and the way they govern…</b> In the light of all we have discussed above it is clear that the ultimate intention, even in the Sefirot themselves, is to bestow good. This means that even in the Residue, which provides the possibility of good and evil, the ultimate goal is to bestow good in the end.
<b>…is to bestow complete and perfect good in the very end.</b> Even though we see many harsh things in the present government of the world, the purpose is not only to bestow goodness but to bestow <i>complete</i> goodness – the very opposite of the harsh Judgment found now.
<b>It is just that in order to reach this ultimate goal it is necessary to go through the entire cycle until the end.</b> The cycle (גלגול, <i>gilgul</i>) of things will continue until they eventually come to rest from their cycles. For they cannot reach the state of rest in a single moment but only through these cycles.
<b>The world must be governed with justice and the sinners punished…</b> It is through the punishment of the sinners that evil is removed from the world.
<b>…in order that afterwards the goodness bestowed will be complete.</b> For afterwards all the creations will enjoy complete goodness without any shame, as discussed earlier (Opening 4).
<b>The justice which is required prior to the end thus derives from the ultimate purpose itself – even though they seem contradictory.</b> This is what must be considered carefully in order to understand afterwards the various different levels and aspects of Atzilut. These are specific attributes calculated to serve the overall governmental order, as discussed earlier.
<b>Part 2: Thus the nature of Arich and Zeir Anpin…</b> In other words, the governmental order is essentially bound up with these two, as the proposition goes on to explain. For Abba and Imma are merely a continuation through which Zeir Anpin emerges out of Arich Anpin, as will be discussed below (Opening 111). However, the government of the worlds runs through these two, whether in the governmental mode of Kindness – Arich Anpin – or in that of Justice, which bestows good only on those who are good while punishing the wicked – Zeir Anpin.
<b>…is that Arich Anpin is rooted in the mystery of complete beneficence, for Arich Anpin only bestows good. </b>Arich Anpin is as it will be in the end, when there will be only good. Thus Arich Anpin’s only purpose in all aspects is to bestow good through the mystery of the unity that brings all evil back to good. The Sefirot themselves contain this aspect (of Arich Anpin clothed within Zeir Anpin) in order for the world to survive. For if the governmental order had not been built on this but instead the world had been governed only in the mode of Justice through the Sefirot, it would not have been able to endure because of the wicked.
Accordingly the Supreme Thought prepared in advance in the Sefirot themselves not only the aspect of the Line that exists everywhere but also Arich Anpin, which is the mystery of what will be at the very end. For then the Sefirot themselves will be repaired through the path of unity, which brings complete beneficence. This is the mystery of how the Line purifies the Residue. (The Line is present in each Sefirah in order to repair it in the end. In addition, there is one particular Partzuf, Arich Anpin, whose function is to bring the governmental order – made up of the Sefirot – to a state of repair.) This is the “last in deed, first in thought”.
<b>Yet even so, out of Arich emerges Zeir Anpin…</b> This is clearly what happens in the chain of development, as explained in the <i>Idra Zuta</i> (292a): “Zeir Anpin depends on and is unified with Atika Kadisha (=Arich)”.
<b>…which is rooted in the mystery of Justice…</b> Justice is the mystery of the as yet unpurified Residue, which functions and rules in the mode of Justice until the Line gains sway over it, after which Zeir Anpin will turn back and bestow only good like Arich Anpin. Thus the Attribute of Judgment turns back into the Attribute of Mercy.
<b>…for Zeir Anpin is born out of the intrinsic purpose of Arich Anpin itself.</b> In other words, this is the way it has to be in order to attain true and complete beneficence. The Residue must fulfill its function – and in the very end it will be sweetened. There will then exist what is already prepared through Arich Anpin’s foresight, for He foresaw the future and made Arich for the sake of the future – already repaired, as discussed above.

Chapter 93

<i>Zeir Anpin derives from Arich Anpin.</i>
<b>The fact that Justice emerges only for the sake of the bestowal of complete good mitigates that very Justice itself. For after all, the purpose of the King is only to bestow good – except that Justice is necessary in order to attain the bestowal of good to perfection. This would not be so if the only purpose of Justice were to take vengeance upon the sinners. Thus Arich Anpin’s intrinsic existence in itself mitigates the stern judgments of Zeir Anpin through Arich’s own functioning, even without intensifying its radiations over Zeir Anpin so as to remove the latter’s stern Judgment.</b>
<i>Having discussed the emergence of Zeir Anpin from Arich Anpin, we will now explain what is thereby gained and how Arich Anpin mitigates the severity of Zeir Anpin.</i>
This proposition has two parts.<b> Part 1: The fact that...</b> This explains how Justice is mitigated because it stems from the ultimate purpose – the bestowal of good.<b> Part 2: Thus Arich Anpin’s intrinsic existence...</b> This explains how the severity of Zeir Anpin is accordingly mitigated through Arich Anpin.
<b>Part 1: The fact that Justice emerges only for the sake of the bestowal of complete good mitigates that very Justice itself. For after all, the purpose of the King is only to bestow good…</b> The Supreme Will could have chosen to govern with Justice alone and nothing more. In that case He would have had to give full power to Justice on all sides – in bestowing good (upon only those who justly deserve it) and in inflicting punishment. However, since the goal is only to bestow complete good and He metes out Justice only because this is necessary to bestow complete good – for if He could have done it without this He would have done so – His intention is certainly to mitigate strict Justice to the fullest possible extent.
<b>…except that Justice is necessary in order to attain the bestowal of good to perfection. This would not be so if the only purpose of Justice were to take vengeance upon the sinners. </b>For in that case the intention would have been to give full strength to Justice. That is the mark of the Other Side: since it only wants to harm, it gives full power to evil. (“The rebellion of the Other Side – though it has no power against God – lies in thinking that it has” – <i>Ginzey Ramchal</i> p. 41.). But the Supreme Will – whose intention is to bestow good – metes out Justice only because this is necessary, but the intention is to sweeten it, as stated above.
<b>Part 2: Thus Arich Anpin’s intrinsic existence in itself mitigates the stern judgments of Zeir Anpin through Arich’s own functioning…</b> All the repairs (תיקונים, <i>tikkunim</i>) found in Arich Anpin as enumerated in the <i>Idra Rabba</i> are nothing but powers and modes of government specific to Arich Anpin in the sense that Arich’s mere existence and the fact that it has these repairs intrinsically brings about a mitigation in Zeir Anpin. (Even without prevailing over Zeir Anpin but merely as its root, Arich Anpin directs all aspects of Zeir Anpin towards repair even though this is not yet visible from the side of Zeir Anpin itself, which shows “manifest reproof arising out of hidden love”.) The ultimate purpose of the very things that exist below in Zeir Anpin in the category of strict judgment is only kindness – to bestow good in the end. And on the level of Arich Anpin, this is revealed. (Thus the forehead of Zeir Anpin contains twenty-four Courts of Judgment whereas the forehead of Arich Anpin is all Kindness – <i>Idra Rabba</i> 136b.)
<b>…even without intensifying its radiations over Zeir Anpin so as to remove the latter’s stern Judgment.</b> This refers to a different repair (תיקון, <i>tikkun</i>) found at times, when Arich Anpin removes stern Judgment so that it has no power at all, as explained in connection with the mystical intentions of “and [the Lord] passed by” (Exodus 34:6; see <i>Idra Rabba</i> 131b and <i>Shaar HaKavanot</i>, <i>Derushey Vayaavor</i>). However this is not the main purpose of the governmental order, which requires Judgment without it becoming too powerful. This is achieved through the existence of Arich Anpin, which consists of the very same aspects as Zeir Anpin except that they are in accordance with the ultimate intention, not in accordance with the means that precedes the final goal.

Chapter 94

<i>At times Arich Anpin removes Zeir Anpin’s stern judgments entirely.</i>
<b>In order for the world to survive it is sometimes necessary for beneficence to prevail over Justice and execute Kindness even though Judgment does not warrant this. This is when the radiation of Arich Anpin prevails over Zeir Anpin and removes its strict judgments completely.</b>
<i>Following our discussion of how Arich Anpin intrinsically mitigates the severity of Zeir Anpin, we will now explain how Arich Anpin may prevail over Zeir Anpin and remove its stern judgments entirely.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: In order for…</b> This explains that at times it is necessary to suspend the rule of Judgment.<b> Part 2: This is when… </b>This explains the consequent governmental relationship between Arich and Zeir Anpin.
<b>In order for the world to survive it is sometimes necessary for beneficence to prevail over Justice… </b>Even though the Supreme Will wanted the world to be governed with Justice, He saw from the beginning that the creations would be unable to endure such Justice. Accordingly, He instituted as part of the governmental order that at times Kindness should prevail completely and altogether suspend the rule of Justice. However this does not apply at all times but only at certain specific times and junctures, and moreover, even this still follows the principle of Justice.
For the commandments are divided into two kinds. There are some commandments whose purpose is to bring about specific repairs in direct proportion to the deed, and they bring about a specific practical repair in a given area. On the other hand there is another kind that cause a suspension of Judgment whereby Arich Anpin prevails and suspends the operation of Judgment. (An example of the latter is the commandment to blow the shofar.) Kindness then rules over everything, for the effect of fulfilling such a commandment is not to bring about a specific corresponding result. Rather, everything is arranged in such a way as to be subject to this act, for a general compassion is aroused causing everything to be repaired.
<b>…and execute Kindness even though Judgment does not warrant this.</b> Instead of adhering strictly to the principle that the punishment must match the deed, the reward is that Kindness is aroused and operates in the way of Kindness – doing good to all.
<b>Part 2: This is when the radiation of Arich Anpin prevails over Zeir Anpin…</b> Arich Anpin radiates in Zeir Anpin at all times. However, when this radiation becomes extremely powerful, Kindness rules over everything. <b>…and removes its strict judgments completely.</b> The strict judgments of Zeir Anpin then have no influence whatever – though not in the sense that Zeir Anpin remains in the category of strict Judgment while Arich Anpin acts kindly in the world. Rather, the strict judgments are not found in Zeir Anpin itself and have no power at all. This is the “forehead of favor” which mitigates all the stern judgments on Shabbat or at every other time when it is awakened.

Chapter 95

<i>The Skull and Brain, discussed in Idra Rabba – Arich Anpin’s intrinsic government mode; The Three Heads, discussed in Idra Zuta – Arich’s mode in generating Zeir Anpin.</i>
<b>Since Zeir Anpin emerges from Arich Anpin, we must therefore understand two things about Arich Anpin. The first is those aspects of Arich’s government that are bound up with its own intrinsic nature: how Arich governs according to what it is in itself in its own governmental mode of Kindness. The second is Arich Anpin as the root that generates Zeir Anpin. In connection with Arich’s own intrinsic mode of government we reckon only the Skull and the Brain together with the other repairs relating to their functions in increasing the strength of Kindness. But in connection with the generation of Zeir Anpin we reckon Three Heads – the Crown, the Cavity and the Brain – and all the other repairs that generate repairs in Zeir Anpin.</b>
<i>Having explained how Zeir Anpin emerges from and is governed by Arich Anpin, we must now discuss where the root of this government lies in Arich Anpin itself.</i>
The proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: Since Zeir Anpin…</b> This introductory premise states that we must understand the governmental mode with which Arich Anpin governs Zeir Anpin as something separate from Arich Anpin’s own intrinsic mode of government.<b> Part 2: In connection with Arich’s…</b> This explains where this root lies in Arich Anpin.
<b>Part 1: Since Zeir Anpin emerges from Arich Anpin, we must therefore understand two things about Arich Anpin. </b>Every function in existence must be traced to a particular light. If it is a general function – a unique governmental mode that does not depend on some other mode – then it must be traced to a light of its own. However, if it is a governmental mode that depends on some other mode, then it must be rooted in one of the parts of the general light from which it stems. Accordingly, since in addition to Arich Anpin’s intrinsic mode of government it also generates Zeir Anpin, Arich Anpin must necessarily contain a certain aspect that is the specific root of this.
<b>The first is those aspects of Arich’s government that are bound up with its own intrinsic nature: how Arich governs according to what it is in itself in its own governmental mode of Kindness.</b> The intrinsic nature of Arich Anpin is to bestow good on all and to desire no evil whatever. Accordingly Arich Anpin certainly contains corresponding arrangements and repairs, just as is necessarily the case in every light depending on the governmental law instituted in it. For depending on their law of operation, the lights have many different arrangements and repairs in order to be able to execute their functions and radiate their light to all who need it.<b> The second is Arich Anpin as the root that generates Zeir Anpin.</b> This too requires arrangements and repairs in accordance with this law.
<b>Part 2: In connection with Arich’s own intrinsic mode of government…</b> You have already heard how the lights change their names and states depending on their functions. What is reckoned as a level on its own in one function may be considered as merely a part of a more encompassing level in some other function. On the other hand, what was included as a part of another level in one function may be reckoned as a level by itself in a different function. (Thus in connection with Arich Anpin’s own intrinsic functioning we reckon two Heads – the Skull and the Brain – while the Cavity [אווירא, <i>avira</i>] is considered as included in the Brain. However with regard to Arich’s function of generating Zeir Anpin, the Cavity is considered as a Head in itself – the middle Head.) They are the same lights: all the distinctions between them relate to their different functions. Thus in one aspect the lights of Arich Anpin are arranged in one order and in a different aspect they are arranged in a different order.
<b>…we reckon only the Skull and the Brain…</b> Both these aspects are mentioned in both <i>Idras</i> – the <i>Idra Rabba</i> and <i>Idra Zuta</i>. The <i>Idra Rabba</i> speaks only of the Skull and the Brain within it (mentioning the Cavity only as the membrane of the concealed brain), while specifying in detail all the repairs instituted in the hairs and nose, explaining each institution individually in full (see<i> Idra Rabba</i> p. 128b). On the other hand the <i>Idra Zuta</i> mentions Three Heads and does not speak at any length about the repairs, making only brief reference to them in order to bring them under the overall premise discussed there. (<i>Idra Zuta </i>p. 288a, and see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i> ch. 3: “the Three Heads include the Cavity”.)
The reason for this is as follows: Arich Anpin’s intrinsic governmental mode of Kindness as explained above is the foundation of all the repairs instituted in Arich, which are particular aspects of the Partzuf – the repairs (תיקונים, <i>tikkunim</i>) explained there in the <i>Idra</i> – all of which serve to increase the strength of Kindness and sweeten the power of Judgment. In this mode we do not need to speak of Three Heads but only – in terms of the human form – of Keter, the mystery of the indwelling influence of the higher level over the lower (see Opening 101), and the Brain contained within it, while afterwards the rest of the human form corresponds to the unfolding of the developmental sequence stage by stage.
However inasmuch as Arich Anpin is the root of Zeir Anpin – the governmental order of Justice, which depends on Kindness, Judgment and Mercy – the lights of Arich must also be arranged according to the mystery of these three. This is the mystery of the Three Heads. This is where the developmental chain of Abba and Imma comes in. (Abba and Imma are mentioned only in the <i>Idra Zuta</i>, which explains what relates to the generation of Zeir Anpin – involving Abba and Imma.) That is to say, while Kindness, Judgment and Mercy are rooted here, this is not their actual place (for the Three Heads in Arich Anpin do not contain Kindness-Judgment-Mercy as such but only their root).
From here the developmental chain must descend level by level until it reaches the actual place of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy on the level of Zeir Anpin, as will be fully explained below with the help of Heaven (see Openings 105 &amp; 114). This is what is discussed in the <i>Idra Zuta</i>, where the intention is not to set out the repairs of Arich Anpin but only to show that they are also all consistent with Arich Anpin’s being the root of Zeir Anpin, as explained there explicitly. (This is why it is only in the <i>Idra Zuta</i> that Abba and Imma are mentioned, since their role is to transfer the influence descending from Arich Anpin to Zeir Anpin.)
<b>…together with the other repairs relating to their functions…</b> The other repairs mentioned there together with their functions are all bound up with the mitigation of stern judgments.<b> …in increasing the strength of Kindness.</b> They all serve to increase the strength of Kindness, for they are nothing but forces of mitigation.
<b>But in connection with the generation of Zeir Anpin we reckon Three Heads – the Crown, the Cavity and the Brain – and all the other repairs that generate repairs in Zeir Anpin.</b> For they are reckoned not on account of what they are in themselves but because they generate repairs in Zeir Anpin. (The Three Heads do not follow the intrinsic essence of Arich Anpin but serve to generate the attributes of Kindness, Judgment and Mercy in Zeir Anpin, which is the governmental order of Justice.)

Chapter 96

<big><strong>Atik and Arich Anpin link Atzilut with Adam Kadmon (Openings 96-100)</strong></big>
<i>Atik Yomin is clothed in Arich Anpin; Atzilut is under Adam Kadmon.</i>
<b>Atik Yomin is clothed in Arich Anpin in order to strengthen Arich in all its Sefirot through the Balance that is rooted in the Unknown Head. In this respect Arich Anpin stands under the rule of Adam Kadmon through the latter’s Yesod and Malchut, for this is the way MaH and BaN were established under them. This is the essential underlying governmental order that progressively brings complete perfection.</b>
<i>Following our discussion of Arich Anpin’s modes of government, we will now give a full explanation of the various aspects of Arich Anpin in themselves. First we will discuss how in all aspects Arich Anpin is governed by Atik Yomin.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts.<b> Part 1: Atik Yomin is clothed…</b> This explains the concept of Atik Yomin being clothed in Arich Anpin.<b> Part 2: In this respect…</b> This explains in what respect Atzilut is said to be <i>under</i> Adam Kadmon.
<b>Part 1: Atik Yomin is clothed in Arich Anpin in order to strengthen Arich in all its Sefirot…</b> For obviously one who is clothed in and acts through another directs that other – the “garment” – to some goal suited to a unique capability possessed by the wearer of the garment. Thus Atik Yomin is clothed in all the Sefirot of Arich Anpin, and the purpose is to bind them all under the hidden root that, as we have explained, underlies the governmental order – the Unknown Head.
<b>…through the Balance that is rooted in the Unknown Head.</b> It is this Head that must rule in order to arrange the repair of all aspects relating to male and female in Atzilut in a way that will eventually bring all damage back to a state of repair.
<b>Part 2: In this respect Arich Anpin stands under the rule of Adam Kadmon… </b>Here we are saying that Adam Kadmon is above, while Atzilut is below the legs of Adam Kadmon (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar</i> 3, <i>Seder Atzilut</i>). However, we said earlier that Atzilut is the <i>radiance</i> of Adam Kadmon (Opening 32). If that is the case, why do we say that Atzilut is <i>under</i> Adam Kadmon? (Why is Atzilut not said to be <i>in front</i> of Adam Kadmon, since it emerges from the radiance emitting from the face of Adam Kadmon through the Ears, Nose, Mouth and Eyes?)
The answer is that although in terms of its emergence in the developmental chain Atzilut is not under Adam Kadmon, in terms of governmental control Atzilut is indeed under Adam Kadmon. A major principle on all the different levels is that the order of the developmental chain is one thing whereas the actual order of government follows a different arrangement. Thus we find that the Sefirot as manifested in the form of circles (עיגולים, <i>igulim</i>) emerge from and stand under one another. (For example, the circle of Gevurah emerges from and stands “under” – within – the circle of Chessed.) Yet in the governmental order, Chessed, Gevurah and Tiferet stand in a row in spite of the fact that in the chain of development they stand one under the other. The same principle applies throughout the Kabbalistic teachings.<br> In the case under discussion, Atzilut is said to stand <i>under</i> Adam Kadmon because it stands under and is subject to the governmental rule of Adam Kadmon through the latter’s Yesod and Malchut. (In terms of the chain of development Atzilut emerges from the branches of Adam Kadmon – i.e. from the radiance of Adam Kadmon’s face – but in terms of the governmental order, Atzilut stands under Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon and is governed by them.)
<b>…through the latter’s Yesod and Malchut…</b> The influence that Yesod of Adam Kadmon sends to its Malchut afterwards passes down through the chain of development to Atzilut. Likewise the interaction between this Yesod and Malchut causes movement – i.e. governmental action – in Atzilut.
<b>…for this is the way MaH and BaN were established under them.</b> The way Atzilut is ruled derives from the mystery of the Balance that I have discussed – the interconnection of MaH and BaN, which is the foundation of the repair of the Partzufim. In other words, the interconnection of MaH and BaN rules over all of Atzilut, and in this respect Atzilut is <i>under</i> Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon, for it is here that the repair of this aspect is rooted.
Thus we are saying that by clothing itself in Arich Anpin, Atik Yomin strengthens Arich in the aspect of Balance. This would not have come about through the chain of development (because in terms of where it emerges, Atzilut is the radiance of the face of Adam Kadmon). One unique power is needed to bring the various aspects of Arich Anpin under the repair effected through the Balance. (The function of Atik Yomin is to bind the government of Arich Anpin, which is conducted through the Partzufim of Atzilut, under the rule of Adam Kadmon. Atik Yomin thus serves as the link between the World of Work – Atzilut – and the World of Reward – Adam Kadmon.)
<b>This is the essential underlying governmental order that progressively brings complete perfection.</b> As you have already heard, the different interconnections between MaH and BaN repair all damage and deficiency. Accordingly this is the essential underlying governmental order, and it is therefore necessary for Arich Anpin to stand under and be subject to it in all aspects. (Through the rule of Mazal – the Unknown Head – the overall service required of man is divided and allocated among the different souls according to what is needed to repair the damage, and the reward is measured accordingly.)<br> (To summarize: All the Partzufim of Atzilut stand under the rule of Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon in order to be governed in accordance with the repair instituted through the Balance, i.e. the repair of male and female through the interconnections of MaH and BaN. Therefore Arich Anpin, the root Partzuf of Atzilut, clothes the seven lower Sefirot of Atik, which are governed through the Balance rooted in the Unknown Head – the first three Sefirot of Atik. The seven lower Sefirot of Atik are thus governed according to the principle of right and left, which are rooted respectively in Yesod and Malchut of Adam Kadmon. However, in terms of the developmental chain, Atzilut emerges from the branches of Adam Kadmon, i.e. from the radiance of the face of Adam Kadmon.)

Chapter 97

<i>The connection between Adam Kadmon, Atik and Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah</i>
<b>From Atzilut and downwards everything follows the nature of the governmental order of This World, in which things revolve until they reach perfect beneficence. However, from Atik and above everything is as it will be in eternity. Atik is in the middle, carrying over from one governmental mode to another. Adam Kadmon comprises the entirety of all existence at all times.</b>
<i>Until now we have been discussing three levels that comprise everything: (1) Adam Kadmon; (2) Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah; (3) Atik – the link in the middle. We must now explain the purpose of these three levels.</i>
<b>From Atzilut and downwards everything follows the nature of the governmental order of This World…</b> The government of This World is founded on the mystery of good and evil, which involves reward and punishment. This governmental order constitutes the entire cycle of the wheel, which goes to reveal the unity to perfection.
<b>…in which things revolve until they reach perfect beneficence.</b> It is clear and evident that the nature and purpose of the laws and institutions from Atzilut and below involve aspects that fall within the category of good and bad, repair and deficiency, advancing in a way intended to bring everything to perfection in the end. Rooted here are all aspects of man’s service.
<b>However, from Atik and above…</b> The lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth.
<b>…everything is as it will be in eternity </b>– from the seventh millennium and onwards. For these millennia are all called eternity since there will be no more death. However, within this period one must distinguish between the time of ascents, which is up to the tenth millennium, when they reach the lights of AV, and the time of eternity, after things are firmly fixed. This will be for ever and for all eternity. (See <i>Daat Tevunot</i> pp. 253-5.)
<b>Atik is in the middle, carrying over from one governmental mode to another.</b> In order for the deeds of the present time to have their effect in the eternity that is afterwards, there must be one level in the middle that takes the deeds from this world and brings them to where they determine aspects of the destined ascents in time to come.
<b>Adam Kadmon comprises the entirety of all existence at all times.</b> Adam Kadmon does not follow as a step or level after any light, because all the lights are branches of Adam Kadmon, and the ascents of the lights are from one radiation of Adam Kadmon to another (i.e. in the branches of Adam Kadmon – the Ears, Nose and Mouth. However, Adam Kadmon makes no ascents).
One could ask how it can possibly be that the order is Atik over Atzilut and the Ears, Nose and Mouth over Atik if Atik is Malchut of Adam Kadmon – surely Adam Kadmon must be set over Atik! (For as Malchut of Adam Kadmon, Atik is a part of Adam Kadmon and not in the same category as the lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth, which are only <i>radiations</i> emanating from Adam Kadmon.)
And if Adam Kadmon is not in the same category as the emanating lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth, then Atik too, which is Malchut of Adam Kadmon, is also not in the same category as those lights. (Atik is not in the same category as the branches – the lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth – but a part of Adam Kadmon. If so, how can Atik be under the Ears, Nose and Mouth? Atik should be under Adam Kadmon as Adam Kadmon’s lowest part.)
The answer is that when Malchut of Adam Kadmon becomes Atik, it also stands level with the branches inasmuch as MaH and BaN are joined together in Atik, and they are branches, as explained earlier.<br> (In other words, Malchut of Adam Kadmon in terms of its role in governing Atzilut – which is why it clothes itself in Arich Anpin – becomes the Partzuf of Atik. In this role it too is built of MaH and BaN, which are radiations from Adam Kadmon, even though as Malchut of Adam Kadmon it is in the category of Adam Kadmon. The difficulty may also be resolved in the light of the teaching in <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar</i> 3, <i>Seder Atzilut</i> that only sparks of Malchut of Adam Kadmon are clothed in Atzilut.)

Chapter 98

<i>Atik elevates man’s service to the World of Reward.</i>
<b>Until MaH and BaN everything proceeded in a state of repair and no delay was necessary there. But the damage was in BaN and its repair is through MaH, and they had to be given a place in which to do what is in their power – until they return to a level beyond that of the worlds, while the level of existence of the lower creations will be raised successively higher and higher through the mystery of the branches of Adam Kadmon, until the end of all ascents.</b>
<b>Therefore, since Atik is the foundation of the interconnection of MaH and Ban, it is Atik that stands to transfer things from this present governmental order to the governmental order of eternity. For every deed by man below has an effect on the interconnection of MaH and BaN and goes on to be fixed for eternity. When all the work of the lower creations is completed, everything necessary in the interconnection of MaH and BaN will be complete and what is necessary will be fixed for all eternity according to the deeds performed by man. Thus we see that everything is in the merit of man below and in accordance with his deeds.</b>
The proposition consists of two parts.<b> Part 1: Until…</b> The place of service is from Atzilut and below. <b>Part 2: Therefore, since…</b> How the service ascends to eternity, which is the level of the reward.
<b>Part 1: Until MaH and BaN…</b> The phenomena of breaking and repair are found only in BaN. For even though there was a certain aspect of concealment on the level of the Akudim (the lights of the Mouth of Adam Kadmon), this was not because of any breakage. Rather, it was a process brought about in order that it would afterwards be possible for the breakage to occur in the Nekudim (see Opening 33).
<b>…everything proceeded in a state of repair…</b> Evil was not rooted there and accordingly there was nothing to hold back the radiation. <b>…and no delay was necessary there.</b> As soon as the process began it was completed at once, for such is the nature of that level. (This comes to explain why only one thousand years each are required for the ascents to the Eyes, Nose and Mouth of Adam Kadmon while the repair of BaN requires six thousand years, as discussed further below.)
<b>But the damage was in BaN and its repair is through MaH…</b> Here things take longer because the work necessary on this level cannot be completed all at once. First there was the damage, which made it necessary for man to come afterwards and complete the repair of these defects.
<b>…and they had to be given a place in which to do what is in their power…</b> This is the whole concept of the six thousand years of the existence of this world. <b>…until they return to a level beyond that of the worlds...</b> i.e. beyond the level of the worlds of Atzilut-Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. For the lower realms were created with an aspect of damage and defect deriving from BaN, and completion of this branch is delayed until after the creation of evil and the creation of the lower worlds – until evil is repaired by the lower creations, this being their service. This branch (BaN) will then be complete and return to a state of repair like the other branches of Adam Kadmon (the Ears, Nose and Mouth and above).
<b>…while the level of existence of the lower creations will be raised successively higher and higher through the mystery of the branches of Adam Kadmon, until the end of all ascents.</b> (This refers to the period from the seventh millennium to the tenth and thereafter to eternity.) While it is true that the lower creations emerged from this lowest branch (BaN), they must rise up to all the branches (i.e. those of AV and SaG – the lights of the Ears, Nose and Mouth). For all those branches were successive levels required to produce the lower realms (through the developmental chain that consists of all the branches of Adam Kadmon down to BaN, for each branch develops out of the preceding branch). All of them must act to influence the lower creations until everything made for their sake has carried out its allotted task. (For the branches of the Ears, Nose and Mouth were also made for the sake of the lower creations – to perfect them in the World of Reward.)
Thus the lower creations came into being only through the lowest branch – BaN – and they therefore had to descend level by level down to there. Then man came forth to perform his service, after which, in the World of Reward, he will receive successive influences, one after the other, from all the branches that came forth for his sake – the Ears, Nose and Mouth. What will they do for him? They will elevate his plane of existence. For he exists already, but the <i>plane</i> of his existence will be qualitatively purer, higher and better. When all these ascents are complete, it can be said that each of the branches of Adam Kadmon will have carried out its allotted task in the repair of the lower creations that developed from them.
The branches of the Ears, Nose and Mouth have a different function from that of BaN and their effect on the lower creations is different. BaN, the lowest branch, included all the defects we have discussed in connection with the breaking of the vessels, with two results. Firstly, this is what provided man with his service, because it was the need to repair the defects that created the possibility of service. Secondly, the repair is protracted – it takes six thousand years. However the function of the other branches – the Ears, Nose and Mouth – is only to raise the lower creations to ever greater levels of perfection (and the time needed for the ascent in each case is only one thousand years). Initially the lower creations are subject to the mode of government of this lowest branch. Afterwards they will be governed through the part above it, then through the next higher part, each reaching its fitting level, and this is the order of the levels.
Thus the existence of the lower creations will only attain its necessary level of perfection after all the ascents in the tenth millennium. From then on is eternity, of which we have no conception whatever. The creation will then already have been totally perfected, having completed all ascents.
Thus we see that while the lowest branch functioned to give the lower creations the opportunity of service, the other branches – which require no repair – do not provide any possibility of service but rather give radiance and delight in proportion to the merit already attained through the earlier service.<br> (Summary of Part 1: (1) The ascents to the Ears, Nose and Mouth require only one thousand years in each case whereas the complete repair of the branches of MaH and BaN takes six thousand years. This is because in the Ears, Nose and Mouth there is no evil to delay their repair, which is not so in the case of MaH and BaN. (2) Just as the branches of BaN emerged through the chain of development from those of the Ears, Nose and Mouth, so the Ears, Nose and Mouth bring completion to the lower creations when they ascend to them in the World of Reward. This is how the Ears, Nose and Mouth fulfill their function.)
<b>Part 2: Therefore, since Atik is the foundation of the interconnection of MaH and Ban…</b> For the essence of Atik is the Balance, as discussed earlier (Opening 59 Part 1 and Opening 96 end).
<b>…it is Atik that stands to transfer things from this present governmental order to the governmental order of eternity.</b> Why is Atik said to be the conveyor that makes the transfer between the affairs of this world and eternity? The reason is that all the affairs of this world depend on the mystery of MaH and BaN and their repair, which provided man with the possibility of service. The radiance shines to him afterwards from the supreme branches in proportion to the repair carried out by man. Since Atik is the very foundation of the interconnection of MaH and BaN, being entirely built of all their different aspects, Atik is bound up with man’s service in the sense of determining the reward. This is why Atik is said to be the conveyor or transmitter from one governmental order to another – from that of the period of work to that of the period of reward, as the proposition goes on to explain.
<b>For every deed by man below has an effect on the interconnection of MaH and BaN and goes on to be fixed for eternity.</b> I have already explained that man’s deeds below bring about the repair above, and the repair is only in MaH and BaN. However its effect does not end there. That would have been the case had there been no reward except in this world. However the main reward will be in the World to Come, after we pass from the government of MaH and BaN to the government of the other branches – those of SaG followed by those of AV. If so, the other branches must be affected by this service – not in the sense of being rectified, since they do not need repair, but rather in the sense that they radiate afterwards in proportion to the repair carried out below, which makes the receiver fit to receive.
One level is therefore necessary in order to take these repairs – which were originally acts of service rectifying Atzilut and its branches – and transfer them to a plane on which there are no more repairs since no more are needed, but where the repairs already carried out elicit the radiation of the eternal reward that will be given when the branches of AV and SaG rule. The level that accomplishes this transfer is Atik, which is outside the world but stands as head to the world. (The first three Sefirot of Atik are not clothed in Atzilut and thus Atik in its intrinsic essence is beyond Atzilut but stands as head over it.) At the same time Atik, as Malchut of Adam Kadmon, is also connected with what is above it. (As head of Atzilut, Atik relates to the world of service, while as Malchut of Adam Kadmon, Atik has the power to transfer the service to the World of Reward – in the sense of fixing the measure of the reward for each repair.) This is how Atik accomplishes this transfer.
<b>When all the work of the lower creations is completed…</b> The truth is that when the time of service is complete, it means that the time of the repair of all the levels (including the branches of AV and SaG) are complete. For even though the upper branches require no actual repair, man has to be repaired in the sense of being fit to receive their lights through merit and not as a gift of charity, for this was the original intention. (The upper levels are repaired through the repair of the receiver, because only then is the giver able to influence the receiver.)
Thus the actual repair in MaH and BaN brought about through man’s deeds elicits a corresponding radiation of the lights of the other branches, and accordingly when those lights shine it will be through merit, since their radiation was elicited through man’s merit during his repair of MaH and BaN. Thus the time of man’s service is only during the rule of MaH and BaN, but the effects of this service reach the very summit of all levels until the entire repair of MaH and BaN will be complete. Thus it is man’s merit that calls forth each of these levels – the Ears, Nose and Mouth – to shine their lights in turn, each in its proper time (in its respective millennium).
<b>…everything necessary in the interconnection of MaH and BaN will be complete and what is necessary will be fixed for all eternity according to the deeds performed by man. </b>The end effect reaches eternity in the way explained above.
<b>Thus we see that everything is in the merit of man below and in accordance with his deeds.</b> This is what it all comes down to in the end: the intention is that everything should be attained through merit and not through charity.

Chapter 99

<i>Transfer of man’s deeds to the World of Reward through Daat of Atik</i>
<b>The Unknown Head – foundation of the interconnections of MaH and BaN above – is the source of the entire governmental order. The seven lower Sefirot of Atik, which are clothed in Arich Anpin, govern the latter according to the nature of the Head that is above. Daat of Atik, which is clothed between the Crown and Brain of Arich Anpin, stands to receive the deeds of men under the present governmental order and transfers them through the Unknown Head to the levels above to be fixed for eternity.</b>
<i>Having discussed how all these aspects are bound up with the mystery of the present governmental order and that of eternity, we will now present a summary of all the levels that exist to connect the two.</i>
<b>The Unknown Head – foundation of the interconnections of MaH and BaN above – is the source of the entire governmental order.</b> This states what I discussed above (Openings 85 &amp; 96): the source of the governmental order that rules during the six thousand years of the duration of this world lies in the mystery of the interconnection of MaH and BaN, which is rooted in the Unknown Head. (The first connection of MaH and BaN is in the Unknown Head, and this is the source of all their interconnections in building the Partzufim of Atzilut, which make up the governmental order of the six thousand years.)
<b>The seven lower Sefirot of Atik, which are clothed in Arich Anpin, govern the latter according to the nature of the Head that is above.</b> As discussed earlier, the purpose is to bind the government of Atzilut under this governmental order founded on the interconnections of MaH and BaN in order to stand under Adam Kadmon.
<b>Daat of Atik, which is clothed between the Crown and Brain of Arich Anpin…</b> The ARI of blessed memory taught that Daat of Atik is hidden (גנוז, <i>ganuz</i>) in the Cavity (אווירא, <i>avira</i> – see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i> ch. 6). This means that it is not clothed in the same way as the other seven Sefirot but rather, it is hidden there. The difference is as follows. When something is said to be clothed, it means that the wearer of the clothing keeps hold of the governmental power exercised by the clothing. However, when something is said to be hidden away, it means that it is separate from the essential functioning of the clothing but has some other purpose, as the proposition goes on to state.
<b>…stands to receive the deeds of men under the present governmental order…</b> In other words, its purpose is not to control and direct the governmental order of Arich Anpin but rather to receive what there is to receive from this governmental order and bring it to the Head, which is the true conveyer to eternity through the mystery of its uncertainties. As discussed earlier, in the Unknown Head, all things are supervised in accordance with everything past, present and future. Thus Daat stands and receives all aspects of Arich Anpin, and from there they ascend to pass under the supervision of the Unknown Head, from there to be fixed in eternity.
<b>…and transfers them through the Unknown Head to the levels above to be fixed for eternity.</b>

Chapter 100

<i>The way one power clothes itself in another indicates how the wearer directs the garb, but the underlying reasons are beyond comprehension.</i>
<b>Differences in the extent to which one power clothes itself in another in every place where this occurs indicate whether the action of the wearer is greater or lesser. The degree of action always remains proportional to the extent of the parts of the wearer that are clothed. The fact that in one place a large part of the wearer is clothed whereas in another place only a small part is clothed indicates that the action in one place is greater than the action in the other place in exact proportion to the extent of the parts of the wearer clothed by the garment in each case. However, as to the reason for the degree of action in any given case – it is because this is what the overall purpose requires. Various reasons could be found for the particular degree of action in any given case, because this has ramifications in various spheres.</b>
<i>In order to complete our explanation of the link between the present governmental order and that of eternity it would be necessary to explain in detail how Atik is clothed in Arich Anpin – why Keter, Chochmah and Binah of Arich each clothe one whole Sefirah of Atik (Chessed, Gevurah and Tiferet respectively) while Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet-Netzach-Hod-Yesod of Arich in each case clothe only certain parts or limbs of the Sefirot of Netzach-Hod-Yesod-Malchut of Atik clothed within them (see </i>Mevo Shearim<i> 3:2:2). This is what we will now explain through a general introduction relating to all aspects of the phenomenon whereby one power clothes itself in another.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: Differences…</b> This is a fundamental premise relating to clothing.<b> Part 2: However, as to the reason… </b>This is a qualification with regard to this premise.
<b>Part 1: Differences in the extent to which one power clothes itself in another in every place where this occurs…</b> Just as there is a difference in the way the Sefirot of Atik Yomin divide up when they clothe themselves in the Sefirot of Arich Anpin, as explained above, similarly in other places too there are differences in the way the different Partzufim clothe themselves in one another. This premise applies everywhere.
<b>…indicate whether the action of the wearer is greater or lesser.</b> Clearly the concept of one power clothing itself in another indicates action: the wearer acts through the garment. If a major part of the wearer is clothed, this certainly indicates that major action is required, whereas if only a small part is clothed, this indicates that less action is required.
<b>The degree of action always remains proportional to the extent of the parts of the wearer that are clothed. The fact that in one place a large part of the wearer is clothed whereas in another place only a small part is clothed indicates that the action in one place is greater than the action in the other place…</b>
We must always compare one garment to another in terms of which one clothes a greater part and will therefore be subject to greater action than one that clothes a small part. Moreover, through this principle we can understand in great detail how the various powers are clothed differently in one another. When we want to make a precise measurement of the power of the action of the higher Partzuf, we measure which limbs or parts of a limb are clothed in the lower Partzuf and their characteristics and we then understand the quality of the action. (The quality of the action depends not only on how much of the wearer is clothed but also on which limb or part of a limb – i.e. which Sefirah or part of a Sefirah – is clothed.)
<b>…in exact proportion to the extent of the parts of the wearer clothed by the garment in each case.</b>
<b>Part 2: However, as to the reason for the degree of action in any given case – it is because this is what the overall purpose requires.</b> There is no need to look for a reason for this, for as discussed earlier (see Openings 14 &amp;15), we do not seek the reason for everything that exists in the overall structure. On the contrary, if we see that this is the way the structure is, we may infer that this is what is necessary, and afterwards we will be able to gain a better understanding of the nature of the building through application of our present premise. When we understand which parts of the wearer are clothed in which parts of the clothing, we can then infer the reason why the structure is so. The structure itself is something handed down by tradition in all its measurements and from it derives the entire governmental order.
Indeed, we could find many valid reasons for these structures, but this is not our intention. Rather, it is to know what exists and its function in each case and what depends on the degree and quality of the action – which parts of the garment clothe which parts of the wearer. And we will understand that the particular degree of action requires specific differences in the way one power clothes another. (Differences in the mode of government of the outer garb compared to that of the inner wearer are determined by the extent to which the one clothes the other.) From the fact that a particular light is great we can infer that it has to be so, because a major action is needed. (Thus <i>Mevo Shearim</i> ibid. explains that the Head of Arich needs greater light than the body, and therefore each of the Sefirot of the Head of Arich clothes an entire Sefirah of Atik.) If the light is small, it is because only a minor action is needed. It is sufficient if we understand this, because the wisdom lies in knowing what is the effect of this and what is the function of that – not the reason why it has to be specifically this way.
<b>Various reasons could be found for the particular degree of action in any given case, because this has ramifications in various spheres.</b> This is not among the things it is forbidden to ask. On the contrary, we could find many reasons, and all of them could be true. For the Supreme Thought did not have only one intention but many – except that we have no need to investigate this at all, but only to understand “what”. For example, when we say that Zeir Anpin starts from the chest of Abba and Imma, it simply means that this is how it is: this is the extent to which Zeir Anpin clothes Abba and Imma – from there and below – and all the aspects of the world that depend on this follow the same order. But if you ask why Zeir Anpin does not start from Daat and below, this is not a question. Even if you could find an answer, the inner reason would remain unknown. As we have said already, the Supreme Thought had various intentions and we have no need to investigate them but only to know what He laid down and built, and the effects of the structure as it stands.<br> (It is permissible to investigate how one power is clothed in another because this teaches us about the functioning of the governmental order of this world, which relates to man’s service. However, it is forbidden to investigate the reasons for the present governmental order. This is because the World of Service exists in order to attain the reward, and therefore the reasons for its governmental order lie rooted in the World of Reward – the world of perfection – of which we can have no conception.)

<big><strong>The Repairs of Arich Anpin (Openings 101-109)</strong></big>
<i>The Head includes the Crown – Keter – and the Mental Powers within it.</i>
<b>The Head is always the beginning of the entire government of the Partzuf, and is only complete with the Crown (Keter) and the Mental Powers (</b>מוחין<b>, mochin) within it – that is, through the mystery of the indwelling of the one above it, which rests upon it. Included in the Head are the three Mental Powers of the Partzuf, because that is where the whole birth of the governmental order of the Partzuf in essence takes place.</b>
<i>We now come to a detailed explanation of the form of the Partzufim, starting with a general rule.</i>
This proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: The Head is always…</b> This defines the Head of a Partzuf.<b> Part 2: …that is, through the mystery…</b> This explains the above premise.
<b>Part 1: The Head is always the beginning of the entire government of the Partzuf…</b> The Head itself includes everything that exists in the entire Partzuf – but in the form of a beginning (ראשית, <i>reishit</i>). This is why it is called the Head (ראש, <i>rosh</i>), while the function of the Head is completed through the rest of the Partzuf (see Opening 90).
<b>…and is only complete with the Crown (Keter) and the Mental Powers (מוחין, <i>mochin</i>) within it…</b> These are two distinct aspects both of which are needed in order for the Partzuf to exercise its governmental power. The crown, Keter, is one kind while the mental powers are another.
<b>Part 2:  …that is, through the mystery of the indwelling of the one above it, which rests upon it.</b> For there must be a superior power that governs the lower one, as distinct from the lower power itself in all its attributes. The crown, Keter, is the superior power. (Keter reflects the governmental mode of the Partzuf above).
<b>Included in the Head are the three Mental Powers of the Partzuf…</b> These encompass all the attributes of the lower Partzuf. (The three Mental Powers contain the roots of the governmental power exercised by the lower Partzuf, because Chochmah-Binah-Daat are the roots of Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet.)
<b>…because that is where the whole birth of the governmental order of the Partzuf in essence takes place.</b> It is through the ingathering of all these powers on the level of Chochmah-Binah-Daat that the governmental order of the Partzuf is born, and from the Head it extends through the entire Partzuf.

Chapter 102

<i>Atik shines in the Head of Arich Anpin through the Seven Repairs of the Head – in the Skull in general, in the Face in detail.</i>
<b>By the Head of Arich Anpin is meant Kitra, the Crown, and Chochmah S’tima’ah, the Concealed Wisdom contained within it – this is in terms of what is attributed to Arich Anpin’s own intrinsic mode of government. The Seven Repairs of the Head are found in Arich Anpin, and this is because the entire government of Arich Anpin depends upon Atik. For this reason the seven lower Sefirot of Atik rule in the Head of Arich Anpin through the various particular repairs therein deriving from Atik. In the Skull they function generally, while in the Face they operate in detail, because the Face is made to shine in detail and all its radiations must be rectified through the repairs deriving from Atik.</b>
<i>Having explained the concept of the head in general terms, we will now discuss the specific arrangements or “repairs” (תיקונים, </i>tikkunim<i>) found in the Head of Arich Anpin, which is our present focus.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: By the Head of Arich Anpin…</b> This explains what we mean when we speak about the Seven Repairs of the Head. <b>Part 2: In the Skull…</b> This gives more details about these Repairs.
<b>Part 1: By the Head of Arich Anpin is meant Kitra, the Crown, and Chochmah S’tima’ah, the Concealed Wisdom contained within it …</b> For the head consists not only of the skull but of the entire head and face and what is contained within them. In the case of Arich Anpin, Binah is not in the head (for Binah descended to the throat – see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar HaMelachim</i> ch. 8; <i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i> ch. 8). Accordingly, when we speak of the Head of Arich Anpin, this means Keter and Chochmah within it together with all that spreads forth from them in the mystery of the Face.
<b>…this is in terms of what is attributed to Arich Anpin’s own intrinsic mode of government.</b> As discussed earlier (in Opening 95), Kindness, Judgment and Mercy are attributed to Arich Anpin as the root of Zeir Anpin (and in this aspect we speak of the Three Heads of Arich Anpin – see further in Opening 104). However in terms of Arich Anpin’s own intrinsic essence – total Kindness – the only way they divide up is in terms of the Skull and the Brain. (The Skull and the Brain are called two heads of Arich Anpin, and later, with the Cavity, אווירא, <i>avira</i>, these become the Three Heads – <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i> ch. 3.)
<b>The Seven Repairs of the Head are found in Arich Anpin, and this is because the entire government of Arich Anpin depends upon Atik…</b> As you have already heard, the purpose of Atik is to bind all the Sefirot of Arich Anpin under Adam Kadmon and maintain them in the state of Balance. (This is through the Head of Atik, which contains the initial interconnection of MaH and BaN – see Opening 96.)
<b>For this reason the seven lower Sefirot of Atik rule in the Head of Arich Anpin through the various particular repairs therein deriving from Atik.</b> It is in the place where they first rule – in the Head – that this repair must be carried out, and it then extends to the entire Partzuf.
<b>Part 2: In the Skull they function generally…</b> This is the mystery of the White Skull – for these seven repairs divide up into one in the Skull and six in the Face. The underlying principle behind this is that it is not in the nature of Keter to divide up its lights in detail in the same way as Chochmah. For the mystery of Keter is that of closure, as signified by its associated vowel, <i>kametz</i> (קָמֶץ), which has the connotation of being closed up – like the skull, which is a closed circle. Chochmah, on the other hand, signified by the vowel <i>patach</i> (פַתַח) having the connotation of openness, produces all the lights of the Face in their individual details. Accordingly, the repairs generated by Atik in Arich Anpin follow the respective natures of (1) the Skull (Keter), where the repair is one overall whole (for the skull clothes Chessed of Atik, which includes all the Sefirot below it) and (2) the Face, where the repairs are seen in all their specific details. Thus the proposition goes on to state:
<b>…while in the Face they operate in detail, because the Face is made to shine in detail and all its radiations must be rectified through the repairs deriving from Atik.</b> The intention is to rectify everything. Accordingly the individual parts cannot be left out. Wherever there are detailed aspects, they must all be repaired. (Atik repairs the Head of Arich Anpin overall through the repair of the Skull and all the details individually through the repairs of the Face.)<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE</small></b></sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Etz Chayim Shaar Arich Anpin</i> ch. 6: “The seven lower Sefirot of the Unknown Head from Chessed to Malchut are clothed in the two lower heads of Arich Anpin and shine therein”. See ibid. ch. 7: “Although we have said that Atik’s seven lower Sefirot are clothed in the seven Sefirot of the Skull of Arich Anpin, nevertheless… in essence there are only two in the head of Arich Anpin: Chessed and Gevurah. Chessed is in the Skull and Gevurah in the Brain, for the Skull and Brain are the two lower heads and they are the roots of the entire Head, while the other Sefirot – revealed through the Seven Repairs of the Head – are merely a radiation. See Ramchal, <i>Klalut HaIlan</i> 7:8 and 8:3.</i>

Chapter 103

<i>Revelation of the Forehead of Favor completely removes stern Judgment; when it is concealed, the Judgment is sweetened.</i>
<b>The purpose of all aspects of Arich Anpin is to strengthen Kindness and sweeten Judgment. There is also a revelation of Arich Anpin’s power with particular force that removes Judgment altogether. This is when the Forehead of Favor is revealed.</b>
<i>Further to our discussion of the Seven Repairs of the Head, we will now discuss the difference between them.</i>
<b>The purpose of all aspects of Arich Anpin…</b> We have already discussed how Arich Anpin brings about a sweetening of Zeir Anpin’s stern judgments (see Opening 94). <b>…is to strengthen Kindness and sweeten Judgment…</b> It is the right side of Arich Anpin – the male aspect – that gives sway to Kindness so that Judgment does not operate, while the left side – the female aspect – sweetens Judgment with Kindness.
<b>There is also a revelation of Arich Anpin’s power with particular force that removes Judgment altogether…</b> This depends on whether the Forehead is revealed or not. (In Hebrew, forehead is מצחא, <i>mitzcha</i>, related to the root צחה, <i>tzachah</i>, “shine brightly”, cf. Opening 32). When this Forehead is concealed, Judgment is only sweetened, whereas when it is revealed it removes Judgment altogether.
<b>This is when the Forehead of Favor is revealed</b>. This is the mystery of the Repair of the Will of Wills (תיקון דרעוא דרעוין, <i>tikkun derava deravin</i>). This is what gives Arich Anpin this particular power. (For Yesod of Atik is clothed in the Forehead of Atik.) None of the other Repairs, which stem from Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach and Hod of Atik, achieve this because none of them except Yesod has the power to rectify the Forehead in such a way that the powers of Kindness can be revealed with great force.

Chapter 104

<i>The entire governmental order depends on the Three Heads – the root of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy – and the Unknown Head – the root of the Receiver.</i>
<b>The entire governmental order of Justice is based on Kindness-Judgment-Mercy and the Receiver thereof, because this is the foundation of the whole concept of reward and punishment. At the root of all this we find the division into the Three Heads in Arich Anpin, while the Unknown Head, which is above them, is the root of the Receiver – the Shechinah, the Indwelling Presence.</b>
<i>Having discussed Arich Anpin’s own intrinsic governmental mode as expressed in the Seven Repairs of the Head, we will now examine how Arich Anpin serves as the root of Zeir Anpin. (The Three Heads are the Skull and Brain, as discussed in Opening 102, and the Cavity, אווירא, </i>avira<i>, in between, which clothes Daat of Atik.)</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The entire governmental order… </b>This is an introductory premise about the governmental order. <b>Part 2: At the root…</b> This discusses the Three Heads in Arich Anpin accordingly.
<b>Part 1: The entire governmental order of Justice is based on Kindness-Judgment-Mercy and the Receiver thereof…</b> By Receiver we are referring to the Nukva, the Female aspect, which is the root of the receivers – the lower creations. For according to their level of preparedness, so the Nukva is ready to receive, as discussed earlier (see Opening 58). <b>…because this is the foundation of the whole concept of reward and punishment.</b> Justice does not only mean Judgment alone. Justice involves Kindness, Judgment and Mercy – to do what is fitting in the eyes of the Judge (i.e. to administer reward and punishment as necessary, and thus the government of justice is that of reward and punishment).
<b>Part 2: At the root of all this we find the division into the Three Heads in Arich Anpin…</b> As discussed earlier, the very governmental order based on Justice itself derives from Arich Anpin.
<b>…while the Unknown Head, which is above them, is the root of the Receiver…</b> This is the mystery of “A woman of valor is the crown of her husband” (Proverbs 12:4). <b>…the Shechinah, the Indwelling Presence.</b> This is the power of the Shechinah, which is called “a stone cast up to Eyn Sof” – for the Shechinah was first in thought, while the attributes – the other nine Sefirot – were drawn forth only for the sake of the Shechinah through the columns of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy. (Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet are the root of the Sefirot of Justice while Chochmah-Binah-Daat come only to <i>add</i> to the flow of influence and Netzach-Hod-Yesod to <i>transfer</i> it).
Thus, the entire repair is in the hands of the receivers, who reveal the unity through their service. Accordingly this is what was determined first, and afterwards the nine upper attributes were channeled in accordance with the nature of the Shechinah. (The nine Sefirot of Arich Anpin are above Malchut of Atzilut – the Nukva – yet the latter is the root of the government of the lower creations, which are the very purpose of the creation. This Malchut is therefore rooted in the exalted level of the Unknown Head, which is <i>above</i> Arich Anpin.)
Accordingly the entire arousal comes from the Shechinah – in order to benefit the receivers. And the entire repair is dependent upon the Shechinah – as evident in many places in the writings of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. (The repair is when the Holy One, blessed be He, can send a flow of blessing to the receivers because they are ready to receive it.)

Chapter 105

<i>Function of the Hairs of the Head and Beard of Arich Anpin</i>
<b>The Hairs of the Head are a revelation of the holiness of the Brain just as it is within. However, the Beard is such that its lights descend in sequence, level by level, to Zeir Anpin.</b>
<i>Having discussed how Arich Anpin is the root of Zeir Anpin, let us examine the start of this root’s descent.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The Hairs of the Head…</b> This explains the nature of the Hairs of the Head.<b> Part 2: However, the Beard…</b> This explains the nature of the Hairs of the Beard.
<b>Part 1: The Hairs of the Head are a revelation…</b> As the proposition itself states afterwards in Part 2, the Hairs of the Beard are channels that draw the light of Chochmah S’tima’ah – the Concealed Wisdom – to the outside so as to produce the downward chain of development. Yet the Hairs of the Head also draw forth light from the Brain, as stated in the <i>Idra Rabba</i> (129a): “In every strand there is a flow that comes forth from the Concealed Brain”. Accordingly we must first understand the difference between the Hairs of the Beard and those of the Head. The difference is that the Hairs of the Head merely reveal the light of the Brain exactly as it is and not by way of sequential development and gradation. However, the Beard draws the light downwards sequentially, level by level.
<b>…of the holiness of the Brain…</b> The number of strands of hair in the locks of the Head corresponds to the numerical value of the letters of the word קדוש, <i>kadosh</i>, “holy” – 410, as explained by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the <i>Idra Rabba</i> (128b): “Every lock consists of 410 hairs…” This is because it is through the Hairs of the Head that the holiness of the inner Mental Powers flashes forth to be revealed on the outside. <b>…just as it is within.</b> Even when drawn forth, it does not change.
<b>Part 2: However, the Beard is such that its lights descend in sequence, level by level...</b> The reason that the levels of the Beard are enumerated individually (as 13 Repairs corresponding to the 13 Attributes of Mercy) – in contrast to the Hairs of the Head – is because the levels of the Beard are involved in the mystery of the interaction and coupling of the two attributes of Notzer (נוצר), “…Preserver of Kindness…” and Venakeh (ונקה), “…Who cleanses…” (Exodus 34:6). These are the two Mazalot or “Constellations”. (The eighth and thirteenth of the 13 Attributes of Mercy include all the others. “These two Mazalot rest one over the other and are male and female” – <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i> ch. 9.) They interact and couple together, the purpose being to draw down the lights in proportion to the power of the two parties to the interaction. For it is in the brains of the couple that the light emanated through them is drawn down. In this way the light descends to the same level as that of the couple, and it is on this level that the light is emanated.<br> (It is through coupling – זיווג, <i>zivug</i> – that they draw down the light from above. Since it is the two parties in the interaction that draw down the light, what they draw down is on their level, and this is how the developmental chain of the Partzufim descends level by level. In the case under discussion, the two parties in the interaction or coupling are Abba and Imma, which are included under the Mazalot of Notzer and Venakeh respectively, which transfer the lights of the Head of Arich Anpin to Zeir Anpin.)
<b>… to Zeir Anpin.</b> For the function of the Beard is to bring forth the order of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy contained within the Concealed Wisdom to the outside. Once it begins drawing it forth, it is channeled downwards, descending to Zeir Anpin. For this reason, “Abba and Imma are included in Mazal” (i.e. under Notzer and Venakeh, as noted above, in order to provide the governmental order of right and left). This will be discussed further later on. For the purpose of the Beard is to bring this order down to the level of Zeir Anpin. (It is Abba and Imma that effect the transfer.) Accordingly Abba and Imma end at the Navel – the Mazalot of the Beard end at the Navel of Arich Anpin – and this way Abba and Imma are literally over the Head of Zeir Anpin, which starts at the Navel of Arich Anpin.

Chapter 106

<i>Some repairs come to prepare the flow of blessing, others to channel it.</i>
<b>The purpose of the various repairs is in some cases to channel the flow of blessing while in others it is to prepare and rectify the actual flow itself.</b>
<i>This is a general rule that applies to all the different repairs found in the Partzufim. Our purpose here is to understand how it applies to the Repairs of the Beard. (The 13 “Repairs” of the Beard of Arich Anpin – the 13 Attributes of Mercy, as signified by differing arrangements of the hairs in different locations of the beard – are elaborated in the </i>Idra Rabba<i>.)</i>
<b>The purpose of the various repairs…</b> All the different kinds of repairs found in all places fall under one of the following two categories.
<b>…is in some cases to channel the flow of blessing…</b> In the case of the Beard, the repairs that channel the flow of blessing are the Two Mazalot – Notzer, the eighth, and Venakeh, the thirteenth attribute. (“Why is this noble thread – the Beard – called Mazal? Because from it hang constellations and constellations – higher and lower…” – <i>Idra Rabba</i> 134a.) The specific purpose of the Two Mazalot is to draw down and reveal the light of Arich Anpin in Zeir Anpin.
<b>…while in others it is to prepare and rectify the actual flow itself.</b> In the case of the Beard this applies to all the other repairs besides those of Notzer and Venakeh.

Chapter 107

<i>The Beard reveals the governmental order of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy stemming from the Three Heads.</i>
<b>All the Three Heads radiate in the Beard, for the latter is literally the revelation of this governmental order of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy.</b>
<i>Further discussion of the Beard.</i>
<b>All the Three Heads radiate in the Beard…</b> It is stated explicitly in the writings of the ARI of blessed memory that all the Three Heads of Arich Anpin – the Skull, the Hidden Brain and the Cavity – are revealed through the Beard. And why is this necessary? <b>…for the latter is literally the revelation of this governmental order of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy.</b> The whole purpose of the Beard is to reveal the Kindness-Judgment-Mercy rooted in the Three Heads. This is why it is necessary for each of them to radiate in the Beard individually.

Chapter 108

<i>The Beard subdues stern judgments, humbles the husks and gives power to Holiness.</i>
<b>The Beard shows the power of the Partzuf. It is therefore through the Beard that the power of Arich Anpin is revealed, and this subdues the stern judgments and humbles the husks and gives power to Holiness through the supreme unity.</b>
<i>How the Beard subdues stern judgments.</i>
<b>The Beard shows the power of the Partzuf.</b> This is the concept of “the glory of the face is the beard” (<i>Shabbat</i> 152b), and this principle also applies in the lower world.<b> It is therefore through the Beard that the power of Arich Anpin… </b>– which is complete Kindness – <b>…is revealed, and this subdues the stern judgments…</b> The nature of Arich Anpin is to give sway to Kindness, and when Arich Anpin asserts its power, this sweetens and mitigates the stern judgments. <b>…and humbles the husks…</b> For as long as the stern judgments are unmitigated, they give power to the Other Side. But the mitigation of the stern judgments causes the humiliation of the Other Side. (For the Other Side is the agent that executes the stern judgments, and when they are sweetened, there is no need for the Other Side, which is thus humbled.)
<b>…and gives power to Holiness through the supreme unity.</b> This is the future repair that will reign in time to come, of which the sages said: “He is destined to honor the Beard” (<i>Idra Rabba</i> 134b), as it is written: “And God will be exalted alone on that day ” (Isaiah 2:11). And then Holiness alone will rule throughout the world.

Chapter 109

<i>Interrelation of the Partzufim – in the chain of development and through clothing one another</i>
<b>The developmental chain is so arranged that all of Netzach-Hod-Yesod of every upper Partzuf are themselves the mental powers of the Partzuf below it. However, the order whereby the Partzufim are clothed in one another follows a different arrangement.</b>
<i>This distinction makes it possible to resolve an apparent contradiction in the teachings of the ARI of blessed memory. In one place Yesod of Atik is said to end in Yesod of Arich Anpin (</i>Etz Chayim<i>, </i>Shaar Arich Anpin<i> ch. 1). Elsewhere, however, we find that Yesod of Atik ends in Tiferet of Arich Anpin (ibid. </i>Shaar HaMelachim<i> ch. 4). How the seeming contradiction is resolved will be explained in the next Opening.</i>
<b>The developmental chain is so arranged that all of Netzach-Hod-Yesod of every upper Partzuf are themselves the mental powers of the Partzuf below it.</b> As discussed earlier, there are differences in the way the different states of the Partzufim appear in the prophetic vision depending on what the Supreme Will wants to reveal through them. Thus in one aspect the Partzufim are governed one under the other – in the sense that Malchut of the upper Partzuf governs the lower Partzuf. This is called the order of the chain of development (השתלשלות, <i>hishtalshelut</i>). The prophetic vision reveals this aspect by showing how Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the upper Partzuf serve as the mental powers in the lower Partzuf. (For Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the upper Partzuf serve the needs of the lower Partzuf, while Malchut stands behind channeling their influence to the lower Partzuf. In the chain of development, the mental powers thus complete the lower Partzuf by providing its interior soul – <i>pnimiyut</i>.)
However, besides this interrelationship of the Partzufim through the developmental chain, there is another aspect whereby one Partzuf clothes itself within another. The Partzuf that serves as the garb is thus given additional powers besides its own intrinsic power as instituted through the developmental chain. Accordingly there is another state seen in the prophetic vision in which one Partzuf clothes another.
Thus certain aspects of a given Partzuf derive from its intrinsic power as established from the outset through the chain of development. In the prophetic vision, Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the upper Partzuf appear as the mental powers of the lower Partzuf, giving rise to the aspects in question. On the other hand, there are other aspects of the Partzuf that derive from the way it serves to clothe another, and in the vision these appear accordingly as arising out of that state.
<b>However, the order whereby the Partzufim are clothed in one another follows a different arrangement.</b> All these arrangements are found constantly in the Partzufim. Thus when we come to examine their various powers, we must consider the intrinsic power vested in a given Partzuf through the graded chain of development – this being governed by Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the upper Partzuf – and trace all the aspects of the lower Partzuf that derive from this mode of government. In addition, we must take into account how the lower Partzuf clothes and conceals within it certain given levels of the upper Partzuf, providing the lower Partzuf with extra power, and we must trace which aspects derive from this. All the different aspects function as necessary in order to bring the creations to perfection.

Chapter 110

<big><strong>The Partzufim of Abba and Imma (Openings 110-114)</strong></big>
<i>In the chain of development, Yesod of Atik ends in the chest (Tiferet) of Arich Anpin; as clothed, it ends in Yesod of Arich.</i>
<b>According to the way the chain of development is arranged, Yesod of Atik ends in the chest of Arich Anpin and it is from there that its Kindnesses and Strengths go forth and are revealed. Afterwards it is from there that Abba and Imma, Israel Sabba and Tevunah, are built. However, in the order whereby one clothes another, Yesod of Atik ends in Yesod of Arich Anpin.</b>
<i>Following our discussion of the various aspects of Arich Anpin, we will now examine the Partzufim of Abba and Imma starting with their root.</i>
<b>According to the way the chain of development is arranged, Yesod of Atik ends in the chest (Tiferet) of Arich Anpin…</b> Each Sefirah has a particular number of sections or “joints” (פרקים, <i>perakim</i>), all with their own measure. In the case of Yesod, the sections are Yesod and Ateret HaYesod – the Corona.
<b>…and it is from there that its Kindnesses (חסדים, <i>chassadim</i>) and Strengths (גבורות, <i>gevurot</i>) go forth and are revealed.</b> For in all the Partzufim, Daat spreads from the head into the body of the Partzuf and is wholly included in its Yesod and shines outwards. For Daat is the essence of the governmental order and this is how it must spread – going out of the vessel and openly spreading. This will be discussed later in its appropriate place (see Opening 124).
<b>Afterwards it is from there that Abba and Imma, Israel Sabba and Tevunah, are built.</b> When Chochmah and Binah of Atzilut become Partzufim, they receive a radiation from these Kindnesses and Strengths – their place on the Tree of the Partzufim is facing the Kindnesses and Strengths of Atik, which are revealed when they emerge from the Yesod of Atik and spread in the chest of Arich Anpin. Against the chest are Abba and Imma, which clothe the arms of Arich Anpin down to the navel. It is through the power of the Kindnesses and Strengths of Atik that Abba and Imma divide into four Partzufim – the first and second Israel Sabba and Tevunah, as will be discussed in its appropriate place (see Opening 128). (The ending of Yesod of Atik in the chest of Arich Anpin is included in the category of the developmental chain because it causes the division of Chochmah and Binah into four Partzufim, which involves the <i>structure</i> of the Partzufim.)
<b>However, in the order whereby one clothes another, Yesod of Atik ends in Yesod of Arich Anpin.</b> What we have said about Yesod of Atik ending in Arich in terms of the developmental chain does not contradict our saying that, as Yesod of Atik is <i>clothed</i> in Arich Anpin it ends in Yesod of Arich, because the Partzufim clothe one another in a different order, as explained in the previous Opening.

Chapter 111

<i>Abba and Imma – spread of the Concealed Wisdom in the columns of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy via the Beard for Zeir Anpin</i>
<b>Abba and Imma are an extension of Chochmah S’tima’ah, the Concealed Wisdom, through the columns of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy included therein, after their having spread forth through the mystery of the Beard. Abba and Imma are rooted in the mystery of the Mazal of Notzer and the Mazal of Venakeh.</b>
<i>Having explained the root of Abba and Imma – Yesod of Atik as revealed in the chest of Arich Anpin – we will now discuss Abba and Imma themselves.</i>
<b>Abba and Imma are an extension of Chochmah S’tima’ah, the Concealed Wisdom, through the columns of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy included therein… </b>Chochmah S’tima’ah is the root from which Zeir Anpin – the governmental order of Justice based on Kindness-Judgment-Mercy – emerges. As such, Chochmah S’tima’ah includes all the Kindness-Judgment-Mercy contained in all the Three Heads of Arich Anpin – for as the Third Head, Chochmah S’tima’ah includes what is in all three.
This is the mystery of Yud-Vav-Dalet, HeA-Aleph, Vav-Aleph-Vav – the “expanded” form of the letters Yud-Heh-Vav of MaH contained in Chochmah S’tima’ah. The numerical value of these letters is 39 = (ט"ל, Tet-Lamed) = TaL, “dew” – the Dew of Bedolach (see Opening 89). Here lies the root of the entire governmental order of Justice down below. In terms of the Three Heads, Chochmah S’timaah is in the category of Judgment (in relation to the Skull – Kindness, and the Cavity – Mercy) and is governed from Gevurah of Atik. (Gevurah of Atik is concealed within the Brain, which accordingly has the reddish hue of the Bedolach stone.)
Accordingly, everything that came before is rooted in Chochmah S’tima’ah – for although it is in the category of Judgment, it also contains an aspect of Kindness since Chochmah is on the right. Chochmah S’tima’ah is the Nukva of Arich Anpin. For Keter, the Skull, is the right-inclined Head – the male aspect of Arich Anpin, while Chochmah S’tima’ah is the left-inclined Head – the female aspect. All this is because Chessed and Gevurah of Atik are clothed respectively in the Skull and in Chochmah S’tima’ah.
But the Kindness-Judgment-Mercy contained within Chochmah S’tima’ah must spread forth and descend through the chain of development. This they do through the Beard, as discussed earlier. The Beard is essentially a power drawing forth the hidden light of Chochmah S’tima’ah that fills the pipes or channels of which it consists. The very light that was concealed within it is revealed on the outside through Abba and Imma.
See how all this is literally the root of Zeir Anpin. For Abba and Imma, which derive from Chochmah S’tima’ah, do not merely give Zeir Anpin additional influence but actually build his Partzuf, since they give him the Mental Powers that are the essence of his government, just as in every Partzuf the government derives from its Mental Powers. Clearly this is because Zeir Anpin alone cannot do what is necessary since Zeir Anpin consists of only the Six Directions (Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet-Netzach-Hod-Yesod). They are only complete with Keter-Chochmah-Binah, which are rooted here in Chochmah S’tima’ah in the mystery of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, as I have explained. They subsequently descend level by level until they reach their place as the Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin, for their purpose is to complete Zeir Anpin, as will be discussed later.
<b>…after their having spread forth through the mystery of the Beard.</b> First they had to spread forth in the Beard in order to acquire the quality of expansiveness and produce all the necessary levels – the 13 Repairs of the Beard.
<b>Abba and Imma are rooted in the mystery of the Mazal of Notzer and the Mazal of Venakeh </b>– i.e. in the Beard itself when it spreads forth. The Beard is thus the root of these two levels that were to emerge through its power. The Mazal of Notzer and the Mazal of Venakeh essentially include the entire Beard. One of these two levels – Abba – is rooted in the Mazal of Notzer, the male aspect, and the other – Imma – in the Mazal of Venakeh, the female. Abba and Imma likewise come forth as male and female, and each has its own function – the male as befits it in accordance with its root, and likewise in the case of the female.

Chapter 112

<i>Abba reveals the Mental Powers as a whole, Imma in detail.</i>
<b>Abba is the mystery of the three Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin – but as one whole, like seed in the brain of the father. Imma is a revelation of the Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin: in Imma they are prepared in detail like an embryo in its mother’s belly.</b>
<i>Having discussed the function of Abba and Imma, let us now examine them in more detail.</i>
<b>Abba is the mystery of the three Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin – but as one whole…</b> As already discussed, Abba and Imma are an extension of Chochmah S’tima’ah bringing Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers (Keter-Chochmah-Binah) to the necessary level. However, there is a difference between Abba and Imma – just as there is a difference in the role of the father and mother in producing their joint offspring. Initially the offspring is in the male in potential as a single, undifferentiated whole, and this is how it leaves the male. However, the female differentiates the embryo into its particulars during the Pregnancy until signs of the growing embryo are clearly discernible from the outside.
So it is above: Abba and Imma both contain Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers within them, and their role is to bring them out to the open. However, when Abba does so, he brings them forth as a single, undifferentiated whole. In the case of Imma, however, they are discernible within her even during the Pregnancy and all the more so after she gives birth to them.
<b>…like seed in the brain of the father.</b> For the seed originates in the brain, where it is included as a single whole. And even when it comes forth, it does so as an undifferentiated whole.
<b>Imma is a revelation of the Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin: in Imma they are prepared in detail like an embryo in its mother’s belly.</b> Here we have the mystery of Chochmah and Binah: Chochmah is general, whereas Binah is the thinking process (התבוננות, <i>hitbonenut</i>, applied to the overall concept of Chochmah, analyzing matters in detail. Accordingly, Abba extends to provide a general revelation of the Mental Powers, and likewise Abba brings them forth as one overall whole. In Imma the Mental Powers differentiate into their details, and likewise when Imma performs her motherly function, she reveals their detailed components like an embryo in its mother’s belly.

Chapter 113

<i>The coupling of Abba and Imma – root of Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers – is constant; that of Israel Sabba and Tevunah – which transfer them to Zeir Anpin – is sporadic.</i>
<b>The interactive coupling of Abba and Imma above is continuous so as not to interrupt the proper functioning of the Mental Powers at root. However, through Israel Sabba and Tevunah the Mental Powers extend to produce Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin in the order that befits him.</b>
<i>Having discussed Abba and Imma in themselves, let us now examine their coupling.</i>
<b>The interactive coupling of Abba and Imma above is continuous so as not to interrupt the proper functioning of the Mental Powers at root. </b>As discussed earlier, the governmental order depends on the Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin. These Mental Powers are liable to “ascend” (to be enhanced) or “descend” (to be diminished) as required for the allocation of reward and punishment in the world according to men’s deeds. And the strength of the flow of influence into the world is in proportion to the strength of these Mental Powers.
However, it must be understood that for any given light to carry out its function, its source must be strong and enduring. The light may then spread forth or not depending on what is required – but it cannot cease to exist at a certain time thus requiring the creation of the same light anew at some other time. In these terms, Abba and Imma are the very source and root of the Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin, and this root must not be damaged. However, the role of Israel Sabba and Tevunah is to bring the Mental Powers into Zeir Anpin. Since the Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin are subject to ascents and descents, the coupling of Israel Sabba and Tevunah is not constant.
It could be objected that in the teachings of the ARI of blessed memory we seem to find the opposite – that the coupling which produces the Mental Powers is not continuous, while the coupling that channels vitality to the worlds is continuous (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar HaZivugim</i> ch. 1).
The answer is that here we are talking about qualities possessed by the Partzufim that enable them to function properly in the governmental order rather than about the actual functioning of the Partzufim. For the lights descend level by level in the chain of development as required by the governmental order. The Mental Powers contained in Zeir Anpin are the foundation of the overall governmental order of Justice based on Kindness-Judgment-Mercy. All the rest of the Partzuf of Zeir Anpin – Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet and Netzach-Hod-Yesod – follows accordingly, but the essential root is the Mental Powers. Understand that we are now talking not about the <i>functioning</i> but rather about the <i>nature</i> of the lights on various levels – i.e. about the <i>role</i> of each light in the governmental order, not how it actually executes that role or function.
When the overall light reaches the level to produce Chochmah-Binah-Daat in Zeir Anpin – this being the level of Abba and Imma – it can then be said to have reached the stage of setting the governmental order on its proper foundation. However, while the role of Abba and Imma is to produce this Chochmah-Binah-Daat in Zeir Anpin, Abba and Imma are still only the root, because the light is not yet on the level required for the actual government of the world. The actual transfer of Chochmah-Binah-Daat to Zeir Anpin is accomplished by Israel Sabba and Tevunah.
In accordance with the principle that each function has a root, Abba and Imma – which are the root of Chochmah-Binah-Daat in Zeir Anpin – have their own root above. This is Chochmah S’tima’ah, which contains the root of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, and this is what produces Abba and Imma – the general and the particular. Abba’s entire function is bound up with Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, but as one whole, whereas Imma differentiates Kindness-Judgment-Mercy into their particulars – yet Imma is still called a root. This root subsequently extends further in order to determine the governmental order of Justice in Zeir Anpin on its proper foundation by producing Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers in him. This institutes the governmental order in its proper place with a degree of power suited to the worlds.
Accordingly we said that the coupling of the supreme Abba and Imma – which are Kindness-Judgment-Mercy only at root – is continuous, because Abba and Imma are in a continuous state of repair, being a revelation of the underlying unity of MaH and BaN (the perfection that must be attained in the end). Likewise all the benefits produced by their coupling are continuous.
However the function of Israel Sabba and Tevunah is to extend downwards for the sake of Zeir Anpin, and they are thus closer to the level of Zeir Anpin (which is subject to ascents and descents, immaturity and maturity etc.) The state of repair in Israel Sabba and Tevunah is accordingly not continuous. On the contrary, when there is no need for any new action – i.e. to generate new Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin – Israel Sabba and Tevunah merely transfer influence already prepared and rectified at root through the coupling of Abba and Imma to channel vitality to the worlds. In this case, the Mental Powers transferred by Israel Sabba and Tevunah derive from the previous coupling.
However, when new Mental Powers are required in Zeir Anpin, Israel Sabba and Tevunah must also be included in the process of coupling that produces them since they have to take the new aspect produced through the coupling and bring it down into Zeir Anpin. (In this case Israel Sabba and Tevunah do not simply transfer influence from Abba and Imma but extend and join with them as they couple, thereby forming one Partzuf.) But when Israel Sabba and Tevunah function in Zeir Anpin through being clothed therein, there is certainly no need for them to couple – involving new arousal and excitement – because they then serve only to channel influence from Abba and Imma. The latter, however, are the very root of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, and accordingly their interactive coupling must be in a constant state of repair.
To summarize: we must distinguish between the intrinsic nature of these Partzufim on the one hand and their actual functioning on the other. Their intrinsic nature as the root of the Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin remains constant, but their functioning – to spread and actually transfer the Mental Powers to Zeir Anpin – is not constant but depends on men’s deeds. Nevertheless, they function in accordance with their intrinsic nature. The coupling that channels vitality to the worlds derives from the root of the governmental order (Abba and Imma), which is always in a state of repair. However the purpose of the coupling that produces new Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin – i.e. when Chochmah and Binah, Israel Sabba and Tevunah join together – is that these powers should spread to the lower realms. And since it depends on men’s deeds, it is therefore not constant.
<b>However, through Israel Sabba and Tevunah the Mental Powers extend to produce Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin in the order that befits him.</b> Their purpose is to bring the government from the root to its proper place.

Chapter 114

<i>The path of influence from Arich Anpin to Zeir and Nukva</i>
<b>The order in which influence descends is from the two Mazalot of Notzer and Venakeh by way of the Palate and Throat to Abba and Imma, and from Abba and Imma together to Zeir Anpin, and from Zeir Anpin to the Nukva. The influence takes on a different form according to the way it spreads.</b>
<i>Following our discussion of the coupling of Abba and Imma, we must explain the order of the descent of influences from their root to the very end.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The order in which… Part 2: The influence…</b>
<b>Part 1: The order in which influence descends…</b> There is truly no purpose in discussing what takes place in the Hidden Brain since it is intrinsically beyond our comprehension. The influence streams down traveling on paths that start there. As discussed earlier, Arich Anpin is the root while all the other Partzufim are branches of it. The Beard is an extension the purpose of which is to draw influence from the root down to the very last level in the world – for although the Beard itself does not reach there, its influence does.
<b>…is from the two Mazalot of Notzer and Venakeh…</b> These two comprise the entire governmental order, and accordingly, the totality of the spreading influence.
<b>…by way of the Palate and Throat…</b> The flow is not channeled directly from the Mazal of Venakeh to Abba and Imma but enters into the Throat. The reason is that the Throat of Arich Anpin is Keter of Abba and Imma. (“Binah of Arich, which is in the Throat, becomes two crowns for Abba and Imma” – <i>Etz Chayim</i>,<i> Shaar Arich Anpin</i> ch. 2.) The flow must enter there in order to go into their interior. For this reason, when the light reaches the Mazal of Venakeh (the overall receiver of the 13 Repairs of the Beard), it returns, enters the Throat and from there goes to Abba and Imma. In entering the Throat it must pass by way of the Palate, which is the male aspect, i.e. Chochmah (of Binah), in relation to the Throat, which is Binah (of Binah).
Thus after the light spreads forth from the Two Mazalot, it returns from the Mazal of Venakeh and enters the Palate. From the Palate it goes to the Throat and from there to Abba and Imma. This is why the Proposition says “<i>by way of</i> the Palate and Throat” – because this is the path that was laid down and not as may appear to the eye. (The light does not travel directly from the Beard – which extends as far as the Navel of Arich Anpin – to the Head of Zeir Anpin, which is from the Navel of Arich and below. Instead the light turns back from the Beard, traveling inside via the Palate and Throat in order to reach the Heads of Abba and Imma first.)
<b>…to Abba and Imma…</b> i.e. together – for the nature of Abba and Imma is to be equal in the sense that the receiver is still on the same level as the giver of influence and not on a lower level as is the case down below, where the Nukva is beneath Zeir Anpin. Abba and Imma are able to stand on the same level because here the receiver is in a state of repair. This is because any damage caused by the lower creations does not reach as far as Imma, making it possible for the receiver to stand on the same level as the giver of influence.
<b>…and from Abba and Imma together to Zeir Anpin…</b> This is clearly the proper order – for Zeir Anpin is Daat, the intermediary reconciliatory factor between Chochmah and Binah: Daat receives the lights of both together.
<b>…and from Zeir Anpin to the Nukva.</b> In this case the receiver is not on the same level as the giver of influence but below – the Nukva stands from the navel of Zeir Anpin and below – because the deeds of the lower creations are liable to impair the receiver.
<b>Part 2: The influence takes on a different form according to the way it spreads.</b> The purpose of all these many levels is to bring the influence to a level suitable for its receivers. The lower any given level, the nearer it is to the lowest creations. When the influence reaches a lower level, it is affected by that lower level and assumes its nature. This is how the influence comes ever closer to the creatures of the lowest world, until it reaches the last level, where it is right by them.

Chapter 115

<big><strong>Zeir and Nukva: General Principles (Openings 115-118)</strong></big>
<i>Zeir Anpin and Nukva – root of the lower creations</i>
<b>The root of all the creations in the world lies in Zeir Anpin and Nukva, and it is in essence through them that the world is governed. The arrangements instituted in them are thus on a level suitable for the government of the world. Accordingly all their different aspects are known in greater detail inasmuch as they are nearer to us.</b>
<i>Having completed our examination of Abba and Imma, we will now discuss the Partzufim that follow them in the chain of development – Zeir Anpin and Nukva.</i>
This proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: The root…</b> Zeir Anpin and Nukva are the root of this world. <b>Part 2: Accordingly…</b> This is the reason why they are discussed in greater detail in terms of the human form.
<b>Part 1: The root of all the creations in the world lies in Zeir Anpin and Nukva…</b> As explained earlier in connection with the World of Nekudim, the seven lower Sefirot are the root of all the individual creations, while everything above them is only a necessary preparation in order to reach this level (see Opening 51).
<b>…and it is in essence through them that the world is governed.</b> Since Zeir Anpin and Nukva are the chief root of the creations, they also make up the main levels of the governmental order to which those creations are subject.
<b>The arrangements instituted in them are thus on a level suitable for the government of the world.</b> For as discussed earlier, the arrangements and repairs (Heb. <i>tikkunim</i>) in each Partzuf match its particular nature in order to ensure the complete repair of the Partzuf in question and its orderly functioning. (Thus Arich Anpin has unique arrangements in the Head and Beard, Zeir Anpin and Nukva have the aspects of immaturity and maturity, and so on.) It is Zeir Anpin and Nukva that essentially govern this world, and accordingly the particular repairs instituted in them must be precisely what relates to the government of this world since this is their function.
<b>Part 2: Accordingly all their different aspects are known in greater detail…</b> The Kabbalistic writings enter into fewer details about the construction of Abba and Imma than in the case of Zeir Anpin and Nukva, where there is extensive discussion of their stages of immaturity and maturity, how many years these stages last and the details involved in the different states of the Partzufim – face-to-face, back-to-back and so on. The reason for this is because the higher Partzufim are only the indirect cause of our world while Zeir and Nukva are the immediate cause. Accordingly they contain aspects parallel to all that exists in man below in all their individual details. For if this were not the case, these aspects would not exist here below.
<b>…inasmuch as they are nearer to us.</b> The earlier Partzufim do not directly generate these aspects in the world below and there is therefore no need to trace their roots in those Partzufim. It is only from the inception of Zeir Anpin and Nukva that these resulting offspring come into being, and their roots must therefore be contained within Zeir and Nukva.

Chapter 116

<i>Abba and Imma direct Zeir Anpin through his Mental Powers; the Keter derives from Arich Anpin.</i>
<b>Through the Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin, Abba and Imma are grafted into and rule Zeir Anpin. The Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin are founded on Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, for these make up the entire cycle of government. According to the strength of the Mental Powers, so is the strength of the entire body. Keter of Zeir Anpin is the mystery of Arich Anpin.</b>
<i>Having introduced the subject of Zeir Anpin and Nukva in general we must now examine them in detail, beginning with Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers – Chochmah-Binah-Daat – and everything related to this.</i><br> <i>“…Netzach-Hod-Yesod of Imma change from their original nature to become ‘bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh’ of Zeir Anpin himself and are literally like his own body” – </i>Etz Chayim<i>, </i>Shaar HaMochin deTzelem<i> ch. 1. “And Tiferet of Arich Anpin turns into the Keter and Skull of Zeir Anpin” – ibid. </i>Shaar Arich Anpin<i> ch. 7.</i>
The proposition has two parts: <b>Part 1: Through the Mental Powers…</b> This explains what Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers are. <b>Part 2: According to the strength…</b> The body is governed entirely by the Mental Powers.
<b>Part 1: Through the Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin …</b> The main essence of Zeir Anpin consists of the Six Directions – Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod and Yesod. This is because the function of Zeir Anpin is to serve as the root of the creations of this world, to sustain and govern them, and all this is only through the Six Directions. However, the Mental Powers exist in Zeir Anpin by virtue of the way Abba and Imma are grafted into him, as the proposition goes on to state.
<b>…Abba and Imma are grafted into…</b> The Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin are Chochmah-Binah-Daat, the light of the interior soul (פנימיות <i>pnimiyut</i>) contained within, as discussed in its appropriate place. The particular nature of Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers derives from the way Abba and Imma are grafted into him in order to complete and perfect the governmental order in the proper way on the basis of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy (see Opening 113).
<b>…and rule Zeir Anpin.</b> It is through the rule of Abba and Imma over Zeir Anpin that these Sefirot of Chochmah-Binah-Daat are found in Zeir Anpin as a result of this engrafting. Their presence in Zeir Anpin testifies to the rule of Abba and Imma over him.
<b>The Mental Powers of Zeir Anpin are founded on Kindness-Judgment-Mercy…</b> Since Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet and Netzach-Hod-Yesod are arranged in the columns of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, the factors governing them – the Mental Powers – are also arranged in the same way.
<b>…for these make up the entire cycle of government.</b> The reason Zeir Anpin and his governmental order are founded on the basis of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy is that this is what is required for the entire cycle of six thousand years, the period of service.
<b>Part 2: According to the strength of the Mental Powers…</b> Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers vary in strength in the phases of immaturity and maturity and so too in the ascents that follow maturity. This is because the degree to which Abba and Imma are grafted into and rule Zeir Anpin may be lesser or greater.
<b>…so is the strength of the entire body.</b> All of Zeir Anpin’s power derives from Abba and Imma, and therefore the strength of Zeir Anpin depends on the strength with which Abba and Imma function within him.
<b>Keter of Zeir Anpin is the mystery of Arich Anpin.</b> Just as Abba and Imma govern Zeir Anpin through his Mental Powers, so too Arich Anpin enters through the Keter of Zeir Anpin in order to direct Zeir Anpin to the ultimate goal of the revelation of the unity.

Chapter 117

<i>The entry of Abba and Imma into Zeir Anpin generates additional Partzufim: Jacob and Leah and the diagonals.</i>
<b>Through the power of the engrafting of the Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin, various kinds of radiations emerge from Zeir Anpin himself. Likewise, the hind parts of Abba and Imma themselves – which descended to the place of Zeir Anpin and Nukva – become rectified as Partzufim and supplement Zeir Anpin and the Nukva. Sometimes both are needed as supplements, sometimes only one.</b>
<i>Following our discussion of the Mental Powers, we will now examine what arises out of them.</i>
<b>Through the power of the engrafting of the Mental Powers in Zeir Anpin…</b> There are lights that come forth in their own right rather than as the result of a specific engrafting: these are the Ten Sefirot of any given world with all their respective repairs and arrangements (such as the Ten Sefirot of the world of Atzilut, which divide up into the five principal Partzufim: Arich Anpin, Abba, Imma, Zeir Anpin=Israel and Nukva=Rachel). However, there are also additional Partzufim which are lights generated as a result of the engrafting of Abba and Imma in Zeir Anpin.
<b>…various kinds of radiations emerge from Zeir Anpin himself.</b> These are the staffs (מטות, <i>matot</i>) mentioned in their place and the other diagonals. (These are the staffs of Jacob and Leah, and Leah of the Generation of the Wilderness, the Clouds of Glory, the Manna, the Staff of God, the Staff of Moses, the Mixed Multitude and Esau – see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar He’arat HaMochin</i> ch’s 1-2; <i>Klalut HaIlan</i> 7:4).
These are nothing but a radiation of the Mental Powers as they settle in Zeir Anpin. The truth is that they radiate on all sides, but where there is a receiver they become absorbed within that receiver. Accordingly, the direct lights go to Rachel, Leah and Jacob. (Rachel is the essential Nukva, while Jacob and Leah are made from the hind parts of Abba and Imma, and when Abba and Imma become engrafted in Zeir Anpin through his Mental Powers, Jacob and Leah are there to receive radiations.) However, where there is no receiver, they radiate alone – creating these other Partzufim – the staffs and diagonals.
The governmental order is indeed drawn down directly to the receivers through the main Partzufim that are involved in this – Zeir and Nukva, Jacob and Leah – while these other radiations – the diagonals – are subordinate to them. Nevertheless, these other radiations also give rise to certain consequences in the government, but they come from the sides or at a tangent, as it were, rather than directly. There is some particular reason why these aspects emerge to carry out a unique function in the overall government.
<b>Likewise, the hind parts of Abba and Imma themselves – which descended to the place of Zeir Anpin and Nukva – become rectified as Partzufim…</b> The hind parts of Abba and Imma went down when the vessels broke. In the repair, through the light of Yesod of Imma in Zeir Anpin, the hind parts of Imma become Leah, while the light of Yesod of Abba generates Jacob.
<b>…and supplement Zeir Anpin and Nukva.</b> i.e. in coupling or interaction (זיווג, <i>zivug</i>). The main interaction is between Zeir Anpin and Rachel, but there is Zeir Anpin and Leah, Jacob and Leah and Jacob and Rachel.
<b>Sometimes both are needed as supplements…</b> As in the case of the interaction of Jacob and Leah.
<b>…sometimes only one.</b> As in the case of Israel (=Zeir Anpin) and Leah or of Jacob and Rachel. (The main Partzufim through which Zeir and Nukva are manifested are Israel and Rachel, but sometimes two others come in their place – Jacob and Leah. Sometimes both come, sometimes only one, such as Israel and Leah or Jacob and Rachel.)
The underlying foundation of all this is that the light of Zeir Anpin or the Nukva also shines through Jacob or Leah, in which case the latter supplement Zeir and Nukva and become aspects of them. (Earlier it was explained how the Partzufim of Jacob and Leah were instituted – through the repair of the fallen hind parts of Abba and Imma. Now we see that the interaction of Jacob and Leah may take the place of that of Zeir and Nukva while the latter radiate through them.)

Chapter 118

<i>Leah – the hind parts of Imma and inner soul of Nukva</i>
<b>In the hind parts of Imma, which make up the Partzuf of Leah, lies also the inner soul – <i>pnimiyut</i> – of the Nukva.</b>
<i>Introduction to the subject of Leah.</i>
<b>In the hind parts of Imma, which make up the Partzuf of Leah, lies also the inner soul – <i>pnimiyut</i> – of the Nukva.</b> The Nukva divides into interior and exterior, and both are governed from Zeir Anpin, who is their active giver of influence (משפיע, <i>mashpi’a</i>). These two levels of interior and exterior are considered as two Partzufim because each has its own purpose. The governmental order of the Nukva is double (כפול, <i>kaphul</i>) – the “Cave of MaKhPeLah”. On the inside (פנימיות, <i>pnimiyut</i>) of things lies one great governmental order founded on Truth, while the external governmental order is a different order of government – and this is what is visible to the eye.
Even though all the other lights also have the aspects of interiority and externality, the essence of this phenomenon is found here. For there are two kinds of government in the lower realms deriving respectively from Arich Anpin and Zeir Anpin. Accordingly there are two Nukvas who receive their influence as one. The main thing is to separate the interiority from the externality on this level – the Sefirah of Malchut – where they become two Partzufim. This is because this is the Sefirah through which things are done, and the various works are very different from one another.
When the light of Yesod of Imma goes out to repair the hind parts of Imma in order to make them into a Partzuf, also included there is the interiority of the Nukva, which is in concert with Imma – like a mother and daughter. Thus Leah contains two aspects: the back parts of Imma, which take the name of Nukva, and also the actual interiority of the Nukva.
This is why it sometimes appears as if Leah is secondary, because Leah is intrinsically only the hind parts of Imma built up into a separate Partzuf. On the other hand Leah is of primary importance inasmuch as she also contains the inner soul of the Nukva.
Thus the two aspects of Leah are as Nukva, through consisting of the hind parts of Imma, and as being the inner soul of Rachel. This distinction makes it possible to reconcile the teachings that give greater importance to Leah with those that give greater importance to Rachel.

Chapter 119

<big><strong>Building of Zeir Anpin in Pregnancy, Suckling and Maturity (Openings 119-123)</strong></big>
<i>Start of the repair of the breakage: Zeir Anpin and Nukva grow to maturity together.</i>
<b>Zeir Anpin and Nukva grow to maturity together, for the male aspect is never complete without his female. The immediate gain after the repair of the breakage was that Zeir and Nukva always go together.</b>
<i>Having discussed the overall function of Zeir and Nukva we must now explain the process of their construction.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: Zeir Anpin and Nukva…</b> Maturity comes to Zeir and Nukva together. <b>Part 2: The immediate gain…</b> This phenomenon is born out of the repair of the breaking of the vessels.
<b>Part 1: Zeir Anpin and Nukva grow to maturity together…</b> Zeir Anpin and Nukva are two separate Partzufim each with their own unique arrangements in accordance with their respective roles. (The unique repairs of Zeir Anpin are successively higher levels of Mental Powers, while those of the Nukva – separation, נסירה, <i>nesirah</i> , lit. “sawing” and the various states of face-to-face, back-to-back etc. – prepare her for coupling.) Nevertheless, one common aspect is that throughout the entire time of the building of Zeir Anpin, Nukva is with him.
Thus during the Pregnancy, Zeir Anpin is three Sefirot – Netzach-Hod-Yesod – with Nukva as the fourth over the Yesod. During Suckling, Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet are revealed – with Nukva attached to the back parts of Tiferet. In maturity, when Chochmah-Binah-Daat of Zeir Anpin are revealed, Malchut ascends and becomes rooted in Daat. It is true that afterwards Nukva must undergo further building in her own right from Zeir Anpin’s Netzach-Hod-Yesod, this being the main building of the Nukva. But the attachment of Nukva to Zeir Anpin in all his ascents is for the completion and perfection of Zeir Anpin – that is to say that the two of them will always be together.
<b>…for the male aspect is never complete without his female.</b> Nukva is found with Zeir Anpin in this way only in order to complete his functions, for Zeir Anpin is the head and Nukva is the end. Thus every repair received by Zeir Anpin is complete only through Nukva – because all the influences of Zeir Anpin are directed to the lower creations and channeled through Nukva.
<b>Part 2: The immediate gain after the repair of the breakage…</b> Even during the time of Zeir Anpin’s immaturity, his strength is greater than during the time of the breakage. For now, in the repair, an immediate connection was formed between Zeir Anpin and Nukva. This is the essence of what was missing during the time of the breakage. It was because of the lack of connection that the other repairs were absent, which is what led to the breakage. Once this was rectified, a place was prepared for all the other repairs to come about little by little.
<b>…was that Zeir and Nukva always go together.</b> The first work carried out – already in the Pregnancy of Zeir and Nukva – was to bring them together so that they would always continue going together.

Chapter 120

<i>Repair of the breakage in stages during Pregnancy, Suckling and Maturity</i>
<b>The Pregnancy is the process of purification in which the Sefirot of Zeir Anpin are sorted out from literal desolation so as to stand in proper order. Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers in this period are at their lowest possible degree of strength. This is called Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the Mental Powers and is termed Nefesh. During Suckling there is growth in all the lights as they expand to their fullest dominion, and his Mental Powers are stronger than at first. This is called Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet of the Mental Powers and is termed Ruach. In Maturity the Mental Powers extend in all their different aspects to govern Zeir Anpin and Nukva through the power of Chochmah-Binah-Daat. They are then at full power, and this is termed Neshamah.</b>
<i>Having discussed the first repair received by Zeir Anpin after the breaking of the vessels, we will now examine the process of gradual repair that followed.</i>
<b>The Pregnancy is the process of purification in which the Sefirot of Zeir Anpin are sorted out from literal desolation…</b> First there was the destruction – the breaking of the vessels – but now the different levels are sorted out and the laws of orderly government are laid down. Whereas initially the Sefirot were not arranged in columns  but were merely levels one beneath the other – which is why the destruction took place – the repair required that they now be given this arrangement of columns <b>… so as to stand in proper order.</b> Accordingly everything that has to be in the rectified Partzuf must be produced during the period of Pregnancy so as to be arranged in columns – Netzach-Hod-Yesod – as mentioned earlier.
<b>Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers…</b> i.e. his inner soul – Heb. <i>pnimiyut</i> – because it is impossible to have neither interiority nor externality. Thus even during Pregnancy there are Mental Powers.
<b>…in this period are at their lowest possible degree of strength.</b> As discussed earlier, the strength of the body is according to the strength of the Mental Powers. Accordingly, when the Mental Powers are at minimum strength, the body also remains concealed and powerless. (Thus in Pregnancy, only Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the body are revealed, while the head – Chochmah-Binah-Daat – and chest – Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet—are folded up behind them “three within three”.)
<b>This is called Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the Mental Powers…</b> This is because everything is measured in terms of the Ten Sefirot, and thus the Mental Powers of Chochmah-Binah-Daat as a whole are likewise measured in these terms. Accordingly the stages in which the Mental Powers develop follow the steps on the ladder of the Ten Sefirot: Netzach-Hod-Yesod, Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet, Chochmah-Binah-Daat. Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the Mental Powers – their lowest possible degree of strength – is one single level of the Mental Powers as a whole.
<b>…and is termed Nefesh.</b> For the successive levels of the inner soul, the pnimiyut, are called Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah.
<b>During Suckling there is growth…</b> During the stage of Suckling (יניקה, <i>yenikah</i>) there are no additional new lights. Rather, the Sefirot already built in the Pregnancy now grow and expand, and thus Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet, which were there already, albeit concealed, now become revealed.
<b>…in all the lights…</b> The growth is not on any one particular side but in <i>all</i> the previously built Sefirot, which now expand in length and breadth. This is based on the mystery of the human form: during pregnancy the body is built in all its various parts, but in the period of Suckling it is the parts already built that expand.
<b>…as they expand to their fullest dominion…</b> When we speak of expansion, we mean that the governmental power included in the intrinsic law of each light becomes complete – all the different parts of the governmental order intensify the power with which they operate. Initially they were closed up in themselves, concealing their full power and dominion, but afterwards they expand and reveal this dominion.
<b>…and his Mental Powers are stronger than at first.</b> This is because, as we said above, the strength of the body corresponds to the Mental Powers.
<b>This is called Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet of the Mental Powers and is termed Ruach.</b> This should be clear in the light of what was explained above about the stages of development of the Mental Powers.
<b>In Maturity the Mental Powers extend in all their different aspects…</b> The whole of Pregnancy and Suckling is a period of preparation and repair to the body in its various parts, which are built in Pregnancy and expand during Suckling. But Maturity (גדלות, <i>gadlut</i>, “greatness”) depends on the extension of the Mental Powers in all the possible aspects of their pathways and details so that the government can go forth properly accordingly.
<b>…to govern Zeir Anpin and Nukva through the power of Chochmah-Binah-Daat.</b> For the specific intention here in Maturity is to bring Abba and Imma to complete rule over Zeir Anpin by providing him with his Chochmah-Binah-Daat.
<b>They are then at full power…</b> i.e. there is no further period of growth after Maturity: the periods of growth are completed at twenty years of age.
<b>…and this is termed Neshamah.</b> This is the end of the scale of the inner soul, the pnimiyut, as stated above.

Chapter 121

<i>Completion of Zeir Anpin during Pregnancy, Suckling and Maturity</i>
<b>From the outset Zeir Anpin was built as Ten Sefirot through the binding together of the Mental Powers over the Six Directions – for they did not radiate in this way in the World of Desolation. Zeir Anpin is then described as being in fixed possession of Netzach-Hod-Yesod, while the others still need to be revealed in actuality. The entire period of Pregnancy is a process of gradual preparation to enable Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet to be revealed. Immediately on coming forth from Imma, Zeir Anpin is in fixed possession of Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet, and we say that Chochmah-Binah-Daat are in the process of coming.</b>
<b>To repair Netzach-Hod-Yesod so that Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet can be revealed over them requires the entire period of Pregnancy. And to repair Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet so that Chochmah-Binah-Daat may be revealed over them requires the entire period of Suckling, for they are thus steadily drawn down in stages in the necessary way. Yet even so, the initial purification is not truly complete until the first twenty-four months of Suckling, because only then is the purification of Hod-Yesod-Malchut complete.</b>
<i>We will now embark on a fuller discussion of the three periods of Pregnancy, Suckling and Mental Maturity.</i>
The proposition divides into three parts. <b>Part 1: From the outset…</b> This presents the concepts of Pregnancy, Suckling and Mental Maturity. <b>Part 2: To repair…</b> This explains the duration of the periods of Pregnancy and Suckling. <b>Part 3: Yet even so the initial purification…</b> Significance of the twenty-four months of Suckling.
<b>Part 1: From the outset Zeir Anpin was built as Ten Sefirot… </b>Two apparently contradictory teachings are found in the writings of the ARI of blessed memory. In one place it states that during Pregnancy Netzach-Hod-Yesod are repaired, while Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet are repaired during Suckling (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Pirkey HaTzelem</i> chs 1-3). Elsewhere, however, it states that during the Pregnancy it is Chochmah-Binah-Daat, Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet and Netzach that are repaired – leaving Hod-Yesod-Malchut still to be cleansed (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar RaPaCh</i> chs 5-6).
To resolve this apparent contradiction, it must be understood that two things had to happen with respect to Zeir Anpin. The first is that Zeir Anpin had to be <i>built</i> on all his levels – i.e. as a structure of Ten Sefirot – through the process of sorting and purification (בירור, <i>birur</i>) from the World of Desolation, as explained in the preceding Opening. (The second thing that had to happen – the successive <i>revelation</i> of these already-built levels in the course of Pregnancy, Suckling and Maturity – will be addressed presently.)
Thus having initially in the World of Desolation consisted of only the Six Directions, Zeir Anpin was now from the very outset of the repair – the beginning of the Pregnancy – built as Ten Sefirot <b>…through the binding together of the Mental Powers over the Six Directions – for they did not radiate in this way in the World of Desolation.</b> It is now that Zeir Anpin becomes complete with the full complement of Ten Sefirot, because the Mental Powers are bound up with the body, which was not the case at first.
Nevertheless, what is <i>revealed</i> of his Sefirot during the Pregnancy is not what has been <i>repaired</i>. All the Ten Sefirot are repaired from the effects of the desolation, although Hod, Yesod and Malchut still remain to be repaired completely. However, what is revealed in Zeir Anpin during the Pregnancy is only Netzach-Hod-Yesod.
This is clearly the case, because it must be that <i>all</i> the Sefirot are sorted and purified during the Pregnancy. We cannot resolve the contradiction by saying that although Hod-Yesod-Malchut of the overall Netzach-Hod-Yesod still remain to be purified, it is the rest of the Sefirot of the overall Netzach-Hod-Yesod that were purified during the nine months of Pregnancy. For if so, when does the purification of the other Sefirot – i.e. the overall Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet and Chochmah-Binah-Daat of Zeir Anpin – take place? And indeed we see with our own eyes here in the world below that the entire building of the human body is completed during pregnancy.
Rather, as we have said, the sifting and selection of all the Ten Sefirot of Zeir Anpin takes place during the Pregnancy, but what is <i>revealed</i> in that period is a different matter. For Netzach-Hod-Yesod are revealed during the Pregnancy, while the rest still remain to be revealed.<br> (Summary: The sorting and purification of all the Ten Sefirot is carried out during the Pregnancy, even though the repair of Hod-Yesod-Malchut is deficient. Nevertheless, only Netzach-Hod-Yesod are revealed during Pregnancy – for the embryo is “like a folded tablet, with only his legs visible” – <i>Niddah</i> 30b, “three within three”.)
<b>Zeir Anpin is then described as being in fixed possession of Netzach-Hod-Yesod, while the others still need to be revealed in actuality.</b> This should be clear in the light of what I have written.
<b>The entire period of Pregnancy is a process of gradual preparation little by little to enable Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet to be revealed.</b> Zeir Anpin possesses Netzach-Hod-Yesod immediately but this is not to say that they are complete, for to be complete they must have Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet revealed over them. The entire period of the Pregnancy is a process of preparation towards this. The reason is because it is impossible for there to be any less than Netzach-Hod-Yesod, and we must therefore say that Netzach-Hod-Yesod are present from the start of the Pregnancy, even though they are not complete until its end. During the Pregnancy, Netzach-Hod-Yesod are steadily prepared to receive Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet at the time of birth.
This enables us to resolve an apparent problem in the teachings of the ARI of blessed memory. For the full period of Suckling (יניקה, <i>yenikah</i>) is defined as continuing until the age of thirteen years – only then is Zeir Anpin called mature (גדול, <i>gadol</i>). But that is the time when Chochmah-Binah-Daat complete their entry, not when they start to come. If so it would seem that Zeir Anpin should be called mature immediately after the first twenty-four months of Suckling, for that is when Chochmah-Binah-Daat start to enter.
However we cannot say that this is the correct order – that “Pregnancy” applies to the entire period from the beginning of Netzach-Hod-Yesod until their completion while “Suckling” lasts only from the start of Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet until their completion (i.e. from birth until the conclusion of the first twenty-four months of Suckling), with “Maturity” being from the start of Chochmah-Binah-Daat – at twenty-four months – until their completion at thirteen years.
We cannot define Suckling and Maturity in this way for three reasons: (1) If Maturity is defined as beginning at the conclusion of twenty-four months of Suckling, which is when Chochmah-Binah-Daat start to enter, there would have to be a fourth period after thirteen years, when Chochmah-Binah-Daat are complete. The period of Suckling would then be defined as lasting only for the first twenty-four months and Maturity until thirteen years, while the ensuing period would have to be called by a different name.
(2) This is not what we find in the teachings of the ARI of blessed memory. Rather the term Suckling applies until thirteen years and one day.
(3) If we were to define Suckling and Maturity as above, we would have to say that Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet begin to enter from birth and only complete their entry at twenty-four months, just as Chochmah-Binah-Daat start to enter at twenty-four months and complete their entry at thirteen years. However, here in the world below we see with our own eyes that this is not so. For the embryo is released from the bonds in which he was bent up in his mother’s belly “three within three” immediately on emergence from the womb. The baby spreads his arms and legs at once, and thus we see that Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet are already complete at birth without needing the first twenty-four months of Suckling.
Rather we must say that Netzach-Hod-Yesod come at the beginning of the Pregnancy, as soon as the embryo has taken its form forty days after conception. Just as we see that a person’s mental powers of Chochmah-Binah-Daat develop gradually in childhood until he attains full Daat at the age of thirteen (thus becoming liable for his actions), similarly, throughout the period of Pregnancy Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet enter gradually and then, at the very moment of birth, they become revealed completely.
What was built during the Pregnancy is completed during the first twenty-four months of Suckling, this being the period of the purification of Hod-Yesod-Malchut. (As discussed below, although a child has legs at birth, he is unable to walk until later.) From the conclusion of these twenty-four months until thirteen years, Chochmah-Binah-Daat begin to enter, but the entire period from birth until thirteen years – Suckling (יניקה, <i>yenikah</i>) and childhood (קטנות, <i>katnut</i>) – is called that of Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet. For these are revealed at birth and during this period become increasingly ready to receive Chochmah-Binah-Daat over them. Then at Maturity, Chochmah-Binah-Daat enter completely, and accordingly the period after thirteen years is called Maturity (גדלות, <i>gadlut</i>.) Thus the proposition goes on to state:
<b>Immediately on coming forth from Imma, Zeir Anpin is in fixed possession of Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet, and we say that Chochmah-Binah-Daat are in the process of coming.</b><br> (To summarize: The different periods are not named after what is under repair but rather after what has already been repaired. At the beginning of the Pregnancy Netzach-Hod-Yesod are complete, and accordingly the entire Pregnancy is called Netzach-Hod-Yesod. At the moment of birth, Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet are complete, and accordingly the entire period of Suckling until thirteen years is called Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet. At thirteen years the repair of Chochmah-Binah-Daat is complete, and the ensuing period is therefore called Maturity, גדלות, <i>gadlut</i> and Chochmah-Binah-Daat.)
<b>Part 2: To repair Netzach-Hod-Yesod so that Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet can be revealed over them requires the entire period of Pregnancy.</b> Just as the thirteen years and one day are explained as the time needed for Chochmah-Binah-Daat to enter over Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet, similarly the nine months of Pregnancy are the time of preparation for Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet to enter over Netzach-Hod-Yesod. The two periods do not need to be of equal lengths, because in each case the time involved depends on the needs of the process.
<b>And to repair Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet so that Chochmah-Binah-Daat may be revealed over them requires the entire period of Suckling…</b> This is clear from the teachings of the ARI of blessed memory about the mystery of the thirteen years and one day. (The term Suckling here refers to the entire period of thirteen years until Maturity.)
<b>…for they are thus steadily drawn down in stages in the necessary way.</b> It is the gradual, stage-by-stage developmental process that determines the time period. The stages in any given case depend on factors intrinsic to that case and the time involved is measured according to that specific gradation. As a general rule, wherever we find a time period specified for some given process, we know that this is the gradation required because of the intrinsic nature of the aspect involved.
<b>Part 3: Yet even so, the initial purification is not truly complete…</b> This refers to the actual sorting out and purification of the Sefirot of Zeir Anpin from the World of Desolation. However there is a difference between the process of purification in the Pregnancy and that during Suckling. Initially, in the World of Desolation, destruction held sway and did not allow the levels – the Sefirot – to endure. All the levels of Zeir Anpin emerged from this during the time of the Pregnancy, when he was built as Ten Sefirot, except that Hod-Yesod-Malchut did not emerge completely from ruin. Not that they remained in a literal state of ruin, but they did not complete their exit. For this reason they exist but they cannot carry out their function properly.
Likewise we see that a child has legs but he cannot walk. What is meant by saying that Hod-Yesod-Malchut were not entirely purified during Pregnancy is that these Sefirot were the most ready to become flawed and severely darkened through men’s deeds, as explained in various places in connection with the verse “faint all the day” (Lamentations 1:13), where the letters of the Hebrew word for “faint”, דוה, <i>DaVaH</i>, spell out the word HOD backwards.
Thus we see that this world has also already emerged from desolation in the sense that it has been created and is no longer “desolation and void”. It is just that its “legs” have not been repaired and therefore it has no support and totters time after time. And the sages said, “Because of the nettle the cabbage is hit” (<i>Bava Kama</i> 92a) – which alludes to the way Netzach too becomes darkened because of the flaw in Hod. Thus the various flaws that exist now in the world all cause a flaw in Hod and darken Netzach. The legs exist – the Torah and commandments exist – but they cannot <i>go</i> – there is no strength in them.
This mode of government must be understood as one in which all the rest of the Partzuf is complete except for the supports that give it the ability to stand. For Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet are the body of the Partzuf while Netzach and Hod give it support and Yesod and Malchut channel the influence to the lower worlds. Of the two supports, one is complete but the other is not. This is so that the world, while having a place for flaws, will not be destroyed. (For this reason Hod is still not completely repaired and as a result Netzach is also subject to flaws, because when one leg is flawed the second leg also cannot function properly.) This is also bound up with the various exiles – the main period of exile was in the fifth millennium corresponding to Hod. The flaw in Hod affects Yesod and Malchut, through which the influence is channeled. Netzach and Hod are the secret of the two Messiahs, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Pinchas</i> 252a). This requires a separate process of purification in addition to the first.
Thus indeed <b>…the initial purification is not truly complete…</b> Although at first sight it would appear that the entire purification was complete, nevertheless this is not so – because a faint trace of the desolation still exists: Hod-Yesod-Malchut have still not emerged completely from the desolation.
<b>…until the elapse of twenty-four months of the period of Suckling…</b> The fact that the child still suckles from his mother shows clearly that he is still in need of the flow of outside influence and still requires repair and purification. And thus in the world below the newborn baby has to develop his innate powers, and this he does during suckling.
<b>…because only then is the purification of Hod-Yesod-Malchut complete.</b>

Chapter 122

<i>Action of Zeir Anpin during Pregnancy, Suckling and Maturity</i>
<b>During the time of the Pregnancy action is not applicable to Zeir Anpin; rather, his lights are in the process of being built. As soon as he comes forth, his lights begin to act. However their actions are not complete but undergo a process of repair through Imma until they become complete at the time of complete Maturity.</b>
<i>Having examined these three periods in connection with the building of Zeir Anpin, we will now consider them in terms of his functioning.</i>
<b>During the time of the Pregnancy action is not applicable to Zeir Anpin…</b> Here below too we see the same: the child in his mother’s womb does not willfully <i>act</i>. <b>…rather, his lights are in the process of being built.</b> It is quite proper that he should not act, because this is the period in which he is built and not his time to act. This is also why he is hidden – he is inside Imma and is not visible, because he has no function at all but continues to be built.
<b>As soon as he comes forth, his lights begin to act.</b> <b>However their actions are not complete…</b> We see the same below: the newborn baby is active immediately after coming out, but his actions are incomplete and without full intention. Likewise above, the actions of the lights of Zeir Anpin are incomplete without the repairs they are to receive from the supernal lights.
<b>…but undergo a steady process of repair through Imma…</b> For all the repairs to Zeir Anpin come from Imma. The further each light extends, the greater the repair it brings. <b>…until they become complete at the time of complete Maturity.</b> For complete maturity is when the Mental Powers are fully functional, and so it is down below. By the time of maturity man has already reached his full mental powers.

Chapter 123

<i>The rule of Judgment is the cause of immaturity; its removal brings maturity.</i>
<b>Expanding Judgment causes darkness by preventing the lights from radiating widely with their full force. This must be made to subside and the Kindness fortified, and it continues to subside little by little, while the lights continue growing accordingly.</b>
<i>Having discussed immaturity and maturity, in which the lights are initially closed up and afterwards widen, we will now examine what causes the closure or opening.</i>
This proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: Expanding Judgment…</b> This is what causes closure in the lights. <b>Part 2: This must be made to subside…</b> This is its repair.
<b>Part 1: Expanding Judgment causes darkness…</b> This is obvious because Judgment (דין, <i>din</i>) means limitation and restraint, and by limiting the lights it causes darkness.
<b>…by preventing the lights from radiating widely… </b>When Judgment rules in a given light, this prevents its innate powers from expanding. <b>…with their full force.</b> This limitation is a lack of completeness, and when it departs, we say that the light in question becomes complete. This enables us to measure the different states of the lights from their inception until their completion – i.e. from the time the limitation has an effect until it departs altogether.<br> (Pregnancy and immaturity are thus explained as being the outcome of Judgment – for the active influence could have conferred maturity from the outset had not the power of Judgment prevented it. All the different states of deficiency and completeness depend on the intensification or removal of restraint, and can therefore be measured according to the degree of the restraint that rules or is negated.)
<b>Part 2: This must be made to subside…</b> We are taught that Judgment is like fire, which as we see either takes hold and flares up or subsides, as in “the fire subsided” (Numbers 11:2). See how all this is found in man down below: the fire of young people burns very strongly and they do not have much mercy. The older they become, the more this fire subsides and they become filled with mercy. Thus the elder is full of mercy, because the anger has already calmed down. When Judgment subsides, it does not cease altogether but is diminished.
<b>…and the Kindness fortified…</b> As the force of Judgment subsides, so the Partzuf increasingly shines out with Kindness. If Judgment had been made to subside all at once, all the lights would have immediately brought forth all their powers at once, leading to instant maturity. However, this is not the way it is, because the gradual order is preserved throughout everything. Accordingly the Judgment subsides gradually, as the proposition goes on to state.
<b>…and it continues to subside little by little…</b> This is also the mystery of how the Mental Powers of immaturity are pushed down from the head of Zeir Anpin into his body, and with each successive stage in their descent mature Mental Powers enter in their place, as discussed in the teachings of the ARI (<i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar HaMochin deKatnut</i> ch. 3).
<b>…while the lights continue growing accordingly.</b> For maturity comes about through the limbs growing, and this they do only to the extent that the Judgment subsides within – allowing them to expand their rule accordingly.

Chapter 124

<big><strong>Daat of Zeir Anpin (Openings 124-126)</strong></big>
<i>Daat expands through the whole of Zeir Anpin, while Chochmah and Binah do not.</i>
<b>The essence of the entire governmental order of Zeir Anpin lies in Daat, which is the offspring that emerges through the power of all the repairs instituted through Chochmah and Binah. Accordingly Daat can spread further than all the other Mental Powers. For the other Mental Powers remain within their vessels since it is enough that they exist in Zeir Anpin and stand in their respective columns, whereas Daat can spread even in the other columns on all the different levels.</b>
<i>Following our general explanation of the repair of Zeir Anpin and how his lights expand, we will now go into further detail about one light that has to expand more than the others. </i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The essence…</b> This presents the concept of Daat. <b>Part 2: Accordingly Daat can spread…</b> This explains why Daat spreads further than the others.
<b>Part 1: The essence of the entire governmental order of Zeir Anpin lies in Daat…</b> As discussed earlier, the governmental order is arranged in such a way that Zeir Anpin – the Six Directions – is the root of all the creations (see Opening 115). Zeir Anpin includes all the proper attributes with which to govern all the different creations. Nevertheless, this is not sufficient for the governmental order to be complete. For Zeir Anpin to fulfill his purpose, Abba and Imma must be engrafted in him. This is accomplished through the two Mental Powers of Chochmah and Binah, each of which makes preparations for the repairs required in Zeir Anpin in order to bring the governmental order to perfection. Chochmah and Binah make the preparations, while Daat carries them out. Indeed the true gain accruing to Zeir Anpin from this engrafting in him of Abba and Imma is his Daat.
<b>…which is the offspring that emerges through the power of all the repairs instituted through Chochmah and Binah.</b> For this engrafting is surely carried out in order to produce some result. First it must be carried out, and afterwards comes the fruit – the gain it brings. The purpose of Abba and Imma becoming engrafted in Zeir Anpin is to give him his Chochmah and Binah. Thus the very presence of Chochmah and Binah in Zeir Anpin signifies that Abba and Imma are engrafted in Zeir Anpin and are part of the intrinsic law of that Chochmah and Binah.
The functions they later perform are subject to Zeir Anpin’s intrinsic nature, which is determined by Daat – his inner soul or pnimiyut. For the functions of Zeir Anpin are not the direct outcome of his Chochmah and Binah, which contain what Abba and Imma give him closed up in their vessels. It is only through Daat, which is the offspring of Chochmah and Binah, that Zeir Anpin carries out his own intrinsic functions. Zeir Anpin’s Chochmah signifies and includes everything that Abba does, his Binah signifies and includes everything that Imma does, while the offspring that comes forth from all that Abba and Imma do is Daat.
Thus all the Mental Powers conferred by Abba in all their aspects are seen only in Zeir Anpin’s Chochmah and all those conferred by Imma in all aspects are seen only in Binah, while Zeir Anpin’s own aspects as acquired through the repairs received from Abba and Imma are seen in his Daat. For this reason the <i>Idra Zuta</i> (291a) states that Zeir Anpin is Daat, because Daat is the inner soul – pnimiyut – of Zeir Anpin.
Indeed these three Sefirot of Chochmah, Binah and Daat that we see in Zeir Anpin are the foundation of the entire governmental order, which depends upon the repair carried out by Abba and that carried out by Imma as well as upon Zeir Anpin as repaired through the two of them, this being Daat. When one of these three Sefirot prevails and shines with particular strength, Zeir Anpin is drawn accordingly. If the prevailing Sefirah is Chochmah, Abba’s repairs hold sway and Zeir Anpin is drawn after Abba. If it is Binah, Imma’s repairs hold sway and Zeir Anpin is drawn after Imma, whereas if Daat rules, Zeir Anpin in his own intrinsic aspects holds sway. Likewise the arrangements whereby these three Sefirot spread follow the same principle: Abba repairs Zeir Anpin’s right column and Imma the left, while the overall functioning of Zeir Anpin is through Daat.
Nevertheless Zeir Anpin’s Chochmah, Binah and Daat are found to be double in the sense that he has Chochmah-Binah-Daat from both Abba and Imma. The reason is because these three Sefirot are found in Zeir Anpin by virtue of the fact that Abba rectifies Zeir Anpin and Imma rectifies Zeir Anpin – and thus Abba repairs all three and Imma repairs all three. Thus we say that the repair of Chochmah is complete and likewise the repair of Binah is complete, and thus Zeir Anpin is fully repaired, being in possession of all three, which automatically completes the repair of his own Daat.
<b>Part 2: Accordingly Daat can spread further than all the other Mental Powers. </b>The spread of Daat comes about through the spread of the Five Kindnesses to all the Sefirot of Zeir Anpin and of the Five Strengths to those of Nukva, as will be discussed in due course (see Opening 126).
<b>For the other Mental Powers…</b> When we consider the way things are ordered in the light of our discussion above, we can see that once Abba and Imma are engrafted in Zeir Anpin’s Chochmah and Binah there is no need for them to spread. It is enough that they are present and <b>…remain within their vessels since it is enough that they exist in Zeir Anpin… </b>– for this is the way of the Mental Powers when they are present – <b>…and stand in their respective columns...</b> Certainly all aspects of Abba incline to the right and all aspects of Imma to the left, and these two therefore remain in their vessels according to the law of the Mental Powers. Since they are higher lights that come to direct Zeir Anpin, they are too exalted to function without being clothed in a vessel, and must therefore remain hidden and concealed. This is why they are present in a garb – each in its own column – in the vessels of Netzach and Hod of Abba and Imma respectively.
The statement <b>“it is enough that they exist in Zeir Anpin”</b> means is that it is not necessary for them to spread but simply to be present as they are in their own intrinsic nature. Accordingly they do not radiate to the outside at all except what they can radiate through their vessels, because the function generated through them does not take place in them but in Daat, which is the overall function that emerges as a result. Accordingly, they are merely present. Daat, however, which is the offspring that emerges out of all this, must necessarily spread – for the <i>result</i> of this engrafting of Abba and Imma does indeed spread through the whole of Zeir Anpin, all of which is greatly affected as a result.
<b>…whereas Daat can spread even in the other columns…</b> The expansion that might seem to have been required in Chochmah and Binah all takes place in Daat, because Daat is the offspring of Chochmah and Binah that spreads through everything, and indeed Daat truly extends through all the levels of Zeir Anpin <b>…on all the different levels.</b> Thus the Five Kindnesses of Daat extend even to Keter, as explained in the Kabbalistic writings.

Chapter 125

<i>Interrelation of Zeir Anpin and Nukva in the developmental chain and the governmental order</i>
<b>According to the order of the Sefirot as built through Chochmah and Binah, Zeir Anpin consists of nine Sefirot while Nukva is the tenth. However in the governmental order of Daat they stand parallel, one to the right and one to the left. This is the mystery of the Five Kindnesses and Five Strengths through which Daat divides up between them equally.</b>
<i>Having discussed Daat in general terms, we will now examine its Five Kindnesses and Five Strengths.</i>
The proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: According to the order… Part 2: This is the mystery…</b>
<b>Part 1: According to the order of the Sefirot…</b> i.e. in terms of the number of levels that make up the developmental chain.<b> …as built through Chochmah and Binah…</b> For the building of Zeir Anpin is through Chochmah and Binah – the Pregnancy and Birth of Zeir Anpin come about through Abba and Imma. Even when Abba and Imma enter and become engrafted in Zeir Anpin, this does not change anything in regard to Nukva being the tenth Sefirah of Zeir Anpin.
<b>Zeir Anpin consists of nine Sefirot while Nukva is the tenth.</b> For Zeir Anpin is considered as ten when we reckon Keter-Chochmah-Binah. It can likewise be said that Zeir Anpin is Six Directions while Nukva ranks as seventh after them. This is during immaturity, when Zeir Anpin has only six Sefirot and Nukva is considered the seventh – just as she is considered tenth to Zeir Anpin when he attains his maturity: Nukva is always considered the last Sefirah of Zeir Anpin and is thus only one Sefirah after all those of Zeir Anpin.
<b>However in the governmental order of Daat…</b> i.e. when it comes to the way things are actually governed, which depends on Daat <b>…they stand parallel, one to the right and one to the left.</b> The root from which influence descends to the world is ordered in such a way that Zeir Anpin with his MaH stands on the foundation of Kindness while Nukva with her BaN stands on the foundation of Judgment. This is alluded to in the rabbinic saying that “the man secretes the white substance and the woman the red” (<i>Niddah</i> 31a). Likewise it says: “My hand has laid the foundation of the earth and My right hand has spanned the heavens: when I call to them they stand up together” (Isaiah 48:13). Our Rabbis commented on this that they are balanced one against the other (<i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 1:15). <br> (Although in the chain of development Nukva, as the receiver, is tenth, when it comes to the government of the world, God gave man, the receiver, equal partnership – in that man’s service, the “female waters”, are instrumental in eliciting God’s influence, the “male waters”. Thus in the actual order of government Zeir and Nukva are parallel.)
<b>Part 2: This is the mystery of the Five Kindnesses and Five Strengths…</b> This balance of male and female is attributed to Daat and not to any other Sefirah, for only through Daat does the governmental order extend evenly. In the actual functioning of the governmental order – through Daat – all the nine Sefirot of Zeir Anpin have the same weight as Malchut by itself – i.e. five against five.
<b>…through which Daat divides up between them… </b>As already explained, the Kindnesses spread in Zeir Anpin and the Strengths in Nukva, and from this point of view they are equal and parallel. <b>…equally.</b> For the intention is to make them equal and divide the government between them on an equal basis.

Chapter 126

<i>The spread of Daat through the body</i>
<b>The nature of Daat is to extend through the body, and when it descends uncovered and revealed, it does so in its own column first so as to fulfill its function there. We then say that the Mental Powers, through which Imma rests upon and directs Zeir Anpin, are fixed in him. Afterwards Daat ascends once more. By then Chochmah-Binah-Daat have already been fixed in Zeir Anpin and accordingly Daat ascends to that point.</b>
<i>Having discussed how Daat must extend through the whole of Zeir Anpin, we will now explain the path by which it spreads.</i>
<b>The nature of Daat is to extend through the body…</b> This should be clear in the light of what has already been said about Daat. Initially Daat must spread in its own center column and its own vessel – Yesod of Imma – in just the same way as Chochmah and Binah spread in their own vessels. From there Daat must later spread along its own unique path, whereby it emerges from the vessel of Yesod of Imma and extends uncovered and revealed. Accordingly the vessel of Yesod of Imma from which Daat is revealed consists of only one and a half joints, because its purpose is to reveal the lights. Initially they have to be within it, included there in the top joint of Yesod, which is clothed in the head of Zeir Anpin. It is in the second joint that the revelation takes place, this being one of the exit vessels discussed earlier in connection with the sensory organs (see Openings 32 &amp; 34).
The order is therefore as follows: First come the beginnings of Daat, which in the rectified Zeir Anpin derives from Imma, and its place above lies in the upper joint of Yesod of Imma, which is in the head of Zeir Anpin. Afterwards, when it spreads to reach another joint, it has the added aspect of being revealed, yet it nevertheless completes its own column. Afterwards it returns from there and goes up to spread completely through the entire structure of Zeir Anpin in a revealed way, as the proposition later states.
<b>…and when it descends uncovered and revealed, it does so in its own column first so as to fulfill its function there. </b>Having gained the added aspect of being revealed, it first fulfills its own intrinsic functions in its own column.
<b>We then say that the Mental Powers, through which Imma rests upon and directs Zeir Anpin, are fixed in him.</b> Imma’s influence over Zeir Anpin divides into three columns which include all his nine Sefirot – which means that Imma influences all the different aspects of Zeir Anpin very evenly so as to be bound up with all his nine Sefirot, including the center column.
Everything we are presently discussing relates to the Mental Powers conferred by Imma, which are characterized by their differentiation into detail – and thus the Mental Powers conferred by Imma enter into Zeir Anpin in such a way that the nine joints into which Netzach-Hod-Yesod divide enter one by one in each year of immaturity (see <i>Etz Chayim</i>, <i>Shaar Derushey HaTzelem</i> 8).
This is not so in the case of the Mental Powers conferred on Zeir Anpin by Abba, which are characterized by their general nature. Thus in the teachings relating to Abba there is no mention either of the time of the entry of joints being governed by their number or of Daat of Abba extending through the body and returning up above as in the case of Imma. In the case of Abba the only differentiation is between the three overall Mental Powers, which enter in three years (between the ages of 15-18, after which Zeir Anpin receives the two encompassing lights of Abba by the age of 20). This is not so in the case of the Mental Powers conferred by Imma, where each detail is revealed individually during the years of Suckling up till 13 – time of the First Maturity – and in the first two years thereafter.
<b>Afterwards Daat ascends once more.</b> Only after completing its own column does Daat ascend again. The ascent of Daat thus takes place only after it has gone down to the lowest level.
<b>By then Chochmah-Binah-Daat have already been fixed in Zeir Anpin…</b> As long as Daat was still going down, before completing its descent, Chochmah-Binah-Daat were not yet fixed in Zeir Anpin. For their presence indicates the way Imma rests over and influences Zeir Anpin, which intrinsically is only Six Directions, and this influence is not a permanent fixture in Zeir Anpin until all the Mental Powers have spread to all his joints. This is completed as soon as Daat has also completed its descent to the bottom of its own column. When it turns back to go up again, it encounters the Mental Powers already fixed in Zeir Anpin, and the Five Kindnesses of Daat then extend to them as well. <b>…and accordingly Daat ascends to that point.</b>

<big><strong>Zeir Anpin’s Mental States (Openings 127-130)</strong></big>
<i>The Inner and Encompassing Mental Powers: the Tzelem</i>
<b>The entire array of Mental Powers with which Abba and Imma adorn Zeir Anpin all make up one entity of Ten Sefirot. This entity is unsuited to enter into Zeir Anpin because of the disparity in their respective levels – with the sole exception of its Netzach-Hod-Yesod – while the rest stays outside encompassing Zeir Anpin above his head. This entire entity is the TZeLeM (צלם). The letter Tzaddi of TzeLeM is the Netzach-Hod-Yesod: this specifically is what extends to all levels of Zeir Anpin. What remains outside is the Lamed-Mem. These do not need to spread; rather they are only in the mystery of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, which are the basis of the entire governmental order.</b>
<i>Having discussed the Mental Powers that enter into Zeir Anpin, we will now discuss a related matter: the encompassing levels above them.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The entire array…</b> This presents a fundamental premise about the Mental Powers. <b>Part 2: This entire entity…</b> This explains this premise in detail.
<b>Part 1: The entire array of Mental Powers with which Abba and Imma adorn Zeir Anpin…</b> Every aspect of the supreme lights divides into ten parts – Ten Sefirot. Thus the Mental Powers that actually enter into Zeir Anpin certainly divide into ten, because they enter into all his Ten Sefirot. (These are really nine since Malchut of Zeir Anpin is merely an adjunct of his Yesod – its Corona – while the essential Malchut of Zeir Anpin is Nukva.)
However, if we examine all these ten in relation to another phenomenon found in Zeir Anpin – his encompassing lights – we find that these ten (Netzach-Hod-Yesod as they divide up into the Ten Sefirot of the interior lights) are only one part of a single whole entity: the Ten Sefirot of the overall Mental Powers, which divide into two parts. This entity as a whole is the crowning adornment (עטרת, <i>ateret</i>) that Zeir Anpin receives from Abba or Imma. The two parts of which it consists are the Interior and Encompassing Mental Powers. When we take them together as two parts of the one overall entity, we divide the entire entity into only Ten Sefirot, whose Netzach-Hod-Yesod then divide up in turn into the Ten Sefirot that actually enter into Zeir Anpin, while its Chochmah-Binah-Daat and Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet remain outside.
<b>…all make up one entity of Ten Sefirot.</b> The proof of this is that as soon as we examine these encompassing levels, we see that they too are drawn to Zeir Anpin from Abba and Imma in order to adorn him with their crowns. We can thus immediately infer that the entire array of Mental Powers make up a single overall entity of which the internal and encompassing lights are two parts.
<b>This entity is unsuited to enter into Zeir Anpin because of the disparity in their respective levels…</b> Only Netzach-Hod-Yesod of this entity are on the same level as Zeir Anpin, enabling him to receive them as his interior Neshamah. But the power of its Chochmah-Binah-Daat and Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet is in excess of what is needed for the Neshamah in Zeir Anpin’s vessel – because everything follows the principle of gradation.
<b>…with the sole exception of its Netzach-Hod-Yesod…</b> For the same relationship always applies whereby the lowest part of the upper level is what becomes the interior soul of the lower level. Only Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the upper Partzuf can enter into the lower Partzuf because this alone can descend to the level of the lower Partzuf so as to serve as its inner soul. Thus only Netzach-Hod-Yesod of the overall entity enter into Zeir Anpin.
<b>…while the rest stays outside…</b> Zeir Anpin is unable to receive it within him because the light would be too close to the vessel and in excess of what the vessel is capable of concealing and holding within limits.
<b>…encompassing Zeir Anpin above his head.</b> Although unable to enter, the light shines over him and does not leave him, except that it does not come as close as the inner light but stands like one guarding him from above.
<b>Part 2: This entire entity is the TZeLeM.</b> It is called the Tzelem (“image”) because this is none other than the “image of God” in which Adam was made (Genesis 1:27), and the very letters of the word signify the intrinsic essence of this entity.
<b>The letter Tzaddi of TZeLeM is the Netzach-Hod-Yesod…</b> For the three letters of the word Tzelem signify the three levels into which its Ten Sefirot divide. The lowest is that of Netzach-Hod-Yesod, which is here called the Interior Mental Powers. The second level is that of Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet: this is the First Encompassing Level. The third level of the Ten Sefirot of Tzelem is that of Keter-Chochmah-Binah-Daat, which is the Second Encompassing Level.
<b>…this specifically is what extends to all levels of Zeir Anpin.</b> This is shown by the numerical value of the letters themselves, because the Interior Mental Powers spread into the nine Sefirot of Zeir Anpin in order to direct them all, and this is signified in the letter Tzaddi, which has the numerical value of 90.
<b>What remains outside is the Lamed-Mem.</b> The Lamed (=30) signifies Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet, while the Mem (=40) signifies Keter-Chochmah-Binah-Daat.
<b>These do not need to spread…</b> As we have said, Netzach-Hod-Yesod divide up into nine Sefirot through the mystery of Tzaddi. However these remain as they are – three as the Lamed and four as the Mem. For they cannot spread into the Ten Sefirot of Zeir Anpin but rather they stand as whole entities, though still ordered on the basis of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy. For Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet clearly stand on the basis of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, and the same is true of Keter-Chochmah-Binah-Daat, for in this case the intermediary divides into two – an upper one, Keter, and a lower one, Daat, which consists of both Kindnesses and Strengths. Thus the proposition goes on to state:
<b>…rather they are only in the mystery of Kindness-Judgment-Mercy, which are the basis of the entire governmental order.</b> For they cannot be any less than this as they encompass the entire governmental order.

Chapter 128

<i>Abba and Imma divide up into the First and Second Israel Sabba and Tevunah.</i>
<b>Abba and Imma must at times for Zeir Anpin’s sake divide up their lowest part – which is Israel Sabba and Tevunah – into a further subdivision. This is because of the need for gradation, so that Zeir Anpin should only receive the lights at a low strength, and all the other aspects of Zeir Anpin are governed accordingly. By the principle of gradation it is not proper that he should receive any more than this at that time. This division produces the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah.</b>
<i>Following our discussion of the Mental Powers, we will now explain the way they are given to Zeir Anpin by Abba and Imma.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: Abba and Imma must…</b> The Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah are a subdivision of the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah. <b>Part 2: This is because…</b> This explains the reason for this subdivision.
<b>Part 1: Abba and Imma must… divide up their lowest part – which is Israel Sabba and Tevunah…</b> Altogether the main Partzufim make up a total of five, which embody the entire array of the Ten Sefirot of the world in question. (Arich Anpin is Keter, Abba is Chochmah and Imma is Binah, while Zeir Anpin is Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet-Netzach-Hod-Yesod and Nukva is Malchut.) However, Abba and Imma subdivide their Sefirot into whatever levels are required. Thus Abba, the First Israel Sabba and the Second Israel Sabba are all Abba, except that when certain separate functions and powers are given to his Malchut, we find these two other Partzufim – although Abba is the one that is actually operating. The same applies to Imma in relation to the First and Second Tevunah.
<b>…for Zeir Anpin’s sake…</b> This is done only to bring the Mental Powers to the right level, as the proposition states below.
<b>…at times…</b> For it is not so all the time. Only in the First Maturity do the Partzufim of the Second (or “Secondary”) Israel Sabba and Tevunah operate, while in the Second Maturity it is the Partzufim of the First (or “Primary”) Israel Sabba and Tevunah that operate.
<b>…into a further subdivision.</b> In other words, Malchut of Israel Sabba-Tevunah becomes a separate Partzuf – the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah.
<b>Part 2: This is because of the need for gradation, so that Zeir Anpin should only receive the lights at a low strength…</b> In other words, Zeir Anpin receives only the offspring of the offspring – the lowest part of the lowest part. For Malchut of Abba and Imma is their lowest part, but even this Zeir Anpin cannot receive in its entirety, only the lowest part of it – Malchut of Malchut, which is the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah. These become the Tzelem of Zeir Anpin.
And even that Tzelem does not enter into Zeir Anpin’s interior with the exception of its lowest part, the Tzaddi – Malchut of Malchut of Abba and Imma. Yet the purpose of this gradation is obvious. For Zeir Anpin can only ever receive his interior soul – even in the Second Maturity – from Malchut of Abba and Imma, because only the lowest part of the upper Partzuf can become the interior soul of the lower Partzuf, and in this case Israel Sabba-Tevunah are the lowest part of the upper Partzuf. Even this Zeir Anpin can only receive at certain times, and thus there are times when he receives more and times when he receives less. Accordingly there had to be a gradation whereby at a time when he receives less he only takes the lowest part of this Malchut, whereas at a time when he receives more he takes the whole of this Malchut.
This too is through a gradual process and not by going from one extreme to the other so as to have either the whole of Malchut or only the lowest part of it. After receiving the lowest part, Zeir Anpin ascends gradually level by level until he receives it all. First he receives Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet of this Malchut and afterwards Chochmah-Binah-Daat. We then say that Zeir Anpin has attained the Second Maturity. For with the entry of Chochmah-Binah-Daat, the entry of the whole of this Malchut is complete – the entire Tzaddi of the Tzelem is within Zeir Anpin. All the upper levels of the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah then remain as his Lamed-Mem through the mystery of the Second Maturity.
These are the ascents that take place on Shabbat night and Shabbat day. On Shabbat night the encompassing levels of Lamed become internal in Zeir Anpin and he is then between the First and Second Maturity. Afterwards on Shabbat day the Mem of the Tzelem also enters into Zeir Anpin’s interior. He thus has the whole of Malchut (i.e. the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah) – the Tzaddi of the Tzelem – and this is called the Second Maturity. Afterwards there are further ascents, and these are real ascents because Zeir Anpin then rises higher than his proper level. These are the other ascents of Shabbat day. Each one of these times has its effects on the governmental order, because as you know, there is nothing that does not have a purpose.
One could ask why no mention is made of any other stage of maturity between the First and Second Maturity. The answer is that in truth it would not be fitting for there to be more than two kinds of Mental Powers – either from Abba and Imma (i.e. as provided by the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah, which are Malchut of Abba and Imma) or from the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah (which are Malchut of the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah), as will be discussed in the following Opening. Accordingly in the middle ascent there is not as yet any change in the actual Mental Powers but only an addition. The Mental Powers are still attributed to the First Maturity – as provided only by the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah – except that there is now the addition of these encompassing levels.
The only purpose of the internalization of the encompassing level of the Lamed is that Zeir Anpin should attain the Mental Powers conferred by Abba and Imma. But as long as he has not actually attained them he cannot be said to have emerged from the First Maturity. This is similar to what we said in regard to the transition from Immaturity to Maturity – that even though the Mental Powers are in the process of coming, the term Maturity applies only after they complete their entry, while the period in between is still termed that of Suckling, albeit with an addition (see Opening 121).
<b>…and all the other aspects of Zeir Anpin are governed accordingly.</b> As already discussed, the strength of the rest of the body depends upon the strength of the Mental Powers.
<b>By the principle of gradation it is not proper that he should receive any more than this at that time.</b> (Malchut of Abba and Imma subdivides at that time because Zeir Anpin is unable to receive <i>all</i> of Malchut of Abba and Imma, i.e. the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah, but only Malchut of the latter, i.e. the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah.) This is something that changes at different times: the First and Second Maturity come about because of the unique nature of the holy days as opposed to the weekdays.<br> There is thus a difference between the levels of Pregnancy, Suckling and having Mental Powers on the one hand and the First and Second Maturity on the other. The periods of Pregnancy, Suckling and Mental Immaturity come to complete the building of the lights so that they can function according to the needs of the world. However the First and Second Maturity come when the lights are already built and complete but can function with either more or less strength. We must call this a difference in the degree of their importance and functioning.
This is similar to man’s additional Shabbat soul. The building is already complete without it and the additional soul adds nothing to man’s body or physical functioning. What it adds is only an enhancement of status and splendor, as will be discussed in its appropriate place below (see Opening 132).
<b>This division produces the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah.</b> This is as discussed above.
It could be asked why all the Partzufim change their names when they undergo a change of function, while these are simply called the <i>Second</i> Israel Sabba-Tevunah. The reason is that the function of the latter is identical with that of the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah – albeit on a lower level. Both are what Abba and Imma give to Zeir Anpin, but when he can only receive from the very end he receives from the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah. The latter are a part of Malchut that carries out the same function as the whole although on a lower level. And when they are not needed they simply become included in the higher level: in the Second Maturity, the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah become absorbed in the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah. This is not so in the case of the other Partzufim, each of which has its own distinct function. The proof is that at no time do the other Partzufim cease to exist through being absorbed in others as happens in this case.

Chapter 129

<i>Zeir Anpin’s First and Second Maturity</i>
<b>Abba and Imma must clothe within their Malchut – which is called the back parts of their Netzach-Hod-Yesod – the adornments that they have to give to Zeir Anpin, these being his Mental Powers. This is similar to all other cases where a higher Partzuf gives Mental Powers to a lower one. And when Abba and Imma themselves give the Mental Powers to Zeir Anpin with no further subdivision, their Malchut clothes itself in Zeir Anpin’s Tzelem, and the lowest part of this Malchut becomes interior in Zeir Anpin while the two upper parts are encompassing levels. This is called the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah.</b>
<b>When the principle of gradation requires a further division, it is Israel Sabba and Tevunah that give the Mental Powers to Zeir Anpin through their Malchut, which is called the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah, and the latter clothe themselves in Zeir Anpin’s Tzelem in the same order as above.</b>
<b>These are called two levels of Maturity – the First and the Second. The First Maturity is when Zeir Anpin receives from the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah; the Second Maturity is when he receives from Abba and Imma without the above subdivision, and this is a far greater power.</b>
<i>Having explained how Abba and Imma subdivide to produce the First and Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah, we will now complete the discussion by explaining how this results in Zeir Anpin’s First and Second Maturity.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: Abba and Imma must…</b> This explains where the root of the First and Second Maturity lies. <b>Part 2: And when…</b> This explains the First and Second Maturity in themselves.
<b>Part 1: Abba and Imma must clothe…</b> The same order is followed in every case where a higher Partzuf gives Mental Powers to a lower Partzuf: the moving cause – the higher Partzuf – must clothe its own bottom part with the lights that have to become interior in the lower Partzuf. This is a necessary preparation to enable the lower Partzuf to be properly governed by the higher Partzuf by bringing the latter’s lights down to a suitable level.
<b>…within their Malchut – which is called the back parts of their Netzach-Hod-Yesod…</b> When we speak of Netzach-Hod-Yesod we actually mean Malchut behind Netzach-Hod-Yesod, because that is where its place is, and Netzach-Hod-Yesod are drawn after Malchut because their role is to channel influence thereto. Thus when we say Netzach-Hod-Yesod we really mean Malchut behind Netzach-Hod-Yesod and Netzach-Hod-Yesod with it. For the Chariot is so arranged that Malchut is attached behind Tiferet, since the four key Sefirot are Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet-Malchut. Netzach-Hod-Yesod emerge from Tiferet only for the sake of Malchut – to connect it to Tiferet – and accordingly they are called the pillars of Malchut, “Yachin” and “Boaz”. (This makes it possible to reconcile sources that refer to Israel Sabba-Tevunah as Malchut of Abba and Imma with those that refer to them as Netzach-Hod-Yesod of Abba and Imma.)
<b>…the adornments that they have to give to Zeir Anpin, these being his Mental Powers.</b> These adornments comprise the entire Tzelem in all its parts, i.e. all the Mental Powers.
<b>This is similar to all other cases where a higher Partzuf gives Mental Powers to a lower one.</b> This is not specific to Zeir Anpin but applies to all the Partzufim.
<b>Part 2: And when Abba and Imma themselves give the Mental Powers to Zeir Anpin…</b> It is in Abba and Imma’s intrinsic nature to divide into two Partzufim through the mystery of Arich Anpin’s Kindnesses and Strengths, which are half covered and half revealed (see Opening 110). From then on either one of these two parts – either the upper part, namely Abba and Imma, or the lower part, namely Israel Sabba-Tevunah – may be the primary agent of this function of giving Zeir Anpin his Mental Powers.
Indeed the intrinsic function of Israel Sabba-Tevunah is to enable the Mental Powers to extend until they reach their place. (Israel Sabba-Tevunah are not qualitatively different Partzufim from those of Abba and Imma; rather, they are an extension of Abba and Imma on a lower level.) Thus we see that sometimes the Mental Powers may be given by the root itself and sometimes by the extension of the root – i.e. sometimes by Abba and Imma (in the Second Maturity) and sometimes by Israel Sabba-Tevunah (in the First Maturity). These are two different levels of Mental Powers. Thus the proposition goes on to say:
<b>…with no further subdivision…</b> When Abba and Imma themselves give Zeir Anpin his mental powers (i.e. in the Second Maturity), there is no need for Israel Sabba-Tevunah to divide into a separate Partzuf by themselves. Rather, they are considered as merely Malchut of Abba and Imma – for they are only called an independent Partzuf when they are the primary agent in giving the Mental Powers, because they are then given power in their own right. And thus:
<b>…their Malchut clothes itself in Zeir Anpin’s Tzelem, and the lowest part of this Malchut becomes interior in Zeir Anpin while the two upper parts are encompassing levels.</b> Israel Sabba-Tevunah are then considered as Abba and Imma’s Malchut, which itself divides up into Ten Sefirot until it becomes clothed in all of the Tzelem. It is clothed therein as explained in connection with the mystery of the Tzaddi, the Lamed and the Mem (see Opening 127). <b>This is called the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah.</b>
<b>When the principle of gradation requires a further division…</b> Israel Sabba-Tevunah are not considered a separate Partzuf when their role is to enter into Zeir Anpin (i.e. in the Second Maturity, when Abba and Imma give the mental powers and Israel Sabba-Tevunah, as Malchut of Abba and Imma, wear the Tzelem). On the contrary, Israel Sabba-Tevunah are considered a separate Partzuf only when they confer their own Mental Powers (i.e. in the First Maturity), when the principle of gradation requires that the Mental Powers can come only from the branch and not from the root. Then they are called the First Israel Sabba-Tevunah, and it is they that then give Zeir Anpin the Mental Powers through <i>their</i> Malchut – which is called the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah. Thus the proposition continues:
<b>…it is Israel Sabba and Tevunah that give the Mental Powers to Zeir Anpin through their Malchut, which is called the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah, and the latter clothe themselves in Zeir Anpin’s Tzelem in the same order as above. These are called two levels of Maturity…</b> They are two kinds of Maturity, yet they both follow the same pattern. The Mental Powers that come from Abba and Imma (i.e. in the Second Maturity) are primary, as opposed to the Mental Powers given by Israel Sabba-Tevunah, which are the bottom part.
<b>…the First and the Second. The First Maturity is when Zeir Anpin receives from the Second Israel Sabba-Tevunah; the Second Maturity is when he receives from Abba and Imma without the above subdivision…</b> For they are counted in ascending order. <b>…and this is a far greater power.</b>

Chapter 130

<i>Nukva is built separately with mitigated Strengths.</i>
<b>Nukva undergoes her own separate process of building through her Mental Powers so that they can repair all her different levels as required, some with Kindnesses and some with Strengths. This is because of the need for Nukva to embody Judgment – but that it should be mitigated so that she can receive the Kindnesses from Zeir Anpin.</b>
<i>Having completed our discussion of Zeir Anpin, we will now discuss Nukva.</i>
<b>Nukva undergoes her own separate process of building …</b> Despite the fact that, as discussed earlier (Opening 119), Zeir and Nukva grow together and she accompanies Zeir Anpin through all his different stages of Pregnancy, Suckling and Maturity, none of this is for the purpose of building Nukva, who requires a further separate process of building. Her being with him serves the repair that comes from their being joined and bound together, but this repair is almost entirely for the sake of Zeir Anpin, who as the giver of influence requires Nukva as his end level – the receiver – in order to complete his Sefirot.
However, in order to fulfill her own function Nukva requires a separate process of building – for two reasons:
1. Nukva’s function is not at all equal to that of Zeir Anpin, and in each case the repairs must correspond to the functions of the lights. The two repairs cannot be said to be a single process in which each is built with its own unique aspects, because this is not the purpose of Nukva accompanying Zeir Anpin in each stage of his building. The intention is rather that he should be built in a way that suits his role as giver of influence to Nukva, who thus has to be bound with Zeir Anpin in each of these different stages.
Thus while Nukva is involved in all Zeir Anpin’s repairs, she afterwards requires a separate process of building suited to her unique function in the government. Nukva cannot be built in one process together with Zeir Anpin since this would be of no benefit and there is no connection between the unique aspects of Nukva’s own building and Zeir Anpin’s times of Pregnancy, Birth, Immaturity and Maturity. During these periods Nukva does indeed ascend successively with Zeir Anpin from Yesod to Daat, but this is only for his sake.
2. The second reason that they cannot be built together is that Nukva has to be built by Zeir Anpin himself, and this is only possible after he is already repaired and fit to build her.
<b>…through her Mental Powers…</b> i.e. through Netzach-Hod-Yesod of Zeir Anpin, which build Nukva as required to suit her function.
<b>…so that they can repair all her different levels as required…</b> There is no need for symmetry with Zeir Anpin in this. Quite the contrary, Nukva requires her own unique repair to suit her intrinsic structure.
<b>…some with Kindnesses and some with Strengths.</b> The Strengths spread only in the center column, while the Kindnesses spread in the other two columns, right and left (see <i>Pitchey Chochmah VaDaat</i> ch. 75).
<b>This is because of the need for Nukva to embody Judgment – but that it should be mitigated…</b> In truth both these two aspects are required in Nukva in order for her to govern properly. She has to embody Judgment, because the very foundation of Nukva is the rule of Judgment – as required in this world – through the power of BaN and the Strengths of Daat. On the other hand Nukva’s Judgments must be mitigated, for it is not fitting to run the world with Harsh Judgment since that is <i>destructive</i> Judgment, whereas the world needs <i>mitigated</i> Judgment – the sweetened Judgment that gives rise to joy and the intense excitement of love, as explained in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Idra Zuta</i> 296b; see Opening 52).
<b>…so that she can receive the Kindnesses from Zeir Anpin.</b> Nukva is given these Kindnesses only to mitigate her strict Judgments but not in order that she should rule with Kindness, for that is not her purpose. It is when Judgment is sweet in its intrinsic nature that it seeks its own mitigation through joining with Kindness. (In the building of Nukva, her Strengths – which extend in her center column – are sweetened through the radiation of Netzach-Hod of Zeir Anpin in the two side columns, and this is what mitigates the intrinsic nature of Nukva, making her long to receive Kindnesses through coupling with Zeir Anpin.)
For all that is deficient seeks fulfillment – a hungry person wants to eat. But when a person’s proper nature is impaired, he no longer seeks fulfillment, as in the case of sick people who are repulsed by food. Likewise Harsh Judgment is darkened by the accusations of the Other Side and does not seek to be sweetened. However, when Judgment is mitigated, it seeks to be sweetened. Then through the mystery of coupling Justice receives actual Kindnesses – i.e. Zeir Anpin’s Male Waters, as will be discussed below.

Chapter 131

<big><strong>Ascent and Descent of the Worlds (Openings 131-133)</strong></big>
<i>Different times of ascent and descent</i>
<b>The worlds were created in such a way as to be able to rise above their intrinsic level. Indeed this was the very purpose for which they went down ever since their first descent at the time of the breaking of the vessels – in order to ascend little by little until everything returns to the level of completeness as before the breakage. And now there are ascents and descents depending on the different times, in order to govern the worlds with the necessary measure of increase and decrease as required in any given circumstances.</b>
<i>Having discussed the building of both Zeir Anpin and Nukva, let us now examine the repairs and ascents they undergo.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>NOTE</small></b></sup><i class="footnote">The explanation of the building of Nukva in the previous Opening is followed in this and the next Opening by a discussion of Zeir Anpin’s maturity and various ascents – which do not depend on men’s deeds. Discussion of the Nukva – whose various states <i>do</i> depend on men’s deeds – is resumed in Opening 134.</i><b>The worlds were created in such a way as to be able to rise above their intrinsic level. </b>Men’s whole task is to elevate and enhance the status of the creation. For the creation was placed on the lowest level in order to allow destruction to rule over it – so that men would be able to repair the damage, thereby acquiring merit. Men’s merit and all their endeavors are bound up with elevating the creation to the highest level, rescuing it from destruction and ordering it in such a way as to prevent further damage.
This is the root of the ascents and descents discussed in connection with the Partzufim. When they rise above their lowest level to gain higher status, this is their ascent. When they go back down again, this is their descent. This is what causes the changing influences at different times in this world – on weekdays, Shabbat and other holidays etc.
<b>Indeed this was the very purpose for which they went down…</b> For had they been intrinsically lowly such as to require a change in their very nature in order to elevate them, it would have made man’s path very difficult. But that is not the case. On the contrary, they stem from a high root and descended only afterwards.  Man’s task is to raise them up as they were before their descent.
<b>…ever since their first descent at the time of the breaking of the vessels…</b> For afterwards there was a further descent when the moon was made smaller, and Adam’s sin was also a descent.
<b>…in order that they should ascend little by little until everything returns to the level of completeness as before the breakage.</b> This follows the principle that everything must be gradual and in stages.
<b>And now there are ascents and descents depending on the different times…</b> In the meantime there are both ascents and descents. For as long as the worlds have not reached their highest possible level they can still ascend and descend. No level is permanently attained through a one-time ascent. Time factors play a large part in this. As long as the ascent to a given level is not permanent it is possible to rise to and fall from it time after time.
These ascents and descents create differences between the weekdays and Shabbat and all the other significant days and times, as well as between the nights and the days of the actual holidays themselves. Shabbat and the holidays are all times of ascent, and then afterwards the cycle swings around into a descent. The different ascents and descents either enhance or lessen the status of the creations (and thus the descent on weekdays represents not a flaw as such but rather a lessening in status.)
<b>…in order to govern the worlds with the necessary measure of increase and decrease as required in any given circumstances.</b> The Supreme Thought has already calculated which ascent is necessary and which ascent is unnecessary at every juncture, instituting the different times accordingly. Everything is arranged to bring the world to perfect government through all the different changes in the times.

Chapter 132

<i>The difference between expansion and ascent</i>
<b>The Emanator, blessed be His name, instituted a certain law whereby the substance of the creations remains unchanged yet their soul may nevertheless be increased within them, giving them a higher status even though their body does not change. This is the Additional Soul given to man. Correspondingly in the higher realm too He instituted in the Sefirot the phenomenon whereby their exterior – which is the root of man’s body – receives an interior soul beyond what is due to it according to its intrinsic nature, and this is called an ascent for it. As long as it is in the process of receiving its due, this is called growth towards completion. What is above this is an ascent. There are various arrangements like these, for this is the source of the addition that comes at different times on weekdays, Shabbat and the other holidays.</b>
<i>Having introduced the subject of ascents and descents, we will now examine their nature.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The Emanator…</b> This explains the concept of the Additional Soul. <b>Part 2: Correspondingly…</b> This explains the corresponding ascents in the Sefirot.
<b>Part 1: The Emanator, blessed be His name, instituted a certain law…</b> This is something that we actually find in man here below, and from it we can understand the meaning of this ascent of the Partzufim, for what is hidden can be inferred from what is explicit.
<b>…whereby the substance of the creations remains unchanged yet their soul may nevertheless be increased within them, giving them a higher status…</b> For the quality of man’s soul determines his status.
<b>…even though their body does not change. This is the Additional Soul given to man.</b> Experience proves the existence of the Additional Soul (נפש יתירה, <i>nefesh yeteirah</i>) – another Neshamah that enters in addition to the first. This brings a great increase in status yet there is no change in the body.
<b>Part 2: Correspondingly in the higher realm too He instituted in the Sefirot the phenomenon…</b> This phenomenon must necessarily have a root in the higher realm, for there is nothing that does not have a root.
<b>…whereby their exterior – which is the root of man’s body – receives an interior soul…</b> This is what happens in the ascents of Shabbat and all the other ascents in which the interior and exterior are not renewed together but rather, the existing exterior receives a different interior. <b>…beyond what is due to it according to its intrinsic nature…</b> Even without this addition, the Partzuf already has full power on its level; the addition only increases its importance.
It could be objected that numerous differences exist between the Additional Soul as found here below and the root to which we have traced it in the world above.
(1) Here below the original soul does not leave the body. Rather, the two souls are present at one and the same time – whereas in the upper realm the ascending Partzuf gives its original interior to the Partzuf beneath it while itself rising up to receive a different interior.
(2) This leads to a further difficulty. Here below it is truly no problem if the body does not change. It simply stays as it was with the first soul, which does not leave it. However in the upper realm it would appear that there would have to be some change in the exterior. Since the Partzuf in question receives a new, different interior, should it not also receive a new exterior?
(3) In the upper realm there is indeed a change in the exterior as well. This is because in the upper realm the transition from Immaturity to Maturity and likewise every ascent involves new Pregnancy, Suckling and Mental Powers, as discussed in the teachings of the ARI. This implies that the entire structure is renewed, including the exterior.
A further problem is that we need to understand how in the upper realm the interior of Imma can become the interior of Zeir Anpin, given their different functions. Another problem is the very opposite of this: From where else <i>could</i> Zeir Anpin receive a new interior if not from the interior of the Partzuf above him, i.e. Imma?
In order to resolve these problems, it is necessary to understand the way in which the Supreme Lights affect man. It could have been that the actual substance (מציאות, <i>metziut</i>) of the Partzuf, i.e. Zeir Anpin, would itself have been literally renewed. In that case the change would have been in its exterior, which is vested with executive power, as explained earlier (see Opening 27) in connection with the functioning of the Line (the interior) through the Residue (the exterior). This would have given him an interior consonant with this intrinsic change in him. If that had been the case in the upper realm, there would also have to be a corresponding change in the substance of the body here below with the entry of the Additional Soul.
But in fact these ascents are such that the substance of the acting entity continues to exist just as it is and the increase it receives is only in power and strength.
Thus when Zeir Anpin ascends to receive Imma’s interior, this only means that he receives the light at great strength just as it radiates within Imma. However this light cannot give him Imma’s intrinsic essence. On the contrary, Imma’s inner power is certainly above the level of Zeir Anpin as is Imma herself. For Imma too has not changed her function, and what is left is only light in the sense of power – an increase of strength and power in the light of Zeir Anpin. But there is no change in Zeir Anpin’s intrinsic essence.
Even though in the upper realm each ascent involves phases of Pregnancy, Suckling and Mental Powers that also renew the exterior, they do not change the intrinsic law and essence of the Partzuf but rather they are stages in its development. Similarly below, the body does not need to change in order to receive those lights. Indeed, when the Additional Soul enters into man it certainly enters in stages – Pregnancy, Suckling and Mental Powers. However these are influences that man receives without undergoing any changes in his body – the exterior – because they do not change his intrinsic law but only give him greater power.
Thus we see that these ascents are such that in every case the exterior remains with its intrinsic functions unchanged, and what the ascending lower Partzuf takes from the upper Partzuf (i.e. what Zeir Anpin takes from Imma) or what the upper Partzuf takes in <i>its</i> ascent (i.e. what Imma takes for Zeir Anpin as she ascends) is still the same interior but with a stronger radiation.
When man’s Additional Soul enters him, his original soul functions only as if it is absorbed within the Additional Soul, which is the one that acts. However man does not exhibit the phenomenon whereby the ascending Partzuf leaves its original interior to the Partzuf below. Instead, in man the first soul remains absorbed and hidden within the Extra Soul.
In making inferences from the lower world to the upper world, what must always be understood is the interrelationship between one aspect and another on their level. There is no parallel between what exists above and what exists in this world except with respect to the interrelationship between different aspects. However the two realms are quite different in their intrinsic nature.
<b>…and this is called an ascent for it.</b> It is an ascent as distinct from all the levels of maturity prior to this, for the First and Second Maturity are only phases in completing the building and not ascents as such.
<b>As long as it is in the process of receiving its due…</b> From the very outset the lights of the Partzuf are given all the powers necessary for its functioning – although during Pregnancy and Immaturity they are closed up. They steadily expand little by little until they grow to the full extent ordained for them: this is called growth (הגדלה, <i>hagdalah</i>). Here below man grows in exactly the same way. The growing child contains everything found in the mature adult except that it is closed up and exists only in miniature. Afterwards he steadily expands until he reaches full size, by which time he has already brought forth and revealed everything inherent in his nature from the outset. All growth follows the same pattern.
<b>…this is called growth towards completion.</b> For when the Partzuf attains the ability to function and carry out its ordained purpose, it is said to be complete. Prior to this it was deficient, which is why it is called complete when it reaches this point.
<b>What is above this is an ascent.</b> An ascent means that one ascends above one’s intrinsic level.
<b>There are various arrangements like these…</b> For everything occurs in stages, and every level has its own unique arrangements.
<b>…for this is the source of the addition that comes at different times on weekdays, Shabbat and the other holidays.</b> All the different states of the Partzufim generate consequences below. The effects of a given state are felt at the time when it holds sway – the holiness of Shabbat and festivals are felt on those particular days – and they also contribute to the overall government of the world. Thus, besides their rule on those particular days, the holiness of Shabbat and the festivals contribute to perfecting the overall governmental order.<sup class="footnote-marker"><b><small>*</small></b></sup><i class="footnote">For example, “We sound the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah to strengthen the repair that took place with the Giving of the Torah and initiate what will be in the future.” (<i>Maamar HaChochmah, Malchuyot Zichronot VeShofarot</i>). “It is like chopping away at a tree, striking blow after blow until one chops it down completely.” (Ibid. <i>Seder Leil Pesach</i>).</i> Everything is designed to ensure that the cycle will be complete and suffice for all that is destined to happen in the world until everything returns to complete perfection at the final end in the future.

Chapter 133

<i>Zeir Anpin’s ascent – after the Second Maturity</i>
<b>What Zeir Anpin receives even in the Second Maturity is not called an ascent for him. Only when he rises further afterwards is it called an ascent.</b>
<i>Having discussed the concept of ascents, we will now explain the significance of the Second Maturity, which is not an ascent.</i>
<b>What Zeir Anpin receives…</b> Zeir Anpin receives his Mental Powers from Abba and Imma, and until he has received them it is not called an ascent. On the contrary, it is Abba and Imma who come down to Zeir Anpin, lowering their Netzach-Hod-Yesod to his level, and crowning and adorning him.
<b>…even in the Second Maturity…</b> As explained earlier, Second Maturity is only the conferral of mental powers, although now they are given by Abba and Imma and not merely by Israel Sabba-Tevunah.
<b>…is not called an ascent for him. Only when he rises further…</b> For then he no longer depends on Abba and Imma <i>giving</i> him, because they have already given him what he needs, and now it is Zeir Anpin that ascends. Thus:
<b>…afterwards is it called an ascent.</b> All that comes after the Second Maturity is considered an ascent.<br> <b>•</b> “Understand this through the ascents of Shabbat: on Shabbat night Zeir Anpin receives the encompassing levels in his interior, and then attains the Second Maturity… But only in the morning is the Second Maturity altogether complete, after which he literally ascends to Netzach-Hod-Yesod of Imma during the Morning Prayer” (<i>Pitchey Chochmah VaDaat</i> ch. 56).

Chapter 134

<big><strong>The Repair of Nukva (Openings 134-138)</strong></big>
<i>Zeir Anpin repairs Nukva to create the possibility of service by the lower creations.</i>
<b>Nukva must be repaired by Zeir Anpin in the ways needed in order for her to provide a place for the service of the lower creations, whether by receiving from his back parts or receiving from his front, be it from the chest and below or the chest and above. These are all different states in which she may ascend or descend, depending on the deeds of the lower creations.</b>
<i>Having discussed how the different ascents and descents increase or decrease the strength of the government, we will now examine the repairs that enable Nukva to be affected by men’s deeds and to increase or decrease the flow of influence accordingly.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: Nukva must be repaired…</b> This explains the repairs to the Nukva in general terms. <b>Part 2: …whether by receiving…</b> This lists the specific arrangements.
<b>Part 1: Nukva must be repaired by Zeir Anpin…</b> Man’s entire service is bound up with repairing the Nukva, which is the very root of the lower creations. The purpose of all man’s service is to repair the Nukva in such a way as to enable blessing to come to her and through her to the lower creations in great abundance.
But everything is done in stages, and the repairs to Nukva preparing her to receive the flow of influence in the proper way also follow the principle of measure and gradation. The degree to which Nukva is repaired through men’s deeds and thereby prepared for Zeir Anpin determines the degree to which all the different lights she receives from Zeir Anpin for the lower realm will radiate. Everything is governed by the principle that “all depends on the abundance of good deeds” (<i>Avot</i> 3:19).
Nukva is built with certain specific attributes and arrangements that constitute the laws required to create the possibility of a suitable level and measure of service on the part of the lower creations. The entire repair and building of Nukva come about through Zeir Anpin. We therefore say that Nukva needs different repairs from Zeir Anpin in order to produce arrangements that will provide a place for man’s service and bring it into being in all its details. <b>…in the ways needed in order for her to provide a place for the service of the lower creations.</b><br> (Thus Zeir Anpin prepares the Nukva with various inbuilt ways of receiving from him – Back-to-Back or Face-to-Face etc. – subject to men’s deeds. Two kinds of repairs to Nukva are mentioned here: 1. Repairs to her structure by Zeir Anpin preparing her to receive the service of the lower creations. 2. Repairs that come from Zeir Anpin as a result of and in the merit of this service.)
<b>Part 2: …whether by receiving from his back parts or receiving from his front… </b>These are all the different states of Nukva. She may be either Back-to-Back or Face-to-Face, and this in one of two ways: <b>…be it from the chest and below or the chest and above.</b> All these are different ways already prepared by Zeir Anpin whereby Nukva ascends or descends depending on the deeds of the lower creations, as the proposition goes on to say.
<b>These are all different states in which she may ascend or descend, depending on the deeds of the lower creations.</b> Everything has its own defined order. Despite the vast multitude of deeds, all come under a finite number of categories which the Supreme Thought prepared in advance to suffice for everything that is destined to come about. (These three states are the general categories that include all possible relationships between Zeir Anpin and Nukva as determined by men’s deeds.)

Chapter 135

<i>Back-to-Back – and the Separation to come Face-to-Face</i>
<b>The state of Back-to-Back is one of excitation of Strengths that flash forth and attach themselves to one another while the Faces have no function or power and do not turn to shine to one another. And then the influence that needs to descend even at that time gains sway – but it gains sway in that mode of flashing excitation. This requires the Separation in order to leave all the Strengths to Nukva and to complete the Male on all his levels so as to sweeten and repair her.</b>
<i>We will now complete our discussion of Nukva’s different states in relation to Zeir Anpin.</i>
The proposition consists of two parts: <b>Part 1: The state of Back-to-Back…</b> This explains the concept of Back-to-Back. <b>Part 2: This requires…</b> This is the repair that brings them Face-to-Face.
<b>Part 1: The state of Back-to-Back is one of excitation of Strengths…</b> The concepts of the Face and Back were discussed earlier (see Opening 76). The Face consists of those lights that shine to their receivers, while the Back consists of lights that do not shine to those looking there. Every level includes both aspects. All that shines comes from the category of Kindnesses, while that which does not shine comes from the category of Strengths. When we say Back-to-Back it means that the aspects of Zeir Anpin and Nukva that do not shine are both aroused at once.
<b>…that flash forth and attach themselves to one another…</b> When one aspect or function becomes linked with another, the lights are said to be attached to one another. The government is then the product of this concentration of Judgments and as a result is one of Harsh Judgment.
<b>…while the Faces have no function or power…</b> In the state of Back-to-Back the lights of the Face do not hold sway. Instead of the lights cooperating with one another to radiate in a revealed manner and generate repair, in the state of Back-to-Back two different kinds of Judgments are aroused – Judgments of the Male and Judgments of the Female – but not in a constructive, orderly manner.
<b>…and do not turn to shine to one another.</b> In terms of the archetypal man, the state of Back-to-Back was when Adam and Eve were attached together in this way and did not see one another. Similarly on the level of the Partzufim, in the state of Back-to-Back the lights do not turn to one another in sequence in order to receive what they need for their completion. Instead they all flash at once with no coordination whatever (like two people talking at once).
The intention of the rectified order was first to reveal the different levels of government stage by stage, showing all their various aspects and how they develop separately – Kindness by itself and Judgment by itself – and afterwards to reveal the balance of right and left. For balance is only possible when there are two different sides – the right, Kindness, and the left, Judgment. However in this Back-to-Back state of excitation, everything flashes at once – making it impossible for the government to be revealed in a graded, orderly way. Zeir Anpin and Nukva both operate with Judgment, and there is no balance or coupling.
<b>And then the influence that needs to descend even at that time gains sway…</b> Influence needs to come down all the time, but in order to be properly attuned it must descend in an orderly way – as explained – from the male to the female. The influence must be channeled through the successive revelation of all the powers as linked together in the chain of development from the head all the way to the end of the Male and from there to the Female. When the two operative Partzufim are joined with one another in a state of repair – i.e. Face-to-Face – the lights join together and interact so as to be revealed in coordination.
However in the state of Back-to-Back they are like two flames flashing at once but each closed up in itself so that neither reveals its lights. Influence must come down, because without it the world could not survive at that time. But the influence is incomplete and is not properly attuned. The excitation causes a surge of influence, but the influence is one of Judgment, which sustains the creations in a limited way with no radiation of the Face whatever, as the proposition continues:
<b>…but it gains sway in that mode of flashing excitation.</b> In other words, not with a full radiation.
<b>Part 2: This requires the Separation…</b> Initially the government is such that the full force of Judgment flashes forth but with no preparation of the powers required to enable the operative Partzufim to modulate and channel the influence in an orderly way (i.e. in stages culminating in Coupling).
Afterwards Abba and Imma must complete the repair of this root – i.e. the Back-to-Back state of Zeir and Nukva. Their repair follows a specific order corresponding to Zeir and Nukva’s functions in the government on the sides of Kindness and Judgment respectively. All the powers are then properly divided with the Kindness on one side – Zeir Anpin – and the Judgment on the other side – Nukva. This leads to an orderly government in which Kindness has its full effect and Strength has its full effect. And afterwards they join together to operate in consensus in the proper way.
<b>…in order to leave all the Strengths to Nukva…</b> Zeir Anpin gives Nukva his original back parts, which thus remain as levels of Nukva, whose government is based on Judgment. Instead of them, other new aspects are found in Zeir Anpin stemming from Kindness, and even his back parts – which Zeir Anpin receives anew from Abba – are in the category of Kindness.
Zeir Anpin and Nukva were initially joined together because in truth all these aspects belong to Nukva, which is made up of Strengths, except that before the Separation Zeir Anpin was also using some of them to serve as his back parts because his own powers of Kindness were not yet sufficiently repaired to be able to rule and function. This is the secret of the verse: “You forgot (תשי, <i>TeShi</i>) the Rock that gave birth to you” (Deuteronomy 32:18) – “His power weakened (תשש, <i>TaShaSh</i>) like a female” (<i>Berachot</i> 32a; cf. Rashi on Numbers 11:15).
The essential underlying foundation of all this is that even Zeir Anpin is rooted in Imma, as discussed in connection with the Primordial Kings (see Opening 52). Imma’s strengths – which are female aspects – are the root of the Primordial Kings, from which Zeir Anpin is built. This is the secret of the verse: “Everything was from the dust” (Ecclesiastes 3:20). The reason men’s sins cause such great damage is that they bring things back to this root of Back-to-Back. Zeir Anpin and Nukva then both remain rooted in this female aspect. This is why the Rabbis pointedly said, “His power weakened like a <i>female</i>”.
Afterwards Zeir Anpin’s own intrinsic aspects become truly revealed, and he then leaves all the female aspects to Nukva, giving her his back parts, while asserting himself in his own male aspects of Kindness – so that even his back parts are then in the category of Kindness. These Kindnesses come to him through MaH from Abba – from all the places on the right, which is the Male aspect. Zeir Anpin then truly has the power to govern and couple in the proper way, as the proposition goes on to say.
<b>…and to complete the Male on all his levels…</b> Zeir Anpin must take his male aspects so that he and Nukva can come back Face-to-Face with one another so as to be mutually repaired with all their powers fully revealed with abundant light. This is the mystery of the Radiation of the Face (הארת פנים, <i>he’arat panim</i>). Zeir Anpin then acts to sweeten the Nukva, as the proposition continues: <b>…so as to sweeten and repair her.</b>
The sum of the matter is that Zeir and Nukva derive from Imma’s Strengths, which are female. Initially Zeir Anpin’s power is therefore not like that of a male but weakened like that of a female. Coupling – which channels the light through the entire chain of development – would then be highly dangerous, because excess influence improperly channeled gives nourishment to the unholy forces.<br> Accordingly Zeir and Nukva look each other in the face so as to reveal their powers in the full sequence of cause and effect only when the influence flows after all due preparation and with goodwill. Instead all that is seen are the female aspects, which the Male and Female use together in one surge of excitation – yet both of them are still fully closed up. Until Abba and Imma come and repair Zeir Anpin, distributing the powers in the proper way with Kindness alone on one side and Strength alone on the other. All the female aspects are now left exclusively to Nukva while all the male aspects are renewed in Zeir Anpin. He then receives the power to sweeten and repair the Nukva as well by Coupling, as will be discussed presently.

Chapter 136

<i>When Zeir Anpin and Nukva are complete they are ready for Interior and Exterior coupling.</i>
<b>The mystery of Coupling depends on the reign of unity so that the vessels of Zeir Anpin and the Nukva actually become attached in such a way as to be considered literally one – just like the interior, which is already one. This is the meaning of the verse, “And they shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24). It begins with Kissing, which is the joining together of the Ruach – i.e. the interior, which becomes so powerfully unified that it even causes the exteriors to become attached to one another. However this comes about only when both Zeir Anpin and Nukva are complete. Zeir Anpin must be complete with all his Mental Powers and all the higher Partzufim bound to him to adorn him. Nukva must be complete with all the repairs she receives through the lower creations, which are bound up with her. The completeness of the preparations determines the completeness of the Coupling, which may be through the mystery of Israel and Rachel or through their other branches, male and female.</b>
<i>Having explained the repairs necessary in order to reach the stage of Coupling, let us now examine the concept of Coupling itself.</i>
This proposition consists of two parts. <b>Part 1: The mystery of Coupling…</b> This explains the concept of Coupling. <b>Part 2: However this comes about…</b> This explains the preparations required in order to reach this stage.
<b>Part 1: The mystery of Coupling depends on the reign of unity…</b> Coupling is alluded to in the verse: “And he placed his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes…” (Kings II, 4:34). Coupling is the complete joining of all the limbs of Zeir Anpin with all the limbs of Nukva. This in truth is the secret of the Supreme Unity, which brings Kindness and Judgment back to one root through the mystery of “HaShem, He is God” (Kings I, 18:39). It is through this repair that the different influences go forth.
<b>…so that the vessels of Zeir Anpin and the Nukva actually become attached…</b> This is the mystery of the repair of the Residue as discussed earlier (Opening 30, end). The Line must rule over the Residue and the Line itself must repair it by removing the evil from it and returning it to the underlying unity.
<b>…in such a way as to be considered literally one – just like the interior, which is already one.</b> For it is evil that separates the receiver of influence from the giver, as discussed earlier in connection with the different degrees of closeness of the Male and Female aspects on different levels (see Opening 73). This separation is what has to be rectified.
<b>This is the meaning of the verse, “And they shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24).</b> The ultimate goal of Coupling is that the flesh, which is the exterior, should become one. The Ruach, the interior, actually <i>is</i> one – because the Ruach is rooted in unity – but the flesh does not actually become literally one. Nevertheless, under the influence of the Mental Powers, the “flesh” of the two Partzufim joins to the greatest possible degree – but only so as to be <i>considered</i> one flesh.
<b>It begins with Kissing…</b> For the Kisses come first and afterwards the Coupling of the Yesods.
<b>…which is the joining together of the Ruach – i.e. the interior…</b> On the level of the Ruach the connection is a double one: the Ruach of the Male is in the Nukva and that of the Nukva is in the Male (see <i>Pitchey Chochmah VaDaat</i> ch. 95, <i>Klalut HaIlan</i> 6:6). This is because the purpose of the Coupling of Kisses is to arouse the power of the Supreme Unity so as to forge an actual connection. This is not so in the case of the Coupling of the Yesods, whose purpose is only to send influence. Before the influence flows, they must be attached to one another with proximity of the flesh. However influence is sent only from the Male to the Female (unlike in the Coupling of Kisses, where the giving is mutual and each becomes included in the other).
<b>…which becomes so powerfully unified that it even causes the exteriors to become attached to one another.</b> It is the joining of the Ruachs that causes the exteriors to become attached as well.
<b>Part 2: However this comes about only when both Zeir Anpin and Nukva are complete.</b> The concealment of the unity shows the deficiencies that exist without it, while the revelation of the unity is the repair of the deficiencies. Before it is possible to reach the ultimate revelation of the unity, all the previous deficiencies must be repaired. This can be accomplished either through the efforts of the lower creations or – if they fail – through the hand of the Supreme Will. In either case, first the more serious of the remaining deficiencies will be repaired through Maturity and Mental Powers until little by little things will reach this ultimate perfection. It is the removal of all the deficiencies that facilitates Coupling, which is the revelation of the unity.
<b>Zeir Anpin must be complete with all his Mental Powers…</b> The repairs must suit the deficiencies they come to rectify, while the deficiencies in any given light correspond to its unique functions. Since Zeir Anpin is the ruler and giver of influence, it is precisely the power of government and influence – the Mental Powers – that must be complete in him.
<b>…and all the higher Partzufim bound to him to adorn him.</b> In essence the service of the lower creations reaches only to Zeir Anpin, but its effects reach even to the Partzufim above him – Abba and Imma and Arich Anpin. This is because they repair and adorn Zeir Anpin with Mental Powers in order to perfect his function of sending influence. This they can only do to the extent that the lower creations are fit to receive the influence.
<b>Nukva must be complete with all the repairs she receives through the lower creations, which are bound up with her.</b> Since Nukva is the root of the receiver, it is necessary that all the lower creations – the receivers – be included within her since they are her branches, and this is her repair. This repair must be present in Nukva in all its detailed aspects.
<b>The completeness of the preparations determines the completeness of the Coupling…</b> The level of preparedness of both the sources and receivers of influence differs at different times. (Certain times are conducive to higher levels of preparation for Coupling, such as when the Temple is standing.) The lower creations are not always bound together in the same way, and Zeir Anpin’s Mental Powers are not always renewed with the same strength. But when the conditions for Coupling are ripe – when all the lower creations are contained in Nukva – there will be Coupling on a level matching that of the preparations.
<b>…which may be through the mystery of Israel and Rachel…</b> These are the essential Male and Female, while the others (such as Jacob and Leah) serve only to complete them, and the other Couplings are certainly on a lower level.
<b>…or through their other branches, male and female.</b> This is the mystery of Jacob and Leah, which are branches of the essential Male and Female.

Chapter 137

<i>The Shechinah is complete when all the lower creations – the angels and the souls – are contained within her.</i>
<b>It is from the Shechinah that all the lower worlds extend with all the different aspects of service they contain – that of the angels and that of the souls. The function of the angels is to execute the commands of the Shechinah while the souls are to serve the Holy One, blessed be He, through their free will. She is therefore said to be incomplete and unable to couple except when all these different branches of hers are contained within her in accordance with their respective functions. And then through their combined power Coupling takes place with all the worlds repaired.</b>
<i>Having explained that the Shechinah must be repaired with her branches, let us now discuss this repair in greater detail.</i>
The proposition has two parts. <b>Part 1: It is from the Shechinah…</b> This explains the branches that extend from the Shechinah. <b>Part 2: She is therefore…</b> The completeness of the Shechinah depends on these branches.
<b>Part 1: It is from the Shechinah that all the lower worlds extend…</b> The Shechinah – Nukva of Atzilut – is the root of all the lower creations, these being the receivers.
<b>…with all the different aspects of service they contain…</b> The Shechinah is not only the root of the lower creations themselves but of all their different aspects – including especially the task entrusted to them. For since the repair is in their hands, they have to carry out their function – which as part of their essential nature must also be rooted in the Shechinah.
<b>…that of the angels and that of the souls.</b> These are two kinds of branches, each with its own exclusive task.
<b>The function of the angels is to execute the commands of the Shechinah…</b> The angels merely execute the actions of the Sefirot – because the Supreme Thought also wanted this gradation whereby the actions of the Sefirot and the creations subject to them should not issue directly from the Shechinah but through these agents that she has. Theirs is not the service of free will but literal servitude.
<b>…while the souls are to serve the Holy One, blessed be He, through their free will.</b> It is self-evident that men’s service is the service of free will – to repair all that exists.
<b>Part 2: She is therefore said to be incomplete and unable to couple except when all these different branches of hers are contained in her in accordance with their respective functions.</b> The two kinds of branches become contained in the Shechinah in different ways specific to each, depending on their functions, the nature of their tasks and the effects of their execution of those tasks, as will be explained in the following Opening. (The angels become contained in the Shechinah through the ascent of the Chambers – the <i>Heichalot</i> – and the souls through sending up the Female Waters.)
<b>And then through their combined power Coupling takes place with all the worlds repaired.</b> For when all this is complete, all the upper and lower worlds are joined together in one repair. All the upper realms are contained in Zeir Anpin in <i>sending</i> influence, while Nukva contains all the lower realms to <i>receive</i>. When they join together through their Coupling, all that exists – the higher realms and the lower realms – join together in one interconnected whole, and the unity asserts itself and rules as befitting.
At present every Coupling is in truth a revelation of the Supreme Unity, but not a whole and complete revelation. However, after all the Couplings required in the course of the entire six thousand years, God’s Supreme Unity will be properly revealed over all that exists in all their parts and this will be the complete repair for ever to eternity.

Chapter 138

<i>The order of Coupling through the Male and Female Waters</i>
<b>According to the order of Coupling, Nukva – the Shechinah – must encompass all the lower worlds. These must be properly repaired in all the necessary ways – through the removal of the Other Side and the repair of the worlds by each other through all their good arrangements. Nukva is then ready for Zeir Anpin, and he joins with her. He then gives her a certain power known as “the Spirit that her husband sends into her”. Through this power she sends up Female Waters – this being what she channels – whether in the form of a revelation of new light or through the restoration of what was concealed or damaged. She sends up her Female Waters through the power of the souls of the Tzaddikim. Zeir Anpin then increases what he gives her – in proportion to what she sends up – in the form of new influence, this being the Male Waters. This afterwards descends into the world, spreading to the ministering attendants and from there down to the world of Asiyah, from where it goes forth to act.</b>
<i>Since Coupling is the goal of all service, we will conclude this entire discussion with an explanation of the order of Coupling.</i>
<b>According to the order of Coupling…</b> The entire order starts with the very first preparation for Coupling and continues until the whole act is complete.
<b>…Nukva – the Shechinah – must encompass all the lower worlds.</b> You have already heard that Nukva is the root of all the lower creations and is therefore incomplete without them. Accordingly Nukva must first contain within her all these lower creations – in the sense that they must be bound to her in all the ways prepared and ready to bring about these interconnections. The way in which the worlds become bound to and contained in the Shechinah is through the Chambers (היכלות, <i>heichalot</i>), which ascend and become bound with each other until everything is contained in the Chamber of Holy of Holies of Beriyah. There they are all bound with the Shechinah like branches merged in their source.
<b>These must be properly repaired in all the necessary ways…</b> These include all the repairs required in the branches to enable them to become attached to their root. Two things are necessary in order to repair the branches.
<b>…through the removal of the Other Side…</b> This is the first repair. The second is: <b>…and the repair of the worlds by each other through all their good arrangements.</b> They must be repaired by each other through their <i>good</i> arrangements because these worlds of Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah contain actual good and evil since they contain separate creations. This is not so in the case of Atzilut, where all is Godliness and evil is irrelevant. It is the evil in these lower worlds that separates the branches from their root, because evil truly has the power to cause this separation, and this is what must therefore be removed. The higher levels of Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah must then be merged and included in one another through all the arrangements that exist for this purpose in the lights of the Chariot.
When the Shechinah is repaired in all these ways, the Receiver is said to be ready to receive. The repair of the worlds through being included in one another comes about through their respective angels: these are the Chariots on which the lights ride.
<b>Nukva is then ready for Zeir Anpin…</b> Thus it says, “Your desire shall be for your husband” (Genesis 3:16). When Nukva is ready for Zeir Anpin, she arouses joy and favor in the Supreme Lights, eliciting a full, open revelation of their powers rather than one that is occluded – because the Giver <i>wants</i> to send a flow of influence, waiting only for her arousal.
<b>…and he joins with her.</b> They become one. Through the Kisses they literally become one on the level of the Ruach, because in the interior the join is complete. And the exterior vessels join together with the greatest degree of connection possible.
<b>He then gives her a certain power known as “the Spirit that her husband sends into her”.</b> Now the influence begins to flow – because first the lights must be repaired in order to be able to carry out their functions, and only afterwards do they actually execute them. The function of the lights is to send an ever-renewed flow of influence. For they are always the same lights: it is the influence they channel that is renewed. However, in order to draw forth this influence Nukva requires an additional repair – the arousal of the souls, as the proposition goes on to state. But this repair requires a prior preparation to enable the souls to act. A certain power – the “Spirit that her husband sends into her” – is put into the Shechinah herself so as to be able to gather the souls to her in order to accomplish this. This is called making a vessel.
<b>Through this power she sends up Female Waters…</b> This is a particular power that enables the Shechinah to carry out this function of sending up the Female Waters.
<b>…this being what she channels…</b> This is the flow that the Shechinah for her part draws from the Emanator to send into the world. Its root is most exalted – for it lies in the Residue. The material substance of the separate creations derives from the Strengths in Yesod of Nukva – the root of Judgment revealed in the Residue. For as you have already heard, the Place that remained after the Tzimtzum is Malchut. The Judgment revealed therein is the Strengths in Yesod of Nukva, and this is the root of the material substance of the creations – “Everything was from the dust” (Ecclesiastes 3:20). The Line on the other hand is the Male Waters.
In allusion to this the sages said: “[The congealment of the firmament] can be compared to a pot of milk (=the material substance, Judgment): as soon as a drop of rennet falls into it, it immediately solidifies” (<i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 4:7). In terms of this metaphor, the resulting entity essentially derives from the milk – because the rennet is merely the catalyst. Similarly, the root of the material substance of the separate creations lies in the Strengths.
Judgment has its own functions in the government of the creations. However we are not now talking about the governmental functioning of Judgment but rather about what is born as the direct offspring of the lights of Judgment, which then function as they function in the governmental order. The offspring of the lights is the material substance of the separate creations. The subsequent <i>government</i> of these creations through Judgment is a separate matter. What we are saying is that out of Judgment come forth fire and gold etc. i.e. from the actual lights themselves, not through their <i>functioning</i> in the governmental order. Likewise, water or silver etc. come forth from Kindness – from the actual lights themselves. The functioning of the lights is a different matter: this is the “rennet” that activates the material, while the material itself comes from the lights themselves, and this is the “milk”.
The separate creations as independent beings are indeed built of two parts – MaH and BaN – for although they are the offspring of Judgment=BaN, they also include parts of MaH. BaN includes everything relating to the material substance given to the separate creations at the outset together with all that depends on it, while MaH includes everything relating to the Line – the part of the substance that repairs, together with all that depends on it. However in the actual body of each separate being the parts of MaH and BaN respectively are equal: half relate to MaH and half to BaN. The part that rectifies – MaH, the Line – is equal to the part of the material that it has to repair. Accordingly we say that all the Partzufim are compounded of parts of MaH and BaN.
Accordingly, the whole function of the Nukva is Strengths – renewal of the half of all entities that comes from BaN, i.e. the renewal of their material substance. MaH performs a different and very essential function: the renewal of the material substance of all that exists <i>through interior spirituality</i>. This material substance deriving from BaN is a dark material but it causes one of two things: either joy or sorrow – through repair or destruction. This material substance stands to be repaired with the most exalted of repairs and radiations by MaH, and if it is repaired it generates every kind of joy and love. But if not, God forbid, it causes every kind of sorrow and destruction (see Opening 92).
To return to our theme: Nukva needs the Five Strengths in her Yesod, these being the roots of the material substance of all the existing entities, as we have explained. When the material is renewed and duly repaired to enable Nukva to arouse this root in the proper way, the Receiver stands asking for Kindness from the Giver of Influence – and then the Male Waters will descend. However, in order to be able to arouse him, Nukva needs a power from the male that completes her, making her a receiving vessel. This power is the Spirit mentioned above. Everything is in the category of Strengths, for this Spirit is from the side of Strengths, because this whole function of sending the Female Waters is rooted in Judgment.
In short, Nukva generates renewal only in the half of every existing entity that derives from BaN – but this very renewal is the arousal of all the receivers to their Giver of influence. For it is to show that the arousal of the receivers comes from the side of BaN that BaN is put in every existing entity – for “the Spirit that her husband sends into her” is also in the category of BaN. The function is specific – through BaN – yet it affects the whole, including the parts that derive from MaH. This is how she channels new influence to sustain the half of each existing entity that comes from BaN. Things are renewed in the overall government of all the worlds in accordance with the renewal of these parts.
<b>…whether in the form of a revelation of new light or through the restoration of what was concealed or damaged.</b> If things were in a state of repair, there would be continual Coupling, which would elevate the entire creation level after level through renewal (as was the intention had Adam not sinned). With each act of coupling Nukva would then immediately draw forth a certain light that would renew the half of the existing entities that derives from BaN, as discussed above, elevating it one additional level through that act of Coupling. However because things are damaged (as a result of the sin of Adam and other sins thereafter) many attributes that the worlds previously possessed have been lost. These now have to be restored. Thus the purpose of the Couplings that take place now is merely to restore the levels lost through sin. Only afterwards will it be possible to rise to the heights that would have been attained had it not been for these sins.
All these exalted attributes derive from lights emanating from the Shechinah, these being the roots of what exists in Beriyah-Yetzirah-Asiyah. There are things that should have been in those lower worlds and which had their root in the Strengths in Yesod of the Shechinah, which are the roots of the lower creations. However, when these exalted levels left the worlds, those roots either became concealed or were damaged through descending into the husks, with the result that the husks benefited instead of the world and Israel. It is these levels that must be restored. Every day some of these lights are once again revealed in order to repair the world.
<b>She sends up her Female Waters through the power of the souls of the Tzaddikim.</b> This is a repair that depends on the souls since the interior government is bound up essentially with them. In other words, it is the ascent of the souls to become bound above in her Yesod and radiate there that elicits this flow of Female Waters.
<b>Zeir Anpin then increases what he gives her…</b> Zeir Anpin for his part increases what <i>he</i> has to channel – the flow of the influence of MaH to the other half of all the existing entities, which still needs to be completed, with all that depends on it in the overall government. MaH thus brings not only the existing entities but also the entire governmental order to perfection.
<b>…in proportion to what she sends up – in the form of new influence, this being the Male Waters.</b> The light revealed through the Strengths – the Female Waters of Nukva – determines the light that descends to complete it from the Kindnesses of Zeir Anpin.
<b>This afterwards descends into the world…</b> These two kinds of flows – the Female Waters and the Male Waters – are themselves the influence that descends into the world. This is the order in which it descends into the world to spread to the ministering attendants (משרתים, <i>meshar’tim</i>), as the proposition goes on to explain.
<b>…spreading to the ministering attendants…</b> This also follows a unique order that exists in the world of Beriyah – the place where the Glory stands in its Chamber to ride upon the ministering attendants. For the Chambers are here in Beriyah and the Shechinah dwells at the head of Beriyah in the Chamber of the Holy of Holies. It is there that all the branches – the creations – are attached to her. This is the secret of all that is discussed in connection with the Chambers and the Chariot in <i>Brit Menuchah</i> (an ancient, fundamental Kabbalistic text endorsed by the ARI).
<b>…and from there down to the world of Asiyah…</b> Gradations exist among the ministering attendants as required by the governmental order. And the descending influence thus comes down level by level all the way to the bottom of the World of Asiyah.
<b>…from where it goes forth to act.</b> The end goal of the entire flow is to act in Asiyah, whether in the bodies or in the government. All that comes forth from that influence to act below, whether in the bodies, as explained earlier – i.e. some body is thereby renewed – or in the government – in the form of some new act of government, is according to the nature of that influence – depending on its source, all it undergoes, and all the conditions to which it is subject.
