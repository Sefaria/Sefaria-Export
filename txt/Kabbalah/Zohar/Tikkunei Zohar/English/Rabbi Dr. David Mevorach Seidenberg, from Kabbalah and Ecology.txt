... For the bird of the skies will lead/bring the voice, and the masters of wings will tell a word” [Ec 10:20]. Here this [word] is YHVH, the central pillar ...
... Y’ י is the head of the bird. V’ ו is his body. H”H ה ה are the two wings, through which he flies upward and comes to rest below. And these two wings are two breaths, H”H, and concerning them it is said, “And the animals/chayot [bearing the divine chariot] ran and returned” [Ez 1:14], for these are Y”V: a breath leaves through Y’ י – a breath returns through V’

“Let us make a human”—this is the command to circumcise the convert to become “in our image” through the cutting of the foreskin, “as our likeness” through tearing back [the foreskin], and if they freed the sign of the covenant through these two [actions] then he is “in our image as our likeness”, and if not, not.

‘Let us make Adam/ a human’—to whom did the Cause of causes say this to? The Cause of causes said [it] to none other than YudHe’ Va’v He’, which is [drawn] from out of ten Sefirot.”
... The ten s’firot . . . are clothed in ten things that were created on the first day, and these are: heavens and earth, light and darkness, abyss and chaos, wind and water, the measure of day and the measure of night.

“This/Zeh is the book of the generations of Adam”. “ZH” (7 + 5) literally/vad’ay, comprising the twelve constellations of Adam that is above / Adam dil`eyla, about which it says concerning them, “tribes of Yah, testimonies of Israel” [Ps 122:4]. “Zeh” literally are the four faces of the lion, four faces of the ox, four faces of the eagle, that in them are recognized the faces/par’tsufin of human beings. And all of these faces are impressed in the four letters of YHV”H ... This is the Shekhinah that is called “the human likeness / d’mut Adam” [Ez 1:5], for every likeness/dimyon and face/par’tsuf of human beings are recognized in her, and every form above and below; and because of her it is said, “and through the hand of (by) the prophets I will be imaged /adameh” [Ho 12:11].

And the hands of the matronita, are all of Her holy. All of them are tracings in (of) the name YHVH, like this: in the palm Y י, in the five fingers H ה, in Her arm V ו and in Her shoulder H ה. In Her palm are formed so many lines, like branches of the Tree of Life . . . That is what’s written: “A tree of life she is for the ones holding her (i.e. the arms) and her supporters are happy” [Pr 3:18].
V is the written Torah, which is given in two arms . . . and with them the two tablets are given, which are “two breasts” [So 4:5]. And these are YY יי, (i.e., two dots, perhaps the areolae or nipples), and in (i.e., between) them is the form of a Zayin, and in (between) them it is narrow/tsar. That is why it’s written: “And [God] formed/Vayyitsar/ VYYTsR [the human]” [Gn 2:7], and they are the virginity-signs/b’tulim of the maiden [which signify] the Torah by mouth (oral Torah).
The praise of the body / sh’vacha d’gufa: “This qomah of yours is likened to a date palm / zo’t qomateikh damtah l’tamar” [So 7:8]. And one that knows the measure of Her stature/body / shi`ur qomah dilah (symbolized by the upright palm) will inherit the world that is coming. . . about which it says: “Israel’s purifying pool / miqveh Yisra’el is YHVH” [Je 17:13]—miqveh/MQVH מקוה , which is Her body/qomah/QVMH קומה , Her shi`ur. Sh`iur qomah – this is the Righteous One /Tsadiq, about whom it says: “Tsadiq like a date palm will bloom” [Ps 92:13]
For it says about her/Her: “And they came Elim-ward, and there [were] twelve springs of water and seventy date palms” [Ex 15:27]. “Twelve springs”—these are twelve joints/sections, which are: six in the arms (right and left shoulder, elbow, and wrist, or upper arm, lower arm, and hand) and six in two legs/shoqin (right and left hip, knee, and ankle, etc.). That is what’s written: “His hands [are] rolls of gold filled in Tarshish (or: with beryl)” [So 5:14]. What is “in Tarshish ( תרשיש )”? “In two, six / t’rey shesh ( תרי שש )”—in two arms [are] six joints; and so [are there] six/shesh others in two legs, [as it says:] “His [two] thighs are pillars of marble/shesh ( שש )” [So 5:15]. These are twelve springs.
