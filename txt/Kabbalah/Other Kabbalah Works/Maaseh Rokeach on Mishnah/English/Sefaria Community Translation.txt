Maasrot

Tractate Ma'asrot has 5 chapters. The first letters of each of those chapters has the numerical value of 40 and the numerical value of the last letters in each of those chapters is 496. All these details need to be explained.
It appears to me, once we know that the previous tractate [ed. see introduction to Tractate Terumot above] corresponds to the 12 tribes, and also since it is well known that in all the Midrashim the Tribe of Levi is called "maaser" from the tribes (being as Jacob swore an oath to "give maaser from all that [God] gives me", he therefore separated Levi as "maaser"). Based on this, I feel forced to ask a question: In the Talmud, Tractate Ketubot (50a) teaches that a person should not give more than a fifth of his wealth to charity and brings a proof from Jacob who said "Aser Eh'asreinu" which the Talmud interprets to mean a fifth [ed. as opposed to merely a tenth as the simple reading implies]. If this is so, how could Jacob have fulfilled his oath by only sanctifying Levi [ed. which would be one tenth of his sons] when he vowed to sanctify one fifth [ed. ie. two children out of ten]?

Another correct reason that the erasure of Amalek is 166 words in the Torah and that there are 166 verses in the Scroll of Esther can be said as follows: It is known that Esther is the secret of the Divine Presence, the trait of Kingship (<i>Malkhut</i>) in the secret of, "and Esther wore royal (<i>malkhut</i>) garments" (Esther 5:1). And this is the secret of (Chullin 139b:12), "From where in the Torah is Esther? 'And I will surely hide (<i>haster astir)' (Deuteronomy 31:17–18)." And the word, <i>astir, spelled full adds up to [a numerical equivalent] of 671, like the count of the name, <i>Ado-nai</i>, with its filling (each letter being spelled out), as is known (in the same way that 166 corresponded to an alternative count of the parallel name of God). And in my humble opinion, it appears that it is for this reason that there are ten sections in the Scroll, to complete the number of Esther, [to] Esther 10. For the Scroll is called the Scroll of Esther - and with the additional ten, it adds up to 671, to indicate her virtue, as she was with the secret of the higher Kingship, <i>Ado-nai</i>, with its filling</i></i>
