And the second aspect is that after the face (<i>partzuf</i>) itself of Rachel is rectified through the charity and gifts to the poor, there still needs to an enlightenment occurring within her, in the secret of its actual minds that are clothed within the face of her ten emanations at the time of slumber, as is known. So it is necessary for this enlightenment in her minds just mentioned to remain for all of these days called Purim, and to remain in existence there even if the minds of Father and Mother (<i>Abba veIma</i>) depart after the slumber and return to being face to face. But even with all of this, the enlightenment of those minds must remain in existence in her minds and not completely depart as at other times, as mentioned above. But this matter is dependent upon fulfillment of another commandment, and that is to have a Purim meal, a party and a joyous occasion.
