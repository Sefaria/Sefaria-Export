Morning Blessings

Morning Blessings
After washing hands, but before drying them, one says this blessing (and if someone was awake all night - they do not make this blessing, but only wash):
Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the raising of hands [i.e., washing]:
Every time a person goes to the bathroom, they should afterwards [wash hands] and say the Asher Yatzar blessing:
Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the Universe, Who formed man with wisdom and created many openings and cavities within him. It is obvious and known before Your throne of glory that if any one of them were closed or if one of any one them were opened, it would be impossible to exist for even an hour [i.e., a short while]. Blessed are You, Hashem, Who heals all flesh and does wondrous things. 
The Alo-hai Neshama blessing should immediately follow the Asher Yatzar blessing
My God, the soul that you placed within me is pure. You created it, You formed it, You breathed it into me, and You preserve it within me. And in the future, You will take it from me and restore it in the Time to Come. All the time that this soul is within me, I am thankful before You, Hashem, my God and the God of my fathers, Ruler of all creation, Lord of all the souls. Blessed are You, Hashem, Who restores souls to dead bodies. 
Blessed are You, Hashem, King of the Universe, Who gives the rooster [alt. heart] the understanding to distinguish between day and between night.

Blessed are You, Hashem, King of the Universe, Who removes the bonds of sleep from my eyes and the slumber from my eyelids. And may it be Your will, Hashem, my God and God of my fathers, that You accustom me in Your Torah and attach me to Your commandments. And do not bring me to sin, nor to iniquity, nor to be tested, nor to be disgraced. And distance me from the evil inclination and attach me to the good inclination.

The Midnight Rite

LeShem Yichud

Seder for Midnight Rectification
One does not say tikkun chatzot on the night of Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, Shmini Atzerat, and Hol Moed of Pesach. One does not say tikkun Rachel and says tikkun Leah on the days when no tachanun is said, on the days of the Omer, ten days of repentance, after the molad before Rosh Chodesh, even though vidui is said on that day, the house of mourning, the house of the bridegroom, the father of a son on his day, and the year of Shmitta in the land of Israel. Women do not say tikkun chatzot, nor is it said after Amud haShachar- neither tikkun Rachel nor tikkun Leah. During the 3 weeks, tikkun Rachel is said at the chatzot of the day (noon).For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, blessed be Him, and the Presence, in awe and compassion, compassion and awe, to unify the name of Yud-Kay with Vav-Kay, in complete unification for the sake of all of Israel. Here I am prepared to recite tikkun Rachel and tikkun Leah (on particular days they only say: tikkun Rachel or: tikkun Leah), which our Rabbis of blessed memory have arranged for us to rectify the roots (or: root) in the Highest Place, to give a spirit of pleasure to our Creator and do the will of our Maker. May the 
Please L·rd, Our G·d and G·d of Our Fathers – Let Our Prayer come before You &amp; do not conceal Yourself, Our King, from our supplications. For we are not brazen faced &amp; stiff necked to say before You, L·rd, our G-d &amp; G-d of our Fathers – we are righteous and we have not sinned. Rather we have sinned, we have been crooked and transgressed – we and our fathers and the people of our household. We were guilty. We Rebelled. We Stole. We spoke slander and evil speech. We caused iniquity, We caused evil. We did intentional bad. We did violence. We accused falsely and deceitfully. We provided bad advice. We spoke falsity. We became angry. We mocked. We rebelled. We rebelled against your word. We provoked. We committed adultery. We left the path. We transgressed deliberately. We damaged. We caused pain. We caused pain to our father and mother. We were stiff necked. We were evil. We destroyed. We did despicable things. We made people err. We left Your Commandments and Your good laws &amp; they were not worthy of us. And You are righteous on everything that happens to us – for You did truth and we acted wickedly.

Hanna's Prayer



Morning Prayer



Incense Offering

Incense Offering
You are the L·rd, Our G·d, that our Forefathers burned before You the incense spices at the time that the Holy Temple stood – like You commanded them through Moshe, Your Prophet, like it is written in your Torah.
And the L·rd said to Moshe – Take for yourself spices- balsam sap / Nataf / &amp; onycha / Sh-h'elet  &amp; galbanum / H'elbona, spices &amp; pure frankincense / Levona  – each shall be of equal weight. And you shall prepare it (the spices) as incense – a compound, the work of a spice mixer, blended (or salted) pure &amp; holy. And you shall grind from it very well, and you shall take from it, before the [tent of] testimony – in the Tent of Meeting  - that I shall meet with you there – holy, holy it shall be for you. And it says – and Aharon shall offer as incense, the incense spices each &amp; every morning when he cleans the lamps he shall offer it. And when Aharon Ascends, he shall offer the incense – a regular incense offering before the L·rd – throughout your generations.
Our Rabbis Taught, The compound of the Incense, how was it done? Three-hundred &amp; Sixty-eight Maneh (a measure) was in it – 365 [maneh] – like the count of the days of the solar year. One Maneh daily – half in the morning and half in the evening and the three extra maneh – where those of which the Chief Kohen entered [the holy of holies] and took from them a full palm-full on the Yom Kippur – he would return them to the grinder on the eve of Yom Kippur, in order to accomplish the mitzvah – in the finest of finest [way] and 11 spices were in it – and these are they:
1) Balsam, 2) onycha, 3) &amp; galbanum 4) frankincense – the weight of 70 maneh each. 5) myrrh, 6) cassia &amp; 7) spikenard &amp; 8) saffron – [each] a weight of 16, 16 maneh. 9) costus – 12 maneh 10) aromatic bark – three [maneh] 11) cinnamon – 9 (maneh) [Added also were] Lye of Carsina – 9 Kavs (a measure), Wine of Cypres – 3 Seahs and 3 kavs- and if one did not find wine of Cypres – he brings old wine. Salt of Sodom – a quarter [of a kav.] An ascension of smoke – a small amount. Rabbi Nathan, the Babylonian, says – even the resin of the Jordan – a bit. If he put in it honey it is invalid and if he omitted one from all of its spices, he is liable for death [penalty].
Rabban Shimeon Son of Gamliel says : The Tzorit is sap, that flows from the Balsam tree. The Lye of Karsina, what does it come [to do]? – in order to rub the onycha in order for it to be beautiful. The wine of Cyprus, why is it brought? in order to soak in it the Onycha, in order for it to be sharp. But is not urine – better [to make it sharp] – rather we do not bring in urine into the Sanctuary out of respect.
We learned in [a Baraita] Rabbi Nathan Says -  When he chops – he says “Hadek Heitev, Hetitev Hadek / Chop Well, Well Chop” because the voice is good for spices. The incense compound divided in half is Kosher. For a third or a-quarter we did not hear [the law]. Rabbi Yehuda said “This is the general rule – if it is in the same proportion – it is Kosher for half, &amp; if it lacks one from all of the spices – he is liable for the death penalty. 
Bar Kapara taught once every sixty or seventy years there were remains [of the spices] of half. And Bar Kapparah also taught , if one was to add a Kartov [a measure] of honey a person would not be able to stand because of the fragrance. And why do we not mix in it honey? Because the Torah says  “For any leaven or any honey, do not offer incense from it – as a fire offering. L·rd of hosts, is with us. He is our refuge for us the G·d of Yaakov / Jacob forever. L·rd of hosts, happy is the man that has faith in You. L·rd save, the King will answer us on the day we call. And pleasant to the L·rd is the offering of Yehudah / Judah and Yerusalayim / Jerusalem – like the days of old. 

Please [G·d] with the power of the greatness of Your right hand, free the captive [Israel from its Exile].
Accept the singing [prayer] of Your people. Strengthen us &amp; purify us, Awesome One. 
Please, Mighty One, those that seek Your unity - like the pupil of the eyes - guard them. 
Bless them &amp; purify them. The mercy of Your righteousness always bestow upon them. 
Mighty &amp; Holy One with the abundance of your good, lead Your congregation. 
Single Exalted One, turn to Your people - those that remind of Your Holiness . 
Accept our pleading &amp; hear our wailing - [You] Who knows the hidden. 
(And Say Silently) ...
Blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom forever more. 














Exalted &amp; sanctified be His (G·d's) great Name.  [cong. Amen.] In this world that He created according to His will. May His Kingdom reign, &amp; may he cause His redemption to sprout &amp; may He hasten His Messiah. [cong.

[cong. Amen.]
May peace be abundant from heaven, with life &amp; contentment, &amp; salvation &amp; solace, &amp; deliverance &amp; healing, &amp; redemption, &amp; forgiveness &amp; atonement &amp; plenty &amp; salvation, for us &amp; all His people Israel; &amp; say ye, Amen.

HEAR, O ISRAEL, Ado·nai Is Our G·D, Ado·nai Is ONE (cover eyes when above is said · think of Oneness of G·d)
Blessed be His Name &amp; glorious sovereignty forever.
     And you shall love the L·rd, your G·d, with all your heart &amp; with all your soul &amp; with all your might. And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house &amp; when you walk by the way, when your lie down &amp; when you rise up. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, &amp; they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house &amp; upon your gates. (Devarim / Deut. 6:4-9)
    And it shall be that if you hearken diligently unto My commandments which I command you today, to love the L·rd your G·d &amp; to serve Him with all your heart &amp; all your soul, then I will send rain for your land in its proper time, the autumn rain &amp; the spring rain, that you may gather in your grain, your wine &amp; your oil. And I will give grass in your field for your cattle &amp; you shall eat &amp; be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves lest your heart be deceived, &amp; you turn aside &amp; serve other gods &amp; bow to them. For then the L·rd's wrath will be kindled against you, &amp; He will close up the heavens that there be no rain, &amp; land shall not yield her produce, &amp; you shall perish quickly from off the goodly land which the L·rd gives you. You shall lay My words, these upon your heart &amp; upon your soul, &amp; you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, &amp; they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  And you shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down &amp; when you rise.  And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house &amp; upon your gates. So that the L·rd will lengthen your days &amp; the days of your children upon the land which the L·rd promised to give to your fathers, as the days of the heavens above the earth, (Devarim / Deuteronomy 11:13-21)
     And the L·rd spoke unto Moses, saying, speak unto the children of Israel &amp; say to them to make for themselves a fringe on the borders of their garments, throughout their generations. And they shall place upon the fringe of the border, a thread of blue wool.(From the sea worm bonellia viridis) And it shall be to you a fringe that you may look upon, &amp; remember all the commandments of the L·rd &amp; to do them. Then shall you not stray after your heart &amp; your eyes whereafter you are wont to stray. So may you remember &amp; do all My commandments &amp; be holy for your G·d.  I am the L·rd your G·d who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your G·d; I am the L·rd your G·d.  (Bamidbar / Numbers 15:37-41) True.
[And the Congregation Answers:] [This is] Truth: [And the Cantor Responds]: The L-rd, Your G-d, is True. 
And this matter [the Torah] stands, and is correct, and remains, and is straight and trustworthy and beloved and dear and pleasant and beautiful and awesome and mighty and structured and accepted and good and nice for us forever and ever.
Truth – You are the G·d of the Universe, our King, the Rock of Yaakov, Shield of our salvation. Every Generation He stands and His Hame stands. And His Throne is Stable and His Kingship and His Faith always stands, And His words are alive and standing and trustworthy and beloved forever (when one says “forever” kiss the Tzitzit in his hands, pass them over his eyes and release them from hands) And forever and ever. Upon our forefathers, upon us and upon our children, and upon our generation and upon every generation of the seed of Israel, Your servants, upon the first ones and upon the last ones – is is a good thing and it stands with truth, and faith, as a as a decree and it will not pass. Truth – that You are the L·rd, our G·d and G·d of our fathers, our King, King of our fathers. Our redeemer, Redeemer of our fathers. Our creator, the Rock of our redemption, [You are] our redeemer   and savior. From before [time] is Your Name, and we have no other G·d, besides You. Selah.
You are the Helper of our fathers – from ever before. A Shield and a Savior for them and their children after them – in every single generation. In the heights of the Universe is Your abode. And Your Justice and Righteousness arrives to the end of the earth. Truth – Happy is the man that listens to Your commandments and Your Torah [law] and Your Word he places upon his heart. Truth – that You are the Master of Your people and a Mighty King that fights their battles – for the fathers &amp; the children. Truth – that You are the first and You are the last and apart from You we have no king, redeemer or savior. Truth – From Egypt You redeemed us – L·rd, our G·d. From the house of bondage you ransomed us. All their first born You killed and Your first born – Yisrael – you redeemed. The Sea of Reeds, You split for them. And the intentionally wicked [Egyptians] You drowned. And the Beloved – passed [through] the sea. And the water covered their tormentors – not one of them remained. Upon this – give praise beloved ones – exultations to G·d, blessings and thanks to the King, Living and Standing G·d, Exalted &amp; Uplifted, Great &amp; Awesome, Who causes the Haughty to fall to the earth and the Lifts up the fallen to the heights. He takes out the emprisoned and redeems the humble , helps the pneedy and answers His people Yisrael at the time they Him.
(One Stands at this Point)
Praises to the lofty God – their Redeemer. Bless is He and [He is] the causer of blessing. Moses and the children of Israel – to You they answer in song with great exultation and they all say: Who is like You among the [false] gods [people worship] L·rd. Who is like You – Mighty in Holiness.  Awesome. Praises that do wonders. A new song – those redeemed [by You]  - to Your great name – on the banks of the sea. Together they acknowledged and acceped [Your] Kingship and said : The L·rd shall reign as King forever and ever. And it is said:  Our Redeemer, L·rd of Hosts is His name – the Holy One of [the people of] Israel. Blessed are you L·rd who redeemed [the people of]  Yisrael.

Kedousha (said in repetition of Amida in quorum of 10 men – in prayer alone skip to “You are Holy”)

We will sanctify You &amp; revere You, like the pleasant conversation, of the assembly of the holy Serafim (angels) that recite holiness thrice before You. And as it is written by Your prophet: And one calls to the other &amp; says : Holy, Holy, Holy is the L·rd of hosts; the entire world is filled with His glory. Those facing them, give praise &amp; say: Blessed is the honor of the L·rd from His place.

[When the priests stand on the platform after they recited the responsive <i>Modim</i>, they say:]<br>May it be Your Will before You, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that this blessing that You have commanded us to bless Your people Israel be a complete blessing and that there not be within it any obstacle or iniquity from now and forever. 
[During the prayer leader’s repetition, they now say the priestly blessing. If there is more than one priest, one of the congregants calls out:] Priests! [The priests recite the blessing:]<br>Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with the holiness of Aaron and commanded us to bless His people Israel with love. [Cong. answers, Amen!] 
[The prayer leader says the following one word at a time, with the priests repeating each word after him:]
May the Lord bless you and protect you. [Cong. answers, Amen!]
May the Lord shine His countenance upon you and give you grace.  [Cong. answers, Amen!]
May the Lord lift His countenance upon you and give you peace. [Cong. answers, Amen!]
[If there are no priests, the prayer leader says:]
Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing of the Torah, written by the hand of Moses Your servant, spoken by the mouth of Aaron and his sons, the priests, Your holy people – as it is said:
May the Lord bless you and protect you. [Cong. answers, Thus may it Be His Will!]
May the Lord shine His countenance upon you and give you grace. [Cong. answers, Thus may it Be His Will!]
May the Lord lift His countenance upon you and give you peace. [Cong. answers, Thus may it Be His Will!]
[When the prayer leader begins <i>Sim Shalom</i>, the priests turn their faces towards the sanctuary and say:]
Master of the worlds, we have done what You have decreed upon us. You [should then] do that which you have promised: <i>Look down from Your holy abode, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel</i> (Deuteronomy 26:15).
Establish peace, good, &amp; blessing, life, grace &amp; kindness, &amp; compassion upon us &amp; upon all Israel, Your Nation, &amp; bless us our Father all of us together with the light of Your countenance, For with the light of Your countenance, You gave us, L·rd, our G·d, Torah &amp; Life, Love &amp; Kindness, Righteousness &amp; Compassion, Blessing &amp; Peace, &amp; it is Good in Your eyes to bless us, &amp; to bless all Your people Israel, with great force &amp; peace. Blessed are You L·rd, Who Blesses His people of Israel with Peace. Amen.
May they find favor, the words of my mouth &amp; the thoughts of my heart, before You, L·rd, my Rock &amp; my Redeemer.
My G·d! Guard my tongue from Bad, &amp; my lips from [speaking] deceit. And those that curse me, let my soul be silent. And let my soul be like the dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah, &amp; after Your Mitzvot (commandments) let my soul pursue, &amp; all that rise against me for bad, quickly nullify their counsel &amp; ruin their thoughts. Do [it] for the sake of Your Name, do [it] for the sake of Your right (mercy), do [it] for the sake of Your Torah, do [it] for the sake of Your Holiness. For the sake of refraining Your beloved (Israel, from sufferance), Your right (mercy) Deliver [us], &amp; answer us. 

May they find favor [from You] - the saying of my mouth &amp; the reflections of my heart  before You, my L·rd, my Rock &amp; my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace from the heights, may He with His compassion, make peace upon us &amp; all His people Israel, &amp; [Let us] say, Amen.

Please L·rd, Our G·d and G·d of Our Fathers – Let Our Prayer come before You &amp; do not conceal Yourself, Our King, from our supplications. For we are not brazen faced &amp; stiff necked to say before You, L·rd, our G-d &amp; G-d of our Fathers – we are righteous and we have not sinned. Rather we have sinned, we have been crooked and transgressed – we and our fathers and the people of our household. We were guilty. We Rebelled. We Stole. We spoke slander and evil speech. We caused iniquity, We caused evil. We did intentional bad. We did violence. We accused falsely and deceitfully. We provided bad advice. We spoke falsity. We became angry. We mocked. We rebelled. We rebelled against your word. We provoked. We committed adultery. We left the path. We transgressed deliberately. We damaged. We caused pain. We caused pain to our father and mother. We were stiff necked. We were evil. We destroyed. We did despicable things. We made people err. We left Your Commandments and Your good laws &amp; they were not worthy of us. And You are righteous on everything that happens to us – for You did truth and we acted wickedly.
G·d, long to anger You are and a Master of mercy. The Greatness of Your mercifulness and kindness recall today for Your beloved seed, like You told the humble one [Moshe / Moses] from old. And also it is written in Your Torah: “And the L·rd descended in a cloud &amp; stood with him [Moshe/ Moses] there [in the tent of meeting]. And he called out with name – L·rd – and there it is said:...
And the L·rd passed by before him [Moshe] and he called: L·rd, L·rd – 1) G·d 2) Merciful &amp; 3) Gracious, 4) Long 5) to anger and 6) Great in Kindness 7) and Truth. 8) His Kindness is faithful 9) for thousands [of generations] 10) He bears iniquity, 11) and sin 12) and transgression 13) and absolves [those who repent].
Merciful &amp; Gracious One, We sinned before you – have mercy upon us and save us.
(say while seated)
[A Psalm] by David – To You L·rd do I lift my soul. My G·d I have faith in You – Don't let me be embarrassed or let my enemies exult. Also all who have faith – let them not be embarrassed, let the enemies be embarrassed for naught. Let me understand me your ways L·rd and teach me your paths. Guide me in your truth and teach [it to] me – for You are the G·d of my salvation – in You I have faith all day.  Remember Your mercy – L·rd – and Your kindness – for they are eternal. The sins of my youth and transgressions do not recall because of your kindness You remember me because of Your goodness. Good &amp; justare You L·rd – therefor You show sinners the [proper] path. You guide the humble with justice and You teach the humble his way. All the paths of the L·rd are kindness &amp; truth to those faithful to His covenant &amp; testimonies. For the sake of Your name L·rd – forgive my transgressions – for they are many. Who is this man that fears the L·rd – You lead him on the select path. His soul depends on good and his seed will inherit the land. The foundation of the L·rd is for those who fear Him and His covenant is for those that accept them. My eyes are constantly towards the L·rd – for he brings me out of the net on my feet. Turn to me and have grace upon me for I am unique and needy [person]. The sufferings of my heart have widened – from their pains You took me out. Observe my poverty and effort &amp; remove all my sins. Observe my enemies, for they have increased. And with a violent hate did they despise me. Guard my soul and save me don't make me embarrassed for I place my trust in You. Simple and just You formed me – thus I put my trust in You. Redeem G·d Yisrael from all who cause them pain. And He will redeem Yisrael from all its sins:
L·rd, G·d of Yisrael – return from Your wrathful anger. And have mercy on the evil to to your people. 
Our Father, Our King – You are our Father. Our Father, Our King We have no king, other than You.  Our Father, Our King have mercy on us.  Our Father, Our King – be Gracious and answer us – for we have no [valiant] deeds. Do righteousness and kindness with us – for the sake of Your great Name – and save us. And we – don't know what to do – for our eyes are upon You [to help us].
Recall Your mercy L·rd and Your kindness, for they are eternal. May your kindness L·rd be upon us – when we plead to You. Do not recall about us  - our first sins – quickly let your mercy precede it – for we were very lowly. Help us in the Name of the L·rd. For we  were subject greatly to degradation. In Your wrath, recall Your mercy. In Your wrath, recall Your love. L·rd save [us]! [You are] the King that answers on the day we call. For You knew our inclinations – remember that we are [only] dust. Help us – G·d of our salvation – for the matter of Your Name's honor. And save us and give atonement on our sins for the sake of Your Name.

Incense Offering
You are the L·rd, Our G·d, that our Forefathers burned before You the incense spices at the time that the Holy Temple stood – like You commanded them through Moshe, Your Prophet, like it is written in your Torah.
And the L·rd said to Moshe – Take for yourself spices- balsam sap / Nataf / &amp; onycha / Sh-h'elet  &amp; galbanum / H'elbona, spices &amp; pure frankincense / Levona  – each shall be of equal weight. And you shall prepare it (the spices) as incense – a compound, the work of a spice mixer, blended (or salted) pure &amp; holy. And you shall grind from it very well, and you shall take from it, before the [tent of] testimony – in the Tent of Meeting  - that I shall meet with you there – holy, holy it shall be for you. And it says – and Aharon shall offer as incense, the incense spices each &amp; every morning when he cleans the lamps he shall offer it. And when Aharon Ascends, he shall offer the incense – a regular incense offering before the L·rd – throughout your generations.
Our Rabbis Taught, The compound of the Incense, how was it done? Three-hundred &amp; Sixty-eight Maneh (a measure) was in it – 365 [maneh] – like the count of the days of the solar year. One Maneh daily – half in the morning and half in the evening and the three extra maneh – where those of which the Chief Kohen entered [the holy of holies] and took from them a full palm-full on the Yom Kippur – he would return them to the grinder on the eve of Yom Kippur, in order to accomplish the mitzvah – in the finest of finest [way] and 11 spices were in it – and these are they:
1) Balsam, 2) onycha, 3) &amp; galbanum 4) frankincense – the weight of 70 maneh each. 5) myrrh, 6) cassia &amp; 7) spikenard &amp; 8) saffron – [each] a weight of 16, 16 maneh. 9) costus – 12 maneh 10) aromatic bark – three [maneh] 11) cinnamon – 9 (maneh) [Added also were] Lye of Carsina – 9 Kavs (a measure), Wine of Cypres – 3 Seahs and 3 kavs- and if one did not find wine of Cypres – he brings old wine. Salt of Sodom – a quarter [of a kav.] An ascension of smoke – a small amount. Rabbi Nathan, the Babylonian, says – even the resin of the Jordan – a bit. If he put in it honey it is invalid and if he omitted one from all of its spices, he is liable for death [penalty].
Rabban Shimeon Son of Gamliel says : The Tzorit is sap, that flows from the Balsam tree. The Lye of Karsina, what does it come [to do]? – in order to rub the onycha in order for it to be beautiful. The wine of Cyprus, why is it brought? in order to soak in it the Onycha, in order for it to be sharp. But is not urine – better [to make it sharp] – rather we do not bring in urine into the Sanctuary out of respect.
We learned in [a Baraita] Rabbi Nathan Says -  When he chops – he says “Hadek Heitev, Hetitev Hadek / Chop Well, Well Chop” because the voice is good for spices. The incense compound divided in half is Kosher. For a third or a-quarter we did not hear [the law]. Rabbi Yehuda said “This is the general rule – if it is in the same proportion – it is Kosher for half, &amp; if it lacks one from all of the spices – he is liable for the death penalty. 
Bar Kapara taught once every sixty or seventy years there were remains [of the spices] of half. And Bar Kapparah also taught , if one was to add a Kartov [a measure] of honey a person would not be able to stand because of the fragrance. And why do we not mix in it honey? Because the Torah says  “For any leaven or any honey, do not offer incense from it – as a fire offering. L·rd of hosts, is with us. He is our refuge for us the G·d of Yaakov / Jacob forever. L·rd of hosts, happy is the man that has faith in You. L·rd save, the King will answer us on the day we call. And pleasant to the L·rd is the offering of Yehudah / Judah and Yerusalayim / Jerusalem – like the days of old. 

Please [G·d] with the power of the greatness of Your right hand, free the captive [Israel from its Exile].
Accept the singing [prayer] of Your people. Strengthen us &amp; purify us, Awesome One. 
Please, Mighty One, those that seek Your unity - like the pupil of the eyes - guard them. 
Bless them &amp; purify them. The mercy of Your righteousness always bestow upon them. 
Mighty &amp; Holy One with the abundance of your good, lead Your congregation. 
Single Exalted One, turn to Your people - those that remind of Your Holiness . 
Accept our pleading &amp; hear our wailing - [You] Who knows the hidden. 
(And Say Silently) ...
Blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom forever more. 














Exalted &amp; sanctified be His (G·d's) great Name.  [cong. Amen.] In this world that He created according to His will. May His Kingdom reign, &amp; may he cause His redemption to sprout &amp; may He hasten His Messiah. [cong. Amen.] In your lifetime &amp; in your days, &amp; in the lifetime of the whole house of Israel, speedily &amp; soon; &amp; say ye, Amen. [cong.

Amen.] Beyond all blessings, songs, praises &amp; consolations of this  world to express; &amp; say ye, Amen [cong. Amen.]

[cong. Amen.]
May peace be abundant from heaven, with life &amp; contentment, &amp; salvation &amp; solace, &amp; deliverance &amp; healing, &amp; redemption, &amp; forgiveness &amp; atonement &amp; plenty &amp; salvation, for us &amp; all His people Israel; &amp; say ye, Amen.

Alenu

Aleinu Leshabeah'
It is [incumbent] upon us to praise the L·rd of all. To bestow Greatness to the Molder of creation, for He did not make us as the nations of the lands, &amp; he did not establish us like the families of the earth, for He did not assign our portion as theirs, &amp; our lot like all the multitudes - for they bow to vanity &amp; emptiness &amp; pray to a god that saves not. And we bow before the King, the King of all Kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who spreads out the heavens &amp; creates the foundation of the earth. And the seat of His precious abode is in Heaven above &amp; the divine presence of his power, is in the highest heights. He is our G·d, &amp; there is no other. Our G·d is true, &amp; no other is beside Him. Like it is written in the Torah - "And you shall know today, &amp; you shall take it to heart, that it is the L·rd (Hash·m), Who is G·d in the heavens above &amp; upon the earth below. There is no other.”
Therefor, we will hope to You L·rd, our G·d to see speedily the glory of Your Might - to remove abominable idolatry from the earth &amp; the false gods be utterly terminated, to repair the world with the Kingship of the Al·mighty. And all living flesh will call in Your Name to turn back to You all the wicked of the earth. They will recognize &amp; will know, all the inhabitants of the earth, that to You that every knee shall bow down, &amp; every tongue. Before you they will kneel &amp; bow down &amp; give honor to Your glorious name &amp; they will all accept the yolk of Your Kingship. And Reign upon them speedily forever &amp; ever. For the Kingship, it is Yours. And forevermore reign in glory. Like it is written in your Torah, “The L·rd will reign forever &amp; ever.” And it is said “and it will be the L·rd will Be King upon all of the earth. On that day the L·rd will be One (ie, only He will be worshiped) &amp; His name One.” And in Your Torah, L·rd, Our G·d, it is written saying “Hear Oh Israel, the L·rd is our G·d the L·rd is One.”

Thirteen Principles of Faith

Additions for Morning Prayer
13 Fundamental  Principles of the Torah [Rambam]
I believe with perfect faith the 13 principles of the Holy Torah: 1. That the Holy One, Blessed Be He exists &amp; supervises. 2. &amp; that He is One 3. &amp; that He has no body &amp; no likeness of a body 4. &amp; He was before anything from before 5. &amp; that there is no worship except to Him. 6. &amp; He knows the thoughts of people. 7. &amp; the prophesy of Moses our teacher is true. 8. &amp; that he (Moses) is the master of all prophets. 9. &amp; that the Torah was given from Heaven. 10. &amp; that it [the Torah] will not change at any time, G-d Forbid. 11. &amp; that G·d punishes evil &amp; greatly rewards the good. 12. &amp; that the king Messiah will come. 13. &amp; that the dead will be resurrected in the future. May it be Your Will, Before You, L-rd, our G-d, and G-d of our Fathers, that you strengthen our inclination, to your Service - all the days of our life. Amen. Thus, May it be Your Will. 

Ten Remembrances



Weekday Mincha

Offerings

Weekday Afternoon Prayer 
For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, &amp; His Divine Presence – with awe &amp; love &amp; love &amp; awe - to unify of the Name of [letter] Yud, Hei with Vav Hei with a Complete Unity in the name of all Yisrael. Behold we come to pray the Afternoon Service, that was instituted by Yitzhak / Isaac  our Patriarch, peace be upon him, with all of the Mitzvot / commandments included in it, to repair its source in a high place, to give serenity to the One Who Formed us and to do the will of our Creator. May the goodwill of our L·rd, our G·d, be upon us. [Oh, G·d] establish our handiwork for us. And our handiwork establish (two times) (Tehillim / Psalm 84)
To the conductor: [set] on the Gitit (musical instrument from city of Gat) by the sons of Korah – a psalm: How beloved are your dwelling places (The Holy Temple / Beit Hamikdash) L·rd of Hosts. My soul yearns &amp; is consumed [with love] for Your courtyards, oh L·rd, my heart &amp; my flesh sing to [You, oh] Living G·d. Even the bird found a house &amp; a sparrow has its nest – that it places its fledglings (chicks) - upon Your altars - L·rd of hosts – my King &amp; my G·d.  Happy are those that dwell in Your house – they will praise You forever more. Happy is the man that finds his strength in You [Hash·m] - whose paths [wishing to travel to Beit Hamikdash] are in their hearts. Those that traverse the valley of tears, will make it a spring &amp; also blessings will enwrap those who taught. They will go from strength to strength &amp; will appear before G·d in Tzion. L·rd, G·d of hosts, hear my prayer &amp; listen G·d of Yaakov forever. See our shield (the Temple), G·d &amp; let us see the face of Your anointed one. For greater is one day in Your courtyard G·d than a 1000 [days in exile], I have chosen [to stand] at the threshold of the house of G·d than to live [in comfort] among tents of the wicked. For a sun &amp; shield [are You] L·rd - my G·d, grace &amp; honor do you give L·rd - You do not withhold good from those that go in simple faith. L·rd of Hosts - Fortunate is the man that trusts in You.
[The Daily Offering (Numbers 28:1-8)]  And the L·rd Spoke to Moshe saying: Command the Children of Israel and say to them – My Offering – Bread for the Fire Offering is My pleasing aroma – Be careful to offer it in its [proper] time. And you shall say to them this is the fire-offering that you shall offer to the L·rd – perfect sheep of one year [old], two daily as a Regular Burnt Offering. One sheep you shall do in the morning and the second sheep you shall do in the afternoon. And a tenth of an Ephah (a measure) of fine flour for the gift offering mixed with pressed oil - one-fourth of a hin (a measure). A regular burnt- offering [like] that was done on Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma – a Fire-Offering to the L·rd. And its libation – is a quarter of a hin (a measure) for one sheep in the Sanctuary  - pour a libation of old wine for the L·rd. And the second sheep you shall do in the afternoon like the Meal-Offering of the morning and like its libation do as a fire-offering – a pleasant aroma to the L·rd.
[Incense Offering] You are the L·rd, Our G·d, that our Forefathers burned before You the incense spices at the time that the Holy Temple stood – like You commanded them through Moshe, Your Prophet, like it is written in your Torah.
And the L·rd said to Moshe – Take for yourself spices- balsam sap / Nataf / &amp; onycha / Sh-h'elet  &amp; galbanum / H'elbona, spices &amp; pure frankincense / Levona  – each shall be of equal weight. And you shall prepare it (the spices) as incense – a compound, the work of a spice mixer, blended (or salted) pure &amp; holy. And you shall grind from it very well, and you shall take from it, before the [tent of] testimony – in the Tent of Meeting  - that I shall meet with you there – holy, holy it shall be for you. And it says – and Aharon shall offer as incense, the incense spices each &amp; every morning when he cleans the lamps he shall offer it. And when Aharon Ascends, he shall offer the incense – a regular incense offering before the L·rd – throughout your generations.
Our Rabbis Taught, The compound of the Incense, how was it done? Three-hundred &amp; Sixty-eight Maneh (a measure) was in it – 365 [maneh] – like the count of the days of the solar year. One Maneh daily – half in the morning and half in the evening and the three extra maneh – where those of which the Chief Kohen entered [the holy of holies] and took from them a full palm-full on the Yom Kippur – he would return them to the grinder on the eve of Yom Kippur, in order to accomplish the mitzvah – in the finest of finest [way] and 11 spices were in it – and these are they:
1) Balsam, 2) onycha, 3) &amp; galbanum 4) frankincense – the weight of 70 maneh each. 5) myrrh, 6) cassia &amp; 7) spikenard &amp; 8) saffron – [each] a weight of 16, 16 maneh. 9) costus – 12 maneh 10) aromatic bark – three [maneh] 11) cinnamon – 9 (maneh) [Added also were] Lye of Carsina – 9 Kavs (a measure), Wine of Cypres – 3 Seahs and 3 kavs- and if one did not find wine of Cypres – he brings old wine. Salt of Sodom – a quarter [of a kav.] An ascension of smoke – a small amount. Rabbi Nathan, the Babylonian, says – even the resin of the Jordan – a bit. If he put in it honey it is invalid and if he omitted one from all of its spices, he is liable for death [penalty]. 
Rabban Shimeon Son of Gamliel says : The Tzorit is sap, that flows from the Balsam tree. The Lye of Karsina, what does it come [to do]? – in order to rub the onycha in order for it to be beautiful. The wine of Cyprus, why is it brought? in order to soak in it the Onycha, in order for it to be sharp. But is not urine – better [to make it sharp] – rather we do not bring in urine into the Sanctuary out of respect.
We learned in [a Baraita] Rabbi Nathan Says -  When he chops – he says “Hadek Heitev, Hetitev Hadek / Chop Well, Well Chop” because the voice is good for spices. The incense compound divided in half is Kosher. For a third or a-quarter we did not hear [the law]. Rabbi Yehuda said “This is the general rule – if it is in the same proportion – it is Kosher for half, &amp; if it lacks one from all of the spices – he is liable for the death penalty. 
Bar Kapara taught once every sixty or seventy years there were remains [of the spices] of half. And Bar Kapparah also taught , if one was to add a Kartov [a measure] of honey a person would not be able to stand because of the fragrance. And why do we not mix in it honey? Because the Torah says  “For any leaven or any honey, do not offer incense from it – as a fire offering. L·rd of hosts, is with us. He is our refuge for us the G·d of Yaakov / Jacob forever. L·rd of hosts, happy is the man that has faith in You. L·rd save, the King will answer us on the day we call. And pleasant to the L·rd is the offering of Yehudah / Judah and Yerusalayim / Jerusalem – like the days of old. 
Happy are those that dwell in Your house, they will yet praise You forever. Happy is the people for whom this is so, happy is the people that the L·rd is their G·d.
A praise of David, I will exalt You my G·d, the King, &amp; I will bless Your Name forever &amp; ever. Every day I will bless you, &amp; I will laud Your Name forever &amp; ever. Great is the L·rd &amp; He is greatly lauded, &amp; His Greatness is unfathomable. Generation to generation will praise Your deeds, &amp; Your mighty acts they will relate. The splendorous glory of Your Majesty &amp; Your wondrous acts I shall discuss. And the might of Your awesome acts they will speak &amp; Your greatness, I will relate. A recollection of Your great goodness they will express &amp; Your righteousness they will sing. Gracious &amp; Merciful is the L·rd, Slow-to anger &amp; Great in kindness. The L·rd is good to all &amp; His Mercies are on all His works. All Your works shall thank You, L·rd, &amp; Your pious ones shall bless You. Of the glory of Your Kingdom they will relate, &amp; Your Might they shall speak.To inform human beings of Your Mighty acts &amp; of the glorious Majesty of His Kingdom. Your Kingship is Kingship of all worlds &amp; Your dominion is for all generations.The L·rd supports all those who fall, &amp; He straightens all who are bent over. The eyes of all are [looking] upon You for hope, &amp; You provide them their food in the proper time. * You open Your hand, &amp; You satisfy all the living's wants. Righteous is the L·rd in all His ways, &amp; Pious in all His deeds. The L·rd is close to all who call Him, to all that call upon Him with sincerity. The will of those that fear Him He will do, &amp; their cries He will hear &amp; save them. The L·rd protects all who love Him, &amp; all of the wicked He will destroy. Praise of the L·rd will my mouth speak, &amp; all flesh shall bless His holy Name for ever &amp; ever. And we will bless G·d from now to eternity. [Let us all] Praise G·d!
Fix my prayer before you as an incense offering – my handiwork, as a pleasant gift offering. Listen to the voice of my pleas, my King and my G·d, for [only] to you do I pray.
(Prayer Leader says H'atzi- Kaddish)

Confession
Please L·rd, Our G·d and G·d of Our Fathers – Let Our Prayer come before You &amp; do not conceal Yourself, Our King, from our supplications. For we are not brazen faced &amp; stiff necked to say before You, L·rd, our G-d &amp; G-d of our Fathers – we are righteous and we have not sinned. Rather we have sinned, we have been crooked and transgressed – we and our fathers and the people of our household. We were guilty. We Rebelled. We Stole. We spoke slander and evil speech. We caused iniquity, We caused evil. We did intentional bad. We did violence. We accused falsely and deceitfully. We provided bad advice. We spoke falsity. We became angry. We mocked. We rebelled. We rebelled against your word. We provoked. We committed adultery. We left the path. We transgressed deliberately. We damaged. We caused pain. We caused pain to our father and mother. We were stiff necked. We were evil. We destroyed. We did despicable things. We made people err. We left Your Commandments and Your good laws &amp; they were not worthy of us. And You are righteous on everything that happens to us – for You did truth and we acted wickedly.
G·d, long to anger You are and a Master of mercy. The Greatness of Your mercy and kindness recall today for Your beloved seed, like You told the humble one [Moshe / Moses] from old. And also it is written in Your Torah: “And the L·rd descended in a cloud &amp; stood with him [Moshe/ Moses] there [in the tent of meeting]. And he called out with name – L·rd – and there it is said:
And the L·rd passed by before him [Moshe] and he called: L·rd, L·rd – 1) G·d 2) Merciful &amp; 3) Gracious, 4) Long 5) to anger and 6) Great in Kindness 7) and Truth. 8) His Kindness is faithful 9) for thousands [of generations] 10) He bears iniquity, 11) and sin 12) and transgression 13) and absolves [those who repent].
Merciful &amp; Gracious One, We sinned before you – have mercy upon us and save us.
(say while seated)
[A Psalm] by David – To You L·rd do I lift my soul. My G·d I have faith in You – Don't let me be embarrassed or let my enemies exult. Also all who have faith – let them not be embarrassed, let the enemies be embarrassed for naught. Let me understand me your ways L·rd and teach me your paths. Guide me in your truth and teach [it to] me – for You are the G·d of my salvation – in You I have faith all day.  Remember Your mercy – L·rd – and Your kindness – for they are eternal. The sins of my youth and transgressions do not recall because of your kindness You remember me because of Your goodness. Good &amp; justare You L·rd – therefor You show sinners the [proper] path. You guide the humble with justice and You teach the humble his way. All the paths of the L·rd are kindness &amp; truth to those faithful to His covenant &amp; testimonies. For the sake of Your name L·rd – forgive my transgressions – for they are many. Who is this man that fears the L·rd – You lead him on the select path. His soul depends on good and his seed will inherit the land. The foundation of the L·rd is for those who fear Him and His covenant is for those that accept them. My eyes are constantly towards the L·rd – for he brings me out of the net on my feet. Turn to me and have grace upon me for I am unique and needy [person]. The sufferings of my heart have widened – from their pains You took me out. Observe my poverty and effort &amp; remove all my sins. Observe my enemies, for they have increased. And with a violent hate did they despise me. Guard my soul and save me don't make me embarrassed for I place my trust in You. Simple and just You formed me – thus I put my trust in You. Redeem G·d Yisrael from all who cause them pain. And He will redeem Yisrael from all its sins
L·rd, G·d of Yisrael – return from Your wrathful anger. And have mercy on the evil to to your people. 
Our Father, Our King – You are our Father. Our Father, Our King We have no king, other than You.  Our Father, Our King have mercy on us.  Our Father, Our King – be Gracious and answer us – for we have no [valiant] deeds. Do righteousness and kindness with us – for the sake of Your great Name – and save us. And we – don't know what to do – for our eyes are upon You [to help us].
Recall Your mercy L·rd and Your kindness, for they are eternal. May your kindness L·rd be upon us – when we plead to You. Do not recall about us  - our first sins – quickly let your mercy precede it – for we were very lowly. Help us in the Name of the L·rd. For we  were subject greatly to degradation. In Your wrath, recall Your mercy. In Your wrath, recall Your love. L·rd save [us]! [You are] the King that answers on the day we call. For You knew our inclinations – remember that we are [only] dust. Help us – G·d of our salvation – for the matter of Your Name's honor. And save us and give atonement on our sins for the sake of Your Name.

On Friday Afternoon - we say Mizmor of "Hash-m Melech" instead of "Lamnatzeac'"
The L·rd has reigned. He attired Himself in Majesty. The L·rd has attired &amp; girded Himself with might. You also established the world [that]  it should not falter. Your Throne is established from old, You have always been. The rivers have lifted, L·rd. The rivers have lifted up their voice. The rivers will lift up their nadir. [Mightier] than the voices of many waters [&amp; than] the powerful waves of the sea are You, in the lofty heights, L·rd. Your Testimonies are extremely trustworthy,  concerning Your House, the Holy Dwelling; L·rd – for the length of days. (Tehillim / Psalm 93)

Alenu

Aleinu Leshabeah'
It is [incumbent] upon us to praise the L·rd of all. To bestow Greatness to the Molder of creation, for He did not make us as the nations of the lands, &amp; he did not establish us like the families of the earth, for He did not assign our portion as theirs, &amp; our lot like all the multitudes - for they bow to vanity &amp; emptiness &amp; pray to a god that saves not. And we bow before the King, the King of all Kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who spreads out the heavens &amp; creates the foundation of the earth. And the seat of His precious abode is in Heaven above &amp; the divine presence of his power, is in the highest heights. He is our G·d, &amp; there is no other. Our G·d is true, &amp; no other is beside Him. Like it is written in the Torah - "And you shall know today, &amp; you shall take it to heart, that it is the L·rd (Hash·m), Who is G·d in the heavens above &amp; upon the earth below. There is no other.”
Therefore, we will hope to You L·rd, our G·d to see speedily the glory of Your Might - to remove abominable idolatry from the earth &amp; the false gods be utterly terminated, to repair the world with the Kingship of the Al·mighty. And all living flesh will call in Your Name to turn back to You all the wicked of the earth. They will recognize &amp; will know, all the inhabitants of the earth, that to You that every knee shall bow down, &amp; every tongue. Before you they will kneel &amp; bow down &amp; give honor to Your glorious name &amp; they will all accept the yolk of Your Kingship. And Reign upon them speedily forever &amp; ever. For the Kingship, it is Yours. And forevermore reign in glory. Like it is written in your Torah, “The L·rd will reign forever &amp; ever.” And it is said “and it will be the L·rd will Be King upon all of the earth. On that day the L·rd will be One (ie, only He will be worshiped) &amp; His name One.” And in Your Torah, L·rd, Our G·d, it is written saying “Hear Oh Israel, the L·rd is our G·d the L·rd is One.”

Weekday Arvit

Barchu

The Prayer of A'rvit / Evening for Regular Weekdays
On the Night of Rosh H'odesh - there are those that have custom to say this Mizmor, before A'rvit
Bless my soul L·rd. L·rd - my G·d – You are Very Great – Majesty &amp; splendor You have attired; He enwraps [Himself] with light like a garment, [and] stretches out the heavens like a curtain. He Who roofs with waters His upper chambers. He makes the clouds His chariot – Who walks on the wings of wind. Who makes His Messengers [from] winds – His servants – are flaming fire. He founded the earth upon its firmament – it will not falter forever. The depths, as with a garment He covered them, upon the mountains stand the water. From Your rebuke they flee; from the voice of your Thunder – they rushed away; Ascending mountains and descending to valleys – to this place that you founded for them. A boundary did You establish without letting them pass; without letting them return to cover the earth. He sends streams in the valleys, between the mountains they flow. They (the rivers) irrigate all of the beasts the field, they satiate the wild animals thirst. Near them do birds of the sky dwell, from among the branches they give their voice [in song]. He irrigates mountains from His upper chambers, with the fruits of Your handiwork You satiate the earth. He sprouts grass for the animals and vegetation for the service, for man to extract bread from the earth. And wine gladdens the heart of man – to make the face shine from oil and with bread are the hearts of man satiated. You satiate the trees – L·rd – the cedars of Lebanon – that were planted. Where are birds – You direct the stork with to her house in the junipers. High mountains are for the chamois - rocks a refuge for the rock badgers. He made the moon for the seasons – the sun to know its coming. You spread Darkness and it is night – when all creatures swarm the forest. The Young lions roar upon their prey – and ask from G·d their food. You shine the sun – and gather them and to their dwelling they go to lie. A man goes to his labor and to his work while it is night. How great are Your works, L·rd, all of them with great wisdom did You make them – the earth is full of Your creatures. This is the great ocean – and width of hands – there swarms – and there uncountable small creatures with the large ones. There the ships go – this You created to  sail in it. All of them you give sustenance – to give them food in their proper time. You give to them their gatherings, You open your hands and hey are sustained well. You conceal Your face – they are bewildered – You remove their breath and they die and they return to their dust. You send Your spirit – you created them and renew the face of the earth. May the Honor of the L·rd be eternal  - let the L·rd rejoice in his creations. He looks to the earth and it trembles, He touches the mountains and they smoke. I will sing to the L·rd while alive, I will chant to my G·d while I still remain [alive]. I will make my conversations pleasant to Him – I will rejoice with the L·rd. Sins will cease from the land and the wicked will be no more – Bless my soul L·rd – Halleluy-a (Tehillim / Psalm 104)
For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, &amp; His Divine Presence – with awe &amp; love &amp; love &amp; awe - to unify of the Name of [letter] Yud, Hei with Vav Hei with a Complete Unity in the name of all Yisrael. Behold we come to pray the Evening Service, that was instituted by Yaakov / Jacob our Patriarch, peace be upon him, with all of the Mitzvot / commandments included in it, to repair the source in a high place, to give serenity to the One Who Formed us and to do  the will of our Creator. May the goodwill of our L·rd, our G·d, be upon us. [Oh, G·d] establish our handiwork for us. And our handiwork establish (two times)
The L·rd of Hosts is with us – He is a refuge for us – the G-d of Yaakov / Jacob forever. L·rd of Hosts – happy is the one who has trust in you . L·rd, Save, [You] are the King that Answers on the day we call.

The Shema

Recitation of Shema and Its Blessings
Blessed are You, L·rd, Our G-d, King of the Universe – that with His word – he brings forth nights – with wisdom. He opens the gates with understanding. He changes the time periods and exchanges the time schedules and sets in order the stars – in their watches in the heavens according to His will – he creates day and night. He removes light for darkness and [removes] darkness for light. He clears away day and brings night and makes a separation between day and between night. L·rd, L·rd of Hosts is His Name. Blessed are You, L·rd – that brings upon nights. 
With Eternal Love of the House of Israel – Your people – you loved – Torah &amp; Mitzvot &amp; decrees and ordinances – You taught us. Therefore, L·rd our G-d, upon our lying down and upon our rising – we will converse in your laws and rejoice and exult in the words of Your Torah's Teachings, and commandments and decrees forever more. For they are our lives and the length of our days, and with them we will delve day and night. And your love – do not remove from us forever – Blessed are You, L·rd, who loves his people – Yisrael.

HEAR, O ISRAEL, Ado·nai Is Our G·D, Ado·nai Is ONE 
(Silently) Blessed be His Name &amp; glorious sovereignty forever. 
And you shall love the L·rd, your G·d, with all your heart &amp; with all your soul &amp; with all your might. And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house &amp; when you walk by the way, when your lie down &amp; when you rise up. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, &amp; they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house &amp; upon your gates. (Devarim / Deut. 6:4-9) 
And it shall be that if you hearken diligently unto My commandments which I command you today, to love the L·rd your G·d &amp; to serve Him with all your heart &amp; all your soul, then I will send rain for your land in its proper time, the autumn rain &amp; the spring rain, that you may gather in your grain, your wine &amp; your oil. And I will give grass in your field for your cattle &amp; you shall eat &amp; be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves lest your heart be deceived, &amp; you turn aside &amp; serve other gods &amp; bow to them. For then the L·rd's wrath will be kindled against you, &amp; He will close up the heavens that there be no rain, &amp; land shall not yield her produce, &amp; you shall perish quickly from off the goodly land which the L·rd gives you. You shall lay My words, these upon your heart &amp; upon your soul, &amp; you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, &amp; they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. And you shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down &amp; when you rise. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house &amp; upon your gates. So that the L·rd will lengthen your days &amp; the days of your children upon the land which the L·rd promised to give to your fathers, as the days of the heavens above the earth (Devarim / Deuteronomy 11:13-21) 
And the L·rd spoke unto Moses, saying, speak unto the children of Israel &amp; say to them to make for themselves a fringe on the borders of their garments, throughout their generations. And they shall place upon the fringe of the border, a thread of blue wool. And it shall be to you a fringe that you may look upon, &amp; remember all the commandments of the L·rd &amp; to do them. Then shall you not stray after your heart &amp; your eyes whereafter you are wont to stray. So may you remember &amp; do all My commandments &amp; be holy for your G·d. I am the L·rd your G·d who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your G·d; I am the L·rd your G·d. (Bamidbar / Numbers 15:37-41) (Cong. Answers) True. (Repeat &amp; Say) The L-rd, Your G-d is True. 
and [we have] Faith in all this – and it is established for us, for He is the L·rd Our G-d &amp; there is none other than Him – and we are Yisrael, His people. [He is] The One Who redeems us from the hand of kings, Our King, Who Delivers us from from the hands of all tyrants, the G-d that avenges for us those that cause us pain, the One that will pay back all that was bestowed upon us to all the enemies of our souls, the One Who keeps our souls alive, and did not allow our feet to stumble, the One Who guides us upon the altars of our enemies. And who raises our countenance [horn] upon all our foes, the G-d that takes vengeance upon Pharaoh, with signs and wonders – in the land of the people of H'am, the One that Strikes with His wrath all the first-born of Egypt, &amp; He Brings out His people, Yisrael from among them to eternal freedom. Who causes His children to pass between the splittings of the Sea of Reeds, &amp; their pursuers &amp; their foes He drowned in the depths. His children observed His might – &amp; gave praise &amp; lauded Him for His Name's sake – &amp; His Kingship, they willingly,  accepted upon themselves. Moshe / Moses &amp; the Children of Yisrael answered with Song &amp; great joy, &amp; they all said “Who is like You among the mighty,  L·rd. Who is like You supreme in holiness, [too] awesome [for] praises - Who does wonders.  Your Kingship, L·rd, our G-d Your Children saw by the Sea, united all of them gave thanks and accepted Your Kingship and said “The L·rd will reign, forever more.” And it is said “For the L·rd redeemed Yaakov / Jacob &amp; he saved him from the hand of one stronger than he.” (Jeremiah 31:10) Blessed are You L·rd, who redeems Yisrael.
...Lay us down, our Father, in peace, &amp; raise us up, our King, for a good life &amp; peace. And spread upon us the shelter of Your peace, &amp; fix us, our King, with good advice before You. And deliver us speedily for the sake of Your name.

And they will praise, &amp; they will bless Your Great Name truely, constantly, for It is good, the G·d of our Salvation &amp; our Assistance, the Good G·d. Blessed are You L·rd, the Good, Your Name &amp; You are befitting to give thanks.
Establish peace, good, &amp; blessing, life, grace &amp; kindness, &amp; compassion upon us &amp; upon all Israel, Your Nation, &amp; bless us our Father all of us together with the light of Your countenance, For with the light of Your countenance, You gave us, L·rd, our G·d, Torah &amp; Life, Love &amp; Kindness, Righteousness &amp; Compassion, Blessing &amp; Peace, &amp; it is Good in Your eyes to bless us, &amp; to bless all Your people Israel, with great force &amp; peace. Blessed are You L·rd, Who Blesses His people of Israel with Peace. Amen.
May they find favor, the words of my mouth &amp; the thoughts of my heart, before You, L·rd, my Rock &amp; my Redeemer.
My G·d! Guard my tongue from Bad, &amp; my lips from [speaking] deceit. And those that curse me, let my soul be silent. And let my soul be like the dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah, &amp; after Your Mitzvot (commandments) let my soul pursue, &amp; all that rise against me for bad, quickly nullify their counsel &amp; ruin their thoughts. Do [it] for the sake of Your Name, do [it] for the sake of Your right (mercy), do [it] for the sake of Your Torah, do [it] for the sake of Your Holiness. For the sake of refraining Your beloved (Israel, from sufferance), Your right (mercy) Deliver [us], &amp; answer us. 

...May they find favor [from You] - the saying of my mouth &amp; the reflections of my heart  before You, my L·rd, my Rock &amp; my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace from the heights, may He with His compassion, make peace upon us &amp; all His people Israel, &amp; [Let us] say, Amen. 
May it be Your will before You, L·rd, Our G-d and G-d of our fathers – that You build the Holy Temple speedily in our days. And give us our share in Your Torah – to do the laws of Your will and to serve You with a perfect heart.
May the Name of the L·rd be Blessed from Now and evermore. From the East of the Sun until its rising – praised is the Name of the L·rd. Exalted above all nations – is the L·rd – upon the heavens which he Honors. L·rd – our Master – How mighty is Your name throughout the land.




Behold I prepare myself to accept the light of the addition on the holiness of Shabbat to the weekdays. And I will sancify, with the help of G·d, May He be Blessed, on the days of the week with the holiness of Shabbat – like the L·rd, Our G·d commanded us, in His holy Torah. “And you shall sanctify yourself and you will be holy.” And may it be your will before you, L·rd, our G·d, and G·d of out fathers – that it shall rise before you as if I concentrated on all proper intentions with this.
Return, L·rd, until when? And have console Your servant. Gratify us in the morning with your kindness and we will sing and rejoice in all our days. Let us rejoice like the days of our suffering – the years bad. Show Your servant Your deeds, and return it upon their children. And may the Grace of the L·rd, our G·d be upon us and the work of our hands- guide for us and our handiwork guide it.
 He who sits in the shelter of the Supreme One, in the Shadow of the L·rd will he dwell. I say to the L·rd "You are my refuge &amp; my fortress my L·rd, I will trust in Him" For He will save you from the ensnared trap from destructive pestilence. With his pinion will he cover you, &amp; under His wings you will be protected. Shield &amp; Armor are His truth. You shall not fear from terror of night, [nor] from the arrow that flies by day. From pestilence that stalks in the dark, from a destroyer that ravages at noon. A thousand will encamp at your [left] side &amp; ten-thousand by your right &amp; to you they will not come near. Only with your eyes you shall peer, &amp; the retribution of the wicked you shall see. Because [you said] "You, L·rd are my refuge" you made the Supreme G·d your abode. No evil shall befall you &amp; a plague will not arrive to your tent. For His angels He will command for you, to protect you in all your ways. On palms they will carry you, lest you stub your foot on a stone. Upon a lion &amp; a serpent you shall tread, you will trample a young lion &amp; a snake. Because he desired My Name - I will protect him &amp; I will lift him - for he knows My Name. He will call Me &amp; I will answer him - I am with him in distress &amp; I will release him &amp; Honor him I will satiate him with longevity of days &amp; I will demonstrate to him My salvation.
And You are Holy, throned upon the praises of Israel. And One [angel] calls to the Other and says: Holy, Holy, Holy is the L·rd of Legions, He fills the entire world with His Glory. (silently) And each one [angel] accepts [permission]  from another and says: He is Holy in the High Exalted heavens, the abode of His Divine presence, Sanctified on the Earth,  His Greatness is worshiped; Sanctified forever and ever L·rd of Legions - The entire earth is filled with His precious illumination.  (Aloud) And a wind carried me my and I heard behind me the sound of great noise - blessed is the Honor of the L·rd from His place. (Quietly) And a wind lifted me and I heard behind me the sound of a powerful movement of those that praise , saying Blessed is the preciousness of the L·rd from the His place – the house of His Divine Presence. (Aloud) The L·rd will reign forever and ever. (Quietly) The L·rd, His Kingship is established forever and ever. (Aloud) L·rd, G·d of Avraham, Yitzhak and Yisrael – our forefathers, may You preserve this forever, as the realization of the thoughts of the hearts of Your people and direct their hearts towards you.  And He is merciful,  and He will atone for transgression, He will not destroy, and he frequently removes His anger and He will not ignite His entire wrath. For You my L·rd are Good and Forgiving, and abundant in kindness to all that call You. Your righteousness is righteousness forever, and Your Torah / Law is truth. Give truth to Yaakov, kindness to Avraham that You swore to our fathers in the days of yore. Blessed is the L·rd  - every day He is a stronghold for us, the G·d of our Salvation forever. L·rd of Hosts, happy is the person who trusts in you. L·rd Save! The King that answers us on the day we call.
Blessed is our L·rd that created us in his honor, and separated us from those who are wayward, and gave us the Torah of Truth, and life of the world He planted among us. May He open our hearts to His Torah &amp; place in our hearts His Love and Awe to do His will and to serve Him with a complete heart. Let us not toil in vain, let us not be born for pursuit of vanities. May it be a will Before You, L·rd our G·d that Your laws be observed [by me] in this world and I will merit and live and inherit good and blessing  to life of the World to Come. In order that I shall sing of Your Honor and I will not be silent. (pause) L·rd, My G·d, forever I will thank You. The L·rd wanted, due to His righteousness, that the Torah be increased and strengthened. And They will Have Faith in You, those that know Your name, for You did not abandon, those that seek You, L·rd. L·rd, our Master, How mighty is Your name throughout the World. Strengthen and Fortify your hearts all those that put their trust in the L·rd. 





A Song of Ascents - I raise my eyes [upward] towards the mountains – [to find] from where will my assistance arrive? My Assistance is from the L·rd - Maker of Heaven &amp; Earth. He will not let your foot falter. Your Guardian will not slumber. Behold He does not slumber nor sleep -  the Guardian of Israel. The L·rd is your Guardian; He is your Shadow at your right side. By day, the sun will not harm you nor the moon by night. The L·rd will protect you from all evil - He will guard your soul. The L·rd will guard your departure &amp; arrival from now &amp; forever more.

Alenu

A'leinu LeShabeah' / Upon us to Praise
It is [incumbent] upon us to praise the L·rd of all. To bestow Greatness to the Molder of creation, for He did not make us as the nations of the lands, &amp; he did not establish us like the families of the earth, for He did not assign our portion as theirs, &amp; our lot like all the multitudes - for they bow to vanity &amp; emptiness &amp; pray to a god that saves not. And we bow before the King, the King of all Kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who spreads out the heavens &amp; creates the foundation of the earth. And the seat of His precious abode is in Heaven above &amp; the divine presence of his power, is in the highest heights. He is our G·d, &amp; there is no other. Our G·d is true, &amp; no other is beside Him. Like it is written in the Torah - "And you shall know today, &amp; you shall take it to heart, that it is the L·rd (Hash·m), Who is G·d in the heavens above &amp; upon the earth below. There is no other.”
Therefore, we will hope to You L·rd, our G·d to see speedily the glory of Your Might - to remove abominable idolatry from the earth &amp; the false gods be utterly terminated, to repair the world with the Kingship of the Al·mighty. And all living flesh will call in Your Name to turn back to You all the wicked of the earth. They will recognize &amp; will know, all the inhabitants of the earth, that to You that every knee shall bow down, &amp; every tongue. Before you they will kneel &amp; bow down &amp; give honor to Your glorious name &amp; they will all accept the yolk of Your Kingship. And Reign upon them speedily forever &amp; ever. For the Kingship, it is Yours. And forevermore reign in glory. Like it is written in your Torah, “The L·rd will reign forever &amp; ever.” And it is said “and it will be the L·rd will Be King upon all of the earth. On that day the L·rd will be One (ie, only He will be worshiped) &amp; His name One.” And in Your Torah, L·rd, Our G·d, it is written saying “Hear Oh Israel, the L·rd is our G·d the L·rd is One.”

For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, &amp; His Divine Presence &amp; His Fear &amp; His Mercy &amp; His Mercy &amp; His Fear, to unify of the Name of letter Yud, letter Hei with letter Vav letter Hei with a Complete Unity in the name of all Yisrael to lift the Divine Presence from the dust &amp; to raise the Divine Presence – our Force. Behold I accept upon myself the Divinity of the Blessed One [Hash·m] &amp; His love &amp; His fear. And behold I fear from him because he is the master &amp; rules over all, &amp; all is before Him entirely. And behold I accept His Sovereignty on each &amp; every member &amp; vein from the  248 members &amp; 365 veins of my body &amp; my soul – a total &amp; complete sovereignty. And behold I am a servant to the L·rd May He Be Blessed. And He in His Mercy will aid us to Merit to serve Him with a complete heart &amp; a willing soul. Amen – May it be His Will.

Master of the Universe, behold I forgive &amp; pardon anyone who  angered me, or antagonized me or who sinned against me, whether relating to my body, or my money, or my honor, or anything that belongs to me, whether done accidentally, or willingly, unintentionally or intentionally, or whether with words, whether with actions, whether in this present incarnation, whether in another incarnation - any person of Israel. And may no person be punished because of me. May it be Your will, My G·d, &amp; G·d of my forefathers, that I will not sin again. And that that I did sin erase with Your abundant mercies, however, not through suffering or bad illnesses. May the expressions of my mouth &amp; the thoughts of my heart find favor before You, G·d, my Rock &amp; my Redeemer.
On Nights of Weekday we Say<br>Lay us down, our Father, in peace, &amp; raise us up, our King, for a good life &amp; peace. And spread upon us the shelter of Your peace, &amp; fix us, our King, with good advice before You. And deliver us speedily for the sake of Your name. And guard us, &amp; refrain from us the striking of an enemy, pestilence, the sword, illness, suffering, evil, &amp; pain &amp; destruction &amp; plague. Break &amp; remove the bad force from before us &amp; after us. And in the shadow of Your wings hide us. And guard our goings &amp; comings for good life &amp; peace from now &amp; ever more. For You are G·d that guards us &amp; saves us from all evil occurrence &amp; from the terror of night. Blessed is the One that guards His people Israel for eternity.<br><br>On Nights of Shabbat &amp; Holy Days we Say<br>Lay us down, our Father, in peace, &amp; raise us up, our King, for a good life &amp; peace. And spread upon us the shelter of Your peace, &amp; fix us, our King, with good advice before You. And deliver us speedily for the sake of Your name. And guard us, and spread upon us and upon Jerusalem your city your shelter of peace. Blessed is the One spreads the shelter of peace upon us and upon His entire people Israel and upon Jerusalem.
Blessed [are You, L·rd, our G·d, King of the Universe] that casts the pangs of sleep upon my eyes, &amp; slumber upon my eyelids, &amp; that enlightens the pupil of the Eye. May it be Your will, L·rd, my G·d , &amp; G·d of my forefathers, that You will lay me down in peace, &amp; that You will raise me up for good life &amp; peace. And place my portion in your Torah &amp; accustom me in a matter of Mitzvah. And don't accustom me to a matter of sin. And do not bring me into the hands of sin, nor in the hands of trials, nor the hands of degradation. And let the Good Inclination rule over me &amp; let not the Evil inclination rule over me. And save me from the Evil Inclination, &amp; from bad illnesses. And let not bad dreams or bad thoughts disturb me. And may my bed be complete before you. And enlighten my eyes lest I die in sleep. Blessed [are you L·rd] that enlightens the world all with His glory.

HEAR, O ISRAEL, Ado·nai Is Our G·D, Ado·nai Is ONE
(Silently) Blessed be His Name &amp; glorious sovereignty forever.
     And you shall love the L·rd, your G·d, with all your heart &amp; with all your soul &amp; with all your might. And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house &amp; when you walk by the way, when your lie down &amp; when you rise up. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, &amp; they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house &amp; upon your gates. (Devarim / Deut. 6:4-9)
And it shall be that if you hearken diligently unto My commandments which I command you today, to love the L·rd your G·d &amp; to serve Him with all your heart &amp; all your soul, then I will send rain for your land in its proper time, the autumn rain &amp; the spring rain, that you may gather in your grain, your wine &amp; your oil. And I will give grass in your field for your cattle &amp; you shall eat &amp; be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves lest your heart be deceived, &amp; you turn aside &amp; serve other gods &amp; bow to them. For then the L·rd's wrath will be kindled against you, &amp; He will close up the heavens that there be no rain, &amp; land shall not yield her produce, &amp; you shall perish quickly from off the goodly land which the L·rd gives you. You shall lay My words, these upon your heart &amp; upon your soul, &amp; you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, &amp; they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  And you shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down &amp; when you rise.  And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house &amp; upon your gates. So that the L·rd will lengthen your days &amp; the days of your children upon the land which the L·rd promised to give to your fathers, as the days of the heavens above the earth (Devarim / Deuteronomy 11:13-21)
And the L·rd spoke unto Moses, saying, speak unto the children of Israel &amp; say to them to make for themselves a fringe on the borders of their garments, throughout their generations. And they shall place upon the fringe of the border, a thread of blue wool. And it shall be to you a fringe that you may look upon, &amp; remember all the commandments of the L·rd &amp; to do them. Then shall you not stray after your heart &amp; your eyes whereafter you are wont to stray. So may you remember &amp; do all My commandments &amp; be holy for your G·d.  I am the L·rd your G·d who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your G·d; I am the L·rd your G·d.  (Bamidbar / Numbers 15:37-41) 
(Repeat &amp; Say) The L-rd, Your G-d is True.
The Pious shall Exult in Honor, let us sing upon our beds. The spears of G·d are in their throats &amp; a double edged sword is in their hands. 
Behold the bed of Solomon, sixty Strong men surrounded it – among the Strong Men of Israel. All of them were holding a sword. They were versed in warfare. A man his [sword's] sheath was on his thigh for the fear of the night. [3 times]
The L·rd will bless you &amp; protect you. L·rd will shine His countenance upon you &amp; give you grace. The L·rd will lift His countenance upon you &amp; place peace upon you. 
When you lie down, do not fear &amp; let your sleep be pleasant. Guard me as the pupil of You eye, in the shadow of Your wings guard me. And I will place my name on the Children of Israel &amp; I will bless them. I lied down &amp; I will sleep, awaken me for G·d, I rely upon You. In Your Hands I deposit my Soul. Redeem me, L·rd, G·d of Truth.<br><br>He who sits in the shelter of the Supreme One, in the Shadow of the L·rd will he dwell. I say to the L·rd "You are my refuge &amp; my fortress my L·rd, I will trust in Him" For He will save you from the ensnared trap from destructive pestilence. With his pinion will he cover you, &amp; under His wings you will be protected. Shield &amp; Armor are His truth. You shall not fear from terror of night, [nor] from the arrow that flies by day. From pestilence that walks in the dark, from a destroyer that damages? in the noon. A thousand will encamp at your [left] side &amp; ten-thousand by your right &amp; to you they will not come near. Only with your eyes you shall peer, &amp; the retribution of the wicked you shall see. Because [you said] "You, L·rd are my refuge" you made the Supreme G·d your abode. No evil shall befall you &amp; a plague will not arrive to your tent. For His angels He will command for you, to protect you in all your ways. On palms they will carry you, lest you stub your foot on a stone. Upon a lion &amp; a serpent you shall tread, you will trample a young lion &amp; a snake. Because he desired My Name - I will protect him &amp; I will lift him - for he knows My Name. He will call Me &amp; I will answer him - I am with him in distress &amp; I will release him &amp; Honor him I will satiate him with longevity of days &amp; I will demonstrate to him My salvation.

and [we have] Faith in all this – and it is established for us, for He is the L·rd Our G-d &amp; there is none other than Him – and we are Yisrael, His people. [He is] The One Who redeems us from the hand of kings, Our King, Who Delivers us from from the hands of all tyrants, the G-d that avenges for us those that cause us pain, the One that will pay back all that was bestowed upon us to all the enemies of our souls, the One Who keeps our souls alive, and did not allow our feet to stumble, the One Who guides us upon the altars of our enemies. And who raises our countenance [horn] upon all our foes, the G-d that takes vengeance upon Pharaoh, with signs and wonders – in the land of the people of H'am, the One that Strikes with His wrath all the first-born of Egypt, &amp; He Brings out His people, Yisrael from among them to eternal freedom. Who causes His children to pass between the splittings of the Sea of Reeds, &amp; their pursuers &amp; their foes He drowned in the depths. His children observed His might – &amp; gave praise &amp; lauded Him for His Name's sake – &amp; His Kingship, they willingly,  accepted upon themselves. Moshe / Moses &amp; the Children of Yisrael answered with Song &amp; great joy, &amp; they all said “Who is like You among the mighty,  L·rd. Who is like You supreme in holiness, [too] awesome [for] praises - Who does wonders.  Your Kingship, L·rd, our G-d Your Children saw by the Sea, united all of them gave thanks and accepted Your Kingship and said “The L·rd will reign, forever more.” And it is said “For the L·rd redeemed Yaakov / Jacob &amp; he saved him from the hand of one stronger than he.” (Jeremiah 31:10) Blessed are You L·rd, who redeems Yisrael.
Lay us down, our Father, in peace, &amp; raise us up, our King, for a good life &amp; peace. And spread upon us the shelter of Your peace, &amp; fix us, our King, with good advice before You. And deliver us speedily for the sake of Your name. And guard us, [upon saying "and spread upon us" stand and concentrate upon receiving the additional Neshama / soul] and spread upon us and upon Jerusalem your city your shelter of peace. Blessed is the One spreads the shelter of peace upon us and upon His entire people Israel and upon Jerusalem. Amen.
And the Children of Israel shall keep the Shabbat to observe the Shabbat in their generations – an eternal covenant. Between Me &amp; the Children of Israel, it is a sign forever, that in six days G·d created the Heaven &amp; the Earth &amp; on the Seventh Day He ceased work &amp; He Rested.

Exalted &amp; sanctified be His (G·d's) great Name. [cong. - Amen.] In this world that He created according to His will. May His Kingdom reign, &amp; may he cause His redemption to sprout &amp; may He hasten His Messiah. [cong. - Amen.] In your lifetime &amp; in your days, &amp; in the lifetime of the whole house of Israel, speedily &amp; soon; &amp; say ye, Amen. [cong. - Amen.] Be His great Name blessed forever &amp; throughout eternity. Blessed, lauded, glorified, exalted, extolled &amp; honored, uplifted &amp; supremely exalted, the Name of the Holy One, Blessed be He. [cong. - Amen.] Beyond all blessings, songs, praises &amp; consolations of this world to express; &amp; say ye, [cong. - Amen.]

Post Meal Blessing
















Blessed are You, L·rd, our G·d, King of the universe. The G·d, Who feeds us &amp; the entire world, with His Goodness, with Grace, with Kindness, with Abundance, &amp; with great Mercy. He Provides bread to all flesh – because forever is His kindness. (Psalms 136, 25) And with His great goodness, we continually never lack. And May You never let us lack food continually forever &amp; ever. For He is G·d, Who feeds &amp; provides livelihood to everyone. And His table is set for all. For He prepares sustenance &amp; food for all His creations that He created with His mercy &amp; great kindness. As it says “You Open Your Hand, &amp; You Satiate all the Living with its wants.” (Psalms 145, 16). Blessed are You, L·rd, our G·d, King of the universe Who feeds all.
We thank You, L·rd, our G·d, that You bequeathed to our Forefathers a desirable, good &amp; spacious land, a Covenant &amp; Torah, life &amp; food. And that You took us out from the land of Egypt &amp; that You redeemed us from the house of bondage. And upon the Your Covenant that you stamped upon our flesh. And for Your Torah that You taught us. And upon the laws of Your Will – that You taught us. And upon life, &amp; food that you feed &amp; sustain us. 
(On Hanukah &amp; Purim Al HaNissim is recited)...
Upon the miracles and upon the redemption and upon the mighty acts and for salvation and for the wonders and for the comfort that you did for our fathers  in those days at this period.
On Hanukkah continue: In the days of Matitya son of Yohanan, The high priest, The Hashmonay and his sons when the Wicked Greek empire arose Against your people Israel  To make them forget your Torah, and to remove them from the ordinances of your will and you with your great mercy you stood at the time of their suffering , you battle their battles, you judged their laws, you took vengeance upon their vengeance, you gave up over the mighty into the hands of the weak, and the masses in the hands of the few, and the impure Into the hands of the pure, and the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and the intentional sinners into the hands of those that are engaged in your Torah. To you you made your holy and great name In your world and for your people Israel you made a great salvation and deliverance as you do This day. And the afterwords your children came to the inner chambers of your house cleared your sanctuary and purify it your holy Temple and lit candles In your holy courtyard. And they fixed these eight days of Hanukkah – With complete praise and thanks, and you did for them miracles and wonders and we will thank Your great name, Forever.
On Purim Continue: In the days of Mordekhai &amp; Esther, in Shushan, the Capital (of Ancient Persia) – When Haman, the wicked,  stood against them, asking to destroy and kill and annihilate all the Jews – from the Youth to the Elderly, Baby &amp; Women – in a single day – on the 13th of the Twelfth month – which is the month of Adar – and to pillage and take booty and You with Your great mercy – You uprooted his advice &amp; confused his thought &amp; He returned to him his wiles upon his own head – and they hung him &amp; His children upon the gallows. And You did for them miracles and wonders - and we will thank Your great name, Forever.
And Upon all, L·rd, our G·d, do we thank You &amp; bless Your Name. As it says “And you shall eat &amp; be satiated &amp; you shall bless the L·rd, our G·d for the good land that He gave you.” Blessed are You, L·rd, for the land &amp; the food.
Have Mercy L·rd, our G·d upon us &amp; upon Israel Your people &amp; upon Jerusalem, Your city. And upon Mount Tzion – the Tabernacle of Your glory &amp; upon Your sanctuary. And upon Your Abode &amp; upon Your Inner Chamber. And upon the great &amp; holy abode upon which Your Name is called (Temple). Our father, Our Shepherd, Our Feeder, Our Sustainer, Our Provider. Our Deliverer. Deliver us speedily from all our  sufferings. And please, let us not need, L·rd, our G·d, from the hands [of others], gifts from flesh &amp; blood. And not from their hands – their loans – rather from Your hand – Full &amp; plentiful, rich &amp; open. May it be Your Will that we will not be embarrassed in this world &amp; we will not be denigrated in the next world. And upon the Kingship of the house of David Your Messiah - restore it in place speedily in our days.
 (On Shabbat we add : Retze: Desire &amp; Release … On Rosh Hodesh &amp; Festivals, &amp; Intermediate Holidays we add: Elo-keinu)
May it please You, L·rd our G·d,  to give us  Rest Hash·m, our G·d from your Commandments &amp; from the commandments of the Seventh day, this Great and Holy Shabbat day, for this day is a great and holy day before you. Let us rest on it and let us have serenity and have pleasure with your commandments – the decrees of Your will. And do not let there be pain and suffering on the day of our rest. And let us see the consolation of Zion speedily in our days. For you are the one that is the master of rest. And even though we ate and drank, the destruction of the of your great and holy house – we did not forget. Do not forget us forever and do not abandon us forever, for you are G-d, a Great and Holy King. 
(Rosh Hodesh, Intermed. days Passover &amp; Sukot say)
Our G·d, &amp; G·d of Our forefathers, may it rise, &amp; come, arrive, appear, find favor, &amp; be heard, &amp; be considered, &amp; be remembered &amp; our remembrance, &amp; the remembrance of our Patriarchs, &amp; the remembrance of Jerusalem, Your city, &amp; the remembrance of the Messiah, the son of David, Your servant, &amp; the remembrance of your entire People, the house of Israel before You – for deliverance, for good, for grace, for kindness, &amp; mercy, for a good life, and for peace on this day of

(Psalms 34:11) I was a youth &amp; I also became older, &amp; I did not see a Righteous person abandoned &amp; his children seeking bread.

And that that we left over, may it be for blessing. As it is written: As it is written: “and he  gave it [the food] before them and when they had eaten, they had some left over as [according to] the word of the L·rd. (II Kings 4:44 ) Blessed are you to the L·rd – Who makes the Heaven and Earth. Blessed is the man that will place trust in the L·rd. And the L·rd is his trust. (Jeremiah 17:7 ) The L·rd gives strength to His People. The L·rd will bless his people with peace. (Psalms 29:11) May He Who creates peace in His high places, may He with His mercy, make peace upon us &amp; all His people Israel, &amp; say ye, Amen.

The first night: And with the power of this commandment, may the internal supernal Kindness [<i>Chesed</i>], which is called, by day – the day that includes all days, which is Kindness within Kindness – be drawn from the supernal Mother to our mother, Rachel. And may our mother, Rachel, also receive the supernal kindness from all of the kindnesses of the surrounding light from the supernal holy Mother, which is Kindness within Kindness that is in Her. 
The second night: And with the power of this commandment, may the light surrounding the Kindness within Strength [<i>Gevurah</i>] be drawn from the supernal holy Mother to our mother, Rachel.
The third night: And with the power of this commandment, may the light surrounding the Kindness within Splendor [<i>Tiferet</i>] be drawn from the supernal holy Mother to our mother, Rachel.
The fourth night: And with the power of this commandment, may the light surrounding the Kindness within Eternity [<i>Netzach</i>] be drawn from the supernal holy Mother to our mother, Rachel.
The fifth night: And with the power of this commandment, may the light surrounding the Kindness within Majesty [<i>Hod</i>] be drawn from the supernal holy Mother to our mother, Rachel.
The sixth night: And with the power of this commandment, may the light surrounding the aggregate of the five kindnesses within the Foundation [<i>Yesod</i>] be drawn from the supernal holy Mother to our mother, Rachel.
The seventh night: And with the power of this commandment, may the light surrounding the aggregate of the five kindnesses within Kinghood [<i>Malkhut</i>] be drawn from the supernal holy Mother to our mother, Rachel.
So the throne has been established with Kindness, such that the strengths are sweetened and perfumed. And it is as it is stated: <i>and His right arm embraced me</i> (Song of Sons 2:6). And behold we are Israel, the children of kings, the children of Kinghood, Rachel the mainstay of the house – we have fulfilled sukkah like the commandment of the Lord our God, which corresponds to the clouds of glory, as it is written: <i> And the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day</i> (Numbers 10:34). And those are the seven clouds; corresponding to the seven days of the sukkah. And behold, we are sitting in the shade of the surrounding light which extends over it, which surrounds it and encircles it. And when we sit in it, may some of that surrounding light be drawn to us.

Blessing of the Trees









Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has not left out anything from His world and created good creatures and good trees to benefit the Children of Adam with them.
And after the blessing, one should say this request:
May it be Your will before You, Lord our God and God of our forefathers, that You should bring us up in joy to our land, and plant us within our boundaries. And there, let us fulfill the commandment of the priestly tithes and the [other] tithes, and all of the commandments that are dependent upon the land that You bequeathed to our forefathers - it is 'a land flowing with milk and honey'; 'a land with streams of water, springs and groundwater that emerge in valley and hill; a land of wheat and barley, and grapes and figs and pomegranates; a land of olives and honey' - as you have commanded us in Your Torah through Your servant, Moshe. Please, Lord, for the sake of Your great name, increase Your kindness with us and fulfill for us the thing that you promised us through Moshe, Your servant (Leviticus 26:4), "I will provide your rains in their proper time; the earth shall give forth its produce and the tree of the field shall give forth its produce. Threshing will overtake the grape harvest and the grape harvest overtake the planting, and you will eat your bread to satiation and you will live securely in your land." And fulfill with us the thing that you promised us through Isaiah, Your prophet (Isaiah 4:2), "On that day, the Lord’s radiance will lend beauty and glory; and the splendor of the land, dignity and majesty to the survivors of Israel." And it is stated (Isaiah 65:21), "They shall build houses and dwell in them, they shall plant vineyards and enjoy their fruit." And fulfill with us the thing that you promised us through Amos, Your prophet (Amos 9:13-14), "A time is coming, declares the Lord, when the plower shall meet the reaper, and the treader of grapes, the one who holds the [bag of] seed; when the mountains shall drip wine and all the hills shall wave [with grain]. I will restore My people Israel, they shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine; they shall till gardens and eat their fruits." And fulfill with us the thing that you promised us through Ezekiel, Your prophet (Ezekiel 47:12), "All kinds of trees for food will grow up on both banks of the stream; their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail; they will yield new fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the Temple; their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing."

And it should be erect lengthwise. Before he affixes it, he should recite the blessing:
For the sake of the Union of the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Divine Presence, with fear and love, and love and fear, to unite the name the Name of <i>Yod Hay</i> with <i>Vav Hay</i> in complete unity in the name of all Israel - behold I have come to fulfill the positive commandment from the Torah to affix a mezuzah, as it is written (Deuteronomy 6:19), "And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gates." May the pleasantness of my Master, our God, be upon us, and the work of our hands establish for us and the work of our hands may He establish.<br><b>Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to affix a mezuzah.

Fast Days and Mourning

Fast of Gedalya



Tenth of Tevet

<b>Penitential Prayers for the Tenth of Tevet</b>
After the repetition of the Amidah (standing prayer), we say the Confession and the Falling on the Face (<i>Nefillat Apayim</i>). And afterwards, we say:
And to the ground was my elevation brought down; my brokenness was enlarged. I sit in desolation on the day the Lion approached the deer, the holy mountain of Zion, my city. Hence I lament and mourn on the tenth month. On the tenth month, the Lion came up in anger, on the tenth of the month he built a wall against me. He approached, he and all of his nation, to take vengeance against me; and they set up a war with them. My lofty One and my Savior, make war against my enemy and my humiliator; make them drink a fully mixed cup (of poison), Lord, my Shephard, my Shield and the Horn of my salvation! 
On the tenth month, the enemy pursued me with a sword. On the tenth of the month, he prepared an ambush for me. And over this I lament, and my joy has waned. Woe to us, as the day is setting, for the shades of the evening are being cast. [May] the evening turn to morning, and the conspirators no longer rise high. Show grace to Your people, and spread a salve on their pain. Remember for me the covenant of the forefathers when I spread out the palms of my hands to You, 'Bringer of death and Giver of life; He who casts down to the grave and brings up.'
On the tenth month, the Coyote growls against my people. On the tenth of the month, he devoured all that came out from them. A Leopard is constant against their cities. They burnt down their cities with fire in the many calamities. Rise up, Lord, to desolate the wanton ones with Your power. They will be greatly shamed when You perform a goodly sign for us, Holy One of Israel, Lord of Hosts! 
On the tenth month, the hands of the enemy held a shield and armor. On the tenth of the month, like a man prepared for war against the 'faithful town.' Because of this, gentle community, gird sackcloth; remove your crown and cast it away; raise the dirge to the mountains. Your people calls out a dirge before You on this day, and our eyes flow with water upon the destruction of Your house. Arouse the day of vengeance against the enemies that roar in Your house! 'Let me know Your paths, Lord; teach me Your ways.'
On the tenth month, my oppressors raised an embankment against my city. On the tenth of the month, the ones who made my wound an inheritance surrounded me. 'My innards, my innards, I am shaken!' I am shaken on this day towards the One praised in the great council of the holy ones; I will beseech His presence to forego the rebellion and the guilt: Do not turn to our evil; erase the recorded sin; 'bring us back, Lord, to You and we shall return!'

Pirkei Avot

<b>Pirkei Avot (The Chapters of the Fathers)</b>
<b>Chapter 1</b>
<b>All of Israel</b> has a portion in the world to come. For it is written, "And your people, all of them are righteous, they shall inherit the land forever, a scion of My planting, the work of My hands in which I will glory" (Isaiah 60:21).
<b>1</b> Moshe received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Yehoshua, and Yehoshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly. They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment, raise up many disciples and make a fence for the Torah.
