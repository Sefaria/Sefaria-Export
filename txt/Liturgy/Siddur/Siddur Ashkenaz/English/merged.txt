Preparatory Prayers

Modeh Ani

I give thanks to You living and everlasting King for You have restored my soul with mercy. Great is Your faithfulness.
The beginning of wisdom is fear of Adonoy, good understanding to all who perform [His commandments], His praise endures forever. Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.

Netilat Yadayim

Blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word “blessed” is similar in concept to the words: “merciful” or “gracious” when applied to God. Just as merciful means that He is merciful, the source of mercy; so too, blessed means that He is the source of blessing.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> are You, Adonoy<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Generally speaking, the name Adonoy is understood as it is pronounced—Adonoy—my Master, and indicates His rule and providence of the universe. When reciting the Shema however, one should bear in mind the written character of the Name which indicates God’s everpresent existence. He was—is—and ever will be.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the washing of hands.

Asher Yatzar

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who formed man with wisdom<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This may mean either that man was formed by God’s wisdom, or that God formed man and endowed him with wisdom.</i> and created within him openings and hollows. It is obvious and known in the presence of Your glorious throne<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In refutation of those who claim that God is not concerned with earthly matters, we declare that even in the presence of His glorious throne, where He is surrounded by myriads of angels, He is aware of the mundane needs of each individual.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> that if one of them were ruptured, or if one of them were blocked, it would be impossible to exist and stand in Your Presence even for a short while. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who heals all flesh and performs wonders.

Elokai Neshama

My God! the soul which You bestowed in me is pure; You created it, You formed it, You breathed it into me and You preserve it within me. You will eventually take it from me, and restore it in me in the time to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This statement refers to the time when the dead will be resurrected.</i> So long as the soul is within me I give thanks to You, Adonoy my God,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it is said, “I will praise Adonoy with my life, I will sing to my God with my being” (Psalms 146:2).</i> and God of my fathers, Lord of all creatures, Master of all souls. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who restores souls to dead bodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to God’s restoring of the soul each morning following its departure while the person sleeps.</i>

Tzitzit

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the commandment of <i>tsitsit.</i>
May it be Your will Adonoy, my God, and God of my fathers, to consider [my fulfillment of] the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>tzitzis</i> before You as though I had fulfilled it in every detail, accurately and with full intent, and the 613<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The numerical value of the word צִיצִית is 600 which, with the 8 threads and 5 knots of the צִיצִית itself, makes 613, the exact number of the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah. This symbolizes the Talmudic statement (Maseches Nedarim 25a) that the wearing of <i>tzitzis</i> equals the observance of the whole Torah.</i> commandments that depend on it. Amein, Selah.

Torah Blessings

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The observance and fulfillment of His commandments makes a person holy.</i> us with His commandments and commanded us to be engrossed in the words of Torah.
Adonoy our God, please make the words of Your Torah pleasant in our mouths and in the mouths of Your people Israel. And may we and our descendants [and the descendants of our descendants] and the descendants of Your people the House of Israel, all  know Your Name and be students of Your Torah for its own sake. Blessed are You, Adonoy Who teaches Torah to His people, Israel. 
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe Who chose us from among all the peoples<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to God’s declaration, “And you will be a treasure unto me from among all people” (Exodus 19:6) which preceded the giving of the Torah at Sinai.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> and gave us His Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to the actual giving of the Torah at Sinai.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, Giver of the Torah!

Torah Study

May Adonoy bless you and guard you. May Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you. May Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:24.</i>
And they shall set My Name upon the Children of Israel, and I shall bless them.
These are precepts<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, Peah 1:1: Talmud Maseches Shabbos 127a.</i> for which no fixed measure is prescribed: [leaving] the corner [of a field unharvested],<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The unharvested produce was left for the poor; Leviticus 19:9.</i> [the offering of] the first fruits,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:9.</i> the appearance-offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">These offerings were brought when a Jew “appeared” before God in the Temple on the three Pilgrimage festivals—Pesach, Shavuos and Sukkos—Exodus 23:14-17, Deuteronomy 16:16-17.</i> [performing] deeds of kindness, and the study of Torah. These are precepts, the fruits of which man enjoys in this world, [while] the principal [reward] is preserved for him in the World-to-Come. They are: honoring father and mother, [performing] deeds of kindness, early attendance in the House of Study morning and evening, providing hospitality to guests, visiting the sick, participating in making a wedding, accompanying the dead [to the grave], concentrating on the meaning of prayers, making peace between fellow men and between husband and wife— and the study of Torah is equal to them all.

Tallit

My soul, bless Adonoy, Adonoy, my God, You are greatly exalted. With beauty and splendor are You clothed, enwrapped in light, garment-like; You spread out the heavens like a curtain.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 104:1,2.</i>
For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, with fear and love and love and fear, to unify the Name of <i>Yud Hei</i> with <i>Vav Hei</i> with a complete unity, in the name of all Israel. Behold, I am wrapping my body with <i>tsitsit</i> (fringes). So too may You wrap my soul – my 248 limbs and my 365 tendons – in the light of the <i>tsitsit</i>, [the letters, strings and knots of] which add up to 613. And in the same way that I cover myself with a prayer shawl in this world, so too may I merit to be in the section of the rabbis and to have a fine prayer shawl in the next world, in the Garden of Eden. And through the commandment of <i>tsitsit</i>, save my essence, my spirit, my soul and my prayer from [negative forces]. And may the prayer shawl spread its wings upon them to save them, ‘like an eagle that rouses his nestlings, hovering over his young.’ And may [this] commandment of <i>tsitsit</i> be considered before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if I fulfilled it in all of its details, all of its minutiae and all of its intentions – [as well as] the 613 commandments that are dependent upon it. Amen, Selah.
<i>Cover your head with the </i>tallis<i> and say:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to enwrap ourselves with <i>tzitzis.</i>
How precious is Your kindness, God; the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings. They will be filled from the abundance of Your House, and from the stream of Your delights You will give them to drink. For the source of life is with You, we shall see light in Your light. Extend Your kindness to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 36:8-11.</i>

Tefillin

For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, with fear and love and love and fear, to unify the Name of <i>Yud Hei</i> with <i>Vav Hei</i> with a complete unity, in the name of all Israel. Behold, in placing the <i>tefillin</i> [upon myself], I intend to fulfill the commandment of my Creator, Who commanded us to place <i>tefillin</i>; as it is written in His Torah (Deuteronomy 6:8), “Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead.” And they are four sections [from the Torah]: Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-8); And it shall be if you will truly listen (Deuteronomy 11:13-21); Sanctify (Exodus 13:1-10); And it shall be when He brings you (Exodus 12:11-17) – since within them they contain His unity and oneness in the world, may His name be blessed; and [through them,] we can remember His miracles and wonders when He took us out of Egypt, and that He has the power and control over the higher beings and the lower beings to do what He wants with them. And He commanded us to place it upon the arm in memory of the ‘extended forearm’ (with which He took us out of Egypt); and that it be across from the heart in order to subjugate the desire and thoughts of our heart for His service, may His name be blessed. And upon the head across from the brain, such that the soul in my brain – along with all my other senses and powers – be subjugated to His service, may His name be blessed. And may the bounty from the commandment of <i>tefillin</i> flow upon me, such that I should have long life, holy bounty, holy thoughts – free from any conjectures of sin or transgression – such that the evil impulse not seduce us or disturb us, but leave us to serve the Lord, as it is in our hearts. And may it be Your will before You, Lord our God and God of our fathers that [this] commandment of <i>tefillin</i> be considered before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if I fulfilled it in all of its details, all of its minutiae and all of its intentions – [as well as] the 613 commandments that are dependent upon it. Amen, Selah.
<i>Place the “tefillin of the arm” on the muscle of your left arm, and before tightening it, say:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to put on <i>tefillin.</i>
<i>Wrap the strap around your arm 7 times and then place the “tefillin of the head” on your head above the region between your eyes, and say:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us concerning the <i>mitzvoh</i> of <i>tefillin.</i>
<i>With the “tefillin of the head” in place, say:</i>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.
And may You impart from Your wisdom to me, God most high; and give me understanding from Your understanding. With Your lovingkindness, do great things with me. With Your merit, cut off my enemies and opponents. Pour bountiful oil upon the seven branches of the menorah, in order to cause goodness to flow to Your creatures. Open Your hand and fulfill the will of every living thing.
<i>When wrapping the strap around the middle finger of your left hand, say:</i>
And I will betrothe you to Me forever; and I will betrothe you to Me in righteousness, in justice, in kindliness and in mercy. And I will betrothe you to Me in faithfulness and you shall know Adonoy.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 2:21-22.</i>
<i>The following chapters, found in Exodus 13:1-16, are recited while wearing the tefillin, since they make direct reference to the mitzvah of tefillin.</i>
Adonoy spoke to Moses, saying: “Sanctify unto Me all the firstborn, whatsoever opens the womb among the Children of Israel, both of man and beast is Mine.” And Moses said to the people: “Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for with a strong hand Adonoy brought you out from here, and [therefore] you must not eat <i>chametz.</i> This day you are departing, in the month of springtime. And it will be when Adonoy will bring you to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall perform this service in this month. Seven days, you shall eat matzos, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival [dedicated] to Adonoy. Matzos shall be eaten during these seven days, and no <i>chametz</i> and no leaven shall be seen in your possession within all your boundaries. And you shall relate to your son on that day, saying: ‘Because of this Adonoy acted on my behalf when I came out of Egypt. And it shall be for a sign upon your arm<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the arm with the tallis or hand. Some then kiss the tallis or hand as an act of <i>chivuv mitzvah</i>, affection for the mitzvah.</i> and for a reminder between your eyes<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the head. See previous note.</i> so that Adonoy’s teaching will be [the words of] your mouth; for with a strong hand Adonoy brought you out of Egypt. And you shall keep this ordinance in its appointed time from year to year.
And it will be, when Adonoy will bring you to the land of the Canaanites as He swore unto you and to your fathers, and will have given it to you. Then you shall bring to Adonoy every one that opens the womb, and every firstling that is dropped by cattle that belong to you, the males shall belong to Adonoy, The firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you do not redeem it, then you must kill it by breaking its neck. You must redeem every firstborn of man among your children. And it will be when your son asks you in future times, saying: ‘What is this?’ You shall say to him: ‘With a strong hand Adonoy brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. And it was when Pharaoh unyieldingly refused to let us go, that Adonoy killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man, to the firstborn of beast; therefore I sacrifice to Adonoy all that opens the womb that are males, and every firstborn of my sons, I redeem.’ And it shall be a sign upon your arm,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the arm with the tallis or hand.

Ma Tovu

How good are your tents, Jacob: your dwelling places, Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 24:5. The Talmud (Maseches Sanhedrin 105a) relates that this verse contains Billam’s prophetic allusion to Jewish houses of study and worship.</i> As for me, through Your abundant kindness I will enter Your House; I will prostrate myself toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 5:8.</i> Adonoy, I love the Dwelling, Your House, and the place where Your glory resides.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 26:8.</i> I will prostrate myself, and bow, I will kneel<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These are three distinct degrees of worship, representing various levels of subjugation before God.</i> before Adonoy, my Maker.

Adon Olam

Master of the Universe Who reigned before any creature was created.
At the time when all was made by His will, then was His Name proclaimed King.
And after all things shall cease to be the Awesome One will reign alone.
He was, He is, and He shall be in glory.
He is One, and there is no second to compare to Him, to associate [with Him].
Without beginning, without end, power and dominion are His.
He is my God and my ever-living Redeemer, the Rock of my destiny on the day of distress.
He is my flag<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is to Him that I rally and through Him that I am identified.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> and my refuge; He is the portion of my cup on the day I call.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He answers me.</i>
Into His hand I entrust my spirit [both] when I sleep and when I awaken.
And with my spirit my body [too], Adonoy is with me, I shall not fear.

Yigdal

<i>This hymn, written by Daniel ben Yehuda, who was a Dayan in Rome about 1300, is based on Maimonides’ 13 principles of Judaism. According to Maimonides, failure to believe in a single one of these principles places one outside the pale of Judaism.</i>
<b>1) <i>the existence of God</i></b>
Exalted is the living God, and praised He exists, and His existence transcends time.
<b>2) <i>God is One</i></b>
He is One, and there is no unity like His, He is invisible, His unity is infinite.
<b>3) <i>God is incorporeal</i></b>
He is unlike the corporeal or even the non-corporeal,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God can also not be compared to the angels.</i> His holiness is beyond comparison.
<b>4) <i>God is Eternal</i></b>
He preceded every being that was created, He was First, and there was no genesis to His beginning.
<b>5) <i>God alone must be worshipped</i></b>
He is Master of the Universe to every creature, (all) proclaim His greatness and His majesty.
<b>6) <i>Truth of Divine Prophecy</i></b>
The fullness of His prophecy, He bestowed on those He treasured, and in whom He gloried.
<b>7) <i>Moses was the greatest of all prophets</i></b>
There never arose in Israel another like Moses, a prophet who beheld God’s image.
<b>8) <i>Divine revelation of the Torah</i></b>
The Torah of truth the Almighty gave to His people through His prophet, the trusted one of His house.
<b>9) <i>The Torah is immutable</i></b>
The Almighty will not exchange nor alter His Law. Never will He offer any alternative.
<b>10) <i>God knows the acts and thoughts of man</i></b>
He scrutinizes and knows our secrets. He beholds the end of a thing at its beginning.
<b>11) <i>Divine reward and punishment</i></b>
He rewards man with kindness according to his deeds. He sends evil to the wicked according to his wickedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word “deed” is not applied to the wicked man. Since Divine reward and punishment are distributed with kindness, reward is granted to man not only for his deed, which may itself be insignificant, but also for the long range effect of that deed. He is punished, however, only for his act of wickedness, not for the consequences of his deed.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i>
<b>12) <i>Belief in the coming of the Messiah</i></b>
He will send our Messiah at the end of days, to redeem all who await His final deliverance.
<b>13) <i>Divine resurrection of the dead</i></b>
The Almighty will revive the dead because of His abundant kindness: Blessed forever is His praised Name.

Akedah

Our God and God of our fathers, remember us favorably before You and be mindful of us for deliverance and compassion from the eternal high heavens. Remember in our behalf, Adonoy, our God: the love of our ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants; the covenant, the kindness, and the oath which You swore to our father Abraham on Mount Moriah, and the binding of Isaac, his son on the altar, as it is written in Your Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 22:1-19.</i>
After these events,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These events refer to the previous nine tests by which God tested Abraham. This was to be the tenth and the most difficult test of all.—<i>Ha’amek Dovor</i></i> God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” and he [Abraham] said, “Here I am.” He said, “Please, take your son, your only one,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was Abraham’s only son by Sarah.</i> whom you love—Isaac— and go to the land of Moriah, and bring him up as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will designate to you. Abraham awoke early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took his two attendants<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael and Eliezer.—<i>Rashi</i></i> with him, and also his son Isaac. He split the wood of the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went to the place that God had designated to him. On the third day, Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from afar. Abraham said to his attendants, You stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go to that place. We will prostrate ourselves [in worship] and return<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham unwittingly prophesied that both of them would return.—<i>Rashi</i></i> to you.” And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering and placed it on his son Isaac. In his hand he took the fire and the knife,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word is <i>ma’acheles</i> (root: אכל = to eat) which means that it renders meat fit for eating through slaughtering the animal. Another interpretation is: his knife is called <i>ma’acheles </i>because we still enjoy (eat) the reward of Abraham’s virtue when he agreed to use it to slaughter his son.—<i>Rashi</i></i> and they both went together. Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “Father,” and he said, “Here I am my son.” He said, “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?” Abraham said, God Himself will show the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went together.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although Isaac understood that he was going to be slaughtered, “They went together”—with like hearts.—<i>Rashi</i></i> They came to the place that God had designated to him, and Abraham built the<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah says that he built “the” altar not just “an” altar, to indicate that Abraham rebuilt the same altar which was originally built by Adam and used by Cain, Abel and by Noah.—<i>Targum Yonoson ben Uziel</i></i> altar there, and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac, and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood. Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. An angel of Adonoy called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham! Abraham!” and he said, “Here I am.” He [God] said, Do not harm the boy, nor do anything to him; for now I know that you are one who fears God and have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me.” Abraham raised his eyes and beheld a ram<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Tradition tells us that this ram was prepared for this purpose from the time of creation. Rashi (in Maseches Avos 5:6)</i> after it had been caught in the thicket by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and brought it up as a burnt-offering instead of his son. Abraham called the name of that place, Adonoy will see;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets the following: “God will see the binding of Isaac and through its merit He will pardon Israel every year and rescue them from trouble. It will thus be said, “On this day,” by all generations that the ashes of Isaac are seen by God and serve as our atonement.—<i>Rashi</i></i> as it is said [to] this day On Adonoy’s mountain, He will be seen. An angel of Adonoy called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said, ‘I have sworn by Myself,’ declares Adonoy, ‘that because you performed this deed, and did not withhold your only son, I will greatly bless you and make your descendants as numerous<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11 If these blessings were intended to increase the population of Abraham’s descendants, it was superfluous, since God had previously blessed him for that purpose. God here blessed the descendants of Abraham with the nobility of spirit and courage to fulfill the command to sanctify God even when self-sacrifice is required. Only the nation of Israel, Abraham’s children, were commanded to fulfill this mitzvoh, because of the legacy we inherited from him.—<i>Ha’amek Dovor.</i></i> as the stars of the sky and like the sand on the seashore, and your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies. All the nations of the world will be blessed Through your children, because you heeded My voice.’” Abraham returned to his attendants, and they rose and went together to Beer Sheva, and Abraham dwelt in Beer Sheva.
Master of the Universe! May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to recall for our sake the covenant of our fathers. Just as our father, Avraham suppressed his compassion for his only son and would have slaughtered him to do Your will, so may Your compassion suppress Your anger against us; and may Your compassion prevail over Your [other] attributes,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Hashem’s attribute of stern justice.</i> to deal with us more leniently than the letter of Your law. Deal with us, Adonoy, our God, kindly and with compassion. In Your great goodness, turn Your fierce anger away from Your people, and from Your city, from Your land, and from Your territorial heritage.

A person should always be in fear of God, privately as well as openly,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Some people conduct themselves in a God-fearing manner in the presence of others (in public), but in the privacy of their homes, do whatever they please. There are others who do just the opposite. In private they are governed by fear of God, but in the presence of others they are too embarrassed or intimidated to be God-fearing. A Jew must always fear God, in private as well as in public.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> [he should] admit the truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Acknowledging the truth is fundamental to serving God, and to all human behavior. One who is concerned merely with “winning the argument” will go to any extreme to come out on top. This attitude caused the downfall of the 250 leaders who joined Korach, rather than acknowledge the truth of Moses’ declaration (Numbers 16:2-35).—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> and speak truth in his heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is not sufficient to merely acknowledge the truth verbally but one must speak truth in his heart as well. Rashi on the Talmud (Maseches Makos 24a) cites the following incident as an example of how one should speak truth in his heart: A buyer once offered to purchase an article from Rav Safra while he was reciting the Shema. Because he could not indicate his acceptance, the anxious purchaser increased his offer. Rav Safra refused the increment because in his heart he had already accepted the original offer.</i> and rise early and proclaim:
Lord of all the worlds! Not on account of our righteousness do we offer our supplications before You, but on account of Your abundant mercy. What are we? What is our life? What are our acts of kindness? What is our righteousness? What is our deliverance?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Of ourselves or others.</i> What is our strength? What is our might? What can we say before You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nothing before You? Famous men as though they had never been?

<i>The Talmud (Maseches Menachos 110a) states: Rabbi Isaac asked, “Why does it say (Leviticus 6:18; 7:1) This is the </i>law<i> of the sin-offering, this is the </i>law<i> of the guilt-offering? To teach us that when one </i>studies<i> the </i>law<i> of the sin-offering, it is considered as though he had actually brought it on the Altar, and when one </i>studies<i> the </i>law<i> of the guilt-offering, it is as though he actually brought it on the Altar.” Rather than merely recite the following portions, study them and attempt to learn about the laws and significance of the various sacrifices.</i>
<small>(Exodus 30:17-21)</small><br>And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say: Make a copper laver and a copper base, for washing; and place it between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar, and put water in it. Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">His right hand was held above his right foot, the left hand above the left foot and all were washed simultaneously.—Maseches Zevachim 59</i> Upon entering the Tent of Meeting they will wash with water that they not die, or whenever they approach the Altar to serve, to burn a fire-offering to Adonoy. They will wash their hands and feet that they not die; and this is a perpetual statute for them, for him [Aaron], and his descendants for all their generations.

Terumat HaDeshen

<i>The following Scripture section describes the removal of the ashes which had accumulated on the Altar from the daily burnt-offering of the previous afternoon. This removal was performed prior to the daily morning burnt-offering. The passage below also describes the ritual of maintaining the wood pyres which were always burning on the Altar.</i>
<small>(Leviticus 6:1)</small><br>And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say: Command Aaron and his sons to say, this is the law of the burnt-offering. This is the burnt-offering [which must remain] on its pyre, upon the Altar all night, until morning, and the fire of the Altar will be kept burning on it. The Kohein will don his linen garment, and linen breeches upon his flesh, and he will remove the ashes when the fire consumes the burnt-offering on the Altar; and he will place them beside the Altar. He will remove his garments and don other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to an undefiled place. The fire upon the altar will be kept burning, it may not be extinguished. And the Kohein will burn wood on it every morning, and arrange on it the burnt-offering, and burn on it the fats of the peace-offerings. A constant fire will be kept burning on the Altar, it may not be extinguished.
<i>The </i>Tamid<i>-offerings, two daily offerings of one lamb at a time, were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The former was the first public-offering brought on the Altar each day. And the latter terminated the day’s offerings. These animals were purchased from the annual half-shekel gifts of the people and were offered on behalf of the entire Jewish People. Before reading this passage we offer a brief prayer.</i>

Korban HaTamid

<i>Some do not say the following prayer on Sabbath and Yom Tov.</i>
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, to have compassion on us, to forgive us all our sins, [done unknowingly], to atone all our iniquities, [done knowingly], to pardon all our [malicious] transgressions, and may You build the Holy Temple quickly, in our days, that we may offer, before You, the daily burnt-offering to atone for us, as You wrote for us in Your Torah by the hand of Moses, Your servant, from the mouth of Your Reverence, as it is said:
<small>(Bamidbar 28:1-8)</small><br>And Adonoy spoke to Moshe to say: Command the Children of Yisrael, and say to them: My offering, My food, to be consumed by My fires, a pleasing aroma to Me, You shall be diligent to bring unto Me, at its fixed time. And you will say to them: “This is the fire-offering that you will bring unto Adonoy: [male] lambs, in their first year, without blemish, two [of them] each day, as a constant burnt-offering. Offer one lamb in the morning, and the second lamb, offer in the afternoon. And a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a meal-offering, mixed with oil of crushed [olives] measuring one-fourth of a hin. [This is] a constant burnt-offering as offered at Mount Sinai for a pleasing aroma, a fire-offering to Adonoy. And its libation will be a fourth of a hin for the one lamb; in the Holy [Sanctuary] you will pour out a drink-offering of strong wine to Adonoy. And the second lamb you will offer in the afternoon; as the meal-offering of the morning [together] with its libation, you shall offer a fire-offering of pleasing aroma to Adonoy.
<small>(Leviticus 1:11)</small><br>And he will slaughter it on the north side of the Altar, before Adonoy; and Aaron’s sons, the Kohanim, will sprinkle its blood all around the Altar.
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, that this recitation be important, acceptable and desirable before You, as if we sacrificed the daily burnt-offering at its proper time, in its proper place and according to its laws.

Ketoret

You are Adonoy, our God, before Whom our fathers burned the incense of spices when the Holy Temple was standing, as You commanded them by the hand of Moses Your prophet, as it is written in Your Torah:
<small>(Exodus 30:34-36)</small><br>And Adonoy said to Moses, Take for yourself spices— stacte, onycha, and galbanum—<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Galbanum has an offensive odor. The Torah includes it among the other spices to teach us to include even Jewish sinners among the rest of Jewry at our assemblies of fasting and prayers.—<i>Rashi</i></i> spices, and pure frankincense, [they] shall be in equal weights. You will make it into incense, a compound mixed by a compounder, salted,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word, <i>memulach</i> is rendered by Onkelos as mixed, to indicate that the spices should be well mixed together.—<i>Rashi</i></i> undefiled, and holy. You will pulverize some of it very fine, and place it before the [Ark of] Testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This incense was offered each day upon the Innermost Altar which is inside the Tent of Meeting.—<i>Rashi</i></i> in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it will be to you holy of holies.” It is also written:
<small>(Exodus 30:7-8)</small><br>And Aaron shall burn incense of spices upon it [the Altar]  every morning; when he cleans the lamps he will burn it. And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon, he will burn it; a constant incense-offering before Adonoy throughout your generations.
<small>(Maseches Kreisos 6a; Jerusalem Talmud, Maseches Yoma 4:5)</small><br>The Rabbis taught: How was the incense compounded? Three hundred and sixty-eight <i>manim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>maneh</i> is a weight; plural, <i>manim</i>.</i> were comprised therein, three hundred and sixty-five corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, one <i>maneh</i> for each day— half in the morning and half in the afternoon. From the three remaining <i>manim</i> the Kohein Gadol brought two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies] on Yom Kippur; [for which purpose] they were put back into the mortar on the eve of Yom Kippur, and ground [again] very thoroughly, in order to make them very fine. Eleven kinds of spices were used for it. They were: 1) balm, 2) onycha, 3) galbanum, 4) frankincense— by weight, seventy <i>maneh</i> of each; 5) myrrh, 6) cassia, 7) spikenard and 8) saffron— in weight sixteen <i>maneh</i> of each; 9) twelve <i>maneh</i> of costus, 10) three of aromatic bark, and 11) nine of cinnamon. [Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine <i>kabin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kab</i> is a sixth of a <i>se’ah</i>.</i> of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three <i>s’in</i> and three <i>kabin</i>— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could use strong white wine— a fourth of a <i>kab</i> of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of <i>maaleh ashan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This herb causes the smoke of the burning incense to ascend in a straight line.</i> Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, Jordan amber was added of a minute quantity, and if one added honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Included are various sweeteners such as dates and other fruits.</i> it (the incense) became unfit; and if one omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The same is true if one were to add to the prescribed number of eleven spices.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The death penalty was given only if the Kohein Gadol actually entered the Holy of Holies with incense which was unfit. This was considered as an unwarranted entry into the Holy of Holies which carried the death decree.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: “The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. Why was the Carshina lye used? To refine the onycha in order to make it pleasant. Why was Cyprus wine used? The onycha was soaked in it to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10 This water came from a well named Raglayim.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i> was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Mei Raglayim</i> (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i>
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Rabbi Nosson says, While [the Kohein] ground [the incense] he would say, <i>‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,’</i> because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices. If half<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">184 <i>manim</i> instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared, it was acceptable; but we have not heard if only a third or a fourth [of it was prepared] <sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i> [whether it was acceptable].”
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>: Bar Kappara says, Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three <i>manim</i> from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i> the accumulated surplus was sufficient to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense.”] Bar Kappara also taught, If he would have put into it a minute quantity of honey, no one could have withstood [resisted] the scent. Why was no honey mixed with it? Because the Torah says, (<i>Leviticus</i> 2:11) For any leaven or honey, do not burn from them, [as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.
<i>Recite each of these verses three times:</i> Adonoy of Hosts is with us, a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob, Selah! Adonoy of Hosts, fortunate is the man who trusts in You. Adonoy, deliver [us]! The King will answer us on the day we call.
You are my shelter; from distress You preserve me; with glad song of rescue, You envelop me, Selah! Let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem, as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Order of the Temple Service

Baraita of Rabbi Yishmael

Rabbi Yishmael says: The Torah is expounded through thirteen methods:<br>1) A conclusion drawn from a minor or lenient law, to a major or more strict one.
2) A clarification based on identical words or terms in the Biblical text.
3) A principle derived from one Biblical text or from two Biblical texts.
4) A rule followed by a detail.
5) A detail followed by a rule.
6) A rule followed by a detail, which is in turn followed by a rule, may infer only what is similar to the detail.
7) When a general rule requires an explicit rule; when an explicit rule requires generalization.
8) Something included in a general rule, which was singled out to teach— was not singled out to teach about itself, but to teach (something new) concerning the rule as a whole.
9) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out in a case similar to its rule, —it was singled out to lessen not to increase the severity of the case.
10) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out in a case which is not similar to its rule, —it was singled out either to lessen or to increase the severity of the case.
11) Something that was included in a rule and was singled out for a new stipulation— does not revert to its rule unless Scripture restores it to its rule expressly.
12) A matter deduced from its context, or from a subsequent expression.
13) Also, two passages that contradict each other until a third passage reconciles them.
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers, that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days: and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years.

Kaddish DeRabbanan

<i>Kaddish is not the name generally given to this prayer in the Talmud. It is referred to there as “May His great Name...”, because the congregational response beginning with these words is the heart of this prayer. Only in one minor tractate, (Maseches Soferim 16, 19, and 21) is it referred to as Kaddish. Composed primarily in Aramaic, the language spoken and understood by most Jews in the Second Temple period (See Tosafos to Maseches Berachos 3a), nevertheless, several Hebrew phrases, which were familiar even to the unschooled, were also incorporated in the prayer. This particular form of Kaddish d’Rabanan, is so named because of the insertion of the paragraph which begins with the words “Upon Israel and upon our Sages, etc.” This Kaddish is recited following the study of Talmud or Midrash and invokes God’s blessings on the Sages of Jewry, the transmitters of the Oral Torah.</i>

Pesukei Dezimra

Introductory Psalm

<i>Psalm 30, once used to inaugurate the Holy Temple, is used today to inaugurate our daily prayers, for the synagogue is a “Holy Temple in miniature” and our prayers take the place of the sacrifices. It is both a prayer for success and a declaration of thanksgiving.</i>

Adonoy, my God, I cried out to You, and You healed me. Adonoy, You have raised my soul from the lower world. You have kept me alive, lest I descend to the Pit.

What gain is there in [the shedding of] my blood? In my going down to destruction? Will the dust acknowledge You? Will it proclaim Your truth?

<i>Psalm 100 was recited in the Temple only on those days when thank-offerings were offered on the Altar.

Yehi Chevod

<i>This prayer, mentioned in </i>Maseches Sof’rim<i> 17:11 is a collection of 18 verses from<i> Psalms, Chronicles,</i> and </i>Proverbs,<i> in which the Divine Name (הויה) is mentioned 18 times.

Ashrei

<i>Rav S.R. Hirsch writes that the six concluding chapters of the Book of Psalms are the most important gift of David’s Divinely-inspired hymns that Israel treasures so greatly. These six psalms, 145-150, are an essential component of our daily prayers. Our Sages attach much significance to Psalm 145 in particular, and stated: “Whoever recites ‘A praise by David’ three times a day is assuredly worthy of a share in the world to come” (</i>Maseches Berachos<i> 4b). When recited in prayer this psalm is always introduced with two verses from other Psalms (84:5 and 144:15). These verses contain the word fortunate three times, an allusion to this psalm being recited three times a day. These verses are so closely identified with Psalm 145 that it is commonly referred to as </i>Ashrei<i> (Fortunate).</i>
Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse referred to the Kohanim and the Levites who served (dwelt) in the Holy Temple (Your House); it is at all times applicable to scholars and devout men who study and pray in houses of worship and study.</i> may they continue to praise You, Selah.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 84:5.</i> Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 144:15.</i> A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rav S.R. Hirsch, David here declares, “I will dedicate myself to serve You and to fulfill Your will in loyal obedience,” for in serving God, man causes His Name to be blessed.</i> and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works, and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Not simply נפלאתיך—a report of Your wonders—but דברי נפלאתיך the “words”—the lessons that Your wonders teach.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">People in general will speak of God’s wondrous might in punishing the wicked (Sodom, Egypt, etc.) while David will proclaim that God’s greatness is measured more by His kindliness than by His awesomeness.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> will speak, and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and merciful,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He is gracious in bestowing reward and merciful in punishment.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Your works, which are the cause of your being thanked by sensitive people; similarly, cause your pious ones to bless You.—based on <i>S.R. Hirsch.</i></i> Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The penalties for transgressions are just, but God is gracious in the actual punishment inflicted on the sinner.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He is near to all who call upon Him, but His nearness can be perceived <i>only</i> by those who call upon Him in truth, who truly mean to have God enter into their lives.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> The will of those who fear Him, He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">While God <i>hears</i> all who cry unto Him in truth. He <i>answers</i> those who fear Him, who subject their desires to His will.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now forever. Praise God.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 115:18. You should pause between עולם and הללויה. Similarly, in all the <i>Psalms,</i> the word הללויה is not connected to the preceding verse.</i>

Psalm 146

Praise God! My soul, praise Adonoy. I will praise Adonoy with my life; I will sing to my God as long as I live. Do not place your trust [even] in noble men,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Sages, it is implied that one should not rely even on the merit of his sainted ancestors, the Patriarchs, for deliverance.</i> in man who has no [power of] deliverance. [When] his spirit departs, he returns to his earth;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Only the four cubits of ground which will receive him one day are <i>his;</i> of all the world they are the one possession which is guaranteed to him.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> on that day his plans come to naught. Fortunate [is he] when the Almighty of Jacob is his help,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob, more than anyone, sensed God’s nearness and protection throughout his difficult life and through all the trials to which he was subjected.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> whose expectation is on Adonoy, his God. He makes heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them; He keeps His promises faithfully forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">He alone has always proven dependable and faithful, for there are no limits to His essence and to His power.—<i>Ibn Ezra, Radak</i></i> He performs justice for the oppressed; He gives bread to the hungry; Adonoy releases the imprisoned. Adonoy gives sight to the blind; Adonoy straightens the bent. Adonoy loves the righteous. Adonoy protects strangers; the orphan and widow He enables to stand firm; and the way of the wicked He thwarts. Adonoy will reign forever; your God, Zion, throughout all generations. Praise God.

Psalm 147

Praise God! for it is good to sing to our God; for [His] praise is pleasant, befitting. The builder of Jerusalem is Adonoy; the banished ones of Israel He will gather. [He is] the Healer of the broken-hearted and [also] binds up their wounds.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Others render “their sorrows.” Both translations co-exist! God not only heals their physical pains but also abbreviates their sorrows as well.</i> He fixes the number of stars; He calls all of them by names.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Not one of the myriad stars was created accidentally; each has a unique purpose and function.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> Great is our Master and abundant in power; His understanding is beyond reckoning. Adonoy causes the humble to stand firm; He casts down the wicked to the ground. Cry out to Adonoy in thanksgiving; sing to our God with the harp.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Each musical instrument has its unique function. In the times of King David, the harp was used to arouse those who slept. The psalmist may be indicating that the harp arouses the sleeping soul of man to recognition of the miraculous ways in which God shows His Divine Providence for us every day.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> [He] Who covers the heaven with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth; Who causes grass to grow upon the hills. Who gives the animal its fodder; [also] to the young ravens which call. Not the power of the horse does He desire, nor the thighs of man does He want.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">God does not delight in those who place their trust in the strength of horses or in their own strength.—<i>Tzelosa d’Avrohom</i></i> Adonoy wants those who fear Him, those who hope for His kindliness. Jerusalem, praise Adonoy; Zion, extol your God.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalmist addresses the dwellers in Jerusalem and Zion, not the city itself.—<i>Tzelosa d’Avrohom</i></i> For He has fortified the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children in your midst. He established peace at your border; with prime wheat He satisfies you. He dispatches His command earthward; His word races swiftly. He provides snow like fleece, He scatters frost like ashes. He hurls His ice like crumbs; who can withstand His cold? He dispatches His word and melts them; He blows His wind, they flow as water. He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His laws to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is the receiver and preserver of God’s divine Law, the Torah, which includes <i>chukim, </i>statutes which confine the physical, sensual aspects of man within the bounds of moral purity, and also <i>mishpotim,</i> laws which govern communal life. Among the nations, law is determined by the views they hold at a given time and place concerning the needs of a society, and so their laws are based on expediency.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> He did not do so to any [other] nation; and of His laws they were not informed. Praise God.

<i>The following selected verses from </i>Psalms<i> mark the close of the individual books of </i>Psalms. Eitz Yoseif<i> notes that these verses may constitute a sort of blessing marking the close of the </i>Pesukei Dezimrah.<i></i>

Vayevarech David

<i>The following selections are additions to the </i>Pesukei Dezimrah.<i> The custom of reciting them is mentioned as early as the Gaonic era, specifically by Rav Amram Gaon. The first four verses (1 Chronicles 29:10-13) relate David’s blessing to God, when he presented the gold, silver, and jewels he amassed for the construction of the Holy Temple. It was a day of great rejoicing as, following David’s example, the leaders and princes also presented generous gifts for the construction of the Temple. These verses were incorporated into our daily prayers because they speak so eloquently of God’s majesty, and of the Divine providence which is the source of the power, riches, might, and honor of all human beings.</i>
<i>There is a custom that the following until אַתָּה הוּא יְהֹוָה הָאֱלֹהִים should be said standing.</i>
And David blessed Adonoy in the presence of all the assembly; and David said, Blessed are You, Adonoy, God of Israel, our father,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">David singles out Jacob because he was the first Patriarch to mention building a house of God (Genesis 28:22), “Then shall this stone which I have set for a pillar be God’s house.”—<i>Radak</i></i> forever and ever.

His might in war, his victories in battle, and the majesty of his kingdom, are all due to God’s providence.—<i>Iyun T’filah</i></i> for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours, Adonoy, is the kingdom and You are uplifted, [supreme] over all rulers. The riches and the honor come from You, and You rule over all; in Your hand are power and might, and [it is] in Your hand to bestow greatness and strength upon all.

Az Yashir

<i>In Temple times Shiras Hayam, the Song of the Sea, was sung by the Levites when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maseches Rosh Hashanah</i> 31a, mentions that the Ode was sung at </i>Minchah<i> on Shabbos.</i> After the destruction, the Jews of the Holy Land continued the tradition, reciting the Shira at the end of the </i>Pesukei Dezimrah.<i> The custom spread to Italy and from there to other Jewish communities. This daily recital is mentioned by Rav Saadya Gaon but not as an obligatory part of the service. Rambam calls it a “custom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchos Tefillah</i> 7:13.</i> Subsequently adopted by all communities, reciting the Shira became an integral part of our daily prayers.

Canaan “melted away” because they realized that Israel was destined to take their land, and their astrologers told them that there was no way out.—<i>Rabbeinu Bachya</i></i> Terror and dread fall upon them; at the greatness of Your arm they were still as stone; until Your people cross over, Adonoy, until [they] cross over,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The two crossings are the respective crossings of the Arnon and the Jordan rivers before entering the Promised Land.—<i>Onkelos</i></i> —the people You have acquired.

Adonoy! His sovereignty is established forever and to all eternity.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is a paraphrase of the previous verse as found in <i>Targum Onkelos.</i></i> When Pharaoh’s horses, with his chariots, and his horsemen, went into the sea, Adonoy turned back on them the waters of the sea; and the Children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 14:30-15:19.</i> For the kingship is Adonoy’s and He rules over nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 22:29. The word “king” signifies one whose leadership is accepted freely by all his subjects. Therefore, in reference to Israel who willingly accept the Kingship of God, it says, “For the kingship is Adonoy’s.” A “ruler,” however, is one who forcibly rules people, without their consent. Regarding the nations who do not willingly submit to Adonoy’s Kingship, the Psalmist says, “And He <i>rules</i> over nations.”<i>—Vilna Gaon</i></i> And deliverers will go up to Mount Zion to judge Mount Esau, and the kingdom will be Adonoy’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ovadyah 1:21.</i> And Adonoy will be King over the whole earth; on that day Adonoy will be One and His Name One.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Zecharyah 14:9.

<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i>
A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I have called to You, Adonoy. My Master, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If You God should take account of iniquities, my Master, who could survive? For with You is forgiveness, in order that You be feared. I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes; and for His word, I wait. My soul [waits] for my Master more than the watchman [waits] for the morning, [more than] the watchman [waits] for the morning. Wait, Israel, upon Adonoy, for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness, and with Him there is much redemption. And He will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.

Half Kaddish

<i>The Half-Kaddish is recited by the Chazzan. Here, as elsewhere in the Liturgy, the Half-Kaddish marks the end of a distinct section of the prayers, in this case, the </i>Pesukei Dezimrah.<i> It is called the Half-Kaddish, the final three verses of the complete Kaddish having been omitted.</i>

One should be very careful to emphasize the letter gimel (ג) when saying the word “Yisgadal (יִתְגַּדַּל),” in order that it not be heard as “Yis<i>k</i>adal (יִתְקַּדַל),” from the word קְדָל which means neck.—<i>Mishnah Berurah 56:2</i></i> be His great Name

Blessings of the Shema

Barchu

<i>It has become a universally-accepted custom to recite </i>Barechu<i> before proceeding to the blessings of </i>Shema. Barechu,<i> like </i>Kaddish<i> and </i>Kedushah,<i> cannot be recited unless a quorum—a </i>minyan<i> of ten adult males—is present. </i>Barechu<i> is also said by one who is called upon to read from the Torah. The practice of saying </i>Barechu<i> is mentioned numerous times in the Talmud. It is even cited in the Mishna (Maseches Berachos 49b) in the names of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael.</i>
<i>The Chazzan says:</i>
<b>Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.</b>
<i>The Congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</i>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever.
<i>The two blessings יוֹצֵר אוֹר “He Who forms light” and אַהֲבָה רַבָּה “Great love,” are referred to as the blessings preceding Shema (</i>Maseches Berachos<i> 11a). According to Rambam they were formulated by Ezra and his Court (</i>Laws of Shema<i> 1:7). You may not interrupt your prayers from this point on until after the </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i>. But you may answer “Amein” to the blessings of הָאֵל הַקָּדוֹשׁ “The holy Powerful One” and שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה “He Who heeds prayer;” say the thrice-repeated קָדוֹשׁ “Holy…” and בָּרוּךְ כְּבוֹד “Blessed is the glory…” of </i>Kedushah<i>; and answer </i>Barechu.<i> You may also answer אָמֵן יְהֵא שְׁמֵהּ רַבָּא “Amein, May His great Name,” when you hear Kaddish.” You may also answer Amein after the blessings of יוֹצֵר הַמְּאוֹרוֹת, “Who forms the luminaries,” and הַבּוֹחֵר בְּעַמּוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּאַהֲבָה, “Who chooses His people Israel with love.” For a more detailed exposition of these laws, see </i>Metsudah Kitzur Shulchan Aruch,<i> Vol. I, pp. 172-176.</i>

First Blessing before Shema

Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Former<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Forming, יוצר, is the act of refining or modifying an original substance, whereas, creating, בורא, refers to creating the original substance from nothing. For example, when one shapes a wooden table, to make it round, he “forms” the wood, the original substance which was “created.” Similarly, God “forms the light” which is His act of modifying or limiting the darkness He created.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> of light, Creator of darkness, Maker<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Making, עושה, is the act of completion, such as when one completes a table by painting it. Similarly, God’s finishing touch of creation is “making peace,” the vessel that holds it all together, as stated in the Mishna, “God found no vessel to contain blessing other than peace.” לא מצא הקב״ה כלי מחזיק ברכה אלא השלום—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> of peace, Creator<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Isaiah 45:7, on which this blessing is based concludes with the words, “and creates evil.” In His original creation, God created the potential for evil, which He constantly limits and controls as the Former and Maker.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> of all things.
He illuminates the earth [and provides light] for those who dwell on it, with compassion;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">God causes light to appear in stages, gradually. This is an act of great compassion for if He made it appear all at once, we would be overwhelmed and blinded by its brightness.— <i>Avudraham</i></i> and in His goodness renews every day, continually,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God is not a far-off observer of a mechanism which He created and ignores, but a Living Ruler, Who guides the universe and continually maintains it.</i> the work of creation. How many are Your works, Adonoy; You made them all with wisdom, the earth is full of Your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Lit., Your acquisitions: See Genesis 14:22.</i> The King Who alone is exalted from then,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., before Creation, See p. 9: God was King before all creatures were created.</i> Who is praised and glorified and uplifted, from the beginning of time.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., after Creation. Ever since Creation, God has been praised and glorified by His creatures.</i> Eternal God, in Your abundant mercy, have compassion on us, Master, Who is our strength, Rock, Who is our stronghold Shield, of our deliverance, [Be] a stronghold for us. The blessed Almighty, great in knowledge, prepared and made the rays of the sun. [The] Good [One] created [everything] for the glory of His Name:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Isaiah 43:7: “All that is called by My Name, I have created for My glory.”<i>—Avudraham</i></i> the luminaries He set around His strength (His throne). The chiefs of His hosts are holy beings,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Holy beings” are angels. In Hebrew, the word for angels means messenger, and includes all the instruments of Divine purpose, whether in human form, or in the forces of nature.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> the exalters of Shadai<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A name of God (Genesis 17:1; 35:11; 43:14, etc.) which refers to His setting boundaries and limits throughout creation.</i> continually recount the glory of the Almighty and His holiness. Be Blessed, Adonoy, our God, for the excellent works of Your hands,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Heavenly throne is thus conceived of as surrounded by angels and all the adoring heavenly bodies.—See Isaiah 6:12</i> and for the light-giving luminaries which You formed; they will glorify You forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Those of His creatures capable of praising Him do so. The rest are evidence of His astonishing wisdom and arouse the others to praise Him.</i>
Be blessed our Former,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Some render צורנו “our Rock.” The Gaon of Vilna, however, maintains that it refers to God as our Creator, thus describing Him in the tri-epochal aspect of His Unity: past, present, and future. He <i>was</i> our Creator, He <i>is</i> our King, and He <i>will</i> be our Redeemer.</i> our King, and our Redeemer—Creator of holy beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">These are the Jewish People, who are sanctified in body and soul. The word Creator implies a creation of real substance—the Jewish People rather than angels.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> Praised be Your Name forever, our King, Who forms ministering angels; and Whose ministering angels all stand at the height of the Universe, and proclaim with reverence, in unison aloud the words of the living God, King of the Universe. All of them are beloved,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beloved</i>—there is no envy, jealousy or rivalry among them. <i>Pure</i>—they have no selfish or ulterior motives; they serve God with all their being.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> all of them are pure, all of them are mighty and all of them perform with awe and reverence the will of their Possessor. And they all open their mouths in holiness and purity, with song and music, and they bless, and praise, and glorify, and revere, and sanctify, and proclaim the sovereignty of—
the Name of the Almighty, the King, the Great, the Mighty, the awesome One; holy<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the attributes we use to describe Him, He remains holy—beyond our conception.</i> is He. And they all take upon themselves the yoke<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The yoke of Divine Sovereignty is borne willingly and joyfully by each creature as an emblem of his free service to God.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> of Divine sovereignty one from the other, and give leave to one another<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">They take care not to precede one another in their praise of God. On the contrary, each says to the other, “You begin, because you are greater and more worthy than I.”—<i>Avos of R’ Nosson</i></i> to sanctify their Former in a spirit of serenity with clear speech and pleasantness,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The clear speech of the angels is the holy tongue (pure Hebrew).—<i>Ya’avetz</i></i> all exclaim Kedushah in unison and reverently exclaim:
Holy, holy, holy is Adonoy of Hosts, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:3. <i>Targum Yonoson</i> paraphrases this verse: “Holy [is God] in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His almighty power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity.” The Talmud, (<i>Masechcs Chulin</i> 91b) refers to this verse as the “Sanctification of the Angels.” According to <i>Avudraham</i> and <i>Ya’avetz;</i> this <i>Kedushah</i> has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that God relinquished His control over the heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently. We are therefore told that all the heavenly hosts proclaim God’s sanctification and dominion over all the universe.</i>
And the Ofanim<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ofanim, Chayos haKodesh,</i> and <i>Serafim</i> are various classes of Angels. <i>Ofanim</i> denotes animated wheels as conceived in association with the Heavenly throne. (<i>Avudraham</i>); <i>Chayos</i> are those angels who exist eternally (<i>Ya’avetz;</i> some angels exist only for short times for specific functions.) <i>Serafim</i> indicate “beings of fire.”</i> and the holy Chayos, with a mighty sound rise toward the Serafim. Facing them, they offer praise and say,
Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from His place.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 3:12. According to the <i>Kuzari,</i> God’s glory is a euphemism for God Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: God is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the <i>Kuzari</i> is that “God’s glory” includes the angels. His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called God’s glory, similar to a king’s retinue, which is his royal splendor.</i>
To the Blessed Almighty, they<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The angels.</i> offer pleasant melodies; to the King, the Almighty, [Who is] living and enduring, they utter hymns and make praises heard. For He alone is the Performer of mighty deeds, Maker of new things; Master of battles, Sower of acts of righteousness,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Pinchos ben Ya’ir was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchos ben Ya’ir planted the barley seed, and each year replanted the previous year’s harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchos told him, “Come I will show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” God does the same with the good and righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his reward, God returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends.—<i>Midrash Rabba, </i>Deuteronomy 3:6</i> Causer of deliverance to sprout forth; Creator of cures. Awesome in praise, Master of wonders, He renews in His goodness, each day, continuously,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since the blessing began with the praise of God as the Former of light Who continually renews the creation, it concludes on the same note.</i> the work of creation, as it is said: “[Give thanks to Him] Who makes the great luminaries,” for His kindness is everlasting.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 136:7.</i> Shine a new light upon Zion,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">We pray that we will be worthy of enjoying the original light of creation, which God put aside for the righteous in the future world.—<i>Ya’avetz</i></i> and may we all soon be privileged to [enjoy] its brightness. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Former of the luminaries.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—<i>Kuzari</i></i>

Second Blessing before Shema

<b>[With]</b> unbounded love You have loved us<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ אַהֲבָה רַבָּה, one should bear in mind that Hashem’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of Hashem’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called love.”</i> Adonoy, our God; [With] great and abundant pity<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden calf. He not only pardoned us, but gave us the Second Tablets and ordained the construction of the Tabernacle (Mishkan) for His Divine Presence to dwell among us.—Siach Yitzchak</i> have You pitied us. Our Father, our King! for the sake of our forefathers who trusted in You, and whom You taught statutes of life, so too, be gracious to us and teach us. Our Father, merciful Father, Who acts with compassion have compassion on us and put into our hearts to comprehend, and to be intellectually creative, to listen, to learn, and to teach, to preserve, to practice, and to fulfill<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">We preserve the Torah by not forgetting its teachings; we practice the commandments and we fulfill them by making them permanent parts of our lives.—Siach Yitzchak</i> all the words of instruction in Your Torah with love. And enlighten our eyes in Your Torah, and cause our hearts to hold fast to Your commandments, and unify<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Make us single-hearted and undivided in our love and reverence of Your Name. Keep us from distraction of personal thoughts and selfish motives.—Siach Yitzchak</i> our hearts to love and fear Your Name; and may we never be put to shame,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">When one has to receive a favor that is completely undeserved, he feels a sense of shame. We therefore pray to Hashem, that our redemption will not be a “hand out” without merit and cause us to be ashamed. We proclaim that since we “trusted in His Name” and accepted the bitterness of our exile, our deliverance is not totally undeserved.—Siach Yitzchak</i> for in Your holy, great, and awesome Name— have we trusted; may we exult and rejoice in Your deliverance. And bring us to peace from the four corners of the earth and lead us upright<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">May we return from our exile with our heads held high, not in meekness.—Siach Yitzchak</i> to our land.

Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who chooses His people Yisrael with love.

Shema

<i>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</i>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Israel: Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שמע and last letter of אחד arc written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to God’s oneness.—<i>Avudraham</i><br>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all of one’s thoughts on God’s oneness. The last word, אחד, “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that God, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Israel, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i>
<i>The following two lines are to be said silently:</i>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,׳ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Israel” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Jacob said, “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moses did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Jacob ordained it?” Thus, the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—<i>Maseches Pesachim</i> 56a.<br>When Moses went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise God by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say ברוך שם aloud.—<i>Midrash Rabba</i> to <i>Deuteronomy</i></i>
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages (<i>Sifrei</i> to Deuteronomy 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to God’s Law and make them instruments for His service.</i> and with all your soul<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved God with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.</i> and with all your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to God and to Torah might entail.</i> And these words which I command you today,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The teachings of the Torah should be ever fresh in your minds, as though you received it <i>today</i>.—<i>Ibid.</i></i> shall be upon your heart.

And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:5-9. This paragraph contains 10 commandments: 1) accepting the “yoke” of heaven; 2) proclaiming the Unity of God; 3) loving God; 4) studying Torah (and you shall speak of them); 5) teaching your children; 6-7) reciting Shema in the evening and in the morning; 8-9) putting on the <i>tefillin</i> of the hand and head; 10) putting up <i>mezuzos</i> on the door-posts.</i>

And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda bar Chaviva said that this third section was added to <i>Shema</i> because of six important things contained therein: 1. the commandment of fringes, 2. mention of the Exodus, 3. the call to assume the yoke of God׳s commandments, 4. the warning against heretical concepts, 5. the warning against straying after sinful desires, and 6. the warning against idolatrous worship.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 12b</i> to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations; and they will place with the fringes of each corner a thread of blue.

<i>You must be careful to connect the last words of Shema, ה’ אֱלֺקֵיכֶם (Adonoy, your God), with the word אמת (is true) without pause or interruption so that these three words form one sentence, meaning “Adonoy your God is true” (Maseches Berachos 13a).</i>

Adonoy, your God, is true.

Blessing after Shema

<i>The following prayer, which culminates with גָאַל יִשְׂרָאַל, Who redeemed Israel, constitutes the “Blessing after Shema” mentioned in the Talmud (Maseches Berachos 11a). It is also mentioned in </i>Maseches Tamid<i> (32b) as part of the morning service in the Temple.</i>
—and firm, certain and enduring, upright and faithful, beloved and cherished, desired and pleasant,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The Jew declares his commitment to God, and states that His precepts are not forced upon him. On the contrary, they are beloved, cherished, delightful and pleasant to him.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> awesome and mighty, correct<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The teachings of Torah are correct in their totality. They lack nothing and are eternally valid for all situations.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> and acceptable,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Even those precepts that are not easily understood and appear to contradict human nature, are accepted by us.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> good and beautiful is this<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">All that was affirmed above in Shema.</i> [affirmation] to us for all eternity. It is true, that the God of the Universe, is our King, the Stronghold of Jacob is the Shield of our deliverance. Throughout the generations He endures and His Name endures, and His throne is confirmed; and His sovereignty and His faithfulness endure forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">After having affirmed that all that was said in <i>Shema</i> is true, firm, certain, enduring, etc., we take an oath and testify that we accept the “yoke of heaven” upon ourselves as did our fathers before us and as will our children after us, forever and ever. Thus we say in the following prayer: “For our fathers, for us, for our children and for our descendants—Your word is good and lasting—a Law that will never be abrogated.”—<i>Kuzari</i></i> His words are alive and enduring, faithful and desirable forever and to all eternity; for our fathers and for us, for our children and for our generations, and for all generations of the seed of Israel, Your servants.
Upon the first and upon the last, [generations] [it is] a matter that is good and everlasting. It is true and faithful, a Law that will never be abrogated. Truly you Adonoy, are our God, and the God of our fathers, our King, the King of our fathers, our Redeemer, Redeemer of our fathers, our Former, Rock of our deliverance; our Liberator and our Saver which is Your Name from old, and there is no God besides You.
You have always been the Help<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>help</i> indicates that the recipient also participated in his rescue, whereas the words <i>shield</i> and <i>deliverer</i> indicate that the rescue was made without any help from the rescued party. Our fathers who were righteous, participated in their rescue, and God “helped” them. Since we are not that righteous, God shields and delivers us even though we have no merit.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> of our fathers; a Shield and a Deliverer to their children after them in every generation. The heights of the universe is Your habitation, and Your judgments and Your righteousness [reach] to the ends of the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively: “Affect mankind to the end of earthly time.”—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Fortunate is man who heeds Your commandments; and takes Your Torah and Your word to his heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Your Torah” means the basic concepts of the Torah itself, and “Your word” refers to ethical concepts, derived from events described in the Torah and by the Prophets.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> Truly, You are the Master of Your people and a mighty King to defend their cause. Truly, You are First and You are Last,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">We refer to God as First and Last only in order to preclude the notion that anything existed before Him, and to repudiate the idea that there is an end to His existence. We <i>do not</i> assert that He has a beginning or a fixed term.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> and we have no king, redeemer, or deliverer besides You. You redeemed us from Egypt. Adonoy, our God, You liberated us from the house of bondage. You slew all their firstborn, and You redeemed Your firstborn,.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 4:22.</i> You split the Sea of Reeds, and You drowned the wicked. You caused the beloved ones to pass through, while the waters covered their enemies; not one of them remained. Because of this, the beloved ones praised and exalted the Almighty; and the beloved ones offered hymns, songs, and praises, blessings and thanksgiving to the King, the Almighty, [Who is] living and enduring. (He is) exalted and uplifted, great and awesome; He humbles the haughty and raises the lowly.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">God humbled the Egyptians who were haughty and raised high the Jews who had been lowly captives in Egypt.</i> He frees the captives and redeems the humble, helps the impoverished,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">God also helps those who are spiritually impoverished.—<i>Rabbi Yehuda ben Yakar</i></i> and He answers His people when they cry out to Him.

Who is like You among the mighty, Adonoy! Who is like You— [You are] adorned in holiness, awesome in praise, performing wonders!
With a new song the redeemed people praised Your Name at the seashore! All of them gave thanks in unison and proclaimed Your sovereignty and said:
Adonoy will reign forever and ever.
Rock of Israel, arise to the aid of Israel, and liberate Judah and Israel as You promised.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">As it is said, “And a redeemer will come to Zion and to those of Jacob who repent of their transgression, said Adonoy” (Isaiah 59:20).</i> Our Redeemer— ‘Adonoy of hosts’ is His Name, the Holy One of Israel Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who redeemed<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">While God is always referred to as the Redeemer of Israel, this blessing utilizes the past tense, “Who redeemed Israel,” as it refers specifically to our redemption from Egypt.—<i>Tzelosa d’Avrohom</i><br>Our faith in the Redeemer of Israel, Who redeemed us from Egypt, and our hope that He will redeem us from exile, give us the spiritual energy and courage to stand before Him, to pray and beseech Him for our needs, as we proceed to the Amidah.—<i>Yesodos HaTefillah</i></i> Israel.

Amidah

Patriarchs

<i>Fundamentals of </i>Kuzari,<i> (Metsudah Publications, 1979) pages 269, 271, 273.<br>When reciting </i>Shemoneh Esrei,<i> you must adhere to these rules:<br>1. Before beginning the prayer, take three steps backwards and then return to your former position. Upon completing the prayer, take three steps backwards and return.<br>2. Keep your feet together.<br>3. Concentrate on the meaning of the words you are uttering. Remove all distracting thoughts and worries from your mind.<br>4. You may not interrupt </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> by talking, not even by answering Amein. If you should hear </i>Kedushah, Kaddish,<i> or </i>Barechu<i> while saying the </i>Shemoneh Esrei,<i> you should remain silent and listen to the Chazzan’s words.<br>5. At the beginning and end of the first blessing, at the beginning and end of the blessing that begins: “We are thankful to You,” (page 133) and ends with “The Beneficent is Your Name,” (page 140) we half-kneel and bow in the following manner: At the word “Blessed,” bend your knees; at the word “You,” bend forward until the vertebrae of your spinal cord are loosened; at “Adonoy,” return to your upright position in keeping with the verse, “Adonoy straightens the bent” (Psalms 146:8).<br>6. Each individual recites </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> in silence. Only the prayer leader, the </i>Chazzan,<i> ever recites it aloud, and then only after the entire congregation, himself included, has recited it silently.</i>
My Master,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When God’s name is spelled <i>Alef-Daled-Nun-Yud</i> it means “my Master”, i.e., it is a personal declaration of the person uttering it. When it is spelled <i>Yud-Hey-Vov-Hey,</i> it indicates God as the Creator of all.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 51:17.</i>
Blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The first blessing of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> contains <i>eighteen</i> expressions of praise which parallel the <i>Eighteen</i> Benedictions.</i> are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children’s children, for the sake of His Name, with love.
<i>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i> Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God.)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">We ask God for life so that we can fulfill His purpose in creating us, i.e., to observe and fulfill His commandments.</i>
<i>If you forgot to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing, you should recite it. If you have already said “Blessed are You Adonoy,” you must continue the prayers without saying “Remember.”</i>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God is a <i>helper</i> in all the fortunes of life by giving us the necessary energy and talents to succeed. He <i>delivers</i> us from both moral and physical suffering, and He <i>shields</i> us by keeping tragedy and evil influences from us.</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">These words complete the first blessing of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called “Avos” (Patriarchs). And here too we bend our knees and bow when saying, “Blessed are You.” The major theme of this section is to praise God as “the Great”, as manifested in the Divine protection and providence He gave to the Patriarchs, of whom Abraham was the first.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i>

Divine Might

You are mighty forever,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">God’s rule of the world is permanent and perpetual.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is the emphatic expression of our belief in the immortality of the soul.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> the Powerful One<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This passage begins the section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called “Gevuros” (Might) and its major theme is to praise God as “the Mighty One.” Who alone restores man to life, health, freedom, and well-being.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> to deliver us.
<i>From the Musaf of the first day of Pesach until the Musaf of Shemini Atzeres one should say:</i>
He causes the dew to descend.
<i>From the Musaf of </i>Shemini Atzeres<i> until the </i>Musaf<i> of the first day of Pesach you should say:</i>
Causer of the wind to blow and of the rain to fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God’s might is as much manifested in causing the rain as it is in reviving the dead. In fact the Talmud (Maseches Taanis 7a) declares in the name of Rabbi Avohu: “The day when rain falls is greater than the day of the resurrection of the dead.” Rabbi Yochanan said, (<i>Ibid,</i> 2a): “There are three 'keys' which God retains in His own hands and does not entrust to any emissary: the key to rain, the key to childbirth, and the key to the resurrection of the dead.”</i>
<i>If you neglected to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים, “the Resurrector of the dead,” you must say it at that time. If you reminded yourself after saying וְנֶאֱמָן אַתָּה “You are faithful,” you must repeat it and then complete the blessing of מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים. If you became aware of your omission after starting the blessing אַתָּה קָדוֹשׁ “You are holy,” even if you only said the word “You,” say the Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If during the first thirty days after </i>Shemini Atzeres<i> you are in doubt whether you said it, you must assume that you didnot say it. After thirty days, however, since you have become accustomed to saying it, you may assume that you recited the proper phrase and you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.</i>
Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The most extraordinary manifestation of God’s might—to our perception—is when He restores the dead to life. <i>Avudraham</i> writes that the three following praises represent various examples of how God restores life to those who arc near death. When a person falls (either physically or morally) he is often near death; thus, when God supports the fallen he restores their lives. When a person is sick, he often faces death, so when God heals the sick He restores their lives. A person who is imprisoned—i.e., confined—is like dead; thus when God releases the imprisoned He restores their lives.</i> with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Just as God shows His faithfulness to the living, so too will He keep faith with the dead who lie in the dust. Others say that “Those who sleep in the dust” refers to the Patriarchs; God will remember the oath He made to them and keep His promises to them.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deliverance will “grow” in stages rather than all at once.</i>
<i>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i> Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy)
<i>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning “Remember us for life.”</i>
And You are faithful<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">How remarkable is the Jew’s conviction of God’s faithfulness. When the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing of “Resurrector of the dead,” the Jew responds, “Amein” even though he has not seen God restore the dead to life; when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Redeemer of Israel,” he responds “Amein”, even though he has not yet been delivered; and when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Builder of Jerusalem,” he responds “Amein” even though Jerusalem has not yet been rebuilt.—<i>Midrash Tanchuma</i></i> to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.
<i>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei, the Kedushah is said here)</i>

Holiness of God

You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. For You are an Almighty King— great and holy.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty, the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing completes the section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called <i>Kedushah</i> (Holiness) which emphasizes that God is indeed awesome.</i>
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One.
<i>If you mistakenly said, “the Almighty” instead of “the King,” or if you are in doubt—if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), or if you had already started the next blessing, you must say the Shmoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you became aware of your error before that, you should immediately say “the King the Holy One” and continue your prayers.</i>

Kedushah

<i>The Congregation says and the Chazzan repeats:</i>
We will hallow Your Name in the world, as they hallow it in the heavens above, as is written by the hand of Your prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:3.</i> And they called one to another, and said:
<i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</i>
‘Holy, holy, holy, is Adonoy of Hosts, the fullness of all the earth is His glory.’”
<i>The Chazzan says:</i>
Those facing them say “Boruch...”
<i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</i>
Blessed is the glory of Adonoy from its place<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 3:12.</i>
<i>The Chazzan says:</i>
And in Your Holy Words it is written:
<i>Congregation says and Chazzan repeats:</i>
Adonoy will reign forever; Your God, Zion, throughout all generations! Praise God.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 146:10.</i>
<i>The Chazzan says:</i>
From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness, and to all eternity, we will sanctify Your holiness, and Your praise, our God, will not depart from our mouth forever and ever; because You are the Almighty Who is King; Great, and Holy. Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty, the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing completes the section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called <i>Kedushah</i> (Holiness) which emphasizes that God is indeed awesome.</i>

Knowledge

You favor man with perception<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing “You favor man with perception” begins the group of thirteen petitions which make up the “intermediate” section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> The first six petitions (blessings 4-9) are for our individual needs and well-being: understanding, repentance, forgiveness of sins, deliverance from trouble, from illness, and from want. Though these six petitions are of a personal nature, they voice the needs of all mankind. Note that the worshipper prays for his spiritual needs—knowledge, repentance, and forgiveness before he prays for his physical wants.</i> and teach mankind understanding. Grant us knowledge, understanding and intellect from You. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Grantor of perception.

Repentance

Cause us to return,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The goal of wisdom is the realization of man’s true relationship to his Maker. Wisdom should be used for Torah study and Divine service.</i> our Father, to Your Torah and bring us near, our King, to Your service; and bring us back in whole-hearted repentance<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Sages say, “Repent the day before you die” (Maseches Avos 2:10), and every day may be our last, we petition God daily for Divine guidance in repenting.</i> before You Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who desires penitence.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Repentance in Judaism implies regret for past misconduct and firm resolve for correct conduct in the future. God holds out His hand to the erring sinner and leads him back to righteousness, as the Talmud (Maseches Yoma 38b) declares, הבא ליטהר מסיעין אותו. God desires penitence as it is written, “I do not desire the death of the wicked: but (rather) that the wicked return from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11).</i>

Forgiveness

Pardon<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Sin can only be pardoned after repentance. Hence, the order of these two petitions. Even if a person was the worst of sinners, his supplication (after repentance) makes him fit to receive Divine mercy and helps him attain it—<i>R’ Yosef Albo</i></i> us, our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed;<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Error, חטא, is the result of carelessness, ignorance, or weakness; sin, פשע, is a deliberate disregard of moral or religious duty.</i> for You forgive and pardon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Gracious One, Who pardons abundantly.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">“Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity, his thoughts. Let him return to Adonoy and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God for He abundantly pardons” (Isaiah 55:7).</i>

Redemption

Look upon our affliction, and defend our cause: and redeem us speedily<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As an outgrowth of our penitence and our forgiveness we pray that we may be deemed worthy of Divine redemption.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> for the sake of Your Name; because You are a Mighty Redeemer. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Redeemer of Israel.
<i>(On Fast Days, the Chazzan says “Answer us” and concludes, “Blessed are ... Who responds at times of trouble.”)</i>

Healing

Heal us,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">After the petitions for our spiritual needs, we pray for earthly blessings—for health of body and soul, and for food to maintain our strength.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> Adonoy, and we will be healed, deliver us and we will be delivered; for You are our praise. Grant a complete healing to all our affliction
<i>If you wish to pray for the recovery of a sick person, you may do so here.</i>
<small>May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our fathers, that You send, quickly, a complete recovery from the heavens, healing for the soul, and healing for the body, for the ailing (<i>name</i>) son/daughter of (<i>mother’s name</i>) among the ailing of Israel.</small>
because You are the Almighty, King, Who is a faithful and merciful Healer. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Healer of the sick of His people Israel.

If you reminded yourself after concluding the blessing שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה, but before you started רְצֵה, “be pleased,” you may say: “bestow dew and rain,”וְתֵן טַל וּמָטָר and then continue with רְצֵה . If you remembered after that you must go back and say the 9th blessing, בָּרֵךְ עָלֵינוּ, and continue from there. But if you became aware of your omission after concluding the entire Shemoneh Esrei [and taking three steps backwards] you must repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei.</i>

Gathering the Exiles

Sound the great <i>shofar</i> for our liberty,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The following six benedictions, beginning with this one, are prayers for the restoration of the spiritual-national life of the Jewish People. This tenth benediction is an impassioned prayer for the fulfillment of the prophecy, “And it will come to pass on that day, the great Shofar will be sounded; and those who were lost in the land of Assyria shall come and those who were dispersed in the land of Egypt; and they will worship Adonoy on the Holy Mountain at Jerusalem (Isaiah 27:13).—<i>Avudraham</i></i> and raise a banner to gather our exiles, and gather us together from the four corners of the earth.

Justice

Blessed are You, Adonoy, King, Lover of righteousness and justice.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King of Justice.
<i>If you mistakenly said, “King, Lover of righteousness and justice,” instead of “the King of Justice” and became aware of your mistake within the time it takes to utter the three word greeting (Sholom Aleichem Rebbe), you should immediately say “the King of Justice.” If you remembered after that interval, you may continue the Shemoneh Esrei since the word “King” was mentioned in the regular blessing.</i>

Against Enemies

Let there be no hope for informers <sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This petition was added to the original Eighteen Benedictions. It was ordained by Rabban Gamliel and his <i>Bais Din</i> in Yavneh, according to the text of Shmuel HaKattan, its author (Maseches Berachos 28:b).

The Righteous

May Your mercy be aroused, Adonoy our God, upon the righteous,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer for the righteous follows the prayer against the wicked, following the same sequence of the Psalmist’s verse, “And all the pride of the wicked, I shall cut down; exalted will be the pride of the righteous” (75:11).—Talmud, <i>Maseches Megillah</i> 17b</i> upon the pious, upon the elders of Your people, Israel, upon the remnant of their scholars, upon the true proselytes and upon us.

Speedily cause the sprout of David,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer for the Messiah, descendant of David, follows the prayer for Jerusalem, following the sequence of Hosea’s prophecy (3:5), “Afterward, the Children of Israel will return to Jerusalem and seek Adonoy their God, and David their King “—<i>Masechcas Megillah</i> 18a</i> Your servant,  to flourish and exalt his power with Your deliverance. We hope all day for Your deliverance. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who causes the power of salvation to sprout.

Response to Prayer

Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The last of the intermediate benedictions petitions God to answer all our preceding prayers.</i> spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers compassionately and willingly, for You are Almighty Who hears prayers and supplications; and do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence, our King,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">At this point, the worshiper may add any private petition, and ask God’s help for himself, for his household, or for his community.</i> for You hear the prayers of Your people, Israel, with compassion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who hears prayers.

Temple Service

Be pleased,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The three concluding benedictions are known as the benedictions of thanksgiving. They consist of prayers for the re-establishment of God’s service at Jerusalem; thanksgiving for God’s daily wonders in our behalf; and a prayer for peace and prosperity.</i> Adonoy, our God, with Your people, Israel, and their prayer;<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous blessings the first person was used: “Heal us,” “Have mercy on us,” whereas here the third person is used: “Their prayer,” “Accept their prayer.” In order to achieve a level in which we will be a source of pleasure to God, we must possess greater merit than what we as individuals can claim. We therefore ask God to take pleasure in the entire people of Israel among whom there are pious and righteous individuals who possess great merit, and we ask Him to accept “their prayer” with love and satisfaction.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer “Be pleased” in a different form was recited by the <i>Kohanim</i> (priests) every day following the morning fire-offering.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11b</i> of Israel; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Israel.
<i>On regular weekdays continue, “And may our eyes”. On Rosh Chodesh and on Chol HaMoed, the following prayer is added:</i> 
Our God and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of David, Your servant; the remembrance of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Israel, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for life and peace on this day of the: <i>Rosh Chodesh/Festival of Matzos/Festival of Sukkos</i>. Remember us Adonoy, our God, on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for our eyes are directed to You, because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
<i>If you forgot to say this at Shacharis, (the Morning Service) or at Mincha (the Afternoon Service), but realized your omission before saying מוֹדִים, “We are thankful,” you should say it at that time and continue with מוֹדִים. If you became aware of your omission after saying “מוֹדִים” “We are thankful,” but before concluding the Shemoneh Esrei [and taking three steps backwards], start again from רְצֵה, “Be pleased.” If you had completed the Shemoneh Esrei and then remembered, you must repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you are in doubt, follow the same procedure as above. If you had already said the Musaf prayer and recalled your omission, it is the opinion of some authorities, that the<i> Shemoneh Esrei</i> of </i>Shacharis<i> be repeated as a נְדָבָה, a free-will-offering of prayer, rather than an obligatory prayer.</i>
And may our eyes behold<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">We pray for the privilege of witnessing the visible revelation of the Divine Presence as it appeared to the prophets, to the pious, and to all who were delivered from Egypt.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> Your merciful return to Zion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.

Thanksgiving

<i>At the words, </i>We are thankful,<i> bend forward; at </i>Adonoy<i> return to an upright position.</i>
We are thankful to You<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Here you should bow in gratitude, as if standing before the Divine Presence, and say, “We are thankful to You.” The Jews always bowed when they perceived the Divine Presence..—<i>Kuzari</i></i> that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, You are the Shield of our deliverance  in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Here we thank God for returning our souls each morning, after having “entrusted” them to Him all night.—<i>Eitz Yosef</i></i> and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase concludes the earlier declaration, “We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise ... evening, morning, and noon .”—<i>Iyun Tefillalh</i></i> (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You.
<i>(When the Chazzan repeats the </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was ordained by Rav and his colleagues. It is an abstract of several prayers recited by various Rabbis [<i>=Rabanan</i>], and for this reason it is called </i>Modim D’Rabanan.<i></i>)</i>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due.
<i>(On Chanukah and Purim the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, “וְעַל כֻּלָּם, and for all the foregoing.”)</i>
[We thank You] for the miracles, for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
<i>On Chanukah:</i> In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to rationally conceived laws. S.R. Hirsch comments: The Greeks knew that the key to the Jewish religion is the Torah. If Torah were forgotten, the decline of ritual observance would be inevitable and rapid. Thus, they concentrated first on causing Torah to be forgotten, knowing that the deterioration of religious observance would swiftly follow.</i> and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<i>On Purim:</i> In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The usual procedure of those times was that all the wealth of executed people reverted to the monarch. In contrast to the norm, Haman decreed that Jewish possessions would be free for all to enjoy. He did this to provide added incentive to the populace who might have hesitated to kill Jews if they had nothing to gain.</i>— And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows. And You made a miracle and a wonder for them, and we are thankful to Your great name forever.  
And for all the foregoing may Your Name, our King, constantly be blessed and extolled, forever and ever.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</i> Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.
<i>If you forget to say this, you need not go back and repeat it. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity — the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy; Your Name is The Beneficent and You it is fitting to praise.

Birkat Kohanim

<i>In Leviticus 9:22, we find that after he completed the Divine offering, Aaron lifted up his hands and blessed the people. In a like manner, his descendants, the </i>Kohanim,<i> uttered the priestly blessing after performing the Temple Service. In our days, on the occasions when the </i>kohanim<i> recite the priestly blessings, they do so immediately after the “We are thankful” prayer which terminates the </i>Avodah<i> (Service) section of the </i>Shemoneh Esrei.<i> When </i>Kohanim<i> do not recite the blessings, the blessings are mentioned by the </i>Chazzan<i> in his repetition of the </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i>.—<i>Avudraham</i></i>
<i>To be said by the Chazzan</i>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing of the Torah, written by the hand of Moses, Your servant, pronounced from the mouth of Aaron and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people; as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you and grant you peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i> paraphrases this blessing with the words יכבש כעסו, “May He withhold His anger.”</i>

Peace

Grant peace,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>Birkat Kohanim</i> concludes with a blessing for peace, this concluding blessing is a restatement of the last benediction in the form of a congregational prayer.—<i>Pesher Dovor</i></i> goodness, and blessing, favor, kindness and compassion upon us and upon all Israel, Your people. Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance. For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonoy our God, a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">One of the most important <i>mitzvos</i> of the “Torah of Life” is the mitzvah of doing kindness. But it is incomplete unless there is a love of kindliness in the heart which precedes the act of kindliness.—<i>Pesher Dovor</i></i> righteousness, blessing, compassion, life and peace. And may it be good in Your sight to bless Your people, Israel, at all times and at every moment with Your peace.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</i> May we be remembered and inscribed before You in the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance; we and all Your people, the House of Israel, for a good life and peace.
<i>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who blesses His people Israel with peace.

Concluding Passage

May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be acceptable before You, Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was the personal meditation of Mar the son of Ravina, which he recited after he completed his prayers (Maseches Berachos 17a), and it is therefore expressed in the singular. The Jew prays that his mouth, his tongue, and his lips, which have just served as the instruments for his communion with God, will not forfeit any of their moral purity in his dealings with his fellow men<i>—Yaavetz</i></i> and my lips from speaking deceitfully. May my soul be unresponsive to those who curse me; and let my soul be like dust to all. Open my heart to Your Torah and let my soul pursue Your commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">May I have an open, receptive and understanding mind and spirit in the study of Torah. When it comes to <i>mitzvos,</i> let my soul know no indifference, indolence, or passivity.

Hirsch</i></i> And all who plan evil against me, quickly annul their counsel and frustrate their intention. Act for the sake of Your Name. Act for the sake of Your right hand.

May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be acceptable before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens may He make peace upon us and upon all Israel and say Amein.
May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant us our share in Your Torah. And there we will serve You reverently as in the days of old, and in earlier years. And let Adonoy be pleased with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem as in the days of old and in earlier years.
<i>On Rosh Chodesh, Chol HaMoed, and Chanukah, Hallel is recited. On Fast Days (Monday—Thursday—Monday, Tenth of Teves, Fast of Esther, Seventeenth of Tamuz) </i>Selichos<i> are recited. On days when </i>Tachanun<i> is omitted (see below) the chazzan continues with Half Kaddish. (14 and 15 Adar Rishon in a leap year); the entire month of Nissan; Pesach Sheini (14 Iyar); Lag BaOmer; 1-8 Sivan; 9 and 15 Av; and 29 Elul. When </i>Tachanun<i> is omitted on these days, it is also omitted at the preceding Mincha (afternoon service). </i>Tachanun<i> is also omitted in the presence of a bridegroom, in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, and on the occasion of a circumcision if the father, the </i>sandak<i> or the </i>mohel<i> is present.</i>

Post Amidah

Vidui and 13 Middot

<i>The worshipper recites the </i>Tachanun<i> in a sitting position, while resting his brow on his arm. During the morning service, when the hand-</i>tefillin<i> is on the left arm, he leans his brow on his right arm, but at the Mincha service he leans his brow on his left arm. This “falling on one’s face” symbolizes complete submission to God and the committing of our destinies into His hands. It is mentioned in the Talmud (Maseches Megillah 22b), and originates with Moses, who “Fell down before God” (Deuteronomy 9:18) and was followed by Joshua, who “Fell on the earth upon his face before the Ark of God” (Joshua 7:6)</i>
Our God and God of our fathers, let our prayer come before you and do not ignore our supplication. For we are not so brazen-faced and stiff-necked to say to you, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, We are righteous and have not sined. But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt]; We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us]; We have stolen; We have slandered. We have caused others to sin; We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked; We have sinned with malicious intent; We have forcibly taken other’s possessions even though we paid for them; We have added falsehood upon falsehood; we have joined with evil individuals or groups. We have given harmful advice; We have deceived; We have mocked; We have rebelled against God and His Torah; We have caused God to be angry with us; We have turned away from God’s Torah; We have sinned deliberately; We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments; We have caused our friends grief; We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins. We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע [raising a hand to hit someone]. We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption; We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations; We have gone astray; We have led others astray.
We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your good laws, and we have gained nothing from it. And You are the Righteous One in all [punishment] that has come upon us; for You have acted truthfully and we have acted wickedly.
You are Almighty, Slow to anger; You are called the Lord of Mercy, and You have taught us the way of repentance. Remember the greatness of Your mercy and kindness, this day and every day, for the descendants of Your loved ones. Turn to us with compassion for You are the Lord of Mercy. We approach Your Presence with supplication and prayer, as You made known to [Moses,] the modest one of old. Turn from Your fierce anger, as it is written in Your Torah: May we be sheltered and lodged in the shadow of Your wings, as on the day [of which it is said:] When Adonoy descended in the cloud. Remove [our] transgression, and blot out [our] iniquity, as on the day [of which it is said:] And He stood with him there. Give ear to our cry and listen to our speech, as on the day [of which it is said:] And He proclaimed in the Name, Adonoy And there it is said:
<i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses] and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy, Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Kindness and Truth. Keeper of kindness for thousands of generations, Endurer of iniquity and transgression, and sin, and Acquitter of those who repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:5-7.</i>
And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i> Pardon us, our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed. For You, my Master, are good and forgiving, and abounding in kindness to all who call upon You.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 86:5.</i>

Avinu Malkenu

<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, </i>Avinu Malkeinu<i> is recited here during </i>Shacharis<i>—the morning service, and </i>Mincha<i>—the afternoon service. It is also said by some congregations on public Fast Days. The number of petitions in this prayer varies with custom, but in our rite, </i>Avinu Malkeinu<i> consists of 44 petitions. Since many of them are similar to the petitions of </i>Shemoneh Esrei, Avinu Malkeinu<i> is never recited on Shabbos, when the petitions of </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> are also omitted. This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (Maseches Taanis 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, “Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us,” and rain fell.</i>
Our Father, our King!<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as God’s slaves (Leviticus 25:42), and as His children (Deuteronomy 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King Contrary to the view that God, the Father, is so full of love for His children, that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that God the King, must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to God—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!</i> we have sinned before You.
Our Father our King! we have no King except You.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Despite our physical banishment and spiritual estrangement—the result of our sins—we still have none other than God to guide our lives and to shape our destiny.</i>

Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is, having watched while others sin, when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say כל ישראל ערבין זה לזה. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask God to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor.

<i>The following prayers are added on Mondays and Thursday. On other days, continue “Guardian of Israel. . .”:</i>

Tachanun

For Monday and Thursday

<i>This group of somber plaints, known as the “long </i>Vehu Rachum<i>” is recited in the morning service on Mondays and Thursdays, except on days when </i>Tachanun<i> is omitted. The origin of these seven prayers is shrouded in legend. It has been suggested that they were composed during the terrible persecutions at the hands of the Goths in seventh-century Spain. It has been said, “Whoever can read this ‘long </i>Vehu Rachum<i>’ prayer without emotion has lost all feeling for what is great and noble.” Despite all the repetition in these cries for forgiveness, mercy, help, and protection, the effect is not tiring; because here it is not merely an individual soul, but the soul of an entire people that utters these laments and supplications, that gives voice to this woe of nearly two thousand years. Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the Second Tablets on the fifth day of the week, and he returned to the people on the second day of the week, bringing them the new tablets as a security for the Divine covenant and as confirmation of God’s atonement for their transgression. Ever since, the second and fifth day of each week, Monday and Thursday, have been days of summons to the Jewish people to assemble anew before God and to reaffirm their sincere “return” to the Law of God. Our regular service is therefore augmented on these days by these additional supplications.</i>
And He, the merciful One, will atone iniquity, and will not destroy, He frequently withdraws His anger, and does not arouse all His rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 78:38.</i> You, Adonoy, do not withhold Your mercy from us; may Your kindness and truth always protect us.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 40:12 (basis).</i> Deliver us, Adonoy, our God, and gather us from among the nations to give thanks to Your holy Name to be extolled in Your praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 106:47.</i> If You, God, should preserve iniquities,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Were it not for the grace of God, any sin a person committed would deprive him of the right to continued existence.

Nefilat Apayim

David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hands of Adonoy, for His compassion is great; and let me not fall into the hands of men.”
Merciful and Gracious One, I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications: Adonoy, do not punish me in anger, do not chastise me in fury. Have mercy on me, Adonoy, for I languish; heal me, Adonoy, for my bones shake with terror. My whole being is stricken with terror, while You, Adonoy —O, how long! Adonoy, turn! Rescue me! Deliver me as befits Your faithfulness. For there is no praise of You among the dead; in Sheol, who can acclaim You? I am weary with groaning; every night I drench my bed, I melt my couch in tears. My eyes are wasted by vexation, worn out because of all my foes. Away from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy heeds the sound of my weeping. Adonoy heeds my plea, Adonoy accepts my prayer. All my enemies will be frustrated and stricken with terror; they will turn back in an instant, frustrated.

Torah Reading

Removing the Torah from Ark

El Erech Appayim

<i>The following paragraph is said on Mondays and Thursdays except on Rosh Chodesh, the eve of Pesach, Tishah b’Av, Chanukah, the 14th and 15th Adar and Adar Sheni (Purim and Purim Katan), the eve of Yom Kippur, and it is also omitted in the house of a mourner. This prayer is recited while standing, as it includes a form of viduy (</i>confession<i>) which must be said while standing. On Mondays and Thursdays, as we are about to open the Ark to take out the Seifer Torah for public reading, we realize that we have transgressed much that is written in the Torah and are unworthy even to take it into our hands. Aware of our inadequacy and unworthiness, we utter the words, “Almighty who is slow to anger etc....”, appealing to Him for forgiveness.</i>
Almighty who is slow to anger and of great kindness and truth, do not rebuke us in Your anger. Adonoy, spare Your people<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse from Joel (2:17) was inserted here by the sages of Italy as an abbreviated form of <i>Tachanun</i> to be recited by latecomers to the synagogue, instead of the entire “<i>Vehu Rachum</i>”, so that they could pay attention to the reading of the Torah.</i> and deliver us from all evil. We have sinned against You, Master, forgive us, please, in keeping with Your abundant mercy, Almighty.

Vayehi Binsoa

<i>Moses and the Elders with him ordained that the Torah be read in public on Shabbos, Monday and Thursday mornings. The Talmud (Maseches Baba Kama 82), notes that Ezra later instituted that three men should be called up to read a total of at least ten verses from the Torah. He also enacted that the Torah be read at the Shabbos Mincha (afternoon) service. When the Torah is removed from the Ark, great care is taken to honor it. It is escorted by as many people as possible from the moment it is taken out of the Ark until it is placed on the reading table. We embrace and kiss the Torah during the procession and refrain from idle chatter. While the Torah is being read, you must be silent and listen to each word.</i>
<i>When the Holy Ark is opened, the following is said:</i>
Whenever the Ark traveled, Moses would say: “Rise, Adonoy and let Your enemies be scattered, and those who hate You, flee before You.” For from Zion will go forth the Torah, and the word of Adonoy from Jerusalem. Blessed is He Who gave the Torah to His people Israel in His holiness.

Berich Shmei

<i>The following prayer is taken from the </i>Zohar<i> (</i>Parshas Vayakhail<i>), the basic text of Kabbalah which was written by the Mishnaic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The </i>Zohar<i> states, “When the Torah is taken out to be read before the congregation, the heavenly gates of mercy are opened, and the Divine love is aroused; therefore one should say the following prayer.</i>
Blessed is the Name of the Master of the universe. Blessed is Your crown and Your place. May Your good will [be] with Your people Israel forever. Show Your people the redemption of Your right hand in Your Holy Temple. Bestow on us Your excellent light, and accept our prayer with compassion. May it be Your will to prolong our lives in well-being. Let me be counted among the righteous, so that You will have compassion on me and protect me and all that is mine, and all that belongs to Your people, Israel. You are He Who nourishes all and maintains all; You are He Who rules over all; You are He Who rules over kings, and the kingdom is Yours. I am a servant of the Holy One, blessed is He, I bow before Him and before the honor of His Torah at all times. Not in man do I put my trust, nor do I rely on any angel; but only in the God of heaven, Who is the true God, Whose Torah is truth, Whose prophets are true, and Who performs many deeds of goodness and truth. In Him I put my trust and to His honored, holy Name I utter praises. May it be Your will to open my heart to Torah, and to fulfill the desires of my heart, and of the heart of Your people Israel, for goodness, for life, and for peace.

Raising the Torah

<i>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Half Kaddish is recited by the Reader. The Torah is then raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</i>
This is the Torah which Moses placed before the children of Israel at Adonoy’s command by the hand of Moses.
It is a tree of life to those who grasp to it, and those who support it are fortunate. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Long life is at its right, at its left, riches and honor. Adonoy desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and to glorify it.
<i>On those Mondays and Thursdays when Tachanun is said, before returning the Torah to the Ark, the Chazzan recites:</i>

Concluding Prayers

Ashrei

Fortunate are those who dwell in Your house; may they continue to praise You, Selah. Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus; Fortunate is the people for whom Adonoy is their God. A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will praise Your works and Your mighty acts they will declare. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak, and Your greatness I will recount. Mention of Your bountifulness they will express, and in Your righteousness joyfully exult. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship, they will speak and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways, and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy, my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.

Lamenatze'ach

<i>According to Rabbi S.R. Hirsch, this psalm is addressed to David by the people of Israel. It is a testimonial of trust that the people have in the Divinely-appointed king, who is accustomed to victory and triumph. At the same time, it proclaims the eternal truth that the victories which our king wins for our people are to be attributed not to his bravery, nor to his sword, nor to his soldiers, but solely to his relationship with God, His Sanctuary, and His Law.</i>
To Him Who grants victory, a Psalm of David May Adonoy answer you on the day of distress; May the Name of Jacob’s<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob’s entire life was filled with trials and distress, and he has thus become the symbol for his descendants throughout their periods of exile and distress.—<i>Radak; S.R.

May He grant you what your heart desires, and fulfill all your plans. We will sing at Your deliverance, and in the Name of our God, raise our banners; May Adonoy fulfill all your wishes. Now I know that Adonoy has delivered His anointed one, He will answer him from His holy heavens with the mighty deliverance of His right hand. Some [rely] upon chariots and some upon horses, but as for us, upon the Name of Adonoy, our God, we call. They have bowed down and fallen, but we have risen and stand firm. Adonoy, deliver [us], the King will answer us on the day we call.

Uva Letzion

<i>This portion, known as </i>Kedushas d’Sidra,<i> was introduced at the conclusion of the morning service to accomodate those who came to the synagogue too late to hear the </i>Kedushah<i> in </i>Shemoneh Esrei.<i> The Talmud (Maseches Sotah 49a) declares that the world is preserved solely by virtue of this </i>Kedushah,<i> and by the virtue of our answering, “May His great Name,” which is part of the </i>Kaddish<i> recited following the study of the Aggadah. Because of its importance, a vernacular translation in Aramaic was added, so that even those ignorant of Hebrew would understand the sacred words.</i>
The Redeemer shall come to Zion and to those of Jacob who repent from sin, says Adonoy. As for Me, this is My covenant with them, said Adonoy: My spirit which is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your children, nor from the mouth of your children’s children, said Adonoy— from now to eternity.

Alenu

It is our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else.

Song of the Day

<i>The custom of reciting a different psalm each day of the week originated in the Temple. The </i>Mishnah<i> (Maseches Tamid 7:4) describes the psalms which were chanted by the Levites each day during the service.</i>

Who is He, this King of Glory? Adonoy of hosts, He is the King of Glory, <i>Selah.</i>
<i>On Monday:</i>
Today is the second day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple:
A song, a psalm by the sons of Korach.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">On the second day, psalm 48, “Adonoy is great and highly extolled,” was sung by the Levites because on the second day of creation God separated the heavenly and earthly parts of the universe and ruled over both.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 31a</i> Adonoy is great and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Beautiful in its panoramic vista, the joy of all the earth is Mount Zion, on the northern extremities (of Jerusalem);<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem is the source of all the joy in the world. Joy radiates from Jerusalem to the rest of the world because it is the center of the universe, both in terms of geography and history. The Temple era is the midpoint of the generations—of the generations which preceded the Temple, and of those which followed its destruction. The generations before the Temple were uplifted and imbued with the hopes of its realization; the later generations are drawn to its light by recalling its radiant glory and by anticipating its rebuilding. We mention Jerusalem at every joyous occasion to emphasize that it is the true source of joy.—<i>Sfas Emes</i><br><i>Tziyun</i> is the Hebrew word for a monument, a memorial for someone who has died. When it is spelled “<i>Tziyon,</i> it refers to the site of God’s Sanctuary, a timeless memorial for the preservation of truth in the midst of mankind. Even though the Temple has been destroyed, the mountain symbolically reminds man of the presence of the true God.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> the city of the great King.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentators say that the great king refers to David, rather than to God.</i> God, in its palaces, has become known as a Stronghold.

They saw and were astounded,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When the kings, who assembled to attack Jerusalem, witnessed the wondrous deeds which God performed in His victorious battle against their armies, they were astounded and terrified.—<i>Radak</i></i> they panicked and fled in haste. Trembling siezed them there, like the pangs of a woman in labor. With an east wind You smashed the ships of Tarshish. As we heard, so we saw in the city of Adonoy of hosts, in the city of our God; may God establish it for eternity, <i>Selah.</i> We hoped, God, for Your lovingkindness in the midst of Your Sanctuary. As Your Name, God, so is Your praise—<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">We testify that Your wondrous deeds match the praise and exalted names which the Prophets used to describe Your might.—<i>Radak</i></i> to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness. Let Mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Or cities of Judah.</i> of Judah exult, because of Your judgments.

That this is God, our God forever and ever, He will lead us like children.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hirsch and others translate, “He will lead us beyond death.” They divide <i>almus</i> into two words <i>al mus.</i> Our translation follows Rashi, who renders it as one word.</i>
<i>On Tuesday:</i>
Today is the third day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple:
A psalm of Assaf<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Assaf was one of the ten composers who contributed to the <i>Book of Psalms;</i> he wrote eleven psalms (73-83). The leading Levite musician of his times, he was also endowed with the spirit of prophecy.</i> God stands in the congregation of the Almighty,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud designates psalm 82 for the third day of the week because on the third day of Creation, God in His wisdom revealed the earth and established the world for His chosen “congregation.” This psalm is an allusion to Genesis 1:9 where we read, “<i>God said, ‘Let the waters beneath the heavens be gathered (congregate) into one place, so that the dry land may appear’.”</i>.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 31a</i> in the midst of the judges He gives judgement. How long will you judge lawlessly and show partiality to the wicked forever? Render justice to the lowly and the orphan, deal righteously with the poor and destitute. Rescue the lowly and the needy, save them from the hand of the wicked. They neither know nor understand,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">“They” refers to the judges.</i> they walk along in darkness, all the foundations of the earth are shaken.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Justice is one of the three pillars upon which the earth rests (Maseches Avos 1:18). Without justice there is no stability in the world.</i> I had said “You are godlike beings, all of you, sons of the Most High.” Nevertheless, you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Arise, God, judge the earth, for You will inherit all the nations.
<i>On Wednesday:</i>
Today is the fourth day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple:
Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 94, “Almighty of vengeance” was sung on the fourth day because God created the sun and the moon on the fourth day, and He will punish those who worship them.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i></i> Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself. Arise Judge of the earth, repay the arrogant their just reward. How long shall the wicked— Adonoy— how long shall the wicked exult? They express, they speak with arrogance; all the evildoers are boastful. Adonoy, they crush Your people and Your heritage they oppress. The widow and stranger they kill, and orphans they murder. And they say, “God does not see, the God of Jacob is not concerned.” Consider, [you] stupid [ones] among the people,— and you fools when will you become wise? He Who implanted the ear, does He not hear? He Who formed the eye, does He not see? He Who chastises nations, does He not reprove— He that teaches man knowledge? Adonoy knows the thoughts of men, that they are vanity. Fortunate is the man whom You chastise, God, and whom You instruct from Your Torah. To grant him tranquility from days of evil, until the pit is dug for the wicked. for Adonoy will not abandon His people and His inheritance, He will not forsake. For justice shall return unto righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it. Who will rise up for me against the wicked, who will stand up for me against the evildoers? Had Adonoy not been my help, in an instant my soul would have dwelt in the silent grave. If [Whenever] I said, my foot has slipped, Your kindliness, Adonoy upheld me. When (worrisome) thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations soothe my soul. Can a tribunal of evil have accord with You— [a tribunal] that makes iniquity into law? They gang up against the life of the righteous, and blood of the innocent they condemn. Adonoy has been my stronghold, my God the Rock of my refuge. He turns their violence against them, and with their own wickedness destroys them; Adonoy, my God, destroys them. Come let us sing to Adonoy; let us shout for joy to the Rock of our Deliverance.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This verse and the following two are from Psalms 95:1-3.</i> Let us greet Him with thanksgiving; with song let us shout for joy to Him. for a great Almighty is Adonoy; a great King over all godlike beings.
<i>On Thursday:</i>
Today is the fifth day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple:
To Him Who grants victory—<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 81 was designated for the fifth day “Because God created the birds and fish on that day.” These creatures bring joy to the world and when people observe the vast variety of the bird and fish species, they are awed by God’s creativity. They are thus inspired to sing joyously to God.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 31a</i> upon the Gittis,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gittis was a musical instrument that was manufactured in the town of Gat.</i> a psalm of Assaf: Sing joyously to God, our strength, shout for joy to the God of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Meiri associates the word הריעו with תרועה, sounding the <i>shofar.</i> Thus the verse reads, “Sound the <i>shofar</i> to the God of Jacob.”</i> Take up the hymn, sound the drum, the pleasant harp and the lute. Blow the <i>shofar</i> on the <i>Rosh Chodesh,</i> at the appointed time for our festive day.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud relates the word כסה with כסה, <i>covering.</i> All other festivals occur when the moon is clearly visible. Rosh Hashana occurs at the beginning of the month when the moon is barely visible.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 8a</i> For it is a statute for Israel, a [day of] judgement of the God of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">S.R. Hirsch translates, “The God of Jacob sits in judgment.”</i> As a testimony for Yehosef, He ordained it<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph feared God’s Name and refused to give in to the wiles of Potiphar’s wife. Because he sanctified God’s Name, he merited that the letter <i>hei</i> from God’s Name should be added to his name, making it Yehosef, יהוסף.—<i>Maseches Sotah</i> 10b.</i> when he went out over the land of Egypt, [where] an unfamiliar language I heard. From the burden, I removed his shoulder, his hands were removed from the cauldron.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi says that this refers to the cooking and menial kitchen tasks which the Jewish slaves were forced to do in Egypt.</i> In distress you called out, and I released you, I answered you [though you called] in secret [I answered you] thunderously; I tested you at the waters of Merivah. <i>Selah.</i> Hear, My people, I will testify about you, Israel, if you would just listen to Me. Let no strange god be within you, nor bow before a foreign god. I am Adonoy, your God, Who brought you up from the land of Egypt, open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">“Open your mouth wide” and state all your desires.</i> But My people did not heed My voice, and Israel did not want Me. So I sent them to follow their heart’s desires, let them follow their own devices. If only My people would heed Me, if Israel would walk in My ways. I would immediately subdue their enemies, and turn My hand against their tormentors. Those who cause hate of Adonoy deceive [pretend obedience to] Him, but their time (of punishment) will be forever. But He would feed him (Israel) from the cream of the wheat, and from the rock, I would sate you with honey.
<i>On Friday:</i>
Today is the sixth day of the week, on which the Levites used to recite in the Holy Temple:
Adonoy has begun His reign,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">On the sixth day, the Levites sang Psalm 93, “Adonoy has begun his reign, with majesty He has clothed Himself,” because He completed the work of creation and reigned over all His creatures.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 31a</i> with majesty He has clothed Himself; Adonoy clothed Himself, with strength He has girded Himself; He has firmly established the world, so that it cannot be moved. Your throne stands firm from of old, You are from eternity. The rivers have raised—Adonoy— the rivers have raised their voice, the rivers raise their raging waves. More than the roar of many waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea, mighty on high are You “Adonoy.” Your testimonies are extremely faithful; holiness is becoming to Your House, Adonoy,—for the length of days.

<i>The following psalm (104) is recited in many synagogues on Rosh Chodesh days, following the daily psalm.</i>

He made the moon to fix seasons the sun knows its place to set. You make darkness and night comes, in which move about all the beasts of the forest. —The young lions roar for prey, and seek their food from the Almighty. [When] the sun rises, they gather and come into their dens to lie. Man goes out to his work, to his labor until evening.
How many are Your works, Adonoy! You made them all with wisdom; the earth is full of Your possessions! This sea, great and wide— therein are innumerable creeping things, animals small and great.

The glory of Adonoy will endure forever, Adonoy will rejoice in His works— Who gazes upon the earth and it trembles; Who touches the mountains and they erupt.

<i>The following psalm (27) is recited at the conclusion of services, morning and evenings, from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres. Others say only until Hoasha’na Rabbah.

Ein Kelohenu

Hope to Adonoy; be strong and He will give you courage and hope to Adonoy. There is none holy like Adonoy for there is none beside You and thee is no stronghold like our God. For who is a god other than Adonoy and who is a stronghold beside our God.
There is none like our God. There is none like our Master. There is none like our King. There is none like our Deliverer. Who is like our God? Who is like our Master? Who is like our King? Who is like our Deliverer? Let us thank our God. Let us thank our Master. Let us thank our King. Let us thank our deliverer. Blessed is our God. Blesed is our Master. Blessed is our King. Blessed is our Deliverer. You are our God. You are our Master. You are our King. You are our Deliverer.
you are He, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers before whom our fathers burned the incenese offering. 

Pitum HaKetoret

The composition of the incense consisted of balm, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense— by weight, seventy maneh of each; myrrh, cassia, spikenard and saffron by weight— sixteen maneh of each; twelve maneh of costus, three maneh of aromatic bark, and nine maneh of cinnamon. [Also used in compounding the incense were:] Nine kabin of Carshina lye, Cyprus wine [measuring] three s'in and three kabin— if he had no Cyprus wine, he could used strong white wine— a fourth of a kab of Sodom salt, and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan. Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says, Add a minute quantity of Jordan amber. If one added honey, the incense became unfit; and if one omitted any of its spices he was liable to the death penalty.
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: The balm is nothing but sap which drips from the balsam tree. Why was Carshina lye used? To refine the onycha in order to make it pleasant. Why was Cyprus wine used? The onycha was soaked in it to give it a pungent odor. Though the water of Raglayim was well suited for that purpose, they did not bring the water of Raglayim into the Temple because it would be disrespectful.
It was taught in the school of Elijah; Whoever studies halachos every day, he is assured of life in the World-to-Come, for it is said, The ways (halichos) of the world are His." Do not read halichos, but halachos:
Rabbi Eliezer said on behalf of Rabbi Chanina: the disciples of the wise increase peace in the world, for it is said: ‘and all your children will be disciples of Adonoy's [Torah]; and great will be the peace of your children.' Do not read banayich [your children] but read bonayich [your builders]. Great is the peace of those who love Your Torah, and they will have no stumbling block [misfortune]. Let there be peace within your moats, serenity within your palaces. For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will say: ‘peace be with you.' For the sake of the House of Adonoy, our God, I will seek [pray for] your good. Adonoy will give strength unto His people; Adonoy will bless his people with peace.

Patriarchs

<i>Fundamentals of </i>Kuzari,<i> (Metsudah Publications, 1979) pages 269, 271, 273.<br>When reciting </i>Shemoneh Esrei,<i> you must adhere to these rules:<br>1. Before beginning the prayer, take three steps backwards and then return to your former position. Upon completing the prayer, take three steps backwards and return.<br>2. Keep your feet together.<br>3. Concentrate on the meaning of the words you are uttering. Remove all distracting thoughts and worries from your mind.<br>4. You may not interrupt </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> by talking, not even by answering Amein. If you should hear </i>Kedushah, Kaddish,<i> or </i>Barechu<i> while saying the </i>Shemoneh Esrei,<i> you should remain silent and listen to the Chazzan’s words.<br>5. At the beginning and end of the first blessing, at the beginning and end of the blessing that begins: “We are thankful to You,” (page 133) and ends with “The Beneficent is Your Name,” (page 140) we half-kneel and bow in the following manner: At the word “Blessed,” bend your knees; at the word “You,” bend forward until the vertebrae of your spinal cord are loosened; at “Adonoy,” return to your upright position in keeping with the verse, “Adonoy straightens the bent” (Psalms 146:8).<br>6. Each individual recites </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> in silence. Only the prayer leader, the </i>Chazzan,<i> ever recites it aloud, and then only after the entire congregation, himself included, has recited it silently.</i>
When I proclaim Adonoy’s Name attribute greatness to our God.
My Master,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When God’s name is spelled <i>Alef-Daled-Nun-Yud</i> it means “my Master”, i.e., it is a personal declaration of the person uttering it. When it is spelled <i>Yud-Hey-Vov-Hey,</i> it indicates God as the Creator of all.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 51:17.</i>
Blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The first blessing of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> contains <i>eighteen</i> expressions of praise which parallel the <i>Eighteen</i> Benedictions.</i> are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children’s children, for the sake of His Name, with love.
<i>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i> Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God.)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">We ask God for life so that we can fulfill His purpose in creating us, i.e., to observe and fulfill His commandments.</i>
<i>If you forgot to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing, you should recite it. If you have already said “Blessed are You Adonoy,” you must continue the prayers without saying “Remember.”</i>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God is a <i>helper</i> in all the fortunes of life by giving us the necessary energy and talents to succeed. He <i>delivers</i> us from both moral and physical suffering, and He <i>shields</i> us by keeping tragedy and evil influences from us.</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">These words complete the first blessing of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called “Avos” (Patriarchs). And here too we bend our knees and bow when saying, “Blessed are You.” The major theme of this section is to praise God as “the Great”, as manifested in the Divine protection and providence He gave to the Patriarchs, of whom Abraham was the first.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i>

Divine Might

You are mighty forever,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">God’s rule of the world is permanent and perpetual.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is the emphatic expression of our belief in the immortality of the soul.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> the Powerful One<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This passage begins the section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called “Gevuros” (Might) and its major theme is to praise God as “the Mighty One.” Who alone restores man to life, health, freedom, and well-being.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i> to deliver us.
<i>From the Musaf of the first day of Pesach until the Musaf of Shemini Atzeres one should say:</i>
He causes the dew to descend.
<i>From the Musaf of </i>Shemini Atzeres<i> until the </i>Musaf<i> of the first day of Pesach you should say:</i>
Causer of the wind to blow and of the rain to fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God’s might is as much manifested in causing the rain as it is in reviving the dead. In fact the Talmud (Maseches Taanis 7a) declares in the name of Rabbi Avohu: “The day when rain falls is greater than the day of the resurrection of the dead.” Rabbi Yochanan said, (<i>Ibid,</i> 2a): “There are three ׳keys’ which God retains in His own hands and does not entrust to any emissary: the key to rain, the key to childbirth, and the key to the resurrection of the dead.”</i>
<i>If you neglected to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים, “the Resurrector of the dead,” you must say it at that time. If you reminded yourself after saying וְנֶאֱמָן אַתָּה “You are faithful,” you must repeat it and then complete the blessing of מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים. If you became aware of your omission after starting the blessing אַתָּה קָדוֹשׁ “You are holy,” even if you only said the word “You,” say the Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If during the first thirty days after </i>Shemini Atzeres<i> you are in doubt whether you said it, you must assume that you didnot say it. After thirty days, however, since you have become accustomed to saying it, you may assume that you recited the proper phrase and you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.</i>
Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The most extraordinary manifestation of God’s might—to our perception—is when He restores the dead to life. <i>Avudraham</i> writes that the three following praises represent various examples of how God restores life to those who arc near death. When a person falls (either physically or morally) he is often near death; thus, when God supports the fallen he restores their lives. When a person is sick, he often faces death, so when God heals the sick He restores their lives. A person who is imprisoned—i.e., confined—is like dead; thus when God releases the imprisoned He restores their lives.</i> with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Just as God shows His faithfulness to the living, so too will He keep faith with the dead who lie in the dust. Others say that “Those who sleep in the dust” refers to the Patriarchs; God will remember the oath He made to them and keep His promises to them.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deliverance will “grow” in stages rather than all at once.</i>
<i>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i> Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy)
<i>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning “Remember us for life.”</i>
And You are faithful<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">How remarkable is the Jew’s conviction of God’s faithfulness. When the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing of “Resurrector of the dead,” the Jew responds, “Amein” even though he has not seen God restore the dead to life; when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Redeemer of Israel,” he responds “Amein”, even though he has not yet been delivered; and when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Builder of Jerusalem,” he responds “Amein” even though Jerusalem has not yet been rebuilt.—<i>Midrash Tanchuma</i></i> to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.
<i>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei, the Kedushah is said here)</i>

Holiness of God

You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. For You are an Almighty King— great and holy.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty, the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing completes the section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> called <i>Kedushah</i> (Holiness) which emphasizes that God is indeed awesome.</i>
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One.
<i>If you mistakenly said, “the Almighty” instead of “the King,” or if you are in doubt—if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), or if you had already started the next blessing, you must say the Shmoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you became aware of your error before that, you should immediately say “the King the Holy One” and continue your prayers.</i>

Keduasha

<i>The Congregation says and the Chazzan repeats:</i>
We will hallow Your Name in the world, as they hallow it in the heavens above, as is written by the hand of Your prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:3.</i> And they called one to another, and said:

<i>The Chazzan says:</i>
From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness, and to all eternity, we will sanctify Your holiness, and Your praise, our God, will not depart from our mouth forever and ever; because You are the Almighty Who is King; Great, and Holy.

Knowledge

You favor man with perception<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing “You favor man with perception” begins the group of thirteen petitions which make up the “intermediate” section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> The first six petitions (blessings 4-9) are for our individual needs and well-being: understanding, repentance, forgiveness of sins, deliverance from trouble, from illness, and from want. Though these six petitions are of a personal nature, they voice the needs of all mankind. Note that the worshipper prays for his spiritual needs—knowledge, repentance, and forgiveness before he prays for his physical wants.</i> and teach mankind understanding. Grant us knowledge, understanding and intellect from You. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Grantor of perception.

Repentance

Cause us to return,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The goal of wisdom is the realization of man’s true relationship to his Maker. Wisdom should be used for Torah study and Divine service.</i> our Father, to Your Torah and bring us near, our King, to Your service; and bring us back in whole-hearted repentance<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Sages say, “Repent the day before you die” (Maseches Avos 2:10), and every day may be our last, we petition God daily for Divine guidance in repenting.</i> before You Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who desires penitence.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Repentance in Judaism implies regret for past misconduct and firm resolve for correct conduct in the future. God holds out His hand to the erring sinner and leads him back to righteousness, as the Talmud (Maseches Yoma 38b) declares, הבא ליטהר מסיעין אותו. God desires penitence as it is written, “I do not desire the death of the wicked: but (rather) that the wicked return from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11).</i>

Forgiveness

Pardon<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Sin can only be pardoned after repentance. Hence, the order of these two petitions. Even if a person was the worst of sinners, his supplication (after repentance) makes him fit to receive Divine mercy and helps him attain it—<i>R’ Yosef Albo</i></i> us, our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed;<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Error, חטא, is the result of carelessness, ignorance, or weakness; sin, פשע, is a deliberate disregard of moral or religious duty.</i> for You forgive and pardon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Gracious One, Who pardons abundantly.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">“Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity, his thoughts. Let him return to Adonoy and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God for He abundantly pardons” (Isaiah 55:7).</i>

Redemption

Look upon our affliction, and defend our cause: and redeem us speedily<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As an outgrowth of our penitence and our forgiveness we pray that we may be deemed worthy of Divine redemption.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> for the sake of Your Name; because You are a Mighty Redeemer. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Redeemer of Israel.
<i>(On Fast Days, the Chazzan says “Answer us” and concludes, “Blessed are ... Who responds at times of trouble.”)</i>

Healing

Heal us,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">After the petitions for our spiritual needs, we pray for earthly blessings—for health of body and soul, and for food to maintain our strength.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> Adonoy, and we will be healed, deliver us and we will be delivered; for You are our praise. Grant a complete healing to all our affliction
<i>If you wish to pray for the recovery of a sick person, you may do so here.</i>
<small>May it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and the God of our fathers, that You send, quickly, a complete recovery from the heavens, healing for the soul, and healing for the body, for the ailing (<i>name</i>) son/daughter of (<i>mother’s name</i>) among the ailing of Israel.</small>

If you reminded yourself after concluding the blessing שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה, but before you started רְצֵה, “be pleased,” you may say: “bestow dew and rain,” וְתֵן טַל וּמָטָר and then continue with רְצֵה . If you remembered after that you must go back and say the 9th blessing, בָּרֵךְ עָלֵינוּ, and continue from there. But if you became aware of your omission after concluding the entire Shemoneh Esrei [and taking three steps backwards] you must repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei.</i>

Gathering the Exiles

Sound the great <i>shofar</i> for our liberty,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The following six benedictions, beginning with this one, are prayers for the restoration of the spiritual-national life of the Jewish People.

Justice

Blessed are You, Adonoy, King, Lover of righteousness and justice.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King of Justice.
<i>If you mistakenly said, “King, Lover of righteousness and justice,” instead of “the King of Justice” and became aware of your mistake within the time it takes to utter the three word greeting (Sholom Aleichem Rebbe), you should immediately say “the King of Justice.” If you remembered after that interval, you may continue the Shemoneh Esrei since the word “King” was mentioned in the regular blessing.</i>

Against Enemies

Let there be no hope for informers <sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This petition was added to the original Eighteen Benedictions. It was ordained by Rabban Gamliel and his <i>Bais Din</i> in Yavneh, according to the text of Shmuel HaKattan, its author (Maseches Berachos 28:b).

The Righteous

May Your mercy be aroused, Adonoy our God, upon the righteous,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer for the righteous follows the prayer against the wicked, following the same sequence of the Psalmist’s verse, “And all the pride of the wicked, I shall cut down; exalted will be the pride of the righteous” (75:11).—Talmud, <i>Maseches Megillah</i> 17b</i> upon the pious, upon the elders of Your people, Israel, upon the remnant of their scholars, upon the true proselytes and upon us.

Rebuilding Jerusalem

And return in mercy to Jerusalem,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The “pride of the righteous will be exalted” in the restored city of Jerusalem.

We therefore ask God to take pleasure in the entire people of Israel among whom there are pious and righteous individuals who possess great merit, and we ask Him to accept “their prayer” with love and satisfaction.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer “Be pleased” in a different form was recited by the <i>Kohanim</i> (priests) every day following the morning fire-offering.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11b</i> of Israel; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly.

In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for our eyes are directed to You, because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
<i>If you forgot to say this at Shacharis, (the Morning Service) or at Mincha (the Afternoon Service), but realized your omission before saying מוֹדִים, “We are thankful,” you should say it at that time and continue with מוֹדִים. If you became aware of your omission after saying “מוֹדִים” “We are thankful,” but before concluding the Shemoneh Esrei [and taking three steps backwards], start again from רְצֵה, “Be pleased.” If you had completed the Shemoneh Esrei and then remembered, you must repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you are in doubt, follow the same procedure as above. If you had already said the Musaf prayer and recalled your omission, it is the opinion of some authorities, that the<i> Shemoneh Esrei</i> of </i>Shacharis<i> be repeated as a נְדָבָה, a free-will-offering of prayer, rather than an obligatory prayer.</i>

Thanksgiving

<i>At the words, </i>We are thankful,<i> bend forward; at </i>Adonoy<i> return to an upright position.</i>
We are thankful to You<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Here you should bow in gratitude, as if standing before the Divine Presence, and say, “We are thankful to You.” The Jews always bowed when they perceived the Divine Presence..—<i>Kuzari</i></i> that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, You are the Shield of our deliverance  in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Here we thank God for returning our souls each morning, after having “entrusted” them to Him all night.—<i>Eitz Yosef</i></i> and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase concludes the earlier declaration, “We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise ... evening, morning, and noon .”—<i>Iyun Tefillalh</i></i> (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You.
<i>(When the Chazzan repeats the </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was ordained by Rav and his colleagues. It is an abstract of several prayers recited by various Rabbis [<i>=Rabanan</i>], and for this reason it is called </i>Modim D’Rabanan.<i></i>)</i>
We are thankful to You, that You Adonoy are our God, and God of our fathers, God of all flesh, Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and holy Name for keeping us alive, and sustaining us; so may You always keep us alive and sustain us, and gather our exiles to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary to observe Your statutes, and to do Your will, and to serve You wholeheartedly, for we are thankful to You. Blessed is the Almighty to Whom all thanks are due.
<i>(On Chanukah and Purim the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, “וְעַל כֻּלָּם, and for all the foregoing.”)</i>
[We thank You] for the miracles, for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
<i>On Chanukah:</i> In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to rationally conceived laws. S.R. Hirsch comments: The Greeks knew that the key to the Jewish religion is the Torah. If Torah were forgotten, the decline of ritual observance would be inevitable and rapid. Thus, they concentrated first on causing Torah to be forgotten, knowing that the deterioration of religious observance would swiftly follow.</i> and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<i>On Purim:</i> In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The usual procedure of those times was that all the wealth of executed people reverted to the monarch. In contrast to the norm, Haman decreed that Jewish possessions would be free for all to enjoy. He did this to provide added incentive to the populace who might have hesitated to kill Jews if they had nothing to gain.</i>— And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows. And You made a miracle and a wonder for them, and we are thankful to Your great name forever.  
And for all the foregoing may Your Name, our King, constantly be blessed and extolled, forever and ever.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</i> Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.
<i>If you forget to say this, you need not go back and repeat it. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity — the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy; Your Name is The Beneficent and You it is fitting to praise.

Birkat Kohanim

And may it be good in Your sight to bless Your people, Israel, at all times and at every moment with Your peace.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</i> May we be remembered and inscribed before You in the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance; we and all Your people, the House of Israel, for a good life and peace.
<i>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</i>

Vidui and 13 Middot



Avinu Malkenu

<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, </i>Avinu Malkeinu<i> is recited here during </i>Shacharis<i>—the morning service, and </i>Mincha<i>—the afternoon service. It is also said by some congregations on public Fast Days. The number of petitions in this prayer varies with custom, but in our rite, </i>Avinu Malkeinu<i> consists of 44 petitions. Since many of them are similar to the petitions of </i>Shemoneh Esrei, Avinu Malkeinu<i> is never recited on Shabbos, when the petitions of </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> are also omitted. This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (Maseches Taanis 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, “Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us,” and rain fell.</i>
Our Father, our King!<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as God’s slaves (Leviticus 25:42), and as His children (Deuteronomy 14:1).

There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire.

Tachanun

Nefilat Appayim

David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hands of Adonoy, for His compassion is great; and let me not fall into the hands of men.”
Merciful and Gracious One, I have sinned before You; Adonoy, full of mercy, have compassion upon me and accept my supplications: Adonoy, do not punish me in anger, do not chastise me in fury. Have mercy on me, Adonoy, for I languish; heal me, Adonoy, for my bones shake with terror. My whole being is stricken with terror, while You, Adonoy —O, how long! Adonoy, turn! Rescue me! Deliver me as befits Your faithfulness. For there is no praise of You among the dead; in Sheol, who can acclaim You? I am weary with groaning; every night I drench my bed, I melt my couch in tears. My eyes are wasted by vexation, worn out because of all my foes. Away from me, all you evildoers, for Adonoy heeds the sound of my weeping. Adonoy heeds my plea, Adonoy accepts my prayer. All my enemies will be frustrated and stricken with terror; they will turn back in an instant, frustrated.

Concluding Prayers

Alenu

It is our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else. Our King is true, all else is insignificant, as it is written in His Torah: And You shall know this day and take into Your heart that Adonoy is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is nothing else.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:39.</i>

And they will all accept [upon themselves] the yoke of Your kingdom, and You will reign over them, soon, forever and ever.

Maariv

Vehu Rachum

<i>Unlike the morning </i>Shacharis<i> and afternoon </i>Mincha<i> services which correspond to the two daily communal sacrifices (</i>Tamid<i>), offered in the Temple, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, the evening </i>Maariv<i> service has no counterpart in the Temple service, since sacrifices were never brought at night in the Temple. The </i>Maariv<i> service was instituted to correspond to the Temple ritual of keeping on the altar the unconsumed parts of sacrifices that had been offered earlier in the day. These parts were kept on the altar at night so that they could be completely consumed by its fire. This ritual was applicable only if there actually were uncon- sumed parts of offerings. Although the </i>Maariv<i> service was instituted to correspond to this ritual, and may therefore seem to be non-obligatory (see </i>Maseches Berachos<i> 27b), Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi and all the other codifiers have ruled that </i>Maariv<i> has been accepted and hallowed by custom, and is therefore an obligatory service. The </i>Shema<i> is preceded by two blessings and followed by two other blessings.</i>

In the evening when man pauses from the rush of his daily activities, he is conscious of having sinned during the day, and thus begins his prayer with this appeal for Divine mercy.—<i>Machzor Vitry</i><br>Midrash Tanchuma (<i>Pinchos</i> 13) notes that the morning sacrifice (תמיד של שחר) atoned for sins committed during the night, while the afternoon sacrifice (תמיד של בין הערבים) atoned for sins committed during the day. Since the evening service does not represent Temple sacrifice, it became customary to recite this verse because it mentions that God “atones iniquity.”—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Adonoy, deliver [us!] The King will answer us on the day we call.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 20:10.</i>

Barchu

<i>The </i>Chazzan<i> says:</i>
Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<i>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</i>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed forever and ever.

Blessings of the Shema

First Blessing before Shema

Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, With His word He brings on evenings, with wisdom He opens the gates<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These are the gates of sunrise and sunset through which God, in His infinite wisdom, has divided life on earth into two complementary halves.—<i>Rabbi S.R. Hirsch</i></i> (of heaven); and with understanding changes<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He alternates the three daily periods—evening, morning, and afternoon.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> the times and alternates the seasons, and arranges the stars in their watches,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The stars appear as watchmen appointed by God to stand guard over the sleeping world below. He also appointed them their places in definite orbits, according to His will, and for purposes known to Him alone.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> in the sky, according to His will. He creates day and night, He rolls the light away from before darkness, and darkness from before light; He causes day to pass and brings night, and separates between day and night; Adonoy of Hosts<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">His Name, ה’ צבאות, means “He Who takes all the infinite variety of hosts and creatures and unites them to act and interact as parts of one unified Universe.”—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> is His Name. The Almighty, [Who is] living and enduring will always reign over us forever and ever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who brings on evening.

Second Blessing before Shema

[With] An everlasting love<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer is an abbreviated form of the אהבה רבה prayer in the morning service. It thanks God for the sacred gift of Divine Revelation that He granted Israel. It declares that Torah alone is the eternal heritage of the Jewish people and that all other goods and gifts of life are transitory.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> You loved the House of Israel, Your people. You taught us Torah and commandments, statutes and laws. Therefore, Adonoy, our God, when we lie down and when we rise, we will discuss Your statutes, and rejoice in the words of Your Torah and in Your commandments forever. For they are our life and they lengthen our days, and on them we will meditate day and night. [May] Your love never be removed from us. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who loves His people Israel.

Shema

<i>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</i>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Israel: Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.</b>
<i>The following three lines are to be said silently:</i>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.
And you shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your possessions. And these words which I command you today, shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them sharply to your children. And you shall discuss them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways.
And it will be— if you vigilantly obey My commandments which I command you this day, to love Adonoy your God, and serve Him with your entire hearts and with your entire souls— that I will give rain for your land in its proper time, the early (autumn) rain and the late (spring) rain; and you will harvest your grain and your wine and your oil. And I will put grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. Beware lest your hearts be swayed and you turn astray, and you worship alien gods and bow to them. And Adonoy’s fury will blaze among you, and He will close off the heavens and there will be no rain and the earth will not yield its produce; and you will perish swiftly from the good land which Adonoy gives you. Place these words of Mine upon your hearts and upon your souls,— and bind them for a sign upon your hands, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall teach them to your sons, to speak them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways. In order that your days be prolonged, and the days of your children, upon the land which Adonoy swore to your fathers to give them [for as long] as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations; and they will place with the fringes of each corner a thread of blue. And it will be to you for fringes, and you will look upon it and you will remember all the commandments of Adonoy, and you will perform them; and you will not turn aside after your hearts and after your eyes which cause you to go astray. In order that you will remember and perform all My commandments; and you will be holy unto your God. I am Adonoy, your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am Adonoy, your God—
<i>You must be careful to connect the last words of Shema, ה’ אֱלֹקֵיכֶם (Adonoy, your God), with the word אֶמֶת (is true) without pause or interruption so that these three words form one sentence, meaning “Adonoy your God is true” (Maseches Berachos 13a).</i>
—is true—
<i>The chazan repeats:</i>
Adonoy, your God, is true.

First Blessing after Shema

<i>This is the first of the two berachos that follow the Shema.</i>
—and faithful is all this,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">All that we have affirmed in the Shema. is true and trustworthy.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> and it is permanently established with us that he is Adonoy, our God, and there is nothing besides Him, and that we, Israel, are His people.

He does great things<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“Great things” refers to the way God rules according to the laws of nature and “wonders” refers to those things that are classified as miracles.—<i>Siach Yitzchak</i></i> beyond comprehension, miracles and wonders without number. He sustains our soul in life<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Not only does God sustain our souls in exile, but He also sustains our physical well-being.—<i>Siach Yitzchak</i></i> and does not allow our feet to slip. He makes us tread upon the high places of our enemies, and exalts our strength over all who hate us. He performed miracles for us and vengeance upon Pharaoh, signs and wonders in the land of the Hamites. He slew in His wrath, all the firstborn of Egypt, and brought out His people, Israel, from their midst to everlasting<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The redemption from Egypt is the source for all later redemptions; it is the source from which our final and total salvation will spring. We became free, never again to taste the bitterness of spiritual or physical bondage.—<i>Sfas Emes</i></i> freedom. He led His children through the divided parts of the Sea of Reeds, their pursuers and their enemies He drowned in its depths. And His children saw His mighty power— they praised and gave thanks to His Name, His sovereignty they willingly accepted; Moses and the children of Israel sang unto You with great joy, and they all said:
“Who is like You among the mighty, Adonoy! Who is like You? [You are] adorned in holiness, awesome in praise, performing wonders”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 15:11.</i> Your children beheld Your sovereignty when You divided the sea before Moses. “This is my God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 15:2.</i> they exclaimed, and declared,
“Adonoy will reign forever and ever.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 15:18.</i> And it is said, “For Adonoy has liberated Jacob and redeemed him from a hand, mightier than his.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 31:10.</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy Who has redeemed Israel.

Second Blessing after Shema

<i>This is the second of the benedictions that follow the Sh’ma.</i>
Adonoy our God; make us lie down in peace, our King, raise us again to life<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Undisturbed peace, and strength for a new day of vigorous living, are the gifts that night brings and for which we pray to God.—<i>S.R.

Daytime is the time for achievement, but the rest that comes with nightfall is made to allow man to compose his thoughts. By virtue of the complete relaxation It affords, sleep endows the mind and spirit with renewed vigor. We pray therefore for Divine aid so that our nightly rest will help us take wise counsel and affirm worthy resolution for future days.—<i>Avudraham</i> and <i>Siach Yitzchak</i></i> and deliver us for Your Name’s sake. Shield us, and remove from us<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Shield us from trouble before it comes, and remove it from us if it has already come.—<i>Siach Yitzchak</i></i> enemies, pestilence, sword, famine and sorrow. Remove the adversary<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word שטן (Satan) used in the Prayer Book refers to the Evil Impulse, the lower passions which are a hindrance to man’s pursuit of the nobler aims in life. It is against the dominance of this impulse that the Jew prays. The “adversary,” therefore, is any person, spirit, or Evil Impulse that seduces us to do wrong.—<i>Dover Sholom</i> and others</i> from before us and from behind us, and shelter us in the shadow of Your wings. For, Almighty, You are our Protector and Rescuer, For, Almighty You are a gracious and merciful King. Guard our going out and our coming in for life and peace for now forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who guards His people Israel forever.

Third Blessing after Shema

<i>The following prayer was originally a compilation of eighteen verses instituted during the Gaonic era as a substitute for the </i>Shemoneh Esrei.<i> According to Avudraham, the </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> was omitted because of decrees issued against the Jews that banned them from participating in the Evening Service. These eighteen verses, adopted in place of the </i>Shemoneh Esrei,<i> have remained a part of the </i>Maariv<i> service. Some Halachic commentaries maintain that these verses should not be included in </i>Maariv,<i> because they constitute an interruption between the final blessing after Shema and the </i>Shemoneh Esrei.<i></i>

Half Kaddish

<i>The Chazzan recites the following half-Kaddish</i>
Exalted and sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These opening words refer to the fulfillment of God’s prophecy, through Ezekiel (38:23) “And I will thus exalt Myself and sanctify Myself; and I will be known in the eyes of the many nations, and they will know that I am Adonoy.”—<i>Levush, Siddur HaGra</i>. One should be very careful to emphasize the letter gimel (ג) when saying the word “Yisgadal (יִתְגַּדַּל),” in order that it not be heard as “Yis<i>k</i>adal (יִתְקַּדַל),” from the word קְדָל which means neck.—<i>Mishnah Berurah 56:2</i></i> be His great Name

Amidah

Patriarchs

<i>Fundamentals of </i>Kuzari,<i> (Metsudah Publications, 1979) pages 269, 271, 273.<br>When reciting </i>Shemoneh Esrei,<i> you must adhere to these rules:<br>1. Before beginning the prayer, take three steps backwards and then return to your former position. Upon completing the prayer, take three steps backwards and return.<br>2. Keep your feet together.<br>3. Concentrate on the meaning of the words you are uttering. Remove all distracting thoughts and worries from your mind.<br>4. You may not interrupt </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> by talking, not even by answering Amein. If you should hear </i>Kedushah, Kaddish,<i> or </i>Barechu<i> while saying the </i>Shemoneh Esrei,<i> you should remain silent and listen to the Chazzan’s words.<br>5. At the beginning and end of the first blessing, at the beginning and end of the blessing that begins: “We are thankful to You,” (page 133) and ends with “The Beneficent is Your Name,” (page 140) we half-kneel and bow in the following manner: At the word “Blessed,” bend your knees; at the word “You,” bend forward until the vertebrae of your spinal cord are loosened; at “Adonoy,” return to your upright position in keeping with the verse, “Adonoy straightens the bent” (Psalms 146:8).<br>6. Each individual recites </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> in silence. Only the prayer leader, the </i>Chazzan,<i> ever recites it aloud, and then only after the entire congregation, himself included, has recited it silently.</i>
My Master, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, most high Almighty, Who bestows beneficent kindness, Who possesses everything, Who remembers the piety of the Patriarchs, and Who brings a redeemer to their children’s children, for the sake of His Name, with love.
<i>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i> Remember us for life King, Who desires life; and inscribe us in the Book of Life, for Your sake, Living God.)
<i>If you forgot to say this, see page 000.</i>
King, Helper, and Deliverer and Shield. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.

Divine Might

You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead the Powerful One to deliver us.
<i>From the Musaf of the first day of Pesach until the Musaf of Shemini Atzeres one should say:</i>
He causes the dew to descend.
<i>From the Musaf of </i>Shemini Atzeres<i> until the </i>Musaf<i> of the first day of Pesach you should say:</i>
Causer of the wind to blow and of the rain to fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God’s might is as much manifested in causing the rain as it is in reviving the dead. In fact the Talmud (Maseches Taanis 7a) declares in the name of Rabbi Avohu: “The day when rain falls is greater than the day of the resurrection of the dead.” Rabbi Yochanan said, (<i>Ibid,</i> 2a): “There are three ׳keys’ which God retains in His own hands and does not entrust to any emissary: the key to rain, the key to childbirth, and the key to the resurrection of the dead.”</i>
<i>If you neglected to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים, “the Resurrector of the dead,” you must say it at that time. If you reminded yourself after saying וְנֶאֱמָן אַתָּה “You are faithful,” you must repeat it and then complete the blessing of מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים. If you became aware of your omission after starting the blessing אַתָּה קָדוֹשׁ “You are holy,” even if you only said the word “You,” say the Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If during the first thirty days after </i>Shemini Atzeres<i> you are in doubt whether you said it, you must assume that you didnot say it. After thirty days, however, since you have become accustomed to saying it, you may assume that you recited the proper phrase and you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.</i>
Sustainer of the living with kindliness, Resurrector of the dead with great mercy, Supporter of the fallen, and Healer of the sick, and Releaser of the imprisoned, and Fulfiller of His faithfulness to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You? King Who causes death and restores life, and causes deliverance to sprout forth.
<i>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i> Who is like You merciful Father, Who remembers His creatures for life, in His mercy.)
<i>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning “Remember us for life.”</i>
And You are faithful to restore the dead to life. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Resurrector of the dead.

Holiness of God

<i>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning “Remember us for life.”</i>
You are holy and Your Name is holy and holy beings praise You every day, forever. For You are an Almighty King— great and holy.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, the Almighty, the Holy One.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence:</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King, the Holy One.
<i>If you mistakenly said, “the Almighty” instead of “the King,” or if you are in doubt—if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), or if you had already started the next blessing, you must say the Shmoneh Esrei from the beginning. If you became aware of your error before that, you should immediately say “the King the Holy One” and continue your prayers.</i>

Knowledge

You favor man with perception<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing “You favor man with perception” begins the group of thirteen petitions which make up the “intermediate” section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> The first six petitions (blessings 4-9) are for our individual needs and well-being: understanding, repentance, forgiveness of sins, deliverance from trouble, from illness, and from want. Though these six petitions are of a personal nature, they voice the needs of all mankind. Note that the worshipper prays for his spiritual needs—knowledge, repentance, and forgiveness before he prays for his physical wants.</i> and teach mankind understanding.
(You have favored us [with the ability] to know Your Torah and taught us to fulfill the statutes of Your will. You made a distinction, Adonoy, our God, between sacred and unhallowed, between light and darkness, between Israel and the peoples, between the seventh day and the six work days. Our Father, our King, commence for us the days that approach us, in peace, devoid of all sin, and cleansed of all iniquity, and devoted to the fear of You.)
Grant us knowledge, understanding and intellect from You. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Grantor of perception.

Repentance

Cause us to return, our Father, to Your Torah and bring us near, our King, to Your service; and bring us back in whole-hearted repentance before You Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who desires penitence.

Forgiveness

Pardon<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Sin can only be pardoned after repentance. Hence, the order of these two petitions. Even if a person was the worst of sinners, his supplication (after repentance) makes him fit to receive Divine mercy and helps him attain it—<i>R’ Yosef Albo</i></i> us, our Father, for we have sinned, forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed;<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Error, חטא, is the result of carelessness, ignorance, or weakness; sin, פשע, is a deliberate disregard of moral or religious duty.</i> for You forgive and pardon. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Gracious One, Who pardons abundantly.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">“Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity, his thoughts. Let him return to Adonoy and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God for He abundantly pardons” (Isaiah 55:7).</i>

Redemption

Look upon our affliction, and defend our cause: and redeem us speedily<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">As an outgrowth of our penitence and our forgiveness we pray that we may be deemed worthy of Divine redemption.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> for the sake of Your Name; because You are a Mighty Redeemer. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Redeemer of Israel.

Healing

Heal us,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">After the petitions for our spiritual needs, we pray for earthly blessings—for health of body and soul, and for food to maintain our strength.—<i>Kuzari</i></i> Adonoy, and we will be healed, deliver us and we will be delivered; for You are our praise. Grant a complete healing to all our affliction because You are the Almighty, King, Who is a faithful and merciful Healer. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Healer of the sick of His people Israel.

Prosperity

Bless for us, Adonoy our God, this year and all the varieties of its produce for good; and bestow

Blessed are You, Adonoy, Blesser of the years.
<i>* If you forgot to say this and became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you may say it at that time and conclude the blessing. If you became aware of your omission after saying the blessing, continue the prayers, and before concluding the 16th blessing שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה, “Who heeds prayer,” say: וְתֵן טַל וּמָטָר לִבְרָכָה כִּי אַתָּה וגו’ “bestow dew and rain for blessing, for you heed etc.”. If you reminded yourself after concluding the blessing שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה, but before you started רְצֵה, “be pleased,” you may say: “bestow dew and rain,” וְתֵן טַל וּמָטָר and then continue with רְצֵה . If you remembered after that you must go back and say the 9th blessing, בָּרֵךְ עָלֵינוּ, and continue from there. But if you became aware of your omission after concluding the entire Shemoneh Esrei [and taking three steps backwards] you must repeat the entire Shemoneh Esrei.</i>

Gathering the Exiles

Sound the great <i>shofar</i> for our liberty,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The following six benedictions, beginning with this one, are prayers for the restoration of the spiritual-national life of the Jewish People. This tenth benediction is an impassioned prayer for the fulfillment of the prophecy, “And it will come to pass on that day, the great Shofar will be sounded; and those who were lost in the land of Assyria shall come and those who were dispersed in the land of Egypt; and they will worship Adonoy on the Holy Mountain at Jerusalem (Isaiah 27:13).—<i>Avudraham</i></i> and raise a banner to gather our exiles, and gather us together from the four corners of the earth.

Blessed are You, Adonoy, King, Lover of righteousness and justice.
<i>*During the Ten Days of Penitence:</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, the King of Justice.
<i>If you mistakenly said, “King, Lover of righteousness and justice,” instead of “the King of Justice” and became aware of your mistake within the time it takes to utter the three word greeting (Sholom Aleichem Rebbe), you should immediately say “the King of Justice.” If you remembered after that interval, you may continue the Shemoneh Esrei since the word “King” was mentioned in the regular blessing.</i>

Against Enemies

The Righteous

May Your mercy be aroused, Adonoy our God, upon the righteous,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer for the righteous follows the prayer against the wicked, following the same sequence of the Psalmist’s verse, “And all the pride of the wicked, I shall cut down; exalted will be the pride of the righteous” (75:11).—Talmud, <i>Maseches Megillah</i> 17b</i> upon the pious, upon the elders of Your people, Israel, upon the remnant of their scholars, upon the true proselytes and upon us. Grant bountiful reward to all who trust in Your Name in truth;<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">As King David said, “Those <i>knowing </i>Your Name will <i>trust</i> in You” (Psalms 9:11). These men who perceive God’s ways with undistorted clarity are of the highest caliber.

Rebuilding Jerusalem

And return in mercy to Jerusalem,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The “pride of the righteous will be exalted” in the restored city of Jerusalem. Hence in this blessing we plead for the reconstruction of Jerusalem, as it is stated, “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may they who love You have peace” (Psalms 122:6)<i>—Maseches Megillah</i> 17b</i> Your city, and dwell therein as You have spoken; and rebuild it soon, in our days, as an everlasting structure, and may You speedily establish the throne of David therein. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Builder of Jerusalem.

Kingdom of David

Speedily cause the sprout of David,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer for the Messiah, descendant of David, follows the prayer for Jerusalem, following the sequence of Hosea’s prophecy (3:5), “Afterward, the Children of Israel will return to Jerusalem and seek Adonoy their God, and David their King “—<i>Masechcas Megillah</i> 18a</i> Your servant,  to flourish and exalt his power with Your deliverance. We hope all day for Your deliverance. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who causes the power of salvation to sprout.

Response to Prayer

Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The last of the intermediate benedictions petitions God to answer all our preceding prayers.</i> spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers compassionately and willingly, for You are Almighty Who hears prayers and supplications; and do not turn us away empty-handed from Your Presence, our King,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">At this point, the worshiper may add any private petition, and ask God’s help for himself, for his household, or for his community.</i> for You hear the prayers of Your people, Israel, with compassion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who hears prayers.

Temple Service

Be pleased,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The three concluding benedictions are known as the benedictions of thanksgiving. They consist of prayers for the re-establishment of God’s service at Jerusalem; thanksgiving for God’s daily wonders in our behalf; and a prayer for peace and prosperity.</i> Adonoy, our God, with Your people, Israel, and their prayer;<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous blessings the first person was used: “Heal us,” “Have mercy on us,” whereas here the third person is used: “Their prayer,” “Accept their prayer.” In order to achieve a level in which we will be a source of pleasure to God, we must possess greater merit than what we as individuals can claim. We therefore ask God to take pleasure in the entire people of Israel among whom there are pious and righteous individuals who possess great merit, and we ask Him to accept “their prayer” with love and satisfaction.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> and restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode, and the fire-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer “Be pleased” in a different form was recited by the <i>Kohanim</i> (priests) every day following the morning fire-offering.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11b</i> of Israel; and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly. And may You always find pleasure with the service of Your people, Israel.
<i>On regular weekdays continue, “And may our eyes”. On Rosh Chodesh and on Chol HaMoed, the following prayer is added:</i> 
Our God and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of David, Your servant; the remembrance of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Israel, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for life and peace on this day of the: <i>Rosh Chodesh/Festival of Matzos/Festival of Sukkos</i>. Remember us Adonoy, our God, on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for our eyes are directed to You, because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
And may our eyes behold Your merciful return to Zion. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.

Thanksgiving

<i>At the words, </i>We are thankful,<i> bend forward; at </i>Adonoy<i> return to an upright position.</i>
We are thankful to You<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Here you should bow in gratitude, as if standing before the Divine Presence, and say, “We are thankful to You.” The Jews always bowed when they perceived the Divine Presence..—<i>Kuzari</i></i> that You Adonoy are our God and the God of our fathers forever; Rock of our lives, You are the Shield of our deliverance  in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Here we thank God for returning our souls each morning, after having “entrusted” them to Him all night.—<i>Eitz Yosef</i></i> and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times— evening, morning and noon.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase concludes the earlier declaration, “We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise ... evening, morning, and noon .”—<i>Iyun Tefillalh</i></i> (You are) The Beneficent One— for Your compassion is never withheld; And (You are) the Merciful One— for Your kindliness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You.
<i>(On Chanukah and Purim the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, “וְעַל כֻּלָּם, and for all the foregoing.”)</i>
[We thank You] for the miracles, for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
<i>On Chanukah:</i> In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<i>On Purim:</i> In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The usual procedure of those times was that all the wealth of executed people reverted to the monarch. In contrast to the norm, Haman decreed that Jewish possessions would be free for all to enjoy. He did this to provide added incentive to the populace who might have hesitated to kill Jews if they had nothing to gain.</i>— And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows. And You made a miracle and a wonder for them, and we are thankful to Your great name forever.  
And for all the foregoing may Your Name, our King, constantly be blessed and extolled, forever and ever.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</i> Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.
<i>If you forget to say this, you need not go back and repeat it. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</i>
And all the living shall thank You forever and praise Your Name with sincerity — the Almighty, Who is our deliverance and our help forever. Blessed are You, Adonoy; Your Name is The Beneficent and You it is fitting to praise.

Peace

Bestow abundant peace upon Israel, Your people, forever. For You are King, the Master of all peace. And may it be good in Your sight to bless us and to bless Your people Israel, at all times and at every moment with Your peace.
<i>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</i> May we be remembered and inscribed before You in the book of life, blessing, peace and abundant maintenance; we and all Your people, the House of Israel, for a good life and peace.
<i>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who blesses His people Israel with peace.

He who dwells in the shelter of the Supreme One, under the protection of Shadai he will abide. I say of Adonoy, [He is] my refuge and my stronghold, my God in Whom I trust. For He will save you from the snare-trap, from destructive pestilence. With His wings He will cover you and beneath His wings, you will find refuge; His truth is a shield, a full shield. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day. The pestilence that prowls in darkness, nor the deadly plague that ravages at noon. A thousand will fall at your [left] side, and ten thousand at your [right] side but it shall not come near you. Only with your eyes will you behold and see the punishment of the wicked. For you [have proclaimed]: “Adonoy is my refuge,” the Supreme One you have made your dwelling. No evil shall befall you, and no plague shall come near your tent. For His angels He will command on your behalf— to guard you in all your ways. They will carry you upon their hands, lest you hurt your foot on a rock. You will tread upon lion and snake, you will trample young lion and serpent. Because he clings to Me with desire, I will save him; I will strengthen him, for he knows My Name. When he calls upon Me, I will answer him; I am with him in distress, I will free him and honor him. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance.

Veyiten Lekha



Sefirat HaOmer

<i>The Omer is counted from the second night of Pesach until the night before Shavuos. The counting of forty-nine days (seven weeks) between the Festival of Pesach and Shavuos (the Feast of Weeks), connects the exodus from Egypt with the festival of the giving of the Torah. Just as one who awaits a most intimate friend on a certain day counts the days in eager anticipation of his arrival, so do we count the days from our liberation till the day we receive the Torah, which is the culmination and fulfillment of our freedom. It is proper to count the Omer at the beginning of the night, usually after the Maariv Service, and the Omer should be counted while standing.</i>

I am prepared and ready to perform the affirmative command to count the Omer, as is written in the Torah: “And you shall count for yourselves, from the day after the day of rest, from the day you bring the <i>omer</i> as the wave-offering, seven complete weeks shall there be; until the day following the seventh week shall you count fifty days; and you shall bring a new meal-offering unto Adonoy.” Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to count the Omer. 
May the pleasantness of my Master our God be upon us, and the work of our hands established for us, and the work of our hands—establish it.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to count the Omer.

















































The Merciful One, may He return for us the service of the Beis Hamikdash in its place speedily in our days, Amein, <i>Selah.</i>
To Him, Who grants victory:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 67 is recited because the seven verses which follow the introductory verse contain 49 words corresponding to the seven weeks (49 days) that link Pesach to the giving of the Torah on Shavuos.</i> a psalm with instrumental music, a song. [May] God favor us and bless us, [may He] cause His countenance to shine among us forever; [so] that Your way become known on earth, [and] Your deliverance among all nations. Peoples will thank You, God, all the peoples will thank You. Nations will rejoice and sing when You judge the peoples justly, and lead the nations upon the earth forever. Peoples will thank You, God, all the peoples will thank You. The earth will have yielded its produce; God, our God, will have blessed us. God will bless us, and they will fear Him— all [men even from] the ends of the earth.
Please, by the force of Your great right hand, release the bound one.
Accept the prayer of Your people; strengthen us, purify us, awesome One!
Please mighty One— those who seek Your unity— preserve them like the apple [of Your eye.]
Bless them, purify them, have mercy on them; Your benevolent righteousness [may You] always bestow upon them.
Mighty, Holy One in Your abundant goodness lead Your community.
Unique One, Exalted, turn to Your people who are mindful of Your holiness.
Accept our prayer and hear our cry, [You] Who knows hidden thoughts.
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious Kingdom is forever and ever.
Master of the universe, You commanded us through the hands of Your servant, Moses, to count the Omer in order to purify us from our evil and defilement. As You have written in Your Torah: And you shall count for yourselves, from the day after the day of rest, from the day you bring the <i>omer</i> as the wave-offering, seven complete weeks, shall there be; until the day following the seventh week shall you count fifty days, in order to cleanse the souls of Your people Israel from their impurities. Therefore, may it be Your will, Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, that in the merit of the Omer which I counted today, may any defect I have caused be rectified. May I be purified and sanctified with sublime holiness, and thereby may abundant bounty be bestowed upon all the worlds. May it rectify our being, our spirit and our souls from every baseness and defect, and may it purify us and sanctify us with Your sublime holiness. Amen, Selah.

It is our obligation to praise the Master of all, to ascribe greatness to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning: that He has not made us like the nations of the lands, and has not positioned us like the families of the earth; that He has not assigned our portion like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitudes. For they prostrate themselves to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot deliver. But we bow, prostrate ourselves, and offer thanks before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One blessed is He, Who spreads the heavens, and establishes the earth, and the seat of His glory is in heaven above, and the abode of His invincible might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God, there is nothing else.

LeDavid

<i>The following psalm (27) is recited at the conclusion of services, morning and evenings, from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres. Others say only until Hoasha’na Rabbah. The psalm voices our prayer that God will be our light on Rosh Hashana enabling us to repel the darkness of sin through true repentance, and that He will be our salvation on Yom Kippur, through His compassionate atonement of our sins.</i>

<i>This prayer is customarily recited in the open air, in clear sight of the moon, seven days after the birth of the new moon.</i>
Praise God. Praise Adonoy from the sky, praise Him in the heavens! Praise Him all His angels, praise Him all His hosts! Praise Him sun and moon; praise Him all the stars of light. Praise Him skies of skies and the waters that are above the skies. They will praise the Name of Adonoy, for He commanded and they were created.

I hereby forgive anyone who has angered me, or sinned against me, either physically or financially, against my honor or anything that is mine, whether accidentally or intentionally, inadvertently or deliberately, by speech or by deed, by thought or by speculation, in this incarnation or in any other: any Israelite [is forgiven], may no man be punished on my account. May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers, that I shall sin no more nor repeat my sins, neither shall I again anger You nor do what is wrong in Your eyes. The sins I have committed, erase in your abounding mercies, but not through suffering or severe illnesses. May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be acceptable before You Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, Who causes the fetters of sleep to fall upon my eyes, and slumber upon my eyelids. May it be Your will, Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers to make me lie down in peace, and to raise me (again) to peace. Let my thoughts not terrify me— nor evil dreams or evil fancies (disturb me), and may my bed be perfect before You. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word “bed” is used here figuratively for one’s future generations.

Almighty, faithful King
Hear, Israel Adonoy is our God Adonoy is One
<i>The following three lines are to be said silently:</i>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious Kingdom is forever and ever.
And you shall love Adonoy, your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your possessions. And these words which I command you today shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them sharply to your children, and you shall discuss them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways.
And it will be— if you vigilantly obey My commandments which I command you this day, to love Adonoy your God, and serve Him with your entire hearts and with your entire souls— that I will give rain for your land in its proper time, the early (autumn) rain and the late (spring) rain; and you will harvest your grain and your wine and your oil. And I will put grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. Beware lest your hearts be swayed and you turn astray, and you worship alien gods and bow to them. And Adonoy’s fury will blaze among you, and He will close off the heavens and there will be no rain and the earth will not yield its produce; and you will perish swiftly from the good land which Adonoy gives you. Place these words of Mine upon your hearts and upon your souls,— and bind them for a sign upon your hands, and they shall be for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes. And you shall teach them to your sons, to speak them when you sit in your house, and when you travel on the road, and when you lie down and when you rise. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gateways. In order that your days be prolonged, and the days of your children, upon the land which Adonoy swore to your fathers to give them [for as long] as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations; and they will place with the fringes of each corner a thread of blue. And it will be to you for fringes, and you will look upon it and you will remember all the commandments of Adonoy, and you will perform them; and you will not turn aside after your hearts and after your eyes which cause you to go astray. In order that you will remember and perform all My commandments; and you will be holy unto your God. I am Adonoy, your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am Adonoy, your God—is true—
May the pleasantness of my Master, our God, be upon us,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In this closing sentence of Psalm 90, Moses prays that the Divine Presence rest on the Jewish nation exclusively.</i> and the work<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">David prays first that the service Jewry performs in the Sanctuary, the sacrificial offerings, and the general performance of <i>mitzvos</i> be willingly accepted by God.

He who dwells in the shelter of the Supreme One, under the protection of Shadai He will abide. I say of Adonoy, [He is] my refuge and my stronghold, my God in Whom I trust. For He will save you from the snare-trap, from destructive pestilence. With His wings He will cover you and beneath His wings, you will find refuge; His truth is a shield, a full shield. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, the pestilence that prowls in darkness, nor the deadly plague that ravages at noon. A thousand will fall at your [left] side, and ten thousand at your [right] side but it<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“It” refers to “arrow,” “pestilence,” and “plague” of the previous verse.</i> shall not come near you.

For His angels He will command on your behalf— to guard you in all your ways. They will carry you upon their hands, lest you hurt your foot on a rock. You will tread upon lion and snake, you will trample young lion and serpent. Because he clings to Me with desire, I will save him; I will strengthen him, for he knows My Name. When he calls upon Me, I will answer him; I am with him in distress, I will free him and honor him. I will satiate him with longevity, and will let him see My deliverance. I will satiate him with longevity and will let him see My deliverance.
Adonoy, how many are my tormentors;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 3 was sung by David when, at the age of 65, he had to flee his son Absalom.</i> many rise up against me. Many say of my soul: There is no deliverance for him through God, forever. But You, Adonoy, are a shield for me; my glory and Raiser of my head. With my voice, I call out to Adonoy, and He answers me from His holy mountain, forever. I lay down and slept; I awake for Adonoy supports me. I fear not the tens of thousands of people deployed against me from every side. Rise Adonoy, deliver me, my God, for You have struck all my enemies<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">David is confident of God’s help, because God has always smitten his enemies.—<i>Radak</i></i> on the cheek; You have broken the teeth of the wicked. Deliverance is Adonoy’s; upon Your people is Your blessing, <i>selah.</i>
Adonoy, our God, make us lie down in peace; our King, raise us [again] to life. Spread over us the shelter of Your peace, and direct us to better ourselves through Your good counsel; and deliver us for Your Name’s sake. Shield us, and remove from us enemies, pestilence, sword, famine and sorrow. Remove the adversary from before us and from behind us, and shelter us in the shadow of Your wings. For You are the Almighty Who is our protector and rescuer. For You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful. Guard our going out and our coming in for life and peace from now, forever.
Blessed is Adonoy by day, Blessed is Adonoy by night. Blessed is Adonoy when we lie down Blessed is Adonoy when we rise. For in Your hand are the souls of the living and the dead, (as it is written): For in His hand is the soul of every living thing and the spirit of every human being. In Your hand, I commit my spirit; You have liberated me, Adonoy, Almighty of truth. Our God in heaven, reveal the unity of Your Name, preserve Your kingdom always, and reign over us forever and ever.
May our eyes behold, may our heart rejoice and our soul exalt in Your true deliverance, when it will be said to Zion: Your God has begun His reign Adonoy is King, Adonoy was King, Adonoy will reign forever and ever For the Kingdom is Yours and to all eternity, You will reign in glory, for we have no king except You.

And He said, “If you will diligently heed the voice of Adonoy, your God, and do what is upright in His eyes, and listen carefully to His commandments, and guard all His statutes— [then] every sickness that I put in Egypt, I will not put upon you, for I am Adonoy, your Healer.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 15:26</i>

He was, He is, and He shall be in glory.
He is One, and there is no second to compare to Him, to associate [with Him].
Without beginning, without end, power and dominion are His.
He is my God and my ever-living Redeemer, the Rock of my destiny on the day of distress.
He is my flag and my refuge; He is the portion of my cup on the day I call.
Into His hand I entrust my spirit [both] when I sleep and when I awaken.
And with my spirit my body [too], Adonoy is with me, I shall not fear.

Yedid Nefesh

Beloved of my soul, compassionate Father, draw me, your servant, to your desire.  Would that I could run like a gazelle, and bow before Your beauty, for I find your love sweeter than honey or any delight.
Beautiful, splendrous light of the world, my soul is sick with love.  God, please heal her by bathing her in your serene light -- then she shall surely be strengthened and healed and be Your servant forever.
Ancient One, let Your compassion flow.  Have pity on the child whom You love -- for I have yearned so long to see your luminescent power.  My God, my beloved, hurry; please, do not hide!
Please, my beloved, reveal Yourself.  Spread the sukkah of your love over me.  May the whole world be illuminated with Your glory; then shall we be glad and rejoice with You.  My lover -- come quickly, for the time has come -- have compassion for me as in days of old.


Psalm 95


Come, let us sing to YHVH, and shout for joy to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us come into YHVH’s presence with thanks; let us shout for joy to YHVH with song. For YHVH is a great god, and a great majesty above all gods. In God’s hands are the depths of the earth, and the peaks of the mountains are God’s. The sea is God’s, for God made it; and God’s hands shaped the dry land. Come, let us bow down and bend the knee; let us kneel before YHVH our maker, For YHVH is our god, and we are the people that God shepherds, the flock of God’s hand. Today, if you would but listen to God’s voice! Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as on the day of Massah, in the wilderness; When your ancestors tested and tried Me, even though they saw My work. For forty years, I was weary with that generation and said: This is a people confused at heart, that do not know My ways. For that reason, I swore in My anger, that they would never enter My resting place. 

Psalm 96

 Sing to YHVH a new song; sing to YHVH, all the earth. Sing to YHVH, bless God’s name; proclaim God’s deliverance day after day. Tell of God’s glory among the nations, God’s wonderful acts among all peoples. For YHVH is great and highly praised; awesome is God, above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are only idols, but YHVH made the heavens. Honor and majesty in God’s presence; strength and beauty in God’s sanctuary. Grant to YHVH, O families of peoples, grant to YHVH glory and strength. Grant to YHVH the glory due God’s name; bring an offering, and come into God’s courts. Bow down to YHVH in the beauty of holiness; tremble in God’s presence, all the earth. Say among the nations: “YHVH reigns.” The earth holds firm and cannot be shaken; God judges the peoples with fairness. Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all within it and all within it. Let the field exult, and all inside it. Then all the trees of the wood will shout for joy before YHVH, who is coming. For God is coming to judge the earth; God will judge the earth with righteousness and the peoples with God’s faithfulness. 

Psalm 97

Amikor az Örökkévaló uralkodik majd, ujjong a föld, ünnepel a sok sziget! Felhő és sűrű sötétség veszi Őt körül, jog és igazság trónjának támasza. Tűz lobog előtte, s megemészti ellenségeit körös-körül. Villámai megvilágítják a világot, a föld látni fogja és megremeg. A hegyek elolvadnak, mint a viasz, az Örökkévaló, világ urának tekintete előtt. Az egek hirdetik majd igazságosságát, és a népek látják majd dicsőségét. Szégyenben maradnak majd a bálványok imádói, akik hiábavaló istenekkel dicsekszenek; a hatalmasságok mind térdre hullnak előtte. Cion hallja majd, és vigad; Júda leányai ujjonganak ítéleteid miatt, Örökkévaló. Mert Te vagy, Örökkévaló, a legfelsőbb az egész föld felett, messze fönségesebb minden hatalmasságnál. Akik szeretik az Örökkévalót: gyűlöljétek a rosszat! Őrzi a jámborok lelkét, megmenti őket a gonoszok kezétől. Fény ragyog fel az igaznak, és öröm a becsületes szívűeknek. Örüljetek igazak az Örökkévalóban, és adjatok hálát szent nevének említésekor!

Psalm 98

Zsoltár: Énekeljetek új dalt az Örökkévalónak, mert csodákat művelt, saját jobbja és szent karja segítette. Az Örökkévaló kinyilvánította megváltását, igazságosságát feltárta a népek szeme előtt. Megemlékezett jóságáról és hűségéről Izrael háza iránt; a föld minden határa látta Istenünk megváltását. Ujjongjon az Örökkévalónak a föld minden népe; nyissátok ajkaitokat öröménekre és vigadásra! Zenéljetek az Örökkévalónak hárfával; hárfával és dicsőítés dalával! Trombita és kürt hangjával ujjongjatok a Király, az Örökkévaló előtt! Harsog majd a tenger és ami betölti, a világ és lakói. Folyók tapsolnak majd kezeikkel, a hegyek együtt ujjonganak majd. Az Örökkévaló előtt, mert jön, hogy ítélkezzen a föld felett; igazságosan fog bíráskodni a világ felett, és méltányosan a népek felett.

Psalm 99

Amikor az Örökkévaló uralkodik majd, a népek reszketni fognak; a föld megremeg előtte, ki a kerubokon trónol. Az Örökkévaló előtt, aki Cion nagyja, aki fönséges minden nép felett. Dicsőítik majd nagy és félelmetes neved, mert szent az! Hatalmas a Király, aki az igazságosságot szereti. Te tetted le a méltányosság alapját; Te alkottad Jákob jogosságát és igazságosságát. Magasztaljátok az Örökkévalót, Istenünket, hajtsatok térdet zsámolya előtt; szent Ő! Mózes és Áron a papjai közt, és Sámuel azok közt, akik az Ő nevét hívják: hívták az Örökkévalót, és Ő válaszolt nekik. A felhőoszlopból beszélt hozzájuk; engedelmeskedtek tanúságának és minden rendeletnek, amit nekik adott. Örökkévaló, Istenünk, Te feleltél nekik; kegyelmes Isten voltál hozzájuk, büntetője vétkeiknek. Magasztaljátok az Örökkévalót, Istenünket, boruljatok le szent hegyén, mert szent az Örökkévaló, a mi Istenünk.

Psalm 29

Dávid zsoltára. Adjátok meg az Örökkévalónak, hatalmasságok gyermekei; adjátok meg az Örökkévalónak a tiszteletet és a hatalmat! Adjátok meg az Örökkévalónak nevéhez illő dicsőséget, boruljatok le az Örökkévaló előtt szentségének helyén! Az Örökkévaló hangja a vizek fölött van, a Dicsőséges Isten mennydörög; az Örökkévaló a hatalmas vizek fölött van. Az Örökkévaló hangja hatalmas, az Örökkévaló hangja fenséges. Az Örökkévaló hangja cédrusokat tör; az Örökkévaló összezúzza Libanon cédrusait. Táncoltatja, mint valami borjút; Libanont és Szirjont, mint fiatal bivalyokat. Az Örökkévaló hangja tűznek lángjával hasít; az Örökkévaló hangja megremegteti a pusztát, az Örökkévaló megremegteti Kádés pusztáját. Az Örökkévaló hangja megrémiszti a szarvasokat, megritkítja az erdőket; míg Szentélyében mindenki azt hirdeti: dicsőség! Az Örökkévaló trónolt az özönvíz felett, az Örökkévaló királyként trónol mindörökké. Az Örökkévaló erőt ad majd népének, az Örökkévaló békével áldja meg majd népét.

Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
"Observe" and "Remember" in one utterance. The One and Only God allowed us to hear.    God is one and His name is one. For renown and for glory and for praise. 
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
Let us go to welcome the Shabbat. For she is the source of blessing. From the very start, from the beginning she was designated. The end of creation and first in thought. 
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
Sanctuary of the King, city of royalty. Rise and go forth from the ruins. Too long have you sat in the valley sorrow. And He will shower you with compassion. ...
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat....
Shake it all off, rise from the ashes. Wear the garments of the glory of My people. Through the son of Jesse of Bethlehem. Draw close to my soul and redeem it. 
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
Wake up, wake up. For your light has come, rise and illuminate. Arise, arise, speak a song. The honor of God is revealed upon you. 
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
Do not be ashamed nor confounded. Why should you be downtrodden and why should you be shocked? Within you the afflicted of My people will seek refuge. And the city will be rebuilt on its former site. ...
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
And your oppressors will be destroyed. And those who would devour you will be far away. Your God will rejoice over you. Like a bridegroom rejoices over his bride. 
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
Right and left you will proliferate. And you will worship God. Through the man who descends from Peretz. And we shall celebrate and rejoice. 
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
Come in peace, crown of her husband. With both joy and fanfare. Among the faithful, the virtuous people. Come O bride. Come O bride. 
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.

Psalm 92

Zsoltár a Sábbát napjára. Jó hálát adni az Örökkévalónak, dícséretet énekelni nevednek, Magasságos, hirdetni reggel jótetteidet, éjszaka meg hűségedet. Tízhúrúval és lanttal, énekkel és hárfával. Mert megörvendeztettél tetteiddel, Örökkévaló; öröméneket zengek kezed munkája láttán. Milyen hatalmasak a tetteid, Örökkévaló; milyen mélyek gondolataid! Az értelmetlen ember nem értheti, a balga nem foghatja fel soha: mikor a bűnösök növekednek, mint a fű, a gonosztevők meg virágzanak – hogy örökre elpusztuljanak. De Te fenséges maradsz mindörökké, Örökkévaló. Lásd, ellenségeid, Örökkévaló, elpusztulnak mind, a gonosztevők mind szertefoszlanak. De büszkeségemet felemeled, mint bivalyt, és átitatsz színtiszta olajjal. Szemeim látták szemfüles ellenségeimet; fülem meghallja a nekem ártókat, mikor felkelnek ellenem. Az igaz ember kivirágzik majd, mint a pálma; magasra nő, mint a libanoni cédrus. Az Örökkévaló házában vannak elültetve, Istenünk csarnokában kivirágzanak. Még öregkorukban is gyümölcsöt teremnek, életerősek és frissek lesznek – hogy hirdessék: az Örökkévaló igazságos, ő az én Sziklám, hamisság nincsen benne.

Psalm 93

Amikor az Örökkévaló uralkodik, fenségbe öltözik majd; az Örökkévaló erőbe öltözik, és hatalommal övezi fel magát; még szilárd alapot is vet, nehogy meginogjon a világ. Trónod a régi idők óta áll; Te vagy öröktől fogva. Mint a folyók emelkednek, Örökkévaló, mint a folyók, úgy emelték fel hangjukat; mint a folyók, úgy emelkedett ártalmasságuk. Hatalmasabb a rengeteg víz zúgásánál; hatalmasabb, mint a tenger hullámai – Te mindennél hatalmasabb vagy a magasságokban, Örökkévaló. Bizonyítékaid valóban igazak Szent Házadat illetően; Örökkévaló, legyen úgy hosszú időre!

Bameh Madlikin

Mivel gyújthatunk szombati gyertyát és mivel nem? Nem használunk kanócnak cédrust, fésületlen lent, selymet, fűzt, sivatagi selymet vagy hínárt. Nem használunk égő anyagnak viaszt, gyapotolajat, [vallási okból] elégetendő olajat, farzsírt vagy faggyút. Médeai Náchum azt mondja: gyújthatunk főtt faggyúval. De a Bölcsek azt mondják: se főtt, se főzetlen faggyúval.
Nem használunk [vallási okból] elégetendő olajat ünnepnapon. Rabbi Jismáél azt mondja: nem gyújtunk kátránnyal a Sábbát tisztelete miatt. De a Bölcsek megengednek minden típusú olajat: szezámmag-olajat, mogyoróolajat, retekolajat, halolajat, tökolajat, kátrányt, naftát. Rabbi Tárfon azt mondja: csakis olivaolajjal gyújthatunk.
Nem gyújthatunk semmilyen fából származó kanóccal, kivéve a lent. Ezen felül semmilyen fából készült termék nem válik rituálisan tiszátalanná, ha egy fedél alá kerül egy tisztátalan tárggyal; kivéve a lent. Ruhából készült kanóccal, melyet már befontak, de még nem perzseltek meg – Rabbi Eliezer szerint rituálisan tisztátalan, és nem gyújthatunk vele; Rabbi Akiva szerint rituálisan tiszta, és gyújthatunk vele.
Nem használhatunk tojásból készült tartót, melyet kilyukasztunk alul, és teletöltjük, hogy az olaj a lámpásba csöpögjön belőle, még akkor sem megengedett, ha ez agyagból van. Ha viszont a fazekas odaragasztva készítette, szabad, mert egy edénynek számít. Nem tölthetünk meg egy tálat olajjal, hogy a lámpás mellé tegyük, és belehelyezzük a kanóc végét, mert átszívja az olajat. De Rabbi Jehuda szerint szabad.
Aki azért oltja el a fényt, mert fél a bálványimádóktól, rablóktól, melankóliától; vagy azért, hogy a beteg aludni tudjon, mentesül a büntetés alól. De ha csak azért, hogy spóroljon a fénnyel, a lámpával, az olajjal vagy a kanóccal, megbüntetik. Rabbi Joszi szerint csak akkor büntetjük meg, ha a kanóccal akar spórolni, mert akkor szenet készít.
Három vétek miatt halnak bele a nők a szülésbe: mert nem eléggé elővigyázatosak a házasélet tisztaságának törvényeinek betartásánál, a chala elvételénél, és a sábbáti gyertyák meggyújtásánál.
Három dolgot kell megemlíteni otthon a Sábbát bejövetele előtt: 1. Vettünk-e tizedet? 2. Csináltunk-e éruvot? 3. Gyújtsuk meg a sábbáti gyertyákat! Ha kérdéses, hogy a Sábbát bejött-e már, nem szabad tizedet venni a biztosan nem tizedet vett terményekből, az edényeket mikvébe meríteni, vagy gyertyát gyújtani. De szabad tizedet venni azokból a termékekből, ahol kérdéses, hogy vettünk-e tizedet, szabad éruvot csinálni, és betakarni a meleg ételt.
Bölcseink tanították, hogy Chánánja azt mondja: kötelessége az embernek ellenőriznie ruháit a Sábbát bejövetele előtt, nehogy benne felejtsen valamit, és kivigye azt közterületre. Ráv Joszéf azt mondta: ez a Sábbát napjának egyik fontos törvénye.
Rabbi Elázár mondta Rabbi Chanina nevében: a Tóratudósok gyarapítják a békét a világban, ahogy írva van: „Minden gyermeked az Örökkévaló tanítványa lesz, és gyermekeidnek nagy békében lesz része.” Ne úgy olvasd, hogy gyermekeid (bánájich), hanem úgy, hogy építőid (bonájich). Nagy béke van a Tórádat szeretőkkel, és nincs előttük gáncs. Legyen béke falaidon belül, és nyugalom palotáidon belül. Testvéreim és társaim kedvéért hadd beszéljek békéről benned. Az Örökkévaló, Istenünk háza kedvéért hadd kérjek neked jót. Az Örökkévaló adjon erőt népének; az Örökkévaló áldja meg népét békével.

Blessings of the Shema

First Blessing before Shema

Áldott vagy, Örökkévaló, Istenünk, a világ királya, aki szavával hozza el az estét, bölcsen kapukat nyit, értelemmel változtatja az időket, fordítja az évszakokat, és rendezi a csillagokat és égi képeiket, akarata szerint. Nappalt és éjszakát teremt, eltávolítja a fényt a sötétség elől, és a sötétséget a fény elől. Ő múlatja el a napot, és hozza az éjt, Ő választja el a nappalt az éjszakától – Örökkévaló, a Seregek Ura az Ő neve. Uralkodjon felettünk az Élő Isten mindörökké! Áldott vagy, Örökkévaló, aki elhozza az estét.

Second Blessing before Shema

Végtelen szeretettel szeretted néped, Izrael házát, és tanítottál bennünket a Tórára és a micvákra, a rendeletekre és törvényekre. Ezért, Örökkévaló, Istenünk, rendeleteidről beszélünk, mikor lefekszünk és felkelünk, és örvendünk Tórád és micváid szavai felett mindörökké. Mert ezek a mi életünk és napjaink meghosszabbítói, és velük kell foglalatoskodnunk nappal és éjjel. Ne vedd el soha tőlünk szeretetedet! Áldott vagy, Örökkévaló, aki szereti népét, Izraelt.

Shema

Isten, igazságos király.
Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One.
Halkan hozzátesszük: Áldott dicsőséges uralkodásának neve örökkön örökké!
Szeresd az Örökkévalót, Istenedet teljes szívedből, teljes lelkedből és teljes erőddel. És legyenek ezek a szavak, melyeket megparancsolok ma neked, a szíveden. Tanítsd azokat fiaidnak, és beszélj róluk, mikor házadban ülsz, mikor utadon jársz, és mikor lefekszel és felkelsz. Kösd jelül őket kezedre, és legyenek homlokkötőként szemeid közt; és írd fel azokat házad ajtófélfáira és kapuidra.
És lesz majd, ha folyamatosan hallgattok rendeleteimre, melyeket ma megparancsolok nektek, hogy szeressétek az Örökkévalót, Isteneteket, és szolgáljátok Őt teljes szívetekkel és lelketekkel. És akkor esőt adok földetekre a megfelelő évszakban, korai és kései esőt, hogy begyűjtsétek gabonátokat, szőlőtöket és olajatokat. És adok füvet állataitoknak mezőiteken; enni fogtok, és jóllaktok. Vigyázzatok, nehogy eltévelyedjen szívetek, és elforduljatok tőlem, és más istenségeket szolgáljatok, és előttük leboruljatok. Mert felkel veled szemben az Örökkévaló haragja, és elzárja az eget, hogy ne essen eső, és a föld ne adjon termést, és gyorsan elűzzön arról a jó földről, amit az Örökkévaló ad neked. Vegyétek ezeket a szavakat szívetekre és lelketekre, és kössétek jelül őket kezeitekre, és legyenek homlokkötőként szemeitek közt. Tanítsd meg fiaidnak, hogy beszéljen róluk; mikor házadban ülsz, mikor utadon jársz, és mikor lefekszel és felkelsz. És írd fel azokat házad ajtófélfáira és kapuidra, hogy megsokasodjanak napjaitok, és gyermekeitek napjai azon a földön, melyről megesküdött az Örökkévaló őseiteknek, hogy nekik adja azt; mint az ég napjai a földön.
És szólt az Örökkévaló Mózeshez, mondván: beszélj Izrael fiaihoz, és mondd nekik, hogy készítsenek maguknak ciceszt ruháik sarkaira, nemzedékeiken át, és helyezzenek a sarok ciceszére techélet-kék fonalat. Legyen az számotokra cicesz, lássátok azt, és emlékezzetek az Örökkévaló összes törvényére; tartsátok be azokat, és ne kutassatok szívetek és szemeitek nyomán, melyek után eltévelyedtek; hogy emlékezzetek és tartsátok meg összes törvényemet, és legyetek szentek Isteneteknek. Én vagyok az Örökkévaló, a ti Istenetek, aki kivezetett benneteket Egyiptom földjéről, hogy a ti Istenetek legyen. Én vagyok az Örökkévaló, a ti Istenetek. Igaz –
Az előimádkozó megismétli az utolsó három szót: Az Örökkévaló, Istenetek. Igaz –

First Blessing after Shema

– és hiteles mindez, és szilárd számunkra, hogy Ő az Örökkévaló, Istenünk, rajta kívül nincs más. Mi pedig az Ő népe, Izrael vagyunk. Ő mentett meg bennünket királyok kezeitől; Királyunk Ő, aki minden zsarnok kezéből megszabadít bennünket. Ő az Isten, aki szenvedéseinket megtorolja, és igazságosan bünteti meg az életünkre törőket. Hatalmas dolgokat tesz, mely felülmúlja az értelmet, és megszámlálhatatlan sok csodát művel.
Ő helyezte lelkünket az életbe, és nem hagyta lábainkat botladozni. Átvezetett bennünket ellenségeink magaslatain, és felemelte büszkeségünket a minket gyűlölők fölé. Csodákat tett velünk, és elégtételt vett a Fáraón; jeleket és csodás dolgokat tett velünk Chám földjén.
Haragjában leverte Egyiptom összes elsőszülöttjét, és kivezette közülük népét, Izraelt, az örök szabadságba. Átvezette népét a kettéválasztott Nádas-tengeren, az őket üldözőket és gyűlölőket pedig a mélységbe vetette. Mikor gyermekei látták hatalmát, magasztalták, és hálát adtak Neki, uralmát boldogan elfogadták. Mózes és Izrael gyermekei dallal kiáltottak Hozzád, hatalmas boldogságban, és együtt mondták:
„Ki hasonló Hozzád a hatalmasok között? Ki olyan, mint Te, nagy a szentségben, félelmetes dicsőségben, csodákat tevő?”
Fiaid látták királyságodat, mikor kettéválasztottad a tengert Mózes előtt. „Ez az én Istenem”, kiáltották, és azt mondták: „Az Örökkévaló uralkodik örökkön örökké!” És írva van: „Mert megváltotta az Örökkévaló Jákobot, és megszabadította az erősebb kezéből”. Áldott vagy, Örökkévaló, aki megváltotta Izraelt.

Second Blessing after Shema

Help us, Lord, to lie down in peace, and awaken us again, our Sovereign, to life.  Spread over us Your shelter of peace; guide us with Your good counsel.  Save us because of Your mercy.  Shield us from enemies and plague, from starvation, sword, and sorrow.  Remove the evil forces that surround us.  Shelter us in the shadow of Your wings, O G-d, who watches over us and delivers us, our gracious and merciful Ruler.  Guard our coming and our going; grant us life and peace, now and always.  Spread over us the shelter of Your peace.  Praised are you, Lord, who spreads the shelter of peace over us, over all G-d's people Israel, and over Jerusalem.

Sanctity of the Day

Te szentelted meg a hetedik napot a nevednek, az ég és föld teremtésének befejeztét; megáldottad azt az összes többi nap közül, és megszentelted azt minden idők közül, ahogy írva van a Tórádban:
És elkészült az ég, a föld és minden seregük. Befejezte Isten a hetedik napon művét, melyet alkotott, és megpihent a hetedik napon minden művétől, melyet alkotott. Ekkor megáldotta Isten a hetedik napot, és megszentelte, mert azon a napon pihent meg minden művétől, amit teremtett Isten, és alkotott.
Istenünk, ősatyáink Istene, legyen kedves Számodra [sábbáti] pihenésünk. Szentelj meg bennünket parancsolataiddal, és adj részt nekünk Tórádban. Adj nekünk megelégedést jóságodból, örvendeztess meg minket megváltásoddal, és tisztítsd meg szívünket, hogy őszintén szolgáljunk téged. Örökkévaló, Istenünk, add nekünk örökségként a szent Sábbátot, szeretettel és jóindulattal, és hadd pihenjen meg ezen a napon Izrael népe, neved megszentelője.

Örökkévaló, Istenünk, legyen néped, Izrael, és annak imái kedvesek Számodra, és állítsd vissza a szolgálatot és Izrael égőáldozatait Szentélyedbe. Imáikat pedig fogadd szeretettel és keggyel, és mindig legyen Számodra kedves néped, Izrael szolgálata.
Ros Chódeskor, valamint Szukot és Pészách félünnepén a következőt tesszük hozzá: Istenünk, ősatyáink Istene, emlékezz meg rólunk, elődeinkről, a Messiásról, Dávid szolgád fiáról, Jeruzsálemről, szent városodról, és Izrael egész háza népéről, szálljon és érkezzen Eléd mindezen emlékezet, érjen el Hozzád, fogadtassék el, és hallgattassék meg Előtted. És emlékezz meg róluk, hogy megszabadítsd őket, és jólétben legyenek, kegyben, jóságban és irgalomban részesüljenek, életben és békében, ezen a mai napon, [Újhold / a sátrak ünnepének / a kovásztalan kenyér ünnepének] alkalmából. Emlékezz meg rólunk a mai napon, Örökkévaló, Istenünk, a javunkra, megáldásunkra, és megtartásunkra az életben! A megmentés és irgalom tettével könyörülj rajtunk, légy hozzánk nagylelkű, irgalmazz nekünk és ments meg bennünket, mert szemeink Feléd fordulnak, és mert irgalmas és könyörületes uralkodó vagy. Lássák szemeink könyörületedben való visszatérésedet Cionba! Áldott vagy, Örökkévaló, akinek jelenléte visszatér Cionba.

Hálát adunk Neked, mert Te vagy az Örökkévaló, Istenünk, ősatyáink Istene, mindörökké. Te vagy életünk szirtje, megváltásunk pajzsa, nemzedékről nemzedékre. Köszönetet kell adnunk Neked és dicsőíteni téged, az életünkért és lelkünkért, mely a kezedben van; csodáidért, melyek nap mint nap velünk vannak; és állandó jóságodért, melyet velünk cselekszel este, reggel és nappal. Te vagy a Jó, mert könyörületed sohasem lankad; Te vagy a Könyörületes, mert jóságod végtelen; csak Benned van a reményünk.
Hálásak vagyunk Neked a csodákért és megszabadításokért, a hatalmas cselekedetekért, a győzelmekért és a háborúkért, melyeket őseinkért folytattál annak idején, az évnek ebben a szakaszában.
A hasmoneus Matitjáhu, Jochánán fia, a főpap és fiai napjaiban történt, hogy a gonosz görög birodalom népedet, Izraelt arra akarta kényszeríteni, hogy elfeledjék Tórádat, és eltávolodjanak akaratod törvényeitől. És akkor Te nagy irgalmadban kiálltál mellettük szenvedésük órájában, perbe szálltál értük, törvényt hoztál mellettük, bosszút álltál értük. A gyengék kezére adtad az erőseket, a kevesek kezére a sokakat, a tiszták kezére a tisztátalanokat, az igazak kezére a gonoszakat, a Tóráddal foglalatoskodók kezére a veled szembeszegülőket. Így tettél szert nagy és szent névre világodban; és népedért, Izraelért pedig nagy győzelmet arattál, és felszabadítottad ezen a napon. Ezután gyermekeid bementek házadba, kitakarították szent helyedet, megtisztították Szentélyedet, és gyertyákat gyújtottak szent udvarodban, és bevezették Chanuka ezen nyolc napját, hogy köszönetet mondjanak, és dicsőítsék nagy nevedet.

És mindezekért legyen áldott és magasztaltassék neved, Királyunk, örökkön örökké.
Írd be az Élet könyvébe mindazokat, akikkel szövetséget kötöttél! Minden élő Neked ad hálát örökké,
és őszintén dicsőítik nevedet, Isten, örök Megváltásunk és Segítőnk! Áldott vagy, Örökkévaló, akinek a neve Jó, és akinek helyénvaló köszönetet adni.

Nagy békét hozz népedre, Izraelre örökre, mert Te vagy a Király, minden béke Ura. Mert helyesnek tartod, hogy népedet, Izraelt minden időben és minden pillanatban megáldjad békéddel.

Áldott vagy, Örökkévaló, aki megáldja népét, Izraelt békével.
Találjanak kegyet Előtted ajkaim szólásai és szívem gondolatai, Örökkévaló, szirtem és megszabadítóm!

Concluding Passage

Istenem, óvd meg nyelvemet a rossztól, és ajkaimat a hamisságtól. Az engem átkozókkal szemben legyen lelkem néma; legyen lelkem mindenki előtt olyan, mint a por. Nyisd meg szívemet Tórád előtt, és parancsolataidra törekedjen lelkem! Mihamarabb tedd semissé tanácsait mindenkinek, aki ellenem gonoszul szövetkezik, és töröld el szándékaikat! Tedd meg mindezt nevedért, tedd meg jobbodért, tedd meg szentségedért, tedd meg Tórádért! Hogy a Számodra kedvesek megszabaduljanak; jobboddal ments meg, és felelj nekem! Találjanak kegyet Előtted ajkaim szólásai és szívem gondolatai, Örökkévaló, szirtem és megszabadítóm! Aki békét teremt a magasságokban, teremtsen békét számunkra, és egész Izrael számára, és mondjuk: Ámen.
Legyen az az akaratod, Örökkévaló, Istenünk, ősatyáink Istene, hogy épüljön fel a Szentély minél hamarabb, napjainkban, és add, hogy részünk legyen a Tórádban. Ott fogunk szolgálni téged istenfélelemmel eltelve, akárcsak hajdanában, a régi időkben. És akkor Júda és Jeruzsálem áldozatait kegyesen fogadja az Örökkévaló, akárcsak hajdanában, a régi időkben.

The community representative and the congregation say "And he completed"
And he completed the heavens and the earth and all their hosts. And God completed on the seventh day his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from the all his work which he had done. And God blessed the seventh day, and he sanctified it; for on it had God rested from all the work which he had created to do.

Me'ein Sheva

Blessed are you, O LORD our god and the god of our fathers, god of Abraham, god of Isaac, and god of Jacob, the great, mighty, and wondrous god, the god Most High, creator of the heavens and the earth.
Shield of the patriarchs with his Word, revivifier of the dead by his Speech, the holy god like whom there is none, who rests his people on his holy Sabbath day for on these did he please to rest them. We serve him in awe and fear, and give thanks to his name every day with appropriate blessings. God of thanks, master of peace, sanctifier of the Sabbath and blesser of the Seventh, who in holiness rests his people sated in enjoyment -- a memorial to Creation!
Our god and the god of our fathers, be pleased by our rest. Sanctify us by your commandments, and give us our portion in your Law. Sate us from your goodness, and cheer us with your salvation, and purify our hearts to serve you in truth. And endow to us, O Lord, in love and benevolence, your holy Sabbath, and rest thereon all Israel who sanctify your name. Blessed are you, O LORD, Sanctifier of the Sabbath.

Sefirat HaOmer



Aleinu

A mi kötelességünk magasztalni a Mindenség Urát, és nagyságát felismerni a Teremtés Megformálójának. Mert nem csak egy népnek teremtett bennünket a sok közül, és nem olyannak tett bennünket, mint a föld más nemzetségei. Mert nem ugyanazt adta osztályrészünkül, mint nekik, és jussunk nem olyan, mint az ő sokaságaiké. (Mert ők hiábavalóság és üresség előtt borulnak le, és olyan istenséghez imádkoznak, mely nem menti meg őket.) De mi a királyok királyainak Királya, a Szent – áldott Ő – előtt hajtunk térdet, borulunk le és mondunk köszönetet. Ő az, aki az égboltot kifeszíti és magalapozza a földet, hódolatának székhelye az egekben van fent, hatalmának jelenléte pedig a leghatalmasabb magasságokban. Igaz a mi Királyunk, nincs rajta kívül más! Ahogy Tórádban áll: „hogy megtudd ma, és szívedbe vésd, hogy az Örökkévaló az Isten, az egekben fent és a lent a földön, rajta kívül nincs más”.
Ezért mi Benned bízunk, Örökkévaló, Istenünk, hogy mihamarabb meglátjuk hatalmad dicsőségét, a bálványok eltávolítását a föld színéről és a hamis istenek eltörlését, és a világ helyrehozását a Mindenható királysága által. És akkor minden élő a Te nevedet hívja, hogy magadhoz fordítsd a föld minden gonoszát. Vegye észre, és tudja a világ minden lakója, hogy Előtted kell meghajolni minden térdnek, és Neked kell esküt tennie minden nyelvnek. Előtted borulnak majd le és hajolnak meg, és hódolnak majd neved dicsőségéhez; elfogadják mind királyságod jármát, Te pedig uralkodsz felettük, mihamarabb, örökké. Mert Tied a királyág, és dicsőséggel fogsz uralkodni örökkön örökké, ahogy a Tórádban áll: „Az Örökkévaló uralkodik örökkön örökké”. És ahogy az mondva van: „Az Örökkévaló lesz az egész föld Királya, – és azon a napon az Örökkévaló egy lesz, és neve is egy lesz”.

May God's great name be exalted and hallowed throughout the created world, as is God's wish.   May God's sovereignty soon be established, in your lifetime and in your days, and in the days of all the house of Israel.  And we say: Amen.

The king of the world, who ruled before any creature was created.
At the time they were made, all was according to His will, and then His name was called "King".
And after everything was finished, he alone ruled, awe-inspiring. 
He was, He is, and He will be with splendor.
And, he was first, with no second, to rule over him or to collaborate;
with no beginning and no end, he has the strength and the right.
And he is my G-d, my redeemer is alive; the rock who sustains me in a distressful day.
And he is my banner and refuge, the portion of my cup on the day I call out.
In his hand, I safeguard my spirit, [for] when I sleep, [I know that] I will wake.
And with my spirit is my body; G-d is for me, and I will not be afraid.

All who sanctify the Seventh as it deserves
All who protect the Sabbath according to its law from breakers
His reward is very great, correspondent to his act
Each according to his camp, each according to his flag.
God-lovers, who hope for the building of Ariel
On the Sabbath day they celebrate like those who received the gift of Nahaliel
Also their hands lift up the holy, and they say to God
"Blessed is the LORD who gave rest to his people Israel."
God-seekers, progeny of Abraham his beloved
Who delay leaving the Sabbath, and hurry to enter it
Who are happy to keep it, and to make its eruv,
"This is the day which the LORD made, let us celebrate on it!"
Recall the Law of Moses, which records the Sabbath commandment!
Set for the seventh day, like a bride arranged between her maids,
The pure ones inherit her, and sanctify her by retelling all which she did.
"And God completed on the seventh day the work which he did."
A holy day is it, from its coming to its departure
All progeny of Jacob will glorify it, per royal decree
to rest on it and to celebrate its pleasures, to eat and drink
"All the gathering of Israel will do this."
Disburse your kindness to those who know you, O jealous and vengeful god
Guards of the seventh day, who establish "Recall" and "Keep"
Celebrate in the building of Salem, make them shine with the radiance of your face,
"They will overflow with the abundance of your houses, and with your delicious spring you will water them."
Help those who rest on the seventh, planting and harvest, forever,
Taking a small step, eating so as to bless three times,
Their righteousness shines like the light of the seven days
"LORD god of Israel, give a sign!"
Sanctify them with you commandments, and make them as pure as the very sky
Let your spirit give them rest like a beast descending to the plain from a peak
Settle their tribes in the territory of the moon,
"Like groves they will spread, like gardens by the river."

O God, master of all creation/blessed by the mouth of every soul/whose grandeur and wonder existed before anything/knowledge and understanding surround his splendor. Who rides upon the holy chayos/and in glorious beauty upon the Chariot/merit and uprightness before his throne/charity and mercy filled with his glory. Good are the lamps which our god created/he made them with knowledge and understanding and skill/power and strength he gave to them/to rule in the vicinity of the Earth. Filled with shine and imbued with rays/lovely their shine throughout the world/happy in their rising and joyous in their setting/doing in awe the will of their creator. Wonder and glory they give to his name/joy and celebration to the stature of his kingship/He called out to the sun, and it shone with light/He saw, and fixed the shape of the moon. All the heavenly host gives him praise/ the seraphs and the ophans, wonder and grandeur.

Second Blessing before Shema

(1) [With] great love You have loved us, Lord, our God; [with] great and abundant compassion have You had compassion upon us. Our Parent, our Sovereign — for the sake of our ancestors who trusted in You, and whom You taught laws of life, so [too] be gracious to us and teach us. Our Parent, merciful Parent, Who acts with compassion, have compassion on us and put into our hearts [comprehension] to understand and to discern, to listen, to learn and to teach, to keep, to practice, and to fulfill all the words of the teachings in Your Torah with love. And enlighten our eyes with Your Torah, and attach our hearts to Your mitzvot, and unify our hearts to love and revere Your Name; and may we never be embarrassed, for in Your holy Name— [which is] great and awe-inspiring— have we trusted; may we delight and rejoice in Your deliverance. Bring us in peace [wholeness] from the four corners of the earth; and lead us upright to our land.

There is none like You among the gods, Adonai, and nothing like Your works. Your kingship is a kingship of all worlds, and Your reign is with generation upon generation. The Eternal rules. The Eternal has ruled. The Eternal will rule forever and ever. The Eternal will give strength to the Eternal's people. The Eternal will bless the Eternal's people with peace.

It happened upon the journeying of the Ark, Moses said, “Rise, Eternal,” and Your enemies were dispersed, and Your foes were put to flight from before You.

Avinu Shebashamim
Rock and Redeemer of Israel
Bless the State of Israel
The start of flowering of Redemption
Shield it with Your love
Spread over  it the shelter of Your peace
Guide its leaders and advisors with Your light and Your truth.  
Establish for them Your good counsel. 
Strengthen the hands of the defenders of our Holy Land
Cause them to inherit, our God, deliverance
Place the crown of victory upon them
Give the land peace
And everlasting joy to its inhabitants
And visit all our Brethren of the house of Israel,
in all the lands where they are scattered,
and bring them rapidly to Zion, Your city
and to Jerusalem, where Your name lives,
as it says in the Torah of Moses, Your servant:
Even if your dwelling is at the end of the sky,
G-d will congregate you from there,
and bring you from there, and will bring you toward the land that Your forefathers inherited and you will inherit it
and G-d shall benefit you and multiply your numbers greater than your forefathers. (Deut. 30)
Then the LORD your God will open up your heart and the hearts of your offspring
to love the LORD your God with all your heart and soul,
in order that you may live.
Unify our hearts to love and worship Your name
and to keep all that is in Your Torah,
and send us the son of David, the Messiah of Your justice,
to redeem those who wait for Your salvation.
Appear with the glory and the pride of Your strength,
in front of all the inhabitants of the Universe,
and all those who have breath will say:
The G-d of Israel is the King,
and He reigns over everything.
Amen, forever. 

Prayer for Israeli Soldiers

May He who blessed our fathers, Avraham, Yitschak and Yaakov

in their standing guard upon our land and the cities of our God
from the border of the Lebanon to the Wilderness of Egypt
and from the Great Sea to the approach of the Arava - on land, in the air, and in the sea.
May the Lord give our enemies that rise against us plagues in front of them.
May the Holy One, blessed be He, guard and rescue our soldiers from all trouble and distress and from all affliction and illness;
and send blessing and success in all the work of their hands.
May He crush those that hate us below them and crown them with the crown of salvation and with the wreath of victory.
And through them let the verse be fulfilled (Deuteronomy 20:4),
"For it is the Lord, your God, that walks with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you."
And let us say, Amen.

Guy ben Rina Chaver,
Ron ben Batya Arad,
Yekutiel Yehudah Nachman ben Sarah Katz

among others of our brethren of the House of Israel that are situated in distress and in captivity. On account of the congregation's praying for them, may the Holy One, blessed be He, grant mercy upon them, take them out from darkness and gloom, break their chains, redeem them from their ordeals and return them quickly to the comfort of their families. "Let them praise the Lord for His kindness, and His wondrous deeds for the children of man" (Psalms 107:8). And through them, let the verse (Isaiah 35:10) be fulfilled, "And the Lord’s ransomed shall return, and come with shouting to Zion, crowned with joy everlasting; they shall attain joy and gladness, while sorrow and sighing flee." And let us say, Amen!

Av HaRachamim


The merciful father who dwells upon high will mercifully judge the pious and the upright and pure, the holy congregations who gave up their lives in holy martyrship, who were loved and valued in their lives, and who in their deaths are not abandoned. [They were] lighter than eagles and mightier than lions in doing the will of their creator and the desire of their maker. Remember them for good, O our god, among all the world's righteous, and avenge the spilled blood of your servant, as it is said in the Torah of Moses, man-of-God, "Acclaim O nations his people, for the blood of his servants he will avenge, and vengeance will be repaid upon his enemies, and his army will cleanse his land." And upon the hands of his servants the Prophets it is written, "And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged; and the LORD dwells in Zion." And in the holy Writings it is said, "Why do the nations say, 'Where are their gods?' We will see the avengement of your servants' spilled blood made apparent to the nations." And it is said, "For the pursuer of blood will remember them; he will not forget the cries of the oppressed." And it is said, "He judges among the corpse-filled nations, head bowed over the great land. From a stream by the road he drinks -- only then does he lift his head!"

Therefore all people with their wine sanctify it

over two loaves the pure ones cut.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.


Eat fats, drink sweets,

For god will give to all who grasp him,

clothing to wear, bread of the laws,

meat and fish and all delicacies.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.



Do not deny yourself anything on it, and eat

and be satisfied and bless

the LORD your god which you love

for he has blessed you above all other nations.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.


The heavens tell his glory,

and also the land is filled with his charity

See that all this his hand made,

for he is the Rock, his act is perfect.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.

You are mighty forever, my Master; You are the Resurrector of the dead, the Powerful One, to deliver [us].

Sukkot

Prayers in the Sukkah

Entering the Sukkah

Behold, I am ready and prepared to fulfill the commandment of the sukkah (hut), as the Creator, may his Name be blessed, commanded me - as is written (Leviticus 23:43-44), "You shall live in huts seven days; all citizens in Israel shall live in huts.
In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelite people live in huts when I brought them out of the land of Egypt."

Ushpizin

Sit, sit, [you] lofty guests; sit, sit [you] holy guests; sit, sit [you] guests of faith. Worthy is Israel's portion, as it is written (Deuteronomy 32:9), "For the Lord’s portion is His people, Jacob His allotment."

May it be Your will in front of You, Lord, my God and God of my fathers, that You have Your Divine Presence rest upon us, and that You spread out Your sukkah of peace upon us, in the merit of the commandment of sukkah that we are fulfilling in order to unify the name of the Holy One, blessed be He and His Divine Presence - with fear and love - to unify the name, <i>Yod Hay</i>, with <i>Vav Hay</i> on behalf of all of Israel; and to surround them with the radiance of Your holy and pure glory, spread over their heads above 'like an eagle protecting his nest.' And from there, may the flow of life flow to Your servant, [one's name], the child of [one's mother's name], Your maidservant. And in the merit of my going out of my house - 'I eagerly pursue Your commandments' - let this be considered as if 'I wandered far away' (thus suffering the atonement of exile), and 'wash me thoroughly of my iniquity and purify me of my sin.' And 'let Your ears pay heed' to many blessings of the lofty guests, the guests of faith; and give the hungry, even the thirsty, their bread and their dependable water. And give me the merit to sit and be sheltered 'in the hidden shade of Your wings,' at the time of my leaving the world, and to be 'sheltered from the torrential rain,' when 'You rain down blazing coals upon the wicked.' And let this commandment of sukkah that I am fulfilling be considered as if I had fulfilled it with all of its details, its exact specifications, its conditions and all the commandments that depend upon it. And make the sealing [of judgement] good for us, and give us the merit to dwell many days upon the ground, the holy ground, in Your service and in Your awe. 'Blessed is the Lord forever, Amen and Amen!'

<i>On the first night when one enters the sukkah before sitting to eat, and on every night before the meal, one should say:</i>
I am inviting the lofty guests, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David.

<i>On the first day, one says:</i>
If you please, Abraham, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the second day, one says:</i>
If you please, Isaac, my lofty guest, let all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David - sit with me and with you.
<i>On the third day, one says:</i>
If you please, Jacob, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the fourth day, one says:</i>
If you please, Moses, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Aaron, Joseph and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the fifth day, one says:</i>
If you please, Aaron, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joseph and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the sixth day, one says:</i>
If you please, Joseph, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the seventh day, one says:</i>
If you please, David, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Joseph - sit with me and you. 

Leaving the Sukkah

May it be Your will in front of You, Lord, our God and God of our fathers - in the same way that I have fulfilled [the commandment] and dwelt in this sukkah, so may I merit next year to dwell in the sukkah (made from the skin) of the Leviathan.

Blessing on Lulav

Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us about holding the lulav.
<i>The first time during Sukkot that one makes a blessing on the lulav, one should also bless the following blessing:</i>
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has granted us life and sustenance and permitted us to reach this season.

Hosha'anot

For Shabbat Chol Hamoed

For Your sake, our God, please save; for Your sake, our Creator, please save!
For Your sake, our Redeemer, please save; for Your sake, our Seeker, please save!

The nation, guarded like the pupil of the eye,
contemplates the doctrine that restores the soul,
studies the laws of Shabbat,
interprets the carrying of Shabbat,
which establishes two thousand (ells) as the perimeter of Shabbat.
And [beyond this], it prevents its feet on account of the Shabbat.
It fulfills, "remember," and "guard," on the Shabbat.
It hurries to make haste [for] the coming of the Shabbat.
It busies itself [with] all from the six [days] for the Shabbat,
sits and waits until the end of Shabbat.
It calls Shabbat glory and delight;
it changes clothing and covering on the Shabbat;
food and drink does it prepare for the Shabbat,
enjoying pleasant foods for the Shabbat.
Three meals does it fulfill on Shabbat,
upon two loaves does it break [bread] on Shabbat.
It designates four domains on Shabbat.
It kindles [lights for] the commandment of lighting the candle on Shabbat.
It sanctifies the holiness (kiddush) of the day on  Shabbat,
prays the song of seven (paragraphs) on Shabbat.
It reads seven from the doctrine on Shabbat,
let it inherit the day that is completely Shabbat.
Please save!

<i>Ani Vaho</i>, please bring salvation! Like You saved Adam, the work of Your hands, as a Protector, on the holy Shabbat you found him atonement and clemency; like You saved the distinguished nation hoping for freedom, they intuited to choose the seventh [day] for repose; like You saved the people that You drove like sheep to refreshment, and You placed a law at Marah upon the waters of rest; like You saved Your privileged ones in the Wilderness of Sin in the camp, they were wise and collected double the bread on the sixth [day]; like You saved Your followers [who] instructed preparation from their intelligence, their Shepherd blessed their strength and conceded to them; like You saved those sustained in delight from that which was stored, it did not change its appearance and its aroma did not cease; like You saved those who studied the laws of carrying on Shabbat, they rested and ceased, keeping [the laws of] the domains and the perimeters; like You saved those who heard the fourth commandment [at] Sinai, the matter of "remember," and "guard," to sanctify the seventh [day]; like You saved the ones ordered in Jericho to encircle seven [times], they besieged it until it came down on Shabbat to be victorious; like You saved Kohelet and his people in the House of Eternity, they pleased You with their feasting seven and seven days; like You saved those who returned to arise from the exile to redemption, as they read Your Torah on the festival every day; like You saved those who made You rejoice in the new second [Temple], raising the lulav all seven [days] in the Temple; like You saved those that pushed off the pounding of the willow [on] Shabbat, they placed the willow branches of Motza at the base of the altar; like You saved those that rejoiced with soft, long and tall [willow branches], in their departure, they would praise, "Beauty is yours"; like You saved those who thank and hope but never alter, we all repeat, "We are His and our eyes are towards Him"; like You saved those that encircled the winepress of Your hewing with freshness, they hymn, "<i>Ani Vaho</i>, please bring salvation"; like You saved the army of careful ones who serve composed, the double sacrifice of Shabbat, [by sacrificing] the burnt-offering and the gift-offering; like You saved Your Levites singing upon their stand, saying, "A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat"; like You saved those comforted by Your commandments [which] always give them enjoyment, and You will placate and rescue them, and they shall be saved with ease and rest; like You saved the return of the tribes of Jacob - return and bring back the return of the tents of Jacob and, so too, please save! Like You saved the keepers of the commandments and those awaiting salvations - God of salvations - so too please bring salvation!

Deliver and bless Your people; tend them and sustain them forever (Psalms 28:9). And may these words of mine, which I have offered in supplication before the Lord, be close to the Lord our God day and night, that He may provide for His servant and for His people Israel, according to each day’s needs. In order that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord alone is God, there is no other (I Kings 8:59-60).

I shall set up my prayer in the house of my prayer: I have revealed my rebellion on the fast (Yom Kippur); I sought You then to save me. Listen to the voice of my prayer, and arise and bring me salvation. My Savior, remember and have mercy. Living One, indeed make me rejoice; Goodly One, in groaning, answer me - may my Savior be quick. Destroy the one who does evil to me (Satan), so that he not continue to make me evil. Quickly, God of my salvation, eternally to save me. Please lift up the iniquity of my evil, pass over my rebellion; please turn to me to bring me salvation. Rock, my righteous Savior, please accept my prayer. Lift up the horn of my salvation; Omnipresent, my Savior, please save! Appear and bring me salvation, please save!

<i>When it falls out on Tuesday:</i>

Foundation stone, chosen house, threshing floor of Ornan, hidden sanctuary, Mount Moriah, Mount of He is Seen, palace of Your splendor, residence of David, goodly ridge, beautifully placed, joy of all the earth, most beautiful bride, resting place of justice, place of Your dwelling, tranquil habitation, complete sukkah, pilgrimage of the tribes, precious corner, excellent Zion, holy of holies, inlaid with love, dwelling place of Your glory - please save! Hill of magnificence, please save!

<i>When it falls out on Thursday:</i>

The nation - 'I am a wall,' bright as the sun, exiled and turned away, compared to a date palm, the one killed for You and considered like sheep for slaughter; scattered among its angerers, hugging and clinging to You, seeking Your yoke, alone to unify You, trampled in the exile, studying Your awe, pulled of cheek, given to be paupers, bearing Your burden, ship in a storm, redeemed of Tuviah (Moses), holy sheep, congregations of Jacob, marked with Your name - roars, "Please save!" [They are] dependent upon You, please save!

<i>When it falls out on Friday:</i>

'God of salvations': 
With four oaths, 
they approach with prayers, 
knock with the arrangement of prayers, 
meditate upon the enjoyments (the Torah) 
and enjoy their riddles; 
they yell out for salvations, 
those that await salvations
with You in their prayers, 
knowing the understanding of the hours,
bending down in their prayers
to understand the traditions
that were heard from Your mouth
 - Giver of salvations - 
recounters of heard things, 
the ones that give over [the] testimony 
- Doer of salvations, 
Righteous One of salvation - 
the town (<i> a different version:</i> in the midst:) of salvation, 
[with] emotional cheers
[in] three hours, please save! 
Be quick for salvations, please save!

<i>After saying the Hoshanah of that particular day, we conclude with:</i>

Ani Vaho, please bring salvation!
Like You saved the great ones in Lud (the son of Mitzrayim, Egypt's namesake) with You, when You went out to save Your people, so too please save!
Like You saved 'a nation and its leaders' needing the salvation of God, so too please save!
Like You saved many legions and, with them, hosts of angels, so too please save!
Like You saved the pure ones from a house of bondage, [when] they subjugated the Compassionate One with their hands, so too please save!
Like You saved the drowning ones in the depths of the shreds, [when] they were transporting Your glory with them, so too please save!
Like You saved the base, singing (Exodus 13:40), "and He saved," [when] the One bursting out was indicated as saved, so too please save!
Like You saved [with] the statement (Exodus 6:6), "and I will take you (etchem)," [but] it is designated, 'and I will go out with you (itchem),' so too please save!
Like You saved the ones that went around the altar, loaded with the willow to circle the altar, so too please save!
Like You saved the wonders of the ark when it was sullied, He distraught Philistia with burning anger and it was saved, so too please save!
Like You saved the congregations You sent to Babylonia, Merciful One, You [too] were sent for their sake, so too please save!
You saved the return of the tribes of Jacob - return and bring back the return of the tents of Jacob and, so too, please bring salvation!
Like You saved the keepers of the commandments and those awaiting salvations - You are the God for the saved - so, so too please bring salvation!

Ani Vaho, please bring salvation!

Deliver and bless Your people; tend them and sustain them forever (Psalms 28:9). And may these words of mine, which I have offered in supplication before the Lord, be close to the Lord our God day and night, that He may provide for His servant and for His people Israel, according to each day’s needs. In order that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord alone is God, there is no other (I Kings 8:59-60).

<i>On Hoshana Rabba:</i> Yours is an arm endowed with might; Your hand is strong; Your right arm, exalted (Psalms 89:14).

The nation - 'I am a wall,' bright as the sun, exiled and turned away, compared to a date palm, the one killed for You and considered like sheep for slaughter; scattered among its angerers, hugging and clinging to You, seeking Your yoke, alone to unify You, trampled in the exile, studying Your awe, pulled of cheek, given to be paupers, bearing Your burden, ship in a storm, redeemed of Tuviah (Moses), holy sheep, congregations of Jacob, marked with Your name - roar, "Please save!"

for the sake of the one who was for You like an assistant among the angels of fire, 
for the sake of the gift of the statements that were given in fire, 
for the sake of that which was covered by curtains and a cloud of fire, 
for the sake of the ceremony of the mountain upon which You came down in fire, 
for the sake of the friendship of the House that You loved beyond the Heavens of fire, 
for the sake of the one who yearned until the setting of the fire,
for the sake of the one who took a pan of fire and removed the anger of fire, 
for the sake of the one zealous with a great zealotry of fire, 
for the sake of the one who waved his hand and came down stones of fire, 
for the sake of the one who made the nursing lamb be consumed with fire, 
for the sake of the one who stood in the threshing floor and was answered with fire, 
for the sake of the one who prayed in the courtyard and down came the fire, 
for the sake of the messenger that arose and was carried up by a chariot and horses of fire, 
for the sake of the holy ones that were flung into the fire, 
for the sake of the one who saw myriads and myriads and rivers of fire, 
for the sake of the desolation of Your city that was burnt down with fire, 

for the sake of of the offspring of the clans of Judah who You will make like a brazier of fire!

<b>Yours,</b> Lord, are greatness, might, splendor, triumph, and majesty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours] ; to You, Lord, belong kingship and preeminence above all (I Chronicles 29:11). And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; on that day the Lord shall be One, and his name One (Zechariah 14:9). And it is written in Your Torah, saying (Deuteronomy 6:4), "Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One" - blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom forever and ever.

Chanukah

Service for Lighting Chanukah Candles

Blessings on Chanukah Candles

Before lighting, we bless:
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe
who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the Chanukah candles.
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe
who made miracles for our ancestors in their days in this season.

On the first night:
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe
who has kept us alive, sustained us, and brought us to this season. 

Hanerot Hallalu

We kindle these lights on account of the miracles, the deliverances and the wonders which thou didst work for our fathers, by means of thy holy priests. During all the eight days of Chanukah these lights are sacred, neither is it permitted us to make any profane use of them; but we are only to look at them, in order that we may give thanks unto thy name for thy miracles, thy deliverances and thy wonders.

Maoz Tzur

O Fortress, Rock of my salvation, unto thee it is becoming to give praise:
let my house of prayer be restored, and I will there offer thee thanksgivings
when thou shalt have prepared a slaughter of the blaspheming foe,
I will complete with song and psalm the dedication of the altar.

Full sated was my soul with ills, my strength was spent with sorrow;
they embittered my life by hardship during my subjection to the dominion of Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The kingdom of the heifer," see Jeremiah 46:20.</i>
but God with his great power brought forth the chosen race,
while the host of Pharaoh and all his seed sank like a stone into the deep.

To his holy oracle he brought me, yet there also I found no peace,
for the oppressor came and led me captive, because I had served strange gods:
I had to quaff the wine of bewilderment; well nigh had I perished,
when Babylon's end drew near; through Zerubbabel I was saved after seventy years.

The Agagite (Haman), the son of Hammedatha, sought to cut down the lofty fir tree (Mordecai)<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Babli, Tr. Megillah, 10b.</i>;
but his design became a snare to himself, and his pride was brought to an end.
The head of the Benjamite thou didst exalt, but the enemy's name thou Midst blot out:
the many sons he had gotten thou didst hang upon the gallows.

The Grecians were gathered against me in the days of the Hasmoneans;
they broke down the walls of my towers, and defiled all the oils;
but from one of the last remaining flasks a miracle was wrought for thy beloved<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Likened to a lily in Song of Solomon 2:2.</i>,
and their men of understanding appointed these eight days for song and praises.

Bare Your holy arm and hasten the End of salvation –
Avenge the vengeance of Your servants’ blood from the wicked nation.
For the time has delayed and there is no end to the days of evil,
Push away the Red One in the lowest shadow and establish for us the seven shepherds.

Selichot

Fast of Gedalia



Ten of Tevet

1. Forgive us, our Parent, because we made our mistakes through the multitude of our confusions. Forgive us, our Ruler, because our evil deeds are too many. 
2. You are a patient God, and you are called Master of Mercy. You taught us the path of repentance. Remember how great your mercy and your kindness are, today and every day, for the offspring of your dear one. Turn to us mercifully, because you are Master of Mercy. We will approach your presence with pleas and prayer, as you instructed the Humble One (Moses) in ancient times. Turn back from your hot anger, as it is written in your Torah. We will shelter and rest in the shadow of your wings, as on the day of, "and God descended in a cloud." Pass over iniquity, erase guilt, as on the day of, "and he stood with Him there." Listen to our cries, and hear what we say, as on the day of, "and he called out in the name of God," when it says: 
3. "And God passed before him and called out:
4. "God, God, Divine, Merciful, Generous, Patient, Abundantly kind and true, Preserver of kindness for thousands, Tolerator of evil deeds, wickedness, sin, and Cleanser." Forgive our evil deeds and our sins, and take us as your own. Forgive us, our Parent, because we have sinned. Forgive us our Ruler, because we have violated. Because you are Adonai- good, forgiving, and abundantly kind to all who call You. 
5. Because kindness is with God, and rescue is plentiful with Him. God, rescue Israel from all its distress. He will rescue Israel from all its evil deeds. God saves the lives of His servants, and those who take shelter in Him will not be found guilty. 
6. Like a parent has mercy on children- that is how You should have mercy on us, God. Salvation is God's, Your blessing is forever on Your nation. God of Multitudes is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge forever. God of Multitudes, how lucky is a human who trusts in You. God, save! The Ruler will answer us on the day we call. 
7. The leader says-
8. Please forgive the evil deeds of this nation, matching the magnitude of Your kindness, and the way You have carried this nation from Egypt to here. There it is said, 
9. The congregation says- 
10. "God said, "I have forgiven, on your terms."
11. Tilt your ear, my God, and hear; open your eyes and see our ruins, and the city called by Your name. We throw our pleas before You not because of our righteousness, but because of Your abundant mercy. God, hear. God, forgive. God, listen and act. Do not delay, for Your own sake, because Your name is called over Your city and Your nation.
12. Selicha organized alphabetically, with the author's name "Yosef" at the end
13. Our God, and God of our ancestors:
14. I will describe the distress that calls me. He hit me with three blows this month. He cut me down, prevented me, hit me. Even now, He wears me out. He depressed me on the Eighth, right and left. Did I not establish fasts on all three of the days? And the Greek king forced me to write my religion in Greek. "Those who plow use my back to plow, they make the furrow long." I fumed on the Ninth with deep-dug shame. He removed from me the cloak of glory and alacrity. The one who had said beautiful words was torn apart on that day. This was Ezra the Scribe. (Ezekiel) Ben Buzi the Visionary was commanded about the Tenth day. He wrote for You in his book of visions. For a remembrance for a nation who is melted and disgraced. "This very day." The count of the monthly calendar was awakened against me. I stretch out my mouth with dirges and wailing. The order of the tragedies will burn in my heart. When "the refugee came to me saying the city had been hit." About these, I throw dirt on my face. I have been wounded by these four things- if only I had shot an arrow into my heart! In distress over these, I dig myself a grave. "God is justified, because I transgressed his word." I called Your name, the One comforted about my evil doings. See my suffering, hear the voice of my supplication. Listen to my pleas, quicken my salvation. "Do not shut your ear to my cry for ease, to my appeal." In the month of Tevet I was very hard-hit. The order of its celestial paths were changed against me. I rebelled, I violated, but let Him reveal His goodness to me. The One who tells the sea, "You may come up until here." 
15. God, Ruler, who sits on a throne of mercy, who behaves piously, who forgives the sins of his nation, passing the first one first, who has abundant forgiveness to sinners, who acts justly with everything flesh and spirit, You will not repay them in accordance with their evil. God, you taught us to say the Thirteen, so remember for us today the covenant of the Thirteen, as you informed the Humble One (Moses) in ancient times as it is written, "and God descended in a cloud and he stood with Him there, and he called out in the name of God," 
16. "And God passed before him and called out:
17. "God, God, Divine, Merciful, Generous, Patient, Abundantly kind and true, Preserver of kindness for thousands, Tolerator of evil deeds, wickedness, sin, and Cleanser." Forgive our evil deeds and our sins, and take us as your own. Forgive us, our Parent, because we have sinned. Forgive us our Ruler, because we have violated. Because you are Adonai- good, forgiving, and abundantly kind to all who call You. 
18. God, nations have come into your possession, contaminated your holy Palace, and given over Jerusalem to those in poverty. God, wicked ones have risen up against us, and a congregation of strident ones seek to kill us, and nothing is available to oppose them. 
19. Like a parent has mercy on children- that is how You should have mercy on us, God. Salvation is God's, Your blessing is forever on Your nation. God of Multitudes is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge forever. God of Multitudes, how lucky is a human who trusts in You. God, save! The Ruler will answer us on the day we call. 
20. Selicha organized alphabetically, with the name of the author Abraham Bar Menachem Chazak
21. Our God, and God of our ancestors: 
22. The upper stone has turned into heaps to be plowed, and those who possess the inheritance have turned into the chief wanderers among the nations. Inside me, my heart hurts, injured and depressed, as we are left with no parent, become like orphans. Soft and dainty, surrounded by roses, but now she moans, given over to the opponent. She was like a widow, the faithful city, with innumerable children, who have been sold for no money. Dainty and soft, rising to royalty, whose suffering has extended for many years and days. The House of Jacob is plundered, boldly mocked, the joyful city belongs to those planting vineyards. Her thirst was satisfied with poison, in the hand of the evil people, the one as desirable as an olah-offering and as the spiced incense. She rejected and abandoned the Torah of my abandoning parent, and could not find rest during night or day. Mighty, Ultimate God, issue a proclamation commanding a return for Zion's fight, a year of repayment. "Restore our days like in antiquity," answer, ancient God, and whiten the red like fleece, stains like snow. Strengthen us with fear of You, and with observance of your Torah, and remember us with your salvation, God, full of mercy. 
23. God, Ruler, who sits on a throne of mercy, who behaves piously, who forgives the sins of his nation, passing the first one first, who has abundant forgiveness to sinners, who acts justly with everything flesh and spirit, You will not repay them in accordance with their evil. God, you taught us to say the Thirteen, so remember for us today the covenant of the Thirteen, as you informed the Humble One (Moses) in ancient times as it is written, "and God descended in a cloud and he stood with Him there, and he called out in the name of God," 
16. "And God passed before him and called out:
17. "God, God, Divine, Merciful, Generous, Patient, Abundantly kind and true, Preserver of kindness for thousands, Tolerator of evil deeds, wickedness, sin, and Cleanser." Forgive our evil deeds and our sins, and take us as your own. Forgive us, our Parent, because we have sinned. Forgive us our Ruler, because we have violated. Because you are Adonai- good, forgiving, and abundantly kind to all who call You. 
26. Pizmon organized with the author's name at the beginning of each stanza, Abraham Isaac Ephraim Chazak
27. When my ancestors trusted in the name of my Divine refuge, they grew and succeeded and produced fruit. But from the time that they were pushed out and acted nonchalant with Him, they were "lessening continuously until the tenth month." On the Tenth of the month, the Babylonian king neared, and laid siege to the holy city, and the Captain came close, I was given to be crushed and was tortured in shackles, and every month my music turned to mourning. 
28. The earliest firstborn was the first to be destroyed. She mentioned the name of others, and that sin caused this. She did not recognize My presence, and she was swept up in the stream. She labored like she was birthing her firstborn "at the time she lifted off to great heights."
29. God brought a day of evil and constriction. He commanded my enemies around me to pick off my infants. That day my heart softened and I had no strength to stop it, and He spoke to the prophet, "Tell a parable to the House of Rebellion."
30. He removed the mantle from those sitting at the gates. He burned his anger like fire and he lifted the crown, and threw the glory off of the Forest of Lebanon, and a stormy wind runs down the hairs of my flesh like nails. 
31. You were called the most beautiful, and now you are burnt. You stumbled in sin and your heart went backward. They tailed you and made you stumble, the first and second times, and you were never bandaged with a "little balm."
32. The faultless Refuge is justified, bearing the sin of the worn-out one. He flew from the cherub to the threshold, to the corner of the roof, because of the stain of sin, and their screams arrived. Their evil was as abundant as a tree producing fruit. 
33. The One who plans narratives strengthened all my opponents, because my days of doing evil were completed. I forgot about the repayment for my embarrassing youth, "who gives me my bread, my water, my linen and my wool." 
My opponents stretched open their mouths and swallowed my possession. They were much more powerful than me, and they drank and distorted my blood. Strangers oppressed me and did evil to my brothers, "the ones who say Destroy, Destroy," the children of Seir the Horite. 
They said, "Let's go destroy them and end their memory." Jealous, vengeful God, repay them, make them carry their destruction. Pay them in accordance with their deeds, make them too ashamed to hope, like a man dreaming a dream about three baskets of bread. 
My wound was not dressed, my murderous injury. My eye is darkened, scouting for my brightly colored Beloved. Has he not forgotten his anger forever? "Why has He acted this way, what is this anger?"
37. The Merciful One, my God, do not abandon forever. My days of mourning have lasted a long time, and my heart is still sighing. God, return to my tent, do not give up your place. Pay back the days of my mourning when you come to reward me. 
God, my given portion, sense my need for help. Open up my sackcloth, to dress me with joy instead. Bring my darkness to be lit up by your light, the breath of my desire, because you are my flame. 
39. Save my life from suffering and sighs, give rest to your nation, my Ruler, my Holy One. Reverse the fast of the Fifth month to be a respite, the fasts of the Fourth and Tenth to be rejoicing and happiness.

Birkat HaMazon

<i>Psalm 137 is recited before </i>Birkas Hamazon<i> on weekdays in memory of the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash:</i>
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and we also wept, when we remembered Zion. Upon the willows in its midst, we hung our harps. For there our captors demanded of us words of song, and our tormentors asked of us [with] mirth; Sing to us from the song[s] of Zion. How shall we sing the song of Adonoy on alien soil? If I ever forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget [its movement]. May my tongue cleave to my palate, if I remember you not; if I set not Jerusalem above my highest joy. Remember, Adonoy, to the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem, [it was they] who said, Raze it, raze it to its very foundation. Daughter of Babylon, you are the annihilated one; fortunate is he who will repay you for all you have done to us. Fortunate is he who will take and dash your little ones against the rock.
<i>Psalm 126 is recited on Shabbos, Yom Tov and other festive occasions such as weddings, circumcisions or redemption of the first born.</i>
A Song of Ascents. When Adonoy brings about the return to Zion we will have been like dreamers.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Upon the redemption and return to Zion, the harshness of the exile will seem to the Jews like a terrible dream.—<i>Radak</i><br>The splendor of the return to Zion will be like the realization of an impossible dream.—<i>Seporno</i></i> Then will our mouths be filled with laughter,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmud (Maseches Berachos 31a) Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai rules that a Jew is forbidden to fill his mouth with laughter in this world until the time comes when all nations declare: “Adonoy has done great things for them”—as the verse states: אז ימלא שחוק פינו, <i>then</i>: only then, when God’s love for us is universally recognized, may we experience total exultation.</i> and our tongue with joyous song. Then will they say among the nations: ‘Adonoy has done great things for them.’ Adonoy had done great things for us; we will [then] rejoice. Adonoy! bring back our exiles like springs in the desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Just as springs of water can transform an arid desert into a fertile oasis, so will we be transformed, and flourish when God delivers us from exile.—<i>Rashi</i></i> Those who sow in tears will reap with joyous song.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A person who plants in desert-like soil is always fearful that his crops will not grow. If a spring of water should suddenly appear on his land, his joy will know no bounds. So great will our joy be at the ultimate redemption that will follow the oppression of exile.—<i>Radak</i></i> [Though] he walks along weeping, carrying the bag of seed, he will return with joyous song carrying his sheaves.
<i>When three or more males, aged 13 or older eat together one of them leads the group in reciting the Birkas Hamazon.</i>
<i>The leader begins by saying:</i>
<b>“Gentlemen, let us say the blessing:</b>
<i>The others respond:</i>
The Name of Adonoy will be blessed from now forever.
<i>The leader repeats:</i>
<b>“The Name of Adonoy will be blessed from now forever.”</b>
<i>The leader continues: (the words “our God” are substituted for “Him” and “He” if ten males are in the group):</i>
<b>“With your permission our masters and teachers, Let us bless (our God,) Him, for we have eaten of His bounty.”</b>
<i>The others respond accordingly:</i>
Blessed is (our God) He for we have eaten of His bounty and through His goodness we live.
<i>One who did not eat, responds:</i>
Blessed is (our God) He, and His Name constantly, forever and ever.
<i>The leader repeats:</i>
<b>“Blessed is (our God) He for we have eaten of His bounty and through His goodness we live.”</b>
<i>Some add:</i> Blessed is He and blessed is His Name.
<i><b>FIRST BERACHA</b></i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who nourishes the entire world with His goodness, with favor, with kindness, and with mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The righteous find <i>favor</i> in the eyes of God and are nourished because of their merit. Those who are not so worthy and do not find favor, are provided for through God’s beneficent <i>kindness</i>; while even the least worthy are recipients of God’s <i>mercy.</i>— <i>Maharal</i> in <i>Nesivos Olom</i></i> He provides food for all flesh,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This citation from Psalms 136:25 indicates that God’s kindness and compassion are universal, relating to all flesh, including animals.—<i>Avudraham.</i></i> for His kindness endures forever. And through His great goodness, we have never lacked and we will not lack food forever and ever, for the sake of His great Name. For He is Almighty Who nourishes<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“Nourishes” refers to food, “maintains” refers to clothing and “does good” refers to shelter. These are the basic needs of man, all of which God provides.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> and maintains all, does good to all, and prepares nourishment for all His creatures which He has created. Blessed are You, Adonoy Who nourishes all.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The first blessing of the <i>Birkas Hamazon</i> was composed by Moses in appreciation for the manna which God provided for the Jews in the desert. The second blessing, beginning with “Let us thank You,” was composed by Joshua in gratitude for the privilege of entering the Promised Land. The third blessing, beginning with “Have mercy,” was composed by David who conquered Jerusalem, and by Solomon who built the Temple. The fourth blessing “Who is good and beneficent to all” was composed by Rabban Gamliel the Elder and his court in Yavneh in gratitude to God for preserving the bodies of the victims of the Roman massacre at Betar, and for being enabled to bring them to proper burial.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 48b</i>
<i><b>SECOND BERACHA</b></i>
We thank You, Adonoy, our God, for Your parceling out as a heritage to our fathers, a land<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The land is mentioned even before the Exodus from Egypt because God demonstrated His extraordinary concern for the Jewish people at the very beginning of their history; first by the promise He gave to the Patriarchs concerning the Land of Israel and then, with the fulfillment of that promise, once He redeemed them from Egypt to enter the Land.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> which is desirable, good, and spacious; for Your bringing us out, Adonoy, our God, from the land of Egypt, and redeeming us from the house of bondage; for Your covenant which You sealed in our flesh; for Your Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Torah” refers to laws which are comprehensible to the human intellect; it is therefore <i>taught.</i> “Statutes” (חֻקִים) are beyond human understanding and are therefore merely <i>made known</i> to man, for man cannot comprehend them. <i>Eyun Tefilloh</i></i> which You taught us; for Your statutes which You made known to us; for the life, favor, and kindness which You granted us; and for the provision of food with which You nourish and maintain us constantly, every day, at all times and in every hour.
<i>On regular weekdays, continue, “For everything”. On Chanukah and Purim add עַל הַנִּסִּים. If you forgot to say עַל הַנִּסִּים, you may include it when you reach הָרַחֲמָן by saying: הָרַחֲמָן הוּא יַעֲשֶׂה־לָּנוּ נִסִים וְנִפְלָאוֹת כְּמוֹ שֶׁעָשָׂה לַאֲבוֹתֵינוּ בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם בַּזְּמַן הַזֶּה. and then continue on Chanukah with: בִּימֵי מַתִּתְיָהוּ, and on Purim with: בִּימֵי מָרְדְּכַי וְאֶסְתֵּר. If you reminded yourself before concluding the second blessing עַל הָאָרֶץ וְעַל הַמָּזוֹן, you may repeat it at that time and continue with the Birkas Hamazon.</i>
[We thank You] for the miracles for the redemption, for the mighty deeds, for the deliverances, for the wonders for the consolations and for the wars that You performed for our fathers in those days at this season.
<i>On Chanukah:</i>
In the days of Matisyahu, son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the statutes of Your will— You, in Your abundant mercy, stood by them in their time of distress, You defended their cause, You judged their grievances, You avenged them. You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, many into the hands of the few, defiled people into the hands of the undefiled, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent [sinners] into the hands of diligent students of Your Torah. And You made Yourself a great and sanctified name in Your world. And for Your people, Israel, You performed a great deliverance and redemption unto this very day. Afterwards, Your sons entered the Holy of Holies of Your Abode, cleaned Your Temple, purified Your Sanctuary, and kindled lights in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary, and designated these eight days of Chanukah to thank and praise Your great Name.
<i>On Purim:</i>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther in Shushan the Capital [of Persia], when the evil Haman rose up against them, he sought to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their wealth And You, in Your abundant mercy, annulled his counsel, frustrated his intention, and brought his evil plan upon his own head, and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows.
For everything Adonoy, our God, We thank You and bless You. Blessed be Your Name through the mouth of all the living, constantly, forever, as it is written: When You have eaten and are satisfied, You will bless Adonoy, your God, for the good land which He has given to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 8:10</i> Blessed are You, Adonoy, for the land and for the food.
<i><b>THIRD BERACHA</b></i>
Have compassion, Adonoy, our God, on Israel, Your people, on Jerusalem, Your city, on Zion, the dwelling place of Your glory, on the kingship of the house of David, Your anointed; and on the great and holy House upon which Your Name is called. Our God, our Father tend us, nourish us,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">“Tend us” by providing the basic necessities of life such as bread and water; “nourish” us with an enriched diet including foods such as fruits and vegetables.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> maintain us, sustain us, relieve us<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“Maintain us” with food and shelter; “sustain us” by providing our needs on a regular basis, not on a feast or famine cycle; and “relieve us” by giving us ample means to live comfortably.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> and grant us relief Adonoy, our God, speedily from all our troubles. Adonoy, our God—may we never be in need of the gifts of men nor of their loans, but only of Your hand which is full, open, holy and generous, so that we may not be shamed nor humiliated<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">May we not be “ashamed” in this world due to poverty and may we not be “humiliated” in the World-to-Come, because of our transgressions. Poverty often brings shame which in turn might cause a person to lose faith.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> forever and ever.
<i>On regular weekdays, continue, “Rebuild”. On Shabbos add:</i>
May it please You, to strengthen us Adonoy, our God, through Your commandments, and through the commandment of the seventh day, this great and holy Sabbath. For this day is great and holy before You, to refrain from work on it and to rest on it with love, as ordained by Your will. And by Your will, grant us repose Adonoy, our God, that there be no distress, sorrow, or sighing on the day of our rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Even though prayers for personal needs are not recited on Shabbos, this particular prayer does contain such a request, because it is so closely interwoven with the commandment to rest on Shabbos. Since we are commanded to make Shabbos a day of sacred rest, we ask that our repose not be desecrated by distress or misfortune.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> Show us Adonoy, our God, the consolation of Zion, Your city, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary, for You are the Master of deliverance and the Master of consolation.
<i>On Rosh Chodesh and Yom Tov add:</i>
Our God and God of our fathers, may there ascend, come, and reach, appear, be desired, and heard, counted and recalled our remembrance and reckoning; the remembrance of our fathers; the remembrance of the Messiah the son of David, Your servant; the remembrance of Jerusalem, city of Your Sanctuary; and the remembrance of Your entire people, the House of Israel, before You for survival, for well-being, for favor, kindliness, compassion, for life and peace on this day of:
<i>Rosh Chodesh</i>
the <i>Festival of Matzos</i>

the <i>Festival of Sukkos</i>
the <i>Festival of Shmini Atseres</i>
<i>Remembrance</i>

Remember us Adonoy, our God, on this day for well-being; be mindful of us on this day for blessing, and deliver us for life. In accord with the promise of deliverance and compassion, spare us and favor us, have compassion on us and deliver us; for to You our eyes are directed because You are the Almighty Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
<i>If you forgot to say רְצֵה or יַעֲלֶה וְיָבֹא and became aware of it </i>before<i> starting the fourth blessing (הַטּוֹב וְהַמֵּטִיב), or even if you are in doubt, see below for the appropriate blessing. If you reminded yourself <i>after<i> you had already begun the fourth blessing and have said: בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה', then you must repeat the entire Birkas Hamazon. These laws apply only to Shabbos, and the Festival days of Pesach, Shavuos and Sukkos. On Chol Ha-Moed or on Rosh Chodesh days that do not fall on Shabbos, you need not repeat the Birkas Hamazon even though you began the blessing of הַטּוֹב וְהַמֵּטִיב.</i></i></i>
Rebuild Jerusalem, city of the Holy Sanctuary, speedily, in our days. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Builder of Jerusalem in His mercy. Amein.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It is unusual for one to answer Amein after his own blessing. This blessing ends with Amein because it marks the end of the three blessings, authority for which is derived from Deuteronomy (8:10) and separates them from the next blessing which is Rabbinic in origin.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 45b</i>
<i><b>FOURTH BERACHA</b></i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, the Almighty, our Father, our King, our Mighty One, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Maker, our Holy One, Holy One of Jacob, our Shepherd, Shepherd of Israel, the King, Who is good and beneficent to all. Every single day He has done good, does good, and will do good to us. He has rewarded us, He rewards us, He will reward us forever with favor, kindness, and compassion, relief, rescue, and success, blessing, deliverance, and consolation, maintenance, sustenance, compassion, life, peace, and everything good; and of all good things may He never deprive us.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Many people are granted the bounties of life but are unable to enjoy them. We first invoke God’s blessing for all the good things in life and then ask Him to grant us the privilege of enjoying them.—<i>Iyun Tefilloh.</i></i>
The Merciful One will reign over us forever and ever.
The Merciful One will be blessed in heaven and on earth.
The Merciful One will be praised for all generations, He will be glorified through us forever and for all eternity; and He will be honored through us for time everlasting.
May the Merciful One maintain us with honor.
The Merciful One will break the yoke (of oppression) from our necks and lead us upright to our land.
May the Merciful One send us abundant blessing to this house, and upon this table at which we have eaten.
The Merciful One will send us Elijah the prophet, who is remembered for good, who will announce to us good tidings, deliverances, and consolations.
<i>When eating at your parents’ table, say:</i>
May the Merciful One bless my father, my teacher, the master of this house, and my mother, my teacher, the mistress of this house; them, their household, their children and all that is theirs.
<i>When eating at your own table, say:</i>
May the Merciful One bless me, my spouse, my children, and all that is mine;
Ours and all that is ours— just as our forefathers were blessed— Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob— In all things,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was blessed “in all things.” Genesis 24:1</i> “From everything,”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac said: “I have partaken from everything.” Genesis 27:33</i> and “With everything”;<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob said: “I have everything.” Genesis 33:11</i> so may He bless us, all of us together, with a perfect blessing and let us say Amein.

And he will be successful with all his possessions. May his properties prosper and be located close to town. May no evil force have power over his endeavors. May no opportunity present itself before him any matter of sin, nor thought of iniquity from now forever.
From on high, may there be invoked upon them and upon us, [the] merit to insure peace, And may we receive a blessing from Adonoy, and kindness from the God of our deliverance; and may we find favor and understanding in the eyes of God and man.
<i>On Shabbos say:</i>
May the Merciful One let us inherit the day which will be completely Shabbos and rest, for life everlasting.
<i>On Rosh Chodesh say:</i>
May the Merciful One renew for us this month for good and for blessing.
<i>On Yom Tov say:</i>
May the Merciful One let us inherit that day which is completely good.

May the Merciful One renew for us this year for good and for blessing.

May the Merciful One raise up for us the fallen Tabernacle of David.

<i>If you forgot to say יַעֲלֶה וְיָבֹא on Rosh Hashanah:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who gave Festivals to His people Israel for remembrance.
<i>If Rosh Hashanah occurs on Shabbos and you forgot to say רְצֵה and יַעֲלֶה וְיָבֹא:</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Who gave Shabbosos for rest to His people Israel, with love for a sign and a covenant, and Yomim Tovim to Israel, for remembrance. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Sanctifier of Shabbos, Israel, and the Day of Remembrance.
