Blessings on Chanukah Candles



Hanerot Hallalu

We kindle these lights on account of the miracles, the deliverances and the wonders which thou didst work for our fathers, by means of thy holy priests. During all the eight days of Chanukah these lights are sacred, neither is it permitted us to make any profane use of them; but we are only to look at them, in order that we may give thanks unto thy name for thy miracles, thy deliverances and thy wonders.

Maoz Tzur

O Fortress, Rock of my salvation, unto thee it is becoming to give praise:
let my house of prayer be restored, and I will there offer thee thanksgivings
when thou shalt have prepared a slaughter of the blaspheming foe,
I will complete with song and psalm the dedication of the altar.

Full sated was my soul with ills, my strength was spent with sorrow;
they embittered my life by hardship during my subjection to the dominion of Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The kingdom of the heifer," see Jeremiah 46:20.</i>
but God with his great power brought forth the chosen race,
while the host of Pharaoh and all his seed sank like a stone into the deep.

To his holy oracle he brought me, yet there also I found no peace,
for the oppressor came and led me captive, because I had served strange gods:
I had to quaff the wine of bewilderment; well nigh had I perished,
when Babylon's end drew near; through Zerubbabel I was saved after seventy years.

The Agagite (Haman), the son of Hammedatha, sought to cut down the lofty fir tree (Mordecai)<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Babli, Tr. Megillah, 10b.</i>;
but his design became a snare to himself, and his pride was brought to an end.
The head of the Benjamite thou didst exalt, but the enemy's name thou Midst blot out:
the many sons he had gotten thou didst hang upon the gallows.

The Grecians were gathered against me in the days of the Hasmoneans;
they broke down the walls of my towers, and defiled all the oils;
but from one of the last remaining flasks a miracle was wrought for thy beloved<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Likened to a lily in Song of Solomon 2:2.</i>,
and their men of understanding appointed these eight days for song and praises.
