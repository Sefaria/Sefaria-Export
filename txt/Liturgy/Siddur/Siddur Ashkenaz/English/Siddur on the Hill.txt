Psalm 95


Come, let us sing to YHVH, and shout for joy to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us come into YHVH’s presence with thanks; let us shout for joy to YHVH with song. For YHVH is a great god, and a great majesty above all gods. In God’s hands are the depths of the earth, and the peaks of the mountains are God’s. The sea is God’s, for God made it; and God’s hands shaped the dry land. Come, let us bow down and bend the knee; let us kneel before YHVH our maker, For YHVH is our god, and we are the people that God shepherds, the flock of God’s hand. Today, if you would but listen to God’s voice! Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as on the day of Massah, in the wilderness; When your ancestors tested and tried Me, even though they saw My work. For forty years, I was weary with that generation and said: This is a people confused at heart, that do not know My ways. For that reason, I swore in My anger, that they would never enter My resting place. 

Psalm 96

 Sing to YHVH a new song; sing to YHVH, all the earth. Sing to YHVH, bless God’s name; proclaim God’s deliverance day after day. Tell of God’s glory among the nations, God’s wonderful acts among all peoples. For YHVH is great and highly praised; awesome is God, above all gods. For all the gods of the peoples are only idols, but YHVH made the heavens. Honor and majesty in God’s presence; strength and beauty in God’s sanctuary. Grant to YHVH, O families of peoples, grant to YHVH glory and strength. Grant to YHVH the glory due God’s name; bring an offering, and come into God’s courts. Bow down to YHVH in the beauty of holiness; tremble in God’s presence, all the earth. Say among the nations: “YHVH reigns.” The earth holds firm and cannot be shaken; God judges the peoples with fairness. Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all within it and all within it. Let the field exult, and all inside it. Then all the trees of the wood will shout for joy before YHVH, who is coming. For God is coming to judge the earth; God will judge the earth with righteousness and the peoples with God’s faithfulness.
