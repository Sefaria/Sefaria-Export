I offer thanks to You, living and eternal King, for You have mercifully restored my soul within me; Your faithfulness is great

Netilat Yadayim



Asher Yatzar

Praised are You, Lord our God King of the universe, who with wisdom fashioned the human body, creating openings and organs. It is known before your exalted Throne that should but one of them, by being blocked or opened, fail to function, it would be impossible to exist. Praised are you, Lord, healer of all flesh who performs wonders.

Torah Blessings

Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us to be involved with words of Torah.
And please, Lord, our God, make the words of Your Torah pleasant in our mouths and in the mouths of all of Your people, the House of Israel. And may we and our offspring [and the offspring of our offspring] and the offspring of Your people, the House of Israel - all of us - be knowing of Your Name and studying Your Torah for its sake. Blessed are You, Lord, Who teaches Torah to His people, Israel.
Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who has chosen us from all of the nations and given us His Torah. Blessed are You, Lord, Who gives the Torah.

Torah Study



These are the deeds that yield immediate fruit in This World and continue to yield fruit in the World to Come: honoring parents; doing deeds of lovingkindness; arriving the house of study early--morning and evening; providing hospitality; visiting the sick; helping the needy bride; attending to the dead; probing the meaning of prayer; making peace between one person and another, and between husband and wife.  And the study of Torah outweighs them all. 

Tallit


For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, with fear and love and love and fear, to unify the Name of <i>Yud Hei</i> with <i>Vav Hei</i> with a complete unity, in the name of all Israel. Behold, I am wrapping my body with <i>tsitsit</i> (fringes). So too may You wrap my soul – my 248 limbs and my 365 tendons – in the light of the <i>tsitsit</i>, [the letters, strings and knots of] which add up to 613. And in the same way that I cover myself with a prayer shawl in this world, so too may I merit to be in the section of the rabbis and to have a fine prayer shawl in the next world, in the Garden of Eden. And through the commandment of <i>tsitsit</i>, save my essence, my spirit, my soul and my prayer from [negative forces]. And may the prayer shawl spread its wings upon them to save them, ‘like an eagle that rouses his nestlings, hovering over his young.’ And may [this] commandment of <i>tsitsit</i> be considered before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if I fulfilled it in all of its details, all of its minutiae and all of its intentions – [as well as] the 613 commandments that are dependent upon it. Amen, Selah. (The tsitsit is dyed with tekhelet from the chilazon; the sea worm bonellia viridis).<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The real chilazon is made from the bonellia viridis trochophore with the following steps. 1. The trochophore has independent development, it cannot make contact with bonellin on its mother or the sand ground. 2. It is paralyzed with man o war poison. 3. It is exposed to a radioactive spring. 4. It is exposed to the alarm pheromone of its mother. Triggered by first coating the proboscis of mother with acid from slightly heated olive oil and ashes from burned wood. This is to break up the stickiness of the bonellin and mucus in proboscis. It will also break down the bonellin made so that it can no longer paralyze creatures that attack it. This will cause it to not be able to catch food and defend itself. It helps to have food pushed down into its tail in order for the fish to be aware of the food not sticking. Also, it helps for it to switch from light to darkness constantly. In order for it to be aware that the problem is not because there isn't enough  light but the bonellin is. Also, cutting its setae hairs triggers this. It will then stop making bonellin. It takes about 1 month for this to happen. The rest of the bonellin and mucus that is stored in the proboscis can be cleared by putting hot spices in it and blowing hot air inside. And then you make a cut in its mouth so that it bleeds.</i>

Tefillin

For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, with fear and love and love and fear, to unify the Name of <i>Yud Hei</i> with <i>Vav Hei</i> with a complete unity, in the name of all Israel. Behold, in placing the <i>tefillin</i> [upon myself], I intend to fulfill the commandment of my Creator, Who commanded us to place <i>tefillin</i>; as it is written in His Torah (Deuteronomy 6:8), “Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead.” And they are four sections [from the Torah]: Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-8); And it shall be if you will truly listen (Deuteronomy 11:13-21); Sanctify (Exodus 13:1-10); And it shall be when He brings you (Exodus 12:11-17) – since within them they contain His unity and oneness in the world, may His name be blessed; and [through them,] we can remember His miracles and wonders when He took us out of Egypt, and that He has the power and control over the higher beings and the lower beings to do what He wants with them. And He commanded us to place it upon the arm in memory of the ‘extended forearm’ (with which He took us out of Egypt); and that it be across from the heart in order to subjugate the desire and thoughts of our heart for His service, may His name be blessed. And upon the head across from the brain, such that the soul in my brain – along with all my other senses and powers – be subjugated to His service, may His name be blessed. And may the bounty from the commandment of <i>tefillin</i> flow upon me, such that I should have long life, holy bounty, holy thoughts – free from any conjectures of sin or transgression – such that the evil impulse not seduce us or disturb us, but leave us to serve the Lord, as it is in our hearts. And may it be Your will before You, Lord our God and God of our fathers that [this] commandment of <i>tefillin</i> be considered before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if I fulfilled it in all of its details, all of its minutiae and all of its intentions – [as well as] the 613 commandments that are dependent upon it. Amen, Selah.

Ma Tovu



Adon Olam

The king of the world, who ruled before any creature was created. At the time they were made, all was according to His will, and then His name was called "King". And after everything was finished, he alone ruled, awe-inspiring. He was, He is, and He will be with splendor. And, he was first, with no second, to rule over him or to collaborate; with no beginning and no end, he has the strength and the right. And he is my G-d, my redeemer is alive; the rock who sustains me in a distressful day. And he is my banner and refuge, the portion of my cup on the day I call out. In his hand, I safeguard my spirit, [for] when I sleep, [I know that] I will wake. And with my spirit is my body; G-d is for me, and I will not be afraid. 

Yigdal

May the living G-d be exalted, and praised, it is found that there is no specific time to find him [for he is eternal]. He is one, and there is none as unified as his unity; it is hidden, and there is also no end to his unity. He has no bodily form, and no body; his holiness has not been ordered for him. He is earlier than anything which he created, [He is] the first and there is none before His earliness. He is surely the lord of the world, to all being, and He teaches his greatness and kingship. An abundance of prophecy He gave to them, his special and splendorous people. There never again arose in Israel like Moses, a prophet and seer of His image. A truthful instruction, G-d gave to His people, by the hand of his prophet who was trustworthy in His house. The G-d will not change, nor will he switch His belief, forever [there is none] except for Him. He watches and knows our secrets, and looks at the end of something at its beginning. He recompensates people with kindness, according to their deeds, and gives the wicked bad according to his evil. At the end of days, He will send our annointed, to redeem those who wait for the end [when] His salvation [takes place]. The dead will G-d resuscitate, in his abundant kindness, blessed be His praised name forever.

And that You do not bring us not to the hands of sin, nor to the hands of transgression and wrongdoing, nor to the hands of trial, and nor to the hands of scorn. And let not the evil inclination rule inside us, and distance us from a bad person and a bad friend. And stick us to the good inclination and to good deeds, and force our inclination to be subdued to You. And grant us today and every day grace and kindness and mercy, in your eyes and in the eyes of all who see us, and reward us with good kindnesses. Blessed are You, Hashem, who rewards good kindnesses upon His nation, Israel. 
May it be pleasing before You, Hashem my G-d and the G-d of my forefathers, that save us today and every day from those who are arrogant and from arrogance itself, from a bad person, a bad friend, a bad neighbor, a bad strike, from the destructive Satan, from a harsh law and from a harsh judge, whether he is a son of the covenant or whether he is not a son of the covenant.

Akedah



Sovereignty of Heaven

A human should always be in awe of Heaven in private, and acknowledge the truth, and speak truth in one's heart as they arise early in the morning and say: Master of All Words, not upon our righteousness do supplicate ourselves in Your presence, but on Your great compassion. What are we? What are our lives? What is our lovingkindness? What is our righteousness? What is our salvation? What is our power? What is our might? What can we say in Your presence, Eternal One, our God and God of our ancestors? Are not the mighty like nothing in Your presence, and the renowned like as nonexistent, and the wise like those without knowledge, and the understanding like those without sense? Most of what they do is void and the days of their lives are vanity in Your presence. And the difference between human and beast is nil, because everything is vanity. But we are Your people, the children of Your covenant. The children of Abraham, whom You love, that You made and oath with on Mount Moriah. The seed of Isaac, Your beloved, who was bound on the top of the altar. The congregation of Jacob, Your first-born son, the one  that You loved, and the one You rejoiced in. so that You called his name Israel and Yeshurun.......
Therefore, we are obligated to acknowledge You and to praise You, and to glorify You, and to bless and to sanctify and to give praise and thanksgiving to Your name. Fortunate are we! How good is our portion, and how pleasant is our fate, and how beautiful is our inheritance. Fortunate are we the we arise early and go to bed, morning and night and say twice each day:
Hear Israel, the Eternal One is our God, the Eternal One alone.

(Psalms 145) A song of praise. Of David. I will extol You, my God and king, and bless Your name forever and ever. Every day will I bless You and praise Your name forever and ever. Great is the LORD and much acclaimed; His greatness cannot be fathomed. One generation shall laud Your works to another and declare Your mighty acts. The glorious majesty of Your splendor and Your wondrous acts will I recite. Men shall talk of the might of Your awesome deeds, and I will recount Your greatness. They shall celebrate Your abundant goodness, and sing joyously of Your beneficence. The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in kindness. The LORD is good to all, and His mercy is upon all His works. All Your works shall praise You, O LORD, and Your faithful ones shall bless You. They shall talk of the majesty of Your kingship, and speak of Your might, to make His mighty acts known among men and the majestic glory of His kingship. Your kingship is an eternal kingship; Your dominion is for all generations. The LORD supports all who stumble, and makes all who are bent stand straight. The eyes of all look to You expectantly, and You give them their food when it is due. You give it openhandedly, feeding every creature to its heart’s content. The LORD is beneficent in all His ways and faithful in all His works. The LORD is near to all who call Him, to all who call Him with sincerity. He fulfills the wishes of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and delivers them. The LORD watches over all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy. My mouth shall utter the praise of the LORD, and all creatures shall bless His holy name forever and ever.

Blessings of the Shema

First Blessing before Shema



Second Blessing before Shema

(1) [With] great love You have loved us, Lord, our God; [with] great and abundant compassion have You had compassion upon us. Our Parent, our Sovereign — for the sake of our ancestors who trusted in You, and whom You taught laws of life, so [too] be gracious to us and teach us. Our Parent, merciful Parent, Who acts with compassion, have compassion on us and put into our hearts [comprehension] to understand and to discern, to listen, to learn and to teach, to keep, to practice, and to fulfill all the words of the teachings in Your Torah with love. And enlighten our eyes with Your Torah, and attach our hearts to Your mitzvot, and unify our hearts to love and revere Your Name; and may we never be embarrassed, for in Your holy Name— [which is] great and awe-inspiring— have we trusted; may we delight and rejoice in Your deliverance. Bring us in peace [wholeness] from the four corners of the earth; and lead us upright to our land. Because, You are the Almighty, Who performs acts of deliverance, and You have chosen us from among all peoples and languages, and You have brought us close to Your great Name in truth; to thank You and unify You with love. Blessed are You, Lord, Who chooses the people Israel with love.

Shema








The real chilazon the tekhelet comes from is the sea worm bonellia viridis. See the full article at parshasheets.com and scroll down to identifying chilazon. 

Blessing after Shema



You were always the help of our ancestors, a shield for them and their children, our deliverer in every generation.  Though You abide at the pinnacle of the universe, Your just decrees extend to the ends of the earth.  Happy the one who obeys Your mitzvot, who takes to heart the words of Your Torah.  You are, in truth, a mentor to Your people, their defender and mighty Ruler.  You are first and You are last; we have no Sovereign or Redeemer but You.  You rescued us from Egypt, and redeemed us from the house of bondage.  The firstborn of the Egyptians were slain; Your firstborn were saved.  You split the waters of the sea.  The faithful You rescued; the wicked drowned.  The waters engulfed Israel's enemies; not one of the arrogant remained alive.  Then Your beloved sang hymns of acclamation, extolling you with psalms of adoration.  They acclaimed G-d Sovereign, great and awesome Source of all blessing, the everliving G-d, exalted in all majesty.  G-d humbles the proud and raises the lowly, frees the captive and redeems the meek.  G-d helps the needy and answers G-d's people's call.  Praises to G-d supreme, who is ever praised.  Moses and the people Israel joyfully sang this song to you.  "Who is like you, Adonai, among all that is worshipped!  Who is, like You, majestic in holiness, awesome in splendor, working wonders!"  The redeemed sang a new song for You.  They sang in chorus at the shore of the sea, acclaiming Your sovereignty: "Adonai shall reign throughout all time."  Rock of Israel, arise to Israel's defense.  Fulfill Your promise to deliver Judah and Israel.  Our Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Adonai Tz'va-ot.  Praised are You, Adonai, Redeemer of the people Israel.

Pity and have mercy upon us and upon all of our grain and our fruit; and bless us with rains of blessing; and may we merit life and plenty and peace, like the good years. And remove from us pestilence, sword, famine, evil animals, captivity and despoliation, the evil impulse, evil and difficult sicknesses and evil and difficult events; and decree upon us good decrees in front of You.

Thanksgiving

We gratefully thank You, for You, O Lord our God, are our fathers' God for all eternity, our Rock, our Shield of salvation generation to generation. We thank You and recount Your praise for our lives. We trust our lives into Your loving hand. Our souls are in Your custody and Your miracles are with us every day and Your wonders and goodness are with us at all times: evening, morning and noon. You are good, for Your mercies never fail us, and the Compassionate One, for Your loving kindness never ceases; forever we have placed our hope in You. 
(The rabbis thanks/<i>modim de'rabbanan</i>: We gratefully thank You, for You, O Lord our God, are our fathers' God, the God of all flesh, our Maker, the Maker of Creation. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and holy name for Your bringing us to life and preserving us. So [too], make us live and preserve us and gather our exiles to Your holy courtyards, to keep Your statutes and to do Your will and to serve You with a complete heart. About that which we thank You, blessed is the God of thanksgivings.)
(During the season of Hanukkah add: And we praise You for the miracles and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and for the victories and for the battles that You performed for our fathers in those days at this time:
In the days of Mattisyahu, the son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean, and his sons, when the wicked kingdom of Greece rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to stray from the laws of Your will, You, with great mercy stood by them in the time of their distress. You fought their fight, judged their cause and avenged them with vengence. You delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of the few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous and the arrogant into the hands of those engaged with Your Torah. For Yourself you made a great and holy name in Your world, You performed a great deliverance for Your people Israel on this day. After these things, Your children entered into the Holy of Holies of Your House, cleansed Your Temple, purified the place of Your Holiness, kindled lights in Your holy courts and established these eight days of Hanukkah to express thanksgiving and praise to Your great name.) 
(On Purim add: And we praise You for the miracles and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and for the victories and for the battles that You performed for our fathers in those days at this time: In the days of Mordecai and Esther, in Shushan the capital, when the evil Haman rose up against them, when he sought to destroy, murder, and to eliminate all the Jews, from the young to the old, infants and women, in one day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month of Adar, and plunder their wealth. In great mercy You frustrated his counsel and ruined his plan, and You returned his plan upon his own head and they hanged him and his sons upon the tree.) 
And for all these, may Your name be blessed and exalted, our King, always and forever and ever.
(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur add: Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.) 
All the living shall gratefully acknowledge You, Selah; and praise Your name in truth, the God of our salvation and our help, Selah. Blessed are You, O Lord, Whose name is good and to Whom it is fitting to give thanks.

Birkat Kohanim

Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing, found in Your Torah, written by the hand of Moses you servant, and said to Aaron and his priestly sons, Your holy people:
May the Lord bless you and keep you.<br>May the Lord shine His face upon you and treat you graciously.<br>May the Lord lift His face towards you and grant you peace.

Peace

Establish peace, goodness, blessing, grace, loving kindness and mercy upon us and upon all Israel Your people. Bless us our Father, all of us as one, with the light of Your face. For in the light of Your face You gave to us, O Lord our God, the Torah of life and love of kindness and righteousness and blessing and compassion and life and peace. It is good in Your eyes to bless Your people Israel during all times and in all hours with Your peace. 
<small><em>Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur add: </em>(In the book of life, blessing, peace and good prosperity may we be remembered and inscribed before You, ourselves and all the house of Israel, for a life of goodness and peace. Blessed are You, O Lord, Who makes peace.)  </small>
Blessed are You, O Lord, Who blesses Your people Israel with peace. 

Concluding Passage


May the words of my mouth and the rumination of my heart be acceptable in front of You, O lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceit. To those who curse me, let my life remain silent and my life be like dust to all, open my heart to Your Torah, then I will pursue Your commandments. As for those who design evil against me, quickly nullify their counsel and disrupt their design. Act for Your Name's sake; act for Your right hand's sake; act for Your sanctity's sake; act for Your Torah's sake. Then Your beloved ones may be given rest; may Your right hand save and respond to me. May the words of my mouth and the musings of my heart be acceptable before You, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer. He Who makes peace in His heights, may he make peace upon us and to all Israel.  And we say Amen. 
May it be Your will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the Holy Temple be speedily rebuilt in our days and grant us our portion in Your Torah, and may we serve You there with reverence as in the days of old and the earliest of years. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to You O Lord, as in the days of old and the earliest years.

We rise to our duty to praise the Master of all, to acclaim the Creator.  G-d made our lot unlike that of other people, assigning to us a unique destiny.  (For they worship vanity and emptiness, and pray to a god who cannot save.)  We bend the knee and bow, acknowledging the Supreme Sovereign, the Holy One, exalted, who spread out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, whose glorious abode is in the loftiest heights.  This is our G-d; there is no other.  In truth, G-d alone is our Ruler, as it is written in the Torah: "Know this day and take it to heart that Adonai is G-d in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other."
And so we hope in You, Adonai our G-d, soon to see Your splendor: that You will sweep idolatry away so that false gods will be utterly destroyed, and that You will perfect the world by Your sovereignty so that all humanity will invoke Your name, and all the earth's wicked will return to You, repentant.  Then all who live will know that to You every knee must bend, every tongue pledge loyalty.  To You, Adonai, may all bow in worship.  May they give honor to Your glory; may everyone accept Your dominion.  Reign over all, soon and for all time.  Sovereignty is Yours in glory, now and forever.  Thus it is written in Your Torah: "Adonai reigns for ever and ever."  Such is the prophetic assurance: "Adonai shall be acknowledged Ruler of all the earth.  On that day Adonai shall be One and G-d's name One."

I believe with perfect faith that the Creator His name be blessed created and controls all creations, and he alone performed, performs, and will perform all actions.

I believe with perfect faith that the Creator His name be blessed has no physical form, cannot be comprehended in physical terms, and is completely incomparable.
I believe with perfect faith that the Creator His name be blessed is first and last.
I believe with perfect faith that solely the Creator His name be blessed is fit to be prayed to, and it is unfit to pray to any other being.
I believe with perfect faith that all the words of the the prophets and true.

Hallelujah. Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him on high. Praise Him, all His angels, praise Him, all His hosts. Praise Him, sun and moon, praise Him, all bright stars. Praise Him, highest heavens, and you waters that are above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the LORD, for it was He who commanded that they be created. He made them endure forever, establishing an order that shall never change. (Psalm 148:1-6)
There are those who now set the following intention:<br>Behold I am ready and prepared to fulfill the commandment to sanctify the new moon. For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, blessed be he, and his Presence, through the One that is hidden and concealed, in the name of all Israel!<br>One should face east (or Jerusalem) with their feet together as during the Amidah prayer. They should look once at the face of the moon before beginning the blessing, and not look at it again.
Blessed are you oh Lord our God, King of the world, who created the heavens with his word and blew out with his breath all their hosts. He gave them a time and a decree, that they not change their assigned task. They are joyful and happy to do the will of their Maker, the true worker whose work is truth. He said to the moon to renew itself as a crown of splendor for those born of the womb, those who in the future will renew themselves like it, and as a glorification for their Shaper for the name of his glorious kingdom. Blessed are you, oh Lord, who renews the months.
Say the following three times: Blessed is your Shaper, Blessed is your Maker, Blessed is your Creater.
Say the following three times while dancing: Just as I dance toward you but am unable to touch you, so too may my enemies be unable to touch me for evil.
Say the following three times: Let fall upon them fear and terror! May the greatness of your arm strike them still as stone!
Say the following three times: As stone let them be still at the greatness of your arm! Fear and terror let fall upon them!
Say the following three times: David, King of Israel, is alive and enduring!
Turn to extend greetings to three people: Peace upon you,
and they should respond: Upon you, peace
Say the following three times: May there be a good sign and good fortune for us and all Israel. Amen!
Hark, the voice of my beloved! There he comes, leaping over mountains, bounding over hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or like a young stag. There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the window, peering through the lattice. (Song of Songs 2:8-9)
A song for ascents. I turn my eyes to the mountains; from where will my help come? My help comes from the LORD, maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot give way; your guardian will not slumber; See, the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps! The LORD is your guardian, the LORD is your protection at your right hand. By day the sun will not strike you, nor the moon by night. The LORD will guard you from all harm; He will guard your life. The LORD will guard your going and coming now and forever. (Psalm 121)
Hallelujah. Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the sky, His stronghold. Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him for His exceeding greatness. Praise Him with blasts of the horn; praise Him with harp and lyre. Praise Him with timbrel and dance; praise Him with lute and pipe. Praise Him with resounding cymbals; praise Him with loud-clashing cymbals. Let all that breathes praise the LORD. Hallelujah. (Psalm 150)
The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: If the Jewish people merited to greet the Face of their Father in Heaven only one time each and every month, it would suffice for them, since in the blessing of the moon there is an aspect of greeting the Divine Presence. Abaye said: Therefore, we will say the blessing while standing, in honor of the Divine Presence. (Sanhedrin 42a) Who is she that comes up from the desert, Leaning upon her beloved? (Song of Songs 8:5) May it be willed before You, oh Lord, my God and God of my fathers to fill the blemish of the moon so that it should have no longer any smallness. Let the light  of moon be like the light of the sun, like the light of the seven days of creation as it was before its diminution as it says “…the two great lights…” (Genesis 1:16) Let the verse be fulfilled for us as it is written “…and they will seek the LORD their God and David their king…” (Hoshea 3:5) Amen.
For the leader; with instrumental music. A psalm. A song. May God be gracious to us and bless us; may He show us favor, selah that Your way be known on earth, Your deliverance among all nations. Peoples will praise You, O God; all peoples will praise You. Nations will exult and shout for joy, for You rule the peoples with equity, You guide the nations of the earth. Selah. The peoples will praise You, O God; all peoples will praise You. May the earth yield its produce; may God, our God, bless us. May God bless us, and be revered to the ends of the earth. (Psalm 67)

Beloved of my soul, compassionate Father, draw me, your servant, to your desire.  Would that I could run like a gazelle, and bow before Your beauty, for I find your love sweeter than honey or any delight.
Beautiful, splendrous light of the world, my soul is sick with love.  God, please heal her by bathing her in your serene light -- then she shall surely be strengthened and healed and be Your servant forever.
Ancient One, let Your compassion flow.  Have pity on the child whom You love -- for I have yearned so long to see your luminescent power.  My God, my beloved, hurry; please, do not hide!
Please, my beloved, reveal Yourself.  Spread the sukkah of your love over me.  May the whole world be illuminated with Your glory; then shall we be glad and rejoice with You.  My lover -- come quickly, for the time has come -- have compassion for me as in days of old.

Do not be ashamed nor confounded. Why should you be downtrodden and why should you be shocked? Within you the afflicted of My people will seek refuge. And the city will be rebuilt on its former site. ...
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
And your oppressors will be destroyed. And those who would devour you will be far away. Your God will rejoice over you. Like a bridegroom rejoices over his bride. 
Come, beloved to greet the bride! Let us receive the Shabbat.
Right and left you will proliferate. And you will worship God. Through the man who descends from Peretz. And we shall celebrate and rejoice.

And God blessed the seventh day, and he sanctified it; for on it had God rested from all the work which he had created to do.

The king of the world, who ruled before any creature was created.
At the time they were made, all was according to His will, and then His name was called "King".
And after everything was finished, he alone ruled, awe-inspiring. 
He was, He is, and He will be with splendor.
And, he was first, with no second, to rule over him or to collaborate;
with no beginning and no end, he has the strength and the right.
And he is my G-d, my redeemer is alive; the rock who sustains me in a distressful day.
And he is my banner and refuge, the portion of my cup on the day I call out.
In his hand, I safeguard my spirit, [for] when I sleep, [I know that] I will wake.
And with my spirit is my body; G-d is for me, and I will not be afraid.

All who sanctify the Seventh as it deserves
All who protect the Sabbath according to its law from breakers
His reward is very great, correspondent to his act
Each according to his camp, each according to his flag.
God-lovers, who hope for the building of Ariel
On the Sabbath day they celebrate like those who received the gift of Nahaliel
Also their hands lift up the holy, and they say to God
"Blessed is the LORD who gave rest to his people Israel."
God-seekers, progeny of Abraham his beloved
Who delay leaving the Sabbath, and hurry to enter it
Who are happy to keep it, and to make its eruv,
"This is the day which the LORD made, let us celebrate on it!"
Recall the Law of Moses, which records the Sabbath commandment!
Set for the seventh day, like a bride arranged between her maids,
The pure ones inherit her, and sanctify her by retelling all which she did.
"And God completed on the seventh day the work which he did."
A holy day is it, from its coming to its departure
All progeny of Jacob will glorify it, per royal decree
to rest on it and to celebrate its pleasures, to eat and drink
"All the gathering of Israel will do this."
Disburse your kindness to those who know you, O jealous and vengeful god
Guards of the seventh day, who establish "Recall" and "Keep"
Celebrate in the building of Salem, make them shine with the radiance of your face,
"They will overflow with the abundance of your houses, and with your delicious spring you will water them."
Help those who rest on the seventh, planting and harvest, forever,
Taking a small step, eating so as to bless three times,
Their righteousness shines like the light of the seven days
"LORD god of Israel, give a sign!"
Sanctify them with you commandments, and make them as pure as the very sky
Let your spirit give them rest like a beast descending to the plain from a peak
Settle their tribes in the territory of the moon,
"Like groves they will spread, like gardens by the river."

High above all His host;
They all announce his might.
Blessed be He who has in hand

He selected Jacob’s family
To teach them the Laws
Which, if a man follow them,
He will live.

Who could justify themselves?
All are like dust.
Truly, none is worthy

There is none like You among the gods, Adonai, and nothing like Your works. Your kingship is a kingship of all worlds, and Your reign is with generation upon generation. The Eternal rules. The Eternal has ruled. The Eternal will rule forever and ever. The Eternal will give strength to the Eternal's people. The Eternal will bless the Eternal's people with peace.
Father of compassion, do well with Your will upon Zion. Build the walls of Jerusalem, for in You alone we have trusted, King, uplifted and exalted Divinity, master of infinitudes.

Vayehi Binsoa

It happened upon the journeying of the Ark, Moses said, “Rise, Eternal,” and Your enemies were dispersed, and Your foes were put to flight from before You. For the Torah will come forth from Zion, and the word of the Eternal from Jerusalem. Blessed is the one who gave Torah to [the] people of Israel in holiness.

Haftarah

(Before reading the haftarah, the reader recites this blessing:) Blessed are You, Eternal, our Divinity, King of the universe, who chose good prophets and favored their spoken words with truth. Blessed are You, Eternal, the Choosing of Torah, [the] servant Moses, [the] people Israel, and prophets of truth and justice.
(After reading the haftarah, the reader says these blessings:) Blessed are You, Eternal, our Divinity, King of the universe, Rock of all infinitudes, righteous in all generations, Faithful Divinity who says and does, speaks and fulfills all words of truth and justice.
You are faithful, Eternal, our Divinity, and Your words are faithful. And not one of your earliest words will return empty. For You are a faithful and compassionate Divinity, King. Blessed are You, Eternal, the faithful Divinity in all generations.
Have compassion upon Zion, for it is the house of our lives. And save the poor of spirit swiftly in our days.
Blessed are You, Eternal, who causes Zion to rejoice with her [children].
Gladden us, Eternal, our Divinity, with Your servant Elijah the prophet, and with the reign of the house of David, Your anointed one. May he quickly come and gladden our hearts. Upon his throne there shall not sit a stranger, nor shall others again possess his glory. For in Your holy name, You promised him that his light would not be extinguished for eternity. Blessed are You, Eternal, shield of David. (Say the blessings until this point on communal fasts and Yom Kippur mincha.)
(Say on Shabbat and Shabbat during Pesach:) For the Torah, service, prophets, and this day of Shabbat that You have given us, Eternal, our Divinity, for holiness and comfort, for honor and glory. For everything, Eternal, our Divinity, we thank You and bless You. May Your name be blessed in the mouth of all life always, forever and ever. Blessed are You, Eternal, the one who sanctifies Shabbat.
(Say on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals -- Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot -- and on the Shabbat during Sukkot:)

Prayer of the State of Israel

Our Father in Heaven,
the Rock and Redeemer of Israel,
Bless the State of Israel,
the first sprouting of our redemption.
Protect it with Your great kindness,
spread over it the shelter of Your peace,
grant Your light and truth to its leaders, ministers, and advisors,  
and provide them with Your good counsel. 
Strengthen the hands of the defenders of our Holy Land,
bequeath deliverance to them, our God,
crown them with the crown of victory,
and give peace to the land
and everlasting joy to its inhabitants.
And remember all our brethren of the House of Israel,
in all the lands of their dispersion,
and bring them quickly to Zion, Your city,
and to Jerusalem, the domicile of Your name,
as it is written in the Torah of Moses, Your servant:
<i>Even if your outcasts are at the end of the heavens</i>
<i>the Lord, your God, will gather you and take you from there.</i>
<i>And the Lord, your God, will bring you to the land that Your forefathers inherited, and you shall inherit it,</i>
<i>and He shall benefit you and make your numbers greater than your fathers.</i>
<i>Then the Lord, your God, will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your offspring,</i>
<i>to love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul,</i>
<i>in order that you may live</i> (Deuteronomy 30:4-6).
Unify our hearts to love and be awed by Your name,
and to keep all the words of Your Torah,
and may You dispatch the son of David, Your righteous Messiah, to us,
to redeem those awaiting Your final salvation.
Appear with the glory and pride of Your strength
before all the inhabitants of Your world,
and may all who have breath in them say,
"The Lord, God of Israel, is the King,
and His kingdom is over everything."
Amen, selah. 

Prayer for Israeli Soldiers

May He who blessed our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
bless the soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces,
who are standing guard over our land and over the cities of our God,
from the border of Lebanon to the Wilderness of Egypt,
and from the Great Sea to the Approach of the Aravah — on land, in the air, and in the sea.
May the Lord give plagues before our enemies who arise against us.
May the Holy One, blessed be He, guard and rescue our soldiers from all trouble and distress, and from all affliction and illness;
and may He grant blessing and success to all the acts of their hands.
May He crush beneath them those who hate us and crown our soldiers with the crown of salvation and with the crown of victory.
And may the verse be fulfilled through them:
<i>For it is the Lord, your God, who walks with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you</i> (Deuteronomy 20:4).
And let us say, Amen. 

Prayer for Those Being Held in Captivity

May the One who blessed Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, David and Solomon bless, watch and guard those missing from the Israel Defense Forces and the captives,

Guy ben Rina Chaver,
Ron ben Batya Arad,
Yekutiel Yehudah Nachman ben Sarah Katz
and Tzvi ben Peninah Feldman,

among others of our brethren of the House of Israel that are situated in distress and in captivity. On account of the congregation's praying for them, may the Holy One, blessed be He, grant mercy upon them, take them out from darkness and gloom, break their chains, redeem them from their ordeals and return them quickly to the comfort of their families. "Let them praise the Lord for His kindness, and His wondrous deeds for the children of man" (Psalms 107:8). And through them, let the verse (Isaiah 35:10) be fulfilled, "And the Lord’s ransomed shall return, and come with shouting to Zion, crowned with joy everlasting; they shall attain joy and gladness, while sorrow and sighing flee." And let us say, Amen!

Birkat Hachodesh



Av HaRachamim


The merciful father who dwells upon high will mercifully judge the pious and the upright and pure, the holy congregations who gave up their lives in holy martyrship, who were loved and valued in their lives, and who in their deaths are not abandoned. [They were] lighter than eagles and mightier than lions in doing the will of their creator and the desire of their maker. Remember them for good, O our god, among all the world's righteous, and avenge the spilled blood of your servant, as it is said in the Torah of Moses, man-of-God, "Acclaim O nations his people, for the blood of his servants he will avenge, and vengeance will be repaid upon his enemies, and his army will cleanse his land." And upon the hands of his servants the Prophets it is written, "And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged; and the LORD dwells in Zion." And in the holy Writings it is said, "Why do the nations say, 'Where are their gods?' We will see the avengement of your servants' spilled blood made apparent to the nations." And it is said, "For the pursuer of blood will remember them; he will not forget the cries of the oppressed." And it is said, "He judges among the corpse-filled nations, head bowed over the great land. From a stream by the road he drinks -- only then does he lift his head!"

And the Seventh Day is for your god.

On the Sabbath do not do work,

For all was made in the six days.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.



First is it to the holy readings,

A day of Shabbaton, the holy Sabbath day!

Therefore all people with their wine sanctify it

over two loaves the pure ones cut.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.


Eat fats, drink sweets,

For god will give to all who grasp him,

clothing to wear, bread of the laws,

meat and fish and all delicacies.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.



Do not deny yourself anything on it, and eat

and be satisfied and bless

the LORD your god which you love

for he has blessed you above all other nations.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.


The heavens tell his glory,

and also the land is filled with his charity

See that all this his hand made,

for he is the Rock, his act is perfect.


This day is glorified above all days, for on it did rest the Rock of Ages.

Sukkot

Prayers in the Sukkah

Entering the Sukkah

Behold, I am ready and prepared to fulfill the commandment of the sukkah (hut), as the Creator, may his Name be blessed, commanded me - as is written (Leviticus 23:43-44), "You shall live in huts seven days; all citizens in Israel shall live in huts.
In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelite people live in huts when I brought them out of the land of Egypt."

Ushpizin

Sit, sit, [you] lofty guests; sit, sit [you] holy guests; sit, sit [you] guests of faith. Worthy is Israel's portion, as it is written (Deuteronomy 32:9), "For the Lord’s portion is His people, Jacob His allotment."

May it be Your will in front of You, Lord, my God and God of my fathers, that You have Your Divine Presence rest upon us, and that You spread out Your sukkah of peace upon us, in the merit of the commandment of sukkah that we are fulfilling in order to unify the name of the Holy One, blessed be He and His Divine Presence - with fear and love - to unify the name, <i>Yod Hay</i>, with <i>Vav Hay</i> on behalf of all of Israel; and to surround them with the radiance of Your holy and pure glory, spread over their heads above 'like an eagle protecting his nest.' And from there, may the flow of life flow to Your servant, [one's name], the child of [one's mother's name], Your maidservant. And in the merit of my going out of my house - 'I eagerly pursue Your commandments' - let this be considered as if 'I wandered far away' (thus suffering the atonement of exile), and 'wash me thoroughly of my iniquity and purify me of my sin.' And 'let Your ears pay heed' to many blessings of the lofty guests, the guests of faith; and give the hungry, even the thirsty, their bread and their dependable water. And give me the merit to sit and be sheltered 'in the hidden shade of Your wings,' at the time of my leaving the world, and to be 'sheltered from the torrential rain,' when 'You rain down blazing coals upon the wicked.' And let this commandment of sukkah that I am fulfilling be considered as if I had fulfilled it with all of its details, its exact specifications, its conditions and all the commandments that depend upon it. And make the sealing [of judgement] good for us, and give us the merit to dwell many days upon the ground, the holy ground, in Your service and in Your awe. 'Blessed is the Lord forever, Amen and Amen!'

<i>On the first night when one enters the sukkah before sitting to eat, and on every night before the meal, one should say:</i>
I am inviting the lofty guests, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David.

<i>On the first day, one says:</i>
If you please, Abraham, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the second day, one says:</i>
If you please, Isaac, my lofty guest, let all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David - sit with me and with you.
<i>On the third day, one says:</i>
If you please, Jacob, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the fourth day, one says:</i>
If you please, Moses, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Aaron, Joseph and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the fifth day, one says:</i>
If you please, Aaron, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joseph and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the sixth day, one says:</i>
If you please, Joseph, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and David - sit with me and you.
<i>On the seventh day, one says:</i>
If you please, David, my lofty guest, may all of the exalted guests - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Joseph - sit with me and you. 

Leaving the Sukkah

May it be Your will in front of You, Lord, our God and God of our fathers - in the same way that I have fulfilled [the commandment] and dwelt in this sukkah, so may I merit next year to dwell in the sukkah (made from the skin) of the Leviathan.

Blessing on Lulav

Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us about holding the lulav.
<i>The first time during Sukkot that one makes a blessing on the lulav, one should also bless the following blessing:</i>
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has granted us life and sustenance and permitted us to reach this season.

For Your sake, our God, please save; for Your sake, our Creator, please save!
For Your sake, our Redeemer, please save; for Your sake, our Seeker, please save!

The nation, guarded like the pupil of the eye,
contemplates the doctrine that restores the soul,
studies the laws of Shabbat,
interprets the carrying of Shabbat,
which establishes two thousand (ells) as the perimeter of Shabbat.
And [beyond this], it prevents its feet on account of the Shabbat.
It fulfills, "remember," and "guard," on the Shabbat.
It hurries to make haste [for] the coming of the Shabbat.
It busies itself [with] all from the six [days] for the Shabbat,
sits and waits until the end of Shabbat.
It calls Shabbat glory and delight;
it changes clothing and covering on the Shabbat;
food and drink does it prepare for the Shabbat,
enjoying pleasant foods for the Shabbat.
Three meals does it fulfill on Shabbat,
upon two loaves does it break [bread] on Shabbat.
It designates four domains on Shabbat.
It kindles [lights for] the commandment of lighting the candle on Shabbat.
It sanctifies the holiness (kiddush) of the day on  Shabbat,
prays the song of seven (paragraphs) on Shabbat.
It reads seven from the doctrine on Shabbat,
let it inherit the day that is completely Shabbat.
Please save!

<i>Ani Vaho</i>, please bring salvation! Like You saved Adam, the work of Your hands, as a Protector, on the holy Shabbat you found him atonement and clemency; like You saved the distinguished nation hoping for freedom, they intuited to choose the seventh [day] for repose; like You saved the people that You drove like sheep to refreshment, and You placed a law at Marah upon the waters of rest; like You saved Your privileged ones in the Wilderness of Sin in the camp, they were wise and collected double the bread on the sixth [day]; like You saved Your followers [who] instructed preparation from their intelligence, their Shepherd blessed their strength and conceded to them; like You saved those sustained in delight from that which was stored, it did not change its appearance and its aroma did not cease; like You saved those who studied the laws of carrying on Shabbat, they rested and ceased, keeping [the laws of] the domains and the perimeters; like You saved those who heard the fourth commandment [at] Sinai, the matter of "remember," and "guard," to sanctify the seventh [day]; like You saved the ones ordered in Jericho to encircle seven [times], they besieged it until it came down on Shabbat to be victorious; like You saved Kohelet and his people in the House of Eternity, they pleased You with their feasting seven and seven days; like You saved those who returned to arise from the exile to redemption, as they read Your Torah on the festival every day; like You saved those who made You rejoice in the new second [Temple], raising the lulav all seven [days] in the Temple; like You saved those that pushed off the pounding of the willow [on] Shabbat, they placed the willow branches of Motza at the base of the altar; like You saved those that rejoiced with soft, long and tall [willow branches], in their departure, they would praise, "Beauty is yours"; like You saved those who thank and hope but never alter, we all repeat, "We are His and our eyes are towards Him"; like You saved those that encircled the winepress of Your hewing with freshness, they hymn, "<i>Ani Vaho</i>, please bring salvation"; like You saved the army of careful ones who serve composed, the double sacrifice of Shabbat, [by sacrificing] the burnt-offering and the gift-offering; like You saved Your Levites singing upon their stand, saying, "A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat"; like You saved those comforted by Your commandments [which] always give them enjoyment, and You will placate and rescue them, and they shall be saved with ease and rest; like You saved the return of the tribes of Jacob - return and bring back the return of the tents of Jacob and, so too, please save! Like You saved the keepers of the commandments and those awaiting salvations - God of salvations - so too please bring salvation!

Deliver and bless Your people; tend them and sustain them forever (Psalms 28:9). And may these words of mine, which I have offered in supplication before the Lord, be close to the Lord our God day and night, that He may provide for His servant and for His people Israel, according to each day’s needs. In order that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord alone is God, there is no other (I Kings 8:59-60).

You saved the return of the tribes of Jacob - return and bring back the return of the tents of Jacob and, so too, please bring salvation! 
Like You saved the keepers of the commandments and those awaiting salvations - You are the God for the saved - so, so too please bring salvation!

<i>Ani Vaho</i>, please bring salvation!

Maoz Tzur


























Bare Your holy arm and hasten the End of salvation –
Avenge the vengeance of Your servants’ blood from the wicked nation.
For the time has delayed and there is no end to the days of evil,
Push away the Red One in the lowest shadow and establish for us the seven shepherds.

Selichot

Fast of Gedalia



Ten of Tevet

1. Forgive us, our Parent, because we made our mistakes through the multitude of our confusions. Forgive us, our Ruler, because our evil deeds are too many. 
2. You are a patient God, and you are called Master of Mercy. You taught us the path of repentance. Remember how great your mercy and your kindness are, today and every day, for the offspring of your dear one. Turn to us mercifully, because you are Master of Mercy. We will approach your presence with pleas and prayer, as you instructed the Humble One (Moses) in ancient times. Turn back from your hot anger, as it is written in your Torah. We will shelter and rest in the shadow of your wings, as on the day of, "and God descended in a cloud." Pass over iniquity, erase guilt, as on the day of, "and he stood with Him there." Listen to our cries, and hear what we say, as on the day of, "and he called out in the name of God," when it says: 
3. "And God passed before him and called out:
4. "God, God, Divine, Merciful, Generous, Patient, Abundantly kind and true, Preserver of kindness for thousands, Tolerator of evil deeds, wickedness, sin, and Cleanser." Forgive our evil deeds and our sins, and take us as your own. Forgive us, our Parent, because we have sinned. Forgive us our Ruler, because we have violated. Because you are Adonai- good, forgiving, and abundantly kind to all who call You. 
5. Because kindness is with God, and rescue is plentiful with Him. God, rescue Israel from all its distress. He will rescue Israel from all its evil deeds. God saves the lives of His servants, and those who take shelter in Him will not be found guilty. 
6. Like a parent has mercy on children- that is how You should have mercy on us, God. Salvation is God's, Your blessing is forever on Your nation. God of Multitudes is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge forever. God of Multitudes, how lucky is a human who trusts in You. God, save! The Ruler will answer us on the day we call. 
7. The leader says-
8. Please forgive the evil deeds of this nation, matching the magnitude of Your kindness, and the way You have carried this nation from Egypt to here. There it is said, 
9. The congregation says- 
10. "God said, "I have forgiven, on your terms."
11. Tilt your ear, my God, and hear; open your eyes and see our ruins, and the city called by Your name. We throw our pleas before You not because of our righteousness, but because of Your abundant mercy. God, hear. God, forgive. God, listen and act. Do not delay, for Your own sake, because Your name is called over Your city and Your nation.
12. Selicha organized alphabetically, with the author's name "Yosef" at the end
13. Our God, and God of our ancestors:
14. I will describe the distress that calls me. He hit me with three blows this month. He cut me down, prevented me, hit me. Even now, He wears me out. He depressed me on the Eighth, right and left. Did I not establish fasts on all three of the days? And the Greek king forced me to write my religion in Greek. "Those who plow use my back to plow, they make the furrow long." I fumed on the Ninth with deep-dug shame. He removed from me the cloak of glory and alacrity. The one who had said beautiful words was torn apart on that day. This was Ezra the Scribe. (Ezekiel) Ben Buzi the Visionary was commanded about the Tenth day. He wrote for You in his book of visions. For a remembrance for a nation who is melted and disgraced. "This very day." The count of the monthly calendar was awakened against me. I stretch out my mouth with dirges and wailing. The order of the tragedies will burn in my heart. When "the refugee came to me saying the city had been hit." About these, I throw dirt on my face. I have been wounded by these four things- if only I had shot an arrow into my heart! In distress over these, I dig myself a grave. "God is justified, because I transgressed his word." I called Your name, the One comforted about my evil doings. See my suffering, hear the voice of my supplication. Listen to my pleas, quicken my salvation. "Do not shut your ear to my cry for ease, to my appeal." In the month of Tevet I was very hard-hit. The order of its celestial paths were changed against me. I rebelled, I violated, but let Him reveal His goodness to me. The One who tells the sea, "You may come up until here." 
15. God, Ruler, who sits on a throne of mercy, who behaves piously, who forgives the sins of his nation, passing the first one first, who has abundant forgiveness to sinners, who acts justly with everything flesh and spirit, You will not repay them in accordance with their evil. God, you taught us to say the Thirteen, so remember for us today the covenant of the Thirteen, as you informed the Humble One (Moses) in ancient times as it is written, "and God descended in a cloud and he stood with Him there, and he called out in the name of God," 
16. "And God passed before him and called out:
17. "God, God, Divine, Merciful, Generous, Patient, Abundantly kind and true, Preserver of kindness for thousands, Tolerator of evil deeds, wickedness, sin, and Cleanser." Forgive our evil deeds and our sins, and take us as your own. Forgive us, our Parent, because we have sinned. Forgive us our Ruler, because we have violated. Because you are Adonai- good, forgiving, and abundantly kind to all who call You. 
18. God, nations have come into your possession, contaminated your holy Palace, and given over Jerusalem to those in poverty. God, wicked ones have risen up against us, and a congregation of strident ones seek to kill us, and nothing is available to oppose them. 
19. Like a parent has mercy on children- that is how You should have mercy on us, God. Salvation is God's, Your blessing is forever on Your nation. God of Multitudes is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge forever. God of Multitudes, how lucky is a human who trusts in You. God, save! The Ruler will answer us on the day we call. 
20. Selicha organized alphabetically, with the name of the author Abraham Bar Menachem Chazak
21. Our God, and God of our ancestors: 
22. The upper stone has turned into heaps to be plowed, and those who possess the inheritance have turned into the chief wanderers among the nations. Inside me, my heart hurts, injured and depressed, as we are left with no parent, become like orphans. Soft and dainty, surrounded by roses, but now she moans, given over to the opponent. She was like a widow, the faithful city, with innumerable children, who have been sold for no money. Dainty and soft, rising to royalty, whose suffering has extended for many years and days. The House of Jacob is plundered, boldly mocked, the joyful city belongs to those planting vineyards. Her thirst was satisfied with poison, in the hand of the evil people, the one as desirable as an olah-offering and as the spiced incense. She rejected and abandoned the Torah of my abandoning parent, and could not find rest during night or day. Mighty, Ultimate God, issue a proclamation commanding a return for Zion's fight, a year of repayment. "Restore our days like in antiquity," answer, ancient God, and whiten the red like fleece, stains like snow. Strengthen us with fear of You, and with observance of your Torah, and remember us with your salvation, God, full of mercy. 
23. God, Ruler, who sits on a throne of mercy, who behaves piously, who forgives the sins of his nation, passing the first one first, who has abundant forgiveness to sinners, who acts justly with everything flesh and spirit, You will not repay them in accordance with their evil. God, you taught us to say the Thirteen, so remember for us today the covenant of the Thirteen, as you informed the Humble One (Moses) in ancient times as it is written, "and God descended in a cloud and he stood with Him there, and he called out in the name of God," 
16. "And God passed before him and called out:
17. "God, God, Divine, Merciful, Generous, Patient, Abundantly kind and true, Preserver of kindness for thousands, Tolerator of evil deeds, wickedness, sin, and Cleanser." Forgive our evil deeds and our sins, and take us as your own. Forgive us, our Parent, because we have sinned. Forgive us our Ruler, because we have violated. Because you are Adonai- good, forgiving, and abundantly kind to all who call You. 
26. Pizmon organized with the author's name at the beginning of each stanza, Abraham Isaac Ephraim Chazak
27. When my ancestors trusted in the name of my Divine refuge, they grew and succeeded and produced fruit. But from the time that they were pushed out and acted nonchalant with Him, they were "lessening continuously until the tenth month." On the Tenth of the month, the Babylonian king neared, and laid siege to the holy city, and the Captain came close, I was given to be crushed and was tortured in shackles, and every month my music turned to mourning. 
28. The earliest firstborn was the first to be destroyed. She mentioned the name of others, and that sin caused this. She did not recognize My presence, and she was swept up in the stream. She labored like she was birthing her firstborn "at the time she lifted off to great heights."
29. God brought a day of evil and constriction. He commanded my enemies around me to pick off my infants. That day my heart softened and I had no strength to stop it, and He spoke to the prophet, "Tell a parable to the House of Rebellion."
30. He removed the mantle from those sitting at the gates. He burned his anger like fire and he lifted the crown, and threw the glory off of the Forest of Lebanon, and a stormy wind runs down the hairs of my flesh like nails. 
31. You were called the most beautiful, and now you are burnt. You stumbled in sin and your heart went backward. They tailed you and made you stumble, the first and second times, and you were never bandaged with a "little balm."
32. The faultless Refuge is justified, bearing the sin of the worn-out one. He flew from the cherub to the threshold, to the corner of the roof, because of the stain of sin, and their screams arrived. Their evil was as abundant as a tree producing fruit. 
33. The One who plans narratives strengthened all my opponents, because my days of doing evil were completed. I forgot about the repayment for my embarrassing youth, "who gives me my bread, my water, my linen and my wool." 
My opponents stretched open their mouths and swallowed my possession. They were much more powerful than me, and they drank and distorted my blood. Strangers oppressed me and did evil to my brothers, "the ones who say Destroy, Destroy," the children of Seir the Horite. 
They said, "Let's go destroy them and end their memory." Jealous, vengeful God, repay them, make them carry their destruction. Pay them in accordance with their deeds, make them too ashamed to hope, like a man dreaming a dream about three baskets of bread. 
My wound was not dressed, my murderous injury. My eye is darkened, scouting for my brightly colored Beloved. Has he not forgotten his anger forever? "Why has He acted this way, what is this anger?"
37. The Merciful One, my God, do not abandon forever. My days of mourning have lasted a long time, and my heart is still sighing. God, return to my tent, do not give up your place. Pay back the days of my mourning when you come to reward me. 
God, my given portion, sense my need for help. Open up my sackcloth, to dress me with joy instead. Bring my darkness to be lit up by your light, the breath of my desire, because you are my flame. 
39. Save my life from suffering and sighs, give rest to your nation, my Ruler, my Holy One. Reverse the fast of the Fifth month to be a respite, the fasts of the Fourth and Tenth to be rejoicing and happiness.

Birkat HaMazon




Praised are You, Lord our G-d, Ruler of the universe, who in goodness feeds the whole world with grace, kindness, and compassion.  G-d gives food to all living things, for G-d's kindness is for ever.  Because of G-d's continual great goodness, we have never lacked for food, nor may we ever lack it, for the sake of G-d's great name.  For G-d feeds and sustains all, does good to all, and prepares food for all of G-d's creations.  Praised are You, Lord, who feeds everybody.














Revere the Lord, you who are G-d's holy ones, for those who revere G-d lack nothing.  Scoffers may suffer starvation, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.  Praise the Lord for G-d is good; G-d's love endures for ever.  You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.  Blessed is the person who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is in the Lord alone.  Once I was young and now I am old, yet I have never watched a righteous person forsaken and allowed their children to go begging for bread.  May the Lord give G-d's people strength; may the Lord bless G-d's people with peace.

Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to affix the mezuzah.

And after he affixes it, he should kiss it and say, "This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall come through it" (Psalms 118:20).

Tefillat HaDerech

May it be Your will, Eternal One, our God and the God of our ancestors, that You lead us toward peace, support our footsteps towards peace, guide us toward peace, and make us reach our desired destination, for life, joy, and peace. May You rescue us from the hand of every foe, ambush, bandits and wild animals along the way, and from all manner of punishments that assemble to come to Earth. May You send blessing in our every handiwork, and grant us peace, kindness, and mercy in your eyes and in the eyes of all who see us. May You hear the sound of our supplication, because You are the God who hears prayer and supplications. Blessed are You, Eternal One, who hears prayer. 

Havinenu

(recite first three blessings of Amidah first, then say:) Grant us, Lord our God,  understanding to know Thy ways,
and open our hearts to Thy awe,
and forgive us, so that we may be redeemed,
and keep us far away from pain,
and satisfy us with the pleasant produce of Thy earth,
and gather our dispersed from the four (corners of the earth),
judge those who stray from Thy opinion,
and may Thy Hand be upon the wicked to humble them,
and may the righteous rejoice over the rebuilding of Thy City
and in the restoration of Thy Temple,
and in the flowering pride of David Thy servant,
and in the preparation of a lamp for the son of Jesse, Thy anointed Messiah,
before we call, may You answer,
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hears prayer. (Continue with last three blessings of Amidah)
