The Morning Prayers

Upon Arising in the Morning

<small><i>Upon waking in the morning, even before washing your hands, say:</i></small>
I give thanks to You
living and everlasting King
for You have restored my soul with mercy.
Great is Your faithfulness.
<small><i>After washing your hands, say:</i></small>
The beginning of wisdom is fear of Adonoy,
good understanding
to all who perform [His commandments],
His praise endures forever.
Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.
<small><i>Before putting on your </i>tallis katan<i> say:</i></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
concerning the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>tzitzis</i> (fringes).
May it be Your will
Adonoy, my God, and God of my fathers,
to consider [my fulfillment of]
the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>tzitzis</i> before You
as though I had fulfilled it
in every detail,
accurately and with full intent,
and the 613<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The numerical value of the word צִיצִית is 600 which, with the 8 threads and 5 knots of the צִיצִית itself, makes 613, the exact number of the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah. This symbolizes the Talmudic statement (Maseches Nedarim 25a) that the wearing of <i>tzitzis</i> equals the observance of the whole Torah.</i> commandments
that depend on it.
Amein, Selah.

Putting On the Tallis

<small><i>While examining the fringes of the </i>tallis<i> say:</i></small>
My soul, bless Adonoy,
Adonoy, my God, You are greatly exalted.
With beauty and splendor
are You clothed
enwrapped in light, garment-like;
You spread out the heavens like a curtain.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 104:1,2.</i>

Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with(His commandments
and commanded us
to enwrap ourselves with <i>tzitzis.</i>
<small><i>Cover your head with the </i>tallis<i> and say:</i></small>
How precious is Your kindness, God;
the children of men
take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
They will be filled
from the abundance of Your House,
and from the stream of Your delights
You will give them to drink.
For with You is the source of life,
in Your light shall we see light.
Extend Your kindness
to those who know You,
and Your righteousness
to the upright in heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 36:8-11.</i>

Putting on the Tefillin


<small><i>Place the "tefillin of the arm" on the muscle of your left arm, and before tightening it, say:</i></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us to put on <i>tefillin.</i>
<small><i>Wrap the strap around your arm 7 times and then place the "tefillin of the head" on your head above the region between your eyes, and say:</i></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments,
and commanded us
concerning the <i>mitzvoh</i> of <i>tefillin.</i>
<small><i>Then say immediately:</i></small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.
<small><i>With the "tefillin of the head" in place, say:</i></small>
And from Your wisdom, most high Almighty,
may You impart to me;
and from Your understanding,
give me understanding.
With Your lovingkindness,
do great things with me.
With Your merit,
cut off my enemies and opponents.
Pour bountiful oil
upon the seven branches of the menorah,
in order to cause goodness
to flow to Your creatures.
Open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
<small><i>When wrapping the strap around the middle finger of your left hand, say:</i></small>
And I will betrothe you to me forever;
and I will betrothe you to me
in righteousness,
in justice, in kindliness, and in mercy.
And I will betrothe you to me in faithfulness
and you shall know Adonoy.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 2:21-22.</i>
<small>The following chapters, found in Exodus 13:1-16, are recited while wearing the tefillin, since they make direct reference to the mitzvah of tefillin.</small>
Adonoy spoke to Moses, saying: "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever opens the womb among the Children of Israel, both of man and beast is Mine." And Moses said to the people: "Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for with a strong hand Adonoy brought you out from here, and [therefore] you must not eat <i>chametz.</i> This day you are departing, in the month of springtime. And it will be when Adonoy will bring you to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall perform this service in this month. Seven days, you shall eat matzos, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival [dedicated] to Adonoy. Matzos shall be eaten during these seven days, and no <i>chametz</i> and no leaven shall be seen in your possession within all your boundaries. And you shall relate to your son on that day, saying: ‘Because of this Adonoy acted on my behalf when I came out of Egypt. And it shall be for a sign upon your arm<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the arm with the tallis or hand. Some then kiss the tallis or hand as an act of <i>chivuv mitzvah</i>, affection for the mitzvah.</i> and for a reminder between your eyes<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the head. See previous note.</i> so that Adonoy's teaching will be [the words of] your mouth; for with a strong hand Adonoy brought you out of Egypt. And you shall keep this ordinance in its appointed time from year to year.
And it will be, when Adonoy will bring you to the land of the Canaanites as He swore unto you and to your fathers, and will have given it to you. Then you shall bring to Adonoy every one that opens the womb, and every firstling that is dropped by cattle that belong to you, the males shall belong to Adonoy, The firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you do not redeem it, then you must kill it by breaking its neck. You must redeem every firstborn of man among your children. And it will be when your son asks you in future times, saying: ‘What is this?' You shall say to him: ‘With a strong hand Adonoy brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. And it was when Pharaoh unyieldingly refused to let us go, that Adonoy killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man, to the firstborn of beast; therefore I sacrifice to Adonoy all that opens the womb that are males, and every firstborn of my sons, I redeem.' And it shall be a sign upon your arm,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the arm with the tallis or hand. Some then kiss the tallis or hand as an act of <i>chivuv mitzvah</i>, affection for the mitzvah.</i> and for <i>totafos</i> between your eyes,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It is customary here, to touch the tefillin of the head. See previous note.</i> for with a strong hand, Adonoy brought us out of Egypt.

Ma Tovu

<small><i>Before beginning the Morning Prayers you should say the following:</i></small>
I hereby accept upon myself
the positive commandment
to love my fellow Jew.
<small>The following verses from Scriptures are recited upon entering the synagogue, as though asking permission of God to enter and pray in His Holy place.</small>
How good are your tents, Jacob:
your dwelling places, Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 24:5. The Talmud (Maseches Sanhedrin 105a) relates that this verse contains Billam’s prophetic allusion to Jewish houses of study and worship.</i>
As for me, through Your abundant kindness
I will enter Your House;
I will prostrate myself
toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 5:8.</i>
Adonoy, I love the Dwelling, Your House,
and the place where Your glory resides.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 26:8.</i>
I will prostrate myself, and bow,
I will kneel<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These are three distinct degrees of worship, representing various levels of subjugation before God.</i> before Adonoy, my Maker.
May my prayer to You Adonoy
be at a favorable time;
God, in the abundance of Your kindness
answer me
with the truth of Your deliverance.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 69:14.</i>

Adon Olam

<small>This hymn has been attributed to R' Shlomo ibn Gabirol who lived in Spain during the eleventh century. While praising God's omnipotence and providence, it clarifies the meaning of the name Adonoy so that before proceeding to pray, each worshiper understands the significance of the God he is addressing.</small>
Master of the Universe Who reigned
before any creature was created.
At the time when all was made by His will,
then was His Name proclaimed King.
And after all things shall cease to be
the Awesome One will reign alone.
He was, He is,
and He shall be in glory.
He is One, and there is no second
to compare to Him, to associate [with Him].
Without beginning, without end,
power and dominion are His.
He is my God and my ever-living Redeemer,
the Rock of my destiny in times of distress.
He is my flag<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is to Him that I rally and through Him that I am identified.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> and my refuge;
He is the portion of my cup on the day I call.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He answers me.</i>
Into His hand I entrust my spirit
[both] when I sleep and when I awaken.
And with my spirit my body [too],
Adonoy is with me, I shall not fear.

Yigdal

<small>This hymn, written by Daniel ben Yehuda, who was a Dayan in Rome about 1300, is based on Maimonides' 13 principles of Judaism. According to Maimonides, failure to believe in a single one of these principles places one outside the pale of Judaism.</small>
<b>1) <i>the existence of God</i></b>
Exalted is the living God, and praised
He exists, and His existence transcends time.
<b>2) <i>God is One</i></b>
He is One, and there is no unity like His,
He is invisible, His unity is infinitive.
<b>3) <i>God is uncorporeal</i></b>
He is unlike the corporeal
or even the non-corporeal,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God can also not be compared to the angels.</i>
His holiness is beyond comparison.
<b>4) <i>God is Eternal</i></b>
He preceded every being that was created,
He was First,
and there was no genesis to His beginning.
<b>5) <i>God alone must be worshipped</i></b>
He is Master of the Universe to every creature,
(all) proclaim His greatness and His majesty.
<b>6) <i>Truth of Divine Prophecy</i></b>
The fullness of His prophecy, He bestowed
on those He treasured,
and in whom He gloried.
<b>7) <i>Moses was the greatest of all prophets</i></b>
There never arose in Israel
another like Moses,
a prophet who beheld God's image.
<b>8) <i>Divine revelation of the Torah</i></b>
The Torah of truth
the Almighty gave to His people
through His prophet,
the trusted one of His house.
<b>9) <i>The Torah is immutable</i></b>
The Almighty will not exchange
nor alter His Law.
Never will He offer any alternative.
<b>10) <i>God knows the acts and thoughts of man</i></b>
He scrutinizes and knows our secrets.
He beholds the end of a thing at its beginning.
<b>11) <i>Divine reward and punishment</i></b>
He rewards man with kindness
according to his deeds.
He sends evil to the wicked
according to his wickedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word “deed” is not applied to the wicked man. Since Divine reward and punishment are distributed with kindness, reward is granted to man not only for his deed, which may itself be insignificant, but also for the long range effect of that deed. He is punished, however, only for his act of wickedness, not for the consequences of his deed.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i>
<b>12) <i>Belief in the coming of the Messiah</i></b>
He will send our Messiah at the end of days,
to redeem all who await His final deliverance.
<b>13) <i>Divine resurrection of the dead</i></b>
The Almighty will revive the dead
because of His abundant kindness:
Blessed forever is His praised Name.

Blessings Upon Arising

Blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word “blessed” is similar in concept to the words: “merciful” or “gracious” when applied to God. Just as merciful means that He is merciful, the source of mercy; so too, blessed means that He is the source of blessing.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> are You, Adonoy<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Generally speaking, the name Adonoy is understood as it is pronounced—Adonoy—my Master, and indicates His rule and providence of the universe. When reciting the Shema however, one should bear in mind the written character of the Name which indicates God’s everpresent existence. He was—is—and ever will be.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i>
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
concerning the washing of hands.
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who formed man with wisdom<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This may mean either that man was formed by God’s wisdom, or that God formed man and endowed him with wisdom.</i>
and created within him openings
and hollows.
It is obvious and known
in the presence of Your glorious throne<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In refutation of those who claim that God is not concerned with earthly matters, we declare that even in the presence of His glorious throne, where He is surrounded by myriads of angels, He is aware of the mundane needs of each individual.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i>
that if one of them were ruptured,
or if one of them were blocked,
it would be impossible to exist
and stand in Your Presence
even for a short while.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who heals all flesh
and performs wonders.
My God!
the soul which You bestowed in me is pure;
You created it, You formed it,
You breathed it into me
and You preserve it within me.
You will eventually take it from me,
and restore it in me in the time to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This statement refers to the time when the dead will be resurrected.</i>
So long as the soul is within me
I give thanks to You, Adonoy my God,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it is said, “I will praise Adonoy with my life, I will sing to my God with my being” (Psalms 146:2).</i>
and God of my fathers,
Lord of all creatures,
Master of all souls.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who restores souls
to dead bodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to God’s restoring of the soul each morning following its departure while the person sleeps.</i>

Blessings of the Torah

Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The observance and fulfillment of His commandments makes a person holy.</i> us with His commandments
and commanded us
to be engrossed in the words of Torah.
Adonoy our God, please make pleasant
the words of Your Torah in our mouths
and in the mouths of Your people Israel.
And may we and our descendants
and the descendants of Your people
the House of Israel,
all be perceivers of Your Name
and students of Your Torah for its own sake.
Blessed are You, Adonoy
Who teaches Torah to His people, Israel.

Giver of the Torah!
And Adonoy spoke to Moses, saying,

May Adonoy bless you and guard you.
May Adonoy shine

And they shall set My Name
upon the Children of Israel,
and I shall bless them.
These are precepts<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah, Peah 1:1: Talmud Maseches Shabbos 127a.</i>
for which no fixed measure is prescribed:
[leaving] the corner [of a field unharvested],<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The unharvested produce was left for the poor; Leviticus 19:9.</i>
[the offering of] the first fruits,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:9.</i>

[performing] deeds of kindness,
and the study of Torah.
These are precepts,
the fruits of which man enjoys
in this world,
[while] the principal [reward]
is preserved for him in the World-to-Come.
They are:
honoring father and mother,
[performing] deeds of kindness,
early attendance in the House of Study
morning and evening,
providing hospitality to guests,
visiting the sick,
participating in making a wedding,
accompanying the dead [to the grave],
concentrating on the meaning of prayers,
making peace between fellow men
and between husband and wife—
and the study of Torah is equal to them all.

Akeidah (The Binding of Isaac)

Our God and God of our fathers,
remember us favorably before You
and be mindful of us for
deliverance and compassion
from the eternal high heavens.
Remember in our behalf, Adonoy, our God:
the love of our ancestors,
Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants;
the covenant, the kindness,
and the oath which You swore
to our father Abraham on Mount Moriah,
and the binding
of Isaac, his son
on the altar,
as it is written in Your Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 22:1-19.</i>
After these events,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These events refer to the previous nine tests by which God tested Abraham. This was to be the tenth and the most difficult test of all.—<i>Ha’amek Dovor</i></i>
God tested Abraham
and said to him, "Abraham!"
and he [Abraham] said, "Here I am."
He said, "Please, take your son,
your only one,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was Abraham’s only son by Sarah.</i>
whom you love—Isaac—
and go to the land of Moriah,
and bring him up as a burnt-offering
on one of the mountains
which I will designate to you.
Abraham awoke early in the morning,
saddled his donkey,
and took his two attendants<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael and Eliezer.—<i>Rashi</i></i> with him,
and also his son Isaac.
He split the wood of the burnt-offering,
and rose up, and went to the place
that God had designated to him.
On the third day,
Abraham lifted his eyes
and saw the place from afar.
Abraham said to his attendants,
You stay here with the donkey,
and I and the boy will go to that place.
We will prostrate ourselves [in worship]
and return<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham unwittingly prophesied that both of them would return.—<i>Rashi</i></i> to you."
And Abraham took
the wood of the burnt-offering
and placed it on his son Isaac.
In his hand he took
the fire and the knife,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word is <i>ma’acheles</i> (root: אכל = to eat) which means that it renders meat fit for eating through slaughtering the animal. Another interpretation is: his knife is called <i>ma’acheles </i>because we still enjoy (eat) the reward of Abraham’s virtue when he agreed to use it to slaughter his son.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
and they both went together.
Isaac spoke to Abraham his father
and said, "Father,"
and he said, "Here I am my son."
He said, "Here are the fire and the wood,
but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?"
Abraham said,
God Himself will show the lamb
for a burnt offering, my son."
And the two of them went together.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although Isaac understood that he was going to be slaughtered, “They went together”—with like hearts.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
They came to the place
that God had designated to him,
and Abraham built the<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah says that he built “the” altar not just “an” altar, to indicate that Abraham rebuilt the same altar which was originally built by Adam and used by Cain, Abel and by Noah.—<i>Targum Yonoson ben Uziel</i></i> altar there,
and arranged the wood,
and bound his son Isaac,
and placed him on the altar,
on top of the wood.
Abraham reached out his hand
and took the knife
to slaughter his son.
An angel of Adonoy called to him
from heaven
and said, "Abraham! Abraham!"
and he said, "Here I am."
He [God] said,
Do not harm the boy,
nor do anything to him;
for now I know
that you are one who fears God
and have not withheld your son,
your only one, from Me."
Abraham raised his eyes
and beheld a ram<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Tradition tells us that this ram was prepared for this purpose from the time of creation. Rashi (in Maseches Avos 5:6)</i>
after it had been caught in the thicket
by its horns;
and Abraham went and took the ram,
and brought it up as a burnt-offering
instead of his son.
Abraham called
the name of that place,
Adonoy will see;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets the following: “God will see the binding of Isaac and through its merit He will pardon Israel every year and rescue them from trouble. It will thus be said, “On this day,” by all generations that the ashes of Isaac are seen by God and serve as our atonement.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
as it is said [to] this day
On Adonoy's mountain, He will be seen.
An angel of Adonoy called to Abraham
a second time from heaven, and said,
‘I have sworn by Myself,' declares Adonoy,
‘that because you performed
this deed,
and did not withhold
your only son,
I will greatly bless you
and make your descendants as numerous<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">11 If these blessings were intended to increase the population of Abraham’s descendants, it was superfluous, since God had previously blessed him for that purpose. God here blessed the descendants of Abraham with the nobility of spirit and courage to fulfill the command to sanctify God even when self-sacrifice is required. Only the nation of Israel, Abraham’s children, were commanded to fulfill this mitzvoh, because of the legacy we inherited from him.—<i>Ha’amek Dovor.</i></i>
as the stars of the sky
and like the sand on the seashore,
and your descendants will inherit
the gate of their enemies.
Through your children, will be blessed
all the nations of the world,
because you heeded My voice.'"
Abraham returned to his attendants,
and they rose and went together
to Beer Sheva,
and Abraham dwelt in Beer Sheva.
<small>On a day when Tachanun is not said, the following paragraph is omitted.</small>
Master of the Universe!
just as our father, Abraham suppressed
his compassion
to do Your will with his whole heart,
so may your compassion suppress
your anger against us;
and may your compassion prevail
over your [other] attributes.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to God’s attribute of stern justice.</i>
Act with us Adonoy, our God,
kindly and with compassion.
In your great goodness
turn away your fierce anger
from your people, and from your city,
from your land
and from your territorial heritage.
Fulfill for us, Adonoy, our God,
the promise you made in your Torah,
through your servant, Moses,
as it says,
I will recall my covenant with Jacob,

Morning Supplications

A person should always be in fear of God,
privately as well as openly,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Some people conduct themselves in a God-fearing manner in the presence of others (in public), but in the privacy of their homes, do whatever they please. There are others who do just the opposite. In private they are governed by fear of God, but in the presence of others they are too embarrassed or intimidated to be God-fearing. A Jew must always fear God, in private as well as in public.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i>
[he should] admit the truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Acknowledging the truth is fundamental to serving God, and to all human behavior. One who is concerned merely with “winning the argument” will go to any extreme to come out on top. This attitude caused the downfall of the 250 leaders who joined Korach, rather than acknowledge the truth of Moses’ declaration (Numbers 16:2-35).—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i>
and speak truth in his heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It is not sufficient to merely acknowledge the truth verbally but one must speak truth in his heart as well. Rashi on the Talmud (Maseches Makos 24a) cites the following incident as an example of how one should speak truth in his heart: A buyer once offered to purchase an article from Rav Safra while he was reciting the Shema. Because he could not indicate his acceptance, the anxious purchaser increased his offer. Rav Safra refused the increment because in his heart he had already accepted the original offer.</i>
and rise early and proclaim:
Lord of all the worlds
and Master of masters!
Not on account of our righteousness
do we offer our supplications before You,
but on account of Your abundant mercy.
What are we? What is our life?
What are our acts of kindness?
What is our righteousness?
What is our deliverance?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Of ourselves or others.</i>
What is our strength? What is our might?
What can we say before You,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers?
Are not all the mighty men
as nothing before You?
Famous men as though they had never been?
The wise as if they were without knowledge?
And men of understanding,
as if they were devoid of intelligence?
For most of their actions are a waste,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In terms of achievement.—<i>Dover Sholom</i></i>

The superiority of man over the beast
is nil,
for all is futile.
Except the pure soul

All the nations are as nothing before you,
as it is written:
The nations are as a drop of a bucket—
no more than dust upon the scales

Behold, the isles are like the flying dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:15.</i>

to whom You swore on Mount Moriah;
the seed of Isaac, his only son,
who was bound on top of the altar;
the community of Jacob, Your firstborn,
[whom]—because of Your love for him
and Your joyous delight in him—
You named him Yisrael<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The name Israel symbolizes Jacob’s wandering through history proclaiming the sovereignty of God, while the name Yeshurun indicates his task to fulfill God’s will as revealed to him, and to devote his life to the execution of that which is right in the eyes of God.—<i>S.R.

and Yeshurun.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 33:5.</i>
Therefore, we are obligated
to thank You,

We are fortunate! How good is our portion!
How pleasant is our destiny!
How beautiful is our heritage!
We are fortunate

Korbanos (Sacrificial Offerings)

<small>The Talmud (<i>Maseches Menachos</i> 110a) states: Rabbi Isaac asked, "Why does it say (<i>Leviticus</i> 6:18; 7:1) This is the <i>law</i> of the sin-offering, this is the <i>law</i> of the guilt-offering? To teach us that when one <i>studies</i> the <i>law</i> of the sin-offering, it is considered as though he had actually brought it on the Altar, and when one <i>studies</i> the <i>law</i> of the guilt-offering, it is as though he actually brought it on the Altar."</small>
<small>Rather than merely recite the following portions, study them and attempt to learn about the laws and significance of the various sacrifices.</small>
<small>Exodus 30:17-21</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say:
Make a copper laver
and a copper base, for washing;
and place it
between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar,
and put water in it.
Aaron and his sons will wash from it,
their hands and their feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">His right hand was held above his right foot, the left hand above the left foot and all were washed simultaneously.—Maseches Zevachim 59</i>
Upon entering the Tent of Meeting
they will wash with water that they not die,
or whenever they approach the Altar
to serve, to burn a fire-offering to Adonoy.
They will wash their hands and feet
that they not die;
and this is for them a perpetual statute
for him [Aaron], and his descendants
for all their generations.
<small>The following Scripture section describes the removal of the ashes which had accumulated on the Altar from the daily burnt-offering of the previous afternoon. This removal was performed prior to the daily morning burnt-offering. The passage below also describes the ritual of maintaining the wood pyres which were always burning on the Altar.</small>
<small>Leviticus 6:1</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say:
Command Aaron and his sons to say,
this is the law of the burnt-offering.
This is the burnt-offering
[which must remain] on its pyre,
upon the Altar all night,
until morning,
and the fire of the Altar
will be kept burning on it.
The Kohein will don his linen garment,
and linen breeches upon his flesh,
and he will remove the ashes
when the fire consumes
the burnt-offering on the Altar;
and he will place them beside the Altar.
He will remove his garments
and don other garments,
and carry the ashes
outside the camp
to an undefiled place.
The fire upon the altar will be kept burning,
it may not be extinguished.
And the Kohein will burn wood on it
every morning,
and arrange on it the burnt-offering,
and burn on it the fats of the peace-offerings.
A constant fire
will be kept burning on the Altar,
it may not be extinguished.

Korban Tamid (Daily Offering)

<small>The <i>Tamid</i>-offerings, two daily offerings of one lamb at a time, were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The former was the first public-offering brought on the Altar each day. And the latter terminated the day's offerings. These animals were purchased from the annual half-shekel gifts of the people and were offered on behalf of the entire Jewish People. Before reading this passage we offer a brief prayer.</small>
<small>Some do not say the following prayer on Sabbath and Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
to have compassion on us,
to forgive us all our sins, [done unknowingly],
to atone all our iniquities, [done knowingly],
to pardon all our [malicious] transgressions,
and may You build the Holy Temple
quickly, in our days,
that we may offer, before You,
the daily burnt-offering to atone for us,
as You wrote for us in Your Torah
by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
from the mouth of Your Reverence,
as it is said:
<small>Numbers 28:1-8</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say:
Command the Children of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Kohanim, Levites and Israelites were to be present at the offering of the two daily public burnt-offerings. The Sages instituted the program of <i>Ma’amodos</i>, under which representatives of all 12 tribes were always present when these sacrifices were offered. These representatives were rotated each week.</i>
and say to them:
My offering, My food,
to be consumed by My fires,
a pleasing odor to Me,
You shall be diligent to bring unto Me,
at its fixed time.
And you will say to them:
This is the fire-offering
that you will bring unto Adonoy:
[male] lambs, in their first year,
without blemish,
two [of them] each day,
as a constant burnt-offering.
Offer one lamb in the morning,
and the second lamb,
offer in the afternoon.
And a tenth of an <i>ephah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">One-tenth of an <i>ephah</i> is the equivalent of 43-⅕ eggs.</i> of fine flour

mixed with oil of crushed [olives]
measuring one-fourth of a <i>hin.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>hin</i> is a liquid measure containing 12 <i>logs</i>, of which each <i>log</i> is approximately 6 eggs.</i>
[This is] a constant burnt-offering
as offered at Mount Sinai
for a pleasing odor, a fire-offering to Adonoy.
And its libation will be
a fourth of a <i>hin</i> for the one lamb;
in the Holy<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">On the Altar.</i> [Sanctuary] you will pour out
a drink-offering of strong wine to Adonoy.
And the second lamb
you will offer in the afternoon;
as the meal-offering of the morning
[together] with its libation, you shall offer
a fire-offering of pleasing odor to Adonoy.
<small>Leviticus 1:11</small>
And he will slaughter it
on the north side of the Altar,
before Adonoy;
and Aaron's sons, the Kohanim, will sprinkle
its blood all around the Altar.
<small>Some do not say the following prayer on Sabbath and Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
that this recitation be
important, acceptable
and desirable before You,
as if we sacrificed
the daily burnt-offering
at its proper time,
in its proper place
and according to its laws.
You are Adonoy, our God,
before Whom our fathers burned
the incense of spices
when the Holy Temple was standing,
as You commanded them
by the hand of Moses Your prophet,
as it is written in Your Torah:

Ketores (Incense Offering)

<small>Exodus 30:34-36</small>
And Adonoy said to Moses,
Take for yourself spices—
stacte, onycha, and galbanum—<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Galbanum has an offensive odor. The Torah includes it among the other spices to teach us to include even Jewish sinners among the rest of Jewry at our assemblies of fasting and prayers.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
spices, and pure frankincense,
[they] shall be in equal weights.
You will make it into incense,
a compound mixed by a compounder,
salted,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word, <i>memulach</i> is rendered by Onkelos as mixed, to indicate that the spices should be well mixed together.—<i>Rashi</i></i> undefiled, and holy.
You will pulverize some of it very fine,
and place it before the [Ark of] Testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This incense was offered each day upon the Innermost Altar which is inside the Tent of Meeting.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
in the Tent of Meeting,
where I will meet with you;
it will be to you holy of holies."
It is also written:
<small>Exodus 30:7-8</small>
And Aaron shall burn upon it [the Altar]
incense of spices every morning;
when he cleans the lamps
he will burn it.
And when Aaron lights the lamps
in the afternoon,
he will burn it;
a constant incense-offering before Adonoy
throughout your generations.
<small><i>Maseches Kreisos</i> 6a; <i>Jerusalem Talmud, Maseches Yoma</i> 4:5</small>
The Rabbis taught:
How was the incense compounded?
Three hundred and sixty-eight
<i>manim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>maneh</i> is a weight; plural, <i>manim</i>.</i> were comprised therein,
three hundred and sixty-five
corresponding to
the number of days in the solar year,
one <i>maneh</i> for each day—
half in the morning
and half in the afternoon.
From the three remaining <i>manim</i>
the Kohein Gadol brought
two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies]
on Yom Kippur;
[for which purpose] they were put back
into the mortar
on the eve of Yom Kippur,
and ground [again] very thoroughly,
in order to make them very fine.
Eleven kinds of spices were used for it.
They were:
1) balm, 2) onycha,
3) galbanum, 4) frankincense—
by weight, seventy <i>maneh</i> of each;
5) myrrh, 6) cassia,
7) spikenard and 8) saffron—
in weight
sixteen <i>maneh</i> of each;
9) twelve <i>maneh</i> of costus,
10) three of aromatic bark,
and 11) nine of cinnamon.
[Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine <i>kabin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kab</i> is a sixth of a <i>se’ah</i>.</i> of Carshina lye,
Cyprus wine [measuring]
three <i>s'in</i> and three <i>kabin</i>—
if he had no Cyprus wine,
he could use strong white wine—
a fourth of a <i>kab</i> of Sodom salt,
and a minute quantity of <i>maaleh ashan.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This herb causes the smoke of the burning incense to ascend in a straight line.</i>
Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says,
Jordan amber was added
of a minute quantity,
and if one added honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Included are various sweeteners such as dates and other fruits.</i>
it (the incense) became unfit;
and if one omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The same is true if one were to add to the prescribed number of eleven spices.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i> any of its spices
he was liable to the death penalty."<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The death penalty was given only if the Kohein Gadol actually entered the Holy of Holies with incense which was unfit. This was considered as an unwarranted entry into the Holy of Holies which carried the death decree.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says:
The balm is nothing but sap
which drips from the balsam tree.
the lye of Carshina was used
for rubbing the onycha
in order to refine its appearance.
The Cyprus wine was used
to soak the onycha
to give it a pungent odor.
Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">10 This water came from a well named Raglayim.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i>
was well suited for that purpose,
they did not bring
the water of Raglayim into the Temple
because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Mei Raglayim</i> (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—<i>Kol Bo</i></i>
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>:
Rabbi Nosson says,
While [the Kohein] ground [the incense]
he would say,
<i>‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,'</i>
because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices.
If half<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">184 <i>manim</i> instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared
it was acceptable,
but if only a third
or a fourth [of it was prepared]
we have not heard<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i> [whether it was acceptable."]
Rabbi Yehuda said,
This is the general rule:
If [it was prepared with all its ingredients]
in the correct proportion,
it is acceptable
even if only half was prepared;
but if he left out any of its spices,
he was liable for the death penalty.
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>:
Bar Kappara says,
Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three <i>manim</i> from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i>
the accumulated surplus was sufficient
to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense."]
Bar Kappara also taught,
If he would have put into it
a minute quantity of honey,
no one could have withstood [resisted]
the scent.
Why was no honey mixed with it?
Because the Torah says, (<i>Leviticus</i> 2:11)
For any leaven or honey,
do not burn from them,
[as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.
<small><i>Recite each of these verses three times:</i></small>
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob, Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts,
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver [us]!
The King will answer us on the day we call.
You are my shelter;
from distress You preserve me;
with glad song of rescue, You envelop me,
Selah!
Let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem,
as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Please, by the force of Your great right hand,
release the bound one.
Accept the prayer of Your people;
strengthen us, purify us, Awesome One!
Please! Mighty One,
those who seek Your Unity,
preserve them like the pupil [of Your eye].
Bless them, purify them,

Accept our prayer and hear our cry,
[You] Who knows hidden thoughts.
Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.
Master of the Worlds, You commanded us
to bring the Daily offering

and have the Kohanim perform their service,
and the Levites
[sing and play music] on the platform,
and the Israelites
[attend] at their Ma'amad.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">All of Israel was divided into twenty-four divisions. Representatives of each division—in rotation—spent one week at a time in Jerusalem in attendance upon the services of the daily offerings, which were offered on behalf of all Jewry.

And now, because of our sins,
the Holy Temple is destroyed,
and the Daily offering discontinued;
we have neither a Kohein at his service,
nor a Levite on his platform,
nor an Israelite at his Ma'amad.
Therefore let it be Your will
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
that the prayer of our lips
be considered, and accepted

and stood in attendance at its service,

Let the offering of our lips replace bullocks.
And it is said,
And he will slaughter it
on the north side of the Altar,
before Adonoy;
and Aaron's sons, the Kohanim, will sprinkle
its blood all around the Altar.
And it is said,
This is the law
of the burnt-offering,

in addition to the daily burnt-offering
and its libation.
<small>The following sequence of Mishnayos and the selection from <i>Sifra</i> "Rabbi Yishmael Says," were inserted after the Scriptural selections dealing with daily-offerings in order to give every Jew the opportunity to study/recite daily, the minimum of selections from Scripture, Mishnah, and Talmud. Even though <i>Sifra</i> is not actually a Talmudic tractate, it is a Tanaitic expansion of Mishnah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim</i> 50:1).</small>
<small>The following are <i>Mishnayos</i> found in the fifth chapter of <i>Maseches Zevachim.</i></small>

Where are the offerings slaughtered [in the Holy Temple?]
The holiest of offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">These include all burnt-offerings, sin-offerings and guilt-offerings.</i> are slaughtered

The remainder of the blood [in the vessel]

it did not prevent [atonement].

The communal and individual sin-offerings—
these are the communal sin-offerings:
The he-goats offered on Rosh Chodesh
and on the Festivals
are slaughtered on the north side,
and their blood must be received
in a sacred vessel, on the north side;
their blood requires four applications
[one] on each of the four corners.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Outer Altar.</i>
How [was this done]?
He [the Kohein] went up
the ramp [of the Altar]<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The ramp led up to the Altar from its south side. It was 32 cubits long and 16 cubits wide, and provided the Kohanim with access to the ledge which ran around the Altar, and upon which they were able to stand while performing their service.</i>

he came to the southeast corner,
the northeast corner,
the northwest corner,

the bringing of a sin-offering,
that this recitation

as if I had brought a sin-offering.
<b>MISHNAH IV</b>
The burnt-offering
is one of the holiest offerings.
It is slaughtered on the north side
and its blood is received in a sacred vessel
on the north side;
its blood requires two applications
which are [like] four.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The blood was applied against the southwestern and northeastern corners of the Altar and spread along both sides of each corner so that all four sides of the Altar received the blood.</i>
It must be skinned, severed into parts,

May it be Your will
as if I had brought a burnt-offering.

Communal peace-offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The communal peace-offering were the two lambs offered on Shavuos (Leviticus 23:20).</i>
and guilt-offerings.
These are the guilt-offerings:
the guilt-offering for robbery,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This offering was brought when a person denied and swore falsely that he had been entrusted with something for safekeeping.</i>
the guilt-offering
for unauthorized use of sacred objects,

<b>MISHNAH VII</b>
The peace-offerings are [also] of lesser sanctity.
They are slaughtered

<b>MISHNAH VIII</b>
Firstborn animals, the tithe of cattle
and the Passover-offering (Pascal lamb)
are [also] of lesser sanctity.
They are slaughtered
anywhere in the Temple Courtyard,
and their blood requires one application
provided that it is applied
above the base (of the Altar).<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The blood was applied on the wall of the Altar which was above the base. [Not all its walls were above the base.]</i>
They differ in their consumption:
The firstborn is eaten only by Kohanim,

They may be eaten anywhere in the city,
and prepared for eating in any fashion,
and may be eaten for two days and one night.
The Pascal lamb must be eaten only at night<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The night of Passover.</i>
and only until midnight;
and it may not be eaten
except by those registered for it,
and it may only be eaten when spit-roasted.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Never cooked, baked, rare, or raw.</i>
Rabbi Yishmael says:
through thirteen methods
the Torah is expounded:
1) A conclusion drawn from a minor or lenient law, to a major or more strict one.
2) A clarification based on identical words or terms in the Biblical text.
3) A principle derived from one Biblical text
or from two Biblical texts.
4) A rule followed by a detail.
5) A detail followed by a rule.
6) A rule followed by a detail,
which is in turn followed by a rule,
may infer only what is similar to the detail.
7) When a general rule requires an explicit rule;
when an explicit rule requires generalization.
8) Something included in a general rule,
which was singled out to teach—
was not singled out to teach about itself,
but to teach (something new)
concerning the rule as a whole.
9) Something that was included in a rule
and was singled out in a case
similar to its rule,
—it was singled out to lessen
not to increase the severity of the case.
10) Something that was included in a rule
and was singled out in a case
which is not similar to its rule,
—it was singled out either to lessen
or to increase the severity of the case.
11) Something that was included in a rule
and was singled out for a new stipulation—
does not revert to its rule
unless Scripture restores it to its rule
expressly.
12) A matter deduced from its context,
or from a subsequent expression.
13) Also, two passages that
contradict each other
until a third passage
reconciles them.
May it be Your will
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days:
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.

Kaddish d'Rabanan

<small>Kaddish is not the name generally given to this prayer in the Talmud. It is referred to there as "May His great Name...", because the congregational response beginning with these words is the heart of this prayer. Only in one minor tractate, (<i>Maseches Soferim</i> 16, 19, and 21) is it referred to as Kaddish.</small>
<small>Composed primarily in Aramaic, the language spoken and understood by most Jews in the Second Temple period (See <i>Tosafos</i> to <i>Maseches Berachos</i> 3a), nevertheless, several Hebrew phrases, which were familiar even to the unschooled, were also incorporated in the prayer.</small>
<small>This particular form of Kaddish d'Rabanan, is so named because of the insertion of the paragraph which begins with the words "Upon Israel and upon our Sages, etc." This Kaddish is recited following the study of Talmud or Midrash and invokes God's blessings on the Sages of Jewry, the transmitters of the Oral Torah.</small>
Exalted and sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These opening words refer to the fulfillment of God’s prophecy, through Ezekiel (38:23) “And I will thus exalt Myself and sanctify Myself; and I will be known in the eyes of the many nations, and they will know that I am Adonoy.”—<i>Levush, Siddur HaGra</i>. One should be very careful to emphasize the letter gimel (ג) when saying the word “Yisgadal (יִתְגַּדַּל),” in order that it not be heard as “Yis<i>k</i>adal (יִתְקַּדַל),” from the word קְדָל which means neck.—<i>Mishnah Berurah 56:2</i></i> be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">May His sovereignty be revealed.</i>

and hasten the coming of His Mashiach.
In your lifetime and in your days,

and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase, the heart of the Kaddish, is found almost verbatim in Daniel 2:20.</i>
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,

which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
Upon Israel, and upon our Sages,
and upon their disciples,
and upon all the disciples of their disciples,
and upon all those who engage in Torah study
in this land
and in every land.
May there be unto them and unto you
abundant peace, favor, kindness,
compassion, long life,
ample sustenance and redemption
from their Father
Who is in heaven and on earth,
—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and a good life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace
(<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace)
in His high heavens
may He, in His mercy, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.

Hodu

<small>The following sequence of prayers until Yishtabach (p. 94) is called <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i> (verses of praise). These selected Scriptural passages were arranged by the Gaonim of the ninth century, in fulfillment of the Talmudic statement (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 32a), "A person should always praise God first and make his requests [offer his prayers] afterwards." Beginning with the following prayer, it is forbidden to interrupt your prayer with conversation until after the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> (p. 118).</small>
<small>You are permitted to answer Amein, respond to <i>Barechu, Kaddish</i> and to say <i>Kedushah</i> even though you are in the midst of <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i>. You are also permitted to say <i>Modim d'Rabbonon</i> and the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> together with the congregation.</small>
<small>If you are concerned that the saying of <i>Kerias Shema</i> will not be within the proper time should you follow the regular order of prayers, you are permitted to recite the entire <i>Kerias Shema</i> during the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i>.</small>
<small>The first 28 verses of this section are taken from 1 Chronicles 16:8-36, and the first 15 are almost identical with the first fifteen verses of Psalms 105. These prayers are mentioned in <i>Maseches Soferim.</i></small>
Give thanks to Adonoy, proclaim His Name;
make His deeds<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Make His Divine attributes (mercy, kindness, etc.) known to the world.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> known among the nations.
Sing to Him, compose songs to Him,
speak of all His wonders.
Take pride<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Jew should be proud at being found worthy to utter God's Name.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> in [uttering] His holy Name,
let the heart rejoice
of those who seek<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Seeking God is an end in itself and provides joy to those who earnestly seek Him.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i> Adonoy.
Search for Adonoy and His might,
seek His presence continually.
Remember the wonders He has performed,
His miracles,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">His “miracles” were witnessed by Jew and Egyptian alike in Egypt. His “laws” are the Torah He gave us at Mt. Sinai.—<i>Iyun Tefillah</i></i> and the laws from His mouth.
[You,] the seed of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The entire section—the previous verses as well as the following verses—are addressed to the Jewish People, who are the seed of Israel, the chosen of God, who are asked to remember His wonders, miracles and laws.—<i>Tzelosa d'Avrohom</i></i> His servant,
children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
He is Adonoy our God;
the entire earth is governed by His laws.
Remember His covenant forever—
the word He commanded
to a thousand generations—
which He made as a treaty with Abraham,
and [which was] His oath to Isaac.
He established it for Jacob as a statute,
for Israel as an everlasting covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This verse in following the preceding verse indicates that the original covenant which God made with Abraham was later confirmed to Isaac in an oath and then established for Jacob as a statute. After Jacob was given the name Israel, it became an everlasting covenant.—<i>Tzelosa d'Avrohom</i></i>
Saying,
To you I will give the Land of Canaan,
the portion of your inheritance.
When you were only few in number—
very few, and strangers in it.
They wandered from nation to nation,

and do not harm My prophets."
Sing to Adonoy all the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Siach Yitzchok</i> maintains that this verse directs Jewry to sing to God in all the lands in which they are dispersed during their exile. <i>Tzelosa d'Avrohom</i> understands the verse to direct all the nations of the earth to sing to God.</i>
proclaim His deliverance from day to day.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">a) We are to proclaim our deliverance by God even 7 day; b) We are to proclaim that our deliverance by God is a <i>daily</i> experience.—<i>Tzelosa d'Avrohom</i></i>
Recount His glory among the nations,
His wonders among all the peoples.
For Adonoy is great and most extolled;
Awesome is He above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
whereas Adonoy made the heavens.
Beauty and splendor are before Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The word הוד (beauty) indicates that which is itself beautiful, while הדר (splendor) is the reflection of beauty. For example: the sun's light is “beauty” itself while the moon's light is splendor—a reflection of the sun.—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i>
strength and joy are in His presence.
Give to Adonoy families of peoples—
give to Adonoy glory and might.
Give to Adonoy the glory due His Name,
bring an offering and come before Him,
prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Etz Yosef</i> understands this as the “holy splendor” of God's Sanctuary. <i>Tzelosa d'Avrohom</i> sees it as the splendor and joy of worship before God, as contrasted with secular, frivolous manifestations of beauty and splendor.</i>
Tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth,
for He established the inhabited world
so that it cannot be moved.
The heavens will rejoice,
the earth will exult,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Simcha</i> (rejoicing) describes one's feelings at a new experience of happiness, whereas <i>gila </i>(exultation) describes the feeling one experiences over an ongoing situation of joy. Since there is nothing new on the earth ואין כל־חדש תחת השמש (Koheles 1:9), it is said the earth will exult (<i>gila); </i>but the heavens will rejoice (<i>simcha</i>) because there is חידוש in the heavens.—<i>Vilna Gaon</i></i>
and they will proclaim among the nations:
Adonoy has begun His reign.
The sea and its fullness will roar;
the field and all that is in it will jubilate.
Then the trees of the forest will sing with joy,
[receding] before Adonoy
when He comes to judge the earth.
Give thanks to Adonoy, for He is good,
for His kindness is everlasting.
And say, "Deliver us, God of our deliverance;
gather us and save us from the nations,
to give thanks to Your holy Name,
to be extolled in Your praise."<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that we are privileged to sing Your praises and cling to You will make us praiseworthy.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i>
Blessed is Adonoy, the God of Israel

and [they] praised Adonoy."
<small>(The following verses are a selection from the Psalms.)</small>
Exalt Adonoy, our God,

at His footstool.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Temple.</i>
Holy is He!<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Or Holy is it—i.e., the Temple.</i>
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves
at His holy mountain,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Mount Moriah, upon which the Holy Temple was built, is holy itself even when the Temple is destroyed. The previous verse refers to the time of the Temple, the second verse refers to the period of its destruction.—<i>Etz Yosef</i></i>
for Adonoy our God is holy.
And He, the Merciful One,
atones iniquity and does not destroy;
He frequently withdraws His anger
and does not arouse all His rage.
You, Adonoy,
withhold not Your mercy from me;
may Your kindness and Your truth<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">חסד (kindness) is the good God bestows without a promise, whereas אמת (truth) is the fulfillment of His promise.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i>
always protect me.
Remember Your mercies Adonoy
and kindnesses,
for
they are from the beginning of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">God's mercies to mankind started from the very day that Adam was created. God created the world in order to fill it with kindness as it is said: “A world of kindness was built” (Psalms 89:3).—<i>Rashi</i></i>
Give might to God,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Attribute your victories to God's might rather than to your own.—<i>Siach Yitzchok. Rashbam </i>and others hold that since God's actions are a reflection of Israel's deeds, the latter are, in a sense, the source of His might. Thus when Israel follows the wishes of God, they give might to Him.</i>
His pride (majesty) hovers over Israel,
and His might is in the clouds.
You are awesome, God,
from Your Sanctuaries,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">There is a spiritual Temple in the heavens which corresponds to the Temple on earth.—<i>Radak.</i> The Talmud (<i>Maseches Zevachim</i> 115b) notes that the word ממקדשיך may also be read ממקדשיך, <i>from Your holy people</i>, indicating that God is especially demanding of the most adherent to the Torah. When this occurs, the world is filled with awe and fear of God.</i>
Almighty of Israel—
He grants might and power to the people;
blessed is God.
Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy,
Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">These two verses (94:1-2) are an appeal to God during a time fraught with the sufferings of exile, when it seems as if God has forsaken His people. He is urged to reveal Himself as the Mighty champion of justice—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i>
Arise, Judge of the earth!
Repay the arrogant their just reward.
Deliverance is Adonoy's.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Only God knows what is true deliverance for a person. Prayer is not always answered, because God in His infinite wisdom knows that granting the request is not always for our benefit. We must therefore bless and offer thanks to God regardless of whether our petition has been granted.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i>
Upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah.
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah.
Adonoy of Hosts!
Fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver [us].
The King will answer us on the day we call.

<small>Psalm 30, once used to inaugurate the Holy Temple, is used today to inaugurate our daily prayers, for the synagogue is a "Holy Temple in miniature" and our prayers take the place of the sacrifices. It is both a prayer for success and a declaration of thanksgiving.</small>

<small>Psalm 100 was recited in the Temple only on those days when thank-offerings were offered on the Altar.It is therefore omitted on Shabbos, on Yom Tov, on the day before Yom Kippur, on the day before Pesach, and also on the intermediate days of Pesach, when only obligatory-offerings were offered.</small>
<small>Our Sages declare (<i>Midrash Rabbah Tzav,</i> 9) "In the future, even though all things on earth will be in such an ideal state that there will be no more cause for prayers and offerings, prayers of gratitude, and offerings of thanksgiving will nevertheless not cease."</small>
<small>Ordinarily, when a person is saved from a fatal illness, is released from captivity, or returns from a risky journey, he pronounces the special blessing <i>Hagomeil</i> (see page 177). Our Sages, instituted psalm 100 in our daily prayers as an expression of thanks for the many unrecognized miracles God performs in our behalf every day.</small>
<small>The following Psalm is omitted on Shabbat, Festivals, the day before Pesach, Chol HaMoed, Pesach and the day before Yom Kippur.</small>

Ashrei

<small>Rav S.R. Hirsch writes that the six concluding chapters of the Book of Psalms are the most important gift of David's Divinely-inspired hymns that Israel treasures so greatly. These six psalms, 145-150, are an essential component of our daily prayers. Our Sages attach much significance to Psalm 145 in particular, and stated: "Whoever recites ‘A praise by David' three times a day is assuredly worthy of a share in the world to come" (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 4b). When recited in prayer this psalm is always introduced with two verses from other Psalms (84:5 and 144:15). These verses contain the word fortunate three times, an allusion to this psalm being recited three times a day. These verses are so closely identified with Psalm 145 that it is commonly referred to as <i>Ashrei</i> (Fortunate).</small>
Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse referred to the Kohanim and the Levites who served (dwelt) in the Holy Temple (Your House); it is at all times applicable to scholars and devout men who study and pray in houses of worship and study.</i>

He did not do so to any [other] nation;

Praise God.

<small>The following selections are additions to the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah.</i> The custom of reciting them is mentioned as early as the Gaonic era, specifically by Rav Amram Gaon.</small>
<small>The first four verses (1 Chronicles 29:10-13) relate David's blessing to God, when he presented the gold, silver, and jewels he amassed for the construction of the Holy Temple. It was a day of great rejoicing as, following David's example, the leaders and princes also presented generous gifts for the construction of the Temple.</small>
<small>These verses were incorporated into our daily prayers because they speak so eloquently of God's majesty, and of the Divine providence which is the source of the power, riches, might, and honor of all human beings.</small>
<small>The following until after ישתבח should be said standing.</small>
And David blessed Adonoy
in the presence of all the assembly;

Shiras Hayam

<small>In Temple times Shiras Hayam, the Song of the Sea, was sung by the Levites when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maseches Rosh Hashanah</i> 31a, mentions that the Ode was sung at <i>Minchah</i> on Shabbos.</i> After the destruction, the Jews of the Holy Land continued the tradition, reciting the Shira at the end of the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah.</i> The custom spread to Italy and from there to other Jewish communities. This daily recital is mentioned by Rav Saadya Gaon but not as an obligatory part of the service. Rambam calls it a "custom."<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hilchos Tefillah</i> 7:13.</i> Subsequently adopted by all communities, reciting the Shira became an integral part of our daily prayers.</small>
<small>Some hold that the Shira should be chanted aloud while standing. It should be sung with joy as at the time of the Exodus. <i>"Sheloh"</i> writes that reciting the Shira atones for sin, so that if one wishes to repent a serious sin, he should recite the Shira every day with great fervor. The <i>Zohar</i> says, "If one recites this song with elation and joy, he will be worthy to sing it in the next world. He will also be worthy to sing it when he greets the Messiah."</small>
On that day,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even though they had been freed a week earlier, they were insecure, fearing that the Egyptians would capture and re-enslave them.

awesome in praise, performing wonders.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God is “awesome in praise” for we fear that all our praise will prove inadequate. In truth, it is impossible to praise God fully, and David therefore said (Psalms 65:2) “For You, silence is praise.”<i>—Rashi</i></i>
You stretched out Your right hand,
the earth swallowed them.
You led in Your kindliness,

all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Nations on all sides panicked: The Philistines to the west, the Edomites to the south, the Moabites to the east and the Canaanites to the north. The Philistines feared revenge. The Edomites panicked because they feared that Israel would now seek revenge for what Esau (Edom) had done to Jacob. The Moabites, the descendants of Lot, feared they would be punished because of the dispute between Lot and Abraham (Genesis 13:7). Canaan “melted away” because they realized that Israel was destined to take their land, and their astrologers told them that there was no way out.—<i>Rabbeinu Bachya</i></i>
Terror and dread fall upon them;
at the greatness of Your arm
they were still as stone;

For the kingship is Adonoy's
and He rules over nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 22:29. The word “king” signifies one whose leadership is accepted freely by all his subjects. Therefore, in reference to Israel who willingly accept the Kingship of God, it says, “For the kingship is Adonoy's.” A “ruler,” however, is one who forcibly rules people, without their consent. Regarding the nations who do not willingly submit to Adonoy's Kingship, the Psalmist says, “And He <i>rules</i> over nations.”<i>—Vilna Gaon</i></i>
And deliverers will go up to Mount Zion

Out of the depths
I have called to You, Adonoy.
My Master, hear my voice;
let Your ears be attentive

If You God should take account of iniquities,
my Master, who could survive?
For with You is forgiveness,
in order that You be feared.
I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes;
and for His word, I wait.
My soul [waits] for my Master

for the morning,
[more than] the watchman [waits]

Wait, Israel, upon Adonoy,
for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness,
and with Him there is much redemption.
And He will redeem Israel
from all its iniquities.
<small>The Half-Kaddish is recited by the Chazzan</small>
<small>Here, as elsewhere in the Liturgy, the Half-Kaddish marks the end of a distinct section of the prayers, in this case, the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah.</i></small>
<small>It is called the Half-Kaddish, the final three verses of the complete Kaddish having been omitted.</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name

according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming if His Messiah

and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,

The Blessings of Shema

<small>It has become a universally-accepted custom to recite <i>Barechu</i> before proceeding to the blessings of <i>Shema. Barechu,</i> like <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>Kedushah,</i> cannot be recited unless a quorum—a <i>minyan</i> of ten adult males—is present. <i>Barechu</i> is also said by one who is called upon to read from the Torah.</small>
<small>The practice of saying <i>Barechu</i> is mentioned numerous times in the Talmud. It is even cited in the Mishna (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 49b) in the names of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael.</small>
<small><i>The Chazzan says:</i></small>
<b>Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.</b>
<small><i>The Congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</i></small>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed
forever and ever.
<small>The two blessings יוֹצֵר אוֹר "He Who forms light" and אַהֲבָה רַבָּה "Great love," are referred to as the blessings preceding Shema (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11a). According to Rambam they were formulated by Ezra and his Court (<i>Laws of Shema</i> 1:7).  </small>
<small>You may not interrupt your prayers from this point on until after the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>. But you may answer "Amein" to the blessings of  הָאֵל הַקָּדוֹשׁ  "The holy Powerful One" and  שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָּה  "He Who heeds prayer;" say the thrice-repeated  קָדוֹשׁ  "Holy  …" and  בָּרוּךְ כְּבוֹד  "Blessed is the glory  …" of <i>Kedushah</i>; and answer <i>Barechu.</i> You may also answer  אָמֵן יְהֵא שְׁמֵהּ רַבָּא  "Amein, May His great Name," when you hear Kaddish." You may also answer Amein after the blessings of  יוֹצֵר הַמְּאוֹרוֹת, "Who forms the luminaries," and  הַבּוֹחֵר בְּעַמּוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּאַהֲבָה  , "Who chooses His people Israel with love."  </small>

from His place.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 3:12. According to the <i>Kuzari,</i> God's glory is a euphemism for God Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: God is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the <i>Kuzari</i> is that “God's glory” includes the angels. His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called God's glory, similar to a king's retinue, which is his royal splendor.</i>
To the Blessed Almighty,
they<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The angels.</i> offer pleasant melodies;
to the King, the Almighty,
[Who is] living and enduring,
they utter hymns
and make praises heard.
For He alone, exalted and holy
is the Performer of mighty deeds,
Maker of new things;
Master of battles,
Sower of acts of righteousness,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Pinchos ben Ya'ir was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchos ben Ya'ir planted the barley seed, and each year replanted the previous year's harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchos told him, “Come I will show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” God does the same with the good and righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his reward, God returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends.—<i>Midrash Rabba, </i>Deuteronomy 3:6</i>
Causer of deliverance to sprout forth;
Creator of cures.
Awesome in praise, Master of wonders,

Who makes the great luminaries,"

and may we all soon be privileged
to [enjoy] its brightness.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Former of the luminaries.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—<i>Kuzari</i></i>
<small>In the second of the blessings that precede <i>Shema</i> we praise God for His goodness in giving us His Torah, and pray for His help in the study of Torah. None of our petitions for the material goods of life approaches the fervor of this prayer for knowledge of the Torah and steadfastness in obeying it.</small>
[With] everlasting love You have loved us<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Kuzari</i> writes, “When reciting the blessing ׳Unbounded Love’ אהבה רבה, one should bear in mind that God's Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of God's will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called “love.”</i>
Adonoy, our God;
[With] great and abundant pity<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">God bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden calf. He not only pardoned us, but gave us the Second Tablets and ordained the construction of the Tabernacle (<i>Mishkan</i>) for His Divine Presence to dwell among us.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i>
have You pitied us.

Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who chooses His people Israel with love.

Recitation of Shema

<small>The recitation of Shema was part of the daily worship in the Holy Temple, and our Sages ordained that it be recited in the synagogue service, providing it a central place in the morning and evening prayers of each Jew. Its importance may be judged from the fact that the very first Mishnah in the Oral Torah opens with the question, "From what time may the evening Shema be read?"</small>
<small>In reading Shema, bear in mind that you are performing a Scriptural commandment. All three paragraphs should be read with <i>kavanah,</i> concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews' complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God's Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָל֯־לְ֯בָבְךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.  </small>
<small><i>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</i></small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Israel:</b>
<b>Adonoy is our God,</b>
<b>Adonoy is One.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שמע and last letter of אחד arc written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to God's oneness.—<i>Avudraham</i><br>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all of one's thoughts on God's oneness. The last word, אחד, “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that God, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Israel, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i>
<small><i>The following two lines are to be said silently:</i></small>
Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,׳ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Israel” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Jacob said, “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moses did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Jacob ordained it?” Thus, the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—<i>Maseches Pesachim</i> 56a.<br>When Moses went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise God by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say ברוך שם aloud.—<i>Midrash Rabba</i> to <i>Deuteronomy</i></i>
And you shall love Adonoy your God
with all your heart<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages (<i>Sifrei</i> to Deuteronomy 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to God's Law and make them instruments for His service.</i>
and with all your soul<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved God with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.</i>
and with all your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to God and to Torah might entail.</i>
And these words
which I command you today,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The teachings of the Torah should be ever fresh in your minds, as though you received it <i>today</i>.—<i>Ibid.</i></i>

And you shall teach them sharply<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See to it that your children have a clear, and not a confused, stammering knowledge of the Torah.—<i>Ibid.</i></i>
to your children.
And you shall discuss them
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall bind them for a sign
upon your hand,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:5-9. This paragraph contains 10 commandments: 1) accepting the “yoke” of heaven; 2) proclaiming the Unity of God; 3) loving God; 4) studying Torah (and you shall speak of them); 5) teaching your children; 6-7) reciting Shema in the evening and in the morning; 8-9) putting on the <i>tefillin</i> of the hand and head; 10) putting up <i>mezuzos</i> on the door-posts.</i>
And it will be—
if you vigilantly obey My commandments
which I command you this day,
to love Adonoy your God,
and serve Him
with your entire hearts<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The service of the heart is prayer, as David said (Psalms 141:2) “May my prayers be acceptable to You as an incense [service].”</i>

Beware lest your hearts be swayed<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">One who is satisfied can easily be induced to forget the Source of his fullness.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
and you turn astray,
and you worship alien gods
and bow to them.
And Adonoy's fury will blaze among you,
and He will close off the heavens
and there will be no rain
and the earth will not yield its produce;
and you will perish swiftly<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">No extension will be given. The “generation of the flood” was granted a reprieve of 120 years (Genesis 6:3) because they did not have from whom to learn; but you do have from whom to learn.—<i>Sifrei,</i> cited by <i>Rashi</i></i>
from the good land
which Adonoy gives you.
Place these words of Mine<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Even in exile you must fulfill God's commandments<i>—Sifrei</i> cited by <i>Rashi</i></i>
upon your hearts and upon your souls,—
and bind them for a sign

when you sit in your house,

and upon your gateways.
In order that your days be prolonged,

which Adonoy swore to your fathers
to give them [for as long]
as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying:
Speak to the children of Israel,
and tell them<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda bar Chaviva said that this third section was added to <i>Shema</i> because of six important things contained therein: 1. the commandment of fringes, 2. mention of the Exodus, 3. the call to assume the yoke of God׳s commandments, 4. the warning against heretical concepts, 5. the warning against straying after sinful desires, and 6. the warning against idolatrous worship.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 12b</i>
to make for themselves fringes
on the corners of their garments
throughout their generations;
and they will place with the fringes
of each corner
a thread of blue.
And it will be to you for fringes,

all the commandments of Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Meir says: “The blue thread of the fringes resembles the sea, the sea reflects the heavens, and heavens resemble the Throne of Glory” (<i>Sifrei</i>).

<small>You must be careful to connect the last words of Shema, ה' אֱלֺקֵיכֶם (Adonoy, your God), with the word אמת (is true) without pause or interruption so that these three words form one sentence, meaning "Adonoy your God is true" (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 13a).</small>
—is true—
<small><i>The chazan repeats:</i></small>
Adonoy, your God, is true.
<small>The following prayer, which culminates with  גָאַל יִשְׂרָאַל, Who redeemed Israel, constitutes the "Blessing after Shema" mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 11a). It is also mentioned in <i>Maseches Tamid</i> (32b) as part of the morning service in the Temple.</small>

Thus we say in the following prayer: “For our fathers, for us, for our children and for our descendants—Your word is good and lasting—a Law that will never be abrogated.”—<i>Kuzari</i></i>
His words are alive and enduring,

<small>When reciting <i>Shemoneh Esrei,</i> you must adhere to these rules:</small>
<small>1. Before beginning the prayer, take three steps backwards and then return to your former position. Upon completing the prayer, take three steps backwards and return.</small>
<small>2. Keep your feet together.</small>
<small>3. Concentrate on the meaning of the words you are uttering. Remove all distracting thoughts and worries from your mind.</small>
<small>4. You may not interrupt <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> by talking, not even by answering Amein. If you should hear <i>Kedushah, Kaddish,</i> or <i>Barechu</i> while saying the <i>Shemoneh Esrei,</i> you should remain silent and listen to the Chazzan's words.</small>
<small>5. At the beginning and end of the first blessing, at the beginning and end of the blessing that begins: "We are thankful to You," (page 133) and ends with "The Beneficent is Your Name," (page 140) we half-kneel and bow in the following manner: At the word "Blessed," bend your knees; at the word "You," bend forward until the vertebrae of your spinal cord are loosened; at "Adonoy," return to your upright position in keeping with the verse, "Adonoy straightens the bent" (Psalms 146:8).</small>
<small>6. Each individual recites <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> in silence. Only the prayer leader, the <i>Chazzan,</i> ever recites it aloud, and then only after the entire congregation, himself included, has recited it silently.</small>

<small><i>From the Musaf of the first day of Pesach until the Musaf of Shemini Atzeres one should say:</i></small>
He causes the dew to descend.
<small><i>From the Musaf of </i>Shemini Atzeres<i> until the </i>Musaf<i> of the first day of Pesach you should say:</i></small>
Causer of the wind to blow
and of the rain to fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God's might is as much manifested in causing the rain as it is in reviving the dead. In fact the Talmud (<i>Maseches Taanis</i> 7a) declares in the name of Rabbi Avohu: “The day when rain falls is greater than the day of the resurrection of the dead.” Rabbi Yochanan said, (<i>Ibid,</i> 2a): “There are three ׳keys’ which God retains in His own hands and does not entrust to any emissary: the key to rain, the key to childbirth, and the key to the resurrection of the dead.”</i>
<small>If you neglected to say this, and became aware of your omission before saying the blessing מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים, "the Resurrector of the dead," you must say it at that time. If you reminded yourself after saying  וְנֶאֱמָן אַתָּה "You are faithful," you must repeat it and then complete the blessing of  מְחַיֵּה הַמֵּתִים. If you became aware of your omission after starting the blessing אַתָּה קָדוֹשׁ "You are holy," even if you only said the word "You," say the Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning. If during the first thirty days after <i>Shemini Atzeres</i> you are in doubt whether you said it, you must assume that you didnot say it. After thirty days, however, since you have become accustomed to saying it, you may assume that you recited the proper phrase and you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei.</small>
Sustainer of the living with kindliness,
Resurrector of the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The most extraordinary manifestation of God's might—to our perception—is when He restores the dead to life. <i>Avudraham</i> writes that the three following praises represent various examples of how God restores life to those who arc near death. When a person falls (either physically or morally) he is often near death; thus, when God supports the fallen he restores their lives. When a person is sick, he often faces death, so when God heals the sick He restores their lives. A person who is imprisoned—i.e., confined—is like dead; thus when God releases the imprisoned He restores their lives.</i> with great mercy,
Supporter of the fallen,
and Healer of the sick,
and Releaser of the imprisoned,
and Fulfiller of His faithfulness
to those who sleep in the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Just as God shows His faithfulness to the living, so too will He keep faith with the dead who lie in the dust. Others say that “Those who sleep in the dust” refers to the Patriarchs; God will remember the oath He made to them and keep His promises to them.—<i>Avudraham</i></i>
Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds,
and who can be compared to You?
King Who causes death and restores life,
and causes deliverance to sprout forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deliverance will “grow” in stages rather than all at once.</i>
<small><i>(During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</i></small>
Who is like You merciful Father,
Who remembers His creatures for life,
in His mercy)
<small>If you forgot to say this, the same law applies as above concerning "Remember us for life."</small>
And You are faithful<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">How remarkable is the Jew's conviction of God's faithfulness. When the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing of “Resurrector of the dead,” the Jew responds, “Amein” even though he has not seen God restore the dead to life; when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Redeemer of Israel,” he responds “Amein”, even though he has not yet been delivered; and when the <i>Chazzan</i> says the blessing “Builder of Jerusalem,” he responds “Amein” even though Jerusalem has not yet been rebuilt.—<i>Midrash Tanchuma</i></i>

<small>If you mistakenly said, "the Almighty" instead of "the King," or if you are in doubt—if you realized your error after a lapse of time sufficient to utter a three word greeting (Shalom Aleichem Rebbe), or if you had already started the next blessing, you must say the Shmoneh Esrei from the beginning.

<b>PRAYER FOR UNDERSTANDING</b>
You favor man with perception<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing “You favor man with perception” begins the group of thirteen petitions which make up the “intermediate” section of <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> The first six petitions (blessings 4-9) are for our individual needs and well-being: understanding, repentance, forgiveness of sins, deliverance from trouble, from illness, and from want. Though these six petitions are of a personal nature, they voice the needs of all mankind. Note that the worshipper prays for his spiritual needs—knowledge, repentance, and forgiveness before he prays for his physical wants.</i>

God desires penitence as it is written, “I do not desire the death of the wicked: but (rather) that the wicked return from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11).</i>
<b>PRAYER FOR PARDON</b>
Pardon<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Sin can only be pardoned after repentance. Hence, the order of these two petitions. Even if a person was the worst of sinners, his supplication (after repentance) makes him fit to receive Divine mercy and helps him attain it—<i>R’ Yosef Albo</i></i> us, our Father, for we have sinned,

and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,

The Beneficent is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.
<small>To be said by the Chazzan</small>
<b>Birkas Kohanim<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">In Leviticus 9:22, we find that after he completed the Divine offering, Aaron lifted up his hands and blessed the people. In a like manner, his descendants, the <i>Kohanim,</i> uttered the priestly blessing after performing the Temple Service. In our days, on the occasions when the <i>kohanim</i> recite the priestly blessings, they do so immediately after the “We are thankful” prayer which terminates the <i>Avodah</i> (Service) section of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> When <i>Kohanim</i> do not recite the blessings, the blessings are mentioned by the <i>Chazzan</i> in his repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>.—<i>Avudraham</i></i></b>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us
with the threefold blessing of the Torah,
written by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
pronounced from the mouth of Aaron
and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people;
as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i> paraphrases this blessing with the words יכבש כעסו, “May He withhold His anger.”</i>
<small><i>After Birkas Kohanim the congregation says:</i></small>
Mighty One on high who dwells in might,
You are peace and Your Name is peace.
May it be Your will that You grant us
and all of Your people, the House of Israel
life and blessing
for a safeguard to peace.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>Birkas Kohanim</i> concludes with a blessing for peace, this concluding blessing is a restatement of the last benediction in the form of a congregational prayer.—<i>Pesher Dovor</i></i> goodness, and blessing,
life favor, kindness and compassion
upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one
with the light of Your countenance.
For by the light of Your countenance
You gave us Adonoy our God,
a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">One of the most important <i>mitzvos</i> of the “Torah of Life” is the mitzvah of doing kindness. But it is incomplete unless there is a love of kindliness in the heart which precedes the act of kindliness.—<i>Pesher Dovor</i></i>
righteousness, blessing, compassion,
life, and peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace
(with much strength and peace).
<small><i>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</i></small>
In the book of life, blessing, peace
and abundant maintenance,
good decrees, salvations and condolences,
may we be remembered and inscribed
before You;
we and all Your people, the House of Israel
for a good life and peace.
<small>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was the personal meditation of Mar the son of Ravina, which he recited after he completed his prayers (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 17a), and it is therefore expressed in the singular. The Jew prays that his mouth, his tongue, and his lips, which have just served as the instruments for his communion with God, will not forfeit any of their moral purity in his dealings with his fellow men<i>—Yaavetz</i></i>
and my lips from speaking deceitfully.
To those who curse me,
may my soul be unresponsive;
and let my soul be like dust to all.
Open my heart to Your Torah
and let my soul pursue Your commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">May I have an open, receptive and understanding mind and spirit in the study of Torah. When it comes to <i>mitzvos,</i> let my soul know no indifference, indolence, or passivity.

And all who plan evil against me,
quickly annul their counsel
and frustrate their intention.
(May it it be Your will
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that no person be envious of me
and that I not be envious of others,
that I not be brought to anger this day,
and that I not cause Your anger;
and save me from the evil inclination,
and help me be humble and any modest.
Our King and our Father,
unify Your Name in Your world,
rebuild Your city, establish Your house
and perfect your sanctuary.
Gather our exiles,
redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name.
Act for the sake of Your right hand.
Act for the sake of Your Torah.
Act for the sake of Your holiness.
In order that Your loved ones be released,
deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He make peace
upon us and upon all Israel

May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days,
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.
And let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Tachanun

<small>On Rosh Chodesh, Chol HaMoed, and Chanukah, Hallel is recited. On Fast Days (Monday—Thursday—Monday, Tenth of Teves, Fast of Esther, Seventeenth of Tamuz) <i>Selichos</i> are recited. On days when <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted (see below) the chazzan continues with Half Kaddish. (14 and 15 Adar Rishon in a leap year); the entire month of Nissan; Pesach Sheini (14 Iyar); Lag BaOmer; 1-8 Sivan; 9 and 15 Av; and 29 Elul. When <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted on these days, it is also omitted at the preceding Mincha (afternoon service).</small>
<small><i>Tachanun</i> is also omitted in the presence of a bridegroom, in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, and on the occasion of a circumcision if the father, the <i>sandak</i> or the <i>mohel</i> is present. The worshipper recites the <i>Tachanun</i> in a sitting position, while resting his brow on his arm. During the morning service, when the hand-<i>tefillin</i> is on the left arm, he leans his brow on his right arm, but at the Mincha service he leans his brow on his left arm. This "falling on one's face" symbolizes complete submission to God and the committing of our destinies into His hands. It is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Maseches Megillah</i> 22b), and originates with Moses, who "Fell down before God" (Deuteronomy 9:18) and was followed by Joshua, who "Fell on the earth upon his face before the Ark of God" (Joshua 7:6)</small>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
We are righteous and have not sined.
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered.
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other's possessions even though we paid for them;
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; we have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God's Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.
You are Almighty, Slow to anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance,
You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made know
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah:
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
When Adonoy descended in the cloud.
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
And He stood with him there.
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
And He proclaimed in the Name, Adonoy
And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
and Acquitter of those who repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:5-7.</i>
And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:9.</i>
Pardon us,our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 86:5.</i>
<small>The following supplication is recited while resting your brow on your arm.</small>
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14),
I am greatly distressed;
let us fall into the hand of Adonoy<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">David had sinned by counting the Jews. And his heart was crushed with remorse when the prophet Gad, at God's command, offered him a choice of three punishments: seven years of famine, or three months of defeat in war, or three days of pestilence. David chose the last of these three, explaining that he preferred to trust in God's compassion rather than be at man's mercy. Indeed, the pestilence lasted only half a day instead of three.</i>
for His mercies are great,
but into the hand of man let me not fall."
Merciful and gracious One,
I have sinned before You;
Adonoy, full of mercy,
have compassion upon me
and accept my supplications.
Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In this psalm (6:2-11) David willingly accepts Divine punishment. He asks only that it not be inflicted on him at once in a sudden, unbearable burst of fury. Rather, he pleads, that it be meted out gradually so that he can withstand the suffering.—<i>Radak</i></i>
nor chastise me with Your rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rebuke is offered with kind words, while chastisement, is often accompanied by harsh punishment.—<i>Malbim</i></i>
Be gracious unto me, Adonoy,
for I am desolate,
heal me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified.
My soul, [too,] is utterly terrified,
and You Adonoy, how long?
Return Adonoy, free my soul,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Since all physical illness stems from blemishes and sins of the soul, the Talmud (<i>Maseches Nedarim</i> 41a) states that a person does not recover from his illness until all of his sins are forgiven, as it says, “Who forgives all your sins. Who heals all your ailments” (Psalms 103:3). David first requests that God free his soul by forgiving his sins; only then can his shattered body be healed.—<i>Imros Tehoros</i></i>
deliver me
for the sake of Your lovingkindness.
For in death there is no mention of You;
in the lower world who will thank You.
I am worn out with my sighing,
every night I cause my bed to float;
with my tears, I melt my couch.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">During the twenty-two years the Holy Spirit departed from him, David shed a cupful of tears and drank it every single day.—<i>Yalkut</i> (<i>Samuel </i>165)</i>
My eye is dimmed from anger,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">David was angry because his enemies rejoiced over his illness.—<i>Radak</i></i>
it has aged because of my tormentors.
Depart from me, all you evildoers,
for Adonoy has heard
the voice of my weeping.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Weeping is the eloquence of sorrow, and our tears are liquid prayers.</i>
Adonoy has heard my supplication,
Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Prayer seeks spiritual purification and proper understanding.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i>
Ashamed and utterly terrified<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">My enemies, who hoped for my death, will be ashamed and terrified when they see that my health has been restored.—<i>Radak</i></i>
will all my foes be,
they will return
and be instantaneously ashamed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When they witness my recovery, they will regret their animosity and seek peace with me. At that moment they will be ashamed to face me.—<i>Radak</i></i>

Avinu Malkeinu

<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> is recited here during <i>Shacharis</i>—the morning service, and <i>Mincha</i>—the afternoon service. It is also said by some congregations on public Fast Days. The number of petitions in this prayer varies with custom, but in our rite, <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> consists of 44 petitions. Since many of them are similar to the petitions of <i>Shemoneh Esrei, Avinu Malkeinu</i> is never recited on Shabbos, when the petitions of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> are also omitted.</small>
<small>This unique and moving prayer is recorded as having been recited by Rabbi Akiva. The Talmud (<i>Maseches Taanis</i> 25b) relates that Rabbi Eliezer once stepped down before the Ark and recited the 24 benedictions for fast days and his prayers were not answered. Rabbi Akiva stepped down after him and exclaimed, "Our Father, our King, we have no king except You. Our Father, our King, for Your sake have mercy on us," and rain fell.</small>
Our Father, our King!<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as God's slaves (Leviticus 25:42), and as His children (Deuteronomy 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King Contrary to the view that God, the Father, is so full of love for His children, that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that God the King, must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to God—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!</i>
we have sinned before You.
Our Father our King!
we have no King except You.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Despite our physical banishment and spiritual estrangement—the result of our sins—we still have none other than God to guide our lives and to shape our destiny.</i>
Our Father, our King!
deal with us [kindly]
for the sake of Your Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 36.</i>
<small><i>During the Ten Days of Penitence, say:</i></small>
Our Father, our King!

Our Father, our King!

forgive and pardon all our iniquities.
Our Father, Our King!
blot out and remove our transgressions
and sins from before Your eyes.
Our Father, Our King!
erase in Your abundant mercy
all records of our liabilities.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Having just asked that our sins be forgiven and that our transgressions be removed from before His eyes, what are we asking for now? Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is, having watched while others sin, when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say כל ישראל ערבין זה לזה. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask God to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor. In all instances, He is the Extender of credit.) Thus we beseech God to erase the records of our guilt in those instances.—<i>Siach Yitzchok</i></i>
Our Father, Our King!
bring us back

Vehu Rachum

<small><i>The following prayers are added on Mondays and Thursday. On other days, continue "Guardian of Israel. . .":</i></small>
<small>This group of somber plaints, known as the "long <i>Vehu Rachum</i>" is recited in the morning service on Mondays and Thursdays, except on days when <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted.</small>
<small>The origin of these seven prayers is shrouded in legend. It has been suggested that they were composed during the terrible persecutions at the hands of the Goths in seventh-century Spain. It has been said, "Whoever can read this ‘long <i>Vehu Rachum</i>' prayer without emotion has lost all feeling for what is great and noble."</small>
<small>Despite all the repetition in these cries for forgiveness, mercy, help, and protection, the effect is not tiring; because here it is not merely an individual soul, but the soul of an entire people that utters these laments and supplications, that gives voice to this woe of nearly two thousand years.</small>
<small>Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the Second Tablets on the fifth day of the week, and he returned to the people on the second day of the week, bringing them the new tablets as a security for the Divine covenant and as confirmation of God's atonement for their transgression. Ever since, the second and fifth day of each week, Monday and Thursday, have been days of summons to the Jewish people to assemble anew before God and to reaffirm their sincere "return" to the Law of God. Our regular service is therefore augmented on these days by these additional supplications.</small>
And He, the merciful One,
will atone iniquity, and will not destroy,
He frequently withdraws His anger,
and does not arouse all His rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 78:38.</i>

If You, God, should preserve iniquities,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Were it not for the grace of God, any sin a person committed would deprive him of the right to continued existence. (Transgression is seen as a form of treason which is punishable by death). However, through the grace of Divine forgiveness, God makes it possible for us to atone for past sins through penitence and the decision to act in the future with God-fearing conduct.—<i>S.R.

We, too, are sustained by our trust that God will eventually lead us to salvation as He led Jacob to a pinnacle of joy and happiness.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i>

let wrath not prevail over us,
for, Adonoy, deliverance is Yours.
Our hope rests with You, God of forgiveness;
please forgive [us],
for You Almighty, are good, and forgiving.
We beseech You,
gracious and compassionate King,
remember and look
to the Covenant between the divided pieces,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 15:9-21 for a complete account of this covenant with Abraham.</i>

Do not abandon<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">To abandon means to leave a person to his own devices. “You know, our Father, that our own strength and intelligence are not adequate for us, so give us Your Fatherly care.”—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> us our father,

for the nations have said, "Their hope is lost."
Let every knee bend to You

our soul is terrified from our great sorrow—
forget us not forever;
arise and deliver us.
Do not pour out Your wrath upon us,
for we are Your people,

Almighty, look!
Our glory has sunk low among the nations,
and they abominate us
like the impurity of the <i>nidah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nidah</i> is menstrual uncleanliness. See Leviticus 12:2.</i>

for the sake of Your Name,
let our sufferings not seem trivial to You.
May Your mercy come swiftly toward us
in time of our distress;
not for our sake,
but do it for Your sake,
and do not obliterate

Reading of the Torah

<small>(Weekdays)</small>
<small>The following paragraph is said on Mondays and Thursdays except on Rosh Chodesh, the eve of Pesach, Tishah b'Av, Chanukah, the 14th and 15th Adar and Adar Sheni (Purim and Purim Katan), the eve of Yom Kippur, and it is also omitted in the house of a mourner.</small>
<small>This prayer is recited while standing, as it includes a form of viduy (<i>confession</i>) which must be said while standing.</small>
<small>On Mondays and Thursdays, as we are about to open the Ark to take out the Seifer Torah for public reading, we realize that we have transgressed much that is written in the Torah and are unworthy even to take it into our hands. Aware of our inadequacy and unworthiness, we utter the words, "Almighty who is slow to anger etc....", appealing to Him for forgiveness.</small>
Almighty who is slow to anger
and full of compassion,
do not hide Your presence from us.
Adonoy, spare Your people<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse from Joel (2:17) was inserted here by the sages of Italy as an abbreviated form of <i>Tachanun</i> to be recited by latecomers to the synagogue, instead of the entire “<i>Vehu Rachum</i>”, so that they could pay attention to the reading of the Torah.</i>
and save us from all evil.
We have sinned against You, Master,
forgive us, please,
in keeping with Your abundant mercy,
Almighty.
<small>Moses and the Elders with him ordained that the Torah be read in public on Shabbos, Monday and Thursday mornings. The Talmud (<i>Maseches Baba Kama</i> 82), notes that Ezra later instituted that three men should be called up to read a total of at least ten verses from the Torah. He also enacted that the Torah be read at the Shabbos Mincha (afternoon) service. When the Torah is removed from the Ark, great care is taken to honor it. It is escorted by as many people as possible from the moment it is taken out of the Ark until it is placed on the reading table. We embrace and kiss the Torah during the procession and refrain from idle chatter. While the Torah is being read, you must be silent and listen to each word.</small>
<small><i>When the Holy Ark is opened, the following is said:</i></small>
Whenever the Ark traveled,
Moses would say: "Rise, Adonoy
and let Your enemies be scattered,
and those who hate You, flee before You."
For from Zion will go forth the Torah,
and the word of Adonoy from Jerusalem.
Blessed is He Who gave the Torah
to His people Israel in His holiness.
<small>The following prayer is taken from the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshas Vayakhail</i>), the basic text of Kabbalah which was written by the Mishnaic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The <i>Zohar</i> states, "When the Torah is taken out to be read before the congregation, the heavenly gates of mercy are opened, and the Divine love is aroused; therefore one should say the following prayer.</small>
Blessed is the Name
of the Master of the universe.
Blessed is Your crown and Your place.
May Your good will [be]
with Your people Israel forever.
The redemption of Your right hand
show Your people in Your Holy Temple.
Bestow on us Your excellent light,
and accept our prayer with compassion.
May it be Your will
to prolong our lives in well-being.
Let me be counted
among the righteous,
so that You will have compassion on me
and protect me and all that is mine,
and all that belongs to Your people, Israel.
You are He
Who nourishes all and maintains all;
You are He Who rules over all;
You are He Who rules over kings,
and the kingdom is Yours.
I am a servant
of the Holy One, blessed is He,
I bow before Him
and before the honor of His Torah
at all times.
Not in man do I put my trust,
nor do I rely on any angel;
but only in the God of heaven,
Who is the true God,
Whose Torah is truth,
Whose prophets are true,
and Who performs many deeds
of goodness and truth.
In Him I put my trust
and to His holy, honored Name
I utter praises.
May it be Your will
to open my heart to Torah,
and to fulfill the desires of my heart,
and of the heart of Your people Israel,
for goodness, for life, and for peace.

<small>Psalm 20 is omitted on the following days: Rosh Chodesh, the day before Yom Kippur, Chanukah, both days of Purim, the day before Passover, the intermediate days of the Festivals (Chol HaMoed), and Tisha b'Av. It is also omitted when prayers are recited in the house of a mourner, the entire month of Nisssan, Pesach Sheni (14th of Iyar) Lag-b'omer, from Rosh Codesh Sivan through the twelfth of the month i.e., 5 days after Shavuoth, the Fifteenth of av, from Erev Yom Kippur until the end of Tishre, the Fifteenth of Shevat, when there is a circumcision in the Synagogue, or when a bride groom during the seven days of his wedding celebration is present.</small>
<small>According to Rabbi S.R. Hirsch, this psalm is addressed to David by the people of Israel. It is a testimonial of trust that the people have in the Divinely-appointed king, who is accustomed to victory and triumph. At the same time, it proclaims the eternal truth that the victories which our king wins for our people are to be attributed not to his bravery, nor to his sword, nor to his soldiers, but solely to his relationship with God, His Sanctuary, and His Law.</small>

upon the Name of Adonoy, our God, we call.
They have bowed down and fallen,

Adonoy, deliver [us],

<small>This portion, known as <i>Kedushas d'Sidra,</i> was introduced at the conclusion of the morning service to accomodate those who came to the synagogue too late to hear the <i>Kedushah</i> in <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> The Talmud (<i>Maseches Sotah</i> 49a) declares that the world is preserved solely by virtue of this <i>Kedushah,</i> and by the virtue of our answering, "May His great Name," which is part of the <i>Kaddish</i> recited following the study of the Aggadah. Because of its importance, a vernacular translation in Aramaic was added, so that even those ignorant of Hebrew would understand the sacred words.</small>
The Redeemer shall come to Zion
and to those of Jacob who repent from sin,
says Adonoy.
As for Me, this is My covenant with them,
said Adonoy:
My spirit which is upon you,
and My words
which I have put in your mouth
shall not depart from your mouth,
nor from the mouth of your children,
nor from the mouth
of your children's children,
said Adonoy—
from now to eternity.

And [the angels] call one to another and say:
Holy, holy, holy
is Adonoy of Hosts:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Targum interpretation, the thrice “holy” in the <i>Kedushah</i> does not indicate three ascending degrees of sanctification. Instead, it implies a declaration that He Who is holy in the loftiest regions of His heavenly abode is holy not only there but also on earth, the creation of His Almighty power; and that He was not only holy in the past, but that He is holy even now and will be holy throughout all the ages.—<i>S.R.

Psalm of the Day

<small>On days in which Tachanun is not said, "A prayer of David," is omitted, and we begin "House of Jacob". On days in which "Almighty who is slow to anger," is not said, continue with the Psalm for the appropriate day.</small>
A prayer of David.
Incline Your ear Adonay, and answer me,
for poor and needy am I.
Preserve my soul for I am devoted,
deliver Your servant, my God,
who trusts in You.
Be gracious to me my Master,
for to You I cry out all the day.
Make glad the soul of Your servant,
for, to You, my Master,
I lift up my soul.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.
Give ear, Adonoy, to my prayer,
and listen to the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my distress I call out to You,
for You will answer me.
There is none like You
among gods, my Master,
and there is nothing like Your works.
All nations which You have made
will come and bow down
before You, my Master,
and they will give honor to Your Name.
For You are great
and do wondrous things,
You alone God.
Teach me, Adonoy, Your way
that I may walk in Your truth;
let me be of one heart to fear Your Name.
I will thank You, my Master, my God,
with all my heart,
and I will glorify Your Name, forever.
For Your kindness
has been great toward me,
and You have rescued my soul
from the lowest depths of the grave.
God, the insolent have risen up against me,
and a company of violent men
have sought my soul,
and they have not set [the fear of] You
before them.
But You, my Master,
are the Almighty Who is Merciful
and Gracious,
Slow to Anger and Full of Kindness and Truth.
Turn to me and be gracious to me,
give Your strength to Your servant,
and deliver the son of Your handmaid.
Give me a sign of Your kindness,
that my enemies may see it and be ashamed,
for You, Adonoy, have helped me
and comforted me.
House of Jacob,
Come let us walk in the light of Adonoy.
For all the nations
walk in the name of its god,
but we walk in the Name of Adonoy,
our God, forever.
May Adonoy, our God, be with us
as He was with our fathers,
may He not forsake us nor abandon us,
that He may turn our hearts to Him,
to walk in all His ways,
to preserve His commandments, His statutes,
and His precepts,
which He commanded our fathers.
May these words of mine
[with] which I have prayed
before Adonoy,
be near to Adonoy, our God
by day and night;
that He provide the needs of his servant
and the needs of His people Israel
each day.
In order that it become known
to all the peoples of the earth
that Adonoy is God—
there is nothing else.
A Song of Ascents of David.
Had it not been for Adonoy
Who was for us,
let Israel now say.
Had it not been for Adonoy
Who was for us,
when men rose up against us.
They would have then swallowed us alive,
when their wrath blazed against us.
The waters would have then swept us away,
affliction would have passed over our soul.
Then over our soul would have gone
the impetuous waters.
Blessed is Adonoy,
Who did not give us
as prey to their teeth.
Our soul escaped as a bird
out of the fowler's snare;
the snare is broken
and we escaped.
Our help is in the Name of Adonoy,
Maker of heaven and earth.
<small>The custom of reciting a different psalm each day of the week originated in the Temple. The <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Maseches Tamid</i> 7:4) describes the psalms which were chanted by the Levites each day during the service.</small>
<small><i>On Sunday:</i></small>
Today is the first day of the week,

A psalm of David:

Today is the second day of the week,
on which the Levites used to recite
in the Holy Temple:
A song, a psalm by the sons of Korach.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">On the second day, psalm 48, “Adonoy is great and highly extolled,” was sung by the Levites because on the second day of creation God separated the heavenly and earthly parts of the universe and ruled over both.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 31a</i>
Adonoy is great and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.
Beautiful in its panoramic vista,
the joy of all the earth is Mount Zion,
on the northern extremities (of Jerusalem);<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem is the source of all the joy in the world. Joy radiates from Jerusalem to the rest of the world because it is the center of the universe, both in terms of geography and history. The Temple era is the midpoint of the generations—of the generations which preceded the Temple, and of those which followed its destruction. The generations before the Temple were uplifted and imbued with the hopes of its realization; the later generations are drawn to its light by recalling its radiant glory and by anticipating its rebuilding. We mention Jerusalem at every joyous occasion to emphasize that it is the true source of joy.—<i>Sfas Emes</i><br><i>Tziyun</i> is the Hebrew word for a monument, a memorial for someone who has died. When it is spelled “<i>Tziyon,</i> it refers to the site of God's Sanctuary, a timeless memorial for the preservation of truth in the midst of mankind. Even though the Temple has been destroyed, the mountain symbolically reminds man of the presence of the true God.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i>
the city of the great King.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentators say that the great king refers to David, rather than to God.</i>

A psalm of Assaf<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Assaf was one of the ten composers who contributed to the <i>Book of Psalms;</i> he wrote eleven psalms (73-83). The leading Levite musician of his times, he was also endowed with the spirit of prophecy.</i>
God stands

in the midst of the judges He gives judgement.
How long will you judge lawlessly

Render justice to the lowly and the orphan,

Rescue the lowly and the needy,

<small>(Deliver us...; Mourner's Kaddish.)</small>
<small><i>On Wednesday:</i></small>
Today is the fourth day of the week,
on which the Levites used to recite
in the Holy Temple:
Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 94, “Almighty of vengeance” was sung on the fourth day because God created the sun and the moon on the fourth day, and He will punish those who worship them.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i></i>
Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.
Arise Judge of the earth,
repay the arrogant their just reward.
How long shall the wicked—
Adonoy—
how long shall the wicked exult?
They express, they speak with arrogance;
all the evildoers are boastful.
Adonoy, they crush Your people
and Your heritage they oppress.
The widow and stranger they kill,
and orphans they murder.
And they say, "God does not see,
the God of Jacob is not concerned."
Consider,
[you] stupid [ones] among the people,—
and you fools when will you become wise?
He Who implanted the ear, does He not hear?
He Who formed the eye, does He not see?
He Who chastises nations,
does He not reprove—
He that teaches man knowledge?
Adonoy knows the thoughts of men,
that they are vanity.
Fortunate is the man
whom You chastise, God,
and whom You instruct from Your Torah.
To grant him tranquility from days of evil,
until the pit is dug for the wicked.
for Adonoy will not abandon His people
and His inheritance, He will not forsake.
For justice shall return unto righteousness,
and all the upright in heart will follow it.
Who will rise up for me against the wicked,
who will stand up for me
against the evildoers?
Had Adonoy not been my help,
in an instant
my soul would have dwelt in the silent grave.
If [Whenever] I said, my foot has slipped,
Your kindliness, Adonoy upheld me.
When (worrisome) thoughts multiply
within me,
Your consolations soothe my soul.
Can a tribunal of evil have accord with You—
[a tribunal] that makes iniquity into law?
They gang up against the life of the righteous,
and blood of the innocent they condemn.
Adonoy has been my stronghold,
my God the Rock of my refuge.
He turns their violence against them,
and with their own wickedness
destroys them;
Adonoy, my God, destroys them.
Come let us sing to Adonoy;
let us shout for joy
to the Rock of our Deliverance.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This verse and the following two are from Psalms 95:1-3.</i>

Today is the fifth day of the week,
on which the Levites used to recite
in the Holy Temple:
To Him Who grants victory—<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 81 was designated for the fifth day “Because God created the birds and fish on that day.” These creatures bring joy to the world and when people observe the vast variety of the bird and fish species, they are awed by God's creativity.

upon the Gittis,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gittis was a musical instrument that was manufactured in the town of Gat.</i> a psalm of Assaf:
Sing joyously to God, our strength,
shout for joy to the God of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Meiri associates the word הריעו with תרועה, sounding the <i>shofar.</i> Thus the verse reads, “Sound the <i>shofar</i> to the God of Jacob.”</i>

Blow the <i>shofar</i> on the <i>Rosh Chodesh,</i>

For it is a statute for Israel,

I tested you at the waters of Merivah. <i>Selah.</i>
Hear, My people, I will testify about you,
Israel, if you would just listen to Me.
Let no strange god be within you,

But My people did not heed My voice,

So I sent them to follow their heart's desires,

If only My people would heed Me,

I would immediately subdue their enemies,

Those who cause hate of Adonoy

Adonoy has begun His reign,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">On the sixth day, the Levites sang Psalm 93, “Adonoy has begun his reign, with majesty He has clothed Himself,” because He completed the work of creation and reigned over all His creatures.—<i>Maseches Rosh Hashana</i> 31a</i>
with majesty He has clothed Himself;
Adonoy clothed Himself,
with strength He has girded Himself;
He has firmly established the world,
so that it cannot be moved.
Your throne stands firm from of old,
You are from eternity.
The rivers have raised—Adonoy—
the rivers have raised their voice,
the rivers raise their raging waves.
More than the roar of many waters,
mightier than the breakers of the sea,
mighty on high are You "Adonoy."
Your testimonies are extremely faithful;
holiness is becoming to Your House,
Adonoy,—for the length of days.
<small>(Deliver us...; Mourner's Kaddish.)</small>
Deliver us, God of our deliverance;
gather us and save us from the nations
to give thanks to Your holy Name,
to be extolled in Your praise.
Blessed is Adonoy, the God of Israel
for all eternity,
and all the people said: "Amen"
Praise God.
Blessed is Adonoy from Zion,
Who dwells in Jerusalem.
Praise God.
Blessed is Adonoy, God,
God of Israel
Who alone performs wonders.
And blessed is the Name of His glory forever,
and may His glory fill the whole earth.
Amen and Amen!

My Soul Bless

<small>The following psalm (104) is recited in many synagogues on Rosh Chodesh days, following the daily psalm.</small>
My soul, bless Adonoy;
Adonoy, my God, You are greatly exalted;
with beauty and splendor
are You clothed.
Enwrapped in light, garment-like,
He spreads out the heavens like a curtain.

wine to cheer the heart of man,

Psalm from Rosh Chodesh Elul

<small>The following psalm (27) is recited at the conclusion of services, morning and evenings, from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres. Others say only until Hoasha'na Rabbah.</small>
<small>The psalm voices our prayer that God will be our light on Rosh Hashana enabling us to repel the darkness of sin through true repentance, and that He will be our salvation on Yom Kippur, through His compassionate atonement of our sins.</small>
By David:
Adonoy is my light and my salvation,
whom shall I fear?
Adonoy is the strength<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rav S.R. Hirsch translates, “Adonoy is the source of my life's strength,” thus David declares that God is the fount from which his life derives its power to resist all foes.</i> of my life,
of whom shall I be afraid?
When evildoers approach me
to devour my flesh—
my tormentors and my foes
they stumble and fall.
If an army should encamp against me,
my heart would not fear;
if war were to rise against me,
in this<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">David says that he trusts in the declaration stated in the opening verse, “Adonoy is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?—<i>Rashi, Radak</i></i> I trust.
One thing I request of Adonoy,
[only] that shall I seek,
that I may dwell<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of שבתי is “my sitting.” The Talmud states that “no man may ‘sit’ in the courtyard of the Temple except for the kings of the House of David.”<i>—Maseches Sotah</i> 40b</i> in the House of Adonoy
all the days of my life,
to behold the pleasantness of Adonoy,
and to meditate in His Sanctuary.
For He will hide me in His Tabernacle<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Vilna Gaon comments that all the commandments pertaining to Succos are implied in this verse and the next.</i>
on the day of distress,
He will conceal me in the shelter of His Tent,
upon a rock He will lift me.
And now my head is raised high
above my enemies around me;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">David declares, “Because I look up to God in every aspect of my existence, I am so exalted that no enemy can harm me.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i>
and I will offer in His Tent,
sacrifices accompanied by trumpets of joy;
I will sing and chant to Adonoy.
Adonoy, hear my voice<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This verse alludes to Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. “Hear my voice,” refers to Rosh Hashana when we sound the shofar. The word “my voice (sound)” refers to the “voice” of the shofar. “When I call” refers to Yom Kippur, about which Isaiah (55:6) said, “call to Him when He is near.”—<i>Siddur HaGra</i></i> when I call;
be gracious to me and answer me.
Of You, my heart has said,
Seek My Presence;
Your Presence, Adonoy I will seek.
Conceal not Your Presence from me,
do not turn away Your servant in anger.
You have been my help;
neither cast me off nor abandon me,
God of my deliverance.
When my father and mother abandon<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Even if I were so depraved that my own mother and father would abandon me to my own devices, God would still gather me up and believe in my ability to mend my ways.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> me,
Adonoy will gather me up.
Adonoy, teach me Your way,
and lead me in the path of uprightness,
because of my watchers.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his enemies. David asks for Divine help that he be saved even from the mere semblance of wrongdoing so that his foes should not be able to rejoice over his faults.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i>
Do not deliver me
to the will of my tormentors,
for false witnesses have risen against me,
who breathe violence.
Had I not believed<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">“These false witnesses would have destroyed me had I not believed that I would see the goodness of God in the land of the living.”—<i>Rashi, Radak</i></i> that I would see
the goodness of Adonoy
in the land of living.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">There are various interpretations of the “Land of the living.” Some hold that it refers to the present world in which we live<i>—Metsudas Tzion; Ramban</i> holds that it refers to the World-to-Come; and Malbim says that it refers to Eretz Yisroel.</i>
Hope to Adonoy,
be strong and He will give you courage;
and hope to Adonoy.

Psalm in the House of a Mourner

<small><i>On days when Tachanun is said:</i></small>
<small>It is customary to recite this psalm (49) in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, following the morning and evening services. On weekdays when <i>Tachanun</i> is not said Psalm 16 (page 218) is substituted. This psalm, the final hymn of the psalms set down by the sons of Korach has significance for all mankind. Its message is that man must utilize all his material and physical resources to enhance his spiritual existence so that when his soul survives the body's brief stay on earth it can ascend to immortality. If man fails to recognize his purpose in life and instead regards the acquisition of material wealth the primary aim of life, he forfeits his hope of immortality, and his existence will not continue beyond the grave.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></small>
To Him Who grants victory,
a psalm by the sons of Korach.
Hear this all peoples,
listen all inhabitants of the decaying world!
Sons of Adam and sons of men,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate <i>b'nei adam,</i> “Men of low degree” or “Men without pedigree,” and <i>b'nei ish,</i> “Men of high degree” who can trace their ancestry to men of distinction.</i>
rich and poor together.
My mouth shall speak wisdom,
and the meditation of my heart
shall be of understanding.
I will incline my ear to a parable,
I will begin to solve,
to the accompaniment of a harp,
my riddle.
Why should I fear in the days of evil?
The iniquity I trod upon<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These are the sins which a person considers trivial and commits out of carelessness, just as one who walks is not concerned if he steps on something small or insignificant.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> surrounds me.
Those who trust in their wealth
and take pride in their great riches.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Those who trust in their wealth and glory in their great riches should be in fear.</i>
A man will not redeem his brother
neither can he give to God his ransom.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">S.R. Hirsch translates, “And thus does not give to God his ransom.” They fail to use their riches to free their fellow men from want and care, and so neglect to pay God the ransom due Him for their own souls. Radak says even if he wanted to ransom his soul from God, he could not, for God does not accept bribes.</i>
The redemption of their soul is too costly
and it shall cease<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Because they neglected their duty, their soul shall cease to be. They have done nothing to insure the perpetuation of their souls.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> to be forever.
Shall he then live forever,
shall he never see the grave?
For he sees that wise men die,
the fools and senseless perish equally<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When the wise die, only their bodies pass away; but their souls live on. The foolish and senseless sinners perish completely, leaving no trace of body or soul.—<i>Rashi, Radak</i></i>
and leave their wealth to others.
Their inner<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Some translate the word <i>kirbom</i> as “their graves,” by transposing the letters to <i>kivrom. </i>Because they have no merits, the wicked will not arise at the time of resurrection and therefore, “Their graves are their houses forever” (<i>Ibn Ezra</i>).</i> thoughts are
that their houses [will last] forever,
their homes for generation after generation;
(for) they have proclaimed<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They spread their names far and wide by erecting monuments and edifices and naming them after themselves. In this manner, they seek to fulfill their yearning for immortality.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> their names
throughout the lands.
But man does not endure in his splendor,
he is likened to the silenced animals.
This is their way—
their folly remains with them,
and [yet] their descendants
take pleasure in their speech, <i>Selah.</i>
Like sheep—they are destined for the grave;
death shall be their shepherd,
and the upright shall dominate them
at morning,
their form will be consumed in the grave;
[it will not remain] their dwelling-place.
But God will redeem my soul
from the [grasp of] the grave,
for He will take me [to Himself] <i>Selah.</i>
Fear not when a man grows rich,
when the glory of his house is increased.
For when he dies, he shall carry nothing away,
his glory will not descend after him.
Because while he lived, he blessed his soul.
(saying): they will praise you
because you have done well for yourself.
He will join the generation of his fathers,
they shall not see light, for all eternity.
Man with [all] his splendor,
[but] without understanding<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Man created in the image of God possesses glorious potential, and his soul is filled with Divine splendor, but when he fails to appreciate and utilize his potential, he is likened to the dead animals.—<i>Radak</i></i>
is likened to the silenced animals.
<small>(Mourner's Kaddish.)</small>
<small>On weekdays when <i>Tachanun</i> is not said, the following is said in the house of a mourner.</small>
A <i>Michtam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi, a <i>michtam</i> was a very special musical arrangement composed for this psalm.</i> of David.
Preserve me, Almighty,
for I have taken refuge in You.
You said to Adonoy,
You are my Master,
I have no well-being without You.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">You are not obliged to reward me for obeying Your command since You are my Master. And as Your servant, I must heed Your every wish.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
Due to the holy that are in the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Any good You do on my behalf is only through the merit of those holy and pious men of the past who are now buried in the earth.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
and the mighty,
are all my desires [fulfilled].
Let their sufferings multiply,
those who follow another [sovereignty];
I will not pour their libations of blood,
nor carry their names
upon my lips.
Adonoy is the portion of my inheritance
and of my cup;
You guide my fate.
The portions that have fallen to me
are in pleasant places;
a beautiful inheritance is mine.
I will bless Adonoy
Who has given me counsel;
even for the nights
in which my mind admonished me.
I have set Adonoy before me always;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Hana Ben Bizra said in the name of Rabbi Shimon the Pious, “He who prays should regard himself as though the Shechina, the Divine Presence, were before him, as it is written, ‘I have set Adonoy before me always’.”<i>—Maseches Sanhedrin</i> 22a</i>
for surely He is at my right hand,
I will not be moved.
Therefore my heart rejoiced
and my soul exulted;
also my flesh will dwell in safety.
For You will not abandon my soul
to the grave,
nor will You allow Your devoted one
to see the pit.
You will make known to me
the path of life;
fullness of joy is in Your presence;
pleasantness is at Your right hand, evermore.

Aleinu

Hope to Adonoy;
be strong and He will give you courage
and hope to Adonoy.
There is none holy like Adonoy
for there is none beside You
and thee is no stronghold like our God.
For who is a god other than Adonoy
and who is a stronghold beside our God.
There is none like our God.
There is none like our Master.
There is none like our King.
There is none like our Deliverer.
Who is like our God?
Who is like our Master?
Who is like our King?
Who is like our Deliverer?
Let us thank our God.
Let us thank our Master.
Let us thank our King.
Let us thank our deliverer.
Blessed is our God.
Blesed is our Master.
Blessed is our King.
Blessed is our Deliverer.
You are our God.
You are our Master.
You are our King.
You are our Deliverer.
You will deliver us
You will arise and have mercy on Zion,
for it is time to be gracious to her,
for the appointed time has come
you are He,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers
before whom our fathers burned
the incenese offering.
The composition of the incense consisted of
balm, onycha,
galbanum, and frankincense—
by weight, seventy maneh of each;
myrrh, cassia,
spikenard and saffron
by weight—
sixteen maneh of each;
twelve maneh of costus,
three maneh of aromatic bark,
and nine maneh of cinnamon.
[Also used in compounding the incense were:] Nine kabin of Carshina lye,
Cyprus wine [measuring]
three s'in and three kabin—
if he had no Cyprus wine,
he could used strong white wine—
a fourth of a kab of Sodom salt,
and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan.
Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says,
Add a minute quantity of Jordan amber.
If one added honey, the incense became unfit;
and if one omitted any of its spices
he was liable to the death penalty.
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says:
The balm is nothing but sap
which drips from the balsam tree.
Why was Carshina lye used?
To refine the onycha
in order to make it pleasant.
Why was Cyprus wine used?
The onycha was soaked in it
to give it a pungent odor.
Though the water of Raglayim
was well suited for that purpose,
they did not bring
the water of Raglayim into the Temple
because it would be disrespectful.
It was taught in the school of Elijah;
Whoever studies halachos every day,
he is assured
of life in the World-to-Come,
for it is said,
The ways (halichos) of the world are His."
Do not read halichos, but halachos:
Rabbi Eliezer said
on behalf of Rabbi Chanina:
the disciples of the wise
increase peace in the world,
for it is said:
‘and all your children
will be disciples of Adonoy's [Torah];
and great will be the peace of your children.'
Do not read banayich [your children]
but read bonayich [your builders].
Great is the peace
of those who love Your Torah,
and they will have no
stumbling block [misfortune].
Let there be peace within your moats,
serenity within your palaces.
For the sake of my brethren and companions,
I will say: ‘peace be with you.'
For the sake
of the House of Adonoy, our God,
I will seek [pray for] your good.
<small>Mourners say the following Kaddish d'Rabanan</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach.
In your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—

May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.

and upon all those who engage in Torah study
in this land
and in every land.
May there be unto them and unto you

<small><i>Kol Bo</i> writes that Joshua authored this prayer when he captured Jericho. Taken from the Musaf service of Rosh Hashana, it serves as the closing prayer of all the daily services. As ruled by <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 133), it is said while standing.</small>
It is our obligation to praise
the Master of all,
to ascribe greatness
to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning:
that He has not made us
like the nations of the lands,
and has not positioned us
like the families of the earth;
that He has not assigned
our portion like theirs,
nor our lot like that of all their multitudes.
For they prostrate themselves
to vanity and nothingness,
and pray to a god that cannot deliver.
But we bow, prostrate ourselves,
and offer thanks
before the Supreme King of Kings,
the Holy One blessed is He,
Who spreads the heavens,
and establishes the earth,
and the seat of His glory is in heaven above,
and the abode of His invincible might
is in the loftiest heights.
He is our God, there is nothing else.
Our King is true,
all else is insignificant,
as it is written in His Torah:
And You shall know this day
and take into Your heart
that Adonoy is God
in the heavens above
and upon the earth below;
there is nothing else.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:39.</i>
We therefore put our hope in You,
Adonoy our God,
to soon behold the glory of Your might
in banishing idolatry from the earth,
and the false gods will be utterly exterminated
to perfect the world
as the kingdom of Shadai.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See page 00, note 00.</i>
And all mankind will invoke Your Name,
to turn back to You,
all the wicked of the earth.
They will realize and know,
all the inhabitants of the world,
that to You, every knee must bend,
every tongue must swear [allegiance to You].
Before You, Adonoy, our God,
they will bow and prostrate themselves,
and to the glory of Your Name give honor.
And they will all accept [upon themselves]
the yoke of Your kingdom,
and You will reign over them, soon,
forever and ever.
For the kingdom is Yours,
and to all eternity You will reign in glory,
as it is written in Your Torah:
Adonoy will reign forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 15:18.</i>
And it is said:
And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zecharyah 14:9.</i>
Do not fear sudden terror
nor the destruction of the wicked
when it comes
take counsel together but it will be foiled
speak the word and it will not stand
for God is with us.
To Your old age I am [with You],
to Your older years I will sustain You,
I have made You, and I will carry You,
I will sustain You and save You.

Mourner's Kaddish

<small>Although the Kaddish contains no reference to the dead, it has been recited by mourners for many centuries. The tradition of the mourner's Kaddish began with the following incident: Once, while walking, Rabbi Akiva met a man who had died some time before and was suffering the torments of Purgatory. He pleaded with Rabbi Akiva to go to his home town and teach his son to recite the Kaddish and Borechu, for this would save him from the terrible punishments. Rabbi Akiva and his Court then instituted the practice of mourners reciting the Kaddish, for until then it had been limited to the Chazzan's reciting it only after the services or after a sermon (See <i>Tana D'vei Eliyahu Zuta,</i> 17: <i>Zohar Parshas Noach</i>).</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming if His Messiah
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace
(<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace)
in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
and say, Amen.

Six Verses of Remembrance

<small>According to some authorities it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to recite these six verses of remembrance every day. Those who do so are assured of a share in the World-to-Come.</small>
<b><i>The Exodus</i></b>
...in order that you remember the day
you came out of the land of Egypt
all the days of your life.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:3.</i>
<b><i>The Revelation at Mount Sinai</i></b>
Only beware,
and guard you soul diligently,
lest you forget the things
which your eyes have seen;
lest they be removed from your heart
all the days of your life;
and make them known to your children
and to your children's children.
[That what you witnessed] the day you stood
before Adonoy your God at Chorev.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:9-10.</i>
<b><i>The Attack of Amalek</i></b>
Remember
what Amalek did to you

Thirteen Principles of Faith

<small>Many great medieval scholars formulated articles of faith, among them Rav Saadya Gaon, Rav Yehuda Halevi, Rabbeinu Bachya. Maimonides, the foremost of them all, formulated thirteen principles that have attained wide recognition and enduring fame.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In a fascinating work, <i>Rosh Amana,</i> Don Isaac Abarbanel enumerates all the attacks on each and all of Maimonides’ principles, adding his own incisive questions to those of his predecessors, and then proceeds to vindicate Maimonides’ principles, and their precise formulation.</i> </small>
<small>The thirteen principles fall into three groups: The first five declare the existence of God as the Creator, One, incorporeal, eternal and alone worthy of man's worship.</small>
<small>The next four deal with the Divine revelation of the Torah, the authenticity of prophecy, particularly that of Moses, and the immutability of the Torah.</small>
<small>The last four deal with God in history, reward and punishment, belief in the coming of Messiah, and the resurrection of the dead.</small>
1. I believe with complete faith
that the Creator, blessed is His Name,
is the Creator and Guide
of all created things,
and He alone has made, does make,
and will make all things.
2. I believe with complete faith
that the Creator, blessed is His Name,
is unique,
and there is no uniqueness like His
in any manner;
and that He alone is our God,
Who was, is, and will ever be.
3. I believe with complete faith
that the Creator, blessed is His Name,
is not corporeal,
and that He is beyond all corporeal concepts,
and there is nothing at all comparable to Him.
4. I believe with complete faith
that the Creator, blessed is His Name,
is First and Last.
5. I believe with complete faith
that the Creator, blessed is His Name,
is the only One to Whom it is proper to pray,
and to no being beside Him
is it proper to pray.
6. I believe with complete faith
that all the words of the prophets are true.
7. I believe with complete faith
that the prophecy of our teacher, Moses,
may he rest in peace,
was true,
and that he was the father of all prophets,
—of those who preceded him,
and of those who followed him.
8. I believe with complete faith
that the entire Torah
which is now in our possession,
is the very one that was given
to our teacher Moses, may he rest in peace.
9. I believe with complete faith
that this Torah will not be exchanged,
and that no additional Torah
[will be given] by the Creator,
blessed is His Name.
10. I believe with complete faith
that the Creator, blessed is His Name,
knows all the deeds of men
and all their thoughts,
as it is said,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:15.</i>
He Who forms all their hearts as one,
Who comprehends all their deeds.
11. I believe with complete faith
that the Creator, blessed is His Name,
rewards those who keep His commandments,
and punishes those
who transgress His commandments.
12. I believe with complete faith
in the coming of the Messiah
and even though he may tarry,
nevertheless,
I yearn every day for his coming.
13. I believe with complete faith
that there will be a resurrection of the dead
at a time that pleases
the Creator, blessed is His Name,
and His Name will be exalted forever
and to all eternity.

The Chapter of Reverence for God

<small>Deuteronomy 10:12-11:9</small>
And now Israel, what does Adonoy, your God, require of you, but to fear Adonoy, your God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him and to serve Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul. To keep the commandments of Adonoy and His decrees, which I command you this day. Behold, the heaven and the highest of heavens belong to Adonoy, your God, the earth and all that is in it. Yet only in your fathers did Adonoy delight, to love them, and He chose their offspring after them, even you among all the peoples as [it is] this day. Circumcise the barrier of your heart, and be stiffnecked no longer. For Adonoy, your God, is God of all powers and the Master of all masters, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, Who has no regard for personages and takes no bribes. Who does justice for the orphan and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. You must love the stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. You must fear Adonoy, your God, serve Him, cleave to Him, and swear by His Name. He is your praise, and He is your God, Who did with you all these great and awesome things that your eyes have seen. With seventy people your fathers descended to Egypt, and now Adonoy, your God, has made you as abundant as the stars of heaven. [Therefore] you shall love Adonoy, your God, and keep His trust, His decrees, His statutes, and His commandments all the days. And you should know this day, that it is not with your children who have not known and who did not experience the chastisement of Adonoy, your God, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm. His signs and His deeds that He performed in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land. And what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how He made the water of the Sea of Reeds drown them as they pursued you, and Adonoy destroyed them to this very day. And what He did for you in the wilderness, until you came into this place. And what He did unto Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them, and their households, their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel. But your eyes have seen all the great deeds of Adonoy, that He performed. You should [therefore] keep all the commandments which I command you this day, so you will be strong, and go in and possess the land, to which you are passing over to possess it. And in order to prolong your days upon the land Adonoy swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring; a land flowing with milk and honey.
<small>The following prayer is omitted on Shabbos and Yom Tov</small>
May it be Your will Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, to implant Your love and fear of You in my heart and in the heart of all Israel, Your people, to fear Your Great, Mighty and Awesome Name with all our heart and with all our soul, for You are great and Your Name is awesome. Amein. <i>Selah.</i>

The Chapter of Repentance

<small>Deuteronomy 30:1-11</small>
And it will come to pass when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, that you will take it to heart in the midst of all the nations to which Adonoy, your God, has driven you. Then you will return unto Adonoy, your God, and obey His voice according to everything that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul. And then Adonoy, your God, will return your captivity and have compassion upon you; and He will return and gather you from among all the peoples where Adonoy, your God, has scattered you. Even if your scattered ones will be dispersed unto the outermost parts of heaven, from there Adonoy, your God, will gather you, and from there, He will take you. And Adonoy, your God, will bring you into the land which your forefathers possessed, and you will possess it; and He will do good to you and increase you even more than your fathers. Adonoy, your God, will circumcise your heart, and the hearts of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. Then Adonoy, your God, will set all these curses upon your enemies, and upon those who hate you, who have pursued you. But you will repent and listen to the voice of Adonoy, and perform all His commandments that I command you this day. And Adonoy, your God, will cause you to prosper in all your activities, in the fruit of your womb, in the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your soil, for good; for Adonoy will rejoice over you for goodness as He rejoiced over your fathers. For you will then obey the voice of Adonoy, your God, to observe His commandments and His decrees that are written in this Seifer Torah; for you will then return to Adonoy, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul.
<small>(The following prayer is not recited on Shabbos and Yom Tov.)</small>
May it be Your will Adonoy, my God, and the God of my fathers, to construct a passage beneath Your Throne of Glory in order to bring back in perfect repentance all the transgressors of Your people, the House of Israel. And among them, bring me back unto You in perfect repentance, for Your right hand is outstretched to receive those who repent, for You desire repentance. Amein. <i>Selah.</i>

The Chapter of Mannah

<small>According to the Jerusalem Talmud, one who recites this Torah chapter every day is assured that he will never lack for food. The prayer preceding the Torah chapter should not be recited on Shabbos or Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers, to grant livelihood for all Your people, the House of Israel, and may my livelihood and the livelihood of my household be included among them. May it be granted to us with tranquility and not with suffering, with honor and not with disgrace, legally and not illegally, so that we will be able to serve You and study Your Torah. Grant it to us now as You sustained our ancestors in the wilderness, in a desolate and arid land.
<small>Exodus 16:4-36</small>
And Adonoy said to Moses, "See, I will make bread rain down from heaven for you; and the people will go out and gather it for each day['s needs], so that I may test them to see if they will live according to My Torah or not. On the sixth day, they shall prepare what they bring [home], and it will be twice as much as they gather every day." Then Moses and Aaron said to all the Children of Israel, "When evening comes you will know that it was Adonoy Who brought you out of Egypt. And in the morning you will see the glory of Adonoy, since He has heard your complaints against Adonoy. But we—what are we that you should complain against us?"
And Moses said, "When Adonoy gives us meat to eat in the evening and a satisfying meal of bread in the morning, Adonoy will have heard your complaints, which you are addressing to Him. What are we? Your complaints are not against us, but against Adonoy." Then Moses said to Aaron, "Tell the entire community of the Children of Israel, ‘Come near before Adonoy, for He has heard your complaints.'" When Adonoy spoke to the entire community of the Children of Israel, they turned toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Adonoy appeared in the cloud.
Adonoy spoke to Moses saying, "I have heard the complaints of the Children of Israel; speak to them, saying, ‘In the afternoon you will eat meat, and in the morning you will have your fill of bread; and you will know that I am Adonoy, your God.'" And it was in the evening that flocks of quail rose and covered the encampment; and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the encampment.
The layer of dew evaporated, and behold on the surface of the wilderness were thin flakes, as fine as frost on the ground. The Children of Israel saw it and said to one another, "What is this?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "This is the bread that Adonoy is giving you to eat." "This is what Adonoy has commanded: Every man shall take as much as he needs for food, an <i>omer</i> per person; according to the number of your souls let each man take for the individuals in his tent." The Children of Israel did so; they gathered it, some more, some less. But when then they measured it with an <i>omer,</i> the one who took more did not have extra, and the one who took less was not lacking. Each one had gathered according to his required nourishment. Moses said to them, "Let jo one leave any of it over until morning." But some did not listen to Moses and left part of it over until the morning. It turned wormy and became putrid; and Moses was angry at them; they gathered it each morning, every man according to what he needed. The sun then became hot and it melted.
On the sixth day [of the week] they gathered a double portion of food, two <i>omers</i> for each person. All the leaders of the community came and reported it to Moses. He said to them, "This is what Adonoy has [already] spoken: tomorrow is a day of rest, Adonoy's holy Shabbos. Bake what you want to bake, and cook what you want to cook and whatever is left over, put away carefully until morning. They put it away until morning as Moses commanded, and it did not become putrid, and there were no worms in it. Then Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is Adonoy's Shabbos. Today you will not find [manna] in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but the seventh day is Shabbos; there will be no [manna] on that day." But it happened on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather [manna] but they found nothing.
Adonoy said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and My teachings? Look, Adonoy has given you the Shabbos; that is why on the sixth day He gave you food for two days. Every man must remain in his place; no man may leave his designated place on the seventh day." So the people rested on the seventh day. The House of Israel named the food <i>manna.</i> It was like white coriander seed and it tasted like dough kneaded with honey. Moses said, "This is what Adonoy has commanded, ‘Fill an <i>omer</i> measure with it as a keepsake for your generations, so they will see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness when I took you out of Egypt." Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and place an <i>omer</i> full of manna in it, and place it before Adonoy as a keepsake for your generations." As Adonoy commanded Moses, so did Aaron place it before the Testimony as a keepsake. The Children of Israel ate the manna for forty years until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan. The <i>omer</i> is one-tenth of a <i>ephah.</i>

Birkas Hamazon

<b>Psalm 137</b>
<small><i>Psalm 137 is recited before </i>Birkas Hamazon<i> on weekdays in memory of the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash:</i></small>
By the rivers of Babylon,
there we sat and we also wept,
when we remembered Zion.
Upon the willows in its midst,
we hung our harps.
For there our captors demanded of us
words of song,
and our tormentors asked of us [with] mirth;
Sing to us from the song[s] of Zion.
How shall we sing the song of Adonoy
on alien soil?
If I ever forget you, Jerusalem,
may my right hand forget [its movement].
May my tongue cleave to my palate,
if I remember you not;
if I set not Jerusalem
above my highest joy.
Remember, Adonoy,
to the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem,
[it was they] who said,
Raze it, raze it to its very foundation.
Daughter of Babylon,
you are the annihilated one;
fortunate is he who will repay you
for all you have done to us.
Fortunate is he who will take
and dash your little ones against the rock.
<b>Psalm 126</b>
<small>Psalm 126 is recited on Shabbos, Yom Tov and other festive occasions such as weddings, circumcisions or redemption of the first born.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
When Adonoy brings about
the return to Zion
we will have been like dreamers.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Upon the redemption and return to Zion, the harshness of the exile will seem to the Jews like a terrible dream.—<i>Radak</i><br>The splendor of the return to Zion will be like the realization of an impossible dream.—<i>Seporno</i></i>
Then will our mouths be filled with laughter,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmud (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 31a) Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai rules that a Jew is forbidden to fill his mouth with laughter in this world until the time comes when all nations declare: “Adonoy has done great things for them”—as the verse states: אז ימלא שחוק פינו, <i>then</i>: only then, when God’s love for us is universally recognized, may we experience total exultation.</i>
and our tongue with joyous song.
Then will they say among the nations:
‘Adonoy has done great things for them.'
Adonoy had done great things for us;
we will [then] rejoice.
Adonoy! bring back our exiles
like springs in the desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Just as springs of water can transform an arid desert into a fertile oasis, so will we be transformed, and flourish when God delivers us from exile.—<i>Rashi</i></i>
Those who sow in tears

[Though] he walks along weeping,
carrying the bag of seed,
he will return with joyous song

The third blessing, beginning with “Have mercy,” was composed by David who conquered Jerusalem, and by Solomon who built the Temple. The fourth blessing “Who is good and beneficent to all” was composed by Rabban Gamliel the Elder and his court in Yavneh in gratitude to God for preserving the bodies of the victims of the Roman massacre at Betar, and for being enabled to bring them to proper burial.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 48b</i>

when the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
<small><i>On Purim:</i></small>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther

young and old, infants and women,
in one day, the thirteenth day

And You, in Your abundant mercy,
annulled his counsel,

Rebuild Jerusalem, city of the Holy Sanctuary,
speedily, in our days.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Builder of Jerusalem in His mercy. Amein.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It is unusual for one to answer Amein after his own blessing. This blessing ends with Amein because it marks the end of the three blessings, authority for which is derived from Deuteronomy (8:10) and separates them from the next blessing which is Rabbinic in origin.—<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 45b</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
the Almighty, our Father, our King,
our Mighty One, our Creator, our Redeemer,
our Maker, our Holy One, Holy One of Jacob,
our Shepherd, Shepherd of Israel,
the King, Who is good and beneficent to all.
Every single day He has done good,
does good, and will do good to us.
He has rewarded us, He rewards us,
He will reward us forever with
favor, kindness, and compassion,
relief, rescue, and success,
blessing, deliverance, and consolation,
maintenance, sustenance, compassion,
life, peace, and everything good;
and of all good things
may He never deprive us.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Many people are granted the bounties of life but are unable to enjoy them.

forever and ever.
The Merciful One will be blessed
in heaven and on earth.
The Merciful One will be praised

May the Merciful One
maintain us with honor.
The Merciful One will break the yoke

and lead us upright
to our land.
May the Merciful One send us
abundant blessing to this house,

The Merciful One will send us
Elijah the prophet,

Redemption of the Firstborn

The first born male child must be redeemed on the thirty-first day of his birth. If, however, the father is a Kohein or a Levite, or the mother a daughter of a Kohein or a Levite, they are exempt from the duty of redemption. Should the thirty-first day fall on a Shabbos or Yom Tov, the service is postponed until the next day.
<small><i>The father, presenting his child to the Kohein, makes the following declaration:</i></small>
This, my first born son,
is the first issue of his mother's womb,
and the Holy One, blessed is He
has commanded to redeem him,
as it is said:
And those that are to be redeemed of them,
from a month old shall you redeem them,
according to your estimation,
for the money of five silver shekalim,
of the shekel of the Sanctuary
which is equal to twenty <i>geirah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:16.</i>
And it is said:
Sanctify unto me all the firstborn,
whatsoever opens the womb
among the Children of Israel,
both of man and of beast is Mine.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 13:2.</i>
<small><i>The father then places before the Kohein silver dollars in the amount of fiveshekalim which is equal to five silver dollars, or according to some Poskim seven silver dollars, and the Kohein asks:</i></small>
Which do you prefer,
to give me your firstborn son
who is the first issue of his mother's womb,
or would you rather redeem him
for five shekalim,
as you are required to do by the Torah?
<small><i>The father replies:</i></small>
I wish to redeem my son
and here is the value of his redemption
which I am required to give
according to the Torah.
<small><i>While holding the silver dollars, the father says these two Berachos:</i></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us concerning
the redemption of the [firstborn] son.
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who has kept us alive and sustained us
and brought us to this time.
<small><i>The Kohein accepts the silver dollars, and holding it over the head of the child, says:</i></small>
This is instead of that,
this is in exchange for that,
this is pardoned for that.
May this child enter into life,
into the [study of] Torah,
chupah [the nuptial canopy] and good deeds.
Amein.
<small><i>The Kohein places his right hand upon the head of the child and blesses him:</i></small>
May God make you
as Ephraim and Menashe.
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.
Adonoy is your guardian;
Adonoy is your shelter at your right hand.
For length of days
and years of life and peace,
will He add to you.
Adonoy will guard you from all evil,
He will preserve your soul.
<small>The Kohein hands the child to the father.</small>
<small>The Kohein then takes a cup of wine and says:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who creates the fruit of the vine.

The Travelers' Prayer

Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,

[We thank You] for the miracles
for the redemption, for the mighty deeds,
for the deliverances, for the wonders
for the consolations and for the wars
that You performed for our fathers
in those days at this season.
<small>On Chanukah:</small>
In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons,
when the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
<small>On Purim:</small>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther
in Shushan the Capital [of Persia],
when the evil Haman rose up against them,
he sought to destroy, to kill,
and to annihilate all the Jews,
young and old, infants and women,
in one day, the thirteenth day
of the twelfth month,
which is the month of Adar,
and to plunder their wealth—
And You, in Your abundant mercy,
annulled his counsel,
frustrated his intention,
and brought his evil plan upon his own head,
and they hanged him and his sons
upon the gallows.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly, forever and ever.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</small>
Inscribe for a good life
all the children of Your covenant.
<small>If you forgot to say this, see page 000.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever
and praise and bless
Your great Name with sincerity forever;
for You are goodness—
the Almighty, Who is our deliverance
and our help forever—
the benevolent Almighty.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
“The Beneficent” is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.
<small>Birkas Kohanim is said by the Chazzan on public fast-days:</small>
<b>Birkas Kohanim</b>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us
with the threefold blessing of the Torah,
written by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
pronounced from the mouth of Aaron
and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people;
as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.
<small>After Birkas Kohanim the congregation says:</small>
Mighty One on high who dwells in might,
You are peace and Your Name is peace.
May it be Your will that You grant us
and all of Your people, the House of Israel
life and blessing
for a safeguard to peace.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing,
life favor, kindness and compassion
upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one
with the light of Your countenance.
For by the light of Your countenance
You gave us Adonoy our God,
a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,
righteousness, blessing, compassion,
life, and peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace
(with much strength and peace).
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</small>
In the book of life, blessing, peace
and abundant maintenance,
good decrees, salvations and condolences,
may we be remembered and inscribed
before You;
we and all Your people, the House of Israel
for a good life and peace.
<small>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil
and my lips from speaking deceitfully.
To those who curse me,
may my soul be unresponsive;
and let my soul be like dust to all.
Open my heart to Your Torah
and let my soul pursue Your commandments.
And all who plan evil against me,
quickly annul their counsel
and frustrate their intention.
(May it it be Your will
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that no person be envious of me
and that I not be envious of others,
that I not be brought to anger this day,
and that I not cause Your anger;
and save me from the evil inclination,
and help me be humble and any modest.
Our King and our Father,
unify Your Name in Your world,
rebuild Your city, establish Your house
and perfect your sanctuary.
Gather our exiles,
redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name.
Act for the sake of Your right hand.
Act for the sake of Your Torah.
Act for the sake of Your holiness.
In order that Your loved ones be released,
deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
<small>Biblical phrases applicable to one's name may be found on pp. 000-000.</small>
May they be acceptable—
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart—before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace
in His high heavens
may He make peace
upon us and upon all Israel
and say Amein.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days,
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.
And let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
as in the days of old and in earlier years.
<small>On days when <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted (see below) the chazzan continues with Kaddish. (14 and 15 Adar Rishon in a leap year); the entire month of Nissan; Pesach Sheini (14 Iyar); Lag BaOmer; 1-8 Sivan; 9 and 15 Av; and 29 Elul. When <i>Tachanun</i> is omitted on these days, it is also omitted at the preceding Mincha (afternoon service).</small>

Tachanun

<small><i>Tachanun</i> is also omitted in the presence of a bridegroom, in the house of a mourner during the week of mourning, and on the occasion of a circumcision if the father, the <i>sandak</i> or the <i>mohel</i> is present. The worshipper recites the <i>Tachanun</i> in a sitting position, while resting his brow on his arm. During the morning service, when the hand-<i>tefillin</i> is on the left arm, he leans his brow on his right arm, but at the Mincha service he leans his brow on his left arm. This "falling on one's face" symbolizes complete submission to God and the committing of our destinies into His hands. It is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Maseches Megillah</i> 22b), and originates with Moses, who "Fell down before God" (Deuteronomy 9:18) and was followed by Joshua, who "Fell on the earth upon his face before the Ark of God" (Joshua 7:6)</small>
Our God and God of our fathers,
let our prayer come before you
and do not ignore our supplication.
For we are not so brazen-faced
and stiff-necked
to say to you,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
We are righteous and have not sined.
But, indeed, we and our fathers have sinned.
We have trespassed [against God and man, and we are devastated by our guilt];
We have betrayed [God and man, we have been ungrateful for the good done to us];
We have stolen; We have slandered.
We have caused others to sin;
We have caused others to commit sins for which they are called רְשָׁעִים, wicked;
We have sinned with malicious intent;
We have forcibly taken other's possessions even though we paid for them;
We have added falsehood upon falsehood; we have joined with evil individuals or groups.
We have given harmful advice;
We have deceived; We have mocked;
We have rebelled against God and His Torah;
We have caused God to be angry with us;
We have turned away from God's Torah;
We have sinned deliberately;
We have been negligent in our performance of the commandments;
We have caused our friends grief;
We have been stiff-necked, refusing to admit that the cause of our suffering is our own sins.
We have committed sins for which we are called רָשָׁע [raising a hand to hit someone].
We have committed sins which are the result of moral corruption;
We have committed sins which the Torah refers to as abominations;
We have gone astray;
We have led others astray.
We have turned away
from Your commandments
and from Your good laws,
and we have gained nothing from it.
And You are the Righteous One
in all [punishment] that has come upon us;
for You have acted truthfully
and we have acted wickedly.
You are Almighty, Slow to anger,
Lord of Mercy, You are called,
and the way of repentance,
You have taught us.
The greatness of Your mercy and kindness,
remember this day and every day
for the descendants of Your loved ones.
Turn to us with compassion
for You are the Lord of Mercy.
With supplication and prayer
we approach Your Presence,
as You made know
to [Moses,] the modest one of old.
From Your fierce anger turn,
as it is written in Your Torah:
In the shadow of Your wings,
may we be sheltered and lodged,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
When Adonoy descended in the cloud.
Remove [our] transgression,
and blot out [our] iniquity,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
And He stood with him there.
Give ear to our cry
and listen to our speech,
as on the day [of which it is said:]
And He proclaimed in the Name, Adonoy
And there it is said:
<small><i>Congregation and Chazzan:</i></small>
And Adonoy passed before him [Moses]
and proclaimed:
Adonoy, Adonoy,
Almighty, Merciful, Gracious,
Slow to Anger,
and Abundant in Kindness and Truth.
Keeper of kindness
for thousands of generations,
Endurer of iniquity and transgression,
and sin,
and Acquitter of those who repent.
And pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for Your inheritance.
Pardon us,our Father, for we have sinned,
forgive us, our King, for we have transgressed.
For You, my Master,
are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.
<small>The following supplication is recited while resting your brow on your arm.</small>
And David said to Gad (II Samuel 24:14),
I am greatly distressed;
let us fall into the hand of Adonoy
for His mercies are great,
but into the hand of man let me not fall.
Merciful and gracious One,
I have sinned before You;
Adonoy, full of mercy,
have compassion upon me
and accept my supplications.
Adonoy, do not rebuke me with Your anger,
nor chastise me with Your rage.
Be gracious unto me, Adonoy,
for I am desolate,
heal me Adonoy, for my bones are terrified.
My soul, [too,] is utterly terrified,
and You Adonoy, how long?
Return Adonoy, free my soul,
deliver me
for the sake of Your lovingkindness.
For in death there is no mention of You;
in the lower world who will thank You.
I am worn out with my sighing,
every night I cause my bed to float;
with my tears, I melt my couch.
My eye is dimmed from anger,
it has aged because of my tormentors.
Depart from me, all you evildoers,
for Adonoy has heard
the voice of my weeping.
Adonoy has heard my supplication,
Adonoy will (also) accept my prayer.
Ashamed and utterly terrified
will all my foes be,
they will return
and be instantaneously ashamed.
Guardian of Israel,
guard the remnant of Israel,
and let not Israel perish,
who say, "Hear Israel."
Guardian of the unique nation,
guard the remnant of the unique people,
and let not the unique nation perish,
who proclaim the Oneness of Your Name,
[saying:] Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
Guardian of the holy nation,
guard the remnant of the holy people
and let not the holy nation perish
who repeat the threefold sanctification
to the Holy One.
You Who are appeased by pleas for mercy,
and conciliated by supplications,
be appeased and conciliated
to an afflicted generation,
for there is none else to help.
Our Father, our King!
be gracious to us and answer us
for we have no [good] deeds,
deal with us charitably and kindly
and deliver us.
As for us, we know not what to do;
but our eyes are upon You.
Remember Your mercies, Adonoy,
and kindnesses
for
they are from the beginning of the world.
Adonoy! may Your kindness be upon us,
as we have waited for You.
Remember not the sins of our ancestors;
let Your mercy come swiftly toward us,
for we have been brought very low.
Help us for the Name of Adonoy
Creator of Heaven and earth.
Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us
for we are saturated with humiliation.
[Even] in anger
remember to have compassion.
[Even] in anger
remember the binding of Isaac.
Even in anger
remember the uprightness of Jacob
Adonoy deliver [us]
the King will answer us on the day we call.
For He knows of what we are made;
He is mindful that we are but dust.
Help us, God of our deliverance,
for the sake of the glory of Your Name;
save us and atone our sins,
for the sake of Your Name.
<small>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance
of the prayers and supplications
of the entire House of Israel
before their Father in heaven.
And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and good life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace
(<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace)
in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
and say, Amein.

Aleinu

It is our obligation to praise
the Master of all,
to ascribe greatness
to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning:
that He has not made us
like the nations of the lands,
and has not positioned us
like the families of the earth;
that He has not assigned
our portion like theirs,
nor our lot like that of all their multitudes.
For they prostrate themselves
to vanity and nothingness,
and pray to a god that cannot deliver.
But we bow, prostrate ourselves,
and offer thanks
before the Supreme King of Kings,
the Holy One blessed is He,
Who spreads the heavens,
and establishes the earth,
and the seat of His glory is in heaven above,
and the abode of His invincible might
is in the loftiest heights.
He is our God, there is nothing else.
Our King is true,
all else is insignificant,
as it is written in His Torah:
“And You shall know this day
and take into Your heart
that Adonoy is God
in the heavens above
and upon the earth below;
there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You,
Adonoy our God,
to soon behold the glory of Your might
in banishing idolatry from the earth,
and the false gods will be utterly exterminated
to perfect the world
as the kingdom of Shadai.
And all mankind will invoke Your Name,
to turn back to You,
all the wicked of the earth.
They will realize and know,
all the inhabitants of the world,
that to You, every knee must bend,
every tongue must swear [allegiance to You].
Before You, Adonoy, our God,
they will bow and prostrate themselves,
and to the glory of Your Name give honor.
And they will all accept [upon themselves]
the yoke of Your kingdom,
and You will reign over them, soon,
forever and ever.
For the kingdom is Yours,
and to all eternity You will reign in glory,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“Adonoy will reign forever and ever.”
And it is said:
“And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.”
Do not fear sudden terror
nor the destruction of the wicked
when it comes.
Take counsel together and it will be foiled
speak the word and it will not stand
for God is with us.
To your old age I am [with you],
to your older years I will sustain you,
I have made you, and I will carry you,
I will sustain you and save you.
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and good life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace
(<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace)
in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
and say, Amen.
<small>The following is recited here by some congregations from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres. Others recite it at the end of the Maariv (Evening) Service.</small>
By David:
Adonoy is my light and my salvation,
whom shall I fear?
Adonoy is the strength of my life,
of whom shall I be afraid?
When evildoers approach me
to devour my flesh—
my tormentors and my foes
they stumble and fall.
If an army should encamp against me,
my heart would not fear;
if war were to rise against me,
in this I trust.
One thing I request of Adonoy,
[only] that shall I seek,
that I may dwell in the House of Adonoy
all the days of my life,
to behold the pleasantness of Adonoy,
and to meditate in His Sanctuary.
For He will hide me in His Tabernacle
on the day of distress,
He will conceal me in the shelter of His Tent,
upon a rock He will lift me.
And now my head is raised high
above my enemies around me;
and I will offer in His Tent,
sacrifices accompanied by trumpets of joy;
I will sing and chant to Adonoy.
Adonoy, hear my voice when I call;
be gracious to me and answer me.
Of You, my heart has said,
“Seek My Presence”;
Your Presence, Adonoy I will seek.
Conceal not Your Presence from me,
do not turn away Your servant in anger.
You have been my help;
neither cast me off nor abandon me,
God of my deliverance.
When my father and mother abandon me,
Adonoy will gather me up.
Adonoy, teach me Your way,
and lead me in the path of uprightness,
because of my watchers.
Do not deliver me
to the will of my tormentors,
for false witnesses have risen against me,
who breathe violence.
Had I not believed that I would see
the goodness of Adonoy
in the land of living.
Hope to Adonoy,
be strong and He will give you courage;
and hope to Adonoy.
<small>Mourner's Kaddish is said here:</small>
<small>The Psalm said in the house of a mourner is found on page 000.</small>

Maariv

Berachos Preceding Shema

<small>Unlike the morning <i>Shacharis</i> and afternoon <i>Mincha</i> services which correspond to the two daily communal sacrifices (<i>Tamid</i>), offered in the Temple, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, the evening <i>Maariv</i> service has no counterpart in the Temple service, since sacrifices were never brought at night in the Temple.</small>
<small>The <i>Maariv</i> service was instituted to correspond to the Temple ritual of keeping on the altar the unconsumed parts of sacrifices that had been offered earlier in the day. These parts were kept on the altar at night so that they could be completely consumed by its fire. This ritual was applicable only if there actually were uncon- sumed parts of offerings.</small>
<small>Although the <i>Maariv</i> service was instituted to correspond to this ritual, and may therefore seem to be non-obligatory (see <i>Maseches Berachos</i> 27b), Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi and all the other codifiers have ruled that <i>Maariv</i> has been accepted and hallowed by custom, and is therefore an obligatory service.</small>
<small>The <i>Shema</i> is preceded by two blessings and followed by two other blessings.</small>
And He, the Merciful One,
atones iniquity; and does not destroy.
He frequently withdraws His anger
and does not arouse all His rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 78:38. This verse consists of thirteen Hebrew words. It recalls the “thirteen attributes of Divine mercy” (Exodus 34:67). In the evening when man pauses from the rush of his daily activities, he is conscious of having sinned during the day, and thus begins his prayer with this appeal for Divine mercy.—<i>Machzor Vitry</i><br>Midrash Tanchuma (<i>Pinchos</i> 13) notes that the morning sacrifice (תמיד של שחר) atoned for sins committed during the night, while the afternoon sacrifice (תמיד של בין הערבים) atoned for sins committed during the day. Since the evening service does not represent Temple sacrifice, it became customary to recite this verse because it mentions that God “atones iniquity.”—<i>Avudraham</i></i>
Adonoy, deliver [us!]
The King will answer us on the day we call.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 20:10.</i>
<small>The <i>Chazzan</i> says:</small>
Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</small>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed
forever and ever.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe,
With His word He brings on evenings,
with wisdom He opens the gates<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These are the gates of sunrise and sunset through which God, in His infinite wisdom, has divided life on earth into two complementary halves.—<i>Rabbi S.R. Hirsch</i></i> (of heaven);
and with understanding
changes<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He alternates the three daily periods—evening, morning, and afternoon.—<i>Avudraham</i></i> the times
and alternates the seasons,
and arranges the stars
in their watches,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The stars appear as watchmen appointed by God to stand guard over the sleeping world below. He also appointed them their places in definite orbits, according to His will, and for purposes known to Him alone.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> in the sky,
according to His will.
He creates day and night,
He rolls the light away from before darkness,
and darkness from before light;
He causes day to pass
and brings night,
and separates between day and night;
Adonoy of Hosts<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">His Name, ה’ צבאות, means “He Who takes all the infinite variety of hosts and creatures and unites them to act and interact as parts of one unified Universe.”—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i> is His Name.
The Almighty,
[Who is] living and enduring
will always reign over us
forever and ever.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who brings on evening.
[With] An everlasting love<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer is an abbreviated form of the אהבה רבה prayer in the morning service. It thanks God for the sacred gift of Divine Revelation that He granted Israel. It declares that Torah alone is the eternal heritage of the Jewish people and that all other goods and gifts of life are transitory.—<i>S.R. Hirsch</i></i>
You loved the House of Israel, Your people.
Torah and commandments,
statutes and laws,
You taught us.
Therefore, Adonoy, our God,
when we lie down and when we rise,
we will discuss Your statutes,
and rejoice
in the words of the teachings of Your Torah
and in Your commandments forever.
For they are our life
and they lengthen our days,
and on them we will meditate day and night.
[May] Your love
never be removed from us
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who loves His people Israel.

Shema

<small>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
<b>Hear, Israel:</b>
<b>Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.</b>
<small>The following three lines are to be said silently:</small>
Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.
And you shall love Adonoy your God
with all your heart
and with all your soul
and with all your possessions.
And these words
which I command you today,
shall be upon your heart.
And you shall teach them sharply
to your children.
And you shall discuss them
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall bind them for a sign
upon your hand,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.
And it will be—
if you vigilantly obey My commandments
which I command you this day,
to love Adonoy your God,
and serve Him
with your entire hearts
and with your entire souls—
that I will give rain for your land
in its proper time,
the early (autumn) rain
and the late (spring) rain;
and you will harvest your grain
and your wine and your oil.
And I will put grass
in your fields for your cattle,
and you will eat and be satisfied.
Beware lest your hearts be swayed
and you turn astray,
and you worship alien gods
and bow to them.
And Adonoy's fury will blaze among you,
and He will close off the heavens
and there will be no rain
and the earth will not yield its produce;
and you will perish swiftly
from the good land
which Adonoy gives you.
Place these words of Mine
upon your hearts and upon your souls,—
and bind them for a sign
upon your hands,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.
And you shall teach them to your sons,
to speak them
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.
In order that your days be prolonged,
and the days of your children,
upon the land
which Adonoy swore to your fathers
to give them [for as long]
as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying:
Speak to the children of Israel,
and tell them
to make for themselves fringes
on the corners of their garments
throughout their generations;
and they will place with the fringes
of each corner
a thread of blue.
And it will be to you for fringes,
and you will look upon it
and you will remember
all the commandments of Adonoy,
and you will perform them;
and you will not turn aside after your hearts
and after your eyes
which cause you to go astray.
In order that you will remember
and perform all My commandments;
and you will be holy unto your God.
I am Adonoy, your God,
Who brought you out
of the land of Egypt
to be your God:
I am Adonoy, your God—
<small>  You must be careful to connect the last words of Shema,  ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם  (Adonoy, your God), with the word  אֶמֶת  (is true) without pause or interruption so that these three words form one sentence, meaning “Adonoy your God is true” (Maseches Berachos 13a).</small>
—is true—
<small>The chazan repeats:</small>
Adonoy, your God, is true.

<small>The following prayer was originally a compilation of eighteen verses instituted during the Gaonic era as a substitute for the <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> According to Avudraham, the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> was omitted because of decrees issued against the Jews that banned them from participating in the Evening Service. These eighteen verses, adopted in place of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei,</i> have remained a part of the <i>Maariv</i> service. Some Halachic commentaries maintain that these verses should not be included in <i>Maariv,</i> because they constitute an interruption between the final blessing after Shema and the <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i></small>

In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons,
when the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
<small>On Purim:</small>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther
in Shushan the Capital [of Persia],
when the evil Haman rose up against them,
he sought to destroy, to kill,
and to annihilate all the Jews,
young and old, infants and women,
in one day, the thirteenth day
of the twelfth month,
which is the month of Adar,
and to plunder their wealth—
And You, in Your abundant mercy,
annulled his counsel,
frustrated his intention,
and brought his evil plan upon his own head,
and they hanged him and his sons
upon the gallows.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly, forever and ever.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</small>

He who dwells
in the shelter of the Supreme One,
under the protection of Shadai he will abide.
I say of Adonoy,
[He is] my refuge and my stronghold,
my God in Whom I trust.
For He will save you from the snare-trap,
from destructive pestilence.
With His wings He will cover you
and beneath His wings, you will find refuge;
His truth is a shield, a full shield.
You will not fear the terror of night,
nor the arrow that flies by day.
The pestilence that prowls in darkness,
nor the deadly plague that ravages at noon.
A thousand will fall at your [left] side,
and ten thousand at your [right] side
but it shall not come near you.
Only with your eyes will you behold
and see the punishment of the wicked.
For you [have proclaimed]:
“Adonoy is my refuge,”
the Supreme One
you have made your dwelling.
No evil shall befall you,
and no plague shall come near your tent.
For His angels
He will command on your behalf—
to guard you in all your ways.
They will carry you upon their hands,
lest you hurt your foot on a rock.
You will tread upon lion and snake,
you will trample young lion and serpent.
Because he clings to Me with desire,
I will save him;
I will strengthen him,
for he knows My Name.
When he calls upon Me, I will answer him;
I am with him in distress,
I will free him and honor him.
I will satiate him with longevity,
and will let him see My deliverance.
I will satiate him with longevity,

And You, Holy One,
are enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
And [the angels] call one to another and say:
“Holy, holy, holy
is Adonoy of Hosts:
the fullness of all the earth is His glory.”
And they receive [sanction] one from another,
and say,
“Holy in the highest heights of heaven,
the abode of His Divine Presence;
holy upon earth,
the work of His mighty power;
holy forever and to all eternity—
is Adonoy of Hosts;
the whole earth is filled
with the radiance of His glory.”
And a wind lifted me;
and I heard behind me
the sound of a great rushing;
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy
from His place.”
“And a wind lifted me

a sound of a great rushing
of those who uttered praises and said,
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy
from the place,
the abode of His Divine Presence.”
Adonoy will reign forever and ever.
Adonoy, His kingdom is established
forever and to all eternity.
Adonoy,
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
our fathers,
keep this forever
as the intention of the hearts of Your people,
and direct their hearts to You.
And He, the merciful One,
atons iniquity and does ot destroy;
He frequently withdraws His anger
and does not arouse all His rage.
For You, my Master, are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.
Your righteousness is everlasting
and Your Torah is truth.
You will grant truth to Jacob
kindliness to Abraham,
as You have sworn to our fathers
from the days of old.
Blessed is my Master day by day;
He loads us,
the Almighty Who is our deliverance,
forever.
Adonoy of Hosts is with us
a stronghold for us
is the God of Jacob, <i>selah.</i>
Adonoy of Hosts,
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver [us];
the King will answer us on the day we call.
Blessed is He, our God,
Who created us for His glory,
and set us apart from those who go astray;
and gave us the Torah of truth,
and eternal life He implanted within us.
May He open our heart to His Torah,
and instill in our heart love and awe of Him,
to do His will and serve Him
with a perfect heart,
so that we shall not labor in vain
nor bring forth that which causes dismay.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
that we keep Your statutes in this world,
and [thus] be privileged to live and behold,
and to inherit the goodness and blessing
of the Messianic days
and in the life of the World to Come.
In order that my soul sing to You
and not be stilled;
Adonoy, my God, forever will I thank You.
Blessed is the man who trusts in Adonoy,
so that Adonoy is his security.
Trust in Adonoy until the end of days,
for in God,
Adonoy, is the strength of the worlds.
Those who know your Name will trust in You,
for You have never forsaken
those who seek You, Adonoy.
Adonoy desired,
for the sake of His righteousness,
to make the Torah great and to glorify it.

Aleinu

<small>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance
of the prayers and supplications
of the entire House of Israel
before their Father in heaven.
And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
It is our obligation to praise
the Master of all,
to ascribe greatness
to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning:
that He has not made us
like the nations of the lands,
and has not positioned us
like the families of the earth;
that He has not assigned
our portion like theirs,
nor our lot like that of all their multitudes.
For they prostrate themselves
to vanity and nothingness,
and pray to a god that cannot deliver.
But we bow, prostrate ourselves,
and offer thanks
before the Supreme King of kings,
the Holy One blessed is He,
Who spreads the heavens,
and establishes the earth,
and the Seat of His glory is in heaven above,
and the abode of His invincible might
is in the loftiest heights.
He is our God, there is nothing else.
Our King is true,
all else is insignificant,
as it is written in His Torah:
“And you shall know this day
and take into your heart
that Adonoy is God
in the heavens above
and upon the earth below;
there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You,
Adonoy our God,
to soon behold the glory of Your might
in banishing idolatry from the earth
and the false gods
will be utterly exterminated
to perfect the world
as the kingdom of Shadai.
And all mankind will invoke Your Name,
to turn back to You,
all the wicked of the earth.
They will realize and know,
all the inhabitants of the world,
that to You, every knee must bend,
every tongue must swear [allegiance to You].
Before You, Adonoy, our God,
they will bow and prostrate themselves,
and to the glory of Your Name give honor.
And they will all accept [upon themselves]
the yoke of Your kingdom,
and You will reign over them, soon,
forever and ever.
For the kingdom is Yours,
and to all eternity You will reign in glory,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“Adonoy will reign forever and ever.”
And it is said:
“And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.”
Do not fear sudden terror
nor the destruction of the wicked
when it comes.
Take counsel together and it will be foiled
speak the word and it will not stand
for God is with us.
To your old age I am [with you],
to your older years I will sustain you,
I have made you, and I will carry you,
I will sustain you and save you.
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.

Counting the Omer

<small>The Omer is counted from the second night of Pesach until the night before Shavuos. The counting of forty-nine days (seven weeks) between the Festival of Pesach and Shavuos (the Feast of Weeks), connects the exodus from Egypt with the festival of the giving of the Torah. Just as one who awaits a most intimate friend on a certain day counts the days in eager anticipation of his arrival, so do we count the days from our liberation till the day we receive the Torah, which is the culmination and fulfillment of our freedom.</small>
<small>It is proper to count the Omer at the beginning of the night, usually after the Maariv Service, and the Omer should be counted while standing.</small>
I am prepared and ready to perform
the affirmative command to count the Omer,
as it is written in the Torah,
And you shall count for yourselves,
from the day after the day of rest,
from the day you bring
the <i>omer</i> as the wave-offering,
seven complete weeks shall there be;
until the day following the seventh week
shall you count fifty days;
and you shall bring a
new meal-offering unto Adonoy.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us to count the Omer.

















































The Merciful One, may He return for us
the service of the Beis Hamikdash in its place
speedily in our days, Amein, <i>Selah.</i>

To Him, Who grants victory:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 67 is recited because the seven verses which follow the introductory verse contain 49 words corresponding to the seven weeks (49 days) that link Pesach to the giving of the Torah on Shavuos.</i>
a psalm with instrumental music, a song.
[May] God favor us and bless us,
[may He] cause His countenance to shine
among us forever;
[so] that Your way become known on earth,
[and] Your deliverance among all nations.
Peoples will thank You, God,
all the peoples will thank You.
Nations will rejoice and sing
when You judge the peoples justly,
and lead the nations upon the earth forever.
Peoples will thank You, God,
all the peoples will thank You.
The earth will have yielded its produce;
God, our God, will have blessed us.
God will bless us,
and they will fear Him—
all [men even from] the ends of the earth.
Please, by the force of Your great right hand,
release the bound one.
Accept the prayer of Your people;
strengthen us, purify us, awesome One!
Please mighty One—
those who seek Your unity—
preserve them like the apple [of Your eye.]
Bless them,
purify them, have mercy on them;
Your benevolent righteousness
[may You] always bestow upon them.
Mighty, Holy One
in Your abundant goodness
lead Your community.
Unique One, Exalted, turn to Your people
who are mindful of Your holiness.
Accept our prayer and hear our cry,
[You] Who knows hidden thoughts.
Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious Kingdom
is forever and ever.
Master of the universe,
You commanded us
through the hands of Your servant, Moses,
to count the Omer
in order to purify us
from our evil and defilement.
As You have written in Your Torah:
And you shall count for yourselves,
from the day after the day of rest,
from the day you bring
the <i>omer</i> as the wave-offering,
seven complete weeks, shall there be;
until the day following the seventh week
shall you count fifty days,
in order to cleanse
the souls of Your people Israel
from their impurities.
Therefore, may it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
that in the merit of the Omer
which I counted today,
may any defect I have caused be rectified.

May I be purified and sanctified
with sublime holiness,
and thereby
may abundant bounty be bestowed
upon all the worlds.
May it rectify our being,
our spirit and our souls
from every baseness and defect,
and may it purify us and sanctify us
with Your sublime holiness.
Amen, Selah.

Prayer Before Retiring at Night

<small>The following is Omitted on the Shabbat and Festivals.</small>
Master of the universe!
I hearby forgive
anyone who has angered me,
or sinned against me,
either physically or financially,
against my honor or anything that is mine,
whether accidentally or intentionally,
inadvertently or deliberately,
by speech or by deed,
in this incarnation
or in any other
any Israelite [is forgiven],
may no man be punished on my account.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that I shall sin no more
nor repeat my sins,
neither shall I again anger You
nor do what is wrong in Your eyes.
The sins I have committed,
erase in your abounding mercies,
but not through suffering or severe illnesses.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe,
Who causes the fetters of sleep to fall
upon my eyes,
and slumber upon my eyelids.
And illuminates the pupil of the eye.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers
to make me lie down in peace,
and to raise me (again)
to good life and peace,
and grant me my portion in Your Torah,
make us accustomed to do Your commands,
and let us not become accustomed to sin,
Do not bring us
into the grasp of sin,
Do not cause us to be tested,
or brought to disgrace.
May I be ruled by the Good Inclination
and let me not be ruled over
by the Evil Inclination.
Protect me from Satan,
from an evil mishap and from illnesses.
Let my thoughts not terrify me—
nor evil dreams
or evil fancies (disturb me),
and may my bed be perfect before You.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word “bed” is used here figuratively for one’s future generations.

And light up my eyes

Who illuminates the whole world

He will command on your behalf—

Berachos on Lulav

<small>Many recite the following prayer before taking the four species (Lulav).</small>

Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
concerning the taking of the lulav.
<small>If you are taking the lulav for the first time on Sukkos, you should also recite:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe
Who has kept us alive and sustained us
and brought us to this time.

Hallel

<small>Hallel, the name especially applied to <i>Psalms</i> 113-118, is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Pesachim</i> 117a), when Rabbi Judah quoted Samuel as saying “Who recited this Hallel? (Who ordained that this Hallel be read?) The prophets ordained that Israel should recite Hallel when they are redeemed from misfortune as an expression of gratitude for their redemption.”</small>
<small>In time, the Rabbis made the reading of Hallel obligatory on the major festivals such as Pesach, Shavuos, and Sukkos. Since Maccabean times, Chanukah is like- wise marked by the reading of Hallel. On Purim the reading of the <i>Scroll of Esther</i> takes the place of Hallel. (<i>Maseches Megillah</i> 14a)</small>
<small>The reading of Hallel on Rosh Chodesh is not rabbinically ordained, but a <i>minhag,</i> a custom which began with the Jews of Babylon in the second century, and has been accepted by all Israel as an obligatory Service. Because it is a minor festival, the Hallel is shortened on Rosh Chodesh by omitting half of <i>Psalms</i> 115 and 116. On the last six days of Pesach also, only “half”-Hallel is recited to show that our joy is diminished because of the drowning of the Egyptians.</small>
<small>Hallel is omitted in a house of mourning (during the week of <i>shiv'ah</i>) on Rosh Chodesh and Chanukah.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us to read the Hallel.

<small>As a segulah for long life, some people say the following verse on Rosh Chodesh:</small>

<small>The Service continues with the Order of Reading the Torah.  After the conclusion of the Torah reading, אַשְׁרֵי (Fortunate), and וּבָא לְצִיוֹן  (The Redeemer will come), are said. The Chazzan recites  <i>Half-Kaddish</i> , the Tefillin are then removed and the Congregation says the <i> Musaf Amidah</i>.</small>

your God, Zion, throughout all generations!
Praise God.”
<small>The Chazzan concludes:</small>
From generation to generation
we will declare Your greatness,
and to all eternity,
we will sanctify Your holiness,
and Your praise, our God,
will not depart from our mouths
forever and ever;
because You are the Almighty
Who is King; Great, and Holy.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
the Almighty, the Holy One.
<small>During the silent Shemoneh Esrei, continue here:</small>
<b>DIVINE SANCTIFICATION</b>
You are holy and Your Name is holy
and holy beings
praise You every day, forever.
because You are the Almighty
Who is King; Great, and Holy.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
the Almighty, the Holy One.
You chose us from [among] all the peoples;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For you are a holy people unto Adonoy, your God; Adonoy your God has chosen you to be a treasured people unto Him above all the peoples that are upon the face of the earth.—Deuteronomy 7:6</i>

You exalted us above all tongues,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">To make you high above all nations which He made — that you be a holy people unto Adonoy, your God, as He has spoken.—Deuteronomy 26:18-19</i>

You have pronounced upon us.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">And all the peoples of the earth will see that the Name of Adonoy is proclaimed upon you and they will fear you.—Deuteronomy 28:10</i>

appointed festivals for rejoicing,
festivals and seasons for happiness,
this day of
<small>On Pesach:</small>
the Festival of Matzos,
the season of our freedom,
<small>On Sukkos:</small>
the Festival of Sukkos,
the season of our rejoicing.
a day of holy assembly
commemorating the exodus from Egypt.
But because of our sins,
we were exiled from our land,
and driven far away from our soil;
and we are unable to go up,
[in order] to appear
and to prostrate ourselves before You,
and to perform our obligatory offerings
in Your chosen House,
in the great and holy House
upon which Your Name is proclaimed,
because of the hand [of violence]
that was sent against Your Sanctuary.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The enemy spread out his hand over all her treasures; she [Jerusalem] saw nations invade her sanctuary.—Lamentations 1:10</i>
May it be Your will
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
merciful King,
to once again have compassion on us,
and on Your Sanctuary
in Your abundant mercy;
and rebuild it soon
and greatly enhance its glory.
Our Father, our King!
Reveal the glory of Your kingship
upon us soon,
appear and be uplifted over us
before the eyes of all living things.
Bring near our scattered [people]
from among the nations,
and gather our dispersed
from the ends of the earth.
Bring us to Zion, Your city, with joyous song,
to Jerusalem, house of Your Sanctuary,
with everlasting joy.
And there we will offer before You
our obligatory sacrifices,

<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
Be pleased, Adonoy, our God,
with Your people Israel and their prayer,
and restore the service
to the Holy of Holies in Your abode,
and the fire-offerings of Israel;
and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly.
And may You always find pleasure
with the service of Your people, Israel.
And may our eyes behold
Your merciful return to Zion.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
<small>At the words, <i>We are thankful</i>, bend forward; at <i>Adonoy</i> return to an upright position.</small>
We are thankful to You
that You Adonoy are our God
and the God of our fathers forever;
our Rock, Rock of our lives,
the Shield of our deliverance,
You are in every generation.
We will give thanks to You
and recount Your praise,
for our lives
which are committed into Your hand.
And for our souls which are entrusted to You,
and for Your miracles of every day with us
and for Your wonders and benefactions
at all times—
evening, morning and noon.
(You are) The Beneficent One—
for Your compassion is never withheld;
And (You are) the Merciful One—
for Your kindliness never ceases;
we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</small>
We are thankful to You,
that You Adonoy are our God
and God of our fathers,
God of all flesh,
Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning.
Blessings and thanksgivings
to Your great and holy Name
for keeping us alive, and sustaining us;
so may You always keep us alive
and sustain us,
and gather our exiles
to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary
to observe Your statutes
and to do Your will,
and to serve You wholeheartedly
for we are thankful to You.
Blessed is the Almighty
to Whom all thanks are due.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly, forever and ever.
And all the living shall thank You forever
and praise and bless
Your great Name with sincerity forever;
for You are goodness—
the Almighty, Who is our deliverance
and our help forever—
the benevolent Almighty.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
“The Beneficent” is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.
<small>When Kohanim are present, the Birkas Kohanim is recited here, If no Kohanim are present, the Chazan recites the following.</small>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us
with the threefold blessing of the Torah,
written by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
pronounced from the mouth of Aaron
and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people;
as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing,
life favor, kindness and compassion
upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one
with the light of Your countenance.
For by the light of Your countenance
You gave us Adonoy our God,
a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,
righteousness, blessing, compassion,
life, and peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace
(with much strength and peace).
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil
and my lips from speaking deceitfully.
To those who curse me,
may my soul be unresponsive;
and let my soul be like dust to all.
Open my heart to Your Torah
and let my soul pursue Your commandments.
And all who plan evil against me,
quickly annul their counsel
and frustrate their intention.
(May it it be Your will
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that no person be envious of me
and that I not be envious of others,
that I not be brought to anger this day,
and that I not cause Your anger;
and save me from the evil inclination,
and help me be humble and any modest.
Our King and our Father,
unify Your Name in Your world,
rebuild Your city, establish Your house
and perfect your sanctuary.
Gather our exiles,
redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name.
Act for the sake of Your right hand.
Act for the sake of Your Torah.
Act for the sake of Your holiness.
In order that Your loved ones be released,
deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
<small>Biblical phrases applicable to one's name may be found on pp. 000-000.</small>
May they be acceptable—
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart—before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace
in His high heavens
may He make peace
upon us and upon all Israel
and say Amein.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days,
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.
And let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Chanukah Service

<small>The festival of Chanukah begins on the 25th day of Kislev and lasts eight days. The Chanukah lights should be kindled as soon as possible after nightfall. On Friday the Chanukah lights are kindled <i>before</i> the Sabbath candles are lit. On the first night of Chanukah, one light is kindled—at the right of the menorah. Each night thereafter one light is added—to the immediate left of the one kindled the preceding night. <i>The newly-added light is always kindled first</i>, and the kindling then proceeds toward the right.</small>
<small><i>Before kindling the lights, the following blessings are recited.</i></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
to kindle the light of Chanukah.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who performed miracles for our fathers
in those days at this time.
<small><i>The following blessing is said only on the first evening: </i></small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who has kept us alive and sustained us
and brought us to this time.
<small><i>After kindling the lights, the following is said: </i></small>
We kindle these lights
because of the miracles and the wonders,
the deliverances and the battles
which You performed for our fathers
in those days at this time
through Your holy priests.
All eight days of Chanukah
these lights are sacred,
And we are not permitted to make use of them,
but only to look at them,
in order to offer thanks and praise
to Your great Name
for Your miracles, for Your deliverance,
and for Your wonders.
Stronghold, Rock of my deliverance,
it is fitting to offer praise to You.
You will establish the House of my prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Temple.</i>
and there we will offer thanksgiving offerings.
When You prepare total destruction
against the raging foe,
I will then complete, with song and psalm,
the dedication of the Altar.
My soul was sated with troubles,
my strength consumed with sorrow;
they made my life bitter with hardship,
enslaved by the kingdom of the heifer [Egypt].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In Jeremiah 46:20, Egypt is likened to a young, beautiful heifer.</i>
With His great hand,
He brought forth the treasured [people],
[while] Pharaoh’s army and all his seed,
sank like a stone into the deep.
He brought me to His Holy of Holies
but even there, I found no rest;
the oppressor came and exiled me,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The king of Babylon exiled us to Babylon.</i>
because I had served alien gods
and I prepared poisoned wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Jews were dazed and intoxicated with the wine of the pagans, which was poison for them.</i>

To cut down the lofty cypress<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mordechai.</i>
was the intention of the Aggagite,
son of Hamedasa;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Hainan's plan to destroy Mordechai by hanging.</i>
it became [however] his own trap and snare,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Haman was ultimately hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordechai.</i>
and his arrogance was put to rest.
You raised the head of the Binjaminite<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Mordechai was of the tribe of Benjamin.</i>
and You blotted out the name of the foe,
his numerous sons and wealth;
You hanged upon the gallows.
The Greeks gathered against me
in the days of the Hasmoneans;
and broke down the walls of my towers,
and defiled all the [sacred] oils.
And from the last of the remaining flasks,
a miracle was performed for the Shoshanim<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The term שושנים, roses, is used in Scripture in reference to the Jewish People.</i>
Men of insight [then] designated eight days
for song and joyful psalms.
Uncover Your holy arm
and bring near the day of deliverance;
Avenge the blood of Your servants
from the wicked people.
For long have we waited for the deliverance,
and there is no end to the evil days.
Cast the “red one”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Esau.</i> into the dark shadows<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">We ask God to destroy Esau, the arch-enemy of the Jewish People. Esau is referred to as “the red one” in Genesis 25:25.</i>

Purim Service

<small>Everyone is obligated to hear the reading of the Megillah on the night of Purim and again on the day of Purim itself. The following three blessings are recited by the Reader.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
concerning the reading of the Megillah.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who performed miracles for our fathers
in those days at this time.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who has kept us alive and sustained us
and brought us to this time.
<small>After the reading of the Megillah, if there is a minyan of ten adult males present, the following is recited.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who defends our cause,
judges our grievances,
takes vengeance for us,
brings retribution
upon all our mortal enemies
and exacts payment [punishment]
from our oppressors.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who exacts payment [punishment]
in behalf of His people, Israel
from all their oppressors,
