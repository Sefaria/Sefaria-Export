Shabbat Siddur Sefard Linear

Eiruv Tavshilin

<small>When Yom Tov occurs on Thursday and Friday, an eiruv tavshilin must be prepared on the preceding Wednesday. The head of the family should take bread or matzoh and an item of cooked food such as meat or fish, put them on a plate and say the following berachah:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
concerning the mitzvah of <i>eiruv.</i>
By means of this <i>eiruv</i>
it will be permissible for us
to bake, cook, keep dishes warm,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">﻿“Keeping dishes warm” means that we are permitted to place cooked foods on a covered stove in order to preserve their heat. An example of this is the traditional Cholent. Kindling of light refers to the transferral of fire from an existing fire.</i>
to kindle a light (from an existing flame),
and to prepare and do all our necessities
on the Festival for the needs of Shabbos,
for us and for all Jews<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Rav of the community usually includes the community in his eiruv. This can be done however by anyone. It is done by handing over the cooked food to another person through whom he grants a share of the food (of the eiruv) to the entire community. This person raises the eiruv a tefach (handsbreadth) and returns it to the one making the eiruv.</i>
who live in this city.
<small>The food of the eiruv should be eaten at one of the Shabbos meals.</small>

Eiruvei Chatzeiros

<small>Two or more Jews who share a courtyard or hall, each of them living in his own apartment, are forbidden on Shabbos to carry from their apartment into the courtyard or hall, or from the courtyard or hall into their apartment. It is therefore considered a mitzvah for them to make an <i>eiruvei chatzeiros.</i></small>
<small>The procedure is as follows. Erev Shabbos, one of the tenants takes a whole loaf of bread and confers a share of it to all tenants of the courtyard by handing it to another tenant and saying in whatever language he understands: “Take this loaf of bread and acquire it on behalf of all the Jews who live in this courtyard.” This person then takes the loaf and raises it one <i>tefach.</i> The one who is making the <i>eiruv</i> takes it from him and recites the following berachah:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
concerning the mitzvah of <i>eiruv.</i>
By means of this <i>eiruv</i>
it will be permissible for us
to take out and to bring in
from the houses into the courtyard
and from the courtyard into the houses
and from one house into another,
for all the Jews
who live in the houses of the courtyard.

Eiruvei Techumin

<small>On Shabbos and Yom Tov, you are forbidden to go more than 2,000 <i>amos</i> from the place you were at the onset of Shabbos. If you need to walk farther than the Shabbos <i>techum</i> or boundary, you must place an <i>eiruvei techumin</i> (a boundary <i>eiruv</i>) before Shabbos or Yom Tov.</small>
<small>The procedure is as follows. You should take enough bread for two meals and go to the place where the <i>eiruv</i> is to be placed (within the 2,000 <i>amos</i>) and recite the following berachah:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
concerning the mitzvah of <i>eiruv.</i>
By means of this <i>eiruv</i>
it will be permissible for me
to walk from this place two thousand <i>amos</i>
in each direction.”
<small>You may place one <i>eiruv</i> for many Shabbosos, but you should put it in a safe place, so that it will not be lost or spoiled.</small>

Candle Lighting

Candle Lighting for Shabbos

<small>The <i>berachah</i> for all mitzvos must be recited before doing the mitzvah. This rule, however, does not apply to the lighting of the Shabbos candles. By lighting the candles, the woman thereby ushers in the Shabbos. Since the recitation of the <i>berachah </i> is considered to be the beginning of the act of candle lighting, she has thereby ushered in the Shabbos and may no longer light the candles. Therefore, she should first light the candles, and in order that the <i>berachah</i> precede the actual mitzvah, she should cover her face with her hands in order not to see the candles, then recite the <i>berachah</i>, remove her hands and look at the candles. In this manner, it is as if she has recited the <i>berachah</i> before lighting the candles.</small>
<small>It is customary for the husband to prepare the candles and wicks before Shabbos.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
to kindle the Shabbos light.

Candle Lighting for Yom Tov

Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
to kindle the Yom Tov light.
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who has kept us alive and sustained us
and brought us to this season.

Candle Lighting when Shabbos occurs on Yom Tov

Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
to kindle the Shabbos light
and Yom Tov light.
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who has kept us alive and sustained us
and brought us to this season.

Song of Songs

Preface to Shir Hashirim

<b>Preface to Shir Hashirim</b>
<small>Shir Hashirim, the Song of Songs, which is traditionally read in the syna- gogue on Shabbos Chol Hamoed Pesach, is one of the most remarkable books in the sacred Scriptures. On the face of it, it appears nothing more than an oriental love song. If that literal interpretation is accepted, there is no place for it in Holy Writ, and in fact it was not included without a controversy. It was only due to the strenuous advocacy of Rabbi Akiva that all doubts as to its propriety were dis- pelled. “Heaven forbid!” he said. “There could never be any doubt about the sanctity of Shir Hashirim. If the rest of the Writings are holy, then Shir Hashirim is the holy of holies.” (Mishnah, Yedayim 3:5) He saw in it, the passionate yearning which subsists between God and Israel, a love which “Many waters cannot quench, neither can the rivers drown” (8:7).</small>
<small>Thus, Shir Hashirim is read on the Festival of Pesach as an expression of our love of God Who brought us out of bondage and took us as His beloved people. It also expresses our belief that His love for our Patriarchs was the Divine motivation for our redemption and our selection as His cherished nation.</small>





Chapter 1

The song of songs which is Shlomo's.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When God gave the Torah to Israel, He spoke to them פָּנִים אֶל פָּנִים , face to face. That expression of Divine love is sweeter to them than any delight. Israel has been assured by Him that He will again appear to them to explain the secrets and hidden meanings of the Torah. They beseech Him to fulfill His promise and thus they exclaim, “Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth.”</i> for your love is dearer than wine.
Like the fragrance of good oils, your name is like flowing oil;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">When fragrant oil is poured, its pleasing aroma is diffused for all to enjoy.—Rashi</i> therefore young maidens love you.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">“Young maidens” refers to the nations of the world.—Rashi</i>
Draw me, we will run after you; the king has brought me into his chambers, we will be glad and rejoice in you, we recall your love more than wine, they love you sincerely.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Israel recalls their love of God in their youth; their following Him through the desert without preparing provisions for themselves. He brought them “into His chambers” is a reference to the Clouds of Glory that hovered over them in the wilderness.—Rashi</i>
I am black, but comely,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Israel declares to the nations of the world, “I am black because of my sinful deeds but I am comely by virtue of the good deeds of my forefathers.—Rashi</i> daughters of Jerusalem; like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Shlomo.
Do not look upon me [with contempt] that I am so black, for the sun has tanned me; my mother's sons were incensed against me, they made me keeper of the vineyards, [but] my own vineyard I did not watch.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">They enticed me into idol-worship, thus I became blackened. They forced me to guard their vineyards, [their evil ways] and the vineyard which was my heritage from my ancestors, I did not guard.—Rashi</i>
Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where do you graze your flock where do you rest your flock at noon; for why should I flit about around the flocks of your companions?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Israel says before Him, “Where will You pasture Your sheep [Israel] among these wolves [the nations] in whose midst they are?” “And where will You give them respite in this exile which is a time of distress. Noon is a time of distress for sheep because the sun is most intense and there is no relief from the heat.—Rashi</i>
If you do not know [you who are the] fairest of women; go forth in the footsteps of the sheep and pasture your kids near the dwellings of the shepherds.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">God speaks to Israel and tells them to reflect upon the ways of their forefathers and walk in their ways. In that manner they will be saved from the hand of their oppressors. “Shepherds” refers to the leaders of Israel, the Shepherds of God’s holy flock.</i>
To steeds in the chariots of Pharaoh I have likened you, my beloved.
Your cheeks are comely with rows of gems your neck with [pearl] necklaces.
Circlets of gold we will make for you with spangles of silver.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> These verses recall the great wealth Israel salvaged from the בִּיזַת הַיָם , the booty of the Reed Sea, after the Egyptians were drowned.</i>
While the king was at his table, my spikenard gave out its fragrance.
A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, between my breasts he shall lie.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Israel betrayed God by sinning with the “golden calf,” He commanded them to build the Tabernacle so that He would dwell among them. The most sacred place in the Tabernacle was the Ark and the Divine Presence rested בֵּין שְׁנֵי בַדֵי הָאָרוֹן , between the two staves of the Ark which protruded through the Curtain like the breasts of a woman.— Rashi </i>
A cluster of henna is my beloved to me in the vineyards of En-gedi.
Behold you are beautiful, my beloved, behold you are beautiful; your eyes are like doves.
You are handsome, my beloved, most handsome;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Israel was told that she was beautiful and is praised for her work in building the Tabernacle; but she says that the beauty is not hers, but God’s for he overlooked their iniquities and caused His Presence to reside in their midst.—Rashi</i> indeed our bed is fresh.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence as well as the next refers to the מִשְׁכָּן , the Tabernacle.</i>
The beams of our houses are cedars, our panels are cypresses.

Chapter 2

I am a rose of Sharon a rose of the valleys.
As a rose among the thorns, so is my beloved among the daughters.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the rose retains its beauty and redness although pricked by surrounding thorns, so does My people Israel maintain her faith despite the attempt of the nations to entice her to follow their strange gods.—Rashi</i>
As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the sons; in its shade I delighted and sat, and its fruit was sweet to my palate.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The apple tree is shunned by all people when the sun is overhead because it provides no shade. So all the nations fled from the Almighty on the day of the giving of the Torah. But I, Israel, delighted and sat in His “shadow.”—Rashi</i>
He brought me to the banqueting-house,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The אהֶל מוֹעֵד , Tent of the Tabernacle where the details and explanations of the Torah were expounded.— Rashi </i> and his banner is raised over me in love.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine Presence, God’s banner, dwelt among Israel demonstrating His profound love for us to all the nations.—Metsudas Dovid</i>
Sustain me with dainty cakes refresh my bed with [the scent of] apples; for I am lovesick.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash remarks that אַשִׁישׁוּת allude to the Halachos and תַּפּוּחִים to the Haggados which are fragrant like apples. According to Rashi, Israel declares, “I am sick for want of His Divine love because I thirst for Him here in exile.”</i>
His left hand was under my head and his right would embrace me.
I bind you under oath, daughters of Jerusalem by the gazelles and the does of the field; that you do not cause hatred nor disturb this love while it still pleases.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi and others explain this verse as Israel adjuring her neighbors not to seize the opportunity of her sinful periods to provoke her to further sin and cause God to discard her. She declares that despite her sins, God’s love is ingrained within her and He still desires her above all nations.</i>
The voice of my beloved! Behold he comes; leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">According to Metsudas Dovid, Israel voices her faith that the ultimate redemption will come speedily and that God’s Divine love for her will be completely restored.</i>
My beloved resembles a gazelle or a young hart; behold, he stands behind our wall, observing through the windows peering through the lattices.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> Rashi interprets this verse as referring to the exodus from Egypt. Israel declares: “I thought I would be an  עֲגוּנָה (a woman bereft of her husband while still legally bound to him) for many more days. Then suddenly—behold, He made it known that He was peering through the windows of heaven taking notice of my suffering, as it said [Exodus 3:7] “I have truly seen the affliction of My people.”</i>
My beloved spoke and said to me, “Rise up, my beloved, my fair one, and go forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">God said to me through Moshe: “Rise up, אַעֲלֶה אֶתְכֶם מֵעָנִי מִצְרַיִם , I will bring you up and take you away from the affliction of Egypt.”— Rashi </i>
For behold, the winter is past, the rain is over, and gone.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The days of bondage and slavery are over.—Metsudas David</i>
The blossoms have appeared on the land, the time of singing has come; and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"> Rashi interprets blossoms as a reference to Moshe and Aharon who have appeared to care for your needs, and the time has come when you are destined to sing a song praising God for splitting the Reed Sea. The voice of the great guide, תַּיָר [Moshe], is heard when he issues directives to the people.</i>
The fig tree has produced its green figs, and the grapevines tender grapes give out their fragrance; arise my beloved, my fair one, and go forth.
My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the concealment of the cliff,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi explains that this verse refers to the time when Pharaoh was pursuing the Jews and found them encamped at the sea. They were trapped—with the sea before them and the Egyptians behind them. They resembled a dove fleeing from a hawk. It flew into the cleft of a rock and found a snake lurking there. It could not enter because of the snake nor turn back because of the hawk.</i> show me your countenance, let me hear your voice;<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Show me the quality of your deeds—to whom do you turn in time of distress; let Me hear your voice in prayer as it is said, וַיִצְעַקוּ בְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל , and the Children of Israel cried out [prayed] to God.— Rashi </i> for your voice is sweet and your countenance is comely.
Seize for us the foxes, little foxes that destroy vineyards [for] our vineyards are with tender grapes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The foxes refer to the Egyptians who sought to destroy Israel [God’s vineyard] in its early formative stage.—Rashi</i>
My beloved is mine, and I am his, who pastures among the roses.
Until the sun spreads and the shadows flee; you turned away, my beloved, and became like a gazelle or a young hart on distant mountains.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi, Israel’s sin of the golden calf destroyed the intimacy of God’s relationship with her and caused Him to swiftly depart from her and He became distant, far removed from her.</i>

Chapter 3

On my bed at night, I sought him whom my soul loves;<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">During the long nights of exile, Israel seeks its former open, uninhibited relationship with God.—Alshich</i> I sought him but did not find him.
I will rise now and roam through the city, in the market places and in the streets, I will seek him whom my soul loves;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is determined not to sleep through the night of exile, but actively searches out every possible avenue of rapprochement with God.—Alshich</i> I sought him but did not find him.
The watchmen found me those who circle about the city;<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi says that the ‘watchmen’ refers to Moshe and Aharon who guarded Israel from sin during the Egyptian exile.

Have you been assured of His deliverance?—Rashi</i>
Scarcely had I departed from them, when I found him whom my soul loves;<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Shortly after the departure (the death) of Moshe and Aharon, at the end of forty years in the wilderness, Israel saw that God was still with them as he helped them conquer the thirty one kings in the days of Yehoshua.—Rashi</i> I grasped him and would not let him go until I brought him to my mother's house and to the chamber of her who conceived me.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Israel declares that she did not rest until she built the Tabernacle at Shiloh.—Rashi According to Alshich the verse refers to the First Temple, the dwelling place of the Shechinah, and the Second Temple which was a mere chamber compared to the Divine grandeur of the First Temple.</i>
I bind you under oath, daughters of Jerusalem by the gazelles and the does of the field; that you do not cause hatred nor disturb this love while it still pleases.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See note 18.</i>

Behold the bed of Shlomo,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the אהֶל מוֹעֵד , the Tabernacle, and אֲרוֹן הַקוֹדֶשׁ , the Holy Ark. This is in accordance with Rashi who interprets לִשְׁלוֹמוֹ as  מֶלֶךְ שֶׁהַשָׁלוֹם שֶׁלוֹ , the King to whom peace belongs. Thus, the bed of Shlomo refers to the resting place of the Divine Presence.</i> sixty mighty men are around it; of the mighty men of Israel.
All of them holding swords, skilled in battle;<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to those who are skilled in the  מִלְחַמְתּוֹ שֶׁל תּוֹרָה , the “warfare” of Torah learning.</i> each with his sword at his side for fear of the nights.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">They are always on guard lest the Torah be forgotten and troubles befall them.—Rashi</i>

Chapter 5

I have come to my garden,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">When the Tabernacle was completed, “the glory of Adonoy filled the Tabernacle.” [See Midrash to Numbers 13:2]—Rashi</i> my sister, O bride, I have gathered my myrrh with my spice,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the incense offered at the dedication of the Tabernacle.

I arose to open for my beloved; and my hands dripped myrrh, and my fingers flowed with myrrh from the handles of the lock.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Israel reacts to God’s admonition.

Mincha Service for Erev Shabbos

Psalm 107

Give thanks to Adonoy, for He is good,
for His kindness endures forever.
Let those redeemed by Adonoy say it,
those He redeemed
from the adversary's hand.
And from the lands He gathered them,
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the south.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Targum paraphrases: the southern sea.</i>
They wandered in the wilderness,
in a path of desolation;
an inhabited city they did not find.
Hungry, also thirsty
their soul fainted within them.
Then they cried out to Adonoy
in their distress;
from their anguish He rescued them.
And He led them in a straight path,
that they might go to an inhabited city.
Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness,
and for His wonders to the children of man.
For He satisfied the longing soul,
and the hungry soul He filled with good.
Those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death,
bound in affliction and iron.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to those who are shackled and chained and locked in the darkness of dungeons or prisons.</i>
For they defied the words of the Almighty,
and the counsel of the Most High
they scorned.
And He humbled their heart with hard labor,
they stumbled and there was none to help.
Then they cried out to Adonoy
in their distress;
from their anguish He delivered them.
He brought them out from darkness
and from the shadow of death,
and their shackles He broke.
Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness,
and for His wonders to the children of man.
For He has broken the gates of bronze,
and the bars of iron He has cut asunder.
They are fools—
because of the way of their transgression
and their iniquities,
they cause their own affliction.
Their soul abhors all food,
and they drew near to the gates of death.
Then they cried out to Adonoy
in their distress;
from their anguish He delivered them.
He sends His word and heals them,
and delivers them from their destruction.
Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness,
and for His wonders to the children of man.
And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
and declare His works with singing.
Those who go down to the sea in ships,
that do work in mighty waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Bodies of water with swift currents require increased efforts to keep the ship on course.</i>
They saw the works of Adonoy,
and His wonders in the deep.
He spoke and raised the stormwind,
and lifted up its waves.
They rise to the heavens,
they descend to the depths,
their soul melts away because of trouble.
They reel and stagger like a drunkard,
and all their skills are swallowed up [useless].
Then they cried out to Adonoy
in their distress,
from their anguish He rescued them.
He turned the storm into calmness,
and their waves were stilled.
They rejoiced
because the waves were quieted,
and He led them to their desired border.
Let them thank Adonoy for His kindness,
and for His wonders to the children of man.
Let them exalt Him
in an assembly of people,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From this verse, the Talmud learns the Blessing of Thanksgiving (בִּרְכַת הַגוֹמֵל) must be recited in the presence of ten men who constitute a קָהָל , an assembly. —[ Berachos 54b ]</i>
and at a sitting of elders, praise Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">From these words the Talmud learns that at least two of the ten men in the quorum, must be elders, Torah scholars.</i>
He turns rivers into a wilderness,
and springs of water into an arid place.
A fruitful land into a salt waste,
because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
He turns a wilderness into a pool of water,
and a dry land into springs of water.
And He made the hungry settle there,
and they established an inhabited city.
And they sowed fields and planted vineyards,
which yielded fruit for harvest.
And He blessed them
and they multiplied greatly,
and their cattle, He did not diminish.
And they were reduced in numbers
and brought low,
from oppression, calamity, and sorrow.
He pours contempt upon nobles,
and causes them to wander in the wasteland
where there is no path.
And He lifted up the needy from affliction,
and he established families like a flock.
The upright will see it and rejoice,
and all iniquity will shut its mouth.
Whoever is wise, let him note these things,
and they will understand
the kindnesses of Adonoy.

Yedid Nefesh

Beloved of the soul, merciful Father,
draw Your servant to Your will.
[Then] Your servant will run like a deer;

by showing her
the pleasantness of Your radiance.

and she will have everlasting joy.

<small>(On Chanukah and Purim the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, “ וְעַל כֻּלָּם , and for all the foregoing.”)</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles
for the redemption, for the mighty deeds,
for the deliverances, for the wonders
for the consolations and for the wars
that You performed for our fathers
in those days at this season.
<small>On Chanukah:</small>
In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons,
when the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
<small>On Purim:</small>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther
in Shushan the Capital [of Persia],
when the evil Haman rose up against them,
he sought to destroy, to kill,
and to annihilate all the Jews,
young and old, infants and women,
in one day, the thirteenth day
of the twelfth month,
which is the month of Adar,
and to plunder their wealth—
And You, in Your abundant mercy,
annulled his counsel,
frustrated his intention,
and brought his evil plan upon his own head,
and they hanged him and his sons
upon the gallows.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly, forever and ever.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</small>
Inscribe for a good life
all the children of Your covenant.
<small>If you forgot to say this, see page 000.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever
and praise and bless
Your great Name with sincerity forever;
for You are goodness—
the Almighty, Who is our deliverance
and our help forever—
the benevolent Almighty.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
“The Beneficent” is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.
<small>Birkas Kohanim is said by the Chazzan on public fast-days:</small>
<b>Birkas Kohanim</b>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us
with the threefold blessing of the Torah,
written by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
pronounced from the mouth of Aaron
and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people;
as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.
<small>After Birkas Kohanim the congregation says:</small>
Mighty One on high who dwells in might,
You are peace and Your Name is peace.
May it be Your will that You grant us
and all of Your people, the House of Israel
life and blessing
for a safeguard to peace.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing,
life favor, kindness and compassion
upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one
with the light of Your countenance.
For by the light of Your countenance
You gave us Adonoy our God,
a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,
righteousness, blessing, compassion,
life, and peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace
(with much strength and peace).
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</small>
In the book of life, blessing, peace
and abundant maintenance,
good decrees, salvations and condolences,
may we be remembered and inscribed
before You;
we and all Your people, the House of Israel
for a good life and peace.
<small>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil
and my lips from speaking deceitfully.
To those who curse me,
may my soul be unresponsive;
and let my soul be like dust to all.
Open my heart to Your Torah
and let my soul pursue Your commandments.
And all who plan evil against me,
quickly annul their counsel
and frustrate their intention.
(May it it be Your will
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that no person be envious of me
and that I not be envious of others,
that I not be brought to anger this day,
and that I not cause Your anger;
and save me from the evil inclination,
and help me be humble and any modest.
Our King and our Father,
unify Your Name in Your world,
rebuild Your city, establish Your house
and perfect your sanctuary.
Gather our exiles,
redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name.
Act for the sake of Your right hand.
Act for the sake of Your Torah.
Act for the sake of Your holiness.
In order that Your loved ones be released,
deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
<small>Biblical phrases applicable to one's name may be found on pp. 000-000.</small>
May they be acceptable—
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart—before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace
in His high heavens
may He make peace
upon us and upon all Israel
and say Amein.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days,
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.
And let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
as in the days of old and in earlier years.
<small>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime

praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance

He Who makes peace

Aleinu

It is our obligation to praise
the Master of all,
to ascribe greatness
to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning:
that He has not made us
like the nations of the lands,
and has not positioned us
like the families of the earth;
that He has not assigned
our portion like theirs,
nor our lot like that of all their multitudes.
For they prostrate themselves
to vanity and nothingness,
and pray to a god that cannot deliver.
But we bow, prostrate ourselves,
and offer thanks
before the Supreme King of Kings,
the Holy One blessed is He,
Who spreads the heavens,
and establishes the earth,
and the seat of His glory is in heaven above,
and the abode of His invincible might
is in the loftiest heights.
He is our God, there is nothing else.
Our King is true,
all else is insignificant,
as it is written in His Torah:
“And You shall know this day
and take into Your heart
that Adonoy is God
in the heavens above
and upon the earth below;
there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You,
Adonoy our God,
to soon behold the glory of Your might
in banishing idolatry from the earth,
and the false gods will be utterly exterminated
to perfect the world
as the kingdom of Shadai.
And all mankind will invoke Your Name,
to turn back to You,
all the wicked of the earth.
They will realize and know,
all the inhabitants of the world,
that to You, every knee must bend,
every tongue must swear [allegiance to You].
Before You, Adonoy, our God,
they will bow and prostrate themselves,
and to the glory of Your Name give honor.
And they will all accept [upon themselves]
the yoke of Your kingdom,
and You will reign over them, soon,
forever and ever.
For the kingdom is Yours,
and to all eternity You will reign in glory,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“Adonoy will reign forever and ever.”
And it is said:
“And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.”
Do not fear sudden terror
nor the destruction of the wicked
when it comes.
Take counsel together and it will be foiled
speak the word and it will not stand
for God is with us.
To your old age I am [with you],
to your older years I will sustain you,
I have made you, and I will carry you,
I will sustain you and save you.

Mourner's Kaddish

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and good life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace
(<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> the peace)
in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
and say, Amen.
<small>The following is recited here by some congregations from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres. Others recite it at the end of the Maariv (Evening) Service.</small>
By David:
Adonoy is my light and my salvation,
whom shall I fear?
Adonoy is the strength of my life,
of whom shall I be afraid?
When evildoers approach me
to devour my flesh—
my tormentors and my foes
they stumble and fall.
If an army should encamp against me,
my heart would not fear;
if war were to rise against me,
in this I trust.
One thing I request of Adonoy,
[only] that shall I seek,
that I may dwell in the House of Adonoy
all the days of my life,
to behold the pleasantness of Adonoy,
and to meditate in His Sanctuary.
For He will hide me in His Tabernacle
on the day of distress,
He will conceal me in the shelter of His Tent,
upon a rock He will lift me.
And now my head is raised high
above my enemies around me;
and I will offer in His Tent,
sacrifices accompanied by trumpets of joy;
I will sing and chant to Adonoy.
Adonoy, hear my voice when I call;
be gracious to me and answer me.
Of You, my heart has said,
“Seek My Presence”;
Your Presence, Adonoy I will seek.
Conceal not Your Presence from me,
do not turn away Your servant in anger.
You have been my help;
neither cast me off nor abandon me,
God of my deliverance.
When my father and mother abandon me,
Adonoy will gather me up.
Adonoy, teach me Your way,
and lead me in the path of uprightness,
because of my watchers.
Do not deliver me
to the will of my tormentors,
for false witnesses have risen against me,
who breathe violence.
Had I not believed that I would see
the goodness of Adonoy
in the land of living.
Hope to Adonoy,
be strong and He will give you courage;
and hope to Adonoy.

The field and all that is in it will jubilate,
then
all the trees of the forest will sing for joy.
Before Adonoy when He comes—
when He comes to judge the earth;
He will judge mankind with justice,
and peoples with His truth.

Psalm 97

When Adonoy
is [universally accepted as] King<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages say that this will occur after the annihilation of Amalek. At that time God’s Name and His throne will be complete. See Exodus 10.</i>
the earth will exult;
the multitudes of islands<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Those who live on these islands will rejoice.—Etz Yosef</i> will rejoice.
Clouds and dense darkness surround Him;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">These clouds and darkness will envelop and destroy the wicked, after which God’s justice and righteousness will be apparent. Others say that this is an allusion to the mystery of God’s ways, but that His kingdom is founded on righteousness.—Radak</i>
righteousness and justice
are the foundations of His throne.
Fire will go before Him

His lightning illuminates
the inhabited world,
the earth sees and trembles.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The future revelation of God’s kingdom is described in terms similar to those of the revelation at Mount Sinai.</i>
The mountains<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">‘Mountains’ refers to the kings of the world—Etz Yosef</i> melt like wax
before Adonoy,
before the Master of all the earth.
The heavens will declare His righteousness
and all the peoples will behold His glory.
Humiliated will be
all who serve graven images,
who are proud of idols;
before Him all gods will bow.
Zion will hear and rejoice,
and the daughters [cities] of Judah will exult
because of Your judgments, Adonoy.

over all the earth;
You are greatly exalted above all gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Yosef understands ‘gods’ to refer to the sun, moon, stars, etc.</i>
Lovers of Adonoy, hate evil!
He preserves the souls of His pious ones;
from the hand of the wicked, He saves them.
Light is sown<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Light is sown for the righteous in this world but the harvest of that light awaits the future world.—Radak Others say that the light may be hidden like the seed in the earth, but it is sure to spring forth.</i> for the righteous,

Psalm 98

A Psalm.
Sing to Adonoy, a new song<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This Psalm, like the previous ones, refers to the future when God will render final judgment on the world and its inhabitants.</i>

burst forth into exultation,
sing, and play music!
Play to Adonoy with a harp,
with harp and the sound of music.
With trumpets and the sound of the <i>shofar</i>
raise your voices before the King, Adonoy.
The sea and its fullness, will roar with joy!
[also] the world
and those who dwell therein.
Rivers will clap hands,
together, mountains will sing.
Before Adonoy
when He comes to judge the earth;
He will judge mankind with righteousness
and peoples with uprightness.

Psalm 99

When Adonoy is [universally accepted as]
King,
peoples will tremble;<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Radak notes that Psalm 97 states that, ‘When Adonoy is (universally accepted as) King, the earth will exult.’ He explains that the people will tremble during the destruction of Gog of Magog, and only after his downfall will the earth rejoice.</i>

Lecha Dodi

<small> This poem was written by Rabbi Solomon Halevy Alkabetz, whose name שְׁלֹמֹה הַלֵוִי is spelled out by the first letter of each stanza.</small>
<small>In this poem, the bridegroom (Israel) calls to his Beloved Friend (God) asking that He join him in welcoming his bride (the Sabbath).</small>
<small>The concept of welcoming the Sabbath goes back to Talmudic times. Rabbi Chanina robed himself and stood at sunset on the eve of the Sabbath and exclaimed, “Come! Let us go forth to welcome the Sabbath Queen.” Rabbi Yanai garbed himself in festive attire on Sabbath eve and exclaimed; “Come bride, Come bride” (<i>Shabbos</i> 119a).</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
“Preserve” and “Remember”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">“Preserve” and “Remember” refers to the discrepancy between the two texts of the fourth commandment. Exodus (20:8) reads, “Remember the Sabbath day,” while Deuteronomy (5:12) reads, “Preserve the Sabbath day.” The Talmud (Shavuos 20b) explains that both words, שָׁמוֹר and זָכוֹר were miraculously pronounced by God simultaneously.</i>
in a single utterance
the One Almighty caused us to hear;
Adonoy is One, and His Name is One;
for fame, for glory, and for praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">These words revert back to the first lines of this stanza: “The One Almighty God caused us to hear for our fame, for our glory, and for our praise.” This thought is based on the verse in Deuteronomy 28:18,19, “Keep the commandments, and He will make you high above all nations—in praise, in name, and in glory.”—Iyun Tefilah</i>
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
To greet the Sabbath, come let us go
for it is the source of blessing;
from the very beginning, of old,
it was appointed;
last in creation, first in [God's] thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is based on the Midrashic illustration of the architect who prepares the plans for the entire structure before beginning the construction. Analogously, the Sabbath is the end-purpose of God’s creation, for which everything else was made.</i>
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
<small>On Yom Tov and Chol Hamoed skip to יָמִין וּשְׂמֹאל </small>
Sanctuary of the King, royal city,
arise, come forth from the upheaval;
too long have you dwelt
in the valley of weeping;
He will show you abundant pity.
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
Shake the dust off yourself, arise,
dress up in your garments of glory,
my people;
through the son of Yishai the Bethlehemite,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Messiah is a descendant of David, the son of Yishai of Bethlehem.</i>
draw near to my soul and redeem it.
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
Wake up! wake up!
for your light has come,
arise and shine.
Awaken! awaken! utter a song,
The glory of Adonoy is revealed upon you.
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
Feel not ashamed or humiliated
why are you bowed down,
why do you moan?
In you will take refuge
the poor of my people;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"> Others translate “The afflicted of my people will take refuge in you.”</i>
and the city will be rebuilt
on its ancient site.
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
They will be ravaged,
those who ravaged you,
and they will be cast far off,
all who devour you.
Your God will rejoice over you
as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride.
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
Right and left you will spread out.
and Adonoy, you will praise;<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows Iyun Tefilah. Others translate, “will you revere.”</i>
through the man descended from Peretz<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Peretz was the son of Judah from whom David was descended.</i>
we will rejoice and exult.
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.
<small>The chazzan and congregation turn to face the entrance while reciting this verse. While saying the words בּוֹאִי כַלָּה , Come Bride <i> bow and turn back, to signify that the Sabbath is entering.</i></small>
Come in peace, crown of her husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The husband is Israel; and the Sabbath is Israel’s crowning glory.</i>
come with song, (rejoicing)
and good cheer;
amidst the faithful of the treasured people.
Come Bride, come Bride,
come Bride, Shabbos Queen!
<small>Refrain:</small>
Come my Beloved Friend to greet the bride,
let us welcome the Sabbath.

Psalm 92

A Psalm, a song for the Shabbos day.
It is good to thank<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to God. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve God and to praise Him.—Radak</i> Adonoy,
and sing praise to Your Name, Most High.
To relate Your kindliness in the morning,
and Your faithfulness in the nights.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption. And while yet in the darkness of exile we proclaim our belief in His faithfulness.—Rashi</i>
Upon a ten-stringed instrument and lute,
in meditation upon the harp.
For You have given me joy, Adonoy,
with Your deeds,
at the work of Your hands<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath day of rest affords me the opportunity to observe and appreciate the greatness of Your work.—Radak</i> I sing joyously.
How great are Your works, Adonoy;
how infinitely profound are Your thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">God’s ‘works’ are the visible creation, while His ‘thoughts’ are the Divine purpose behind each created thing.—Seporno</i>
An empty-headed man cannot know,
nor does a fool understand this:
When the wicked bloom like grass,
and all the evildoers blossom—
it is so that they may be destroyed forever.
But You will remain on high forever
Adonoy.
For behold, Your enemies, Adonoy;
For behold, Your enemies shall perish;
dispersed shall be all evildoers.
You uplifted my horn<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate, ‘You have increased my might like that of the wild ram.’</i> like that of a unicorn;
I am saturated with fresh oil.
My eye has seen [the defeat of]
those who spy on me;
of the wicked who rise against me,
my ears have heard [that they are doomed].
The righteous will blossom like a date palm,
like a cedar<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The palm and the cedar both enjoy a long life span and flourish during all seasons. Thus they symbolize the lasting happiness of the righteous in contrast to the short prosperity of the wicked.</i> in Lebanon, he will grow tall.
Planted in the House of Adonoy,
in the courtyards of our God
they will blossom.
They will still be fruitful in old age;
they will be full of sap and freshness.
To declare that Adonoy is upright;
He is my Stronghold;
in Whom there is no injustice.

Psalm 93

Adonoy had begun His reign
He has clothed Himself with majesty;<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">On the sixth day, the Levites sang Psalm 93, ‘Adonoy is King, He has clothed Himself in majesty,’ because He completed the work of creating and reigned over all His creatures.—Rosh Hashana 31a</i>
Adonoy has clothed Himself,
He has girded Himself with strength.
He has firmly established the world
so that it cannot be moved.
Your throne stands firm from of old,
You are from eternity.
The rivers have raised—Adonoy—
the rivers have raised their voice,
the rivers raise their raging waves.
More than the sound of many waters,
mightier than the breakers of the sea
Mighty on high, are You, Adonoy.
Your testimonies are extremely faithful,
holiness is becoming to Your House,
Adonoy—for the length of days.

<small>On Shabbos, before Borechu, the following selection from the Zohar is said.</small>


<small>When one is praying without a minyan, continue with the following:</small>

Maariv Service for Shabbos and Yom Tov

Borechu

<small>Unlike the morning <i>Shacharis</i> and afternoon <i>Mincha</i> services which correspond to the two daily communal sacrifices (<i>Tamid</i>), offered in the Temple, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, the evening <i>Maariv</i> service has no counterpart in the Temple service, since sacrifices were never brought at night in the Temple.</small>
<small>The <i>Maariv</i> service was instituted to correspond to the Temple ritual of keeping on the altar the unconsumed parts of sacrifices that had been offered earlier in the day. These parts were kept on the altar at night so that they could be completely consumed by its fire. This ritual was applicable only if there actually were unconsumed parts of offerings.</small>
<small>Although the <i>Maariv</i> service was instituted to correspond to this ritual, and may therefore seem to be non-obligatory (see <i>Maseches Berachos</i> 27b), Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi and all the other codifiers have ruled that <i>Maariv</i> has been accepted and hallowed by custom, and is therefore an obligatory service.</small>
<small>The <i>Shema</i> is preceded by two blessings and followed by two other blessings.</small>
<small>The Chazzan <i>says:</i></small>
Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</small>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed
forever and ever.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe,
With His word He brings on evenings,
with wisdom He opens the gates<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These are the gates of sunrise and sunset through which God, in His infinite wisdom, has divided life on earth into two complementary halves.—Rabbi S.R. Hirsch</i> (of heaven);
and with understanding changes<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He alternates the three daily periods—evening, morning, and afternoon.—Avudraham</i> the times
and alternates the seasons,
and arranges the stars
in their watches,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The stars appear as watchmen appointed by God to stand guard over the sleeping world below. He also appointed them their places in definite orbits according to His will and for purposes known to Him alone.—S.R. Hirsch</i> in the sky,
according to His will.
He creates day and night,
He rolls the light away from before darkness,
and darkness from before light;
He causes day to pass
and brings night,
and separates between day and night;
Adonoy of Hosts<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">His Name ה' צְבָאוֹת means “He Who takes all the infinite variety of hosts and creatures and unites them to act and interact as parts of one unified Universe.”— S.R. Hirsch </i> is His Name.

It declares that Torah alone is the eternal heritage of the Jewish people and that all other goods and gifts of life are transitory.— S.R. Hirsch </i>
You loved the House of Israel, Your people.
Torah and commandments,
statutes and laws,
You taught us.
Therefore, Adonoy, our God,
when we lie down and when we rise,
we will discuss Your statutes,
and rejoice
in the words of the teachings of Your Torah
and in Your commandments forever.
For they are our life
and they lengthen our days,
and on them we will meditate day and night.
[May] Your love
never be removed from us
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who loves His people Israel.
<small>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
Hear, Israel:
Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
<small>The following three lines are to be said silently:</small>
Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.
And you shall love Adonoy your God
with all your heart
and with all your soul
and with all your possessions.
And these words
which I command you today,
shall be upon your heart.
And you shall teach them sharply
to your children.
And you shall discuss them
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall bind them for a sign
upon your hand,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.
And it will be—
if you vigilantly obey My commandments
which I command you this day,
to love Adonoy your God,
and serve Him
with your entire hearts
and with your entire souls—
that I will give rain for your land
in its proper time,
the early (autumn) rain
and the late (spring) rain;
and you will harvest your grain
and your wine and your oil.
And I will put grass
in your fields for your cattle,
and you will eat and be satisfied.
Beware lest your hearts be swayed
and you turn astray,
and you worship alien gods
and bow to them.
And Adonoy's fury will blaze among you,
and He will close off the heavens
and there will be no rain
and the earth will not yield its produce;
and you will perish swiftly
from the good land
which Adonoy gives you.
Place these words of Mine
upon your hearts and upon your souls,—
and bind them for a sign
upon your hands,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.
And you shall teach them to your sons,
to speak them
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.
In order that your days be prolonged,
and the days of your children,
upon the land
which Adonoy swore to your fathers
to give them [for as long]
as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying:
Speak to the children of Israel,
and tell them
to make for themselves fringes
on the corners of their garments
throughout their generations;
and they will place with the fringes
of each corner
a thread of blue.
And it will be to you for fringes,
and you will look upon it
and you will remember
all the commandments of Adonoy,
and you will perform them;
and you will not turn aside after your hearts
and after your eyes
which cause you to go astray.
In order that you will remember
and perform all My commandments;
and you will be holy unto your God.
I am Adonoy, your God,
Who brought you out
of the land of Egypt
to be your God:
I am Adonoy, your God—
<small> You must be careful to connect the last words of Shema, ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם (Adonoy, your God), with the word אֶמֶת (is true) without pause or interruption so that these three words form one sentence, meaning “Adonoy your God is true” (Maseches Berachos 13a).</small>
—is true—
<small>The chazan repeats:</small>
Adonoy, your God, is true.
—and faithful is all this,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">All that we have affirmed in the Shema, is true and trustworthy.—Etz Yosef</i>
and it is permanently established with us
that he is Adonoy, our God,
and there is nothing besides Him,
and that we, Israel, are His people.

and brings retribution
on all those who are enemies of our soul.
He does great things<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Great things” refers to the way God rules according to the laws of nature and “wonders” refers to those things that are classified as miracles.—Siach Yitzchak</i>

<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
Be pleased, Adonoy, our God,
with Your people Israel
and pay heed to their prayer;
and restore the service
to the Holy of Holies in Your abode,
and the fire-offerings of Israel;
and accept their prayer, lovingly
and willingly.
And may You always find pleasure
with the service of Your people, Israel.
<small>On a regular Shabbos continue, “And may our eyes,” on p. 000.</small>
<small>On Rosh Chodesh and on Chol HaMoed, the following prayer is added:</small>
Our God and God of our fathers,
may there ascend, come, and reach,
appear, be desired, and heard,
counted and recalled
our remembrance and reckoning;
the remembrance of our fathers;
the remembrance of the Mashiach
the son of David, Your servant;
the remembrance of Jerusalem,

for survival, for well-being,
for favor, kindliness, compassion,
for good life and peace

Rosh Chodesh
the <i>Festival of Matzos</i>
the <i>Festival of Sukkos</i>
Remember us Adonoy, our God,
on this day for well-being;
be mindful of us on this day for blessing,
and deliver us for good life.
In accord with the promise of deliverance
and compassion,
spare us and favor us,
have compassion on us and deliver us;
for to You our eyes are directed
because You are the Almighty
Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
<small>If you forgot to say this, see page 000.</small>
And may our eyes behold
Your merciful return to Zion.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
<small>At the words, We are thankful, <i>bend forward; at </i>Adonoy <i>return to an upright position.</i></small>
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
We are thankful to You
that You Adonoy are our God
and the God of our fathers forever;
Our Rock, Rock of our lives,
the Shield of our deliverance,
You are in every generation.
We will give thanks to You
and recount Your praise,

(You are) The Beneficent One—
for Your compassion is never withheld;
And (You are) the Merciful One—
for Your kindliness never ceases;
for we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(On Shabbos Chanukah the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, “ וְעַל כֻּלָּם , and for all the foregoing.”)</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles
for the redemption, for the mighty deeds,
for the deliverances, for the wonders
for the consolations and for the wars
that You performed for our fathers
in those days at this season.
In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons,
when the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly, forever and ever.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</small>
Inscribe for a good life
all the children of Your covenant.
<small>If you forget to say this, see page 000.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever
and praise and bless
Your great Name with sincerity forever;
for You are goodness—
the Almighty, Who is our deliverance
and our help forever—
the benevolent Almighty.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
“The Beneficent” is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.

<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing,

upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one

You gave us Adonoy our God,

Aleinu

It is our obligation to praise
the Master of all,
to ascribe greatness
to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning:
that He has not made us
like the nations of the lands,
and has not positioned us
like the families of the earth;
that He has not assigned
our portion like theirs,
nor our lot like that of all their multitudes.
For they prostrate themselves
to vanity and nothingness,
and pray to a god that cannot deliver.
But we bow, prostrate ourselves,
and offer thanks
before the Supreme King of Kings,
the Holy One blessed is He,
Who spreads the heavens,
and establishes the earth,
and the seat of His glory is in heaven above,
and the abode of His invincible might
is in the loftiest heights.
He is our God, there is nothing else.
Our King is true,
all else is insignificant,
as it is written in His Torah:
“And You shall know this day
and take into Your heart
that Adonoy is God
in the heavens above
and upon the earth below;
there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You,
Adonoy our God,
to soon behold the glory of Your might
in banishing idolatry from the earth,
and the false gods
will be utterly exterminated
to perfect the world
as the kingdom of Shadai.
And all mankind will invoke Your Name,
to turn back to You,
all the wicked of the earth.
They will realize and know,
all the inhabitants of the world,
that to You, every knee must bend,
every tongue must swear [allegiance to You].
Before You, Adonoy, our God,
they will bow and prostrate themselves,
and to the glory of Your Name give honor.
And they will all accept [upon themselves]
the yoke of Your kingdom,
and You will reign over them, soon,
forever and ever.
For the kingdom is Yours,
and to all eternity You will reign in glory,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“Adonoy will reign forever and ever.”
And it is said:
“And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.”
Do not fear sudden terror
nor the destruction of the wicked
when it comes.
Take counsel together and it will be foiled
speak the word and it will not stand
for God is with us.
To your old age I am [with you],
to your older years I will sustain you,
I have made you, and I will carry you,
I will sustain you and save you.

Mourner's Kaddish

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name

Order of Shabbos in the Home

Blessing the Children

<small>It has become a widely accepted custom for parents to bless their children on the eve of Shabbos.</small>
<small>The placing of both hands upon the child's head when giving the blessing, symbolizes that the blessing is bestowed with fullness of spirit and heart.</small>
<small>For a boy:</small>
May God make you
like Ephraim and Menashe.
May Adonoy bless you and guard you.
May Adonoy shine His countenance
upon you
and be gracious unto you.
May Adonoy turn His countenance
toward you
and grant you peace.
<small>For a girl:</small>
May God make you
like Sorah, Rivkah, Rochel and Leah.
May Adonoy bless you and guard you.
May Adonoy shine His countenance
upon you
and be gracious unto you.
May Adonoy turn His countenance
toward you
and grant you peace.

Sholom Aleichem

<small>Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Yehudah said: “Two angels accompany a man on the eve of Shabbos from the synagogue to his home, one good angel and one evil angel.” When the person arrives home to find the lights burning, the table set, and the bed made, the good angel exclaims, “May it be God's will that it be so next Shabbos.” But if not so, if the the house is dark and in disorder, the evil angel exclaims, “May it be God's will that it be so next Shabbos.” The good angel is compelled to answer Amein.—<i>Maseches Shabbos</i> 119b</small>
<small>The custom of singing <i>Sholom Aleichem</i>, peace upon you, upon returning from the synagogue is based on the above Talmudic teaching. Since every Jew is accompanied home by these two angels, it is fitting that he welcome them into his home. Obviously, one should prepare for Shabbos in such manner to evoke the angels' best wishes.</small>

Kiddush for Shabbos Eve

<small>The fourth of the Ten Commandments bids us “ זָכוֹר אֶת יוֹם הַשַׁבָּת לְקַדְשׁוֹ ”, Remember the Shabbos day, <i> Lekadsho</i> to keep it holy (<i> Exodus</i> 20:8). The word also implies <i> to sanctify it.</i> Jewish law therefore requires us to sanctify the Shabbos at its beginning—and at its conclusion—with an oral declaration. Thus we have the mitzvah of <i> Kiddush</i> upon the arrival of the Shabbos and <i> Havdala</i> at its conclusion.</small>
<small>Most halachic authorities agree that the Scriptural command to proclaim the sanctity of the Shabbos is fulfilled by reciting the middle blessing of the Friday night <i>Shemoneh Esreh.</i> The command to recite the <i>Kiddush</i> at home, over wine, is rabbinic.</small>
<small>In Babylonia it was customary to recite <i> Kiddush</i> over wine in the synagogue at the end of the Friday night service for the travelers who remained in the synagogue to eat and sleep. (<i> Pesachim</i> 101a, see <i> Tosofos</i> s.v.  דְאָכְלוּ)</small>
<small>In many synagogues in the diaspora it is still customary to recite this <i>Kiddush.</i> But in Eretz Yisroel, the custom was never instituted, and so to this day, <i>Kiddush</i> is not recited there on Friday night.</small>
<small>It is forbidden to eat on Friday night without first reciting <i>Kiddush,</i> to be followed <i>immediately</i> by the meal.</small>
<small>When <i>Kiddush</i> is said over wine, the <i>challa</i> loaves must be covered. When wine is not available on Friday night, it is permissible to recite <i>Kiddush</i> over two whole <i>challa</i> loaves; in such an instance, the <i>challa</i> need not be covered. When reciting <i>Kiddush</i> over bread, you must wash your hands and say the berachah <i>“Al netilas yodayim”</i> before reciting the <i>Kiddush.</i></small>
<small>Halachic opinions differ as to whether <i>Kiddush</i> should be said while standing or while seated at the table. Both practices are widespread and one should follow family tradition or the tradition of one's teachers in this matter.</small>
<small>Recite quietly:</small>
And evening came, then morning came:
<small>Recite aloud:</small>
the sixth day.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The words יוֹם הַשִּׁשִּׁי , the sixth day, are actually the last two words of the biblical verse that immediately precedes וַיְכֻלּוּ , which is the beginning of Kiddush. These two words are added as a preface to the actual Kiddush because the first letters of these two Hebrew words Y (yud) and H (heh) plus the first letters of the two words  וַיְכֻלּוּ הַשָּׁמַיִם , V (vov) and H (heh), form the Four Letter Name of God. Because these two words are part of a verse, the Sages incorporated the preceding words, וַיְהִי עֶרֶב וַיְהִי בקֶר and there was morning and there was evening, to form a complete sentence. These words however, are said quietly as they do not relate to the Kiddush. </i>
And the heavens and the earth were completed
and [so were] all their hosts.
And God completed, by the seventh day,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">God completed His work at the precise moment which marked the beginning of the seventh day, but nevertheless was not part of it. The Sages comment נִכְנַס בּוֹ כְּחוּט הַשַׂעֲרָה He entered into it (the seventh day) by a hairsbreadth.— Seporno </i>
His work which He had done;
and He abstained on the seventh day
from all His work which He had done.
And God blessed the seventh day
and sanctified it,
for on it He abstained
from all His work
which God had created to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">S.R. Hirsch translates “Which He, God, had brought into existence in order to continue the work of creation upon it.”</i>

Creator of the fruit of the vine.

With your permission!

<small>Each person should receive some wine from the Kiddush cup. Everybody then wash their hands and recite the berachah על נטילת ידים and the head of the household says the berachah for bread over two vhallohs,, and fivess a piecr of the challah to each preson.</small>

a land<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The land is mentioned even before the Exodus from Egypt because God demonstrated His extraordinary concern for the Jewish people at the very beginning of their history; first by the promise He gave to the Patriarchs concerning the Land of Israel and then, with the fulfillment of that promise, once He redeemed them from Egypt to enter the Land.—S.R. Hirsch</i> which is
desirable, good, and spacious;
for Your bringing us out, Adonoy, our God,

for Your covenant

for Your Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Torah” refers to laws which are comprehensible to the human intellect; it is therefore taught. “Statutes” (חֻקִים) are beyond human understanding and are therefore merely made known to man, for man cannot comprehend them.

[We thank You] for the miracles
for the redemption, for the mighty deeds,
for the deliverances, for the wonders
for the consolations and for the wars
that You performed for our fathers
in those days at this season.
In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons,
when the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
For everything Adonoy, our God,
We thank You
and bless You.
Blessed be Your Name
through the mouth of all the living,
constantly, forever, as it is written:
“When You have eaten and are satisfied,
You will bless Adonoy, your God,
for the good land
which He has given to you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 8:10</i>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
for the land and for the food.
Have compassion, Adonoy, our God,
on Israel, Your people,
on Jerusalem, Your city,
on Zion, the dwelling place of Your glory,
on the kingship of the house of David,
Your anointed;
and on the great and holy House
upon which Your Name is called.

speedily from all our troubles.
Adonoy, our God—may we never be in need

which is full, open,
holy and generous,
so that we may not be shamed
nor humiliated<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">May we not be “ashamed” in this world due to poverty and may we not be “humiliated” in the World-to-Come, because of our transgressions. Poverty often brings shame which in turn might cause a person to lose faith.—Etz Yosef</i>

<small>On Shabbos add:</small>
May it please You, to strengthen us
Adonoy, our God,

and through the commandment
of the seventh day,
this great and holy Sabbath.
For this day
is great and holy before You,
to refrain from work on it
and to rest on it with love,

And by Your will,
grant us repose Adonoy, our God,
that there be no distress, sorrow,
or sighing on the day of our rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Even though prayers for personal needs are not recited on Shabbos, this particular prayer does contain such a request, because it is so closely interwoven with the commandment to rest on Shabbos.

Show us Adonoy, our God,
the consolation of Zion, Your city,
and the rebuilding of Jerusalem,
city of Your Sanctuary,
for You are the Master of deliverance
and the Master of consolation.

Our God and God of our fathers,
may there ascend, come, and reach,
appear, be desired, and heard,
counted and recalled

<small>If you reminded yourself after you had already begun the fourth blessing and have said:  בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' , then you must repeat the entire Birkas Hamazon.

The Morning Prayers

Upon Arising in the Morning

I give thanks to You
living and everlasting King
for You have restored my soul with mercy.
Great is Your faithfulness.
<small>After washing your hands, say:</small>
The beginning of wisdom is fear of Adonoy,
good understanding
to all who perform [His commandments],
His praise endures forever.
Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.
<small>Before putting on your tallis katan say:</small>

<small>Before beginning the Morning Prayers you should say the following:</small>
I hereby accept upon myself
the positive commandment
to love my fellow Jew.
<small>The following verses from Scriptures are recited upon entering the synagogue, as though asking permission of God to enter and pray in His Holy place.</small>

Adon Olam

<small>This hymn has been attributed to R' Shlomo ibn Gabirol who lived in Spain during the eleventh century. While praising God's omnipotence and providence, it clarifies the meaning of the name Adonoy so that before proceeding to pray, each worshiper understands the significance of the God he is addressing.</small>
Master of the Universe Who reigned
before any creature was created.
At the time when all was made by His will,
then was His Name proclaimed King.
And after all things shall cease to be
the Awesome One will reign alone.
He was, He is,
and He shall be in glory.
He is One, and there is no second
to compare to Him, to associate [with Him].
Without beginning, without end,
power and dominion are His.
He is my God and my ever-living Redeemer,
the Rock of my destiny in times of distress.
He is my flag<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It is to Him that I rally and through Him that I am identified.—Etz Yosef</i> and my refuge;
He is the portion of my cup on the day I call.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He answers me.</i>
Into His hand I entrust my spirit
[both] when I sleep and when I awaken.
And with my spirit my body [too],
Adonoy is with me, I shall not fear.

Yigdal

<small>This hymn, written by Daniel ben Yehuda, who was a Dayan in Rome about 1300, is based on Maimonides' 13 principles of Judaism. According to Maimonides, failure to believe in a single one of these principles places one outside the pale of Judaism.</small>
<b>1) <i>The existence of God</i></b>
Exalted is the living God, and praised
He exists, and His existence transcends time.
<b>2) <i>God is One</i></b>
He is One, and there is no unity like His,
He is invisible, His unity is infinitive.
<b>3) <i>God is uncorporeal</i></b>
He is unlike the corporeal
or even the non-corporeal,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">God can also not be compared to the angels.</i>
His holiness is beyond comparison.
<b>4) <i>God is Eternal</i></b>
He preceded every being that was created,
He was First,
and there was no genesis to His beginning.
<b>5) <i>God alone must be worshipped</i></b>
He is Master of the Universe to every creature,
(all) proclaim His greatness and His majesty.
<b>6) <i>Truth of Divine Prophecy</i></b>
The fullness of His prophecy, He bestowed
on those He treasured,
and in whom He gloried.
<b>7) <i>Moses was the greatest of all prophets</i></b>
There never arose in Israel
another like Moses,
a prophet who beheld God's image.
<b>8) <i>Divine revelation of the Torah</i></b>
The Torah of truth
the Almighty gave to His people
through His prophet,
the trusted one of His house.
<b>9) <i>The Torah is immutable</i></b>
The Almighty will not exchange
nor alter His Law.
Never will He offer any alternative.
<b>10) <i>God knows the acts and thoughts of man</i></b>
He scrutinizes and knows our secrets.
He beholds the end of a thing at its beginning.
<b>11) <i>Divine reward and punishment</i></b>
He rewards man with kindness
according to his deeds.
He sends evil to the wicked
according to his wickedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The word deed is not applied to the wicked man. Since Divine reward and punishment are distributed with kindness, reward is granted to man not only for his deed which may itself be insignificant, but also for the long range effect of that deed. He is punished, however, only for his act of wickedness, not for the consequences of his deed.—Etz Yosef</i>
<b>12) <i>Belief in the coming of the Messiah</i></b>
He will send our Messiah at the end of days,
to redeem all who await His final deliverance.
<b>13) <i>Divine resurrection of the dead</i></b>
The Almighty will revive the dead
because of His abundant kindness:
Blessed forever is His praised Name.

Akeidah (The Binding of Isaac)

<small>Some omit the following paaragraphs on Shabbos and Yom Tov.</small>
Our God and God of our fathers,
remember us favorably before You
and be mindful of us for
deliverance and compassion
from the eternal high heavens.
Remember in our behalf, Adonoy, our God:
the love of our ancestors,
Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants;
the covenant, the kindness,
and the oath which You swore
to our father Abraham on Mount Moriah,
and the binding
of Isaac, his son
on the altar,
as it is written in Your Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 22:1-19:</i>
After these events,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">These events refer to the previous nine tests by which God tested Abraham. This was to be the tenth and the most difficult test of all.—Ha’amek Dovor</i>
God tested Abraham
and said to him, “Abraham!”
and he [Abraham] said, “Here I am.”
He said, “Please, take your son,
your only one,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was Abraham’s only son by Sarah.</i>
whom you love—Isaac—
and go to the land of Moriah,
and bring him up as a burnt-offering
on one of the mountains
which I will designate to you.
Abraham awoke early in the morning,
saddled his donkey,
and took his two attendants<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ishmael and Eliezer. Rashi</i> with him,
and also his son Isaac.
He split the wood of the burnt-offering,
and rose up, and went to the place
that God had designated to him.
On the third day,
Abraham lifted his eyes
and saw the place from afar.
Abraham said to his attendants,
“You stay here with the donkey,
and I and the boy will go to that place.
We will prostrate ourselves [in worship]
and return<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham prophesied that both of them would return.—Rashi</i> to you.”
And Abraham took
the wood of the burnt-offering
and placed it on his son Isaac.
In his hand he took
the fire and the knife,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word is “maacheles” (root: אכל = to eat) which means that it renders meat fit for eating through slaughtering the animal. Another interpretation is: his knife is called maacheles because we still enjoy (eat) the reward of Abraham’s virtue when he agreed to use it to slaughter his son.— Rashi </i>
and they both went together.
Isaac spoke to Abraham his father
and said, “Father,”
and he said, “Here I am my son.”
He said, “Here are the fire and the wood,
but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?”
Abraham said,
“God Himself will show the lamb
for a burnt offering, my son.”
And the two of them went together.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Although Isaac understood that he was going to be slaughtered, “They went together”—with like hearts.—Rashi</i>
They came to the place
that God had designated to him,
and Abraham built the<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah says that he built “the” altar not just “an” altar, to indicate that Abraham rebuilt the same altar which was originally built by Adam and used by Cain, Abel and by Noah.—Targum Yonoson ben Uziel</i> altar there,
and arranged the wood,
and bound his son Isaac,
and placed him on the altar,
on top of the wood.
Abraham reached out his hand
and took the knife
to slaughter his son.
An angel of Adonoy called to him
from heaven
and said, “Abraham! Abraham!”
and he said, “Here I am.”
He [God] said,
“Do not harm the boy,
nor do anything to him;
for now I know
that you are one who fears God
and have not withheld your son,
your only one, from Me.”
Abraham raised his eyes
and beheld a ram<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Tradition tells us that this ram was prepared for this purpose from the time of creation. Rashi (from Maseches Avos 5:6)</i>
after it had been caught in the thicket
by its horns;
and Abraham went and took the ram,
and brought it up as a burnt-offering
instead of his son.
Abraham called
the name of that place,
“Adonoy will see”;<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets the following: “God will see the binding of Isaac and through its merit He will pardon Israel every year and rescue them from trouble. It will thus be said, “On this day,” by all generations that the ashes of Isaac are seen by God and serve as our atonement.—Rashi</i>
as it is said [to] this day
“On Adonoy's mountain, He will be seen.”
An angel of Adonoy called to Abraham
a second time from heaven, and said,
“‘I have sworn by Myself,' declares Adonoy,
‘that because you performed
this deed,
and did not withhold
your only son,
I will greatly bless you
and make your descendants as numerous<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">If these blessings were intended to increase the population of Abraham’s descendants, it was superfluous, since God had previously blessed him for that purpose. God here blessed the descendants of Abraham with the nobility of spirit and courage to fulfill the command to sanctify God even when self-sacrifice is required. Only the nation of Israel, Abraham’s children, were commanded to fulfill this mitzvoh, because of the legacy we inherited from him.—Ha’amek Dovor.</i>
as the stars of the sky
and like the sand on the seashore,
and your descendants will inherit
the gate of their enemies.
Through your children, will be blessed
all the nations of the world,
because you heeded My voice.'”
Abraham returned to his attendants,
and they rose and went together
to Beer Sheva,
and Abraham dwelt in Beer Sheva.

Morning Supplications

A person should always be in fear of God,
privately as well as openly,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Some people conduct themselves in a God-fearing manner in the presence of others (in public), but in the privacy of their homes, do whatever they please. There are others who do just the opposite. In private they are governed by fear of God, but in the presence of others they are too embarrassed or intimidated to be God-fearing. A Jew must always fear God, in private as well as in public.—Si’ach Yitzchok</i>
[he should] admit the truth,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Acknowledging the truth is fundamental to serving God, and to all human behavior. One who is concerned merely with “winning the argument” will go to any extreme to come out on top. This attitude caused the downfall of the 250 leaders who joined Korach, rather than acknowledge the truth of Moses’ declaration (Numbers 16:2-35).—Si’ach Yitzchok</i>
and speak truth in his heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">It is not sufficient to merely acknowledge the truth verbally but one must speak truth in his heart as well. Rashi on the Talmud (Maseches Makos 24a) cites the following incident as an example of how one should speak truth in his heart: A buyer once offered to purchase an article from Rav Safra while he was reciting the Shema. Because he could not indicate his acceptance, the anxious purchaser increased his offer. Rav Safra refused the increment because in his heart he had already accepted the original offer.</i>
and rise early and proclaim:
Lord of all the worlds
and Master of masters!
Not on account of our righteousness
do we offer our supplications before You,
but on account of Your abundant mercy.
What are we? What is our life?
What are our acts of kindness?
What is our righteousness?
What is our deliverance?<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Of ourselves or others.</i>
What is our strength? What is our might?
What can we say before You,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers?
Are not all the mighty men
as nothing before You?
Famous men as though they had never been?
The wise as if they were without knowledge?
And men of understanding,
as if they were devoid of intelligence?
For most of their actions are a waste,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In terms of achievement.—Dover Sholom</i>

are trivial<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In terms of time.—Dover Sholom</i> in Your presence.
The superiority of man over the beast
is nil,
for all is futile,

All the nations are as nothing before you,

The nations are as a drop of a bucket—
no more than dust upon the scales
are they considered!
Behold, the isles are like the flying dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:15.</i>

Therefore, we are obligated

We are fortunate! How good is our portion!
How pleasant is our destiny!

And you shall bind them for a sign

And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house

You existed
before the world was created.
You exist [in the same way]
now that the world has been created.
You exist in this world,

Sanctify Your Name

And through Your deliverance
You will be exalted

for the sake of Your Name.
Blessed is He who sanctifies His Name

You are Adonoy, our God,
in heaven and on earth,

In truth, You are First,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">We refer to God as “First” to preclude the notion that anything existed before Him, but not to assert that He has a beginning.—Kuzari</i>

Korbanos (Sacrificial Offerings)

<small>The Talmud (<i>Maseches Menachos</i> 110a) states: Rabbi Isaac asked, “Why does it say (<i>Leviticus</i> 6:18; 7:1) This is the <i>law</i> of the sin-offering, this is the <i>law</i> of the guilt-offering? To teach us that when one <i>studies</i> the <i>law</i> of the sin-offering, it is considered as though he had actually brought it on the Altar, and when one <i>studies</i> the <i>law</i> of the guilt-offering, it is as though he actually brought it on the Altar.”</small>
<small>Rather than merely recite the following portions, study them and attempt to learn about the laws and significance of the various sacrifices.</small>
<small>Exodus 30:17-21</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say:
Make a copper laver
and a copper base, for washing;
and place it
between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar,
and put water in it.
Aaron and his sons will wash from it,
their hands and their feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">His right hand was held above his right foot, the left hand above the left foot and all were washed simultaneously. Maseches Zevachim 59</i>
Upon entering the Tent of Meeting
they will wash with water that they not die,
or whenever they approach the Altar
to serve, to burn a fire-offering to Adonoy.
They will wash their hands and feet
that they not die;
and this is for them a perpetual statute
for him [Aaron], and his descendants
for all their generations.
<small>The following Scripture section describes the removal of the ashes which had accumulated on the Altar from the daily burnt-offering of the previous afternoon. This removal was performed prior to the daily morning burnt- offering. The passage below also describes the ritual of maintaining the wood pyres which were always burning on the Altar.</small>
<small>Leviticus 6:1</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say:
Command Aaron and his sons to say,
this is the law of the burnt-offering.
This is the burnt-offering
[which must remain] on its pyre,
upon the Altar all night,
until morning,
and the fire of the Altar
will be kept burning on it.
The <i>Kohein</i> will don his linen garment,
and linen breeches upon his flesh,
and he will remove the ashes
when the fire consumes
the burnt-offering on the Altar;
and he will place them beside the Altar.
He will remove his garments
and don other garments,
and carry the ashes
outside the camp
to an undefiled place.
The fire upon the altar will be kept burning,
it may not be extinguished.
And the <i>Kohein</i> will burn wood on it
every morning,
and arrange on it the burnt-offering,
and burn on it the fats of the peace-offerings.
A constant fire
will be kept burning on the Altar,
it may not be extinguished.

Korban Tamid (Daily Offering)

<small>The <i>Tamid</i>-offerings, two daily offerings of one lamb at a time, were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The former was the first public- offering brought on the Altar each day. And the latter terminated the day's offer- ings. These animals were purchased from the annual half-shekel gifts of the people and were offered on behalf of the entire Jewish People. Before reading this passage we offer a brief prayer.</small>
<small>Some do not say the following prayer on Sabbath and Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
to have compassion on us,
to forgive us all our sins, [done unknowingly],
to atone all our iniquities, [done knowingly],
to pardon all our [malicious] transgressions,
and may You build the Holy Temple
quickly, in our days,
that we may offer, before You,
the daily burnt-offering to atone for us,
as You wrote for us in Your Torah
by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
from the mouth of Your Reverence,
as it is said:
<small>Numbers 28:1-8</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say:
Command the Children of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Kohanim, Levites and Israelites were to be present at the offering of the two daily public burnt-offerings. The Sages instituted the program of Maamodoth, under which representatives of all 12 tribes of Israel were always present when these sacrifices were offered. These representatives were rotated each week.</i>
and say to them:
My offering, My food,
to be consumed by My fires,
a pleasing odor to Me,
You shall be diligent to bring unto Me,
at its fixed time.
And you will say to them:
“This is the fire-offering
that you will bring unto Adonoy:
[male] lambs, in their first year,
without blemish,
two [of them] each day,
as a constant burnt-offering.
Offer one lamb in the morning,
and the second lamb,
offer in the afternoon.
And a tenth of an ephah<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See notes on page 54 for explanation.</i> of fine flour
as a meal-offering,
mixed with oil of crushed [olives]
measuring one-fourth of a hin.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See note on page 55 for explanation.</i>
[This is] a constant burnt-offering
as offered at Mount Sinai
for a pleasing odor, a fire-offering to Adonoy.
And its libation will be
a fourth of a <i>hin</i> for the one lamb;
in the Holy<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">On the Altar.</i> [Sanctuary] you will pour out
a drink-offering of strong wine to Adonoy.
And the second lamb
you will offer in the afternoon;
as the meal-offering of the morning
[together] with its libation, you shall offer
a fire-offering of pleasing odor to Adonoy.
<small>Leviticus 1:11</small>
And he will slaughter it
on the north side of the Altar,
before Adonoy;
and Aaron's sons, the <i>Kohanim,</i> will sprinkle
its blood all around the Altar.
<small>Some do not say the following prayer on Sabbath and Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
that this recitation be
important, acceptable
and desirable before You,
as if we sacrificed
the daily burnt-offering
at its proper time,
in its proper place
and according to its laws.

Ketores (Incense Offering)

You are Adonoy, our God,
before Whom our fathers burned
the incense of spices
when the Holy Temple was standing,
as You commanded them
by the hand of Moses Your prophet,
as it is written in Your Torah:
<small>Exodus 30:34-36</small>
And Adonoy said to Moses,
“Take for yourself spices—
stacte, onycha, and galbanum—<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Galbanum has an offensive odor. The Torah includes it among the other spices to teach us to include even Jewish sinners among the rest of Jewry at our assemblies of fasting and prayers.—Rashi</i>
spices, and pure frankincense,
[they] shall be in equal weights.
You will make it into incense,
a compound mixed by a compounder,
salted,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word, memulach is rendered by Onkelos as mixed, to indicate that the spices should be well mixed together.—Rashi</i> undefiled, and holy.
You will pulverize some of it very fine,
and place it before the [Ark of] Testimony<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">This incense was offered each day upon the Innermost Altar which is inside the Tent of Meeting.—Rashi</i>
in the Tent of Meeting,
where I will meet with you;
it will be to you holy of holies.”
It is also written:
<small>Exodus 30:7-8</small>
And Aaron shall burn upon it [the Altar]
incense of spices every morning;
when he cleans the lamps
he will burn it.
And when Aaron lights the lamps
in the afternoon,
he will burn it;
a constant incense-offering before Adonoy
throughout your generations.
<small>Maseches Kreisos 6a; <i>Jerusalem Talmud, Maseches Yoma</i> 4:5</small>
The Rabbis taught:
How was the incense compounded?
Three hundred and sixty-eight
manim<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">A maneh is a weight; plural, manim.</i> were comprised therein,
three hundred and sixty-five
corresponding to
the number of days in the solar year,
one <i>maneh</i> for each day—
half in the morning
and half in the afternoon.
From the three remaining <i>manim</i>
the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> brought
two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies]
on Yom Kippur;
[for which purpose] they were put back
into the mortar
on the eve of Yom Kippur,
and ground [again] very thoroughly,
in order to make them very fine.
Eleven kinds of spices were used for it.
They were:
1) balm, 2) onycha,
3) galbanum, 4) frankincense—
by weight, seventy <i>maneh</i> of each;
5) myrrh, 6) cassia,
7) spikenard and 8) saffron—
in weight
sixteen <i>maneh</i> of each;
9) twelve <i>maneh</i> of costus,
10) three of aromatic bark,
and 11) nine of cinnamon.
[Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine kabin<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">A kab is a sixth of a seah.</i> of Carshina lye,
Cyprus wine [measuring]
three <i>s'in</i> and three <i>kabin</i>—
if he had no Cyprus wine,
he could use strong white wine—
a fourth of a <i>kab</i> of Sodom salt,
and a minute quantity of maaleh ashan.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This herb causes the smoke of the burning incense to ascend in a straight line.</i>
Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says,
“Jordan amber was added
of a minute quantity,
and if one added honey,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Included are various sweeteners such as dates and other fruits.</i>
it (the incense) became unfit;
and if one omitted<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The same is true if one were to add to the prescribed number of eleven spices.—Etz Yosef</i> any of its spices
he was liable to the death penalty.”<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The death penalty was given only if the Kohein Gadol actually entered the Holy of Holies with incense which was unfit. This was considered as an unwarranted entry into the Holy of Holies which carried the death decree.—Rashi</i>
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel
says:
“The balm is nothing but sap
which drips from the balsam tree.
the lye of Carshina was used
for rubbing the onycha
in order to refine its appearance.
The Cyprus wine was used
to soak the onycha
to give it a pungent odor.
Though the water of Raglayim<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">This water came from a well named Raglayim.—Kol Bo</i>
was well suited for that purpose,
they did not bring
the water of Raglayim into the Temple
because it would be disrespectful.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Since Mai Raglayim (lit., water from the feet) is a euphemism for urine, it would have been disrespectful to use this water in the Temple. Others hold that the term “waters of Raglayim” actually refers to urine, which could have been used as a soaking agent were it not indecent to bring it into a sacred place.—Kol Bo</i>
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>:
Rabbi Nosson says,
“While [the <i>Kohein</i>] ground [the incense]
he would say,
<i>‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,'</i>
because the sound<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the sound of these specific words affects the spices.</i> is good for the spices.
If half<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">184 manim instead of 368.</i> the quantity of incense was prepared
it was acceptable,
but if only a third
or a fourth [of it was prepared]
we have not heard [whether it was acceptable.”]<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., we did not hear our teachers expound this question.</i>
Rabbi Yehuda said,
“This is the general rule:
If [it was prepared with all its ingredients]
in the correct proportion,
it is acceptable
even if only half was prepared;
but if he left out any of its spices,
he was liable for the death penalty.
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>:
Bar Kappara says,
“Once in sixty or seventy years<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The exact number of years varied with the size of the hands of the High Priests over the years, for the surplus was what remained of these three manim from which he took two handfuls each Yom Kippur.</i>
the accumulated surplus was sufficient
to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense.”]
Bar Kappara also taught,
“If he would have put into it
a minute quantity of honey,
no one could have withstood [resisted]
the scent.
Why was no honey mixed with it?
Because the Torah says, (<i>Leviticus</i> 2:11)
For any leaven or honey,
do not burn from them,
[as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.”
<small>Recite each of these verses three times:</small>
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob,
Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts,
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver [us]!
The King will answer us on the day we call.
You are my shelter;
from distress You preserve me;
with glad song of rescue, You envelop me,
Selah!
Let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem,
as in the days of old and in earlier years.
Abbaye listed
the order of the [daily] Altar service
based on tradition,
and according to the opinion of Abba Shaul:
the [arranging on the Altar of the] great Pyre<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">This is the altar upon which the daily and other offerings were burned. This pyre was on the east side of the Altar.—Derech Chayim</i>

[is arranged] before
the placement of two logs [on the large pyre<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Each of these logs measured a square cubit. They were laid on to assure a sufficiently large fire.— Derech Chayim</i> ]
the placement of the two logs precedes

and the two bowls of frankincense precede

Please, by the force of Your great right hand,

<small>Some do not say this paragraph on Shabbos and Yom Tov.</small>
Master of the Worlds, You commanded us
to bring the Daily offering
at its appointed time;
and have the <i>Kohanim</i> perform their service,
and the Levites
[sing and play music] on the platform,
and the Israelites
[attend] at their Ma'amad.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">All of Israel was divided into twenty-four divisions. Representatives of each division—in rotation—spent one week at a time in Jerusalem in attendance upon the services of the daily offerings, which were offered in behalf of all Jewry. Each such group or maamad represented all the Israelites at the services.</i>
And now, because of our sins,
the Holy Temple is destroyed,
and the Daily offering discontinued;
we have neither a <i>Kohein</i> at his service,
nor a Levite on his platform,
nor an Israelite at his Ma'amad.
Therefore let it be Your will
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
that the prayer of our lips
be considered, and accepted
and regarded favorably before You,
as if we had offered the Daily offering
at its appointed time,
and stood in attendance at its service,
as it has been said,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 14:3.</i>
“Let the offering of our lips replace
bullocks.”
And it is said,
And he will slaughter it
on the north side of the Altar,
before Adonoy;
and Aaron's sons, the <i>Kohanim,</i> will sprinkle
its blood all around the Altar.
And it is said,
This is the law
of the burnt-offering,
the meal-offering,
the sin-offering,
the guilt-offering,
the inauguration-offerings
and the peace-offerings.
On the Sabbath day [the offering is]:
two male yearling lambs without blemish;
two tenths [of an <i>ephah</i>] of fine flour
for a meal-offering
mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">All libations are of wine, measured according to the animal brought as a sacrifice.</i>
This is the burnt-offering for every Sabbath,
in addition to the daily burnt-offering
and its libation.
<small>On Rosh Chodesh add:</small>
And on your Rosh Chodesh days
you shall bring a burnt-offering to Adonoy.
Two young bullocks,
one ram,
seven male yearling lambs
without blemish.
And three-tenths [of an ephah<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Three-tenths of an ephah is a measure in volume equal to the displacement of:129-3/5 eggs.</i> ] of fine flour

for a meal-offering mixed with the [olive] oil,
for each lamb;
a burnt-offering of pleasing savor,
a fire-offering to Adonoy.
Their libations shall be:
half a hin<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">The hin is a liquid measure containing 12 logs, of which each log is approximately 6 eggs.</i> for [each] bullock,
a third of a <i>hin</i> for the ram,
and a fourth of a <i>hin</i> for each lamb—wine;
this is the burnt-offering of Rosh Chodesh,
each Rosh Chodesh,
for [all] the Rosh Chodesh days of the year.
And one he-goat
for a sin-offeing<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">This offering atoned for unintentional defilement of the Sanctuary and its holy vessels.</i> to Adonoy,
in addition to the daily burnt-offering
and its libation.
<small>The following sequence of Mishnayos and the selection from <i>Sifra</i> “Rabbi Yishmael Says,” were inserted after the Scriptural selections dealing with daily- offerings in order to give every Jew the opportunity to study/recite daily, the minimum of selections from Scripture, Mishnah, and Talmud. Even though <i>Sifra</i> is not actually a Talmudic tractate, it is a Tanaitic expansion of Mishnah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, OrachChaim</i> 50:1).</small>
<small>The following are <i>Mishnayos</i> found in the fifth chapter of <i>Maseches Zevachim.</i></small>
<b>MISHNAH I</b>

Rabbi Yishmael says:
through thirteen methods
the Torah is expounded:
<small>1) A conclusion drawn from a minor</small>
or lenient law,
to a major or more strict one.
2) A clarification based on identical words or terms in the Biblical text.
3) A principle derived from one Biblical text
or from two Biblical texts.
4) A rule followed by a detail.
5) A detail followed by a rule.
6) A rule followed by a detail,
which is in turn followed by a rule,
may infer only what is similar to the detail.
7) When a general rule requires
an explicit rule;
when an explicit rule requires generalization.
8) Something included in a general rule,
which was singled out to teach—
was not singled out to teach about itself,
but to teach (something new)
concerning the rule as a whole.
9) Something that was included in a rule
and was singled out in a case
similar to its rule,
—it was singled out to lessen
not to increase the severity of the case.
10) Something that was included in a rule
and was singled out in a case
which is not similar to its rule,
—it was singled out either to lessen
or to increase the severity of the case.
11) Something that was included in a rule
and was singled out for a new stipulation—
does not revert to its rule
unless Scripture restores it to its rule
expressly.
12) A matter deduced from its context,
or from a subsequent expression.
13) Also, two passages that
contradict each other
until a third passage
reconciles them.
May it be Your will
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days:
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.

Kaddish d'Rabanan

<small>Kaddish is not the name generally given to this prayer in the Talmud. It is referred to there as “May His great Name . . .”, because the congregational response beginning with these words is the heart of this prayer. Only in one minor tractate, (<i>Maseches Soferim</i> 16, 19, and 21) is it referred to as Kaddish.</small>
<small>Composed primarily in Aramaic, the language spoken and understood by most Jews in the Second Temple period (See <i>Tosafos</i> to <i>Maseches Berachos</i> 3a), nevertheless, several Hebrew phrases, which were familiar even to the unschooled, were also incorporated in the prayer.</small>
<small>This particular form of Kaddish d'Rabanan, is so named because of the insertion of the paragraph which begins with the words “Upon Israel and upon our Sages, etc.” This Kaddish is recited following the study of Talmud or Midrash and invokes God's blessings on the Sages of Jewry, the transmitters of the Oral Torah.</small>
Exalted and sanctified<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">These opening words refer to the fulfillment of God’s prophecy, through Ezekiel (38:23) “And I will thus exalt Myself and sanctify Myself; and I will be known in the eyes of the many nations, and they will know that I am Adonoy.”—Levush, Siddur HaGra (One should be very careful to emphasize the letter gimel (ג) when saying the word “yis g adal (יִתְגַּדַּל),” in order that it not be heard as “Yis k adal (יִתְקַּדַל),” from the word קְדָל which means neck.— Mishnah Berurah 56:2</i> be His great Name

and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase, the heart of the Kaddish, is found almost verbatim in Daniel 2:20.</i>

Upon Israel, and upon our Sages,
and upon their disciples,
and upon all the disciples of their disciples,
and upon all those who engage in Torah study
in this land

May there be unto them and unto you
abundant peace, favor, kindness,
compassion, long life,

May there be abundant peace from heaven

Pesukei Dezimrah

<small>The following sequence of prayers until Yishtabach (p. 94) is called <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i> (verses of praise). These selected Scriptural passages were arranged by the Gaonim of the ninth century, in fulfillment of the Talmudic statement (<i>MasechesBerachos</i> 32a), “A person should always praise God first and make his requests [offer his prayers] afterwards.” Beginning with <i>Baruch She'amar</i> (p. 80), it is forbidden to interrupt your prayer with conversation until after the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> (p. 132).</small>
<small>You are permitted to answer <i>Amein,</i> respond to <i>Barechu, Kaddish</i> and to say <i>Kedushah</i> even though you have passed <i>Baruch She'amar.</i> You are also permitted to say <i>Modim d'Rabbonon</i> and the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> together with the congregation.</small>
<small>If you are concerned that the saying of <i>Kerias Shema</i> will not be within the proper time should you follow the regular order of prayers, you are permitted to recite the entire <i>Kerias Shema</i> during the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i>.</small>

Hodu

<small>The first 28 verses of this section are taken from <i>1 Chronicles</i> 16:8-36, and the first 15 are almost identical with the first fifteen verses of Psalms 105. These prayers are mentioned in <i>Maseches Soferim.</i></small>
Give thanks to Adonoy, proclaim His Name;
make His deeds<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Make His Divine attributes (mercy, kindness, etc.) known to the world.—Siach Yitzchok</i> known among the nations.
Sing to Him, compose songs to Him,
speak of all His wonders.
Take pride<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Jew should be proud at being found worthy to utter God’s Name.—Siddur HaGra</i> in [uttering] His holy Name,
let the heart rejoice
of those who seek<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Seeking God is an end in itself and provides joy to those who earnestly seek Him.—Siach Yitzchok</i> Adonoy.
Search for Adonoy and His might,
seek His presence continually.
Remember the wonders He has performed,
His miracles,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">His “miracles” were witnessed by Jew and Egyptian alike in Egypt. His “laws” are the Torah He gave us at Mt. Sinai.—Iyun Tefillah</i> and the laws from His mouth.
[You,] the seed of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The entire section—the previous verses as well as the following verses—are addressed to the Jewish People, who are the seed of Israel, the chosen of God, who are asked to remember His wonders, miracles and laws.—Tzelosa d’Avrohom</i> His servant,
children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
He is Adonoy our God;
the entire earth is governed by His laws.
Remember His covenant forever—
the word He commanded
to a thousand generations—
which He made as a treaty with Abraham,
and [which was] His oath to Isaac.
He established it for Jacob as a statute,
for Israel as an everlasting covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This verse in following the preceding verse indicates that the original covenant which God made with Abraham was later confirmed to Isaac in an oath and then established for Jacob as a statute. After Jacob was given the name Israel, it became an everlasting covenant.—Tzelosa d’Avrohom</i>
Saying,
“To you I will give the Land of Canaan,
the portion of your inheritance.”
When you were only few in number—
very few, and strangers in it.
They wandered from nation to nation,
and from one kingdom to another people.
He permitted no one to oppress them,
and admonished kings<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Both Pharaoh and Avimelech were admonished for Abraham’s sake (Genesis 13:17; 20:3,7).</i> for their sakes.
“Do not touch My anointed ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word  מְשִׁיחָי can also be translated as “My great ones” and as such refers to the Patriarchs. “My prophets” refers to the Matriarchs, who were known to be prophets. Both were afforded extraordinary Divine protection.— Etz Yosef </i>
and do not harm My prophets.”
Sing to Adonoy all the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Siach Yitzchok maintains that this verse directs Jewry to sing to God in all the lands in which they are dispersed during their exile. Tzelosa d’Avrohom understands the verse to direct all the nations of the earth to sing to God.</i>
proclaim His deliverance from day to day.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">a) We are to proclaim our deliverance by God every day; b) We are to proclaim that our deliverance by God is a daily experience.—Tzelosa d’Avrohom</i>
Recount His glory among the nations,
His wonders among all the peoples.
For Adonoy is great and most extolled;
Awesome is He above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
whereas Adonoy made the heavens.
Beauty and splendor are before Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The word הוד  (beauty) indicates that which is itself beautiful, while הָדָר  (splendor) is the reflection of beauty. For example: the sun’s light is “beauty” itself while the moon’s light is splendor—a reflection of the sun. (This definition applies only to the Hebrew terms.)— Siddur HaGra </i>
strength and joy are in His presence.
Give to Adonoy families of peoples—
give to Adonoy glory and might.
Give to Adonoy the glory due His Name,
bring an offering and come before Him,
prostrate yourselves before Adonoy
in the splendor of holiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Yosef understands this as the “holy splendor” of God’s Sanctuary. Tzelosa d’Avrohom sees it as the splendor and joy of worship before God, as contrasted with secular, frivolous manifestations of beauty and splendor.</i>
Tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth,
for He established the inhabited world
so that it cannot be moved.
The heavens will rejoice,
the earth will exult,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> Simcha (rejoicing) describes one’s feelings at a new experience of happiness, whereas gila (exultation) describes the feeling one experiences over an ongoing situation of joy. Since there is nothing new on the earth  וְאֵין כָּל־חָדָשׁ תַּחַת הַשָּׁמֶשׁ (Koheles 1:9), it is said the earth will exult (gila); but the heavens will rejoice (simcha) because there is חִידוּשׁ in the heavens.— Gaon of Vilna </i>
and they will proclaim among the nations:
“Adonoy has begun His reign.”
The sea and its fullness will roar;
the field and all that is in it will jubilate.
Then the trees of the forest will sing with joy,
[receding] before Adonoy
when He comes to judge the earth.
Give thanks to Adonoy, for He is good,
for His kindness is everlasting.
And say, “Deliver us, God of our deliverance;
gather us and save us from the nations,
to give thanks to Your holy Name,
to be extolled in Your praise.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that we are privileged to sing Your praises and cling to You will make us praiseworthy.—Etz Yosef</i>
Blessed is Adonoy, the God of Israel
for all eternity,
and all the people said: “Amein”
and [they] praised Adonoy.”
<small>(The following verses are a selection from the Psalms.<i>)</i></small>
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves
at His footstool.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy Temple.</i>
Holy is He!<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Or Holy is it—i.e., the Temple.</i>
Exalt Adonoy, our God,
and prostrate yourselves
at His holy mountain,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Mount Moriah upon which the Holy Temple was built is holy itself even when the Temple is destroyed. The previous verse refers to the time of the Temple, the second verse refers to the period of its destruction.—Etz Yosef</i>
for Adonoy our God is holy.
And He, the Merciful One,
atones iniquity and does not destroy;
He frequently withdraws His anger
and does not arouse all His rage.
You, Adonoy,
withhold not Your mercy from me;
may Your kindness and Your truth<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> חֶסֶד (kindness) is the good God bestows without a promise, whereas אֱמֶת  (truth) is the fulfillment of His promise.— Siach Yitzchok </i>
always protect me.
Remember Your mercies Adonoy
and kindnesses,
for
they are from the beginning of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">God’s mercies to mankind started from the very day that Adam was created. God created the world in order to fill it with kindness as it is said: “A world of kindness was built” (Psalms 89:3).—Rashi</i>
Give might to God,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Attribute your victories to God’s might rather than to your own.—Siach Yitzchok. Rashbam and others hold that since God’s actions are a reflection of Israel’s deeds, the latter are, in a sense, the source of His might. Thus when Israel follows the wishes of God, they give might to Him.</i>
His pride (majesty) hovers over Israel,
and His might is in the clouds.
You are awesome, God,
from Your Sanctuaries,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">There is a spiritual Temple in the heavens which corresponds to the Temple on earth.— Radak. The Talmud (Maseches Zevachim 115b) notes that the word  מִמִּקְדָּשֶׁיךָ may also be read מִמְקוּדָשֶׁיךָ , from Your holy people, indicating that God is especially demanding of the most adherent to the Torah. When this occurs, the world is filled with awe and fear of God.</i>
Almighty of Israel—
He grants might and power to the people;
blessed is God.
Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy,
Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">These two verses (94:1-2) are an appeal to God during a time fraught with the sufferings of exile, when it seems as if God has forsaken His people. He is urged to reveal Himself as the Mighty champion of justice—S.R. Hirsch</i>
Arise, Judge of the earth!
Repay the arrogant their just reward.
Deliverance is Adonoy's.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Only God knows what is true deliverance for a person. Prayer is not always answered, because God in His infinite wisdom knows that granting the request is not always for our benefit. We must therefore bless and offer thanks to God regardless of whether our petition has been granted.—Siach Yitzchok</i>
Upon Your people is Your blessing. Selah.
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob. Selah.
Adonoy of Hosts!
Fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver [us].
The King will answer us on the day we call.
Deliver Your people
and bless Your inheritance,
tend them and uplift them forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Radak understands David to be asking God to raise the People of Israel above their enemies. Ibn Ezra says that God is being asked to act like a shepherd who brings his flock to high ground to save them from beasts of prey.</i>
Our soul yearned for Adonoy,
our help and our shield is He.
For in Him our hearts will rejoice,
for in His holy Name we trusted.
May Your kindness, Adonoy, be upon us,
as we have waited for You.
Show us Your kindness, Adonoy,
and grant<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">We hope to earn redemption through our deeds, but if we are found wanting, then “show us Your kindness”—overlook our deficiencies and “grant” us salvation.— Radak</i> us Your deliverance.
Arise—come to our aid,
and redeem us for the sake of Your kindness.
I am Adonoy, Your God,
Who brought you up from the land of Egypt;
open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Request all that you desire and I will fulfill every request.—Ibn Ezra. The Jerusalem Talmud (Maseches Taanis 3:6) indicates that the more one requests God’s providence—the “wider he opens his mouth”—the more he shows his belief in God’s ability to provide all of man’s needs.</i>
Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus,
fortunate is the people
for whom Adonoy is their God.
In Your loving kindness I trust,
My heart will exult in Your deliverance;
I will sing to Adonoy,
for He dealt kindly with me.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The foremost level of man’s trust in God is manifested in three situations: a) when he is confronted with trouble, b) when he seeks help, and c) after he has been helped. The Psalmist says: In my time of trouble, I trust in Your kindliness; I seek only Your help, for my heart exults in Your salvation; and I will sing to You afterwards for You have dealt kindly with me.—Siddur HaGra</i>

Mizmor Shir

<small>Psalm 30, once used to inaugurate the Holy Temple, is used today to inau- gurate our daily prayers, for the synagogue is a “Holy Temple in miniature” and our prayers take the place of the sacrifices. It is both a prayer for success and a declaration of thanksgiving.</small>
A Psalm,
a song for the inauguration of the Temple,
by David.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Since it was Solomon who built the Temple, why is its inauguration attributed to David? Rashi explains: David composed the song which would be sung at the inauguration later, in Solomon’s days.</i>
I will exalt You, Adonoy,
for You have upheld me,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"> Radak writes that the Hebrew word דִלִיתָנִי is an expression used to describe either a downtrodden or an uplifted state. The downtrodden state of the Jewish people is actually part of their uplifting says the Sfas Emes, as it is said, “when I was brought low, He delivered me” (Psalms 116:6). “My downtrodden state was the cause of my salvation,” proclaims David, just as when one lowers a bucket (דְלִי) into a well in order to bring up the water.</i>
and not let my foes rejoice over me.
Adonoy, my God,
I cried out to You, and You healed me.
Adonoy, You have raised
my soul from the lower world.
You have kept me alive,

Sing to Adonoy, [you,] His pious ones,
and give thanks to His holy Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of זֵכֶר קָדְשׁו is His ‘holy remembrance,’ but it refers to His Name; for the titles we bestow upon Him are our means of remembering Him.— Radak </i>
For His anger lasts only a moment,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A moment is a measure of time. God’s anger is limited to time (be it long or short) but God’s favor is unlimited.—Sfas Emes</i>
but there is [long] life, in His conciliation.
In the evening, one retires weeping,
but in the morning there is [a cry of] joy!
I said, in my serenity,
I would never be moved.
[But,] Adonoy, it was Your will [alone]
that established my mountain
as a stronghold.
When You concealed Your Presence,
I was terrified.
To You, Adonoy, I called,
and my Master I beseeched.
What gain is there
in [the shedding of] my blood?
In my going down to destruction?
Will the dust acknowledge You?
Will it proclaim Your truth?
Hear [me] Adonoy, and be gracious to me,
Adonoy, be a help to me.
You have turned my mourning into dancing,
You have loosened my sackcloth
and supported me with joy.
In order that my soul<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of כָבוד is glory. Rabbi Yerucham Levovitz explained that the soul is called כָבוד because its only function is to give glory to God.</i> might sing to You
and not be stilled,
Adonoy, my God, forever will I thank You.
<small>It is customary to stand while reciting the following paragraph.</small>
Adonoy is King, Adonoy was King
Adonoy will be King forever and ever.
Adonoy is King, Adonoy was King
Adonoy will be King forever and ever.
And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.
Deliver us Adonoy, our God,
and gather us from among the nations,
to give thanks to Your holy Name—
to be extolled in Your praise.
Blessed is Adonoy, God of Israel
from the world till the next world
and all the people said: “Amen, Praise God.”
Let every soul praise God.
Praise God.
<b>Psalm 19</b>
<small>In this psalm, David sings the praises of the Torah. The Kuzari notes that even though the skies “proclaim God's glory” and the Psalmist describes the sun so glowingly, David nevertheless concludes that in comparison to the Torah they are insignificant.</small>
To the Chief Musician,
a Psalm of David.
The skies recount the glory of the Almighty,
and His handiwork
is related by the firmament.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"> שָׁמַיִם , skies, refers to the heavenly regions beyond earth’s atmosphere, where the stars and planets orbit. רָקִיעַ , firmament, refers to the earth’s atmosphere where clouds form, and precipitation takes place. The verb לְסַפֵּר means to recount something which occurred in the past. Thus the stars and planets in the שָׁמַיִם recount the fact that long ago God created a glorious universe. The רָקִיעַ , on the other hand, relates that God’s handiwork is evidenced in the constant formation of clouds and in the precipitation of rain.

<b>Psalm 33</b>
<small>In this psalm, David expresses the joy of the righteous in the Divine Providence of God in every aspect of the world and in the affairs of man. For the righteous see the “laws of nature” only as an external cloak, concealing the true supervision of God. They see <i>through</i> the laws of nature and perceive the Divine order and providence of the Creator.</small>
Joyfully exult in Adonoy, [you] righteous ones,
for the upright, praise is fitting.
Thank Adonoy with the harp,
with the ten-stringed lyre sing to Him.
Sing Him a new song,
play skillfully with jubilation.
For upright is the word of Adonoy
and all His deeds [are done] with faithfulness.
He loves righteousness and justice
the kindliness of Adonoy fills the earth.
By the word of God, the heavens were made,
and by the breath of His mouth,
all their hosts.
He gathers like a mound
the waters of the sea,
He places in vaults the deep waters.
Fear Adonoy, all the earth,
of Him, be in dread
all dwellers of the inhabited world.
For He spoke and it became;
He commanded and it stood.
Adonoy annuls the counsel of nations,
He disrupts the intention of peoples.
The counsel of Adonoy will stand forever,
the thoughts of His heart
throughout all generations.
Fortunate is the nation
for whom Adonoy is their God,
the people He chose as His heritage.
From the heavens, Adonoy looks [down],
He sees all mankind.
From His dwelling place,
He watches intently
all the inhabitants of the earth.
He forms their hearts all together;<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud (Sanhedrin 37a) states: When a man mints many coins from the same mold, they are all exactly alike, but God formed all of mankind from Adam and no two men look exactly alike. The Sages in Berachos 58a add: just as no two faces are alike, so are no two personalities alike. Thus even though God made them all together, each has his own unique personality.</i>
He perceives all their doings.
A king is not saved by a great army;
a mighty man is not rescued
with [his] great strength.
A horse is deceptive [assurance]
for deliverance,
and with its great strength
it provides no escape.
Behold, the eye of Adonoy
is on those who fear Him,
on those who wait for His kindliness.
To rescue their soul from death,
and to keep them alive during famine.
Our soul yearned for Adonoy,
our help and our shield is He.
For in Him our heart will rejoice,
for in His holy Name we trust,
May Your kindliness, Adonoy, be upon us,
as we have waited for You.
<b>Psalm 34</b>
<small>This psalm is based entirely on an event that took place in David's personal life as related in <i>1 Samuel</i> 21:11-16. Forced to flee from Saul, he took refuge among the Philistines, where he was recognized as the slayer of Goliath. In order to escape death at the hands of his foes, David pretended to be an imbecile, and was sent away unharmed by King Avimelech.</small>
Of David,
When he acted insane
in the presence of Avimelech
and he [Avimelech] drove him away,
and he [David] left.
I will bless Adonoy at all times
constantly is His praise in my mouth.
In Adonoy does my soul take pride,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">David is proud that he is worthy of uttering God’s Name.</i>
the humble will hear [this] and rejoice.
Declare the greatness of Adonoy with me,
and let us exalt His Name together.
I sought Adonoy and He responded to me;
and from all my fears He saved me.
[Those who] look to Him are enlightened
and their faces
are never darkened [humiliated].
This poor man<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">David describes himself as a helpless indigent waiting for God’s compassion.—Radak</i> called and Adonoy heard;
and from all his troubles, He delivered him.
The angel of Adonoy encamps
around those who fear Him
and sets them free.
Taste and see that Adonoy is good;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Seporno says that taste refers to the senses whereas see refers to the intellect.</i>
fortunate is the man
who takes refuge in Him.
Fear Adonoy, [you] His holy ones,
for there is no deprivation
for those who fear Him.
Young lions feel want and hunger,
but those who seek Adonoy
will not lack any good thing.
Come children, listen to me,
fear of Adonoy will I teach you.
Who is the man who desires life,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">David does not say הֶחָפֵץ בַּחַיִּים ‘he who takes pleasure in life’ but הֶחָפֵץ חַיִּים , ‘he who desires life,’ whose only goal is life; that is, he desires to attain such a level of existence as can truly be called life. — S.R. Hirsch </i>
and loves days that he may see good?
Guard your tongue from evil,
and your lips from speaking deceitfully.
Turn from evil and do good,
seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of Adonoy are toward the righteous,
and His ears [are open] to their cry.
The face<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The expression פְּנֵי ה' , Face of God, describes Divine anger. See Leviticus 20:5, וֵשַׂמְתִּי אֲנִי אֶת פָּנַי בָּאִישׁ הַהוּא , “And I will set my Face against that man.”</i> of Adonoy is set against evildoers

They<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">They refers to the righteous ones (Rashi) and to the the repentant sinners (Ibn Ezra).</i> cry out and Adonoy hears
and from all their troubles, He saves them.
Adonoy is close to the broken-hearted
and those crushed in spirit, He delivers.
Many evils befall a righteous man,
and from all of them, Adonoy saves him.
He preserves all his bones,
not one of them is broken.
The cause of death of the wicked is evil;
and the haters of the righteous are doomed.
Adonoy liberates the soul of His servants,
and none are doomed
who take refuge in Him.
<b>Psalm 90</b>
<small>According to our Sages, Psalms 90 through 101, were said by Moses. According to <i>Radak</i>, David actually found this psalm in its written form and knowing it to be the prayer of Moses, included it in his book of psalms. It speaks of the frailty of man and the brevity of his life and asks for God's compassion and favor despite his wrongdoings.</small>
A prayer of Moses, the man of God:

in the morning
they are as grass, freshly grown.
[If] in the morning it blossoms,
and grows afresh
by evening it is cut off and shriveled.
So are we consumed by Your anger
and by Your rage are we terrified.
You have set our iniquities before You,
the sins of our youth<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate ‘our hidden sins [are exposed]’ see Metsudas Dovid</i>
before the light of Your countenance.
For all our days

He who dwells

For you [have proclaimed]:
“Adonoy is my refuge,”

No evil shall befall you,
and no plague shall come near your tent.
For His angels
He will command on your behalf—
to guard you in all your ways.
They will carry you upon their hands,
lest you hurt your foot on a rock.
You will tread upon lion and snake,
you will trample young lion and serpent.
Because he clings to Me with desire,
I will save him;
I will strengthen him,
for he knows My Name.
When he calls upon Me, I will answer him;
I am with him in distress,
I will free him and honor him.
I will satiate him with longevity,

Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us

“Had it not been for Adonoy Who was for us,”

“Had it not been for Adonoy

<b>Psalm 136</b>
<small>The Talmud (<i> Pesachim</i> 118a) calls this <i> psalm</i>  הַלֵל הַגָדוֹל, <i> the great praise,</i> because it describes how God, enthroned on high, sustains every living creature. The first twenty four verses call on us to thank God, the Master of the Universe, Who created it, redeemed us from Egypt, caused us to inherit the lands of Sichon and Og, and delivered us from our enemies. The twenty-fifth verse, נוֹתֵן לֶחֶם לְכָל בָּשָׂר, <i> He gives food to all flesh,</i> is viewed as the climax of the entire <i> psalm</i> . Feeding every creature, day in and day out, is the greatest manifestation of God's provident kindliness. Though He rules in supreme splendor, God is close to the needs of every creature.</small>

When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve God and to praise Him.—Radak</i> Adonoy,
and sing praise to Your Name, Most High.
To relate Your kindliness in the morning,
and Your faithfulness in the nights.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption. And while yet in the darkness of exile we proclaim our belief in His faithfulness.—Rashi</i>

in meditation upon the harp.
For You have given me joy, Adonoy,
with Your deeds,
at the work of Your hands<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath day of rest affords me the opportunity to observe and appreciate the greatness of Your work.—Radak</i> I sing joyously.
How great are Your works, Adonoy;
how infinitely profound are Your thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">God’s ‘works’ are the visible creation, while His ‘thoughts’ are the Divine purpose behind each created thing.—Seporno</i>
An empty-headed man cannot know,

it is so that they may be destroyed forever.
But You will remain on high forever
Adonoy.
For behold, Your enemies, Adonoy;
For behold, Your enemies shall perish;
dispersed shall be all evildoers.
You uplifted my horn<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Others translate, ‘You have increased my might like that of the wild ram.’</i> like that of a unicorn;
I am saturated with fresh oil.
My eye has seen [the defeat of]
those who spy on me;
of the wicked who rise against me,
my ears have heard [that they are doomed].
The righteous will blossom like a date palm,
like a cedar<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The palm and the cedar both enjoy a long life span and flourish during all seasons. Thus they symbolize the lasting happiness of the righteous in contrast to the short prosperity of the wicked.</i> in Lebanon, he will grow tall.
Planted in the House of Adonoy,
in the courtyards of our God
they will blossom.
They will still be fruitful in old age;
they will be full of sap and freshness.
To declare that Adonoy is upright;
He is my Stronghold;
in Whom there is no injustice.

Psalm 93

Adonoy had begun His reign
He has clothed Himself with majesty;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">On the sixth day, the Levites sang Psalm 93, ‘Adonoy is King, He has clothed Himself in majesty,’ because He completed the work of creating and reigned over all His creatures.—Rosh Hashana 31a</i>
Adonoy has clothed Himself,
He has girded Himself with strength.
He has firmly established the world
so that it cannot be moved.
Your throne stands firm from of old,
You are from eternity.
The rivers have raised—Adonoy—
the rivers have raised their voice,
the rivers raise their raging waves.
More than the sound of many waters,
mightier than the breakers of the sea
Mighty on high, are You, Adonoy.
Your testimonies are extremely faithful,
holiness is becoming to Your House,
Adonoy—for the length of days.

Ashrei

<small>Rav S.R. Hirsch writes that the six concluding chapters of the Book of Psalms are the most important gift of David's Divinely-inspired hymns that Israel trea- sures so greatly. These six psalms, 145-150, are an essential component of our daily prayers. Our Sages attach much significance to Psalm 145 in particular, and stated: “Whoever recites ‘A praise by David' three times a day is assuredly worthy of a share in the world to come” (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 4b). When recited in prayer, this psalm is always introduced with two verses from other Psalms (84:5 and 144:15). These verses contain the word fortunate three times, an allusion to this psalm being recited three times a day. These verses are so closely identified with Psalm 145 that it is commonly referred to as <i>Ashrei</i> (Fortunate).</small>
Fortunate are those who dwell
in Your house;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This verse referred to the Kohanim and the Levites who served (dwelt) in the Holy Temple (Your House); it is at all times applicable to scholars and devout men who study and pray in houses of worship and study.</i>

Fortunate is the people whose lot is thus;

A praise by David!
I will exalt You, my God, the King,
and bless Your Name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rav S.R. Hirsch, David here declares, “I will dedicate myself to serve You and to fulfill Your will in loyal obedience,” for in serving God, man causes His Name to be blessed.</i>
and extol Your Name forever and ever.
Adonoy is great and highly extolled,
and His greatness is unfathomable.
One generation to another
will praise Your works,
and Your mighty acts they will declare.
The splendor of Your glorious majesty,
and the words<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Not simply נִפְלְאתֶיךָ —a report of Your wonders—but דִבְרֵי נִפְלְאתֶיךָ the “words”—the lessons that Your wonders teach.— S.R. Hirsch </i> of Your wonders I will speak.
Of Your awesome might, they<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">People in general will speak of God’s wondrous might in punishing the wicked (Sodom, Egypt, etc.) while David will proclaim that God’s greatness is measured more by His kindliness than by His awesomeness.—Siach Yitzchok</i> will speak,
and Your greatness I will recount.
Mention of Your bountifulness
they will express,
and in Your righteousness joyfully exult.
Adonoy is gracious and merciful,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">He is gracious in bestowing reward and merciful in punishment.—Siach Yitzchok</i>
slow to anger and great in kindliness.
Adonoy is good to all,
His mercy encompasses all His works.
All Your works will thank You, Adonoy,
and Your pious ones will bless You.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Your works which are the cause of your being thanked by sensitive people; similarly, cause your pious ones to bless You.—based on S.R. Hirsch.</i>
Of the honor of Your kingship,
they will speak,
and Your might they will declare.
To reveal to men His mighty acts,
and the glorious splendor of His kingship.
Your kingship is the kingship for all times,
and Your dominion is in every generation.
Adonoy supports all the fallen,
and straightens all the bent.
The eyes of all look expectantly to You,
and You give them
their food at its proper time.
You open Your hand
and satisfy the desire of every living being.
Adonoy is just in all His ways
and benevolent in all His deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The penalties for transgressions are just, but God is gracious in the actual punishment inflicted on the sinner.—Siddur HaGra</i>
Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him,

the sea and all that is in them;
He keeps His promises faithfully forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">He alone has always proven dependable and faithful, for there are no limits to His essence and to His power.—Ibn Ezra, Radak</i>
He performs justice for the oppressed;
He gives bread to the hungry;
Adonoy releases the imprisoned.
Adonoy gives sight to the blind;
Adonoy straightens the bent.
Adonoy loves the righteous.
Adonoy protects strangers;
the orphan and widow
He enables to stand firm;
and the way of the wicked He thwarts.
Adonoy will reign forever;
your God, Zion, throughout all generations.
Praise God.
<small>In this Psalm, David imparts the knowledge to sustain and uphold the Jewish People, during their bitter exile. He tells them of their special and enduring relationship with God and of their role as permanent messengers of the word of God to all mankind.</small>
Praise God!
for it is good to sing to our God;
for [His] praise is pleasant, befitting.

the banished ones of Israel He will gather.

Great is our Master and abundant in power;

Adonoy causes the humble to stand firm;
He casts down the wicked to the ground.
Cry out to Adonoy in thanksgiving;
sing to our God with the harp.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Each musical instrument has its unique function. In the times of King David, the harp was used to arouse those who slept.

[He] Who covers the heaven with clouds,

He dispatches His command earthward;
His word races swiftly.
He provides snow like fleece,
He scatters frost like ashes.
He hurls His ice like crumbs;
who can withstand His cold?
He dispatches His word and melts them;
He blows His wind, they flow as water.
He declares His word to Jacob,
His statutes and His laws to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is the receiver and preserver of God’s divine Law, the Torah, which includes chukim, statutes which confine the physical, sensual aspects of man within the bounds of moral purity, and also mishpotim, laws which govern communal life.

He did not do so to any [other] nation;
and of His laws they were not informed.
Praise God.
<small>In this psalm, David sings of the moment when all the world will be imbued with the knowledge of God's all-embracing providence. All living creatures—from the infinite heights of heaven above (verses 1-7) down to the depths of the earth below (verses 7-12)—will join together in one great hymn of praise to their Creator, and acknowledge the uniqueness of Israel over all other nations.</small>
Praise God.

<small>The custom of reciting the following additions to <i>Pesukei Dezimrah</i> is men- tioned as early as the Gaonic era, specifically by Rav Amram Gaon. These verses were incorporated into our daily prayers because they speak so eloquently of God's majesty, and of the Divine providence which is the source of the power, riches, might, and honor of all human beings.</small>
<small>The first four verses (<i>1 Chronicles</i> 29:10-13) relate David's blessing to God, when he presented the gold, silver, and jewels he amassed for the construction of the Holy Temple. It was a day of great rejoicing as, following David's example, the leaders and princes also presented generous gifts for the construction of the Temple.</small>
<small>The following until after ישתבח should be said standing.</small>

Shiras Hayam

<small>In Temple times Shiras Hayam, the Song of the Sea, was sung by the Levites when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered.87 After the destruction, the Jews of the Holy Land continued the tradition, reciting the Shira at the end of the PesukeiDezimrah. The custom spread to Italy and from there to other Jewish communities. This daily recital is mentioned by Rav Saadya Gaon but not as an obligatory part of the service. Rambam calls it a “custom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Hilchos Tefillah 7:13.</i> Subsequently adopted by all communities, reciting the Shira became an integral part of our daily prayers.</small>
<small>Some hold that the <i>Shira</i> should be chanted aloud while standing. It should be sung with joy as at the time of the Exodus. <i>“Sheloh”</i> writes that reciting the <i>Shira</i> atones for sin, so that if one wishes to repent a serious sin, he should recite the Shira every day with great fervor.

awesome in praise, performing wonders.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">God is “awesome in praise” for we fear that all our praise will prove inadequate.

You stretched out Your right hand,

Nishmas

<small>The Mishna, (<i> Maseches Pesachim</i> 117b) refers to the following prayer as בִּרְכַּת הַשִּׁיר , <i> the blessing of song.</i> Some commentaries suggest that it is so named because it forms a lengthy song that concludes with the blessing of יִשְׁתַּבַּח on page 000. On weekdays, when there is not sufficient time to concentrate adequately on our prayers, we merely recite the concluding blessing of יִשְׁתַּבַּח , but on Sabbaths and Festivals we recite the prayer in its entirety.</small>
The soul of every living thing
shall bless Your Name, Adonoy, our God;
and the spirit of all flesh

Your mention, our King, continually.
From world to world,<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote"> 108 See note 1 on תפילה למשה , page 000.</i>
You are Almighty;

and responds, and is compassionate
in all times of trouble and distress.
We have no king, helper, supporter
but You.

God of all created things,
Master of all begotten things,<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote"> 109 Etz Yosef assumes that תּוֹלָדוֹת refers to events that occur in time.

Iyun Tefiloh says that בְּרִיוֹת , created beings, refers to everything God created during the six days of creation, whereas תּוֹלָדוֹת refers to those things that come forth, i.e., were “born” from the original created things. Thus He is God of all created things and Master of all begotten things even though they appear as products of nature.</i>

which You did for our fathers

from Egypt You redeemed us,

from the house of bondage, You liberated us;

from the sword You saved us
and from pestilence You removed us,

have You withdrawn us.
Until now
Your compassion has helped us

Do not abandon us, Adonoy, our God,

<small>On Yom Tov, the Chazzan begins here</small>
[You are] Almighty

Great in the honor of Your Name,
Powerful for ever
and awesome through Your awesome deeds;
the King Who sits on a throne
[that is] exalted and uplifted.
<small>On Shabbos, the Chazzan begins here:</small>
He Who dwells in eternity,
exalted and holy is His Name.
And it is written:
“Joyfully exult in God, [you] righteous ones,
for the upright, praise is fitting.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:1.</i>
Through the mouth of the upright,
You are exalted,
and with the lips of the righteous
You are blessed;
and by the tongue of the pious,
You are sanctified;
and in the midst of the holy,
You are extolled.
And in the assemblies
of myriads
of Your people, the House of Israel;
with joyful song
glorified will be Your Name, our King,
in every generation.
For it is the duty
of all beings, before You,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
to thank, to extol, and to praise; to eternalize
to glorify, to exalt, and to honor;
to bless, to elevate, and to acclaim [You,]
even beyond all the words
of song and praise
of David, son of Yishai,
Your servant, Your annointed.

Yishtabach

<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence add:</small>
<small>In this Psalm, said during the Ten Days of Penitence, the Jewish soul sings of the Jewish spirit ascending from the depths of the deepest misery of all, the burden of sin and guilt.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
Out of the depths
I have called to You, Adonoy.
My Master, hear my voice;
let Your ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.
If You God should take account of iniquities,
my Master, who could survive?
For with You is forgiveness,
in order that You be feared.
I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes;
and for His word, I wait.
My soul [waits] for my Master
more than the watchman [waits]
for the morning,
[more than] the watchman [waits]
for the morning.
Wait, Israel, upon Adonoy,
for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness,
and with Him there is much redemption.
And He will redeem Israel
from all its iniquities.
<small>The Half-Kaddish is recited by the Chazzan</small>
<small>Here, as elsewhere in the Liturgy, the Half-Kaddish marks the end of a distinct section of the prayers, in this case, the <i>Pesukei Dezimrah.</i></small>
<small>It is called the Half-Kaddish, the final three verses of the complete Kaddish having been omitted.</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
<small>It has become a universally-accepted custom to recite Barechu before proceeding to the blessings of Shema. Barechu, like Kaddish and Kedusha, cannot be recited unless a quorum—a <i>minyan</i> of ten adult males—is present. Barechu is also said by one who is called upon to read from the Torah.</small>
<small>The practice of saying Barechu is mentioned numerous times in the Talmud. It is even cited in the Mishna (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 49b) in the names of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael.</small>
<small>The Chazzan<i> says:</i></small>
Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small>The Congregation responds and the Chazzan<i> repeats:</i></small>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed
forever and ever.
<small> The two blessings יוֹצֵר אוֹר “He Who forms light” and אַהֲבָה רַבָּה “Great love,” are referred to as the blessings preceding Shema (<i> Maseches Berachos</i> 11a). According to Rambam they were formulated by Ezra and his Court (<i> Laws of Shema</i> 1:7).</small>
<small>You may not interrupt your prayers from this point on until after the <i> Shemoneh Esrei</i> . But you may answer “Amein” to the blessings of הָאֵל הַקָּדוֹשׁ “The Holy Powerful One” and שׁוֹמֵעַ תְּפִילָה “He Who heeds prayer;” say the thrice-repeated קָדוֹשׁ “Holy . . .” and בָּרוּךְ כְּבוֹד “Blessed is the glory . . .” of Kedusha; and answer Barechu. You may also answer אָמֵן יְהֵא שְׁמֵהּ רַבָּא “Amein, May His great Name,” when you hear Kaddish.” You may also answer Amein after the blessings of יוֹצֵר הַמְּאוֹרוֹת , “Who forms the luminaries,” and הָבּוֹחֵר בְּעַמוֹ יִשׂרָאֵל בְּאַהֲבָה , “Who chooses His people Israel with love.”</small>

Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: God is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the Kuzari is that “God’s glory” includes the angels, His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called God’s glory similar to a king’s retinue which is his royal splendor.</i>

On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—Kuzari</i>
<small>In the second of the blessings that precede <i>Shema</i> we praise God for His goodness in giving us His Torah, and pray for His help in the study of Torah. None of our petitions for the material goods of life approaches the fervor of this prayer for knowledge of the Torah and steadfastness in obeying it.</small>
[With] everlasting love You have loved us<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ אַהֲבָה רַבָּה , one should bear in mind that God’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of God’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called love.</i>

Recitation of Shema

<small>The recitation of Shema was part of the daily worship in the Holy Temple, and our Sages ordained that it be recited in the synagogue service, providing it a central place in the morning and evening prayers of each Jew. Its importance may be judged from the fact that the very first Mishnah in the Oral Torah opens with the question, “From what time may the evening Shema be read?”</small>
<small>In reading Shema, bear in mind that you are performing a Scriptural commandment. All three paragraphs should be read with <i> kavanah,</i> concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews' complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God's Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָלּ־לְּבָבְ֒ךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.</small>
<small>The following three words should be said when praying without aminyan:</small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
Hear, Israel:
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is One.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"> Deuteronomy 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שְׁמַע and last letter of אֶחָד are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עֵד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to God’s unity.— Avudraham  Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on God’s unity. The last word, אֶחָד “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that God, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Israel, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i>
<small>The following three lines are to be said silently:</small>
Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Israel” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Jacob said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moses did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Jacob ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a. When Moses went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise God by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם aloud.— Midrash Rabba to Deuteronomy </i>
And you shall love Adonoy your God
with all your heart<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Our Sages (Sifrei to Deuteronomy 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to God’s Law and make them instruments for His service.</i>
and with all your soul<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved God with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.</i>
and with all your possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to God and to Torah might entail.</i>
And these words
which I command you today,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">The teachings of the Torah should be ever fresh in your minds, as though you received it today.—Ibid.</i>
shall be upon your heart.
And you shall teach them sharply<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See to it that your children have a clear, and not a confused, stammering knowledge of the Torah.—Ibid.</i>
to your children.
And you shall discuss them
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall bind them for a sign
upon your hand,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:5-9. This paragraph contains 10 commandments: 1) accepting the “yoke” of heaven; 2) proclaiming the Unity of God; 3) loving God; 4) studying Torah (and you shall speak of them); 5) teaching your children; 6-7) reciting Shema in the evening and in the morning; 8-9) putting on the tefillin of the hand and head; 10) putting up mezuzos on the door posts.</i>
And it will be—
if you vigilantly obey My commandments
which I command you this day,
to love Adonoy your God,
and serve Him
with your entire hearts<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The service of the heart is prayer, as David said (Psalms 141:2) “May my prayers be acceptable to You as an incense [service].” </i>

The heavy rains which open the growing season in the fall and the showers which fall while the grain is ripening are of utmost importance.</i>

and your wine and your oil.
And I will put grass
in your fields for your cattle,
and you will eat and be satisfied.
Beware lest your hearts be swayed<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">One who is satisfied can easily be induced to forget the Source of his fullness.—Rashi</i>
and you turn astray,
and you worship alien gods
and bow to them.
And Adonoy's fury will blaze among you,
and He will close off the heavens
and there will be no rain
and the earth will not yield its produce;
and you will perish swiftly<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">No extension will be given. The “generation of the flood” was granted a reprieve of 120 years (Genesis 6:3) because they did not have from whom to learn; but you do have from whom to learn.—Sifrei, cited by Rashi</i>
from the good land
which Adonoy gives you.
Place these words of Mine<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Even in exile you must fulfill God’s commandments—Sifrei cited by Rashi</i>
upon your hearts and upon your souls,—
and bind them for a sign
upon your hands,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Between your eyes is not to be taken literally. The correct position of the phylactery of the head (shel rosh) is at the edge of the hair line directly above the place which is between the eyes.</i>
And you shall teach them to your sons,
to speak them<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">From the moment your son knows how to talk, begin teaching him the Torah.—Rashi.</i>
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.
In order that your days be prolonged,
and the days of your children,
upon the land
which Adonoy swore to your fathers
to give them [for as long]
as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying:
Speak to the children of Israel,
and tell them<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda bar Chaviva said that this third section was added to Sh’ma because of six important things contained therein: 1. the commandment of fringes, 2. mention of the Exodus, 3. the call to assume the yoke of God’s commandments, 4. the warning against heretical concepts, 5. the warning against straying after sinful desires, and 6. the warning against idolatrous worship.—Maseches Berachos 12b</i>

Moses will rejoice<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Why did our Sages institute three different forms for the Sabbath Shemoneh Esrei: in Maariv אַתָּה קִדַשְׁתָּ , in Shacharis יִשְׂמַח משֶה , and in Mincha אַתּה אֶחָד , whereas on Festivals all three services have the identical Shemoneh Esrei? Our Sages ordained these three separate forms to signify three kinds of Sabbath—the Sabbath of creation, the Sabbath on which the Torah was given at Sinai, and the Sabbath of the World to Come. Thus at Maariv, we say “ אַתָּה קִדַשְׁתָּ , You have sanctified the Seventh day—the climax of making heaven and earth” commemorating the Sabbath of creation. At Shacharis, we say, “ יִשְׂמַח משֶה Moses will rejoice in the gift . . . when he stood before You on Mount Sinai”—to commemorate the giving of the Torah. And at Mincha we say, “ אַתָּה אֶחָד , You are One,” to remind us of the Sabbath of the World-to-Come where indeed it will be revealed to all that He is One.— Siach Yitzchok Moses “Will” rejoice—the future tense is used to indicate that after the resurrection of the dead, in the World-to-Come, Moses will rejoice triply with all aspects of the Sabbath.—Metzudas Yehoshua</i>

A crown of glory<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 34:29.</i>
upon his head You placed
when he stood before You on Mount Sinai;
and two tablets of stone
he brought down in his hand,
upon which is written
[the command] to preserve the Sabbath,
and so it is written in Your Torah:
“And the Children of Israel shall preserve
the Sabbath,
to maintain the Sabbath for their generations
as an everlasting covenant.
Between Me
and between the Children of Israel,
it is a sign for all time
that in six days Adonoy made
the heavens and the earth,
and on the seventh day
He abstained from work, and rested.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 31:16, 17.</i>
And You, Adonoy, our God, did not give it<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath.</i>
to the nations of the lands;
nor did You give it as an inheritance
our King,
to worshippers of idols,
nor in its<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Sabbath’s rest.</i> rest
do the uncircumcised dwell.
For only to Israel, Your people,
did You give it in love—
to the seed of Jacob
whom You chose.
They shall rejoice in Your kingship—
those who preserve the Sabbath
and call it a delight.
The people who sanctify the seventh [day]
will all be satisfied
and delighted from Your goodness.
And in the seventh [day], You took pleasure
and You hallowed it.
“Most desirable of days,” You called it—
a commemoration of the work of creation.
Our God, and God of our fathers,
be pleased with our rest,
sanctify us with Your commandments
and give us our share in Your Torah;
satisfy us from Your goodness
and gladden us with Your deliverance,
and purify our hearts to serve You in truth.
And give us as our inheritance,
Adonoy our God,
in love and in pleasure
Your holy Sabbath;
and may Israel rest thereon—
the sanctifiers of Your Name—
Blessed are You Adonoy,
Sanctifier of the Sabbath.
<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
Be pleased, Adonoy, our God,
with Your people Israel and their prayer,
and restore the service
to the Holy of Holies in Your abode,
and the fire-offerings of Israel;
and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly.
And may You always find pleasure
with the service of Your people, Israel.

the remembrance of the Messiah

Remember us Adonoy, our God
on this day for well-being;
be mindful of us on this day for blessing,
and deliver us for life.
In accord with the promise of deliverance

Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
<small>At the words, We are thankful,<i>bend forward; <i>at</i> Adonoy <i>return to an upright position.</i></i></small>
We are thankful to You
that You Adonoy are our God
and the God of our fathers forever;
Rock of our lives,
the Shield of our deliverance,
You are in every generation.
We will give thanks to You
and recount Your praise,
for our lives
which are committed into Your hand.
And for our souls which are entrusted to You,
and for Your miracles of every day with us
and for Your wonders and benefactions
at all times—
evening, morning and noon.
(You are) The Beneficent One—
for Your compassion is never withheld;
And (You are) the Merciful One—
for Your kindliness never ceases;
we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</small>
We are thankful to You,
that You Adonoy are our God

God of all flesh,
Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning.
Blessings and thanksgivings
to Your great and holy Name
for keeping us alive, and sustaining us;
so may You always keep us alive

to observe Your statutes
and to do Your will,
and to serve You wholeheartedly

Blessed is the Almighty
to Whom all thanks are due.
<small>On Chanukah the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, see page 000.</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles
for the redemption, for the mighty deeds,
for the deliverances, and for the wars
that You performed for our fathers
in those days at this season.
In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons.
When the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified Name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly, forever and ever.
<small>(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, add:</small>
Inscribe for a good life
all the children of Your covenant.)
<small>If you forget to say this, you need not go back and repeat it. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever
and praise and bless
Your great Name with sincerity forever;
for You are goodness—
the Almighty, Who is our deliverance
and our help forever—
the benevolent Almighty.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
“The Beneficent” is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.
<small>To be said by the Chazzan</small>
<b>Birkas Kohanim</b><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In Leviticus 9:22, we find that after he completed the Divine offering, Aaron lifted up his hands and blessed the people. In like manner, his descendants, the kohanim, uttered the priestly blessing after performing the Temple Service. In our days on the occasions when the kohanim recite the priestly blessings, they do so immediately after the “We are thankful” prayer which terminates the Avodah (Service) section of the Shemoneh Esrei. When kohanim do not say the blessings, the blessings are mentioned by the Chazzan in his repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei.—Avudraham</i>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us
with the threefold blessing of the Torah,
written by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
pronounced from the mouth of Aaron
and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people;
as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"> Rashi paraphrases this blessing with the words “ יִכְבשׁ כַּעֲסו , May He withhold His anger” from you.</i>

You are peace and Your Name is peace.
May it be Your will that You grant us
and all of Your people, the House of Israel
life and blessing
for a safeguard to peace.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>

Bless us, our Father, all of us as one

My God, guard my tongue from evil<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer was the personal meditation of Mar the son of Ravina, which he recited after he completed his prayers (Maseches Berachos 17a), and it is therefore expressed in the singular. The Jew prays that his mouth, his tongue, and his lips, which have just served as the instruments for his communion with God, will not forfeit any of their moral purity in his dealings with his fellow men.—Yaavetz This prayer is based on the verse, “Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech” (Psalms 34:14). Even though good and evil depend on man’s will, he nevertheless prays for God’s help in controlling himself, so as to permit no insult to provoke his wrath, and to remain calm and silent even in the face of a curse.—Avudraham</i>

And all who plan evil against me,

<small>The following Psalm (27) is recited at the conclusion of services, morning and evenings, from the first day of Elul, through Shemini Atzeres.</small>
<small>The Psalm voices our prayer that God will be our light on Rosh Hashana enabling us to repel the darkness of sin through true repentance, and that He will be our salvation on Yom Kippur, through His compassionate atonement of our sins.</small>

whom shall I fear?
Adonoy is the strength<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rav S.R. Hirsch’s translates, “Adonoy is the source of my life’s strength,” thus David declares that God is the fount from which his life derives its power to resist all foes.</i> of my life,

One thing I request of Adonoy,
[only] that shall I seek:
that I may dwell<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of שִׁבְתִּי is “my sitting.” The Talmud states that “no man may ‘sit’ in the courtyard of the Temple except for the kings of the House of David.— Maseches Soteh 40b</i> in the House of Adonoy

and I will offer in His Tent,
sacrifices [accompanied] with trumpets of joy;
I will sing and chant to Adonoy.
Adonoy, hear my voice<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This verse alludes to Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. “Hear my voice,” refers to Rosh Hashana when we sound the shofar.

be gracious to me and answer me.
Of You, my heart has said,
“Seek My Presence”;

neither cast me off nor abandon me,

Adonoy, teach me Your way,
and lead me in the path of uprightness,

<small>The following prayer is said every Shabbos and on every Yom Tov</small>

Berich Shemei

<small>The following prayer is taken from the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshas Vahakhail</i>), the basic text of Kabbalah which was written by the Mishnaic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The <i>Zohar</i> states, “When the Torah is taken out to be read before the congregation, the heavenly gates of mercy are opened, and the Divine love is aroused; therefore one should say the following prayer.</small>
Blessed is the Name
of the Master of the Universe.
Blessed is Your crown and Your place.
May Your good will [be]
with Your people Israel forever.
The redemption of Your right hand,
show Your people in Your Holy Temple.
Bestow on us Your excellent light,
and accept our prayer with compassion.
May it be Your will
to prolong our lives in well-being.
Let me be counted
among the righteous,
so that You will have compassion on me
and protect me and all that is mine,
and all that belongs to Your people, Israel.
You are He
Who nourishes all and maintains all;
You are He Who rules over all;
You are He Who rules over kings,
and the kingdom is Yours.
I am a servant
of the Holy One, blessed is He,
I bow before Him
and before the honor of His Torah
at all times.
Not in man do I put my trust,
nor do I rely on any angel;
but only in the God of heaven
Who is the true God,
Whose Torah is truth,
Whose prophets are true,
and Who performs many deeds
of goodness and truth.
In Him I put my trust
and to His holy, honored Name
I utter praises.
May it be Your will
to open my heart to Torah,
and to fulfill the desires of my heart
and of the heart of Your people Israel
for goodness, for life, and for peace.
<small>The Chazzan takes the Torah and says the following verses, each of which is repeated by the congregation.</small>
Hear Israel,
Adonoy is our God,
Adonoy is One.
One is our God,
great is our Master;
holy is His Name.
<small>The Chazzan says:</small>
Declare the greatness of Adonoy with me,
and let us exalt His Name together.
<small>The Congregation responds:</small>
Yours, Adonoy, is the greatness, the might,
the glory, the victory, and the beauty,
for everything in heaven and on earth
[is Yours]; Yours, Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He.
Exalt Adonoy, Our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain
for Adonoy, our God, is holy.

on the people borne<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 19:4, “You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings.” See Isaiah 46:3, “Israel which are borne by Me from the belly, which are carried by Me from the womb.”</i> by Him,

<small>When the Torah is unrolled, the Reader says:</small>
May He help, shield, and deliver

Let us all ascribe greatness to our God
and give honor to the Torah.
Let the Kohein come forward.
Arise, son of , the Kohein,

<small>The Congregation responds:</small>
And you who cling to Adonoy, Your God,

<small>(The following blessings are recited by every person called to the Torah.)</small>
<small>The Kohein walks up to the Torah and says:</small>
Blessed Adonoy, Who is blessed.
<small>The Congregation responds and the Kohein repeats:</small>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed,
forever and ever.
<small>The Kohein says:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy

In reward for this, may her father and mother merit to raise her for a master of the Torah, to the canopy and to good deeds; and let us say, Amen!

Birchas Hagomeil

<small>Rav says, (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 54) that four are obligated to offer thanks: persons who have safely completed a sea or land journey, or who have recovered from a serious illness, or have been released from captivity. One who is obligated to recite the blessing of thanksgiving should do so at the Torah-scroll, after the blessing following the Torah reading is said.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who bestows goodness upon the guilty,
Who has bestowed every goodness upon me.
<small>The congregation responds:</small>
He Who has bestowed goodness upon you,
may He bestow every goodness upon you,
forever.
<b>Blessing by the father of a Bar Mitzvah</b>
<small>The following blessing is said by the father of a Bar Mitzvah, after the lad has been called to the Torah and has recited the blessing following the reading:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who has released me from the punishment
of this [boy].
<small>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Half Kaddish is recited by the Reader. The Maftir is read and then the Torah is raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</small>
This is the Torah which Moses placed
before the children of Israel.
at Adonoy's command by the hand of Moses.
It is a tree of life
to those who grasp to it,
and those who support it are fortunate.
Its ways are ways of pleasantness,
and all its paths are peace.
Long life is at its right,
at its left, riches and honor.
Adonoy desired,
for the sake of His righteousness,
to make the Torah great and to glorify it.

Berachos for the Haftarah

<small><i> The Haftarah,</i> a selected reading from the Prophets, usually contains some reference to the text or theme of the Sidrah, the Torah Reading, which precedes it. According to <i> Avudraham,</i> the recitation of the <i> Haftarah,</i> was instituted during the period of persecution preceding the revolt of the Maccabees, when the actual Torah reading was prohibited. Readings from the Prophets were then substituted in order to review some of the teachings contained in the Torah itself. The word הַפְטָרָה is derived from the root פטר , which means to discharge or conclude. By reading the Haftarah, we conclude the reading of the Torah.</small>
<small>Berachah recited before the reading of the Haftarah:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who chose good prophets,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The true prophet must be genuinely tov “good” and a friend to all men both in his attitude and in his conduct. The heart of a true prophet in Israel must be capable of genuine rejoicing when individuals and mankind flourish, and of sincere sorrow when they go into decline. The Jewish prophet stands in the service of tov of the kingdom of the absolute good whose messenger he is meant to be.—S. R. Hirsch</i>
and was pleased with their words<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The prophet is given only the basic content of the ideals which he is to proclaim. The words in which he expresses the theme communicated to him however, are his own. According to the Sages אֵין שְׁנֵי נְבִיאִים מִתְנַבְאִין בְּסִגְנוֹן אֶחָד , each prophet has a style, peculiar to him alone, hence a prophet requires the gift of eloquence. God chooses as His prophets only such men whose words are נֶאֶמָרִים בֶּאֶמֶת , spoken in truth.— S. R. Hirsch </i>
which were spoken in truth.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who chooses the Torah
and Moses, His servant,
and Israel, His people,
and the prophets of truth and righteousness.
<small>Berachos recited after the reading of the Haftarah:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Rock of all the worlds,
Righteous in all generations,
the Almighty, the Faithful One,
Who says and does,
Who speaks and fulfills,
for all His words are true and right.
Dependable are You, Adonoy, our God,
and dependable are Your words,
and not one of Your words
is ever retracted unfulfilled,
for You are the Almighty,
a King who is dependable and merciful.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
the Almighty
Who is dependable in all His words.
Have compassion on Zion
for it is the home of our life,
and the one whose soul is humiliated,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is the People of Israel, which is humiliated in exile. According to Avudraham and the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon, the text reads: וְלַעֲגוּמַת נֶפֶשׁ which would mean “the one whose soul is grieved.”</i>
deliver speedily, in our days.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who causes Zion to rejoice
with her children.
Cause us to rejoice, Adonoy, our God,
with Elijah the prophet, Your servant,
and with the kingdom of the House of David,
Your anointed.
Speedily may he come
and cause our heart to exult.
Upon his throne, no stranger<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">“Stranger” in this context means anyone not of the seed of David.</i> shall sit,
and others will no longer inherit
his honor.
For by Your holy Name, You swore to him,
that his light will never be extinguished.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Shield of David.
<small>On Fast-days the berachos end here.</small>
<small>On Shabbos conclude with this berachah:</small>
For the Torah, for the Divine Service
for the Prophets,
and for this Sabbath Day
which You gave us, Adonoy, our God,
for holiness and for rest,
for honor and for glory.
For all this, Adonoy, our God,
we thank You,
and bless You;
blessed be Your Name
by the mouth of all the living
continually forever.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Sanctifier of the Sabbath.
<small>On Yom Tov conclude with this berachah:</small>
For the Torah, for the Divine Service
for the Prophets.
<small>(If a Yom Tov occurs on Shabbos add:</small>
for this Sabbath Day)
and for this day of (<i>choose the appropriate one</i>:)
the Festival of Matzos
the Festival of Shavuous
the Festival of Sukkos
the Festival of Shemini Atzeres
which You gave us, Adonoy, our God
(<i>on the Sabbath add</i>: for holiness and for rest)
for happiness and for joy,
for honor and for glory.
For all this, Adonoy, our God
we thank You
and bless You;
blessed be Your Name
by the mouth of all the living
continually forever.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Sanctifier of Israel and the Seasons.
<small>(On Shabbos and Yom Tov say:</small>
Sanctifier of Shabbos and Israel
and the Seasons.)
<small>On the last days of Pesach and Shavuos, and on Shemini Atseres, the Yizkor prayers (pages 000-000) are recited here. If these days should occur on Shabbos, Yizkor is recited after Yekum Purkon.</small>
<small>Following the readings from the Torah and the Prophets, (the Divine laws and knowledge handed to us in <i>writing,</i>) we proceed to prayers for the survival, support and welfare of the men who perpetuate these laws by teaching and studying the <i>Oral Law</i>. The Babylonian Talmud, the <i>Oral Law</i> was organized in its present form in Babylonia, consequently the first two prayers were composed there in Aramaic, the language used and understood by most Jews.</small>

Yekum Purkon

<small>The following three prayers are said only on Sabbath, they are not said on Yom Tov that occurs on weekdays.</small>
<small>According to Mishna Berurah 101:19 one who prays without a minyan should not say any of the following prayers, but rather begin <i>Father of Compassion</i> on page 000.</small>
May there arise deliverance from Heaven—
favor, kindliness, compassion,

For our masters, and our sages,

and in Babylonia.
For the heads of Torah assemblies,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages often use the word כַּלֵי in reference to Agadic lectures, and thus רֵישֵׁי כַלֵי would be translated as the chief lecturers, (דַרְשָׁנִים).

Prayer for the Government

<small>The custom to pray for the welfare of the government is mentioned in <i>Kol Bo</i> and <i>Avudraham.</i> The latter writes, “After the reading of the Torah, it is customary to bless the king and pray to God that he be given might and power over his enemies. This prayer is based on <i>Jeremiah</i> 29:7, “Seek the peace of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to Adonoy in its behalf; for in its peace, you will have peace.” We also find reference to such prayer in the Mishna, (<i>Maseches Avos</i> 3:2), “Rabbi Chanina, Deputy Kohein Gadol, says: Pray for the welfare of the government, because if people had no fear of it, they would swallow each other alive.”</small>
He Who grants deliverance to kings,
and dominion to princes,
His kingship is a kingship of all worlds;
He [Who] rescued David, His servant,
from the evil sword,
Who put a road through the sea,
and a path amid the mighty waters;
may He bless, preserve, and guard,
help, exalt, and make great,
and raise high
the President of these United States,
and the Vice President.
May the Supreme King of kings in His mercy,
sustain them in life and preserve them;
and from all distress, sorrow, and hurt,
may He save them.
May the Supreme King of kings in His mercy,
instill in their hearts compassion
to do good with us
and with all Israel.
In their days and in ours,
may Judah be delivered
and Israel dwell in security,
and the Redeemer come to Zion.
May this be His will
and let us say, Amein.

Blessings of the New Month

<small> The following prayer יְהִי רָצוֹן , composed by Rav, head of the Babylonian yeshiva at Sura, is mentioned in the Talmud, (<i> Maseches Berachos</i> 16b), but not as a prayer specifically ordained for blessing the new month. It was actually a daily prayer that Rav recited <i> each</i> day after the regular service.</small>
<small>The יְהִי רָצוֹן was adapted by Ashkenazi Jews as a prayer for the coming of the new month by adding the words: שֶׁתְּחַדֵשׁ עָלֵינוּ אֶת הַחוֹדֶשׁ הַזֶּה לְטוֹבָה וְלִבְרָכָה but Sephardic Jews omit the entire prayer as it is not mentioned either by <i> Rambam</i> or <i> Avudraham.</i></small>
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
to renew this [coming] month for us
for goodness and blessing.
Grant us long life—
a life of peace,
a life of goodness,
a life of blessing,
a life of sustenance,
a life of bodily vigor,
a life in which there is
fear of Heaven and fear of sin
a life in which there is no
shame or disgrace,
a life of prosperity and honor,
a life in which there will be
love of Torah and fear of Heaven,
a life [in which]
will be fulfilled the wishes of our hearts
for goodness. Amein, Selah.
<small>The following prayer, is the actual blessing of the month. The Chazzan takes the Torah in his hands and declares:</small>
He Who performed miracles for our fathers,
and redeemed them from slavery to freedom,
may He redeem us soon
and gather our dispersed
from the four corners of the earth;
united in friendship is all of Israel!
And let us say, Amein.
The new month of (<i>name the month</i>),
which will be on (<i>name the day or days</i>)
will come to us and all Israel
for goodness.
May He renew it,
the Holy One, blessed is He,
for us and for all His people,
the House of Israel,
for goodness and blessing
for happiness and for rejoicing,
for deliverance and for consolation,
for plentiful sustenance,
and support,
for good life and for peace,
for good tidings,
and for good news,
for rain at the proper time,
for total recovery,
and for early redemption,
and let us say, Amein.

Av Horachamim

<small>According to <i>Shaar Ephraim,</i> this prayer was composed during the persecutions of 1075 and 1095 when thousands of Jews were killed in sanctification of God's Name.</small>
<small>אַב הָרַחֲמִים is said every Shabbos except: when the new moon is blessed, on Rosh Chodesh, on Yom Tov, on Chanukah or Purim, when there is a bridegroom, or when one whose son is to be circumcised on that day is present in the congrega- tion. Between Pesach and Shavuous, אַב הָרַחֲמִים is said in many congregations even on the Shabossos when the new month is blessed.</small>
Father of compassion,
Who dwells on high,
in His profound mercy,
He will be compassionately mindful of
the pious,
the upright, and the blameless ones;
the holy communities
who gave their lives
for the sanctification of the Divine Name.
They were beloved and pleasant

and in their death
are not parted [from Him].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">2 Samuel 1:23.</i>
They were swifter than eagles
and stronger than lions
to do the will of their Possessor
and the desire of their Rock.
Our God will recall them favorably
together with the other righteous of all time.
And will avenge the blood of His servants
that has been shed.
As it is written in the Torah of Moses,
the man of God,
“Sing [you] nations, [the praise] of His people,
for the blood of His servants will He avenge,
and vengeance will He repay to His foes;
and His land will be atoned
[with the atonement] of His people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:43, see Rashi.</i>
And by the hands of Your servants,

it is written saying:

And it says:

and has not sworn deceitfully.
He will bear Adonoy's blessing
and righteousness
from the God of his deliverance.
This is the generation of those who seek Him,
the seekers of Your Presence,
[God of] Jacob, selah.
Lift up your heads, gates,
and be uplifted
[you] entranceways to eternity,
so that the King of Glory may enter.
Who is this King of Glory?
Adonoy, strong and mighty;
Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle.
Lift up your heads, gates,
and lift up, entranceways to eternity,
so that the King of Glory may enter.
Who is He, this King of Glory?
Adonoy of hosts,
He is the King of Glory, <i>selah.</i>
<small>As the Torah is returned to the Ark the following is said:</small>
And when it rested, he would say:
Return, Adonoy,
to the myriads and thousands of Israel.
Arise, Adonoy unto Your resting place,
You and the Ark of Your strength.
Let Your priests
clothe themselves in righteousness,
and let Your devoted ones sing in joy.
For the sake of David, Your servant,
do not reject Your anointed.
For I have given you good instruction,
do not forsake My Torah.
It is a tree of life to those who grasp it,
and those who support it are fortunate.
Its ways are ways of pleasantness
and all its paths are peace.
Cause us to return to You, Adonoy,
and we shall return;
renew our days as of old.
<small>The Chazzan recites the Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will,
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach.
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Shabbos Shuva:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

<b>DIVINE MIGHT</b>
You are mighty forever, my Master;

<b>Kedushah</b>
<small>The Congregation says and the Chazzan repeats:</small>
A crown is given to You
Adonoy, our God
by the angels on high
and by Your people who assemble below:
all of them together
thrice repeat “holy” unto You
as is said by way of Your prophet,
“And they called one to another, and said:
<small>Congregation and Chazzan:</small>
‘Holy, holy, holy,
is Adonoy of hosts,
the fullness of all the earth is His glory.'”
His glory fills the world,
His ministering angels ask one another—
“Where is the place of His glory?”
Facing them, they offer praise and say:
<small>Congregation and Chazzan:</small>
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy
from His place.”
From His place, He will turn in compassion,
and favor the people
who proclaim the Oneness of His Name;
evening and morning, each day, continually,
twice each day, with love, they recite “Shema.”
<small>Congregation and Chazzan:</small>
“Hear Israel,
Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.”
He is our God, He is our Father,
He is our King, He is our Deliverer,
He will deliver us
and redeem us again
and He will let us hear in His mercy
a second time
in the presence of all the living
saying:
Behold, I have redeemed you
from this final [exile] as from the first,
to be your God.
“I am Adonoy, your God.”
And among Your holy words it is written:
<small>Congregation and Chazzan:</small>
“Adonoy will reign forever,
your God, Zion, throughout all generations!
Praise God.”
<small>The Chazzan concludes:</small>
From generation to generation
we will declare Your greatness,

we will sanctify Your holiness,
and Your praise, our God,
will not depart from our mouths
forever and ever;

You instituted the Sabbath

to bring us up<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Based on Biblical sources, our Sages have stated that the land of Israel is elevated above all the surrounding lands.</i> in joy to our land,
and to plant us within our borders.
There we will offer before You
our mandatory sacrifices—
the daily-offerings in their sequence,
and the Musaf-offerings
according to their laws.
And the Musaf of this Sabbath Day,
we will offer and bring near before You
with love,
according to the command of Your will;
as You wrote for us in Your Torah,
through the hands of Moses, Your servant,
from the mouth of Your glory, as it is said:
On the Sabbath day [the offering is]:
two male yearling lambs without blemish;
two tenths [of an <i>ephah</i>] of fine flour
for a meal-offering
mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation.
This is the burnt-offering for every Sabbath,
in addition to the daily burnt-offering
and its libation.
They shall rejoice in Your kingship—
those who preserve the Sabbath
and call it a delight.
The people who sanctify the seventh day
will all be satisfied
and delighted from Your goodness.
And in the seventh day—You took pleasure
and You hallowed it.
“Most desirable of days,” You called it—
a commemoration of the work of creation.
Our God, and God of our fathers,
be pleased with our rest,
sanctify us with Your commandments
and give us our share in Your Torah;
satisfy us from Your goodness
and gladden us with Your deliverance,
and purify our hearts to serve You in truth.
And give us as our inheritance,
Adonoy our God,
in love and in pleasure
Your holy Sabbath;
and may all Israel rest thereon—
the sanctifiers of Your Name—
Blessed are You Adonoy,
Sanctifier of the Sabbath.
<small>On a regular Shabbos continue “Be pleased,” on page 000.</small>
<small>When Rosh Chodesh occurs on Shabbos:</small>
You formed Your world of old,
You completed Your work
on the seventh day.
You chose us from among all people.
You loved us and took pleasure in us,
and exalted us above all tongues
and sanctified us with Your commandments.
You drew us near, our King, to Your service;
and Your great and holy Name
have You pronounced upon us.
And You, gave us Adonoy our God,
with love
Sabbaths for rest
and Rosh Chodesh days for atonement.
But because we sinned before You—
we and our fathers—
our city was destroyed,
and our Holy Temple was laid waste,
and our honor was banished;
and glory was removed
from the house of our life.
And we are [therefore] unable
to fulfill our obligations
in Your Chosen House,
in the great and holy house
upon which Your Name was called,
because of the [violent] hand
that was sent to [attack] Your Sanctuary.
May it be Your will
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
to bring us up in joy to our land
and to plant us within our borders,
and there we will offer before You
our obligatory sacrifices—
daily-offerings in their sequence,
and Musaf-offerings according to their laws.
And the Musaf-offerings of this Sabbath day,
and this Rosh Chodesh day,
we will offer and bring near before You
with love,
according to the command of Your will,
as You wrote for us in Your Torah,
through the hands of Moses, Your servant,
from the mouth of Your glory as it is said:
“And on the Sabbath day the offering is:
two male yearling lambs without blemish;
two tenths [of an <i>epha</i>] of fine flour
for a meal-offering
mixed with the [olive] oil, and its libation.
This is the burnt-offering for every Sabbath
in addition to the daily burnt-offering
and its libation.
This is the sacrifice of Shabbos
and the sacrifice of today, as it is said
And on your Rosh Chodesh days
you shall bring a burnt-offering to Adonoy
two young bullocks,
one ram,
seven male yearling lambs
without blemish.
And their meal-offering and libations
as prescribed:
three tenths of an [<i>epha</i>] of fine flour
for each bullock,
two tenths for the ram,
and one tenth for each lamb,
and wine according to each libation;
and a he-goat for atonement,
and the two daily burnt-offerings
according to their law.
They shall rejoice in Your kingship—
those who preserve the Sabbath
and call it a delight.
The people who sanctify the seventh day
they will all be satisfied
and delighted from Your goodness.
And in the seventh day—You took pleasure
and You hallowed it.
“Most desirable of days,” You called it—
a commemoration of the work of creation.
Our God and God of our fathers,
be pleased with our rest
and renew for us on this Sabbath day
this new month
for goodness and for blessing,
for happiness and for rejoicing,
for deliverance and for consolation,
for maintenance and for sustenance,
for life and for peace,
for forgiveness of sins
and for pardon of iniquities;
<small>(on a leap year add:</small>
and for atonement of transgression).
And may this month be
the end and finish of all our troubles,
the beginning and prelude
of the redemption of our souls,
for Your people, Israel
have You chosen from among all nations,
and Sabbaths,
have You made known to them,
and the statutes of Rosh Chodesh days,
You established for them.
Blessed are You
Sanctifier of the Sabbath, and Israel
and Rosh Chodesh days.
<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
Be pleased, Adonoy, our God,
with Your people Israel and their prayer,
and restore the service
to the Holy of Holies in Your abode,
and the fire-offerings of Israel;
and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly.
And may You always find pleasure
with the service of Your people, Israel.
And may our eyes behold
Your merciful return to Zion.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
<small>At the words, We are thankful, <i>bend forward; at </i>Adonoy <i>return to an upright position.</i></small>
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
We are thankful to You
that You Adonoy are our God,
and the God of our fathers forever;
Rock of our lives,
the Shield of our deliverance,
You are in every generation.
We will give thanks to You
and recount Your praise,
for our lives
which are committed into Your hand,
and for our souls which are entrusted to You,
and for Your miracles of every day with us
and for Your wonders and benefactions
at all times—
evening, morning and noon.
(You are) The Beneficent One—
for Your compassion is never withheld;
And (You are) the Merciful One—
for Your kindliness never ceases;
we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</small>
We are thankful to You,
that You Adonoy are our God
and God of our fathers,
God of all flesh,
our Creator, Creator of the Beginning.
Blessings and thanksgivings
to Your great and holy Name
for keeping us alive, and sustaining us;
so may You always keep us alive
and sustain us,
and gather our exiles
to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary
to observe Your statutes
and to do Your will,
and to serve You wholeheartedly
for we are thankful to You.
Blessed is the Almighty
to Whom all thanks are due.
<small>On Chanukah the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, see page 000.</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles
for the redemption, for the mighty deeds,
for the deliverances, and for the wars
that You performed for our fathers
in those days at this season.
In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons.
When the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified Name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly, forever and ever.
<small>(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, add:</small>
Inscribe for a good life
all the children of Your covenant.)
<small>If you forget to say this, you need not go back and repeat it. If you became aware of the omission before concluding the blessing, you can say it at that time.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever
and praise and bless
Your great Name with sincerity forever;
for You are goodness—
the Almighty, Who is our deliverance
and our help forever—
the benevolent Almighty.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
“The Beneficent” is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.
<small>To be said by the Chazzan</small>
<b>Birkas Kohanim</b>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us
with the threefold blessing of the Torah,
written by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
pronounced from the mouth of Aaron
and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people;
as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.
<small>After Birkas Kohanim the congregation says:</small>
Mighty One on high who dwells in might,
You are peace and Your Name is peace.
May it be Your will that You grant us
and all of Your people, the House of Israel
life and blessing
for a safeguard to peace.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing,
life favor, kindness and compassion
upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one
with the light of Your countenance.
For by the light of Your countenance
You gave us Adonoy our God,
a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,
righteousness, blessing, compassion,
life, and peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace
(with much strength and peace).
<small>*(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, continue here:)</small>
In the book of life, blessing, peace
and abundant maintenance,
good decrees, salvations and condolences,
may we be remembered and inscribed
before You;
we and all Your people, the House of Israel
for a good life and peace.
<small>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil
and my lips from speaking deceitfully.
To those who curse me,
may my soul be unresponsive;
and let my soul be like dust to all.
Open my heart to Your Torah
and let my soul pursue Your commandments.
And all who plan evil against me,
quickly annul their counsel
and frustrate their intention.
(May it it be Your will
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that no person be envious of me
and that I not be envious of others,
that I not be brought to anger this day,
and that I not cause Your anger;
and save me from the evil inclination,
and help me be humble and any modest.
Our King and our Father,
unify Your Name in Your world,
rebuild Your city, establish Your house
and perfect your sanctuary.
Gather our exiles,
redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name.
Act for the sake of Your right hand.
Act for the sake of Your Torah.
Act for the sake of Your holiness.
In order that Your loved ones be released,
deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
<small><i>Biblical phrases applicable to one's name may be found on pp. 000-000.</i></small>
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He make peace
upon us and upon all Israel
and say Amein.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days,
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.
And let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
as in the days of old and in earlier years.
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption

in your lifetime and in your days,

before whom our fathers burned
the incense-offering.
The composition of the incense consisted of
balm, onycha,
galbanum, and frankincense—
by weight, seventy <i>maneh</i> of each;
myrrh, cassia,
spikenard and saffron
by weight—
sixteen <i>maneh</i> of each;
twelve <i>maneh</i> of costus,
three <i>maneh</i> of aromatic bark,
and nine <i>maneh</i> of cinnamon.
<small>[Also used in compounding the incense were:]</small>
Nine <i>kabin</i> of Carshina lye,
Cyprus wine [measuring]
three <i>s'in</i> and three <i>kabin</i>—
if he had no Cyprus wine,
he could use strong white wine—
a fourth of a <i>kab</i> of Sodom salt,
and a minute quantity of <i>maaleh ashan.</i>
Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says,
“A minute quantity of Jordan amber
<small>was added.</small>
If one added honey, the incense became unfit;
and if one omitted any of its spices
he was liable to the death penalty.”
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says:
“The balm is nothing but sap
which drips from the balsam tree.
Why was Carshina lye used?
To refine the onycha
in order to make it pleasant.
Why was Cyprus wine used?
The onycha was soaked in it
to give it a pungent odor.
Though the water of Raglayim
was well suited for that purpose,
they did not bring
the water of Raglayim into the Temple
because it would be disrespectful.
These are the Psalms
which the Levites recited
in the Holy Temple:
On Sunday, they used to recite,
“The earth is Adonoy's and the fullness thereof,
the inhabited world
and those who dwell in it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 24</i>
On Monday, they used to recite,
“Adonoy is great and highly extolled
in the city of our God,
the mountain of His Sanctuary.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 48</i>
On Tuesday, they used to recite,
“God stands
in the congregation of the Almighty;
in the midst of judges, He gives judgment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 82</i>
On Wednesday, they used to recite,
“Almighty of vengeance, Adonoy,
Almighty of vengeance, reveal Yourself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 94</i>
On Thursday, they used to recite,
“Sing joyously to God, our strength,
shout for joy to the God of Jacob.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 81</i>
On Friday, they used to recite,
“Adonoy has begun His reign,
He has clothed Himself with majesty;
Adonoy clothed Himself,
He has girded Himself with strength,
He has firmly established the world
so that it cannot be moved.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 93</i>
On the Sabbath, they used to recite,
“A psalm, a song for the Sabbath day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 92</i>
It is a psalm, a song for the future,
for the day which will be entirely Sabbath
and rest for everlasting life.
It was taught in the school of Elijah;
whoever studies <i>halachos</i> every day,
he is assured
of life in the World-to-Come,
for it is said,
“The ways (halichos) of the world are His.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Habakuk 3:6</i>
Do not read halichos,
but <i>halachos</i>.
Rabbi Eliezer said
on behalf of Rabbi Chanina:
“The disciples of the wise
increase peace in the world,
for it is said:
‘And all your children
will be disciples of Adonoy's [Torah];
and great will be the peace of your children.'
Do not read <i>banayich</i> [your children]
but read <i>bo¯nayich</i> [your builders].”
Great is the peace
of those who love Your Torah,
and they will have no
stumbling block [misfortune].
Let there be peace within your moats,
serenity within your palaces.
For the sake of my brethren and companions,
I will say: “Peace be with you.”
For the sake
of the House of Adonoy, our God,
I will seek [pray for] your good.
Adonoy will give strength to His people,
Adonoy will bless His people with peace.

Who is in heaven and on earth
—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and a good life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He, in His mercy, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.

Aleinu

It is our obligation to praise
the Master of all,
to ascribe greatness
to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning:
that He has not made us
like the nations of the lands,
and has not positioned us
like the families of the earth;
that He has not assigned
our portion like theirs,
nor our lot like that of all their multitudes.
For they prostrate themselves
to vanity and nothingness,
and pray to a god that cannot deliver.
But we bow, prostrate ourselves,
and offer thanks
before the Supreme King of kings,
the Holy One blessed is He,
Who spreads the heavens,
and establishes the earth,
and the Seat of His glory is in heaven above,
and the abode of His invincible might
is in the loftiest heights.
He is our God, there is nothing else.
Our King is true,
all else is insignificant,
as it is written in His Torah:
“And you shall know this day
and take into your heart
that Adonoy is God
in the heavens above
and upon the earth below;
there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You,
Adonoy our God,
to soon behold the glory of Your might
in banishing idolatry from the earth
and the false gods
will be utterly exterminated
to perfect the world
as the kingdom of Shadai.
And all mankind will invoke Your Name,
to turn back to You,
all the wicked of the earth.
They will realize and know,
all the inhabitants of the world,
that to You, every knee must bend,
every tongue must swear [allegiance to You].
Before You, Adonoy, our God,
they will bow and prostrate themselves,
and to the glory of Your Name give honor.
And they will all accept [upon themselves]
the yoke of Your kingdom,
and You will reign over them, soon,
forever and ever.
For the kingdom is Yours,
and to all eternity You will reign in glory,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“Adonoy will reign forever and ever.”
And it is said:
“And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.”

Mourner's Kaddish

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Shabbos Shuva:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and good life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
Do not fear sudden terror
nor the destruction of the wicked
when it comes.
Take counsel together and it will be foiled
speak the word and it will not stand
for God is with us.
To your old age I am [with you],
to your older years I will sustain you,
I have made you, and I will carry you,
I will sustain you and save you.

Hymn of Glory

<small>This closing hymn is called “Hymn of Glory” because it sings the praises and great glory of God. According to some scholars, the hymn was composed by Rabbi Samuel ben Kolonimus, the father of Rabbi Judah of Regensburg, known as Rabbi Yehudah ha-Chassid, a saint and mystic. Others say that Rabbi Yehudah himself wrote it.</small>
































<small>The Mourner's Kaddish on page 000 is recited here.</small>

Adon Olam

Master of the Universe Who reigned
before any creature was created.
At the time when all was made by His will,
then was His Name proclaimed King.
And after all things shall cease to be
the Awesome One will reign alone.
He was, He is,
and He shall be in glory.
He is One, and there is no second
to compare to Him, to associate [with Him].
Without beginning, without end,
power and dominion are His.
He is my God and my ever-living Redeemer,
the Rock of my destiny in times of distress.
He is my flag and my refuge;
He is the portion of my cup on the day I call.
Into His hand I entrust my spirit
[both] when I sleep and when I awaken.
And with my spirit my body [too],
Adonoy is with me, I shall not fear.

Kiddush for Shabbos day

<b>The Great Kiddush</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Kiddush recited on Shabbos morning was instituted rabbinically.

“And the Children of Israel shall preserve
the Sabbath,

as an everlasting covenant.
Between Me
and between the Children of Israel,
it is a sign for all time

the heavens and the earth,

He abstained from work, and rested.”

Six days will you labor

you may do no work—
you, your son, and your daughter,
your manservant and your maidservant,
your animals
and the stranger who is within your gates.

Therefore, Adonoy blessed
the Sabbath day, and made it holy.

Creator of the fruit of the vine.

Mincha Service for Shabbos and Yom Tov

Korbanos (Sacrificial Offerings)

<small>The Talmud (<i>Maseches Menachos</i> 110a) states: Rabbi Isaac asked, “Why does it say (<i>Leviticus</i> 6:18; 7:1) This is the <i>law</i> of the sin-offering, this is the <i>law</i> of the guilt-offering? To teach us that when one <i>studies</i> the <i>law</i> of the sin-offering, it is considered as though he had actually brought it on the Altar, and when one <i>studies</i> the <i>law</i> of the guilt-offering, it is as though he actually brought it on the Altar.”</small>
<small>Rather than merely recite the following portions, study them and attempt to learn about the laws and significance of the various sacrifices.</small>
<small>Exodus 30:17-21</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say:
Make a copper laver
and a copper base, for washing;
and place it
between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar,
and put water in it.
Aaron and his sons will wash from it,
their hands and their feet.
Upon entering the Tent of Meeting
they will wash with water that they not die,
or whenever they approach the Altar
to serve, to burn a fire-offering to Adonoy.
They will wash their hands and feet
that they not die;
and this is for them a perpetual statute
for him [Aaron], and his descendants
for all their generations.

Korban Tamid (Daily Offering)

<small>The <i>Tamid</i>-offerings, two daily offerings of one lamb at a time, were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The former was the first public- offering brought on the Altar each day. And the latter terminated the day's offerings. These animals were purchased from the annual half-shekel gifts of the people and were offered on behalf of the entire Jewish People. Before reading this passage we offer a brief prayer.</small>
<small>Some do not say the following prayer on Sabbath and Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
to have compassion on us,
to forgive us all our sins [done unknowingly],,
to atone all our iniquities, [done knowingly],
to pardon all our [malicious] transgressions,
and may You build the Holy Temple
quickly, in our days,
that we may offer, before You,
the daily burnt-offering to atone for us,
as You wrote for us in Your Torah
by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
from the mouth of Your Reverence,
as it is said:
<small>Numbers 28:1-8</small>
And Adonoy spoke to Moses to say:
Command the Children of Israel,
and say to them:
My offering, My food,
to be consumed by My fires,
a pleasing odor to Me,
You shall be diligent to bring unto Me,
at its fixed time.
And you will say to them:
“This is the fire-offering
that you will bring unto Adonoy:
[male] lambs, in their first year,
without blemish,
two [of them] each day,
as a constant burnt-offering.
Offer one lamb in the morning,
and the second lamb,
offer in the afternoon.
And a tenth of an <i>ephah</i> of fine flour
as a meal-offering,
mixed with oil of crushed [olives]
measuring one-fourth of a <i>hin.</i>
[This is] a constant burnt-offering
as offered at Mount Sinai
for a pleasing odor, a fire-offering to Adonoy.
And its libation will be
a fourth of a <i>hin</i> for the one lamb;
in the Holy [Sanctuary] you will pour out
a drink-offering of strong wine to Adonoy.
And the second lamb
you will offer in the afternoon;
as the meal-offering of the morning
[together] with its libation, you shall offer
a fire-offering of pleasing odor to Adonoy.
<small>Leviticus 1:11</small>
And he will slaughter it
on the north side of the Altar,
before Adonoy;
and Aaron's sons, the <i>Kohanim,</i> will sprinkle
its blood all around the Altar.
<small>Some do not say the following prayer on Sabbath and Yom Tov.</small>
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,
that this recitation be
important, acceptable
and desirable before You,
as if we sacrificed
the daily burnt-offering
at its proper time,
in its proper place
and according to its laws.

Ketores (Incense Offering)

You are Adonoy, our God,
before Whom our fathers burned
the incense of spices
when the Holy Temple was standing,
as You commanded them
by the hand of Moses Your prophet,
as it is written in Your Torah:
<small>Exodus 30:34-36</small>
And Adonoy said to Moses,
“Take for yourself spices—
stacte, onycha, and galbanum—
spices, and pure frankincense,
[they] shall be in equal weights.
You will make it into incense,
a compound mixed by a compounder,
salted, undefiled, and holy.
You will pulverize some of it very fine,
and place it before the [Ark of] Testimony
in the Tent of Meeting,
where I will meet with you;
it will be to you holy of holies.”
It is also written:
<small>Exodus 30:7-8</small>
And Aaron shall burn upon it [the Altar]
incense of spices every morning;
when he cleans the lamps
he will burn it.
And when Aaron lights the lamps
in the afternoon,
he will burn it;
a constant incense-offering before Adonoy
throughout your generations.
<small>Maseches Kreisos 6a; <i>Jerusalem Talmud, Maseches Yoma</i> 4:5</small>
The Rabbis taught:
How was the incense compounded?
Three hundred and sixty-eight
<i>manim</i> were comprised therein,
three hundred and sixty-five
corresponding to
the number of days in the solar year,
one <i>maneh</i> for each day—
half in the morning
and half in the afternoon.
From the three remaining <i>manim</i>
the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> brought
two handfuls [into the Holy of Holies]
on Yom Kippur;
[for which purpose] they were put back
into the mortar
on the eve of Yom Kippur,
and ground [again] very thoroughly,
in order to make them very fine.
Eleven kinds of spices were used for it.
They were:
1) balm, 2) onycha,
3) galbanum, 4) frankincense—
by weight, seventy <i>maneh</i> of each;
5) myrrh, 6) cassia,
7) spikenard and 8) saffron—
in weight
sixteen <i>maneh</i> of each;
9) twelve <i>maneh</i> of costus,
10) three of aromatic bark,
and 11) nine of cinnamon.
[Also used in the incense compound were:] Nine <i>kabin</i> of Carshina lye,
Cyprus wine [measuring]
three <i>s'in</i> and three <i>kabin</i>—
if he had no Cyprus wine,
he could use strong white wine—
a fourth of a <i>kab</i> of Sodom salt,
and a minute quantity of <i>maaleh ashan.</i>
Rabbi Nosson of Babylonia says,
“Jordan amber was added
of a minute quantity,
and if one added honey,
it (the incense) became unfit;
and if one omitted any of its spices
he was liable to the death penalty.”
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel
says:
“The balm is nothing but sap
which drips from the balsam tree.
the lye of Carshina was used
for rubbing the onycha
in order to refine its appearance.
The Cyprus wine was used
to soak the onycha
to give it a pungent odor.
Though the water of Raglayim
was well suited for that purpose,
they did not bring
the water of Raglayim into the Temple
because it would be disrespectful.
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>:
Rabbi Nosson says,
“While [the <i>Kohein</i>] ground [the incense]
he would say,
<i>‘Hodeik heiteiv, heiteiv hodeik,'</i>
because the sound is good for the spices.
If half the quantity of incense was prepared
it was acceptable,
but if only a third
or a fourth [of it was prepared]
we have not heard [whether it was acceptable.”]
Rabbi Yehuda said,
“This is the general rule:
If [it was prepared with all its ingredients]
in the correct proportion,
it is acceptable
even if only half was prepared;
but if he left out any of its spices,
he was liable for the death penalty.
It was taught in a <i>Boraysa</i>:
Bar Kappara says,
“Once in sixty or seventy years
the accumulated surplus was sufficient
to provide half [the yearly quantity of incense.”]
Bar Kappara also taught,
“If he would have put into it
a minute quantity of honey,
no one could have withstood [resisted]the scent.
Why was no honey mixed with it?
Because the Torah says, (<i>Leviticus</i> 2:11)
For any leaven or honey,
do not burn from them,
[as] a fire-offering to Adonoy.”
<small>Recite each of these verses three times:</small>
Adonoy of Hosts is with us,
a stronghold for us is the God of Jacob,
Selah!
Adonoy of Hosts,
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver [us]!
The King will answer us on the day we call.
You are my shelter;
from distress You preserve me;
with glad song of rescue, You envelop me,
Selah!
Let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem,
as in the days of old and in earlier years.
<small>The following is the prayer of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah:</small>
Please, by the force of Your great right hand,
release the bound one.
Accept the prayer of Your people;
strengthen us, purify us, Awesome One!
Please! Mighty One,
those who seek Your Unity,
preserve them like the pupil [of Your eye].
Bless them, purify them;
the compassion of
Your benevolent righteousness
[may You] always bestow upon them.
Mighty, Holy One,

His holy Name forever and ever.
And we will bless God
from now on forever.
Praise God.

Uvah L'tzion

The Redeemer shall come to Zion

answer me,
with the truth of Your deliverance.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 69:14.</i>
<small>When the Holy Ark is opened, the following is said:</small>
Whenever the Ark traveled,
Moses would say: “Rise, Adonoy
and let Your enemies be scattered,
and those who hate You flee before You.”
For from Zion will go forth the Torah,
and the word of Adonoy from Jerusalem.
Blessed is He Who gave the Torah
to His people Israel in His holiness.

Berich Shemei

Blessed is the Name
of the Master of the Universe.
Blessed is Your crown and Your place.
May Your good will [be]
with Your people Israel forever.
The redemption of Your right hand
show Your people in Your Holy Temple.
Bestow on us Your excellent light,
and accept our prayer with compassion.
May it be Your will
to prolong our lives in well-being.
Let me be counted
among the righteous,
so that You will have compassion on me
and protect me and all that is mine,
and all that belongs to Your people, Israel.
You are He
Who nourishes all and maintains all;
You are He Who rules over all;
You are He Who rules over kings,
and the kingdom is Yours.
I am a servant
of the Holy One, blessed is He,
I bow before Him
and before the honor of His Torah
at all times.
Not in man do I put my trust,
nor do I rely on any angel;
but only in the God of heaven
Who is the true God,
Whose Torah is truth,
Whose prophets are true,
and Who performs many deeds
of goodness and truth.
In Him I put my trust
and to His holy, honored Name
I utter praises.
May it be Your will
to open my heart to Torah,
and to fulfill the desires of my heart
and of the heart of Your people Israel
for goodness, for life, and for peace.
<small>The Chazzan says:</small>
Declare the greatness of Adonoy, with me.
and let us exalt His Name together.
<small>The Congregation responds:</small>
Yours, Adonoy, is the greatness, the might,
the glory, the victory, and the beauty,
for everything in heaven and on earth
[is Yours]; Yours, Adonoy, is the kingdom,
and You are uplifted over all rulers.
Exalt Adonoy, our God
and prostrate yourselves at His footstool,
Holy is He.
Exalt Adonoy, Our God
and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain
for Adonoy, our God, is holy.
May the Father of mercy have compassion
on the people borne by Him,
and may He remember
the covenant with the patriarchs;
may He rescue our souls
from evil times;
and may He rebuke the Evil Impulse
from those who have been carried by Him;
and may He graciously grant us
eternal survival;
and fulfill our requests
in beneficent measure,
[for] deliverance and compassion.
<small>Mincha Torah readings start on page 000.</small>
<small>When the Torah is unrolled, the Reader says:</small>
May His sovereignty be revealed and visible
to us, soon;
and may He be gracious to our remnant
and the remnant of His people,
the House of Israel;
[granting them] favor, kindness,
compassion and goodwill.
And let us say Amein.
Let all ascribe greatness to our God,
and give honor to the Torah.
Let the Kohein come forward.
Arise, son of , the Kohein,
Blessed is He Who gave the Torah
to His people, Israel, in His holiness.
<small>The Congregation responds:</small>
And you who cling to Adonoy, Your God,
are all alive today.
<small>The Kohein walks up to the Torah and says:</small>
Blessed Adonoy, Who is blessed
<small>The Congregation responds and the Kohein repeats:</small>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed,
forever and ever.
<small>The Kohein says:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who chose us from among all the peoples
and gave us His Torah.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Giver of the Torah.
<small>After the Torah is read, the Kohein says:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe
Who gave us the Torah of truth,
and implanted eternal life within us.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Giver of the Torah.
<small>*(The above blessings are recited by every person called to the Torah.)</small>
<small>When the reading of the Torah is concluded, the Half Kaddish is recited by the Reader. The Torah is then raised so that the congregation can see the script, and the congregation exclaims:</small>
This is the Torah which Moses placed
before the children of Israel.
It is a tree of life
to those who grasp to it,
and those who support it are fortunate.
Its ways are ways of pleasantness,
and all its paths are peace.
Long life is at its right,
at its left, riches and honor.
Adonoy desired,
for the sake of His righteousness,
to make the Torah great and to glorify it.
<small>Some recite the following two Psalms:</small>
<b>Psalm 111</b>
<small>This Psalm describes God's tender concern and compassion for all His crea- tures in general and for those who fear Him in particular. The last half of the Psalm emphasizes the distinguished role of Israel among all other nations as the people of His covenant, and the recipients of His Divine Law.</small>
Praise God.
I will thank Adonoy with all my heart,
in the council of the upright
and in the congregation.
Great are the works of Adonoy;
available to all who desire them.
Beauty and splendor is His work,
and His righteousness endures forever.
He made a memorial for His wonders,
gracious and merciful is Adonoy.
He gave food to those who fear Him;
He is ever mindful of His covenant.
The power of His works
He has declared to His people,
to give them the inheritance of the nations.
The works of His hands are truth and justice,
faithful are all His precepts.
They are established forever, for eternity;
they are achieved in truth and uprightness.
Redemption He sent to His people,
He commanded His covenant for eternity;
holy and awe-inspiring is His Name.
The beginning of wisdom
is the fear of Adonoy,
good understanding
to all who perform [His commandments],
His praise endures forever.
<b>Psalm 112</b>
<small>This Psalm lauds the man who truly fears God and whose utmost desire is to fulfill His commandments.</small>
Praise God.
Fortunate is the man who fears Adonoy;
His commandments, he greatly desires.
Mighty upon the earth will be his seed,
a generation of the upright
who will be blessed.
Wealth and riches are in his house,
and his righteousness endures forever.
He causes to shine in the darkness
a light for the upright
[for He is] gracious,
compassionate and righteous.
Good is the man who is gracious and lends,
who conducts his affairs with justice.
For he will never be moved,
as an everlasting remembrance
will the righteous remain.
He will not fear evil tidings,
steadfast is his heart, trusting in Adonoy;
His heart is steadfast, he will not fear,
even before he sees his adversaries' [downfall]
[Widely distributed charity] he dispersed to the needy;
his righteousness endures forever,
his horn will be exalted with honor.
The wicked will see it and be angered,
he will gnash his teeth and melt away;
the desire of the wicked will perish.
<small>The Chazzan takes the Torah and says:</small>
They will praise the Name of Adonoy
for His Name alone is exalted.
<small>The congregation then says:</small>
His majesty is over the earth and the skies.
He will raise the might of His people,
[which is] praise for all His pious ones,
for the children of Israel,
the people near to Him.
Praise God.
A psalm of David:
the earth is Adonoy's and the fullness thereof,
the inhabited world
and those who dwell in it.
For He founded it upon the seas,
and established it upon rivers.
Who may ascend the mountain of Adonoy,
and who may stand
in the place of His holiness?
The clean of hands and the pure of heart,
who has not borne My soul in vain,
and has not sworn deceitfully.
He will bear Adonoy's blessing
and righteousness
from the God of his deliverance.
This is the generation of those who seek Him,
the seekers of Your Presence,
[God of] Jacob, <i>selah.</i>
Lift up your heads, gates,
and be uplifted
[you] entranceways to eternity,
so that the King of Glory may enter.
Who is this King of Glory?
Adonoy, strong and mighty;
Adonoy, the Mighty One in battle.
Lift up your heads, gates,
and lift up, entranceways to eternity,
so that the King of Glory may enter.
Who is He, this King of Glory?
Adonoy of hosts,
He is the King of Glory, <i>selah.</i>
<small>As the Torah is returned to the Ark the following is said:</small>
And when it rested, he would say:
Return, Adonoy,
to the myriads and thousands of Israel.
Arise, Adonoy unto Your resting place,
You and the Ark of Your strength.
Let Your priests
clothe themselves in righteousness,
and let Your devoted ones sing in joy.
For the sake of David, Your servant,
do not reject Your anointed.
For I have given you good instruction,
do not forsake My Torah.
It is a tree of life to those who grasp it,
and those who support it are fortunate.
Its ways are ways of pleasantness
and all its paths are peace.
Cause us to return to you, Adonoy,
and we shall return;
renew our days as of old.
<small>The Chazzan recites the Half-Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;

praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.

a rest of love and free will,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is not only a rest from daily toil but a voluntary desisting from work to manifest love of God. Iyun Tefiloh.</i>
a rest of truth and faith(fulness),<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It is a rest dedicated to the pursuit of truth and faithfulness, through Torah-study.</i>
a rest of peace and tranquility,
and of serenity and security,
—a perfect rest
with which you are pleased.
Your children will realize and know
that from You does their rest come,
and through their rest,
they sanctify Your Name.
Our God, and God of our fathers,
be pleased with our rest,
sanctify us with Your commandments
and give us our share in Your Torah;
satisfy us from Your goodness
and gladden our souls with Your deliverance,
and purify our hearts to serve You in truth.
And give us as our inheritance,
Adonoy our God,
in love and in pleasure
Your holy Sabbath;
and may Israel rest thereon—
the sanctifiers of Your Name.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Sanctifier of the Sabbath.
<b>PRAYER FOR RETURN OF DIVINE SERVICE</b>
Be pleased, Adonoy, our God,
with Your people Israel and their prayer,
and restore the service
to the Holy of Holies in Your abode,
and the fire-offerings of Israel;
and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly.
And may You always find pleasure
with the service of Your people, Israel.
<small>On a regular Shabbos, continue, “And may our eyes,” on p. 000</small>
<small>(On Rosh Chodesh and on Chol HaMoed, the following prayer is added:</small>
Our God and God of our fathers,
may there ascend, come, and reach,
appear, be desired, and heard,
counted and recalled
our remembrance and reckoning;
the remembrance of our fathers;
the remembrance of the Messiah
the son of David, Your servant;
the remembrance of Jerusalem,
city of Your Sanctuary;
and the remembrance of Your entire people,
the House of Israel, before You,
for survival, for well-being,
for favor, kindliness, compassion,
for good life and peace
on this day of:
<i>Rosh Chodesh</i>
the <i>Festival of Matzos</i>
the <i>Festival of Sukkos</i>
Remember us Adonoy, our God
on this day for well-being;
be mindful of us on this day for blessing,
and deliver us for good life.
In accord with the promise of deliverance
and compassion,
spare us and favor us,
have compassion on us and deliver us;
for to You our eyes are directed
because You are the Almighty
Who is King, Gracious, and Merciful.
<small>If you forgot to say this, see page 000.</small>
And may our eyes behold
Your merciful return to Zion.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
<small><i>At the words, </i>We are thankful, <i>bend forward; at </i>Adonoy <i>return to an upright position.</i></small>
<b>THANKSGIVING</b>
We are thankful to You
that You Adonoy are our God
and the God of our fathers forever;
our Rock, Rock of our lives,
the Shield of our deliverance,
You are in every generation.
We will give thanks to You
and recount Your praise,
for our lives
which are committed into Your hand.
And for our souls which are entrusted to You,
and for Your miracles of every day with us
and for Your wonders and benefactions
at all times—
evening, morning and noon.
(You are) The Beneficent One—
for Your compassion is never withheld;
And (You are) the Merciful One—
for Your kindliness never ceases;
we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.)</small>
We are thankful to You,
that You Adonoy are our God
and God of our fathers,
God of all flesh,
Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning.
Blessings and thanksgivings
to Your great and holy Name
for keeping us alive, and sustaining us;
so may You always keep us alive
and sustain us,
and gather our exiles
to the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary
to observe Your statutes
and to do Your will,
and to serve You wholeheartedly
for we are thankful to You.
Blessed is the Almighty
to Whom all thanks are due.
<small>On Chanukah the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, see page 000.</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles
for the redemption, for the mighty deeds,
for the deliverances, for the wonders
for the consolations and for the wars
that You performed for our fathers
in those days at this season.
In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons,
when the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly,
forever and ever.
<small>(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, add:</small>
Inscribe for a good life
all the children of Your covenant.)
<small>If you forget to say this, see page 000.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever
and praise and bless
Your great Name with sincerity forever;
for You are goodness—
the Almighty, Who is our deliverance
and our help forever—
the benevolent Almighty.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
“The Beneficent” is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing,
life favor, kindness and compassion
upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one
with the light of Your countenance.
For by the light of Your countenance
You gave us Adonoy our God,
a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,
righteousness, blessing, compassion,
life, and peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace
(with much strength and peace).
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence continue here:</small>
In the book of life, blessing, peace
and abundant maintenance,
good decrees, salvations and condolences,
may we be remembered and inscribed
before You;
we and all Your people, the House of Israel
for a good life and peace.
<small>If you forget to say this you need not go back and repeat it.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil
and my lips from speaking deceitfully.
To those who curse me,
may my soul be unresponsive;
and let my soul be like dust to all.
Open my heart to Your Torah
and let my soul pursue Your commandments.
And all who plan evil against me,
quickly annul their counsel
and frustrate their intention.
(May it it be Your will
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that no person be envious of me
and that I not be envious of others,
that I not be brought to anger this day,
and that I not cause Your anger;
and save me from the evil inclination,
and help me be humble and any modest.
Our King and our Father,
unify Your Name in Your world,
rebuild Your city, establish Your house
and perfect your sanctuary.
Gather our exiles,
redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name.
Act for the sake of Your right hand.
Act for the sake of Your Torah.
Act for the sake of Your holiness.
In order that Your loved ones be released,
deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.

May they be acceptable—
the words of my mouth

He Who makes peace
in His high heavens
may He make peace
upon us and upon all Israel

Aleinu

It is our obligation to praise
the Master of all,
to ascribe greatness
to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning:
that He has not made us
like the nations of the lands,
and has not positioned us
like the families of the earth;
that He has not assigned
our portion like theirs,
nor our lot like that of all their multitudes.
For they prostrate themselves
to vanity and nothingness,
and pray to a god that cannot deliver.
But we bow, prostrate ourselves,
and offer thanks
before the Supreme King of kings,
the Holy One blessed is He,
Who spreads the heavens,
and establishes the earth,
and the Seat of His glory is in heaven above,
and the abode of His invincible might
is in the loftiest heights.
He is our God, there is nothing else.
Our King is true,
all else is insignificant,
as it is written in His Torah:
“And you shall know this day
and take into your heart
that Adonoy is God
in the heavens above
and upon the earth below;
there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You,
Adonoy our God,
to soon behold the glory of Your might
in banishing idolatry from the earth
and the false gods
will be utterly exterminated
to perfect the world
as the kingdom of Shadai.
And all mankind will invoke Your Name,
to turn back to You,
all the wicked of the earth.
They will realize and know,
all the inhabitants of the world,
that to You, every knee must bend,
every tongue must swear [allegiance to You].
Before You, Adonoy, our God,
they will bow and prostrate themselves,
and to the glory of Your Name give honor.
And they will all accept [upon themselves]
the yoke of Your kingdom,
and You will reign over them, soon,
forever and ever.
For the kingdom is Yours,
and to all eternity You will reign in glory,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“Adonoy will reign forever and ever.”
And it is said:
“And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.”
Do not fear sudden terror
nor the destruction of the wicked
when it comes.
Take counsel together and it will be foiled
speak the word and it will not stand
for God is with us.
To your old age I am [with you],
to your older years I will sustain you,
I have made you, and I will carry you,
I will sustain you and save you.

Mourner's Kaddish

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Shabbos Shuva:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and good life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.

Psalms recited between Sukkos and Pesach

<small>The following Psalms are recited from the Shabbos after Sukkos to the Shabbos before Pesach</small>
<b>Psalm 104</b>
<small>In this Psalm, David calls upon his soul to bless God because of His greatness and glory, His goodness and wisdom which are visibly demonstrated in the world which He has created.</small>
My soul bless Adonoy;
Adonoy, my God, You are greatly exalted;
with beauty and splendor are You clothed.
Enwrapped in light, garment-like,
He spreads out the heavens like a curtain.
He Who covers with water,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the “Waters that are above the skies” (Genesis 1:6-7; Psalms 148:14).—Metsudas Dovid</i>
His upper chambers;
He Who makes clouds His chariot,
He Who walks upon wings of wind.
He Who makes winds His messengers,
flaming fires His servants.
He Who established the earth
upon its foundations,
[so] that it shall never be moved.
The deep
He covered as with a garment;<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">God covers the depths of the seas in order to prevent them from overflowing and destroying the world.—Metsudas Dovid</i>
waters remain on mountains.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the nature of water is to flow downward God nevertheless ordered that there be water on the highest mountains.— Metsudas Dovid</i>
At Your shout they retreated,
at Your thunderous voice
they hastened away.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence describes God’s command, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place” (Genesis 1:9).—Metsudas Dovid</i>
They go up mountains, down into valleys,
to the specific place You founded for them.
You set a boundary<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The sand is the boundary; the water may not cross it to flood the earth.—Rashi</i>
[which] they may not cross,
lest they return to cover the earth.
He Who sends springs into streams
to flow between the mountains;
to water all the beasts of the fields;
the wild ones quench their thirst.
Over them dwell the birds of the sky,
from among the branches, they give voice.
[You] Who waters the mountains
from His upper chambers,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See footnote 36.</i>
from the fruit of Your works<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The “Fruit of Your works” refers to the rain which satisfies the needs of the earth.—Metsudas Dovid</i>
the earth is sated.
[You] Who causes grass to sprout for cattle,
and vegetation for the labor of man,
to bring forth bread from the earth;
and wine to cheer the heart of man,
to make [his] face shine from oil,
and bread to sustain the heart of man.
Adonoy's trees are sated,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The trees are satisfied with the rain.</i>
the cedars of Lebanon that He planted;
where birds make their nests,
the stork—the firs are her home.
The high mountains [are] for the wild goats,
the rocks a refuge for the rabbits.
He made the moon to fix seasons
the sun knows its place to set.
You make darkness and night comes
in which they move about
all the beasts of the forest.
The young lions roar for prey,
and seek their food from the Almighty.
[When] the sun rises, they gather
and come into their dens to lie.
Man goes out to his work,
to his labor until evening.
How many are Your works, Adonoy!
You made them all with wisdom;
the earth is full of Your possessions!
This sea, great and wide—
therein are innumerable creeping things,
animals small and great.
There ships travel;
this Leviathan<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">According to tradition, God created the Leviathan with a mate but slew her in order that they not reproduce. Because of their tremendous size, they would have brought much destruction to the world (See Rashi to Genesis 1:21).—Rashi</i>

They all look to You expectantly,
to provide their food in its time.
[When] You give it to them,
they gather it in;
[when] You open Your hand
they are sated with goodness.
When You hide Your face,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">When God withdraws His sustaining power from any creature or being, it perishes.</i>
they are panic-stricken;
when You gather in their breath, they perish,
and to their dust they return.
When You send Your spirit,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the era when God will restore life to the dead.—Rashi</i>
they will be created [anew];
and You will renew the face of the earth.
The glory of Adonoy will endure forever,
Adonoy will rejoice in His works—
He Who gazes upon the earth
and it trembles;
He Who touches the mountains
and they erupt.
I will sing to Adonoy with my life;
I will offer hymns to my God
as long as I am alive.
May my words be pleasant to Him;
I will rejoice in Adonoy.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">When God accepts my prayer, I will rejoice in His deliverance.—Metsudas Dovid</i>
Sin will be excised from the earth,
and the wicked will be no more;
My soul bless Adonoy,
Praise God.
<b>Psalm 120</b>
<small>This Psalm deals with the evils of slander and deceit. David pleads with God to save him from those who use speech, not to express the truth, but to conceal it.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
In my great distress I called to Adonoy
and He answered me.
Adonoy,
deliver my soul from lying lips,
from a deceitful tongue.
What will He give you
and what more will He add
to a deceitful tongue?
Sharp arrows of a warrior
with burning coals of a broom.
Woe is me that I dwell in Meschech,
that I reside among Kedar's tents.
Too long has my soul dwelt
with those who hate peace.
I am for peace;
but when I speak
they are for war.
<b>Psalm 121</b>
<small>Without complete trust in God's deliverance, spiritual ascent is virtually im- possible. Thus David proclaims Israel's total faith in God.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
I will lift my eyes to the mountains:
from where will my help come?
My help comes from Adonoy,
Maker of heaven and earth.
He will not let your foot slip,
He will not slumber—your Guardian.
Behold, He does not slumber
nor does He sleep—the Guardian of Israel!
Adonoy is your Guardian,
Adonoy is your shelter at your right hand.
By day the sun will not smite you,
nor the moon at night.
Adonoy will guard you from all evil;
He will preserve your soul.
Adonoy will guard your going and coming,
from now and forever.
<b>Psalm 122</b>
<small>We must never forget Jerusalem, our spiritual home, and we must constantly recall and cherish the memories of the House of God.</small>
A Song of Ascents of David.
I rejoiced when they said to me,
“To the House of Adonoy let us go.”
Our feet stood
within your gates, Jerusalem.
Jerusalem which is built
as a city that fosters togetherness.
There the tribes went up,
the tribes of God,
as a testimony of Israel;
to give thanks to the Name of Adonoy.
For there,
were set thrones for judgment,
thrones of the House of David.
Inquire after the peace of Jerusalem;
may those who love you enjoy serenity.
Peace be within your walls,
serenity within your palaces.
For the sake of my brethren and companions,
I will say, “Peace be with you.”
For the sake of the House of Adonoy
our God,
I will seek your good.
<b>Psalm 123</b>
<small>In this Psalm we pray for God's compassion, declaring that our eyes are lifted to him as our sole source of help.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
To You I will lift my eyes,
[to You] Who dwells in heaven.
Behold, as the eyes of servants [look]
toward the hand of their master,
as the eyes of a maiden [look]
toward the hand of her mistress;
so our eyes [look] toward Adonoy our God
until he is gracious to us.
Be gracious to us, Adonoy, be gracious to us
for we are fully satiated with humiliation.
Our soul is fully satiated
with the scorning of those who are at ease,
with the humiliation
of the arrogant oppressors.
<b>Psalm 124</b>
<small>Israel openly declares that it owes its survival through centuries of suffering to God and to God alone, and that the history of its exile has been a demonstra- tion of God's rule and Presence on earth.</small>
A Song of Ascents of David.
“Had it not been for Adonoy
Who was for us,”
let Israel now say.
“Had it not been for Adonoy
Who was for us,
when men rose up against us.
They would have then swallowed us alive,
when their wrath blazed against us.
The waters would have then swept us away,
affliction would have passed over our soul.
Then over our soul would have gone
the impetuous waters.
Blessed is Adonoy,
Who did not give us
as prey to their teeth.
Our soul escaped as a bird
out of the fowler's snare;
the snare is broken and we escaped.
Our help is in the Name of Adonoy,
Maker of heaven and earth.”
<b>Psalm 125</b>
<small>This Psalm expounds the theme of our trust in God. It proclaims that through God's Divine protection, which visibly accompanied Israel at all times, we have found security.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
Those who trust in Adonoy
are as Mount Zion which cannot be moved,
but abides forever.
Jerusalem is surrounded by mountains,
and Adonoy is around His people,
from now forever.
For it will not rest [for long]
the reign of wickedness
upon the lot of the righteous;
in order that the righteous will not put forth
their hands unto iniquity.
Do good, Adonoy, to those who are good,
and to those who are upright in their hearts.
And as for those who turn aside
to their crooked ways,
Adonoy will lead them away
together with the workers of iniquity;
peace be upon Israel.
<b>Psalm 126</b>
<small>This Psalm voices the hope of our ultimate return to Zion when our tears of sorrow will become tears of joy.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
When Adonoy brings about
the return to Zion
we will have been like dreamers.
Then
will our mouths be filled with laughter,
and our tongue with joyous song.
Then they will say among the nations:
‘Adonoy has done great things for them.'
Adonoy had done great things for us;
we will [then] rejoice.
Adonoy! bring back our exiles
like springs in the desert.
Those who sow in tears
will reap with joyous song.
[Though] he walks along weeping,
carrying the bag of seed,
he will return with joyous song
carrying his sheaves.
<b>Psalm 127</b>
<small>In this Psalm David instructs Solomon, his son, on the virtues of proper training for children. The arrow shot from a strong hand bears within itself the strength of the bowman long after it has left his hand, and it follows unswervingly the direction given by the hand of the mighty man. So, too, children raised by dedicated parents will remain unwaveringly and unhesitat- ingly true to the goal set for them by the guiding hands of parents, long after they have left the immediate sphere of that parental guidance.</small>
A Song of Ascents of Solomon.
If Adonoy will not build a house,
then in vain have its builders toiled upon it;
if Adonoy will not preserve the city,
in vain does the watchman keep vigil.
It is in vain for you
that you rise early, sit up late,
who eat the bread of toil;
but He will surely give [sustenance]
to His loved ones
to those who banish sleep from themselves.
Behold, a heritage of Adonoy, are children
a reward [from Him] is the fruit of the womb.
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
so are the children of one's youth.
Fortunate is the man
who has filled his quiver with them;
they will not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies
in the gate.
<b>Psalm 128</b>
<small>Fortunate is the home permeated with fear of God, and crowned with prosperity and contentment.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
Fortunate is everyone who fears Adonoy,
who walks in His ways.
The toil of your hands,
when you eat thereof—
fortunate are you, good will be yours.
Your wife is a fruitful vine
in the innermost parts of your home,
your children are like olive plants
around your table.
Behold, so is blessed the man
who fears Adonoy.
May Adonoy bless you out of Zion,
and may you look
upon the good of Jerusalem
all the days of your life.
May you see [the] children of your children,
peace upon Israel.
<b>Psalm 129</b>
<small>This Psalm describes the fleeting pleasures, devoid of blessing or permanence, of those who hate Zion and who fight against the Torah which comes forth from Zion, and against Israel who are the standard-bearers of its teachings.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
“Much have they afflicted me
from my youth,”
let Israel now say.
“Much have they afflicted me
from my youth;
but also they have not prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed on my back;
they made long their furrows.
Adonoy is righteous,
He has cut the cords of the wicked.
Let them be ashamed and turned backward,
all haters of Zion.
Let them be as grass upon the roofs,
before it springs up it withers.
With which the reaper does not fill his hand,
nor the sheath binder his bosom.”
And the passers by did not say:
“The blessing of Adonoy be upon you;
“we bless you in the Name of Adonoy.”
<b>Psalm 130</b>
<small>In this Psalm the Jewish soul sings at the way the Jewish spirit ascends from the depths of the deepest misery of all, the burden of sin and guilt. “For with You is forgiveness, in order that You be feared,” for through repentance forgiveness is achieved, and thus it is a Song of Ascent.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
Out of the depths
I have called to You, Adonoy.
My Master, hear my voice;
let Your ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.
If You God should take account of iniquities,
my Master, who could survive?
For with You is forgiveness,
in order that You be feared.
I hope for Adonoy, my soul hopes;
and for His word, I wait
My soul [waits] for my Master
more than the watchman [waits]
for the morning,
[more than] the watchman [waits]
for the morning.
Wait, Israel, upon Adonoy
for with Adonoy there is loving-kindness
and with Him there is much redemption.
And He will redeem Israel
from all its iniquities.
<b>Psalm 131</b>
<small>This Psalm summarizes all the greatness of David's soul in three short verses.</small>
A Song of Ascents of David.
Adonoy, my heart was not haughty
nor my eyes lofty;
and I did not concern myself
with things too great
and too wonderful for me.
Have I not calmed
and quieted my soul,
like a child that is weaned from his mother,
like a weaned child my soul is with me.
Wait Israel upon Adonoy,
from now and forever.
<b>Psalm 132</b>
<small>David sings with joy at his appointment to make the preparations for the building of God's Holy Dwelling, and for God's promise that he and his descendants will be the eternal bearers of the royal kingdom of Israel.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
Remember, Adonoy, unto David
all his afflictions.
How he swore to Adonoy
and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob.
Surely I will not enter
into the tent of my house;
nor will I go up
into the bed that is spread for me.
Surely I will not give sleep to my eyes,
nor slumber to my eyelids.
Until I find a place for Adonoy,
dwelling places for the Mighty One of Jacob.
Behold, we heard of it as being in Ephrath;
we found it in the fields of the forest.
Let us come to His Tabernacles,
let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool.
Arise Adonoy to Your resting place,
You and the Ark of Your strength.
Let Your priests
clothe themselves in righteousness,
and let Your devoted ones sing in joy.
For the sake of David Your servant,
do not reject Your annointed.
Adonoy swore to David,
a truth from which He will not turn back,
“Of the fruit of your womb
I will set upon your throne.
If your children will preserve My covenant
and My testimony that I will teach them;
then their children too
will forever sit on your throne.”
For Adonoy has chosen Zion;
He desired it for His Dwelling Place.
“This is My resting place forever,
here I will dwell for I have desired it.
Her provision I will abundantly bless;
her needy I will satiate with bread.
And her priests
I will clothe with deliverance
and her devoted ones will sing for joy.
There will I cause to spring up
the horn of David
[there] have I ordered a lamp
for my annointed.
His enemies I will clothe with shame,
but upon him his crown will shine.”

A Song of Ascents of David.
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
when brethren also dwell together in unity.
Like the precious oil upon the head
coming down upon the beard,
the beard of Aaron
that comes down
upon the edge of his garments.
Like the dew of Hermon
that comes down
upon the mountains of Zion;
for there Adonoy commanded the blessing,
life for evermore.
<b>Psalm 134</b>
<small>This Psalm calls us to rise up in our present night of exile, and pray for the restoration of the Holy Temple. These prayers preserve the spiritual bond which unites all of us and inspire us to remember Zion.</small>
A Song of Ascents.
Behold, bless Adonoy
all [you] servants of Adonoy,
who stand in the House of Adonoy

Lift your hands to the Sanctuary

Adonoy will bless you out of Zion,
[He Who is] Maker of heaven and earth.

Songs for Seudah Shelishis












<b>Mizmor L'Dovid</b>
<small>Some have the custom to repeat this Psalm thre times</small>
A psalm to David,
Adonoy is my shepherd, I shall lack nothing.
In lush pastures He makes me lie,
besides tranquil waters, He leads me.
My soul, He restores,
He directs me in paths righteousness
for the sake of His Name.
Though I walk
in the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil for You are with me;
Your rod and Your staff,
they comfort me.
You prepare a table for me
in the full presence of my enemies.
You annointed my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
[May] only good and kindness pursue me
all the days of my life,
and I shall dwell in the House of Adonoy
for long days.
<b>Yedid Nefesh</b>
Beloved of the soul, merciful Father,
draw Your servant to Your will.
[Then] Your servant will run like a deer;
he will bow before Your splendor.
To him, Your affections will be sweeter
than the drippings of the honeycomb
and all [other pleasant] tastes.
Splendid, Beautiful, Radiance of the world,
my soul is lovesick for You.
I beseech You, Almighty, please, heal her
by showing her
the pleasantness of Your radiance.
Then she will be strengthened and healed
and she will have everlasting joy.
Ancient One—let Your mercy be aroused,
and please have pity
upon Your beloved child;
for it is long that I have yearned
to behold soon the glory of Your strength.
These my heart has desired,
please have pity and do not conceal Yourself.
Reveal Yourself, please
and spread over me, my Beloved,
the shelter of Your peace,
let the earth be illuminated from Your glory,
we will exult and rejoice in You.
Hasten, show [us Your] love,
for the time has come,
and be gracious unto us as in days of old.

Maariv Service for the Conclusion of Shabbos

Borechu

<small>Unlike the morning <i>Shacharis</i> and afternoon <i>Mincha</i> services which correspond to the two daily communal sacrifices (<i>Tamid</i>), offered in the Temple, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, the evening <i>Maariv</i> service has no counterpart in the Temple service, since sacrifices were never brought at night in the Temple.</small>
<small>The <i>Maariv</i> service was instituted to correspond to the Temple ritual of keeping on the altar the unconsumed parts of sacrifices that had been offered earlier in the day. These parts were kept on the altar at night so that they could be completely consumed by its fire. This ritual was applicable only if there actually were uncon- sumed parts of offerings.</small>
<small>Although the <i>Maariv</i> service was instituted to correspond to this ritual, and may therefore seem to be non-obligatory (see <i>Maseches Berachos</i> 27b), Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi and all the other codifiers have ruled that <i>Maariv</i> has been accepted and hallowed by custom, and is therefore an obligatory service.</small>
<small>The <i>Shema</i> is preceded by two blessings and followed by two other blessings.</small>
And He, the Merciful One,
atones iniquity; and does not destroy.
He frequently withdraws His anger
and does not arouse all His rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 78:38. This verse consists of thirteen Hebrew words. It recalls the “thirteen attributes of Divine mercy” (Exodus 34:6-7). In the evening when man pauses from the rush of his daily activities, he is conscious of having sinned during the day, and thus begins his prayer with this appeal for Divine mercy.—Machzor Vitry Midrash Tanchuma (Pinchos 13) notes that the morning sacrifice (תָּמִיד שֶׁל שַׁחַר) atoned for sins committed during the night, while the afternoon sacrifice (תָּמִיד שֶׁל בֵּין הָעַרְבַּיִם) atoned for sins committed during the day. Since the evening service does not represent Temple sacrifice, it became customary to recite this verse because it mentions that God “atones iniquity.”— Avudraham </i>
Adonoy, deliver [us!]
The King will answer us on the day we call.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 20:10</i>
<small>The Chazzan <i>says:</i></small>
Bless Adonoy Who is blessed.
<small>The congregation responds and the Chazzan repeats:</small>
Blessed is Adonoy, Who is blessed
forever and ever.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe,
With His word He brings on evenings,
with wisdom He opens the gates<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These are the gates of sunrise and sunset through which God, in His infinite wisdom, has divided life on earth into two complementary halves.—Rabbi S.R. Hirsch</i> (of heaven);

The Almighty,
[Who is] living and enduring
will always reign over us
forever and ever.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who brings on evening.
[With] An everlasting love<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This prayer is an abbreviated form of the אַהֲבָה רַבָּה prayer in the morning service. It thanks God for the sacred gift of Divine Revelation that He granted Israel. It declares that Torah alone is the eternal heritage of the Jewish people and that all other goods and gifts of life are transitory.— S.R. Hirsch </i>
You loved the House of Israel, Your people.
Torah and commandments,
statutes and laws,
You taught us.
Therefore, Adonoy, our God,
when we lie down and when we rise,
we will discuss Your statutes,
and rejoice
in the words of the teachings of Your Torah
and in Your commandments forever.
For they are our life
and they lengthen our days,
and on them we will meditate day and night.
[May] Your love
never be removed from us
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who loves His people Israel.
<small>The following three words should be said when praying without a minyan:</small>
(Almighty, faithful King)
Hear, Israel:
Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is One.
<small>The following three lines are to be said silently:</small>
Blessed [is His] Name,
Whose glorious kingdom
is forever and ever.
And you shall love Adonoy your God
with all your heart
and with all your soul
and with all your possessions.
And these words
which I command you today,
shall be upon your heart.
And you shall teach them sharply
to your children.
And you shall discuss them
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall bind them for a sign
upon your hand,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.
And it will be—
if you vigilantly obey My commandments
which I command you this day,
to love Adonoy your God,
and serve Him
with your entire hearts
and with your entire souls—
that I will give rain for your land
in its proper time,
the early (autumn) rain
and the late (spring) rain;
and you will harvest your grain
and your wine and your oil.
And I will put grass
in your fields for your cattle,
and you will eat and be satisfied.
Beware lest your hearts be swayed
and you turn astray,
and you worship alien gods
and bow to them.
And Adonoy's fury will blaze among you,
and He will close off the heavens
and there will be no rain
and the earth will not yield its produce;
and you will perish swiftly
from the good land
which Adonoy gives you.
Place these words of Mine
upon your hearts and upon your souls,—
and bind them for a sign
upon your hands,
and they shall be for <i>totafos</i>
between your eyes.
And you shall teach them to your sons,
to speak them
when you sit in your house,
and when you travel on the road,
and when you lie down and when you rise.
And you shall write them
upon the doorposts of your house
and upon your gateways.
In order that your days be prolonged,
and the days of your children,
upon the land
which Adonoy swore to your fathers
to give them [for as long]
as the heavens are above the earth.
And Adonoy spoke to Moses saying:
Speak to the children of Israel,
and tell them
to make for themselves fringes
on the corners of their garments
throughout their generations;
and they will place with the fringes
of each corner
a thread of blue.
And it will be to you for fringes,
and you will look upon it
and you will remember
all the commandments of Adonoy,
and you will perform them;
and you will not turn aside after your hearts
and after your eyes
which cause you to go astray.
In order that you will remember
and perform all My commandments;
and you will be holy unto your God.
I am Adonoy, your God,
Who brought you out
of the land of Egypt
to be your God:
I am Adonoy, your God—
<small> You must be careful to connect the last words of Shema, ה' אֱלֹקֵיכֶם (Adonoy, your God), with the word אֶמֶת (is true) without pause or interruption so that these three words form one sentence, meaning “Adonoy your God is true” (Maseches Berachos 13a).</small>
—is true—
<small>The chazan repeats:</small>
Adonoy, your God, is true.
<small>This is the first of the two berachos that follow the Shema.</small>
—and faithful is all this,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">All that we have affirmed in the Shema, is true and trustworthy.—Etz Yosef</i>
and it is permanently established with us
that he is Adonoy, our God,
and there is nothing besides Him,
and that we, Israel, are His people.
[He] Who liberated us
from the hand of kings,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He redeemed us from Pharaoh, and saved us from Sichon and Og in the days of Moses and from the thirty-one kings in the days of Joshua.—Etz Yosef</i>
[is] our King, Who redeemed us
from the grasp of all the tyrants.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Tyrants” include Amalek and others who wanted to destroy us.—Etz Yosef</i>

on all those who are enemies of our soul.

He makes us tread
upon the high places of our enemies,
and exalts our strength
over all who hate us.
He performed miracles for us
and vengeance upon Pharaoh,
signs and wonders
in the land of the Hamites.
He slew in His wrath,
all the firstborn of Egypt,
and brought out His people, Israel,
from their midst
to everlasting<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The redemption from Egypt is the source for all later redemptions; it is the source from which our final and total salvation will spring.

He led His children
through the divided parts of
the Sea of Reeds,
their pursuers and their enemies
He drowned in its depths.
And His children saw His mighty power—
they praised and gave thanks to His Name,
His sovereignty
they willingly accepted;
Moses and the children of Israel
sang unto You with great joy,
and they all said:
“Who is like You among the mighty, Adonoy!
Who is like You?
[You are] adorned in holiness,
awesome in praise, performing wonders”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 15:11</i>

<small>The following prayer was originally a compilation of eighteen verses instituted during the Gaonic era as a substitute for the <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i> According to Avudraham, the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> was omitted because of decrees issued against the Jews that banned them from participating in the Evening Service. These eighteen verses, adopted in place of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei,</i> have remained a part of the <i>Maariv</i> service. Some Halachic commentaries maintain that these verses should not be included in <i>Maariv,</i> because they constitute an interruption between the final blessing after Shema and the <i>Shemoneh Esrei.</i></small>

the son of David, Your servant;

<small>(On Chanukah and Purim the following prayer is added. If you omitted it, you need not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei. If, however, you became aware of your omission before concluding the blessing, you should say it at that time, and conclude by saying, “ וְעַל כֻּלָּם , and for all the foregoing.”)</small>
[We thank You] for the miracles
for the redemption, for the mighty deeds,
for the deliverances, for the wonders
for the consolations and for the wars
that You performed for our fathers
in those days at this season.
<small>On Chanukah:</small>
In the days of Matisyahu,
son of Yochanan the High Priest,
the Hasmonean and his sons,
when the evil Greek kingdom rose up
against Your people Israel
to make them forget Your Torah
and to turn them away
from the statutes of Your will—
You, in Your abundant mercy,
stood by them in their time of distress,
You defended their cause,
You judged their grievances,
You avenged them.
You delivered the mighty
into the hands of the weak,
many into the hands of the few,
defiled people into the hands of the undefiled,
the wicked into the hands of the righteous,
and insolent [sinners] into the hands of
diligent students of Your Torah.
And You made Yourself
a great and sanctified name in Your world.
And for Your people, Israel,
You performed a great deliverance
and redemption unto this very day.
Afterwards, Your sons entered
the Holy of Holies of Your Abode,
cleaned Your Temple,
purified Your Sanctuary,
and kindled lights
in the Courtyards of Your Sanctuary,
and designated these eight days of Chanukah
to thank and praise Your great Name.
<small>On Purim:</small>
In the days of Mordechai and Esther
in Shushan the Capital [of Persia],
when the evil Haman rose up against them,
he sought to destroy, to kill,
and to annihilate all the Jews,
young and old, infants and women,
in one day, the thirteenth day
of the twelfth month,
which is the month of Adar,
and to plunder their wealth—
And You, in Your abundant mercy,
annulled his counsel,
frustrated his intention,
and brought his evil plan upon his own head,
and they hanged him and his sons
upon the gallows.
And for all the foregoing
blessed, exalted and extolled
your Name, our King
constantly, forever and ever.
<small>During the Ten Days of Penitence, add:</small>
Inscribe for a good life
all the children of Your covenant.
<small>If you forgot to say this, see page 000.</small>
And all the living shall thank You forever
and praise and bless
Your great Name with sincerity forever;
for You are goodness—
the Almighty, Who is our deliverance
and our help forever—
the benevolent Almighty.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
“The Beneficent” is Your Name
and You it is fitting to praise.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>

life favor, kindness and compassion

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach.
In your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Ten Days of Penitence:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May the pleasantness of my Master our God
be upon us,
and the work of our hands established for us,
and the work of our hands—establish it.
He who dwells
in the shelter of the Supreme One,
under the protection of Shadai he will abide.
I say of Adonoy,
[He is] my refuge and my stronghold,
my God in Whom I trust.
For He will save you from the snare-trap,
from destructive pestilence.
With His wings He will cover you
and beneath His wings, you will find refuge;
His truth is a shield, a full shield.
You will not fear the terror of night,
nor the arrow that flies by day.
The pestilence that prowls in darkness,
nor the deadly plague that ravages at noon.
A thousand will fall at your [left] side,
and ten thousand at your [right] side
but it shall not come near you.
Only with your eyes will you behold
and see the punishment of the wicked.
For you [have proclaimed]:
“Adonoy is my refuge,”
the Supreme One
you have made your dwelling.
No evil shall befall you,
and no plague shall come near your tent.
For His angels
He will command on your behalf—
to guard you in all your ways.
They will carry you upon their hands,
lest you hurt your foot on a rock.
You will tread upon lion and snake,
you will trample young lion and serpent.
Because he clings to Me with desire,
I will save him;
I will strengthen him,
for he knows My Name.
When he calls upon Me, I will answer him;
I am with him in distress,
I will free him and honor him.
I will satiate him with longevity,
and will let him see My deliverance.
I will satiate him with longevity,
and will let him see My deliverance.
And You, Holy One,
are enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
And [the angels] call one to another and say:
“Holy, holy, holy
is Adonoy of Hosts:
the fullness of all the earth is His glory.”
And they receive [sanction] one from another,
and say,
“Holy in the highest heights of heaven,
the abode of His Divine Presence;
holy upon earth,
the work of His mighty power;
holy forever and to all eternity—
is Adonoy of Hosts;
the whole earth is filled
with the radiance of His glory.”
And a wind lifted me;
and I heard behind me
the sound of a great rushing;
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy
from His place.”
“And a wind lifted me
and I heard behind me
a sound of a great rushing
of those who uttered praises and said,
“Blessed is the glory of Adonoy
from the place,
the abode of His Divine Presence.”
Adonoy will reign forever and ever.
Adonoy, His kingdom is established
forever and to all eternity.
Adonoy,
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
our fathers,
keep this forever
as the intention of the hearts of Your people,
and direct their hearts to You.
And He, the merciful One,
atons iniquity and does ot destroy;
He frequently withdraws His anger
and does not arouse all His rage.
For You, my Master, are good and forgiving,
and abounding in kindness
to all who call upon You.
Your righteousness is everlasting
and Your Torah is truth.
You will grant truth to Jacob
kindliness to Abraham,
as You have sworn to our fathers
from the days of old.
Blessed is my Master day by day;
He loads us,
the Almighty Who is our deliverance,
forever.
Adonoy of Hosts is with us
a stronghold for us
is the God of Jacob, <i>selah.</i>
Adonoy of Hosts,
fortunate is the man who trusts in You.
Adonoy, deliver [us];
the King will answer us on the day we call.
Blessed is He, our God,
Who created us for His glory,
and set us apart from those who go astray;
and gave us the Torah of truth,
and eternal life He implanted within us.
May He open our heart to His Torah,
and instill in our heart love and awe of Him,
to do His will and serve Him
with a perfect heart,
so that we shall not labor in vain
nor bring forth that which causes dismay.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
that we keep Your statutes in this world,
and [thus] be privileged to live and behold,
and to inherit the goodness and blessing
of the Messianic days
and in the life of the World to Come.
In order that my soul sing to You
and not be stilled;
Adonoy, my God, forever will I thank You.
Blessed is the man who trusts in Adonoy,
so that Adonoy is his security.
Trust in Adonoy until the end of days,
for in God,
Adonoy, is the strength of the worlds.
Those who know your Name will trust in You,
for You have never forsaken
those who seek You, Adonoy.
Adonoy desired,
for the sake of His righteousness,
to make the Torah great and to glorify it.
<small>The Chazzan recites the following Kaddish:</small>
Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime

all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be acceptance
of the prayers and supplications
of the entire House of Israel
before their Father in heaven.
And say, Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and life
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.
He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,
—and say Amein.

Aleinu

It is our obligation to praise
the Master of all,
to ascribe greatness
to the Creator of the [world in the] beginning:
that He has not made us
like the nations of the lands,
and has not positioned us
like the families of the earth;
that He has not assigned
our portion like theirs,
nor our lot like that of all their multitudes.
For they prostrate themselves
to vanity and nothingness,
and pray to a god that cannot deliver.
But we bow, prostrate ourselves,
and offer thanks
before the Supreme King of kings,
the Holy One blessed is He,
Who spreads the heavens,
and establishes the earth,
and the Seat of His glory is in heaven above,
and the abode of His invincible might
is in the loftiest heights.
He is our God, there is nothing else.
Our King is true,
all else is insignificant,
as it is written in His Torah:
“And you shall know this day
and take into your heart
that Adonoy is God
in the heavens above
and upon the earth below;
there is nothing else.”
We therefore put our hope in You,
Adonoy our God,
to soon behold the glory of Your might
in banishing idolatry from the earth
and the false gods
will be utterly exterminated
to perfect the world
as the kingdom of Shadai.
And all mankind will invoke Your Name,
to turn back to You,
all the wicked of the earth.
They will realize and know,
all the inhabitants of the world,
that to You, every knee must bend,
every tongue must swear [allegiance to You].
Before You, Adonoy, our God,
they will bow and prostrate themselves,
and to the glory of Your Name give honor.
And they will all accept [upon themselves]
the yoke of Your kingdom,
and You will reign over them, soon,
forever and ever.
For the kingdom is Yours,
and to all eternity You will reign in glory,
as it is written in Your Torah:
“Adonoy will reign forever and ever.”
And it is said:
“And Adonoy will be King
over the whole earth;
on that day Adonoy will be One
and His Name One.”
Do not fear sudden terror
nor the destruction of the wicked
when it comes.
Take counsel together and it will be foiled
speak the word and it will not stand
for God is with us.
To your old age I am [with you],
to your older years I will sustain you,
I have made you, and I will carry you,
I will sustain you and save you.

Mourner's Kaddish

Exalted and sanctified be His great Name
in the world which He created
according to His will
and may He rule His kingdom
bring forth His redemption
and hasten the coming of His Mashiach
in your lifetime and in your days,
and in the lifetime
of the entire House of Israel,
speedily and in the near future—
and say Amein.
May His great Name be blessed
forever and for all eternity.
Blessed and praised,
glorified, and exalted and uplifted,
honored and elevated and extolled
be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He;
above (<i>Shabbos Shuva:</i> far above)
all the blessings and hymns,
praises and consolations
which we utter in the world—and say Amein.
May there be abundant peace from heaven
and life
for us and for all Israel,

He Who makes peace in His high heavens
may He, make peace
for us and for all Israel,

Rabbi Yochanan said:
“Wherever you find

there you will find His humility.
This is written in the Torah,
reiterated in the Prophets

It is Written in the Torah:
“For Adonoy, your God,
He is the God of gods,
and Master of masters,
the Almighty,
the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome,
Who has no regard for personages

“He does justice for the orphan and widow,

giving him food and clothing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 10:17,18</i>
It is reiterated in the Prophets,

and with the contrite and humble of spirit,
to revive the spirit of the humble
and to revive the heart of the contrite.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 57:15</i>
And a third time in the [Holy] Writings

“Sing to God, compose hymns to His Name,
extol Him Who rides over the heavens,
with His Name, Yah,
and exult before Him.”
And thereafter it is written:
“The Father of orphans and Judge of widows,
is God, in His holy dwelling.”

Hallel

<small>Hallel, the name especially applied to <i>Psalms</i> 113-118, is mentioned in the Talmud (<i>Pesachim</i> 117a), when Rabbi Judah quoted Samuel as saying “Who recited this Hallel? (Who ordained that this Hallel be read?) The prophets ordained that Israel should recite Hallel when they are redeemed from misfortune as an expression of gratitude for their redemption.”</small>
<small>In time, the Rabbis made the reading of Hallel obligatory on the major festivals such as Pesach, Shavuos, and Sukkos. Since Maccabean times, Chanukah is like- wise marked by the reading of Hallel. On Purim the reading of the <i>Scroll of Esther</i> takes the place of Hallel. (<i>Maseches Megillah</i> 14a)</small>
<small>The reading of Hallel on Rosh Chodesh is not rabbinically ordained, but a <i>minhag,</i> a custom which began with the Jews of Babylon in the second century, and has been accepted by all Israel as an obligatory Service. Because it is a minor festival, the Hallel is shortened on Rosh Chodesh by omitting half of <i>Psalms</i> 115 and 116. On the last six days of Pesach also, only “half”-Hallel is recited to show that our joy is diminished because of the drowning of the Egyptians.</small>
<small>Hallel is omitted in a house of mourning (during the week of <i>shiv'ah</i>) on Rosh Chodesh and Chanukah.</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us to read the Hallel.

From the narrowness (of distress)
I called [to] God,
He answered me
with the breadth of Divine relief.
Adonoy is with me, I will not fear,
what can man do to me?
Adonoy is with me, to help me,
and I will see my enemies' (defeat).
It is better to take refuge in Adonoy<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalmist declares that it is far better to rely on God even without His specific assurance of help, than to place one’s trust in man, even with his promises of assistance.—Siddur HaGra</i>

than to trust in nobles.
All nations surround me;
in Adonoy's Name, I cut them down.
They surrounded me, they surround me;
in Adonoy's Name, I cut them down.
They surrounded me like bees,
[but] they were extinguished like a thorn fire;
in Adonoy's Name, I cut them down.
You pushed me again and again<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalmist addresses his enemies.</i> to fall,
but Adonoy helped me.
The strength and retribution of God
was (the cause of) my deliverance.
The sound of joyous song and deliverance
is in the tents of the righteous:
the right hand of Adonoy
performs deeds of valor.
The right hand of Adonoy is exalted,
the right hand of Adonoy
performs deeds of valor.
I shall not die; for I shall live
and relate the deeds of God.
God has severely chastised me,
but unto death He has not handed me.
Open for me the gates of righteousness;
I will enter them,
I will give thanks unto God.
This gate is Adonoy's
the righteous shall enter it.
I thank You for You answered me,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">According to Sfas Emes the word עֲנִיתָנִי can also read עִנִיתָנִי which is translated, “You have afflicted me.” The Psalmist thanks God for afflicting him, because that affliction became the source of his deliverance.</i>

<small>As a segulah for long life, some people say the following verse on Rosh Chodesh:</small>
And Avrohom was old,

Prayers for Yom Tov

Blessings on the Lulav

<small>Many recite the following prayer before taking the four species (Lulav).</small>

Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us
concerning the taking of the lulav.
<small>If you are taking the lulav for the first time on Sukkos, you should also recite:</small>

and brought us to this time.

Ushpizin

<small>Prayers Said Upon Entering the Sukkah</small>
Enter, esteemed holy guests,
come in, esteemed holy Patriarchs,
to sit in the shade
of sublime faithfulness,
in the shade of the Holy One, blessed is He.
Enter Abraham, and with him
Isaac, Jacob, Moses,
Aaron, Joseph and David.
Behold, I am prepared and ready
to perform the mitzvah [to sit in the] <i>sukkah,</i>
as I was commanded by the Creator,
blessed is His Name:
“In <i>sukkos</i> you shall dwell seven days;
every born Israelite
shall dwell in <i>sukkos,</i>
in order that your generations may know
that in <i>sukkos,</i>
I caused the Children of Israel to dwell
when I took them out of the land of Egypt.”
Be seated, be seated, esteemed guests,
be seated, be seated, holy guests,
be seated, be seated,
guests of faithfulness,
[be seated] in the shade
of the Holy One, blessed is He.
Worthy is our portion,
and worthy is the portion of Israel,
as it is written:
“For Adonoy's portion is His people;
Jacob, the lot of His inheritance.”
For the sake of the unity
of the Holy One, blessed is He,
and His Presence,
to unify the Name Yud-Kay with Vov-Kay
in complete unity
through Him Who is Most Hidden,
in the name of all Israel.
May the pleasantness of my Master, our God,
be upon us,
and the work of our hands establish for us;
and the work of our hands may He establish.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and the God of our fathers,
to cause Your Presence to dwell among us;
and spread over us the shelter of Your peace
in the merit of the mitzvah of <i>sukkah</i>
that we are performing, to unify the Name of
the Holy One, blessed is He and His Presence,
with reverence and love, to unify the Name
Yud-Kay with Vov-Kay in complete unity,
in the name of all Israel;
and to surround us
with the splendor of Your honor,
holy and pure,
spread over their [our] heads from above
as an eagle arousing its nestlings;
and from there [may there be,]
bountiful outpourings of life for Your servant
(son of),
Your handmaid.
And in the merit of my leaving my house, to go out [into the sukkah],
and the path of Your commandments,
I will eagerly follow,
may this be considered for me
as though I have wandered far off [in exile].
Cleanse me thoroughly from my iniquity,
and from my sin, purify me.
From the exalted guests,
the guests of faithfulness,
may Your ears hear
bountiful blessings.
To the hungry and thirsty,
give them their food and their water
in a reliable manner.
Grant me the privilege
to dwell and take refuge
in the sheltering shadow of Your wings—
at the time I leave this world—
to take refuge from the stream [of fire]
and from the rain [of fiery coals]
when You rain snare-traps upon the wicked.
May it be considered—
the mitzvah of sukkah that I perform—
as though I had fulfilled it
in all its particulars, exactness, specifications,
and all the mitzvos dependent on it.
May it be for our good when You seal [the judgements of Rosh Hashanah —Yom Kippur,]
and may we be privileged
to dwell many days upon the land,
the Holy Land,
in Your service and in Your reverence.
Blessed is Adonoy forever, amein and amein.
I invite to my meal
the exalted guests:
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David.

may it be Your will
to consider before You—
this mitzvah of sitting in the sukkah
as though I had fulfilled it
in all of its particulars and exactness,
and the six hundred thirteen mitzvos
dependent on it;
as though I had in mind
all the intended purposes
that were intended therein
by the Men of the Great Assembly.

<small>To be said by the Chazzan at Shacharis Priestly Blessings</small>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us
with the threefold blessing of the Torah,
written by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
pronounced from the mouth of Aaron
and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people;
as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing,
life favor, kindness and compassion
upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one
with the light of Your countenance.
For by the light of Your countenance
You gave us Adonoy our God,
a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,
righteousness, blessing, compassion,
life, and peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace
(with much strength and peace).
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
<small>During Maariv the following is said by some in place of שים שלום on the previous page.</small>
Abundant peace
upon Israel, Your people,
bestow forever,
for You King
are the Master of all peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil
and my lips from speaking deceitfully.
To those who curse me,
may my soul be unresponsive;
and let my soul be like dust to all.
Open my heart to Your Torah
and let my soul pursue Your commandments.
And all who plan evil against me,
quickly annul their counsel
and frustrate their intention.
(May it it be Your will
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that no person be envious of me
and that I not be envious of others,
that I not be brought to anger this day,
and that I not cause Your anger;
and save me from the evil inclination,
and help me be humble and any modest.
Our King and our Father,
unify Your Name in Your world,
rebuild Your city, establish Your house
and perfect your sanctuary.
Gather our exiles,
redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name.
Act for the sake of Your right hand.
Act for the sake of Your Torah.
Act for the sake of Your holiness.
In order that Your loved ones be released,
deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
<small>Biblical phrases applicable to one's name may be found on pp. 000-000.</small>
May they be acceptable—
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart—before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace
in His high heavens
may He make peace
upon us and upon all Israel
and say Amein.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days,
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.
And let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
as in the days of old and in earlier years.

Be pleased, Adonoy, our God,
with Your people Israel and their prayer,

to the Holy of Holies in Your abode,
and the fire-offerings of Israel;
and accept their prayer, lovingly and willingly.
And may You always find pleasure
with the service of Your people, Israel.

And may our eyes behold
Your merciful return to Zion.
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion.
<small>At the words, We are thankful,<i> bend forward; at </i>Adonoy<i> return to an upright position.</i></small>
We are thankful to You
that You Adonoy are our God
and the God of our fathers forever;
our Rock, Rock of our lives,
the Shield of our deliverance,
You are in every generation.
We will give thanks to You
and recount Your praise,
for our lives
which are committed into Your hand.
And for our souls which are entrusted to You,
and for Your miracles of every day with us
and for Your wonders and benefactions
at all times—

(You are) The Beneficent One—
for Your compassion is never withheld;
And (You are) the Merciful One—
for Your kindliness never ceases;
we have always placed our hope in You.
<small>(When the Chazzan repeats the Shemoneh Esrei<i> and says, “Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion”, the congregation responds by saying “Amein” and then the following prayer.</i>)</small>
We are thankful to You,
that You Adonoy are our God
and God of our fathers,
God of all flesh,
Our Creator, Creator of the Beginning.
Blessings and thanksgivings
to Your great and holy Name
for keeping us alive, and sustaining us;
so may You always keep us alive

<small>When Kohanim are present, te Birkas Kohanim (page 000) is recited here, If no Kohanim are present, the Chazan recites the following.</small>
Our God, and God of our fathers, bless us
with the threefold blessing of the Torah,
written by the hand of Moses, Your servant,
pronounced from the mouth of Aaron
and his sons, the <i>kohanim,</i> Your holy people;
as it is said:
Adonoy bless you and guard you.
Adonoy shine His countenance upon you
and be gracious unto you.
Adonoy turn His countenance toward you
and grant you peace.
<b>PRAYER FOR PEACE</b>
Grant peace, goodness, and blessing,
life favor, kindness and compassion
upon us and upon all Israel, Your people.
Bless us, our Father, all of us as one
with the light of Your countenance.
For by the light of Your countenance
You gave us Adonoy our God,
a Torah of life and the love of kindliness,
righteousness, blessing, compassion,
life, and peace.
And may it be good in Your sight
to bless us
and to bless Your people Israel,
at all times and at every moment
with Your peace
(with much strength and peace).
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
Who blesses His people Israel
with peace.
May they be acceptable
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart, before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
My God, guard my tongue from evil
and my lips from speaking deceitfully.
To those who curse me,
may my soul be unresponsive;
and let my soul be like dust to all.
Open my heart to Your Torah
and let my soul pursue Your commandments.
And all who plan evil against me,
quickly annul their counsel
and frustrate their intention.
(May it it be Your will
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers,
that no person be envious of me
and that I not be envious of others,
that I not be brought to anger this day,
and that I not cause Your anger;
and save me from the evil inclination,
and help me be humble and any modest.
Our King and our Father,
unify Your Name in Your world,
rebuild Your city, establish Your house
and perfect your sanctuary.
Gather our exiles,
redeem Your people, rejoice Your congregation).
Act for the sake of Your Name.
Act for the sake of Your right hand.
Act for the sake of Your Torah.
Act for the sake of Your holiness.
In order that Your loved ones be released,
deliver [with] Your right hand and answer me.
<small>Biblical phrases applicable to one's name may be found on pp. 000-000.</small>
May they be acceptable—
the words of my mouth
and the thoughts of my heart—before You
Adonoy, my Rock and my Redeemer.
He Who makes peace
in His high heavens
may He make peace
upon us and upon all Israel
and say Amein.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and the God of our Fathers
that the Holy Temple be rebuilt
speedily in our days,
and grant us our share in Your Torah.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.
And let Adonoy be pleased
with the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
as in the days of old and in earlier years.
<small>On Yom Tov and Shabbos-Chol Hamoed, the Chazzan recites the whole Kaddish on page 000 and the congregation continues “Hope to Adonoy.”</small>
<small>On Chol Hamoed Pesach, the Chazzan recites the Whole Kaddish on page 000 and the congregation continues Aleinu.</small>

Birkas Kohanim

<small>Even though the <i>kohanim</i> are commanded to bless Israel every day (according to some authorities) nevertheless, the custom outside the Holy Land is that <i>koha- nim</i> bless the people only during the Musaf Service of the Festivals, and the High Holidays. One reason given is that the Priestly Blessings are pronounced only in a festive atmosphere. Thus on weekdays when people are troubled with the difficul- ties of earning a livelihood, and even on the Sabbath when people are disturbed by thoughts of their economic plight, the blessings are not pronounced.</small>
<small>During the Musaf Service of the Festivals, however, which precedes the festive meal of the holiday, a joyous atmosphere does prevail and the Priestly Blessing is pronounced.</small>
<small>After the Chazzan's recital of ‘ רְצֵה , be pleased,' the following prayer is recited by the Congregation and <i> kohanim,</i> and repeated by the Chazzan:</small>
May our prayer be sweet before You
as a burnt-offering and as a sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The burnt-offering refers to the עוֹלַת הַתָּמִיד , the daily communal burnt-offering, while sacrifice refers to the מוּסַף , the additional offerings of the Festivals.— Iyun Tefiloh  According to Dover Shalom these two types of offerings can be compared to two kinds of prayers. The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to God. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt-offering which is consumed in its entirety on God’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve God but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים , peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to God, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i>
Please, Merciful One, in Your abundant mercy
return Your Divine Presence to Zion, Your city,
and the order of the [Temple] Service
to Jerusalem.
And may our eyes behold
Your merciful return to Zion.
And there we will serve You reverently
as in the days of old,
and in earlier years.
<small>The Chazzan concludes:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
You alone, in reverence do we serve.
<small>The congregation recites Modim d'Rabbanan, on page 000.</small>
<small>The following prayer is said silently by the Kohanim.</small>
May it be Your will
Adonoy, our God and the God of our fathers,
that this blessing
which You have commanded us
to bless Your people Israel,
be a perfect blessing;
that there be in it neither
stumbling nor iniquity
from now, forever.
<small>The Chazzan<i> then says:</i></small>
Kohanim
<small>The Congregation responds:</small>
Your holy people, as it is said.
<small> Facing the Ark, the <i> Kohanim</i> raise their hands and recite the following blessing until וְצִוָנוּ , You have commanded us; they then turn to face the Congregation and complete the blessing:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who sanctified us
with the holiness of Aaron
and commanded us
to bless His people, Israel,
with love.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The kohanim are commanded to bless the people out of their feeling of love for the congregation of God.</i>
<small>(The Congregation but not the Chazzan answer:</small>
Amen)
<small>The Chazzan chants each word of the <i>Bircas Kohanim</i> and the <i>Kohanim</i> pronounce it after Him. The Congregation should concentrate on their words, <i>but not repeat them.</i></small>
May [He] bless you
Adonoy
and guard you.
<small>While the kohanim sing an extended chant before saying וְיִשְׁמְרֶֽךָ , the congregation says the following prayer in an undertone. This prayer is not said on the Sabbath.</small>
Master of the world!
I am Yours and my dreams are Yours.
I have dreamed a dream

Prayer for Dew

<small>This special prayer for dew is recited on the first day of Passover, during the Musaf Service. (In some congregations it is recited before Musaf.) The Ark is opened and the Chazzan recites the Musaf Shemoneh Esrei from the beginning until וּמוֹשִׁיעַ וּמָגֵן (and Deliverer and Shield).</small>

Service at a Circumcision

<small>Upon the arrival of the child, all those present at the service rise and say:</small>
Blessed is he that comes!
<small>The Mohel takes the child, and placing it upon a designated seat which is called the Throne of Elijah and he says:</small>
This is the Throne of Elijah,
may he be remembered for good.
For Your deliverance I have hoped, Adonoy.
I have longed for Your deliverance, Adonoy;
and I have fulfilled Your commandments.
Elijah, messenger of the circumcision!
Behold, yours is now before you,
stand at my right hand and support me.
I have longed for Your deliverance.
I am happy with Your word
like one who finds great gain.
Great is the peace
of those who love Your Torah,
and there is no stumbling for them.
Fortunate is he whom You choose
and bring near,
that he may dwell in Your courts.
<small>All those present respond:</small>
May we be satisfied
with the goodness of Your House,
the holy place of Your Sanctuary.
<small>Before the Mohel performs the circumcision, the father of the child says:</small>
Behold, I am prepared and ready
to fulfill the positive commandment
commanded me by the Creator, blessed is He,
to circumcise my son.
<small>The Mohel takes the child and proclaims:</small>
The Holy One, blessed is He, said
to our father, Abraham,
“Walk before me and be perfect.”
Behold, I am prepared and ready
to fulfill the positive commandment
that the Creator, blessed is He,
commanded us to circumcise.
<small>The Mohel places the child upon the knees of the Sandek, and before performing the actual circumcision, he says:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy
our God, King of the Universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments,
and commanded us
concerning the circumcision.
<small>As the Mohel performs the act of circumcision the father of the child says:</small>
Blessed are You, Adonoy

Blessed are You, Adonoy

Who sanctified [Isaac] the beloved one,

Therefore, on this account,

<small>The Mohel and the father of the child recite this prayer:</small>
Master of the Universe,
may it be Your will
that he be
considered and regarded favorably,
and accepted before You,
as though I had offered him
before the Throne of Your Glory.
And May You in Your abundant mercy send
through Your holy angels
a holy and pure soul to my son
(<i>Child's Hebrew name</i>)
son of (<i>father's Hebrew name</i>)
who was now circumcised
for Your great Name.
And may his heart be as open
as the Temple entrance,
to be receptive to Your holy Torah,
to learn it, to teach it, to observe it
and to perform [its commandments).
Grant him long days, years,
a life of fear of sin,
a life of richness and honor,
a life in which You will fulfill
the wishes of his heart for good.
Amein, may it so be Your will.

Counting the Omer

<small>The Omer is counted from the second night of Passover until the night before Shavuos. The counting of forty-nine days (seven weeks) between the Festival of Passover and Shavuos (the Feast of Weeks), connects the exodus from Egypt with the festival of the giving of the Torah. Just as one who awaits a most intimate friend on a certain day counts the days in eager anticipation of his arrival, so do we count the days from our liberation till the day we receive the Torah, which is the culmination and fulfillment of our freedom.</small>
<small>It is proper to count the Omer at the beginning of the night, usually after the Maariv Service, and the Omer should be counted while standing.</small>
I am prepared and ready to perform
the affirmative command to count the Omer,
as is written in the Torah:
“And you shall count for yourselves,
from the day after the day of rest,
from the day you bring
the <i>omer</i> as the wave-offering,
seven complete weeks shall there be;
until the day following the seventh week
shall you count fifty days;
and you shall bring a
new meal-offering unto Adonoy.”
Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments
and commanded us to count the Omer.

Master of the universe,
You commanded us
through the hands of Your servant, Moses,
to count the Omer
in order to purify us
from our evil and defilement.
As You have written in Your Torah:
“And you shall count for yourselves,
from the day after the day of rest,
from the day you bring
the <i>omer</i> as the wave-offering,
seven complete weeks, shall there be;
until the day following the seventh week
shall you count fifty days,”
in order that there be purification
for the souls of Your people Israel
from their impurities.
Therefore, may it be Your will,
Adonoy, our God, and God of our fathers,
that in the merit of the Omer
which I counted today,
may any defect I have caused be rectified.
May I be purified and sanctified
with sublime holiness,
and thereby
may abundant bounty be bestowed
upon all the worlds.
May it rectify our being,
our spirit and our souls
from every baseness and defect,
and may it purify us and sanctify us
with Your sublime holiness.
Amein, Selah.

Prayer Before Retiring at Night

Master of the universe!
I hearby forgive

against my honor or anything that is mine,
whether accidentally or intentionally,
inadvertently or deliberately,
by speech or by deed,

nor repeat my sins,
neither shall I again anger You
nor do what is wrong in Your eyes.
The sins I have committed,
erase in your abounding mercies,
but not through
suffering or severe illnesses.
May they be acceptable

and the thoughts of my heart, before You

Blessed are You, Adonoy,
our God, King of the Universe,
Who causes the fetters of sleep to fall
upon my eyes,
and slumber upon my eyelids,
and illuminates the pupil of the eye.
May it be Your will,
Adonoy, my God and God of my fathers
to make me lie down in peace,
and to raise me (again)
to good life and peace,
and grant me my portion in Your Torah,
make me accustomed to do Your commands,
and let me not become accustomed to sin,
Do not bring me
into the grasp of sin,
Do not cause me to be tested,
or brought to disgrace.
May I be ruled by the Good Inclination
and let me not be ruled
by the Evil Inclination.
Protect me from Satan,
from an evil mishap and from illnesses.
Let my thoughts not terrify me—
nor evil dreams
or evil fancies (disturb me),
and may my bed be perfect before You.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word “bed” is used here figuratively for one’s future generations.
